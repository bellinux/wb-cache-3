5|$|The {{airframe}} is of semi-monocoque structure constructed {{primarily of}} aluminium alloys. High strength steel and titanium alloys are partially adopted in some critical areas. The airframe {{is designed for}} a service life of 4,000 flight hours or 25 years, the first overhaul being due at 1,200 flight hours. Block 2 JF-17s incorporate greater use of composite materials in the airframe to reduce weight. The retractable undercarriage has a tricycle arrangement with a single steerable <b>nose-wheel</b> and two main undercarriages. The hydraulic brakes have an automatic anti-skid system. The position {{and shape of the}} inlets is designed to give the required airflow to the jet engine during manoeuvres involving high angles of attack.|$|E
25|$|The Pioneer has {{retractable}} tricycle {{landing gear}} though the <b>nose-wheel</b> remains partially exposed when retracted. An emergency ballistic parachute is an option.|$|E
25|$|The Skylane is a high-wing {{monoplane}} with a fixed <b>nose-wheel</b> {{landing gear}} and {{powered by a}} Rotax 912 piston engine. The enclosed cabin has side-by-side seating for two and dual yoke-style controls.|$|E
50|$|The {{retractable}} undercarriage comprises a steerable pair of <b>nose-wheels</b> underneath the air intake and two main gear wheels towards {{the rear of}} the fuselage.|$|R
5|$|On 11 July 1965. Avro 748 G-ARMV of Skyways Coach-Air {{arriving}} from Beauvais was written off at Lympne when its <b>nose-wheels</b> dug into soft {{ground on the}} grass runway. The aircraft flipped over, losing its port wing in the process.|$|R
5000|$|We {{liked that}} airplane, and found {{almost nothing to}} pick at. However, owners soon {{discovered}} to their horror that it didn't fly or land exactly like a strutless Skyhawk, and some heavy-handed Super-Car drivers managed to smash the Cardinal tail into the pavement on landing, knock-off a few <b>nose-wheels,</b> etc. (apparently, this was possible if one closed his eyes, used full back-pressure on the wheel at the flare and then sat rigidly waiting for the crashing noises to subside). Cessna accepted the blame gracefully. That was proper because, after all, they had lulled a generation of Cessna pilots into near-effortless flying with the extremely forgiving 172 series, and it probably wasn't ethical to suddenly offer, to many of those same customers, a Cessna that didn't handle exactly like a Cessna. The company therefore picked {{up the tab for}} a list of modifications that gentled the Cardinal and returned the smiles to the faces of dealers and customers.|$|R
25|$|The aircraft's design {{placed the}} wing behind {{the cabin and}} allowed easy entry via automobile-like doors {{on each side of}} the cabin. The {{propeller}} is well protected and provides safety on the ground in comparison to tractor configuration aircraft. The airfoil employed is a NACA 4418 giving high lift and a stable stall characteristics. The flaps are two-position and mechanically operated by a flap handle on the cabin floor between the seats. The engine starter is foot-actuated and the <b>nose-wheel</b> steering is connected to the control wheel.|$|E
25|$|The Viggen was {{powered by}} a single Volvo RM8 turbofan. This was {{essentially}} a licence-built variant of the Pratt & Whitney JT8D engine that powered commercial airliners of the 1960s, with an afterburner added for the Viggen. The airframe also incorporated a thrust reverser to use during landings and land manoeuvres, which, combined with the aircraft having flight capabilities approaching a limited STOL-like performance, enabled operations from 500m airstrips with minimal support. The thrust reverser could be pre-selected {{in the air to}} engage when the <b>nose-wheel</b> strut was compressed after touchdown via a pneumatic trigger.|$|E
25|$|Unlike its rival, the Supermarine Attacker, {{which had}} been the first jet {{aircraft}} to enter service with the FAA, the Sea Hawk had a tricycle undercarriage rather than a tail-wheel, making it easier to land on carriers, it was also Hawker's first aircraft to incorporate a <b>nose-wheel</b> undercarriage. The Sea Hawk had adopted a fairly conventional design, being built with straight wings while a number of other contemporary aircraft, such as the F-86 Sabre, had adopted swept wings. The Sea Hawk was a reliable and elegant aeroplane, though its cautious design meant it would only be attractive on the export market, and thus be in production, for only a short period before being superseded by more advanced aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Following the 1965 accident, {{which had}} been caused by the <b>nose-wheel</b> of the {{aircraft}} digging into soft ground, a [...] concrete runway was constructed. It was reported in January 1968 that planning permission had been granted and the new runway came into use on 11 April 1968. Skyways Coach-Air leased an Avro 748 from Leeward Islands Air Transport in 1968 for a two-year period to replace the aircraft lost in the 1965 accident.|$|E
500|$|On 28 August 2009, a USAF E-3C, 83-0008, was {{severely}} damaged while landing at Nellis Air Force Base, after experiencing a <b>nose-wheel</b> failure. The failure {{resulted in a}} fire that caused a reported US$100million in damage. The accident {{was determined to be}} pilot error: at an altitude of about , both the co-pilot and the pilot lost track of their height above ground. The aircraft struck the ground with such force that the nose wheel strut broke. The aircraft slid along the runway for [...]|$|E
500|$|The Victor had fully {{duplicated}} powered controls; many of {{the flight}} controls and flight surfaces were designed with redundancies. Pilot control movements were transmitted via a low-friction mechanical system. This setup was developed to provide, amongst other capabilities, a level of artificial feel to the pilot. Eight separated hydraulic circuits were present on the aircraft, which comprised the alighting gear, flaps, nose flaps, air brakes, bomb doors, wheel brakes, <b>nose-wheel</b> steering, and the ram-air turbine scoops. An AC electrical system and auxiliary power unit were significant additions upon the later Victor B.2, electrical reliability being noticeably improved.|$|E
500|$|The {{first of}} more than a dozen Tornado prototypes took flight on 14 August 1974 at Manching, Germany; the pilot, Paul Millett stated of the occasion: [...] "Aircraft {{handling}} was delightful... the actual flight went so smoothly that I did begin to wonder whether this was not yet another simulation". Flight testing led to the need for minor modifications. Airflow disturbances were responded to by re-profiling the engine intakes and the fuselage to minimise surging and buffeting experienced at supersonic speeds. Testing revealed that a <b>nose-wheel</b> steering augmentation system, connecting with the yaw damper, was necessary to counteract the destabilising effect produced by deploying the thrust reverser during landing rollouts. In August 1976, Soviet espionage activities were exposed trying to obtain information on the aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|First {{assigned}} Design 34, later G-41 by the builder, Grumman, {{the design}} was entered into competition alongside proposals from Bell, Brewster, Curtiss, Lockheed, and Vought. The XP-50 design {{was similar to}} that of the XF5F-1 with modifications to the fuselage nose to house the <b>nose-wheel</b> of the tricycle landing gear and provisions for self-sealing fuel tanks and pilot armor. The planned armament was two 20mm (.79in) cannon and two [...]50in (12.7mm) machine guns.|$|E
2500|$|The Attacker {{suffered}} from deficiencies {{which led to}} it quickly being superseded; one being that the aircraft retained the Spiteful's tail-wheel undercarriage (due {{to the extent of}} the re-tooling that would have been required to alter the Spiteful's wing), rather than a <b>nose-wheel</b> undercarriage, thus making the Attacker more difficult to land on aircraft carriers. This same tail-down attitude meant that when operating from grass airfields the jet exhaust would create a long furrow in the ground that [...] "three men could lie down in". Also the new wing was apparently aerodynamically inferior to the original Spitfire elliptic one, with lower critical Mach number, leading to someone quipping that [...] "they rather should have left the Spitfire wing on the thing".|$|E
2500|$|Like many X-series aircraft, the X-15 was {{designed}} to be carried aloft and drop launched from under the wing of a NASA B-52 mother ship. [...] Air Force NB-52A, [...] "The High and Mighty One" [...] (serial 52-0003, a.k.a. Balls Three), and NB-52B, [...] "The Challenger" [...] (serial 52-0008, a.k.a. Balls 8) served as carrier planes for all X-15 flights. [...] Release took place at an altitude of about [...] and a speed of about [...] The X-15 fuselage was long and cylindrical, with rear fairings that flattened its appearance, and thick, dorsal and ventral wedge-fin stabilizers. Parts of the fuselage were heat-resistant nickel alloy (Inconel-X 750). The retractable landing gear comprised a <b>nose-wheel</b> carriage and two rear skids. The skids did not extend beyond the ventral fin, which required the pilot to jettison the lower fin just before landing. [...] The lower fin was recovered by parachute.|$|E
50|$|The {{landing gear}} is of {{tricycle}} configuration, with hydraulically operated wheel brakes and <b>nose-wheel</b> steering.|$|E
50|$|On 22 May 2002, a Monarch Boeing 757-200 (Registration G-MONC) {{suffered}} {{structural damage}} to the forward fuselage {{in the area of}} the nose landing gear during landing at Gibraltar while operating a flight from Luton. The captain had used an incorrect landing technique, applying full nose-down elevator. This control input resulted in a high pitch-down rate at <b>nose-wheel</b> touchdown, exceeding the design limits, before the aircraft's <b>nose-wheel</b> had touched the ground. There were no injuries.|$|E

5000|$|The THK-11 was a high-wing twin-boom {{cantilever}} cabin monoplane with a [...] de Havilland Gipsy Major {{piston engine}} driving a pusher propeller. It has a fixed <b>nose-wheel</b> landing gear and was first flown in 1947.|$|E
50|$|Some {{models of}} the B-24 Liberator had a putt-putt fitted {{at the front of}} the aircraft, inside the <b>nose-wheel</b> compartment. Some {{models of the}} Douglas C-47 Skytrain {{transport}} aircraft carried a putt-putt under the cockpit floor.|$|E
5000|$|The Sonaca 200 is a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane made form aluminium alloy, it has {{an enclosed}} cabin with two side-by-side seats. It {{is powered by a}} 115 hp Rotax 914 and has a fixed landing gear with a <b>nose-wheel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A notable {{design feature}} of the Albemarle was its undercarriage, which {{included}} a retractable <b>nose-wheel</b> (in addition to a semi-concealed [...] "bumper" [...] tail-wheel). It was the first British-built aircraft with this configuration to enter service with the Royal Air Force.|$|E
50|$|On June 25 and 26, 2016, {{the team}} made another five flights at Moffett Federal Field, {{close to their}} {{headquarters}} in Silicon Valley, California; on the last flight, the plane crash-landed after difficulty compensating for a crosswind, damaging the <b>nose-wheel</b> tube, fairing, and propeller.|$|E
50|$|Working in TsAGI he {{explained}} the auto-oscillation effects of flutter (in-flight auto-induced oscillations and structural deformations), and shimmy (auto-oscillation in the <b>nose-wheel</b> of aircraft undercarriages while on the ground). Both works were mathematically beautiful and practical; both were important as both effects were responsible for many aircraft catastrophes at the time.|$|E
50|$|The RV-7A version {{features}} a hardened, solid steel nose wheel strut that fits into a tube welded {{to the engine}} mount. As in all <b>nose-wheel</b> equipped RV aircraft, the nosewheel is free castering and the aircraft is steered with differential braking, or rudder at higher taxi speeds. The brakes are conventional toe brakes.|$|E
50|$|The R.11 was {{originally}} intended to fulfill the French Corps d'Armee reconnaissance category. Its design {{was similar to the}} Caudron R.4, but with a more pointed nose, two bracing bays outboard the engines rather than three, no <b>nose-wheel,</b> and a much larger tail. The engines were housed in streamlined nacelles just above the lower wing.|$|E
