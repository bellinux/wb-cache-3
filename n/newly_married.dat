500|$|In 1898 {{eight percent}} of those living in the Klondike {{territory}} were women, and in towns like Dawson this rose to 12 percent. Many women arrived with their husbands or families, but others travelled alone. Most came to the Klondike for similar economic and social reasons as male prospectors, but they attracted particular media interest. The gender imbalance in the Klondike encouraged business proposals to ship young, single women into the region to <b>marry</b> <b>newly</b> wealthy miners; few, if any, of these marriages ever took place, but some single women appear to have travelled on their own {{in the hope of}} finding prosperous husbands.

5000|$|The high ancestral {{variability}} {{observed in}} {{whites and blacks}} suggests that each Brazilian has a singular and quite individual proportion of European, African and Amerindian ancestry in his/her mosaic genomes" [...] (geneticist Sérgio Pena). The colonization of Brazil was characterised by {{a small proportion of}} women among the settlers. [...] As there was a male predominance in the European contingent present in Brazil, most sexual partners of those settlers were, initially, Amerindian or African women, and, later, mixed-race women. This sexual asymmetry is marked on the genetics of the Brazilian people, regardless of skin color: there is a predominance of European Y chromosomes, and of Amerindian and African MtDNA. Haplogroup frequencies do not determine phenotype nor admixture. They are very general genetic snapshots, primarily useful in examining past population group migratory patterns. Only autosomal DNA testing can reveal admixture structures, since it analyses millions of alleles from both maternal and paternal sides. Contrary to yDNA or mtDNA, which are focused on one single lineage (paternal or maternal) the autosomal DNA studies profile the whole ancestry of a given individual, being more accurate in describing the complex patterns of ancestry in a given place. In the Brazilian [...] "white" [...] and [...] "pardos" [...] the autosomal ancestry (the sum of the ancestors of a given individual) tends to be largely European, with often a non-European mtDNA (which points to a non-European ancestor somewhere up the maternal line), which is explained by the women <b>marrying</b> <b>newly</b> arrived colonists, during the formation of the Brazilian people.|$|R

40|$|When {{older people}} move {{from where they}} live to go elsewhere, if the {{distances}} are short it is called relocation, or if the move is over state or national borders, migration. Push factors are dissatisfaction with the present residence, or incapacities; leading to short-distance moves to be near, or to cohabit with, adult children, {{in order to receive}} support. These individuals are the ‘old-old’ and ‘oldest-old’, mostly single, poorer, and less healthy. A pull factor is when people want to access a better lifestyle and an increased standard of living. These long-distance migrants tend to be ‘young-old’, healthier, financially secure, <b>newly</b> retired, and <b>married.</b> This thesis explores the migration and relocation of older Orthodox Jews from Gateshead, and studies the priorities and criteria that influence the decision-making process, as well as triggers and barriers to leaving. Being a member of this community, I conducted this research as an insider using constructivist grounded methodology. I conducted 33 in-depth interviews with older people who have migrated or not, including nine with adult children. The migrants ranged from ‘young-old’ to ‘oldest-old’, were married, generally in good health and well-rooted in their community, with extensive social and work attachments in Gateshead. This represents a unique migration in that they are not moving for care, or out of necessity or dissatisfaction, nor are they aiming to increase their standard of living, but to live near and help their children. The decision-making process is both complex and multi-layered. The older people ordered their priorities and considered how their decisions would affect them and their wider network, and taking into account all their resources, select the option that best met everyone’s needs. Decisions were influenced by interdependency with children, neighbours, friends and work colleagues. This interdependency, in which work and volunteering played significant roles, was mediated by reciprocity, the desire not to be a burden, and to remain independent and autonomous. The children facilitated anything that aided these priorities. It was also clear that the demarcation of 65 years as the beginning of an ‘old age’ marked by dependency and infirmity is both arbitrary and inaccurate. Policy makers should recognise the contributions older people can and do make to families and communities. Facilitating and supporting these contributions would improve {{the health and well-being of}} older people...|$|R
50|$|At a later {{appointment}} Becky is distraught {{to learn}} that Venetia is <b>newly</b> single, her <b>married</b> boyfriend having returned to his wife. This sets alarm bells ringing for Becky. As the novel progresses, Becky grows more and more suspicious {{of the relationship between}} Luke and Venetia; even going as far as to hire a private detective. As the baby's impending birth draws ever closer, Venetia and Becky have a dispute during an obstetric appointment, wherein Venetia spitefully confesses that she believes Becky and Luke should never have married and that she has every intention to pursue Luke once the baby is born. Once Becky has recovered from the shock of this revelation she plans to out Venetia's plans to Luke, hoping he'll be similarly horrified. Becky arrives at the party Venetia and Luke are attending only to find the two dancing together. The stress of witnessing this causes her to pass out. When Becky comes around, Luke is apologetic but denies any romantic involvement with Venetia. He admits the truth to Becky about his previous relationship with Venetia. The couple decide it's in their best interests to return to Dr. Braine and for a brief while, and everything seems to be going smoothly. Then while Luke is out, Becky receives photos from the PI that she hired, and discovers Venetia in the company of Iain Walker, the CEO of the Arcodas Group. Only when the PI's son admits his following the two around, Becky realizes Venetia's involvement with Iain in destroying Brandon Communications' reputation in order to force Luke to leave her. When she shows Luke the photos of Iain and Venetia together, he demands Becky to tell him where she got them. She refuses to elaborate and feels guilty for suspecting Luke of having an affair with Venetia. During her baby shower, Becky unwittingly comes across a love note sent by Venetia amongst gifts for the baby. Sneaking away from her own party, she goes to the birthing center in order to confront Venetia, pretending to be in early labor. Family and friends arrive at the clinic anticipating the baby's birth and when Venetia comes into the birthing room, Becky tells everyone present about the obstetrician's scheme. Luke, in disbelief, demands an explanation and becomes increasingly enraged as Venetia talks. As an argument begins, Luke reveals to everyone present that Venetia has always been troublesome, once feigning a pregnancy in order to keep him in a relationship he disapproved of. He didn't regret breaking up with her because of the trouble she caused him over the years. Enraged, Venetia tries one last effort to make him take her back and leave Becky by rudely calling her a dumb little airhead who doesn't deserve him. Luke refuses and tells Venetia off that he loves his wife regardless. Unlike Venetia, who he sees as manipulative and conniving, Becky is a caring and intuitive person who puts others before herself. Whilst revelations are coming out into the open, Becky takes this opportunity to explain that she and Luke are effectively homeless as the home they had planned to purchase has been bought from under them {{in the midst of all}} the trouble Venetia has caused. To console Becky, Suze offers her and Luke her family's unused summer home in Scotland. However, her mother, Jane, insists that they stay with her and Graham in Surrey.|$|R
