40|$|The {{classification}} of ovarian <b>neoplasms</b> on a histogenetic basis according to presentday concepts {{of development and}} structure of the ovary is considered. There are four histogenetic categories of primary ovarian tumours: <b>neoplasms</b> of germ cell origin, <b>neoplasms</b> of celomic (germinal) epithelium and its derivatives, <b>neoplasms</b> of specialized gonadal stroma (sex cords and mesenchyme), and <b>neoplasms</b> of non-specialized gonadal stromal and heterotopic elements. In patients of all ages, 70 % of ovarian <b>neoplasms</b> were of celomic epithelial origin, 16 % of germ-cell origin, 5 % of specialized gonadal stromal origin, and 9 % arose from the non-specialized stroma and heterotopic elements. Before 20 years of age, 59 % of ovarian <b>neoplasms</b> were of germ cell origin and before puberty they accounted for 90 % of all ovarian tumours. The different structural types of <b>neoplasms</b> within the four categories are described.

40|$|Ethylene oxide is a {{multisite}} carcinogen in rodents and {{classified as}} a human carcinogen by the National Toxicology Program.

K-ras mutations were identified in 100 % (23 / 23) of the EO-induced lung <b>neoplasms</b> and 25 % (27 / 108) of the spontaneous lung <b>neoplasms.</b> Codon 12 G to T transversions were common in EO-induced lung <b>neoplasms</b> (21 / 23) but infrequent in spontaneous lung <b>neoplasms</b> (1 / 108). K-ras mutations were found in 86 % (18 / 21) of the EO-induced HG <b>neoplasms</b> and 7 % (2 / 27) of the spontaneous HG <b>neoplasms.</b> Codon 13 G to C and codon 12 G to T transversions were predominant in the EO-induced HG <b>neoplasms</b> but absent in spontaneous HG <b>neoplasms</b> (0 / 27). K-ras mutations occurred in 83 % (5 / 6) of the EO-induced uterine carcinomas and all were codon 13 C to T transitions.

40|$|Abstract. Forty-four <b>neoplasms</b> {{were found}} at {{necropsy}} in 115 gerbils from a colony of wild-caught, and first- or second-generation laboratory-raised gerbils. Ten species of gerbils varying from 24 to 61 months of age were affected. The <b>neoplasms</b> occurred in 18 primary locations and included nine <b>neoplasms</b> previously unreported in gerbils. Unusual <b>neoplasms</b> included several squamous cell carcinomas of middle ear, squamous cell carcinoma of ventral marking gland, and Hodgkin's-like lymphoma. <b>Neoplasms</b> were a significant cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in these aging animals. Gerbils, primarily the Mongolian gerbil (Maiones unguiculatus), have been used increasingly in recent years as experimental animals in a variety of investigations. Little has been published, however, concerning spontaneous <b>neoplasms</b> in the Mongolian gerbil or any of the 14 genera in the subfamily Gerbillinae. BENITZ and KRAMER [2] reported 25 tumors or tumor-like lesions from 106 Mongolian gerbils less than 26 months old, and seven were reported by TROUP et al. [14] in 56 adults.
