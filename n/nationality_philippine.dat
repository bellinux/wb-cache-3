[...] As of 2011, there are 27 Nationality Rooms in the Cathedral of Learning, all representing 18th-century architecture of different countries. The <b>Philippine</b> <b>Nationality</b> Room will function as a regular classroom for Humanities classes. Target date of construction is set for the summer of 2012.|$|R

50|$|Master of Laws (LL.M.) - The LL.M. is a {{graduate}} law degree offered to holders of basic law degrees (LL.B. and J.D.). It is generally offered to law graduates and lawyers of any <b>nationality.</b> Six <b>Philippine</b> law schools so far conduct the program—the Ateneo Law School, which offers an International Master of Laws program; the University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law, which first offered the LL.M.; University of Manila College of Law; Manuel L. Quezon University College of Law; Central Philippine University College of Law in Consortium with San Beda College; San Beda Graduate School of Law; and PLM Graduate School of Law of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (University of the City of Manila). LL.M. programs were once offered by the Far Eastern University Institute of Law, the Escuela de Derecho de Manila (now Manila Law College Foundation), and the University of the Philippines College of Law but were eventually phased out {{due to lack of}} enrollment and funding.|$|R

This is contrasted with the legal principle of jus soli where being born on the soil of a country, even to foreign parents, grants one citizenship. For those born in the Philippines to non-Filipino parents, the Administrative Naturalization Law of 2000 (R.A. 9139) provides a path for administrative naturalization for those who qualify.|$|R

Birth in the Philippines to foreign parents does not in itself confer Philippine citizenship, although RA9139, the Administrative Naturalization Law of 2000, does provide a path for administrative naturalization of certain aliens born on Philippine soil (Jus soli). Together, some of these recent immigrants have intermarried with the indigenous Filipinos, {{as well as with}} the previous immigrant groups, giving rise to Filipinos of mixed racial and/or ethnic origins also known as mestizos.|$|R
50|$|The use of Minnan (Hokkien) {{as first}} {{language}} is seemingly {{confined to the}} older generation, {{as well as in}} Chinese families living in traditional Chinese bastions, such as Binondo in Manila and Caloocan. In part due to the increasing adoption of <b>Philippine</b> <b>nationality</b> during the Marcos era, most Chinese Filipinos born from the 1970s up to the mid-1990s tend to use Filipino or other Philippine regional languages, frequently admixed with both Minnan and English. Among the younger generation (born mid-1990s onward), the preferred language is English. Recent arrivals from Mainland China or Taiwan, despite coming from traditionally Minnan-speaking areas, typically use Mandarin among themselves.|$|R

Filipinos mixed with any other foreign ethnicities are named depending on the non-Filipino part.|$|R
50|$|A {{phenomenon}} {{common among}} Chinese migrants in the Philippines {{dating from the}} 1900s would be purchasing of surnames, particularly during the American Colonial Period, when the Chinese Exclusion Act {{was applied to the}} Philippines. Such law led new Chinese migrants to 'purchase' the surnames of Filipinos and thus pass off as long time Filipino residents of Chinese descent, or as ethnic Filipinos. Many also 'purchased' the Alien Landing Certificates of other Chinese who have gone back to China and assumed his surname and/or identity. Sometimes, younger Chinese migrants would circumvent the Act through adoption - wherein a Chinese with <b>Philippine</b> <b>nationality</b> adopts a relative or a stranger as his own children, thereby giving the adoptee automatic Filipino citizenship - and a new surname.|$|R
40|$|Spanish colonial music, both {{sacred and}} secular, enjoyed {{a long and}} {{widespread}} performance tradition in the Philippines from 1565 to 1898, but this has largely been forgotten or obscured in scholarship of the last hundred years. Musical practices that survive from the colonial period with an intact performance tradition are often reworked, or invented, to serve modern institutional and nationalist purposes, and often function as indicators of <b>Philippine</b> <b>nationality</b> both in the Philippines and abroad. This state of affairs {{is the result of}} both American and Post-independence era historiographies that sought to minimize or erase the perceived Spanish cultural influence on the country. Spanish liturgical music has not been a part of these invented cultural traditions, but recent interest in the form is driving scholarship that may serve as an impetus toward such an invention. Liturgical music is an interesting case among other arts that demonstrate a high level of syncretism with the various additional cultural influences surrounding the Spanish colony: Mexican, Chinese, and Islamic as well as Spanish. The extent to which it exhibits Philippine-ness {{will go a long way}} toward determining its existence as a practice among the nationally accepted and exported cultural practices. The music is part of an international parish style common throughout the colonial Iberian world and there are many common repertories that exist between the Old World, the New World, and the Philippines...|$|R
40|$|Of new {{phenomena}} {{that emerged in}} the State of Qatar, and on a large scale in the post-oil era (after 1950) is domestic servant's phenomenon. Historically, the phenomenon was presented in the pre-oil and limited to the homes of the royal families, pearls' merchants, senior traders and tribal leaders. However, today the phenomenon exists in all Qatari families, under the name of maids, drivers, educators, nurses and others, recently; it began spreading in non-citizenship families as well. Based on the results of the general census of the State of Qatar (2010), the number of house servants reached 200 thousand, from different <b>nationalities,</b> mostly, India, <b>Philippine,</b> Indonesia, Bangladesh and Nepal. This paper aims to recognize the status of the phenomenon of domestic servants in Qatar, to what extent it is spreading in families, the characteristics of these families such as income and educational level, and what difficulties families are facing with this phenomenon. According to the criticism from local and international people, the research is also measuring to how extent the society is accepting the alternatives provided in order to prevent the problems created. In addition to outsourcing of scientific research and data available describing and analyzing the problem, a questionnaire has been prepared to achieve the goals and purposes of this paper. It contains more than 50 questions covering all dimensions to be tested, and have been distributed to the appropriate ratio of different categorized families in the Qatari society...|$|R

During {{the early years}} of territorial administration, the Americans were reluctant to delegate authority to the Filipinos, but an elected Philippine Assembly was inaugurated in 1907, as the lower house of a bicameral legislature, with the appointive Philippine Commission becoming the upper house. When Woodrow Wilson became U.S. president in 1913, a new policy was adopted to put into motion a process that would gradually lead to Philippine independence. However, majority of American initiatives towards the early days of colonial rule were focused on two endeavors (1) preventing the Filipinos to return to Spain, and (2) the gradual phase out program of the Filipinos links to Spain by gradual introduction of the concept of Spanish slavery of the Filipinos throughout three centuries and gradual phase out of Spanish as a national language of the islands.

Members to the elected legislature lobbied for immediate and complete independence from the United States. Several independence missions were sent to Washington, D.C.
