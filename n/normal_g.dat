30|$|Dapsone {{has been}} shown to be {{effective}} for PJP prophylaxis for HIV patients in at least 41 clinical trials of HIV patients (Hughes 1998). Dapsone is a commonly used alternative for prophylaxis of pneumocystis jerovicci pneumonia (PJP) in immunocompromised patients who are intolerant to trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (Hughes 1998). Oxidant hemolysis caused by its metabolite hydroxylamine is a reported side effect in patients with glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) deficiency and therefore screening for G 6 PD deficiency is recommended before the drug is started. Although dapsone induced hemolytic anemia is mostly reported in patients with G 6 PD deficiency, there are reports of dapsone induced hemolytic anemia in literature regarding transplant recipients who have <b>normal</b> <b>G</b> 6 PD levels (Lee et al. 2005; Naik et al. 2008; Olteanu et al. 2012).

40|$|ABSTRACT We have {{characterized}} two stable transformed mouse {{cell lines}} (CG 1 and CTG 1) that express either the normal vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (G) or a truncated {{form of the}} G protein (TG) that lacks the COOH-terminal anchor sequences and is secreted from the cells. These cell lines were obtained using a hybrid vector consisting of the transforming DNA fragment of bovine papilloma virus linked to {{a segment of the}} SV 40 expression vector pSV 2 containing cloned cDNA encoding either the normal or truncated form of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. Using tndirect immunofluorescence we have found that> 95 % of the cells in each line express the G protein(s), although the level of expression within the population is variable. The <b>normal</b> <b>G</b> protein expressed in these cells obtains its complex oligosaccharides in < 30 min and is transported to the cell surface. In contrast, the TG protein obtains its complex oligosaccharides with a half-time of about 2. 5 h. Immunofluorescence data show an apparent concentration of the TG protein in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. These data together suggest that transfer of this anchorless protein from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus is the rate-limiting step in its secretion. We observed, in addition to <b>normal</b> <b>G</b> protein, two smaller G-related proteins produced in the CG 1 cell line...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to low doses of ultraviolet (U. V.) radiation, cells undergo a G 2 delay. In {{this study we}} {{have shown that the}} G 2 delay results in the accumulation of inactive forms of cyclin B 1 /cdc 2 and both the G 2 and mitotic complexes of cyclin A/cdk. This appears to be through a block in the cdc 25 -dependent activation of these complexes. The expression and localisation of cyclin A and cyclin B 1 /cdk complexes are similar in U. V. -induced G 2 delay and normal early G 2 phase cells, Cdc 25 B and cdc 25 C also accumulate to <b>normal</b> <b>G</b> 2 levels in U. V. irradiated cells, but the mitotic phosphorylation associated with increased activity of both cdc 25 B and cdc 25 C is absent. The cdc 25 B accumulates in the nucleus of U. V. irradiated cells and in <b>normal</b> <b>G</b> 2 phase cells. Thus the block in cyclin B/cdc 2 activation is in part due to the physical separation of cyclin B/cdc 2, localised in the cytoplasm, from the cdc 25 B and cdc 25 C phosphatases localised in the nucleus, The data positions the U.
