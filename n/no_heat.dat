5|$|The delay {{caused the}} entire {{production}} schedule to be revised, and cinematographer Carlo Carlini, {{who had a}} prior commitment, had {{to be replaced by}} Otello Martelli, a long-time favorite of Fellini's. When filming resumed in February 1954, it was winter. The temperature had dropped to -5°C, often resulting in <b>no</b> <b>heat</b> or hot water, necessitating more delays and forcing the cast and crew to sleep fully dressed and wear hats to keep warm.|$|E
5|$|Temperature is {{a measure}} of the kinetic energy of a sample of matter. Temperature is the unique {{physical}} property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact. If <b>no</b> <b>heat</b> flow occurs, the two objects have the same temperature; otherwise heat flows from the hotter object to the colder object. Temperature, within meteorology, is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure. In most of the world, the degree Celsius scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes. However, the United States is the last major country in which the degree Fahrenheit temperature scale is used by most lay people, industry, popular meteorology, and government. Despite this, METAR reports from the United States also report the temperature (and dewpoint, see below) in degrees Celsius.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (EDM) or spark erosion process has become widely used in mould making. As well as allowing the formation of shapes {{that are difficult to}} machine, the process allows pre-hardened moulds to be shaped so that <b>no</b> <b>heat</b> treatment is required. Changes to a hardened mould by conventional drilling and milling normally require annealing to soften the mould, followed by heat treatment to harden it again. EDM is a simple process in which a shaped electrode, usually made of copper or graphite, is very slowly lowered onto the mould surface (over a period of many hours), which is immersed in paraffin oil (kerosene). A voltage applied between tool and mould causes spark erosion of the mould surface in the inverse shape of the electrode.|$|E

25|$|An {{adiabatic}} process {{is one where}} there is <b>no</b> <b>heat</b> transfer between the fluid and the surroundings: the system is insulated against heat transfer. If the process is furthermore internally reversible (smooth, slow and frictionless, to the ideal limit) then it will additionally be isentropic.|$|E
25|$|<b>No</b> <b>heat</b> or work {{interactions}} with the surroundings occur, and therefore, there are no transfers of availability between the system and its surroundings. The change in exergy of an isolated system is equivalent, but opposite the value for irreversibility of that system.|$|E
25|$|When {{two systems}} in thermal contact {{are at the}} same {{temperature}} <b>no</b> <b>heat</b> transfers between them. When a temperature difference does exist heat flows spontaneously from the warmer system to the colder system until they are in thermal equilibrium. Heat transfer occurs by conduction or by thermal radiation.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} effects of deep heating (short-wave diathermy [SWD]) and {{superficial}} heating (hydrocollator packs) on tissue extensibility. Design: A double-blind, repeated-measures study. Possible effects of sex and intervention order were controlled. Setting: A clinical laboratory. Participants: Twenty-four subjects with no neurologic or musculoskeletal pathologies affecting their lower limbs. Interventions: Three intervention conditions: deep heating (SWD), superficial heating (hot packs), and <b>no</b> <b>heating</b> were applied in preallocated order to each subject at least 36 hours apart. Main Outcome Measures: Ankle dorsiflexion in weight bearing Was measured by using an inclinometer to ascertain changes in the extensibility of the calf muscles and associated soft tissues. Results: Deep heating increased the range of ankle dorsiflexion by 1. 8 degrees +/- 1. 9 degrees. The change in ankle dorsiflexion after superficial and <b>no</b> <b>heating</b> was 0. 7 degrees +/- 1. 5 degrees and - 0. 1 degrees +/- 1. 0 degrees, respectively. Conclusions: Deep heating, {{in the absence of}} stretching, increases tissue extensibility more than superficial <b>heating</b> or <b>no</b> <b>heating.</b> Superficial heating is more effective than <b>no</b> <b>heating.</b> but the difference was not statistically significant...|$|R

25|$|In a free expansion, on {{the other}} hand, the gas does no work and absorbs <b>no</b> <b>heat,</b> so the {{internal}} energy is conserved. Expanded in this manner, the temperature of an ideal gas would remain constant, but the temperature of a real gas decreases, except at very high temperature.|$|E
25|$|As {{ambient air}} becomes hotter, {{additional}} evaporation {{can take place}} lower in the trachea making {{its way to the}} posterior sacs, shunting the lung surface. The trachea acts as a buffer for evaporation because of the length, and the controlled vascularization. The Gular is also heavily vascularized; its purpose is for cooling blood, but also evaporation, as previously stated. Air flowing through the trachea can be either laminar or turbulent depending {{on the state of the}} bird. When the common ostrich is breathing normally, under <b>no</b> <b>heat</b> stress, air flow is laminar. When the common ostrich is experiencing heat stress from the environment the air flow is considered turbulent. This suggests that laminar air flow causes little to <b>no</b> <b>heat</b> transfer, while under heat stress turbulent airflow can cause maximum heat transfer within the trachea.|$|E
25|$|In thermodynamics, {{adiabatic}} {{changes are}} {{those that do not}} increase the entropy. They occur slowly in comparison to the other characteristic timescales of the system of interest, and allow heat flow only between objects at the same temperature. For isolated systems, an adiabatic change allows <b>no</b> <b>heat</b> to flow in or out.|$|E

25|$|The huts {{range from}} very basic (Liki North) {{with little more}} than a roof, to luxurious with log fires and running water (Meru Mt Kenya Lodge). Most huts have <b>no</b> <b>heat</b> or light, but are spacious with dormitories and {{communal}} areas. They also offer separate accommodation for porters and guides. The communal areas of the huts can be used by campers wishing to retreat from the weather or to store food away from the hyaena and hyraxes.|$|E
25|$|The heat {{drawn from}} ground-sourced systems is {{in most cases}} stored solar heat, and {{it should not be}} {{confused}} with direct geothermal heating, though the latter will contribute in some small measure to all heat in the ground. True geothermal heat, when used for heating, requires a circulation pump but <b>no</b> <b>heat</b> pump, since for this technology the ground temperature is higher than that of the space that is to be heated, so the technology relies only upon simple heat convection.|$|E
25|$|A {{majority}} of Black hairstyles involve parting the natural hair into individual sections before styling.

25|$|In thermodynamics, the Joule–Thomson effect (also {{known as}} the Joule–Kelvin effect, Kelvin–Joule effect, or Joule–Thomson expansion) {{describes}} the temperature change of a real gas or liquid (as differentiated from an ideal gas) when it is forced through a valve or porous plug while kept insulated so that <b>no</b> <b>heat</b> is exchanged with the environment. This procedure is called a throttling process or Joule–Thomson process. At room temperature, all gases except hydrogen, helium and neon cool upon expansion by the Joule–Thomson process; these three gases experience the same effect but only at lower temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Light {{emitting}} diode (LED) lamps {{are used}} for both general and special-purpose lighting. Compared to fluorescent bulbs, their advantages are that they contain no mercury, they turn on instantly at any temperature, their extremely long lifetime is unaffected by cycling on and off, they have no glass to break, and they don't emit UV rays that fade colored materials. LED lamps radiate almost <b>no</b> <b>heat,</b> and can be either multi-directional or unidirectional, {{eliminating the need for}} a mirrored reflector in the bulb or fixture. LED lamps can emit saturated colored light. Disadvantages include spectrum limitations due to discrete emission colors, and higher up-front cost than incandescent bulbs.|$|E
25|$|The {{availability}} of a suitable catalyst {{is also an important}} factor in deciding whether to build an alkylation plant. If sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is used, significant volumes are needed. Access to a suitable plant is required for the supply of fresh acid and the disposition of spent acid. If a sulfuric acid plant must be constructed specifically to support an alkylation unit, such construction will {{have a significant impact on}} both the initial requirements for capital and ongoing costs of operation. Alternatively it is possible to install a WSA Process unit to regenerate the spent acid. No drying of the gas takes place. This means that there will be no loss of acid, no acidic waste material and <b>no</b> <b>heat</b> is lost in process gas reheating. The selective condensation in the WSA condenser ensures that the regenerated fresh acid will be 98% weight, even with the humid process gas. It is possible to combine spent acid regeneration with disposal of hydrogen sulfide by using the hydrogen sulfide as a fuel.|$|E

25|$|The {{theoretical}} maximum {{efficiency of}} any type of power generation system is never reached in practice, {{and it does not}} consider other steps in power generation, such as production, transportation and storage of fuel and conversion of the electricity into mechanical power. However, this calculation allows the comparison of different types of power generation. The maximum theoretical energy efficiency of a fuel cell is 83%, operating at low power density and using pure hydrogen and oxygen as reactants (assuming <b>no</b> <b>heat</b> recapture) According to the World Energy Council, this compares with a maximum theoretical efficiency of 58% for internal combustion engines. While these efficiencies are not approached in most real world applications, high-temperature fuel cells (solid oxide fuel cells or molten carbonate fuel cells) can theoretically be combined with gas turbines to allow stationary fuel cells to come closer to the theoretical limit. A gas turbine would capture heat from the fuel cell and turn it into mechanical energy to increase the fuel cell's operational efficiency. This solution has been predicted to increase total efficiency to as much as 80%.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1970s, Van Zandt {{split from}} his {{longtime}} manager, Kevin Eggers. He {{found a new}} manager, John Lomax III (grandson of the famed folk music historian John Lomax), who set up a fan club for Van Zandt. Though the club was only advertised through small ads {{in the back of}} music magazines, Lomax immediately began to receive hundreds of impassioned letters from around the world written by people who felt touched by Van Zandt. Some of the letters described how his material often served as a crutch for those who were dealing with depression. In 1978, the singer fired Lomax and re-hired Eggers. He soon signed with Eggers' new label, Tomato Records. The following year, he recorded Flyin' Shoes; he would not release another album until 1987's At My Window. Despite critical acclaim, he remained a cult figure. He normally played small venues (often to crowds of fewer than fifty people) but began to move towards playing larger venues (and even made a handful of television appearances) during the 1990s. For much of the 1970s, he lived a reclusive life outside of Nashville in a tin-roofed, bare-boards shack with <b>no</b> <b>heat,</b> plumbing or telephone, occasionally appearing in town to play shows.|$|E
