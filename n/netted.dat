40|$|Abstract: Reconfigurable Object <b>Nets</b> (RONs) {{have been}} {{implemented}} in our group to support the visual specification of controlled rule-based transformations of marked place/transition (P/T) <b>nets.</b> RONs are high-level <b>nets</b> (system <b>nets)</b> with two types of tokens: object <b>nets</b> (P/T <b>nets)</b> and <b>net</b> transformation rules. System <b>net</b> transitions can be of different types to fire object <b>net</b> transitions, move object <b>nets</b> through the system <b>net,</b> or to apply a <b>net</b> transformation rule to an object <b>net.</b> The disadvantage of the RON approach and tool is the limitation of object <b>nets</b> to P/T <b>nets</b> and the limitation of the underlying semantics of RONs due to the fixed types for system <b>net</b> transitions. Often, a more general approach is preferred where the type of object <b>nets</b> and the behavior of reconfigurations may be defined in a more flexible way. In this paper, we propose to use Algebraic High-Level <b>nets</b> with in-dividual tokens (AHLI <b>nets)</b> as system <b>nets.</b> In this more general approach, tokens may be any type of Petri <b>nets,</b> defined by the corresponding algebraic signature and algebra. To support this general approach, a development environment for AHLI <b>nets</b> is currently implemented which allows the user to edit and simulate AHLI <b>nets.</b> We present the formalization of RONs as special AHLI <b>nets</b> and describe {{the current state of}} the AHLI <b>net</b> tool environment...|$|R

It relieves the programmer of a Petri <b>net</b> tool from implementing standard functionality on Petri <b>nets.</b> In this paper, we briey discuss the motivation, the concepts, {{and the realization}} of the Petri <b>Net</b> Kernel. 1 Introduction The Petri <b>Net</b> Kernel (PNK) is {{an infrastructure}} for building Petri <b>net</b> toolsit is not a Petri <b>net</b> tool itself. The Petri <b>Net</b> Kernel relieves the programmer of a Petri <b>net</b> tool from implementing standard functions on Petri <b>nets</b> such as loading or saving a <b>net,</b> accessing or modifying the <b>net</b> structure. Moreover, the Petri <b>Net</b> Kernel relieves the programmer from building a graphical user interface. The Petri <b>Net</b> Kernel is not restricted to a particular Petri <b>net</b> type. It is possible to use the Petri <b>Net</b> Kernel with one's own Petri <b>net</b> type and its specic extensions.

40|$|The {{main idea}} behind Reconfigurable Object <b>Nets</b> (RONs) is the {{integration}} of transition firing and rule-based <b>net</b> structure transformation of place/transition <b>nets</b> during system simulation. RONs are high-level <b>nets</b> with two types of tokens: object <b>nets</b> (place/transition <b>nets)</b> and <b>net</b> transformation rules (a dedicated type of graph transformation rules). Firing of high-level transitions may involve firing of object <b>net</b> transitions, transporting object <b>net</b> tokens through the high-level <b>net,</b> and applying <b>net</b> transformation rules to object <b>nets.</b> <b>Net</b> transformations include <b>net</b> modifications such as merging or splitting of object <b>nets,</b> and <b>net</b> refinement. This approach increases the expressiveness of Petri <b>nets</b> and is especially suited to model mobile distributed processes. The paper presents a visual editor for RONs which has been developed in a student project at TU Berlin in summer 2007. The visual editor itself has been realized as a plug-in for ECLIPSE using the ECLIPSE Modeling Framework (EMF) and Graphical Editor Framework (GEF) plug-ins...|$|R
