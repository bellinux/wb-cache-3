40|$|Purpose: A {{computational}} {{system was}} developed for this paper in the C++ programming language, to create a 125 I radioactive seed <b>entry</b> <b>file,</b> based on the positioning of a virtual grid (template) in voxel geometries, {{with the purpose of}} performing prostate cancer treatment simulations using the MCNPX code. Methods: The system is fed with information from the planning system with regard to each seed’s location and its depth, and an <b>entry</b> <b>file</b> is automatically created with all the cards (instructions) for each seed regarding their cell blocks and surfaces spread out spatially in the 3 D environment. The system provides with precision a reproduction of the clinical scenario for the MCNPX code’s simulation environment, thereby allowing the technique’s in-depth study. Results and Conclusion: The preliminary results from this study showed that the lateral penumbra of uniform scanning proton beams was less sensitive In order to validate the computational system, an <b>entry</b> <b>file</b> was created with 88 125 I seeds that were inserted in the phantom’s MAX 06 prostate region with initial activity determined for the seeds at the 0. 27 mCi value. Isodose curves were obtained in all the prostate slices in 5 mm steps in the 7 to 10 cm interval, totaling 7 slices. Variance reduction techniques were applied in order to optimize computational time and the reduction of uncertainties such as photon and electron energy interruptions in 4 keV and forced collisions regarding cells of interest. Through the acquisition of isodose curves, the results obtained show that hot spots have values above 300 Gy, as anticipated in literature, stressing the importance of the sources’ correct positioning, in which the computational system developed provides, in order not to release excessive doses in adjacent risk organs. The 144 Gy prescription curve showed in the validation process that it covers perfectly {{a large percentage of the}} volume, at the same time that it demonstrates a large decline for short distances.

40|$|A {{common and}} {{important}} feature of many safety critical interactive devices is <b>number</b> <b>entry.</b> In hospitals, <b>number</b> <b>entry</b> {{takes the form of}} setting drug parameters such as doses, volumes, etc. There are several ways a <b>number</b> <b>entry</b> interface can be designed - with different consequences for error and speed. Nurses and healthcare practitioners usually have to interact with different interfaces often under pressure and stress of taking care of patients with different health conditions. Error rates in practice are low, undetected error rates are even lower and obtaining {{the context in which the}} errors occur is often incredibly difficult due to poor logging systems in many medical devices and high cost of planning and conducting empirical studies. Laboratory based studies also suffer similar limitations in that, without interventions, error rates are also too low to study. This paper explores the benefits of using a gaming context to study safety critical systems. We argue that a game paradigm provides a way that overcomes many of the problems of studying low error rates in safety critical systems and specifically for <b>number</b> <b>entry</b> in medical contexts...|$|R

5000|$|A similar game, {{referred}} to as a [...] "Luring Lottery", was actually played by the editors of Scientific American in the 1980s. To enter the contest once, readers had to send in a postcard with the number [...] "1" [...] written on it. They were also explicitly permitted to submit as many entries as they wished by sending in a single postcard bearing the <b>number</b> of <b>entries</b> they wished to submit. The prize was one million dollars divided by the total <b>number</b> of <b>entries</b> received, to be awarded to the submitter of a randomly chosen entry. Thus a reader who submitted a large <b>number</b> of <b>entries</b> increased his or her chances of winning but reduced the maximum possible value of the prize. It can be shown mathematically that one maximizes one's average winnings in this game by submitting a <b>number</b> of <b>entries</b> equal to the total <b>number</b> of <b>entries</b> of others. Of course, if others take this into account, then this strategy translates into a runaway reaction to unbounded <b>number</b> of <b>entries</b> being submitted.|$|R

40|$|People {{are prone}} to errors in many aspects of life, {{including}} when entering numbers. The effects of these errors can be disastrous, for example when an incorrect number is entered when programming a medical infusion pump or when entering financial information into a system. Designing better systems may help to prevent these errors however, {{in order to do}} this we need to understand far more about the types of errors being made, and their causes. Unfortunately, there are very few documented examples of <b>number</b> <b>entry</b> errors and thus many of the studies conducted so far rely upon modelled, not real world data. This paper reports a study that was designed to elicit <b>number</b> <b>entry</b> errors and the subsequent process of creating a taxonomy of errors from the information gathered. A total of 345 errors were gathered. A method for classifying the errors using 13 codes is proposed — this is a significantly higher figure than previously suggested, showing that currently we underestimate the true variety of such errors. These codes are then organised into a taxonomy similar to that of Zhang et al (2004). We show how this taxonomy can be used to guide future research into <b>number</b> <b>entry</b> errors by suggesting experimental conditions needed to provoke certain errors. The taxonomy may also be used during the initial stages of design to help the designer understand the categories of errors that users are most likely to make and thus design accordingly. <b>Number</b> <b>entry,</b> Human error, Taxonomy of error 1...|$|R
