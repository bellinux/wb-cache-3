5|$|The {{completion}} of Fort Mohave {{began the process}} of military subjugation of the Mohave, and the <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> the establishment of reservations. In 1863, Charles Debrille Poston, the first Superintendent of Indian Affairs of the Arizona Territory, called a conference between the Chemehuevi and Irataba's faction of the Mohave, in which he convinced them to form an alliance with the US against the Apache. The treaty was never ratified by the US Congress but formed {{an important step in}} establishing friendly relations between the Mohave and the US government following the military campaigns and the establishment of Fort Mohave.|$|E
5|$|The new route turned {{west from}} Muong May, at the {{southern}} end of Laos, and paralleled the Kong River into Cambodia. Eventually, this network extended past Siem Prang and reached the Mekong River near Stung Treng. The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> the seizure of the town of Kratie, in east central Cambodia, on 5 May. The 470th cleared the population out of the Mekong River town and turned it into its administrative headquarters. PAVN Base Areas to the east were fed by Kratie while men and supplies headed for the Mekong Delta region of South Vietnam were now circled westward, around Phanom Penh, through the foothills of the Cardamom Mountains and then east again to cross the border.|$|E
5|$|The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> {{to broach}} {{the matter with}} the Canadians. The Lord President, Sir John Anderson, as the {{minister}} responsible for Tube Alloys, wrote to the British High Commissioner to Canada, Malcolm MacDonald, who {{had been involved in}} Tube Alloys negotiations with Canada regarding Eldorado's uranium mine at Port Radium and its refinery in Port Hope, Ontario. On 19 February 1942, MacDonald, Thomson and Wallace Akers, the director of Tube Alloys, met with C. J. Mackenzie, the president of the NRC, who enthusiastically supported the proposal. The following day he took them to see C. D. Howe, the Minister of Munitions and Supply.|$|E
40|$|A brief {{overview}} of the large accelerator-based facilities in operation and under construction is given. The proposals and ideas for the <b>next</b> <b>steps</b> <b>are</b> outlined with emphasis on elementary particle physics. Approaches to organize these <b>next</b> <b>steps</b> <b>are</b> discussed, and the possible role of CERN is presented...|$|R
30|$|The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> the {{convergence}} of the amplitude.|$|R
50|$|The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> {{to define}} the atomic formulas.|$|R
5|$|The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> {{to take an}} oral {{examination}} and to diagnose a patient. After less than two weeks, he took his degree and became a doctor, {{at the age of}} 28. During the summer, Linnaeus met a friend from Uppsala, Peter Artedi. Before their departure from Uppsala, Artedi and Linnaeus had decided should one of them die, the survivor would finish the other's work. Ten weeks later, Artedi drowned in one of the canals of Amsterdam, and his unfinished manuscript on the classification of fish was left to Linnaeus to complete.|$|E
5|$|A {{vote was}} taken {{after a long}} day of speeches, each colony casting a single vote, as always. The {{delegation}} for each colony numbered from two to seven members, and each delegation voted amongst themselves to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York delegation abstained, lacking permission to vote for independence. Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between Thomas McKean (who voted yes) and George Read (who voted no). The remaining nine delegations voted in favor of independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole. The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> for the resolution to be voted upon by Congress itself. Edward Rutledge of South Carolina was opposed to Lee's resolution but desirous of unanimity, and he moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.|$|E
5|$|When {{it became}} clear to Tiberius that support for Sejanus was not as strong as the emperor had feared, his <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to choose Naevius Sutorius Macro, {{previously}} prefect of the vigiles (Roman police and fire department), to replace Sejanus and effect his downfall. On October 18, AD 31, Sejanus was summoned to a Senate meeting by a letter from Tiberius, ostensibly to bestow the tribunician powers upon him. At dawn, he entered the Senate; but while the letter was being read, Macro assumed control of the Praetorian Guard and members of the vigiles led by Graecinius Laco surrounded the building. The senators at first congratulated Sejanus but when the letter, which first digressed into completely unrelated matters, suddenly denounced him and ordered his arrest, he was immediately surrounded and escorted to prison.|$|E
50|$|Following this, the <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> the subwavelength cavity resonator.|$|R
50|$|The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> to {{estimate}} a new transition matrix.|$|R
30|$|The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> {{least squares}} channel {{estimation}} and zero-forcing equalization.|$|R
5|$|With {{the end of}} the war in August 1945, the Manhattan Project's {{priority}} {{shifted from}} speed to economy and efficiency. By early 1946, with K-27 in operation, the K-25 plant was producing 3.6kg per day, enriched to 30 percent. The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to increase the enrichment further to 60 percent. This was achieved on 20 July 1946. This presented a problem, because Y-12 was not equipped to handle feed that was so highly enriched, but the Los Alamos Laboratory required 95 percent. For a time, product was mixed with feed to reduce the enrichment to 30 percent. Taking the concentration up to 95 percent raised a number of safety concerns, as there was the risk of a criticality accident.|$|E
5|$|In 1905 {{passage of}} the Moore {{amendment}} expanded the state's Nicholson local option law to apply to all liquor license applicants within a local township or city ward. The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to seek countywide prohibition. The IASL appealed to the general public, holding large rallies in Indianapolis and elsewhere, to support a county option law that would provide a more restrictive ban on alcohol. In September 1908 Indiana governor J. Frank Hanly, a Methodist, Republican, and teetotaler, called for a special legislative session to establish a county option that would allow county voters to prohibit alcohol sales throughout their county. The state legislature passed the bill with only a narrow margin. By November 1909 seventy of Indiana's ninety-two counties were dry. In 1911 a Democratic legislative majority replaced the county option with the Proctor law, a less-geographically restrictive local option, {{and the number of}} dry counties was reduced to twenty-six. Despite the setback prohibition advocates continued to lobby legislators for support. In December 1917 several temperance organizations formed the Indiana Dry Federation to fight the politically powerful liquor interests, with the IASL joining the group a short time later. The Federation and the League vigorously campaigned for statewide prohibition, which the Indiana General Assembly adopted in February 1917. Subsequent legal challenges delayed implementation of statewide prohibition until 1918, when a court ruled in June that Indiana's prohibition law was constitutionally valid.|$|E
25|$|Kepler did {{not have}} a proof of the {{conjecture}}, and the <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> taken by , who proved that the Kepler conjecture is true if the spheres have to be arranged in a regular lattice.|$|E
50|$|The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> {{to round}} E {{to the nearest}} integer.|$|R

25|$|Daimler's and Maybach's <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> {{to install}} the engine in a test bed to prove the {{viability}} of their engine in a vehicle. Their goal was to learn what the engine could do, and not to create a motorcycle; {{it was just that}} the engine prototype was not yet powerful enough for a full size carriage.|$|E
25|$|With the {{technical}} institutions {{of government in}} place, the <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to extend {{the control of the}} Kingdom of Ireland over all of its claimed territory. This took nearly a century, with various English administrations in the process either negotiating or fighting with the independent Irish and Old English lords. The conquest was completed during the reigns of Elizabeth and James I, after several bloody conflicts.|$|E
25|$|The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> {{introduction}} of a new pulp process, thermomechanical pulp (TMP), replacing the former grindstone mechanical pulping. TMP allowed for more long fibers to be retained, thus improving the strength. This allowed for cellulose content to be dropped from fifteen percent, which would allow for cost-savings along with faster processing through the paper machines. The first TMP machine was installed in 1977, with a daily capacity of 120 tonnes.|$|E

25|$|The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> {{to secure}} the cura of a medicus. If the patient was too sick to move one sent for a clinicus, {{who went to the}} clinum or couch of the patient. Of higher status were the chirurgii (which became the English word surgeon), from Greek cheir (hand) and ourgon (work). In {{addition}} were the eye doctor, ocularius, the ear doctor, auricularius, and the doctor of snakebites, the marsus.|$|E
25|$|Boeing Phantom Works {{developed}} the blended wing body (BWB) aircraft concept {{in cooperation with}} the NASA Langley Research Center. In an initial effort to study the flight characteristics of the BWB design, a remote-controlled propeller-driven blended wing body model with a 17ft (5.2 m) wingspan was flown in 1997. The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to fly the 35ft (10.7 m) wide X-48A in 2004, but the program was canceled before manufacturing.|$|E
25|$|The Human Genome Project {{was started}} in 1990 {{with the goal of}} {{sequencing}} and identifying all three billion chemical units in the human genetic instruction set, finding the genetic roots of disease and then developing treatments. It is considered a Mega Project because the human genome has approximately 3.3 billion base-pairs. With the sequence in hand, the <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to identify the genetic variants that increase the risk for common diseases like cancer and diabetes.|$|E

25|$|Munroe {{figured that}} the best way to make pencils was by {{starting}} with a quarter inch slab of cedar wood. He then would cut the slots for his special formula graphite paste and fill them. He would let the paste air dry. The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to glue an eighth inch veneer of wood over the slots. The final step was to saw the slab into pencils. This resulted in a wooden lead graphite pencil that was just under a half inch thick.|$|E
25|$|On March 9, the Legislative Assembly {{passed the}} bill {{by a vote}} of 47 to 18. MPPs from the former Upper Canada voted in favour, 17 to 14, while those of the former Lower Canada voted 30 to 4 in favour. Six days later, the Legislative Council {{approved}} the project 20 to 14. The project having passed both Houses of the Provincial Parliament, the <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> the assent of Governor Elgin, which came 41 days later, on April 25, 1849.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the first}} two decades of the Fringe, each {{performing}} group used its own performing space, or venue. However, by the late 1960s, the concept of sharing a venue became popular, principally {{as a means of}} cutting costs. It soon became common for halls to host up to six or seven different shows per day. The obvious <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to partition a venue into two or more performing spaces; the majority of today's major venues fit into this category.|$|E
