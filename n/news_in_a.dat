5|$|In March 1919, Princess Matoika and Rijndam raced {{each other}} from Saint-Nazaire to Newport <b>News</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{friendly}} competition that received national press coverage in the United States.

5|$|The {{members of}} the office learn that Dunder Mifflin is in {{financial}} trouble. In {{an attempt to get}} the worried staff under control, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Jim call a meeting to provide optimistic viewpoints, despite the steadily worsening <b>news.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> moment of quick thinking, Michael pulls out a murder mystery party game called Belles, Bourbon, and Bullets and forces the rest of the staff to play along. The staff slowly warms up to the game. It is set in Savannah, Georgia, and everyone has to adopt a Southern accent. Thanks to Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), and Phyllis Lapin-Vance (Phyllis Smith), the game becomes a hit. Everyone present starts to play along, except for Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) who tries to get updates on the situation from corporate and Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) who shows up late to work and flees after being told he is a suspect in a murder. Jim, however, believes that the entire exercise is pointless.|$|E

25|$|Photojournalism is a {{particular}} form of photography (the collecting, editing, and presenting of news material for publication or broadcast) that employs images in order to tell a news story. It is now usually understood to refer only to still images, {{but in some cases}} the term also refers to video used in broadcast journalism. Photojournalism is distinguished from other close branches of photography (e.g., documentary photography, social documentary photography, street photography or celebrity photography) by complying with a rigid ethical framework which demands that the work be both honest and impartial whilst telling the story in strictly journalistic terms. Photojournalists create pictures that contribute to the news media, and help communities connect with one other. Photojournalists must be well informed and knowledgeable about events happening right outside their door. They deliver <b>news</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> creative format that is not only informative, but also entertaining.|$|E

This was backed up by the experience of Northern Commercial Company stagecoach drivers, who carried more than $7 million overland during a 12-year period without a single incident.|$|E

Sarah Stegall awarded the episode five points out of five, praising Duchovny's analysis of [...] "bigotry from two angles" [...] {{and his ability to}} tie the [...] "ongoing X-Files conspiracy arc...into a comic tragedy like this". Stegall also called Duchovny's direction [...] "innovative and interesting", and applauded a transition scene, in which the camera apparently moves through a television screen, as [...] "a wonderful visual metaphor for The X-Files itself".|$|E
500|$|After the 1941 season, {{with his}} batting in decline, Oana {{worked as a}} pitcher during a barnstorming tour of Mexico.

[...] Hornsby initially thought that Oana was joking about being a pitcher, but finally relented and allowed him to pitch in relief one day in Houston. [...] In Oana's first 76 innings as a pitcher in 1942, he compiled a 0.76 earned run average (ERA), threw 50 consecutive innings without an earned run, and pitched a no-hitter.

The episode featured {{the conclusion of the}} love triangle between Dwight, Andy and Angela, a subplot that had been going on since the fourth season finale, [...] "Goodbye, Toby". The cast and writing staff saw [...] "The Duel" [...] as a defining episode for Andy Bernard because it demonstrated a softer, more emotional side of the character.

500|$|Peter Keough {{reviewed}} the film for the Boston Phoenix; {{giving it a}} rating of two out of four stars, {{he also said that}} the repeated use of [...] "fuck" [...] grew tiresome. In a critical review for The Observer Philip French wrote that the film had low comedic value, calling it arrogant, puerile and tedious. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film two out of five stars, criticizing its lack of originality. In a review for Empire magazine, David Parkinson also gave the film a rating of two out of five stars and was frustrated that arguments by the director seemed guarded; he said that the film's scope was not comedic, amusing or provoking enough. In Time Out London David Jenkins gave the film one star out of six, writing that it lacked depth on the issues of linguistics, media, and censorship. A critical review by Noah Sanders of The Stranger concluded that the film was watchable and amusing, but poorly edited and organized. The St. Paul Pioneer Press criticized the film's length, which was echoed by The Washington Post, the Deseret News, The Herald and the New York Daily <b>News.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> review for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer Bill White gave the film a grade C, calling it a dull compilation of childish observations and a failed attempt to spark a discussion about freedom of speech. Mike Pinksy of DVD Verdict concluded that the film's main arguments were achieved {{by the beginning of the}} documentary, and criticized its lack of subsequent structure and light tone overall.|$|E
