40|$|The {{behavior}} of a decoupled ideal Fermi gas in a homogeneously expanding three-dimensional volume is investigated, starting from an equilibrium spectrum. In case the gas is massless and/or completely degenerate, the spectrum of the gas can be described by an effective temperature and/or an effective chemical potential, both of which scale down with the volume expansion. In contrast, the spectrum of a decoupled massive and <b>non-degenerate</b> <b>gas</b> {{can only be described}} by an effective temperature if there are strong enough self-interactions such as to maintain an equilibrium distribution. Assuming perpetual equilibration, we study a decoupled gas which is relativistic at decoupling and then is red-shifted until it becomes non-relativistic. We find expressions for the effective temperature and effective chemical potential which allow us to calculate the final spectrum for arbitrary initial conditions. This calculation is enabled by a new expansion of the Fermi-Dirac integral, which is for our purpose superior to the well-known Sommerfeld expansion. We also compute the {{behavior of}} the phase space density under expansion and compare it to the case of real temperature and real chemical potential.

40|$|Charged plasma and Fermi liquid are two {{distinct}} states of electronic matter intrinsic to dilute two-dimensional electron systems at elevated and low temperatures, respectively.

40|$|The general expressions, {{based on}} the Fermi {{distribution}} of the free electrons, are applied for calculation of the kinetic coefficients in donor-doped silicon at arbitrary degree of the degeneracy of electron gas under equilibrium conditions. The classical statistics lead to large errors in estima-tion of the transport parameters for the materials where Fermi level is located high above the conduction band edge unless the effective density of randomly moving electrons is introduced. The obtained results for the diffusion coefficient and drift mobility are discussed together with practical approximations applicable for <b>non-degenerate</b> electron <b>gas</b> and materials with arbitrary degree of degeneracy. In particular, the drift mobility of randomly moving electrons is found {{to depend on the}} degree of degeneracy and can exceed the Hall mobility considerably.

40|$|Path-integral {{methods can}} be used to derive a `path-decomposition expansion' for the {{temperature}} Green function of a magnetized free-electron gas confined by a hard wall. With the help of this expansion the asymptotic behaviour of the profiles for the excess particle density and the electric current density far from the edge is determined for arbitrary values of the magnetic field strength. The asymptotics are found to depend sensitively on the degree of degeneracy. For a <b>non-degenerate</b> electron <b>gas</b> the asymptotic profiles are essentially Gaussian (albeit modulated by a Bessel function), on a length scale that {{is a function of the}} magnetic field strength and the temperature. For a completely degenerate electron gas the asymptotic behaviour is again proportional to a Gaussian, with a scale that is the magnetic length in this case. The prefactors are polynomial and logarithmic functions of the distance from the wall, that depend on the number of filled Landau levels n.

40|$|We derive the {{steady-state}} electron {{distribution function}} for a semiconductor driven far from equilibrium by the inter-band photoexcitation assumed homogeneous over the nanoscale sample. Our analytical treatment {{is based on}} the generalization of a stochastic model known for a driven dissipative granular gas. The generalization is physically realizable in a semiconducting sample where electrons are injected into the conduction band by photoexcitation, and removed through the electron-hole recombination process {{at the bottom of the}} conduction band. Here the kinetics of the electron-electron and the electron-phonon (bath) scattering processes, as also the partitioning of the total energy in the inelastic collisions, are duly parametrized by certain rate constants. Our analytical results give the steady-state-energy distribution of the classical (<b>non-degenerate)</b> electron <b>gas</b> as function of the phonon (bath) temperature and the rates of injection (cw pump) and depletion (recombination). Interestingly, we obtain an accumulation of the electrons at the bottom of the conduction band in the form of a delta-function peak $-$ a non-equilibrium classical analogue of condensation. Our model is specially appropriate to a disordered, indirect band-gap, polar semiconducting sample where energy is the only state label, and the electron-phonon coupling is strong while the recombination rate is slow. A possible mechanism for the dissipative inelastic collisions between the electrons is also suggested. Comment: 4 page...|$|R

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{investigate the}} equation of state and Tan's contact of a non-degenerate three dimensional Bose gas near a broad Feshbach resonance, {{within the framework of}} large-$N$ expansion. Our results agree with the path-integral Monte Carlo simulations in the weak-coupling limit and recover the second-order virial expansion predictions at strong interactions and high temperatures. At resonance, we find that the chemical potential and energy are significantly enhanced by the strong repulsion, while the entropy does not change significantly. With increasing temperature, the two-body contact initially increases and then decreases like $T^{- 1 }$ at large temperature, and therefore exhibits a peak structure at about $ 4 T_{c 0 }$, where $T_{c 0 }$ is the Bose-Einstein condensation temperature of an ideal, non-interacting Bose gas. These results may be experimentally examined with a <b>non-degenerate</b> unitary Bose <b>gas,</b> where the three-body recombination rate is substantially reduced.

40|$|We derive exact general {{relations}} between various observables for N bosons with zero-range interactions, {{in two or}} three dimensions, in an arbitrary external potential. Some of our results are analogous to relations derived previously for two-component fermions, and involve derivatives of the energy with respect to the two-body s-wave scattering length a. Moreover, in the three-dimensional case, where the Efimov effect takes place, the interactions are characterized not only by a, but also by a three-body parameter R_t. We then find additional relations which involve the derivative of the energy with respect R_t. In short, this derivative gives the probability to find three particles close to each other. Although it is evaluated for a totally loss-less model, it remarkably also gives the three-body loss rate always present in experiments (due to three-body recombination to deeply bound diatomic molecules), at least in the limit where the so-called inelasticity parameter eta is small enough. As an application, we obtain, within the zero-range model and to first order in eta, an analytic expression for the three-body loss rate constant for a <b>non-degenerate</b> Bose <b>gas</b> with infinite scattering length.
