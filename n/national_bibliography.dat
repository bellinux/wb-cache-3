Since then meetings, correspondence, and other enquiries have enabled us to assemble precise information and statistics. A brief synthesis on the state-of-the-art was presented orally to the Congress in Montreal in 1982 with the Section’s report on its activities.

40|$|Conference August 16 - 25, 2001 This paper {{presents}} the results of a survey on <b>national</b> <b>bibliographies</b> among the members of the Conference of Directors of National Libraries in 2001. The survey is a follow up of Robert Holley’s study “Results of a ‘Survey on Bibliographic Control and National Bibliography’ ” that was carried out in 1996. All parts of the world are represented by 52 responses. The main findings of this survey are that legal deposit legislation still emphasises textual material but many agencies presently revise their legislation to include more types of material, in particular electronic documents. Furthermore, print remains the preferred format for <b>national</b> <b>bibliographies</b> but more and more agencies are focusing on Internet access. More than half of the agencies are undertaking or planning retrospective conversion programmes.
