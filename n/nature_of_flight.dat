2500|$|Oversight of U.S. Airline Customer Service: May 2, 2017. [...] The Congresswoman posed {{questions}} to the witnesses, including Oscar Munoz,, after the Committee Chairman Bill Shuster left his chair. Napolitano's questions were critical of the airlines' plans to impose self-regulation in response to recent customer service controversies. As the founder and Chair of the Congressional Mental Health Caucus, Napolitano further asked whether the Airlines provide mental health services to their employees because of the stressful <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> attendant jobs and the increasing demands that airline companies put on flight attendants. Mr. William J. McGee, the country’s foremost expert and advocate on consumer rights as the Aviation Consultant for Consumers Union responded that this was “an excellent question because… {{right now we have}} a situation where employees are under tremendous strain because of the executive decisions that are putting flight attendants in the front lines of many of these situations. Flight attendants have a primary responsibility to ensure safety, evacuation, and of course customer service, but we have asked them to be bouncers, and police officers, and all kinds of other things, so {{there is no question that}} there is an issue of training as well.” ...|$|E

I obtained from these MSS. the following summary {{of the differences between}} the domestic breeds of pigeons; that is to say, a notification of the various points in which their organization differs. In the first place, the back of the skull may differ a good deal, and the development of the bones of the face may vary a great deal; the back varies a good deal; the shape of the lower jaw varies; the tongue varies very greatly, not only in correlation to the length and size of the beak, but it seems also to have a kind of independent variation of its own. Then the amount of naked skin round the eyes, and at the base of the beak, may vary enormously; so may the length of the eyelids, the shape of the nostrils, and the length of the neck. I have already noticed the habit of blowing out the gullet, so remarkable in the Pouter, and comparatively so in the others. There are great differences, too, in the size of the female and the male, the shape of the body, the number and width of the processes of the ribs, the development of the ribs, and the size, shape, and development of the breastbone. We may notice, too,--and I mention the fact because it has been disputed by what is assumed to be high authority,--the variation in the number of the sacral vertebrae. The number of these varies from eleven to fourteen, and that without any diminution in the number of the vertebrae of the back or of the tail. Then the number and position of the tail-feathers may vary enormously, and so may the number of the primary and secondary feathers of the wings. Again, the length of the feet and of the beak,--although they have no relation to each other, yet appear to go together,--that is, you have a long beak wherever you have long feet. There are differences also in the periods of the acquirement of the perfect plumage,--the size and shape of the eggs,--the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight,</b> and the powers of flight,--so-called [...] "homing" [...] birds having enormous flying powers; [1] while, on the other hand, the little Tumbler is so called because of its extraordinary faculty of turning head over heels in the air, instead of pursuing a direct course. And, lastly, the dispositions and voices of the birds may vary. Thus the case of the pigeons shows you that there is hardly a single particular,--whether of instinct, or habit, or bony structure, or of plumage,--of either the internal economy or the external shape, in which some variation or change may not take place, which, by selective breeding, may become perpetuated, and form the foundation of, and give rise to, a new race.|$|E

25|$|Both {{echolocation}} {{and flight}} are energetically expensive processes for bats. The <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>flight</b> and echolocation mechanism of bats allows for creation of echolocation pulses with minimal energy use.

The loss of echolocation {{may be due to the}} uncoupling <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> and echolocation in megabats.

5000|$|The <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> in Quetzalcoatlus {{and other}} giant azhdarchids was poorly {{understood}} until serious biomechanical studies {{were conducted in}} the 21st century. One early (1984) experiment by Paul MacCready used practical aerodynamics to test the flight of Quetzalcoatlus. MacCready constructed a model flying machine or ornithopter with a simple computer functioning as an autopilot. The model successfully flew {{with a combination of}} soaring and wing flapping; however, the model was half scale based on a then-current weight estimate of around 80 kg, far lower than more modern estimates of over 200 kg. The method of flight in these pterosaurs depends largely on weight, which has been controversial, and widely differing masses have been favored by different scientists. Some researchers have suggested that these animals employed slow, soaring flight, while others have concluded that their flight was fast and dynamic. In 2010, Donald Henderson argued that the mass of Q. northropi had been underestimated, even the highest estimates, and that it was too massive to have achieved powered flight. He estimated it in his 2010 paper as 540 kg. Henderson argued that it may have been flightless.However, most other flight capability estimates have disagreed with Henderson's research, suggesting instead an animal superbly adapted to long-range, extended flight. In 2010, Mike Habib, a professor of biomechanics at Chatham University, and Mark Witton, a British paleontologist, undertook further investigation into the claims of flightlessness in large pterosaurs. After factoring wingspan, body weight, and aerodynamics, computer modelling led the two researchers to conclude that Q. northropi was capable of flight [...] "up to 80 miles an hour for 7 to 10 days at altitudes of 15,000 feet". Habib further suggested a maximum flight range of 8,000 to 12,000 miles for Q. northropi. Henderson's work was also further criticized by Witton and Habib in another study, who pointed out that although Henderson used excellent mass estimations, they were based on outdated pterosaur models, which caused Henderson's mass estimations to be more than double what Habib used in his estimations, and that anatomical study of Q. northropi and other large pterosaur forelimbs show a higher degree of robustness than would be expected if they were purely quadrupedal. This study proposed that large pterosaurs most likely utilized a short burst of powered flight in order to then transition to thermal soaring.|$|E

40|$|The {{business}} model of low cost carriers is now well-established and {{accounts for a}} large share of western civil aviation, particularly in Europe.

Carriers offer <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> different quality and may sign agreements with suppliers of goods and services at the destination so as to subsidize and foster demand from the carriers' travelers as in standard two-sided markets. Customer-travelers care about home and destination consumption and about the flight's quality. Hence, beyond the thickness of the connected sides of the market, the quality of the airline-platform has an intrinsic value to travelers. We show that only low-income travelers fly with low cost airlines, while no-frills carriers are more likely to act as a platform than legacy airlines. We study how the degree of substitution between home and destination consumption affects the equilibrium market structure of the airline industry...|$|R

Material-Method: In order to investigate their drug use attitude, a questionnaire was given to 408 pilots at GATA Aerospace Medical Center. Drug use attitude, drugs used by pilots and side effects were questioned. Results: 41 % of pilots reported that they used drugs during active flying. But the drug use rate of Army pilots was 57 %, which was higher than the Air Force and Navy pilots. The most common used drugs were analgesics. Conclusion: It is obvious that pilots might use drugs without informing their flight surgeon. Flight surgeons should always educate the pilots about the importance and dangers of self-medication.

This paper investigates how changes in the stochastic variability of flight tracks {{have the potential to}} impact the probability of potential wake encounters. We investigate these relationships for a single runway and for parallel runways. The results show that the mean and standard deviation of separation, and the vertical standard deviation are the key parameters affecting potential wake encounters. In the parallel-runway scenario, effects of crosswind and runway spacing are studied. A full factorial design is conducted to estimate the impact of parameters and their interactions, with dominating factors identified. In some cases, results can be different even for the same parameter when different circulation thresholds are used for defining wakes. Outputs from different wake models (TDAWP vs. D 2 P) are compared. The overall objective is to assess the sensitivity of these results to parameters of the stochastic input distributions.

As technology advances, more and more new instruments are put into the cockpit panel. As these increase, cognitive demands also increase, and pilots are becoming distracted from their primary tasks.

Fast take-off to intercept females and competing males {{is an essential}} behavioral component of the territorial perching behavior in male speckled wood butterflies (Pararge aegeria L.). Females {{on the other hand}} avoid frequent take-offs particularly under suboptimal temperatures, typically showing fewer but longer flights than males. We estimated the heritability of takeoff acceleration performance under suboptimal body temperatures by a restricted maximum-likelihood model. We calculated genetic correlations between this performance and a selection of morphological traits: size (body mass), flight muscle investment (relative thorax mass), and wing shape (forewing aspect ratio). Our results show significant additive genetic variation for mean acceleration performance and a similar but nonsignificant trend (P = 0. 08) for maximal acceleration performance during take-off in males (h(2) = 0. 15). In females, heritability was not significantly different from zero for either of the acceleration performance measures. Morphological traits and take-off performance were genetically linked in a sex-specific way. In males, relative thorax mass and forewing aspect ratio were positively genetically correlated with acceleration performance. In females, there was a negative genetic correlation between acceleration performance and abdomen mass, but not with residual abdomen mass (i. e., regressed on total body mass).

The uniqueness and scientific novelty <b>of</b> data <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> testes is in a complete separation and isolation of vertical and horizontal components <b>of</b> the <b>flight,</b> which enables a fundamentally new way of moving of vehicle in the aerial space. This approach gives a ability to obtain all advantages and to eliminate disadvantages of helicopter and airplane in fundamentally new aircraft by structure and by function – namely in the policopter flyer with additional independent engines of the lateral thrust. Results: Obtained a new experimental data that allowed {{to better understand the}} <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the physical forces, providing the <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> the policopter. Discussion: Revised a physical basis of the airscrew (propeller), namely on the example <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> the policopter proved that most of the thrust of the propeller provided by the mechanical impulse (kinetic energy Е к =mv 2 / 2) by the impulse, that a airscrew receives at his collisions with air molecules,but not by the gradient of air pressure below and above the airscrew. Is put forward a hypothesis <b>of</b> gravitational <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>flight</b> and introduced the notion of "functional antigravity", that a force completely identical in function and opposite on the direction of the force of gravity (gravity force). Deduced a mathematical formula of "functionally antigravitational" transport, namely:G·M·m/R 2 = m I ·v 2 / 2 – for the <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft with a mass m over universal astronomical body with a mass M, and m·g = m I ·v 2 / 2 – for the <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft with mass m over a planet Earth. </em...|$|R
40|$|Measuring {{an arrow}} 2 ̆ 7 s {{ballistic}} performance such as arrow velocity on impact, total time <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> and arrow shaft oscillation is challenging because <b>of</b> the dynamic <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> arrow <b>flight.</b> This challenge becomes increasingly difficult as {{the distance of}} the shot increases. It is also of great interest to bowhunters to understand the ballistic performance of arrows that include hunting broadheads. A miniaturized, sensory data acquisition system, located in the arrow tip and engineered to withstand the high accelerations experienced at launch and impact, enables the precise measurement of arrow ballistics in flight. By continuously recording arrow drag in flight, the system enables measurement of the ballistic performance of an arrow as it travels downrange. The authors have also built an adapter that is connected to the housing of the sensing system to allow for comparative ballistic tests to be performed on hunting broadheads. Here, we present results obtained using the sensing system to perform initial testing on two commercially available broadheads at shot distances of approximately 45 m...|$|R
