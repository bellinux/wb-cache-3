Leviathan is not constituted to fight local insurgencies, but major forces. Leviathan may use extensive swarming at the tactical level, but its dispatch is a strategic decision that may be made unilaterally, or by an established core group such as NATO, ASEAN, or the United Nations.|$|E

500|$|Aboriginal {{groups are}} seeking to {{preserve}} their folkways and languages {{as well as to}} return to, or remain on, their traditional lands. Eco-tourism, sewing and selling carvings, jewelry and music have become viable areas of economic opportunity. However, tourism-based commercial development, such as the creation of Taiwan Aboriginal Culture Park, is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>panacea.</b> Although these create new jobs, aborigines are seldom given management positions. Moreover, some national parks have been built on aboriginal lands against the wishes of the local communities, prompting one Taroko activist to label the Taroko National Park as a form of [...] "environmental colonialism". At times, the creation of national parks has resulted in forced resettlement of the aborigines.|$|E
2500|$|Ireland {{relies on}} {{imported}} fossil fuels for over 80% of its energy. [...] Ireland {{for many years}} in the middle twentieth century limited its dependence on external energy sources by developing its peat bogs, building various hydroelectric projects, including a dam at Ardnacrusha on the River Shannon in 1928, developing offshore gas fields, and diversifying into coal in the 1970s. As gas, peat, and hydroelectric power have been almost fully exploited in Ireland, there is a continuously increasing need for imported fossil fuels at a time of increasing concerns about security of supply and global warming. One solution is to develop alternative energy sources, including wind power and, to a lesser extent, wave power. Wind,however, is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>panacea</b> as it needs to have conventional plants to augment it.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{environmental}} protocols {{have been}} established (see List of international environmental agreements) {{as a type of}} international law, [...] "an intergovernmental document intended as legally binding with a primary stated purpose of preventing or managing human impacts on natural resources." [...] International environmental protocols came to feature in environmental governance after trans-boundary environmental problems became widely perceived in the 1960s. [...] Following the Stockholm Intergovernmental Conference in 1972, creation of international environmental agreements proliferated. Due to the barriers already discussed, environmental protocols are <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>panacea</b> for global commons issues. [...] Often, they are slow to produce the desired effects, tend to the lowest common denominator, and lack monitoring and enforcement. They also take an incremental approach to solutions where sustainable development principles suggest that environmental concerns should be mainstream political issues.|$|E

60|$|You {{may learn}} {{a good deal}} that will {{surprise}} you. You may learn that there are races {{in the world that}} seem born to rule and races that seem born to serve; that democracy is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>panacea</b> for all the ills of mankind, but merely one system of government like another, which hasn't had a long enough trial to make it certain whether it is desirable or not; that freedom generally means the power of the strong to oppress the weak, and that the wise statesman gives men the illusion of it but not the substance--in short, a number of things which must be very disturbing to the equilibrium of a Radical Member of Parliament.|$|E
60|$|The State, {{in spite}} of what Anarchists urge, seems a {{necessary}} institution for certain purposes. Peace and war, tariffs, regulation of sanitary conditions and of the sale of noxious drugs, the preservation of a just system of distribution: these, among others, are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government. Take, for example, the liquor traffic, or the opium traffic in China. If alcohol could be obtained at cost price without taxation, still more if it could be obtained for nothing, as Anarchists presumably desire, can we believe that there would not be a great and disastrous increase of drunkenness? China was brought to the verge of ruin by opium, and every patriotic Chinaman desired to see the traffic in opium restricted. In such matters freedom is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>panacea,</b> and some degree of legal restriction seems imperative for the national health.|$|E

Trade has been touted as an important tool in the path to development by prominent economists.

40|$|Using British {{longitudinal}} data, {{we investigate}} whether individuals enjoy a permanent boost in their job satisfaction by becoming self-employed. We track individuals {{before and after}} transitions from work to self-employment and record changes in their job and domain satisfaction scores. We find that job satisfaction follows a rising trajectory immediately upon transition into self-employment and a declining trajectory in subsequent years, as expectations fail to materialize and the novelty of the new venture wanes down. Thus, our findings confirm that job satisfaction gains are not necessarily permanent, suggesting that self-employment is <b>not</b> always <b>a</b> <b>panacea</b> for job satisfaction...|$|R
50|$|The {{priority}} {{given to}} personal vehicles and notably to the automobile {{led to a}} loss in quality of life, particularly in large cities where smog, traffic congestion, sound pollution and parking became problematic. Acknowledging this, some authorities saw fit to redefine their transport policies. Rapid transit required a heavy investment and presented problems in terms of subterranean spaces that required constant security. For rapid transit, the investment was mainly in underground construction, which made it impossible in some cities (with underground water reserves, archaeological remains, etc.). Metro construction thus was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> universal <b>panacea.</b>|$|R
