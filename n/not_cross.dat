5|$|A 1935 {{article in}} the Montreal Gazette, meanwhile, stated that the {{original}} September Morn had yet {{to go to the}} United States, and that Chabas had sold it directly to Mantashev. According to Chabas, this was after an American approached him to purchase the painting, but was unwilling to pay the asking price. In her memoirs, Vogue editor Edna Woolman Chase recounted how Ortiz had arranged for numerous reproductions to be made and sent to New York, and that– although he had been interested in acquiring the original– he had been unable to do so. Although {{it is possible that the}} original did <b>not</b> <b>cross</b> the Atlantic by 1913, it is clear that reproductions did.|$|E
5|$|Considered the fourth-best {{prospect}} {{in baseball}} by Baseball America {{heading into the}} 1995 season, the Yankees projected Jeter as their starting shortstop. He suffered mild inflammation in his right shoulder in the Arizona Fall League after {{the conclusion of the}} 1994 regular season. As a precaution, the Yankees signed Tony Fernández to a two-year contract. With Fernández the starting shortstop, the Yankees assigned Jeter to Class AAA. During the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, Gene Michael, the Yankees' general manager, offered Jeter the opportunity to work out for the MLB team with replacement players in spring training before the 1995 season. Jeter denied receiving the offer, and did <b>not</b> <b>cross</b> the picket line.|$|E
5|$|Mathilde's orbit is eccentric, {{taking it}} to the outer reaches of the main belt. Nonetheless, the orbit lies entirely between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter; it does <b>not</b> <b>cross</b> the {{planetary}} orbits. It also has one of the slowest rotation periods of the known asteroidsmost asteroids have a rotation period in the range of 224 hours. Because of the slow rotation rate, NEAR Shoemaker was only able to photograph 60% of the asteroid's surface. The slow rate of rotation may be accounted for by a satellite orbiting the asteroid, but a search of the NEAR images revealed none larger than 10km in diameter out to 20 times the radius of Mathilde.|$|E

5|$|Only 5–10% of {{levodopa}} {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier. Much {{of the remainder}} is metabolized to dopamine elsewhere in the body, causing a variety of side effects including nausea, vomiting and orthostatic hypotension. Carbidopa and benserazide are dopa decarboxylase inhibitors which do <b>not</b> <b>cross</b> the blood-brain barrier and inhibit the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, reducing side effects and improving the availability of levodopa for passage into the brain. One of these drugs is usually taken along with levodopa, often combined with levodopa in the same pill.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as the Brady bill loophole, the Brady law loophole, the gun law loophole, or the private sale loophole, the term refers to a perceived gap in laws that address what types of sales and transfers of firearms require records and or background checks, such as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Private-parties are not legally required by federal law to: ask for identification, complete any forms, or keep any sales records, as long as the sale does <b>not</b> <b>cross</b> state lines and does not fall under purview of the National Firearms Act. In addition to federal legislation, firearm laws vary by state.|$|E
5|$|The bloody Wheatfield {{remained}} {{quiet for}} the rest of the battle. But it took a heavy toll on the men who traded possession back-and-forth. The Confederates had fought six brigades against 13 (somewhat smaller) Federal brigades, and of the 20,444 men engaged, about 30% were casualties. Some of the wounded managed to crawl to Plum Run but could <b>not</b> <b>cross</b> it. The river ran red with their blood. As with the Cornfield at Antietam, this small expanse of agricultural ground would be remembered by veterans as a name of unique significance in the history of warfare.|$|E

5|$|The motor {{symptoms}} of PD {{are the result}} of reduced dopamine production in the brain's basal ganglia. Dopamine does <b>not</b> <b>cross</b> the blood-brain barrier, so it cannot be taken as a medicine to boost the brain's depleted levels of dopamine. However a precursor of dopamine, levodopa, can pass through to the brain where it is readily converted to dopamine, and administration of levodopa temporarily diminishes the motor {{symptoms of}} PD. Levodopa has been the most widely used PD treatment for over 40 years.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1971, {{there were}} rising {{tensions}} between India and Pakistan, and after Pakistan declared a national emergency on 23 November, the Indian Navy deployed three s {{in the vicinity of}} Okha, near Karachi, to carry out patrols. As the Pakistani fleet would also be operating in the same waters, the Indian Navy set a demarcation line which ships in their fleet would <b>not</b> <b>cross.</b> Later this deployment proved to be useful for gaining experience in the region's waters. On 3 December, after Pakistan attacked Indian airfields along the border, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 officially began.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1942, Chetnik–Italian {{collaboration}} was routine. Chetnik {{forces were}} included in the Italian planning for Case White, a major Axis anti-Partisan offensive which was to be launched on 20 January 1943. On 3 January, Jevđević participated in an Axis planning conference for Case White in Rome, along with senior German, Italian and NDH commanders. The plans included the 12,000 Chetniks under Jevđević's command, and on 23 February 1943 he concluded an agreement with the Germans that they would <b>not</b> <b>cross</b> the Neretva River and that contact between German and Chetnik troops would be avoided. Early in the operation, Jevđević concluded an agreement for cooperation with the commander of NDH troops in Mostar. Later in the operation Jevđević requested, through the Italians, the assistance of the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen in defending Nevesinje, which faced severe pressure from Partisan forces that had broken through the Chetnik lines at the Battle of the Neretva River. Although the Italians also made this request themselves, the Germans declined, stating that the division was reserved for other tasks.|$|E

5|$|Clemson's post-touchdown kickoff was bobbled by kick {{returner}} Andre Kendrick at the Tech one-yard line, but Kendrick {{broke free}} of the Clemson defense for a 34-yard return to the 35-yard line. Tech's first play after the return was an 11-yard run by Lee Suggs up {{the right side of}} the field. After the first down, Suggs ran straight ahead for a short gain, then Vick scrambled to the Clemson 37-yard line and another first down. Suggs then gained 18 yards on a run to the left side of the field. At the Clemson 19-yard line, Suggs was stopped for a loss of one yard, then Vick was sacked for a loss of five yards. The third-down play was an incomplete pass, and Carter Warley entered the game to attempt a 42-yard field goal. The kick bounced off the field goal crossbar but did <b>not</b> <b>cross</b> it, thus denying the Hokies three points. With 10:33 remaining in the half, Tech still had a 147 lead.|$|E
5|$|Cuts {{in federal}} {{construction}} funds for Metro again delayed construction. Metro announced in December 1982 that {{service on the}} line would <b>not</b> <b>cross</b> the Anacostia River until late 1989 at the earliest. The federal contribution to Metro's construction fund was lowered to $44 million from $95 million for fiscal 1983, and Metro {{said that it would}} divert most of that money to dig tunnels from the Gallery Place Station to the Mount Vernon Square station. In February 1983, the Reagan administration proposed cutting Metro's construction budget by $145 million to $230 million, which Metro said would push the opening of the Green Line to 1991. Metro, {{for the first time in}} its history, formally announced that (absent full construction funding) it could not build the Green Line, the Red Line from Wheaton to Glenmont, or the Yellow Line from Franconia-Springfield to King Street – Old Town.|$|E
5|$|For Walther, at the bridge, the {{position}} appeared defensible {{for as long}} as it would take to remove Ney's force through Winterthur, yet the shock of the Austrian force, as it hit his defences, was sufficient to break his line after 90 minutes of brisk fighting. But there the Austrian forward momentum stalled. Although Hotze's men forced Walther's from the bridge, they themselves could <b>not</b> <b>cross</b> it. From the ridge, Ney's rear guard maintained a steady stream of cannon fire on any of the Austrians who crossed the bridge and attempted to advance up the hill. Hotze recognised the futility of throwing his men into direct cannon fire and ordered instead a steady musketry barrage. This proved effective, for Ney was again injured, this time in his left hand, and his second horse was killed; he relinquished command to Gazan, who organised the continued withdrawal from {{the position}}.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, {{the state}} highway system was {{adjusted}} again, and several new roads {{were added to}} the system, including parts of what would become US410. The Olympic Highway traveled around the Olympic Peninsula and a section from Aberdeen to Olympia was later used as part of US410. The Pacific Highway would later have a brief concurrency with US410 from Olympia to Tacoma, and US410 would later connect to the National Park Highway in Tacoma and follow it to Buckley, where State Road5, now a secondary highway maintained by the counties, began. From the end of State Road5 in Naches, the Inland Empire Highway is concurrent with the future US410 to Dayton, where a branch of the highway travels to Clarkston. State Road5 became the McClellan Pass Highway in 1919 and was aligned further south to Chinook Pass. The McClellan Pass Highway was renamed the Naches Pass Highway in 1921 to reflect the realignment in 1919. Despite the name, the road did <b>not</b> <b>cross</b> Naches Pass, as no highway ever has.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, {{a remnant}} of the {{earliest}} known bridge-like structure in London was discovered alongside Vauxhall Bridge, when shifting currents washed away a layer of silt which had covered it. Dating to between 1550BC and 300BC, it consists of two rows of wooden posts, which it is believed would originally have carried a deck of some kind. It is believed that it did <b>not</b> <b>cross</b> the whole river, but instead connected the south bank to an island, possibly used for burial of the dead. As no mention of this or similar structures in the area is made in Julius Caesar's account of crossing the Thames nor by any other Roman author, it is presumed that the structure had been dismantled or destroyed prior to Caesar's expedition to Britain in 55BC. The posts are still visible at extreme low tides.|$|E
5|$|Mariners {{have a way}} {{to safely}} {{navigate}} around tropical cyclones. They split tropical cyclones in two, based on their direction of motion, and maneuver to avoid the right segment of the cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (the left in the Southern Hemisphere). Sailors term the right side the dangerous semicircle since the heaviest rain and strongest winds and seas were located in this half of the storm, as the cyclone's translation speed and its rotational wind are additive. The other half of the tropical cyclone is called the navigable semicircle since weather conditions are lessened (subtractive) in this portion of the storm (but are still potentially quite hazardous). The rules of thumb for ship travel when a tropical cyclone is in their vicinity are to avoid them if at all possible and do <b>not</b> <b>cross</b> their forecast path (crossing the T). Those traveling through the dangerous semicircle are advised to keep to the true wind on the starboard bow and make as much headway as possible. Ships moving through the navigable semicircle are advised to keep the true wind on the starboard quarter while making as much headway as possible.|$|E
