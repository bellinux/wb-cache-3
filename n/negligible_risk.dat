[...] Alternative materials are available such as steel, copper, and tungsten, but alternatives are universally less effective and/or more expensive. However, the biggest impediment to using {{the vast majority of}} alternatives relates to current laws in the United States pertaining to armor-piercing rounds. Laws and regulations relating to armor-piercing ammunition expressly prohibit the use of brass, bronze, steel, tungsten, and nearly every metallic alternative in any bullet that can be shot by a handgun, which at this time is nearly every caliber smaller than 50BMG (including the popular [...]223 Remington, [...]308 Winchester and [...]30-06 to name just a few). Some lead-based bullets are resistant to fragmentation, offering hunters the ability to clean game animals with <b>negligible</b> <b>risk</b> of including lead fragments in prepared meat. Other bullets are prone to fragmentation and exacerbate the risk of lead ingestion from prepared meat. In practice, use of a non-fragmenting bullet and proper cleaning of the game animal's wound can eliminate the risk of lead ingestion from eating game; however, isolating such practice to experimentally determine its association with blood lead levels in study is difficult. Bismuth is an element used as a lead-replacement for shotgun pellets used in waterfowl hunting although shotshells made from bismuth are nearly ten times the cost of lead.|$|E

RPN for each risk is calculated using traditional FMEA and fuzzy FMEA; their results are compared.

40|$|The Dutch {{approach}} to risk assessment {{is defined in}} the National Plan for Environmental Protection Policy (NMP) of 1988. The goal is {{the present and future}} protection of humans, animals, plants, the ecosystem, and property through measures designed to provide for a sustainable development. The safety goals are defined in "Premises for Risk Management," an annex to the NMP, in 1989. Safety goals are determined with quantitative values. Maximum permitted risks are differentiated from <b>negligible</b> <b>risks.</b> Risks that fall between these two values must be reduced to a negligible level within one generation (ALARA-principle). The safety thresholds for existing and new hazards are also differentiated. Hazards include stationary installations, transport systems (road, rail, water, and air transport), hazardous substances (chemical, radioactive), and genetically-altered organisms. The two most important criteria for risk assessment are the individual probability of death and the probability of death for groups. Although quantitative safety goals have been defined for other criteria such as ecosystems, noise pollution, and odor nuisance, they have little effect in practice. Criteria which are deliberately left out include injured persons, financial-economic damages, damages to plants by radioactivity, and different reductions in activities...|$|R

While some argue that placebo controls can only be used when withholding or delaying an established effective treatment poses no or <b>negligible</b> <b>risks</b> to participants, others hold that the risks should be low or acceptable in light of the social value of the knowledge to be gained from the research.

The concept of methodological reasons is essential to assessing the ethics of placebo controls in these controversial last two cases.

40|$|Bioeconomic {{modeling}} {{was used}} to evaluate traditional and extensive shrimp production in the Mahakam Delta and impacts of adopting Better Management Practices (BMP) for semi-intensive and integrated mangrove-shrimp culture. Modeling outcomes indicate that traditional production is not financially viable, failing to generate a positive 10 -year Internal Rate of Return (IRR). Such practices persist in the Mahakam Delta as capital costs have been depreciated against past financial returns, input costs are <b>negligible,</b> <b>risks</b> are minimal, opportunity costs are low and options to intensify production have been retained by producers. Returns from BMP-guided semi-intensive culture (20 % IRR) are marginally higher compared to extensive culture but entail a 10 -fold increase in operating costs and greater risks. Integrated mangrove-shrimp production gives a reasonable IRR (53 %) but costs remain high, management demanding and risks uncertain. Risk adverse operators with short-term leases may favor traditional and extensive practices. Sustainable intensification, allied to social capital development and rehabilitation of mangrove ecosystem services and environmental flows, is needed to reconcile multiple demands...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{exposure}} and ecotoxicity data of six human pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, clofibric acid, diclofenac, ofloxacin, propranolol, and sulfamethoxazole) were collected, including our own experimental data and literature data. From this data collection, the two-tiered European draft guideline {{on the environmental}} risk assessment of human pharmaceuticals was tested. Measured environmental concentrations in effluents from France and in effluents and surface waters from Germany were compared to the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) in both countries. In a similar manner, predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) derived from acute data and PNECs derived from chronic data were estimated for each pharmaceutical and corresponding PEC/PNEC ratios then were compared in both countries. Globally, results demonstrated that all environmental concentrations (predicted or measured) for each considered pharmaceutical exceeded the 10 -ng/L cutoff value, which requires {{the implementation of the}} second-tier assessment based on ecotoxicity data. Moreover, the six pharmaceuticals showed a relatively limited acute toxicity, and carbamazepine and propranolol were inaccurately identified as having <b>negligible</b> <b>risks</b> under the current European draft procedure.

40|$|The {{population}} of silvereyes Zosterops lateralis chlorocephalus, on Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef has been monitored accurately since 1965. Between 1979 and 1993, the breeding success of all birds {{was determined by}} monitoring nests. The population fluctuated between 225 and 483 individuals. Four cyclones led to substantial mortality. As this data set is long-term, has little observation error, and is from an effectively closed population, it provides an unusual opportunity to examine density dependence in reproduction or mortality. Using a stochastic logistic model, we found clear evidence of density dependence in adult population size. Logistic regression suggested that fledgling survival decreased with the numbers of birds attempting to breed. There was also some suggestion that adult survival might be density dependent. The fitted stochastic logistic model predicts <b>negligible</b> <b>risks</b> of extinction for this population, {{in contrast to the}} predictions of a published population viability analysis. Whilst our statistical model including density dependence may provide better predictions of the "usual" behaviour of a population than a population viability analysis, we suggest that caution should be exercised when statistically fitted models are used to predict the behaviour of the population at extremes, such as near extinction.

40|$|Probabilistic {{techniques}} {{were used to}} characterize dietary exposure of consumers to pesticides found in twelve commodities implicated as having the greatest potential for pesticide residue contamination by a United States-based environmental advocacy group. Estimates of exposures were derived for the ten most frequently detected pesticide residues {{on each of the}} twelve commodities based upon residue findings from the United States Department of Agriculture's Pesticide Data Program. All pesticide exposure estimates were well below established chronic reference doses (RfDs). Only one of the 120 exposure estimates exceeded 1 % of the RfD (methamidophos on bell peppers at 2 % of the RfD), and only seven exposure estimates (5. 8 percent) exceeded 0. 1 % of the RfD. Three quarters of the pesticide/commodity combinations demonstrated exposure estimates below 0. 01 % of the RfD (corresponding to exposures one million times below chronic No Observable Adverse Effect Levels from animal toxicology studies), and 40. 8 % had exposure estimates below 0. 001 % of the RfD. It is concluded that (1) exposures to the most commonly detected pesticides on the twelve commodities pose <b>negligible</b> <b>risks</b> to consumers, (2) substitution of organic forms of the twelve commodities for conventional forms does not result in any appreciable reduction of consumer risks, and (3) the methodology used by the environmental advocacy group to rank commodities with respect to pesticide risks lacks scientific credibility...|$|R
