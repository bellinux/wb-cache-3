Not knowing what to do next, he walked a little distance up the bank, and there, over his head, a beautiful city was floating in the air. He longed to get to it, but how? neither road nor bridge was anywhere to be seen, yet the city drew him upwards, and he felt that here at last was the country which he sought. Suddenly he remembered the golden rod which the mist-veiled queen had given him. With a beating heart he flung it to the ground, wishing with all his might that it should turn into a bridge, and fearing that, after all, this might prove beyond its power. But <b>no,</b> <b>instead</b> of the rod, there stood a golden ladder, leading straight up to the city of the air. He was about to enter the golden gates, when there sprang at him a wondrous beast, whose like he had never seen. 'Out sword from the sheath,' cried the prince, springing back with a cry. And the sword leapt from the scabbard and cut off some of the monster's heads, but others grew again directly, so that the prince, pale with terror, stood where he was, calling for help, and put his sword back in the sheath again.|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of nitric oxide {{was investigated in}} methane diffusion flames under the perturbation of laminar vortices. Laser-induced fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy were used to measure nitric oxide, major species, and temperature, and to obtain the time evolution of the scalar dissipation rate at the stoichiometric surface during the flame/vortex interaction. Vortices with two characteristic times were thrust into the flame and their effects were compared with steady flames at the same scalar dissipation rate. The experimental measurements showed that the vortex did not affect significantly the peak tem-perature, CO, and CO 2 mass fraction during the interaction. <b>NO,</b> <b>instead,</b> was strongly affected. The peak mass fraction of NO in flames under vortex perturbation differed by almost a factor of 2 from steady flames with similar scalar dissipation rates. One-dimensional numerical simulations, used under the well-justified assumption that the vortices induced negligible curvature, yielded results in good agreement with the experimental measurements. The numerical computations were also used to investigate {{the effect of the}} characteristic time of the vortex on the different NO formation paths, that is, thermal, and prompt. The peak mass fraction of thermal NO was shown to be strongly dependent on the timescale of the unsteady perturbation, while prompt NO was almost independent. The emission index, that is, the production of NO normalized by the consumption of the fuel, behaved quasi-steadily for the two formation paths. The results were rationalized by considering the flame structure and the activation energy of the different formation paths...|$|E
40|$|Inflammatory bowel {{diseases}} (IBDs) such as Crohn’s {{disease and}} ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory disorders of the intestinal tract with excessive production of cytokines, adhesion molecules, and reactive oxygen species. Although nitric oxide (NO) {{is reported to}} be involved in the onset and progression of IBDs, it remains controversial as to whether NO is toxic or protective in experimental colitis. We investigated the effects of oral nitrite as a NO donor on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) -induced acute colitis in mice. Mice were fed DSS in their drinking water with or without nitrite for up to 7 days. The severity of colitis was assessed by disease activity index (DAI) observed over the experimental period, as well as by the other parameters, including colon lengths, hematocrit levels, and histological scores at day 7. DSS treatment induced severe colitis by day 7 with exacerbation in DAI and histological scores. We first observed a significant decrease in colonic nitrite levels and increase in colonic TNF-α expression at day 3 after DSS treatment, followed by increased colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and increased colonic expressions of both inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) at day 7. Oral nitrite supplementation to colitis mice reversed colonic nitrite levels and TNF-α expression to that of normal control mice at day 3, resulting in the reduction of MPO activity as well as iNOS and HO- 1 expressions in colonic tissues with clinical and histological improvements at day 7. These results suggest that oral nitrite inhibits inflammatory process of DSS-induced experimental colitis by supplying nitrite-derived <b>NO</b> <b>instead</b> of impaired colonic NOS activity...|$|E

40|$|When workers {{observe a}} {{colleague}} behaving unsafely, they {{are confronted with}} a dilemma: Provide appropriate feedback and risk an argument, or say nothing. •Interpersonal feedback is risky because, in addition to criticizing the problematic behavior, feedback givers may, purposely or otherwise, criticize {{the person who is}} performing the behavior. •This article presents five steps to effective safety feedback that enable a peer to “do the right thing ” without jeopardizing his/ her relationships. Who sees more unsafe behavior on the job, the line manager, the SH&E manager or workers? As one occupational physician says (on condition of anonymity), “The guys on the floor see more violations than all the managers combined. But, they don’t always report them. ” With due respect to managers everywhere, {{it would be hard to}} argue otherwise. Whenever risky behavior occurs on the job, a coworker often is in the best position to see it. Whether it is a power plant engineer without ear protection or a crane operator who is talking on his cell phone or an accountant walking down stairs with his arms full, his/her behavior is most likely to be observed by a colleague. Yet, these observations often fail to result in constructive peer-to-peer feedback and, consequently, in safer behavior. Is this true because employees do not care about safety? Is it because workers do not care about other workers? Is it because they just do not value their own observations? In most cases, the answers are no, no and <b>no.</b> <b>Instead,</b> the most typical answer is that they do not want to start an argument. Unfortunately, for many people, feedback is just as likely to result in unwanted conflict as improved behavior. This lack of communication is unfortunate because without feedback, risky behavior is likely to continue. David Frances, Ph.

40|$|Technology {{used in the}} Swedish {{workplace}} {{is perceived to be}} controlling, gener- ally still difficult to use, and with a low degree of usability. Even though the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has been concerned with researching different ways of developing usable systems for at least half a century, there seem to be problems with the diffusion of the results into practice. One of the possible approaches to developing usable systems is user-centred design, and in this thesis I am concerned with the issue of introducing user-centred design and usability work in public authorities and institutions. I will present work done in two different research projects with a focus on change, where the aim has been to introduce or enhance usability work. Through a lens of social construction- ism and reflexivity I will explore the outcome of the projects and the implica- tions for the introduction of user-centred design in practice. Furthermore, I will explore whether the focus on the introduction of usability work might hinder the formation of a sustainable change in the organizations interested in devel- oping usable systems. The research question then becomes; can we introduce usability work in organizations? The answer to this question is <b>no.</b> <b>Instead,</b> we need to change our perspective from introduction to situated reflexive change: focusing on sensemaking and a situated process of ongoing change, where the stakeholders in the organization themselves must play an active and responsible part. This entails a shift from dualism to duality and a reconsideration of what our usability methods can con- tribute with. Furthermore, I will explore possible approaches to working with situated reflexive change with tools that are familiar in the field of HCI, but with an expanded scope. In particular I will discuss field studies conducted by system developers as a tool for making sense of usability issues, personas as a tool for inducing reflexivity in and on practice, and usability coaching as a sensemaking tool for both organizational stakeholders and researchers in order to understand and reflect upon change.

40|$|The Treaty of Amsterdam {{allows for}} the first time a smaller group of European Union Member States to move ahead on their own towards closer {{integration}} leaving others in their wake. This opens up for a new EU developing at different speeds inside one broad institutional framework. The concept of flexibility was designed to simplify EU decision making as it prepares for enlargement implicitly assuming that it would be even more difficult to reach agreements with 30 countries, than with the current 15. Yet, the final provision on "closer co-operation" turned out a hybrid legal construction, complex in reading and even more difficult to apply in practice. How come the EU crafted an incomprehensible legal tool in order to facilitate EU-business? To shed light on this paradox, my thesis raises two key questions. Firstly, why did the concept of flexibility come into existence and secondly, why did the concept get its complex shape? In the search of plausible answers to the first question, I draw upon two different theoretical frameworks; Multi-Level Governance (MLG) and Liberal intergovernmentalism (LI). The former claims that supranational actors notably the Commission was a key-architect behind flexibility either to enhance its own influence in Community decision making or to guard a shared set of European values and norms. The LI-perspective, on the other hand, suggests that flexibility is a result of efforts of Member States more precisely; a means to accommodate domestically defined preferences. I also apply two distinct theoretical frameworks on my second question; the garbage can-perspective and LI-ideas of rational bargaining theory. The former points to the importance of learning throughout the process of bargaining in other words that the stances of different actors with regards to flexibility were shaped as the 1996 - 97 intergovernmental negotiations proceeded. The latter, on the other hand, claims that the complex legal system of flexibility was a predictable outcome given the multitude of interests and asymmetrical interdependence inside and between the major Member States. From this angle, the flexibility clause reflect a search of all governments involved for the most efficient means of identifying and realising their own stable sets of preferences defined domestically prior to the flexibility process culminating at Amsterdam. With regards to the first question, my empirical findings discredit the MLG-perspective suggesting that the Commission was a key architect behind flexibility. On the contrary, its role came out as extremely cautious and it hesitated as long as it could before it hesitantly gave the concept a modest support. The major reason was that it was in two minds about flexibility; on one hand, it sympathised with those countries that wanted to move ahead faster than the rest, on the other, it did not want to disrupt the Community principle of unity. Accordingly, it stepped aside and left the floor to the Member States. This observation confirms yet again the applicability of liberal intergovernmentalist ideas rather suggesting that the major Community members triggered the emerging claim of institutionalised flexibility. In line with their distinct national preferences, notably Germany, France and Britain started calling for differentiated integration as part of general Community law. Accordingly, the controversial subject appeared on the agenda for the 1996 - 97 IGC. Yet, and also in line with their distinct national preferences, the major Member States claimed very different variants of flexibility. This would prove to affect the outcome strongly as the flexibility process went from agenda setting to decision-shaping stage and the actual clause was being formed. Therefore, and in search for answers to my second major question, I ask whether the complex flexibility clause was the result of a learning process, where the major players modified their position as the negotiations proceeded. My empirical observations indicate that the answer is <b>no.</b> <b>Instead,</b> the complex web of rules in the provision on closer co-operation was a predictable outcome, a lowest common denominator reflecting at the outset conflictual domestically defined preferences. This confirms LI-ideas of rational bargaining theory, developed by Andrew Moravcsik...|$|E
