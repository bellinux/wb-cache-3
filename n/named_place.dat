500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{evidence of}} a human presence {{in what is now}} Oldham is attested by the discovery of Neolithic flint arrow-heads and workings found at Werneth and Besom Hill, implying habitation 7–10,000 years ago. Evidence of later Roman and Celtic activity is confirmed by an ancient Roman road and Bronze Age archaeological relics found at various sites within the town. Placenames of Celtic origin are still to be found in Oldham: Werneth derives from a Celtic personal name identical to the Gaulish vernetum, [...] "alder swamp", and Glodwick {{may be related to the}} modern Welsh clawdd, meaning [...] "dyke" [...] or [...] "ditch". Nearby Chadderton is also pre-Anglo-Saxon in origin, from the Old Welsh cadeir, itself deriving from the Latin cathedra meaning [...] "chair". [...] Although Anglo-Saxons occupied territory around the area centuries earlier, Oldham as a permanent, <b>named</b> <b>place</b> of dwelling is believed to date from 865, when Danish invaders established a settlement called Aldehulme.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we attempt}} to give spatial {{semantics}} to web pages by assigning them <b>place</b> <b>names.</b> The entire assignment task {{is divided into three}} sub-problems, namely <b>place</b> <b>name</b> extraction, <b>place</b> <b>name</b> disambiguation and <b>place</b> <b>name</b> assignment. We propose our approaches to address these sub-problems. In particular, we have modified GATE, a well-known named entity extraction software, to perform <b>place</b> <b>name</b> extraction using a US Census gazetteer. A rule-based <b>place</b> <b>name</b> disambiguation method and a <b>place</b> <b>name</b> assignment method capable of assigning <b>place</b> <b>names</b> to web page segments have also been proposed. We have evaluated our proposed disambiguation and assignment methods on a web page collection referenced by the DLESE metadata collection. The results returned by our methods are compared with manually disambiguated <b>place</b> <b>names</b> and <b>place</b> <b>name</b> assignment. It is shown that our proposed <b>place</b> <b>name</b> disambiguation method works well for geo/geo ambiguities. The preliminary results of our <b>place</b> <b>name</b> assignment method indicate promising results given the existence of geo/non-geo ambiguities among <b>place</b> <b>names...</b>|$|R

However, these cases were very few, and on the whole, the translations resemble each other in most areas.
