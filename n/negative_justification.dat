By employing three different multiplexing ar- chitectures in the network, DTDM permits graceful evolution of the existing circuit switching network into a flexible broadband packet communication network supporting integrated voice, data, and video traffic. The first multiplexing stage uses a packet assembler to multiplex different broadband services into a common DTDM-format serial bit stream. The second multiplexing stage uses a statistical packet mul- tiplexer to concentrate network traffic for more efficient use of trans- mission facilities. A novel architecture for a multiple-input multiple- output statistical packet multiplexer was designed so that the total traffic load of the multiplexer ran be evenly distributed among the output lines and the service priority of each input line can be rearranged dynamically. The third multiplexing stage uSes a synchronous {{time division}} multiplexer for high-speed point-to-point transparent transmission. The multiplexer uses a simple tributary synchronization scheme based on positive and <b>negative</b> block <b>justification,</b> which combines the concept of controlled-slip and bit-stuffing techniques while maintaining information integrity. A generic CMOS LSI chip has been designed {{for use in the}} above three-stage multiplexing system...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the {{variation of the}} number N(t) of spatial critical points of smooth curves (defined as a scalar distance r from a fixed origin O) evolving under curvature-driven flows. In the latter, the speed v {{in the direction of}} the surface normal may only depend on the curvature κ. Under the assumption that only generic saddle-node bifurcations occur, we show that N(t) will decrease if the partial derivative v_κ is positive and increase if it is <b>negative</b> (Theorem 1). <b>Justification</b> for the genericity assumption is provided in Section 5. For surfaces embedded in 3 D, the normal speed v under curvature-driven flows may only depend on the principal curvatures κ, λ. Here we prove the weaker (stochastic) Theorem 2 under the additional assumption that third-order partial derivatives can be approximated by random variables with zero expected value and covariance. Theorem 2 is a generalization of a result by Kuijper and Florack for the heat equation. We formulate a Conjecture for the case when the reference point coincides with the centre of gravity and we motivate the Conjecture by intermediate results and an example. Since models for collisional abrasion are governed by partial differential equations with v_κ,v_λ> 0, our results suggest that the decrease of the number of static equilibrium points is characteristic of some natural processes.

5000|$|Rodolfo Acuña, a Chicano studies professor, regards Sailer's {{statements}} {{on this subject}} as providing [...] "a pretext and a <b>negative</b> <b>justification</b> for discriminating against US Latinos {{in the context of}} US history". Acuña claimed that listing Latinos as non-white gives Sailer and others [...] "the opportunity to divide Latinos into races, thus weakening the group by setting up a scenario where lighter-skinned Mexicans are accepted as Latinos or Hispanics and darker-skinned Latinos are relegated to an underclass". Sailer considers Hispanic a non-racial characterization, identifying non-Hispanic White Americans as second-class citizens because of affirmative action, which he claims has caused and will cause more and more [...] "anti-white pogroms".|$|E
50|$|Most {{forms of}} debate begin from some {{resolution}} or statement of advocacy. As the affirmative plan affirms the resolution in theory {{or at least}} within the sphere of its distinct existence, {{it is reasonable to}} assume that the negative team must advocate the negation of the resolution, usually either through the defense of the status quo or a counterplan distinct from the resolutional advocacy. However, in many circles, the affirmative ability to select their specific plan gives the <b>negative</b> <b>justification</b> to select another topical plan, so long it is 'competitive' with the plan. Advocates of this view, which has become increasingly popular in national circuit high school debate, believe that once the affirmative selects its specific plan so long as it is topical, it abandons any further tie to the resolution and cedes the remaining ground of advocacy to the negative. Moreover, they argue that if topical ground is exclusively affirmative, then the negative could be allowed to attack other potential examples of the resolution that might not be as advantageous as the affirmative plan. This conception is related to the debate paradigm and argumentation theory concept of hypothesis testing.|$|E
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{concerns the}} problem of induction, or rather, two related problems of induction. The first is what I call the negative problem of induction. This is {{the problem of}} rebutting the skeptical argument, first articulated by Hume, which purports to show that inductive inferences cannot in principle result in epistemically justified beliefs. A solution to this problem, i. e., a <b>negative</b> <b>justification</b> of induction, merely shows that the skeptical conclusion can be plausibly denied, specifically, that it is possible that induction results in epistemically justified beliefs. It does not show that this is probable, or that it is reasonable to rely on induction as a source of epistemically justified beliefs. This is the second or positive problem of induction. In this dissertation I develop solutions to both of these problems. In what follows, I briefly summarize each chapter and then say a few words about the philosophical significance of my results. Chapter 1 : The Problem of Induction A successful response to the negative problem of induction must show either (a) that the skeptical argument is invalid, or (b) that it is unsound, i. e., that it relies on some premise that we can plausibly reject. In chapter one I outline the skeptical argument {{in such a way that}} it is bot...|$|E
