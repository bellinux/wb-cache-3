5|$|After {{receiving}} end-of-life care, Brady died of restrictive {{pulmonary disease}} in Ashworth Hospital on 15 May 2017. On 21 September 2017, the inquest {{found that he}} {{died of natural causes}} and his hunger strike had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> contributory factor. Brady had refused food and fluids for more than 48 hours on various occasions, causing him to be fitted with a nasogastric tube, although his inquest noted that his body mass index was not a cause for concern. Brady was cremated on 25 October 2017 and his ashes were disposed of at sea.|$|E
5|$|Another {{contentious}} financial {{issue at}} the time was the protective tariff. While it had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> central point in his campaign, Cleveland's opinion on the tariff was that of most Democrats: that the tariff ought to be reduced. Republicans generally favored a high tariff to protect American industries. American tariffs had been high since the Civil War, and by the 1880s the tariff brought in so much revenue that the government was running a surplus.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} United Kingdom, {{the basic}} {{political}} system in England is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary system. There has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> government of England since 1707, when the Acts of Union 1707, putting into effect {{the terms of the}} Treaty of Union, joined England and Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. Before the union England was ruled by its monarch and the Parliament of England. Today England is governed directly by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, although other countries of the United Kingdom have devolved governments. In the House of Commons which is the lower house of the British Parliament based at the Palace of Westminster, there are 532 Members of Parliament (MPs) for constituencies in England, out of the 650 total.|$|E

5|$|At Beijing, four athletes {{competed for}} the Cook Islands. Of those competitors, three were men (Heather, Okotai, Pera) {{and one was}} a woman (Tapoki). They competed across three sports (track and field, {{swimming}} and weightlifting) and four distinct events (men's 100meters and women's discus throw in track and field, men's 100meters breaststroke in swimming, and men's heavyweight in weightlifting). As of the 2008 Olympics, there had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> Cook Islander who has won a medal at the Olympics.

5|$|Cienfuegos led electors {{that were}} part of the {{imperial}} party in an attempt to elect Giulio Piazza. Piazza was almost elected on May 13, but was short by four votes. The electors were confident that {{they would be able to}} elect him, because more cardinals were arriving to participate in the conclave, and it became public in Rome that Piazza was likely to be the new pope. Albani did not support this because he had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> part of the negotiations despite being the original elector to suggest Piazza, and undermined his election by proposing Vincenzo Orsini as an alternate candidate.|$|E
5|$|Ernest met {{and fell}} in love in mid-1813 with his first cousin, Duchess Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of Prince Frederick William of Solms-Braunfels and widow of Prince Louis of Prussia. The two agreed to wed if Frederica became free to marry. Her {{marriage}} to Frederick William had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> success; her husband, seeing the marriage was beyond hope, agreed to a divorce, but his sudden death in 1814 removed the necessity. Some considered the death too convenient, and suspected the princess of poisoning her husband. Queen Charlotte opposed the marriage: before the princess had married Frederick William, she had jilted Ernest's brother, the Duke of Cambridge, after the engagement was announced.|$|E

5|$|L.A.P.D. {{formed in}} Bakersfield, California, in 1989. The band was started with Richard Morrill, James Shaffer, and Reginald Arvizu. With both guitarist and bass guitar {{positions}} filled, {{there was still}} a need for a lead vocalist, as well as a percussionist. The group asked Pete Capra to join their band. Capra joined the band and was positioned as lead vocalist. Although he had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> vocalist for other bands, Capra introduced the group to bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Faith No More. The group was inspired by the bands that Capra had shown them, and committed to head into those band's genres and style.|$|E
5|$|Matters {{became more}} {{complicated}} in 1954, when the Independent Subway System (IND) started operating D trains on the Culver Line. At the time, the tracks had lettered names (i.e. Track A, Track B, {{all the way}} to Track H from east to west). However, the IND also used lettered designations for its routes (i.e. A, B, {{all the way to}} H as well). The BMT had used numbered route designations up to this point, so this had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> problem. However, the D route was now using the Culver Line, which departed from tracks E and F. To avoid confusion, the tracks were renamed with numbered designations, which they still carry.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 1960, Pollard succeeded Lieutenant General Sir Ragnar Garrett as Chief of the General Staff (CGS), and {{was raised}} to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours promulgated on 2June 1961. Although favoured by Garrett, Pollard's {{succession}} had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> foregone conclusion. The Minister for the Army, John Cramer, attempted to appoint Major General Ivan Dougherty, a retired CMF officer, but the proposal was defeated in cabinet {{on the advice of}} the Minister for Defence, Athol Townley, who feared the antagonism it was likely to engender among the senior ranks of the Regular Army.|$|E

The current municipal master plan calls for the line to be extended to Bekkestua Station, where it would again intersect with the Kolsås Line. One possibility is also that the service be continued along the Kolsås Line and a new branch be built to Sandvika, the municipal center of Bærum. However, an extension has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> priority for the municipal politicians, although the right-of-way has been secured, which will simplify construction.|$|E
5|$|The Independent {{newspaper}} apologised on 21 August 2006, {{writing that}} on 14 June 2006, the paper had wrongly reported Mardas' involvement with Apple Electronics Ltd. They corrected the earlier piece by writing that Mardas had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> company employee, but a director and shareholder of Apple Electronics, {{and was not}} sacked, but resigned his directorship in May 1971, while still retaining his shareholding, until giving it to Apple Corps some years later.

We apologise to Mr. Mardas for these errors".|$|E

The island nation continued to send delegations to the Olympics throughout its era of civil disorder; delegations from the Solomon Islands appeared at all seven Summer Olympic games prior to (and including) the Beijing games of 2008. The first women represented the Solomon Islands at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. The largest delegations from the Solomon Islands included four athletes and appeared in 1988 and 1996.
