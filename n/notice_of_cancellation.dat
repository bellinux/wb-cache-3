2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Sullivan remarked that his program was waning as the decade went on. He {{realized}} that to keep viewers, {{the best and}} brightest in entertainment had to be seen, or else the viewers were going to keep on changing the channel. Along with declining viewership, Ed Sullivan attracted a higher median age for the average viewer (which most sponsors found undesirable) as the seasons went on. These two factors were the reason the show was canceled by CBS as part of a mass cancellation of advertiser-averse programming {{after the end of the}} 1970–1971 season. [...] Because there was no <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancellation,</b> Sullivan's landmark program ended without a proper finale. Sullivan would produce one-off specials for CBS until his death in 1974.|$|E

50|$|The {{withdrawal}} of The Vinelander service in 1993 occurred under controversial circumstances. Two {{days before the}} service {{was scheduled to be}} axed, intending passengers were on the platform at Spencer Street station, ready to board the train to Mildura, when it was announced that it had been cancelled due to a landslide along the track. Despite the very short <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cancellation,</b> buses were conveniently available as an alternative. Suspicions about the supposed landslide story were aroused when it was noted that it hadn't blocked the Melbourne-bound Vinelander that same evening.|$|R

5000|$|The Corner Tap, {{which is}} also locally known as the [...] "Center of the World", is located within the {{downtown}} area of town, {{and has been a}} local staple of the community since it was established. Every year, generally on the last Sunday of the month, the bar hosts a Lawn Mower Poker Run, in which people drive between the town's local bars, starting at the Corner Tap, going north to [...] "The Old Mill", then going back south toward town, stopping at the [...] "Last Resort", then going back into town and stopping at [...] "Mary's One More", the town's American Legion post, and finally ending up back at the Corner Tap. The event would end with a barbecue and tractor pulls. The event draws {{people from all over the}} state and from other neighboring states as well. Despite having been held annually for the last seventeen years, the event was cancelled for 2012 due to the owner's sudden illness and the short <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cancellation</b> did not allow for there to be a [...] "Plan B" [...] to reorganize the event. The event will not continue, with the owner of the bar initially deciding not to continue the tradition, and his recent passing in the summer of 2013. None of the other local bars intend to take control of the event.|$|R

50|$|The <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancellation</b> must {{be clear}} and unequivocal, and made within {{reasonable}} time. Once {{the decision is}} made, it is final. Although conduct may also be indicative of cancellation, the ideal is to communicate it expressly. If an innocent party expressly or tacitly manifests an intention {{to abide by the}} contract in spite the breach, the right to cancel on account of the breach is waived. Waiver and estoppel are two reasonable defences for cancellation. They may be based on past conduct or a previously-spoken or -written waiver of the right to cancel.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the various manners of {{termination}} of an employment relationship according {{to the laws of}} the Czech Republic and compares them with the legal regulation of the same or similar manners of termination of an employment relationship in the laws of the Austrian Republic. The thesis is divided into four main parts. The first part {{deals with the}} system of Austrian employment regulations. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to the concept of termination of an employment relationship in general and it divides the ways of termination of employment relationship into two basic groups; in particular, the first group is termination of employment relationship based on legal acts and the second group is termination of employment relationship based on legal event. Further, the second part of this thesis discusses the terms employer and employee. The third part of this thesis is devoted to individual legal acts based on which in the Austrian and Czech laws an employment relationship can be terminated which is a termination agreement, termination by <b>notice,</b> immediate <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> an employment relationship, respectively exit from employment relationship (in German: Austritt) and dismissal from employment (in German: Entlassung), <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> employment relationship during a [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The {{right to}} cancel a {{confirmed}} agreement {{was introduced by}} the Hire-Purchase Act 1964, mainly to frustrate doorstep salesmen who would take advantage of an unsuspecting person and force them to sign up to an agreement, normally with misrepresentations. In the Consumer Credit Act, the right <b>of</b> <b>cancellation</b> is covered in Section 67, which allows the debtor or hirer the right to cancel an agreement if there were false oral representations made to the debtor by somebody acting for the creditor. The cancellation may be enacted by serving a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> writing given to the creditor or {{an agent of the}} creditor within six days of the agreement being made.|$|R

50|$|The Lisbon Treaty {{does not}} forbid an exiting country to {{withdraw}} its application for leaving, because the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties prescribes an initial notification procedure, {{a kind of}} period of notice. Before a contract under international law as the Lisbon Treaty, which had been agreed without specifying details of giving notice, can be effectively cancelled, it is required that the intention {{to do so is}} expressed 12 months in advance: in this matter there exists the principle of preserving existing agreements and international organisations. In this light, the declaration of the intention to leave would itself be, under EU law, not a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancellation.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{railroad}} dissolved August 1, 1959, and {{the line}} became jointly operated by the PRR and the P&LE at that time, according to documents of the P&LE. The files of the American Short Line Railroad Association suggest that a new Buda diesel prime mover had been purchased to remotor the railroad's Whitcomb, but the Whitcomb itself had been resold to the nearby Jones and Laughlin Steel Company plant leaving the orphaned Buda to sell. This exchange happened in December, 1959, at which point Hiram Milton, later with the County Industrial Development Authority and then the Regional Industrial Development Corporation, was listed as representing the A&SS. EMD SW1 101 was sold to the Pittsburgh and Ohio Valley Railway where it continued its service into the 1990s and possibly later as Pittsburgh and Ohio Valley Railway 5. Interestingly, {{it was part of}} a group of EMD switchers which replaced 65 ton Whitcomb units like its former sibling at the A&SS.
