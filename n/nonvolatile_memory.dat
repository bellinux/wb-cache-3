30|$|In {{the past}} few years, with the {{development}} of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) process techniques [1], Si nanomembranes (SiNMs) have attracted much attention due to their unique properties, such as piezoelectric effect and high speed carrier mobility, and thereof potential applications in flexible electronics [2 – 6]. SiNM-based devices can be built on one or both sides, which are more immune to short-channel effects and have advantages such as faster and lower voltage/power operation and the compatible manufacturing process with current integrated circuit [7 – 11]. As we know, <b>nonvolatile</b> <b>memories</b> are a kind of critical microelectronic devices, among which ferroelectric memories have shown large potential especially in flexible <b>nonvolatile</b> <b>memories</b> based on ferroelectric polymer and oxide [12] or organic [13] semiconductors.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel <b>nonvolatile</b> poly-Si-oxide–nitride–oxide–silicon-type Flash <b>memory</b> that was fabri-cated using hafnium oxide (HfO 2) nanocrystals as the trapping storage layer. The formation of HfO 2 nanocrystals was confirmed using {{a number of}} physical analytical techniques, including ener-gy-dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These newly developed HfO 2 nanocrystal memory cells exhibit very little lateral or vertical stored charge migration after 10 k program/erase (P/E) cycles. According to the temperature-acti-vated Arrhenius model, we estimate that the activation energy lies within the range 2. 1 – 3. 3 eV. These HfO 2 nanocrystal memories exhibit excellent data retention, endurance, and good reliability, even for the cells subjected to 10 k P/E cycles. These features suggest that such cells are very useful for high-density two-bit <b>nonvolatile</b> Flash <b>memory</b> applications.
