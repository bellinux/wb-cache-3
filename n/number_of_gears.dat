5|$|The {{interior}} of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open {{at the same time}} one could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.|$|E
25|$|Internal gearing is {{so called}} {{because all the}} gears {{involved}} are hidden within a wheel hub. Hub gears work using internal planetary, or epicyclic, gearing which alters {{the speed of the}} hub casing and wheel relative to the speed of the drive sprocket. They have just a single chainring and a single rear sprocket, almost always with a straight chain path between the two. Hub gears are available with between 2 and 14 speeds; weight and price tend to increase with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears.</b> All the advertised speeds are available as distinct gear ratios controlled by a single shifter (except for some early 5-speed models which used two shifters). Hub gearing is often used for bicycles intended for city-riding and commuting.|$|E

5000|$|Bicycles {{usually have}} a system for {{selecting}} different gear ratios. There are two main types: derailleur gears and hub gears. The derailleur type is the most common, and the most visible, using sprocket gears. Typically there are several gears available on the rear sprocket assembly, attached to the rear wheel. A few more sprockets are usually added to the front assembly as well. Multiplying the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> sprocket <b>gears</b> in front by the number to the rear gives the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> ratios, often called [...] "speeds".|$|R

This function defines the instantaneous position of the carriers during the braiding process, and can be successfully applied for any Maypole-type braider with an even <b>number</b> <b>of</b> horn <b>gears.</b> Only two parameters must be defined: Nh and rc, which are the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> horn <b>gears</b> and the radius <b>of</b> the horn <b>gears,</b> respectively.|$|R
50|$|A {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) (also known as a single-speed transmission, stepless transmission, pulley transmission, or, in case of motorcycles, a twist-and-go) is an automatic transmission that can change seamlessly through a continuous range <b>of</b> effective <b>gear</b> ratios. This contrasts with other mechanical transmissions that offer a fixed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> ratios. The flexibility of a CVT allows the input shaft to maintain a constant angular velocity.|$|R

5000|$|Besides the {{traditional}} hydraulic automatic transmissions, {{there are also}} other types of automated transmissions, such as a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and semi-automatic transmissions, that free the driver from having to shift gears manually, by using the transmissions computer to change gear, if for example the driver were redlining the engine. Despite superficial similarity to other transmissions, traditional automatic transmissions differ significantly in internal operation and drivers feel from semi-automatics and CVTs. In contrast to conventional automatic transmissions, a CVT uses a belt or other torque transmission scheme to allow an [...] "infinite" [...] <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> ratios instead <b>of</b> a fixed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> ratios. A semi-automatic retains a clutch like a manual transmission, but controls the clutch through electrohydraulic means. The ability to shift gears manually, often via paddle shifters, {{can also be found}} on certain automated transmissions (manumatics such as Tiptronic), semi-automatics (BMW SMG, VW Group DSG), and CVTs (such as Lineartronic).|$|R

Pulleys allow transferring power on distance much easier and with less losses that using <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> wheels.
