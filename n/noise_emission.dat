40|$|The {{characterization}} of the <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> of DC-DC converters at system level is critical to optimize {{the design of the}} detector and define rules for the integration strategy. This paper presents the impedance effects on the <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> of DC-DC converters at system level. Conducted and radiated <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> at the input and at the output from DC-DC converters have been simulated for different types of power network and FEE impedances. System aspects as granularity, stray capacitances of the system and different working conditions of the DC-DC converters are presented too.

50|$|The {{number of}} blades is {{selected}} for aerodynamic efficiency, component costs, and system reliability. <b>Noise</b> <b>emissions</b> {{are affected by the}} location of the blades upwind or downwind of the tower and the speed of the rotor. Given that the <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> from the blades' trailing edges and tips vary by the 5th power of blade speed, a small increase in tip speed can make a large difference.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} problem in most cities – <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> in the {{environment}} caused by transport. It is found that environment noise can cause not only discomfort, {{but it is also}} harmful to health. Therefore, <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> in the environment is topical environmental problem. In this article the vehicle <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> are evaluated, depending on traffic in Trakai city. At selected locations in the northern and southern parts of the city equivalent and maximum noise levels are measured. According to estimates of traffic day, evening and night, using CadnaA program, noise maps are simulated. The noise map will show <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> day, evening and night. Measurement have shown, that maximum noise values was near main roads. In the south of the city, near Gediminas street, equivalent sound level during daytime was 60 dB, evening 54 dB, night – 48 dB. In the north of the city, near Karaimai street equivalent sound lever during daytime was 59 dB, evening – 54 dB, night – 51 dB.

30|$|Traffic <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> by {{transport}} vehicles, such as cars, trains or airplanes {{are one of}} the {{key factors}} restricting {{the quality of life in}} urban areas. Acoustic waves in dynamically moving vehicles arise from many different sources, such as, for example, the noise of engines or the vibrations of the structure due to external excitations like road contact or head wind. The reduction of such <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> is therefore an important factor in the design and the economic success of new products.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Absorption Machines (AM) {{are known}} as low noise devices; thus, they are {{employed}} when silence requirements are very severe as like hotel rooms, hospital rooms, etc. Big size AM <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> may be anyway re-markable. This work deals with an experimental investigation aimed to deter-mine the characteristics of AM <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> on nominal working conditions. Measurements have shown that AM power spectrum is mainly characterized by frequency components equal and higher than 400 Hz. Noise abatement solu-tions have been proposed and discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The renewed {{interest}} in the contra–rotating open rotor (CROR) as a potential highly efficient powerplant for future transport aircraft has prompted a study into the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance {{of this type of}} engine at DLR. With significant technical challenges related to the <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> and installation effects remaining to be addressed prior to realisation of a viable engine of this type, a study of a generic pusher–configuration CROR propulsion system is presented, which focuses on the impact of installation effects on the rotor aerodynamics and <b>noise</b> <b>emissions.</b> The two primary installation effects angle of attack and the pylon wake are studied utilising a high–fidelity coupled analysis based on unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (uRANS) simulations with the CFD solver TAU and the aeroacoustic analysis tool APSIM, both developed at DLR, highlighting the importance of these aspects on CROR in–plane loads and rotor <b>noise</b> <b>emissions...</b>|$|R
40|$|The work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the ship <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> towards the inner part of the vessel and towards the external space.

5000|$|The {{minimization}} of {{the transfer}} function [...] is a great {{step in the process}} of reducing the <b>noise</b> <b>emission.</b> Nevertheless, to be highly efficient, we also have to predict the source levels [...] This will lead us to choose to minimize the Bessel functions for the most significant values of m. For example, if the source level for m=1 is very higher than for m=2, we will not consider the Bessel functions of order 2B-sV.The determination of the source levels is given by the Sears theory,which will not be explicated here.|$|E
5000|$|... noise {{calculation}} is {{the process}} of calculating the level of noise immission using the metric dB(A). Noise immission is created by noise sources (<b>noise</b> <b>emission)</b> of various types which are propagating noise into the environment. A single source will create a certain level of immission primarily driven by originating sound power level and distance influenced by e.g. absorption and reflection. Several noise sources result in typically higher levels of immission. The method or process of determining the resulting immission level is called noise calculation, its graphical representation is called noise map.|$|E
50|$|In February 2006, one {{locomotive}} {{was fitted}} with standard gauge bogies {{for use by}} QR National in New South Wales and Victoria, but the NSW Environment Protection Authority refused permission {{for it to be}} used in that state due to excessive <b>noise</b> <b>emissions.</b> In August 2009 it was converted back to narrow gauge for use in Western Australia. In 2013 three were reclassfied as the 3200 class for use in NSW, following the installation of standard gauge bogies and a modified exhaust system that reduced low frequency <b>noise</b> <b>emissions.</b>|$|R
50|$|The largest {{advantage}} of this building principle is its minimal <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> and the low space requirement. It enables relatively simple integration in many applications.Since the rotor is driven directly by the electro-magnetic forces, no shaft and no gearbox is needed. Sealing of moving parts is not necessary, rotor and stator can be sealed hermetically. Since the blades are mounted to the rotor ring, there is no tip gap. This, together with the gearbox removes prominent sources of noise. Rim-driven thrusters are therefore characterized by an extremely low level of <b>noise</b> <b>emissions.</b>|$|R
