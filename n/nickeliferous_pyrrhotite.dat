Chao (1919-2008). At the type locality in Bavaria chaoite occurs in graphite bearing gneiss that has undergone shock metamorphism. It has also been reported from meteorites including the Goalpara meteorite in Assam, the Dyalpur meteorite in Uttar Pradesh in India and the Popigai impact crater in the Anabarskii massif of Eastern Siberia. Minerals associated with chaoite include: graphite, zircon, rutile, pseudobrookite, magnetite, <b>nickeliferous</b> <b>pyrrhotite</b> and baddeleyite.|$|E

40|$|As {{pyrrhotite}} either dilutes nickel concentrates when recovered or causes significant metals {{loss and}} potential environmental harassments if discarded, production of separate pyrrhotite concentrate was thought as a reasonable alternative; however, processing {{it presents a}} challenge. A new process was studied to upgrade <b>nickeliferous</b> <b>pyrrhotite</b> concentrates using aqueous pressure oxidation under mild conditions, followed by sulfide precipitation and flotation. The effects of operation parameters such as oxygen pressure, temperature, initial acidity, retention time and concentrate composition were investigated. Pyrrhotite {{was found to be}} readily converted into iron oxide. The metal values present in the concentrate, principally nickel and copper, were dissolved in part as pyrrhotite was oxidized, then precipitated from the pulp as sulfides and finally recovered by flotation as a much higher grade concentrate with unreacted sulfide minerals and the produced elemental sulfur together. The pyrrhotite reporting to the leach residue as iron oxide was thus rejected in the flotation tailings...|$|E
40|$|From Chapter 1 : It {{has been}} a long {{standing}} belief that many nickel sulphide ores are derivatives of magmatic processes in ultramafic and mafic rocks, and that they segregate from these magmas as immiscible sulphide droplets which are then concentrated into an orebody by gravitational settling either during intrusion or extrusion, or during the early stages of crystallization of the magma (Naldrett, 1981). Some geologists however, have suggested alternative mechanisms to explain the concentration of nickeliferous sulphides in the mafic and ultramafic hosts. These include hydrothermal replacement (Fleet, 1977), exhalative volcanic processes (Lusk, 1976), or major metamorphic upgrading of low grade, initially magmatic deposits (Barrett et al., 1977). It is not {{the purpose of this study}} to verify or disprove these hypotheses, but in so far as the initial concentration of sulphides in most deposits is concerned, these effects are relatively unimportant (Naldrett, 1981). The nickel sulphide ores associated with these mafic and ultramafic host rocks, invariably consist of <b>nickeliferous</b> <b>pyrrhotite</b> as the dominant phase, together with lesser, but variable, amounts of magnetite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite, cubanite, and platinum group elements (Reynolds, 1982) ...|$|E

40|$|Note: p. 15 missingSince the {{discovery}} of the famous deposits of the Sudbury district, the surrounding area (part of the Temiskaming sub-province of the Canadian shield) has received considerable attention, including systematic and detailed geological mapping, and intensive prospecting throughout the district. In the geology of the area, three different problems are presented. These are: (1) the structural and time relationships of the norite - micropegmatite, the granites of the southern nickel range, the rock of the offsets; (2) the character of the noritend cropegmatite itself; (3) the genesis of the <b>nickeliferous</b> <b>pyrrhotite</b> ore bodies. In this paper the relationship of the norite and the quartz diorite of the Copper Cliff offset will be discussed. It is important to work out both the correct relationships and the age of the quartz diorite because, as all recent workers now agree, the sulfide ore bodies are genetically related to this rock. The quartz diorite is “offset rock”, so called by Coleman, (1903), because many of the dykes seemed to be extensions or offsets from the main norite mass. Evidence favouring the offset rocks as part of the norite has been set forth also by Burrows and Rickaby, (1934), and Collins (1934, P. 169). On the other hand, evidence for regarding the offset rocks as a separate and much later intrusion has been assembled by Yates (1938). Recent studies in the Sudbury area by Cooke, (1946, P. 69), led him to support Yates’ conclusions. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|The {{iron sulfide}} mineral, {{pyrrhotite}} (Fe(1 -x) S), {{has long been}} known to be more difficult to recover by flotation from alkaline slurries than many other base metal sulfide minerals. This paper summarizes the results of an electrochemical study of the surface reactions that occur during the flotation of <b>nickeliferous</b> <b>pyrrhotite</b> in the recovery of nickel and the platinum group metals. Mixed potential measurements conducted with natural pyrrhotite electrodes in various stages of an operating flotation plant showed that the mineral potential is positive to the equilibrium potential of the xanthate/dixanthogen couple. Similar results were obtained during batch flotation experiments and in synthetic solutions in the laboratory. Cyclic voltammetric and potentiostatic current/time transient experiments were used to investigate the oxidation of pyrrhotite under various conditions. In addition, the reduction of oxygen, the reaction of copper ions and the oxidation of xanthate ions at the mineral surface were investigated. The formation of dixanthogen on pyrrhotite surfaces is thermodynamically favourable in plant flotation slurries. However the interaction with xanthate at pH values above 7 is inhibited by a surface species formed during the conditioning prior to xanthate addition. In acidic solutions copper ions react readily with pyrrhotite to form a species, possibly CuS that can be oxidized at potentials above 0. 4 V. At pH 9 this species does not form and there is no electrochemical reaction between pyrrhotite and copper ions. The beneficial effects of copper ions to flotation performance appear to be related to an enhancement of the oxidation of xanthate...|$|E
40|$|Nickeliferous pyrrhotites {{are found}} {{concentrated}} in various grade in the Oshirabetsu gabbro mass which occupies the southeastern piedmont of the Hidaka mountains, Central Axial Zone of Hokkaido. One {{of the most}} characteristic features is that the pyrrhotite is generally accompanied by graphite. The Oshirabetsu gabbro, host rock of the preceding nickel sulfide ores can be classified into several rock facies: a) olivine gabbro, b) norite, c) hornblende gabbro, d) diorite. The <b>nickeliferous</b> <b>pyrrhotite</b> ores {{are closely related to}} the former three rock facies. On the other hand, the nickel sulfide ore is classified into four types: 1) fine-disseminated, 2) coarse-disseminated, 3) semi-massive, 4) massive. The latter two types are structurally controled by fracture or shear zones where abundant quartz, chlorite are generally present and scant garnet and tourmaline are rarely associated. Pyrrhotites and pentlandites from the above-classified sulfide ores were chemically as well as mineralogically investigated, and the following interesting results have been obtained: Almost all pyrrhotite belongs to hexagonal and peak type thermomagnetically. From the microscopic mode of occurrence, the pyrrhotite was classified into lamella type, granular type and spindle type. The value of (1 +x) in chemical formula, FeS 1 +x of Oshirabetsu pyrrhotite {{has been shown to be}} 1. 09 in average, ranging from 1. 04 to 1. 14. Nickel contents in Oshirabetsu pyrrhotite range from 0. 02 to 1. 19, and it has been found that pentlandite is apt to appear in the pyrrhotite which contains around 1 % Ni. On the other hand, Co contents in pentlandite are rather abundant (9. 99 - 12. 31) in semi-massive sulfide ores. Judging from these results, the formation stage of sulfide ores in the Oshirabetsu gabbro can be classified from orthomagmatic to pneumatolytic-hydrothermal phases...|$|E
40|$|The {{non-stoichiometric}} sulfi de mineral pyrrhotite (Fe(1 -x) S), {{common to}} many nickel ore deposits, {{occurs in a}} variety of crystallographic forms, each with subtly differing physical and chemical properties. Since there appears to be little agreement in the literature as to how these varying properties infl uence the reactivity and fl otation performance of pyrrhotite, the manipulation of pyrrhotite fl otation performance is not necessarily simple, especially since there is no uniformity as to whether pyrrhotite is recovered or rejected during fl otation. Using <b>nickeliferous</b> <b>pyrrhotite</b> samples derived from the Nkomati ore in South Africa, Phoenix ore in Botswana and Sudbury ore in Canada, the mineralogy and reactivity of magnetic (Fe 7 S 8), non-magnetic (Fe 9 S 10) and inter grown magnetic and non-magnetic pyrrhotite was characterised and the relationship to fl otation performance developed. Rest potential, cyclic voltammetry and oxygen uptake measurements were used to quantify the reactivity of pyrrhotite and demonstrated that magnetic pyrrhotite was the most reactive, whereas non-magnetic pyrrhotite was relatively unreactive. In some scenarios, the magnetic pyrrhotite was so reactive it was already passivated and appeared to be relatively unreactive. Subsequent microfl otation tests showed that the relatively unreactive non-magnetic pyrrhotite had the best collectorless fl otation recovery and that only with the addition of reagents could differences in the fl otation performance of magnetic and mixed pyrrhotite samples be identifi ed. These differences in pyrrhotite fl otation performance were primarily attributed to the propensity of the different pyrrhotite samples for oxidation and formation of hydrophilic ferric hydroxides. In turn, this was evaluated according to the effect that pyrrhotite crystallography, mineral chemistry and mineral association have in controlling the surface characteristics of pyrrhotite and its subsequent fl otation performance. This study has clearly demonstrated the importance of mineralogy as a tool to understand pyrrhotite fl otation performance which may be utilised for plant optimisation...|$|E
40|$|The main {{structure}} in the map area is a northeasterly trending antiform: the “St David Dome”. The core of this structure consists of Ordovician pelitic metasediments, which are flanked by Silurian metagreywackes and quartz wackes. Three distinct phases of folding have deformed the metasediments in the area. The early or main phase is represented by close to sub-isoclinal cleavage folds, which trend roughly parallel with the St David Dome. The second phase folds trend approximately parallel with the first phase folds, but they are all overturned in a southerly direction and they produce typical crenulations {{in the first phase}} slaty cleavage planes. A conjugate set of chevron-type folds, which trend obliquely to the earlier folds, was produced during the third phase of deformation. Most of the rocks in the map-area have been metamorphosed to some extent. The higher grades of metamorphism postdate the main phase folding and at least continued into the second phase of deformation. The earliest intrusions in the area are Ordovician gabbroic rocks {{in the western part of}} the map area. Other gabbroic rocks, in the southern part of the map area, are possibly of Devonian age. The southeastern part of the map area is occupied by a large Devonian granite mass. A number of adamellite stocks intrude the metasediments along the northern contact of this large igneous body. These small intrusions probably represent a late phase of the granitic intrusions. Moreover it is shown that they are contemporaneous with or postdate the F 3 folding phase. Northwesterly trending wrench faults are very prominent in the map area and the latest movement postdates the granitic intrusions. The volcanism in the eastern part of the map area is related to a narrow block which is delimited by two wrench faults. Stretching of this block by a north-northwesterly tensional stress probably permitted volcanic material to reach the surface and in the final stages of volcanic activity, it provided access for mineralizing fluids. Other tin and some base metal occurrences are related to the adamellite intrusions. In the Rolling-Dam area, arsenopyrite-gold mineralization occurs in fractures which are related to F 3 folds. These fractures occur mostly near the core, but also along the flanks of the St David Dome, which appears to be mostly intruded by adamellite. <b>Nickeliferous</b> <b>pyrrhotite</b> and some pentlandite are associated with some of the gabbroic rocks in the western part of the map area...|$|E
