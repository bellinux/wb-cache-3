5|$|At {{the other}} extreme, {{in the more}} {{developed}} parts of the world, animals are often intensively managed; dairy cows may be kept in zero-grazing conditions with all their forage brought to them; beef cattle may be kept in high density feedlots; pigs may be housed in climate-controlled buildings and <b>never</b> <b>go</b> outdoors; poultry may be reared in barns and kept in cages as laying birds under lighting-controlled conditions. In between these two extremes are semi-intensive, often family run farms where livestock graze outside {{for much of the}} year, silage or hay is made to cover the times of year when the grass stops growing, and fertiliser, feed and other inputs are bought onto the farm from outside.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh {{was the son}} of Gille-Brighde, son of Fergus, king of the Gall-Gaidhil. Donnchadh's ancestry {{cannot be}} traced further; no patronymic is known for Fergus from {{contemporary}} sources, and when Fergus' successors enumerate their ancestors in documents, they <b>never</b> <b>go</b> earlier than he does. The name Gille-Brighde, used by Donnchadh's father (Fergus' son), was also {{the name of the father}} of Somhairle, petty king of Argyll in the third quarter of the 12th century. As the original territory of the Gall-Gaidhil kingdom probably adjoined or included Argyll, Alex Woolf has suggested that Fergus and Somhairle were brothers or cousins.|$|E
5|$|Termite alates only {{leave the}} colony when a nuptial flight takes place. Alate {{males and females}} pair up {{together}} and then land {{in search of a}} suitable place for a colony. A termite king and queen do not mate until they find such a spot. When they do, they excavate a chamber big enough for both, close up the entrance and proceed to mate. After mating, the pair <b>never</b> <b>go</b> outside and spend {{the rest of their lives}} in the nest. Nuptial flight time varies in each species. For example, alates in certain species emerge during the day in summer while others emerge during the winter. The nuptial flight may also begin at dusk, when the alates swarm around areas with lots of lights. The time when nuptial flight begins depends on the environmental conditions, the time of day, moisture, wind speed and precipitation. The number of termites in a colony also varies, with the larger species typically having 100–1,000 individuals. However, some termite colonies, including those with large individuals, can number in the millions.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{the routes}} within the major North Eastern cities, several Chinatown buses have daily routes that run from New York City to Miami.

Most likely, he would have worked even longer if the state had not adopted a mandatory retirement law for government employees over 70.|$|E

25|$|In 1922, {{the novelist}} Evelyn Waugh {{came up to}} Hertford, famously feuding with his history tutor C. R. M. F. Cruttwell (who was to become the fourth {{principal}} of the refounded college, 1930–1939), and later naming a number of odious characters after him. Waugh wrote of his time at Hertford, 'I do no work here and <b>never</b> <b>go</b> to Chapel'. He novelised his time at Oxford in Brideshead Revisited, having his protagonist Charles Ryder at Hertford.|$|E
25|$|Banks offered 40-year {{mortgages}} and, more recently, 50-year mortgages. While {{some observers}} {{suggest that a}} soft landing will occur, others suggest that a crash in prices is probable. Lower home prices will allow low-income families and young people to enter the market; however, {{there is a strong}} perception that house prices <b>never</b> <b>go</b> down. As of August 2008, while new constructions have come virtually to a halt, prices have not had significant movements, neither up nor downwards. The national average price as of late 2008 is 2,095 euros/m2.|$|E
25|$|The Morelands {{have spoken}} to journalists, {{including}} Edward R. Murrow, about family life in a lighthouse that was still, at the time, a half-mile from the nearest land. The Coast Guard supplied them with water, so they no longer needed {{to rely on the}} cistern, although it was still kept full. It was necessary {{to go back to the}} land at least every two days for milk, and they bought groceries every two weeks. The couple could <b>never</b> <b>go</b> out together as one of them had to remain at the lighthouse at all times. During one power outage, Richard Moreland hung an emergency kerosene lamp in the lantern house and rang the fog bell himself.|$|E

25|$|The {{book has}} three parts, each with seven {{chapters}}. Burgess {{has stated that}} the total of 21 chapters was an intentional nod {{to the age of}} 21 being recognised as a milestone in human maturation. The 21st chapter was omitted from the editions published in the United States prior to 1986. In the introduction to the updated American text (these newer editions include the missing 21st chapter), Burgess explains that when he first brought the book to an American publisher, he was told that U.S. audiences would <b>never</b> <b>go</b> for the final chapter, in which Alex sees the error of his ways, decides he has lost all energy for and thrill from violence and resolves to turn his life around (a moment of metanoia).|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} 19 {{harpsichord}} suites and several variation sets. The suites follow {{the standard model}} (Allemande – Sarabande – Courante – Gigue), sometimes excluding a movement and sometimes adding a second sarabande {{or a couple of}} doubles. Like Froberger's, all dances except the gigues employ the French lute style brisé, sarabandes and courantes frequently being variations on the allemande. The gigues employ basic imitative counterpoint but <b>never</b> <b>go</b> as far as the gigue fugues in the chorale fantasias or the fugal writing seen in organ preludes. It may be that the more developed harpsichord writing by Buxtehude simply did not survive: in his writings, Johann Mattheson mentioned a cycle of seven suites by Buxtehude, depicting the nature of planets, but these pieces are lost.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{returned}} to Philadelphia from New York in August 1855 and testified {{in the trial}} of William Still and five dockworkers, charged by her master John Hill Wheeler with assault. They had aided her escape. She testified at length about having planned to gain freedom in the North, and said she chose of her own free will to leave with Still, and would <b>never</b> <b>go</b> back to slavery. She helped win acquittal for Still and three men, and reduced sentences for two others. State and local officials protected her after testimony, and she and her sons soon moved to Boston, where they settled. She married again there. Her son Isaiah Johnson served in the United States Colored Troops during the American Civil War.|$|E

25|$|Roman Catholicism {{has long}} been the main {{religion}} of Spain, and although it no longer has official status by law, in all public schools in Spain students have to choose either a religion or ethics class. Catholicism is the religion most commonly taught, although the teaching of Islam, Judaism, and evangelical Christianity is also recognised in law. According to a June 2016 study by the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research about 70% of Spaniards self-identify as Catholics, 2% other faith, and about 25% identify with no religion. Most Spaniards do not participate regularly in religious services. This same study shows that of the Spaniards who identify themselves as religious, 59% hardly ever or <b>never</b> <b>go</b> to church, 16% go to church some times a year, 9% some time per month and 15% every Sunday or multiple times per week. Recent polls and surveys have revealed that atheists and agnostics comprise anywhere from 20% to 27% of the Spanish population.|$|E

[...] Although Morrison said that the songs on the album [...] "had been hanging around [...] " [...] and according to biographer Steve Turner they were written in Woodstock, musician Ronnie Montrose recalled that Morrison wrote one of the tunes, [...] "You're My Woman", [...] while sitting at the piano during the recording sessions in California.|$|E
