5|$|People {{sometimes}} suspected vampirism when a cadaver did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> as {{they thought}} a normal corpse should when disinterred. Rates of decomposition {{vary depending on}} temperature and soil composition, {{and many of the}} signs are little known. This has led vampire hunters to mistakenly conclude that a dead body had not decomposed at all or, ironically, to interpret signs of decomposition as signs of continued life.|$|E
5|$|The Cattle Dog breed {{standard}} {{states that it}} should have well-conditioned muscles, even when bred for companion or show purposes, and that its appearance should be symmetrical and balanced, with no individual part of the dog exaggerated. It should <b>not</b> <b>look</b> either delicate or cumbersome, as either characteristic limits the agility and endurance that is necessary for a working dog.|$|E
5|$|UEFA Euro 1996 {{was a more}} {{positive}} experience for both Shearer and England. With England not required to qualify as hosts, Shearer had not scored in 12 games in the 21 months prior, and even his overall goalscoring record for England did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> too impressive so far; five goals in 23 games.|$|E

5|$|Aciu Widjaja, now President-Director of Air Asia, {{described}} Chrisye as {{a simple}} man and said that one time, when he, Chrisye, and several others had gone overseas Chrisye {{was the only one}} who did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> for brand-name clothing or world-class restaurants; instead he ate at a food court and bought what he felt was comfortable. In his biography, Chrisye noted that he enjoyed eating at roadside foodstalls well after his marriage and would be perplexed when people stared at him. Guruh recalled that Chrisye would sleep anywhere during extended planning sessions, including under the piano.|$|E
5|$|During the 1937 season, Verity {{played only}} one of the three Tests against the touring New Zealanders. He took two wickets, and {{although}} batsmen found it difficult to score from his bowling, he did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> dangerous and was left out of the remaining Tests in an attempt to strengthen the English bowling attack. He was not selected for the Players and his only other representative cricket was for the North against the South and for teams selected from those who had toured Australia during the English winter. Nevertheless, Verity took 202 wickets at 15.67 which placed him third in the bowling averages.|$|E
5|$|Johansson {{learned some}} Russian {{from a former}} teacher {{on the phone for}} her role of Black Widow in The Avengers (2012), another entry from the MCU. The film {{received}} positive reviews and broke many box office records, becoming the third highest-grossing film both in the United States and worldwide. For her performance, she was nominated for two Teen Choice Awards and three People's Choice Awards. Later that year, Johansson portrayed the actress Janet Leigh in Sacha Gervasi's Hitchcock, a behind-the-scenes drama about the making of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho. Roger Ebert believed that Johansson did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> much like Leigh, but conveyed her spunk, intelligence, and sense of humor.|$|E

5|$|One {{major reason}} for its {{widespread}} success is that the olive baboon is omnivorous. As such {{it is able to}} find nutrition in almost any environment, and it is able to adapt with different foraging tactics. For instance, the olive baboon in grassland goes about finding food differently from one in a forest. The baboon forages on all levels of an environment, above and beneath the ground and in the canopy of forests. Most animals only look for food at one level; an arboreal species such as a lemur does <b>not</b> <b>look</b> for food on the ground. The olive baboon searches as wide an area as it can, and it eats virtually everything it finds.|$|E
5|$|She had {{formerly}} had {{the same}} symptoms of arsenical poison herself, and it was some time before she discovered {{it to be the}} mesmeric work of an enemy. Soon after her marriage her husband began to manifest the same symptoms and had since shown them from time to time; but was, with her help, always able to overcome them. A few weeks ago she observed that he did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> well, and when questioned {{he said that he was}} unable to get the idea of this arsenical poison out of his mind. He had been steadily growing worse ever since, but still had hoped to overcome the trouble until the last. After the death the body had turned black.|$|E

5|$|Shimura mainly {{found her}} characters' names by looking through name dictionaries, {{although}} she also took {{the names of}} acquaintances and slightly changed them, and even used train station names for side characters appearing only once. Out of all the characters, Shimura is most pleased with Kanako Sasa. For the designs of clothes for the female characters, Shimura consulted various fashion magazines for girls in their early teens, especially Nicola. Shimura commented self-deprecatingly in the afterword of volume one that, like her other series, her characters do <b>not</b> <b>look</b> very different from each other, her panels are too white, and there is much pathos.|$|E
5|$|The {{child in}} the man's arms was wearing light-coloured pink pyjamas with a floral pattern and cuffs on the legs, similar to Madeleine's. Tanner {{described}} the man as white, dark-haired, 5ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall, of southern European or Mediterranean appearance, 35–40 years old, wearing gold or beige trousers and a dark jacket, and said he did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> like a tourist. Tanner told the Portuguese police, {{but they did not}} pass the description to the media until 25 May. Madeleine's Fund hired a forensic artist to create an image of the man (left), which was released in October 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight is}} weak-looking and {{resembles that of}} a bat, with {{fluttering}} interspersed with short glides. When feeding, the birds hang with raised wings and patter on the surface with their feet, but, unlike the Wilson's storm petrel, do <b>not</b> <b>look</b> {{as if they are}} walking on the water. Birds will sometimes settle on the sea. Like other petrels, the European storm petrel cannot walk properly on land, but shuffles on its tarsi; once there is enough room, the bird flaps its wings to support itself on its toes.|$|E

5|$|Chimpanzees {{are capable}} of {{actively}} locating objects that {{are the focus of}} another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others. They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view. They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze. Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age. By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses. By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do <b>not</b> <b>look</b> back to the experimenter after looking at the target. Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees. Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.|$|E
5|$|Hector and Tabitha leave. Katy is spooked by the house, {{especially}} when she finds a stuffed cat on the sofa. She sees an old photograph of Hector, Tabitha and Andras as children, but Andras does <b>not</b> <b>look</b> disabled. Katy's friend Shell arrives and plays with Hector's stairlift, sending it upstairs. Katy warns Shell not to break anything, and is startled to see the now-live cat. Katy tries to call her father so she can leave, but the house has no mobile phone signal and the house phone's party line is tied up. As she prepares to leave, the stairlift returns downstairs and Andras's bell rings. Katy is scared of going upstairs, but, at Shell's insistence, the two go to check on him.|$|E
5|$|More than 1,000 {{shots of}} Wolverine have visual effects in them, which {{required}} three effects supervisors and seventeen different companies {{to work on}} the film. The most prominent was Hydraulx, who had also worked in the X-Men trilogy and was responsible for the battle in Three Mile Island and Gambit's powers. Many elements were totally generated through computer-generated imagery, such as the adamantium injection machine, the scene with Gambit's plane and Wolverine tearing through a door with his newly enhanced claws. CG bone claws were also created for some scenes because the props did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> good in close-ups. Extensive usage of matte paintings was also made, with Matte World Digital creating five different mattes for the final scene of the film—a pullback depicting the destroyed Three Mile Island—and Gavin Hood handing company Hatch Productions pictures of favelas as reference for the Africa scenes.|$|E
