5|$|Confederate {{agents in}} Britain had {{arranged}} {{for the construction of}} Confederate ships, most notably the CSS Alabama, which ravaged Union shipping after her construction in 1862. With two more such vessels under construction the following year, supposedly for French interests, Seward pressed Palmerston <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> them to leave port, and, nearly complete, they were seized by British officials in October 1863.|$|E
5|$|The NHL decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> {{all players}} to {{participate}} in 1988, 1992, 1994 and since 2018 because the Winter Olympics typically occur in February, during the league's regular season. To allow participation, the NHL would {{have been forced to}} take a break in its schedule.|$|E
5|$|Wychavon District Council {{refused to}} renew the {{gambling}} machine permit for the service area in 1994, under its policy <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> gambling machines in areas where food was sold to the public. The Kenning Motor Group, who operated the service area at the time went to the High Court to overturn the decision.|$|E

"This love of {{independence}} {{was one of}} the strongest features of her life, and we often playfully told her that her only form of selfishness was the monopoly of saintship,--that she who gave so much was <b>not</b> willing <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> others <b>to</b> give to her; that she who made herself servant of all was <b>not</b> willing <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> others <b>to</b> serve her.|$|R
5|$|As the {{publication}} date neared, difficulties arose. In January 1869, Dallas asked Trollope {{for permission to}} defer serial publication by three months. As Trollope had agreed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> another of his novels to run serially {{during the first six}} months of The Vicars career, the editor's request would have diminished the author's income. Trollope initially refused, but subsequently agreed to a delay of two months, with publication to begin in early July.|$|E
5|$|Brooks {{then took}} a {{petition}} to the General Assembly, asking for a recount. The assembly took up the matter on April 20, 1873 and voted 63 to 9 <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> Brooks to contest the election. This did not deter Brooks, and he applied to the Arkansas Supreme Court for a writ of quo warranto, and was again denied. They also ruled that state courts had no jurisdiction in the matter, and dismissed the case. They gave a lengthy explanation {{as to why the}} General Assembly should decide contested gubernatorial elections in Joint Session, since they are the directly elected representatives of the people.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} {{was one of}} the most-followed races in 2012 and cost approximately $82 million, which made it the most expensive election in Massachusetts history and the second-most expensive in the entire 2012 election cycle, next to that year's presidential election. This was despite the two candidates' having agreed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> outside money to influence the race. Opinion polling indicated a close race for much of the campaign, though Warren opened up a small but consistent lead in the final few weeks. She went on to defeat Brown by over 236,000 votes, 54% to 46%.|$|E

5|$|The government's {{financial}} woes also continued. Hawes {{was embarrassed}} {{to admit that}} neither he nor anyone else seemed to know what became of approximately $45,000 that had been sent from Columbus to Memphis, Tennessee during the Confederate occupation of Kentucky. Another major blow was Davis' 1864 decision <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> Hawes to spend $1 million that had been secretly appropriated in August 1861 to help Kentucky maintain its neutrality. Davis reasoned that the money could not be spent for its intended purpose, since Kentucky had already been admitted to the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|The twins {{had been}} in Ireland before {{travelling}} to England and boarding a coach for London at Liverpool. Their odd behaviour after exiting the coach at a service station on the M6 – including not allowing the bags they were clutching to be searched – caused the driver <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> them back on the coach. The two were later seen on the central reservation of the M6. When Highways Agency Traffic Officers arrived to assist the women, they ran across the busy motorway. Ursula managed to dodge traffic; Sabina was first struck by a SEAT León.|$|E
5|$|While Sundaram is busy {{shooting}} for the climax {{scene of a}} film, his mother falls down the footsteps of her home and is badly wounded. Sundaram's manager Manickam tries to convey the news to Sundaram, but is blocked by the studio authorities who inform him that the director has instructed them <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> anyone in there. After finishing his shot, Sundaram hears of the news about his mother and rushes home to learn that she is dead. At last realising the happiness he enjoyed as a waiter, Sundaram dons his hotel uniform again. He explains to Raghavan that the waiter's job is permanent, while the actor's was only temporary. Raghavan and Radha get married.|$|E

5|$|Another of Dannatt's {{priorities}} was {{tackling the}} perception of the British operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as he was concerned the news media and the British public were unaware of the purpose or the intensity of the missions. Disgruntled by increasingly negative coverage, he interrupted a family holiday in Cornwall to fly to Afghanistan in an effort to change the coverage through a series of interviews. During the visit, he managed to meet with his son, Bertie, who was serving in the country with the Grenadier Guards. Later in 2007, Dannatt raised the same issue in a lecture to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Earlier that year, Dannatt had taken the decision <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> Prince Harry to serve in Iraq. However, after Dannatt had brokered an understanding with the British press, Harry was able to serve in Afghanistan for three months in late 2007 and early 2008 until the story broke and he was ordered home.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his early}} {{resolution}} <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> politics to impede upon his legal career, Maxwell's resolute {{support of the}} Union during the American Civil War, and of the statehood movement for West Virginia, refocused his priorities. Maxwell's political affiliation had been Republican, and he became {{actively involved in the}} formation of the state of West Virginia in 1863. Just weeks prior to the state's creation on June 20 of that year, he began his political career when he was elected to represent the Third Senatorial District in the inaugural session of the West Virginia Senate in June 1863. During his tenure in the senate, which lasted until 1866, Maxwell served as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. In his position as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he played a prominent role in the passage of the state's earliest legislation.|$|E
5|$|Diffie {{has been}} married three times. His first wife was Janise Parker, whom he married while in college. The couple had two children, Parker and Kara, then {{divorced}} in 1986. Parker later worked as Diffie's on-road manager in the mid-2000s, and in mid-2010, he and Kara auditioned for American Idol. Two years after divorcing Janise, Diffie married Debbie Jones, a nurse technician. They had two sons, Drew and Tyler, the latter of whom was born with Down syndrome and nearly died in 1991 following complications from a tonsillectomy. Diffie began an affair with Liz Allison, the widow of NASCAR driver Davey Allison, in 1993. In 1994, a judge ordered Diffie to pay Jones $3,000 per month towards their pending divorce settlement, and <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> Drew and Tyler {{to be in the}} presence of any girlfriend; he divorced Jones in 1996. In 2000, Diffie married the former Theresa Crump, whom he met at a concert, at the Opryland Hotel in Nashville, Tennessee. They have one daughter, Kylie Tarissa, born in 2004.|$|E

5|$|If the High Court {{refuses to}} hear an appeal, the case cannot proceed further; similarly, with one exception, once the High Court has heard a case, no {{decision}} may be reviewed by the Court of Appeal. The one exception is laid out in Section 1(7), and provides that leave to appeal is only valid if either the High Court or Court of Appeal certifies it as such, and the High Court confirms that the case concerns a point of law which merits consideration. In National Westminster Bank Plc v Arthur Young McClelland Moores & Co (No.1), the Court of Appeal confirmed that, once the High Court has decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> an appeal, the registrar of the Court of Appeal cannot intervene and otherwise validate such a request.|$|E
5|$|On March 4, 1969 the FSU {{chapter of}} Students for a Democratic Society, an {{unregistered}} university student organization, sought to use university facilities for meetings. The FSU administration, under President Stanley Marshall, subsequently decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> the SDS {{the use of}} university property and obtained a court injunction to bar the group. The result was a protest and mass arrest at bayonet point of some 58 students in an incident later called the Night of the Bayonets. The university Faculty Senate later criticized the administration's response as provoking as an artificial crisis. Another notable event occurred when FSU students massed in protest of student deaths at Kent State University causing classes to be canceled. Approximately 1000 students marched to the ROTC building where they were confronted by police armed with shotguns and carbines. Joining the all-night vigil, Governor Claude Kirk appeared unexpectedly with a wicker chair and spent hours, with little escort or fanfare, on Landis Green discussing politics with protesting students.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of the {{original}} doctrine of privity {{say that it is}} reasonable <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> third parties to enforce contracts, arguing that to allow them to do so would hamper the rights of {{the original}} parties in relation to amending or terminating contracts. Another argument put forward is that the doctrine was deliberately retained by judges to protect consumers from exclusion clauses designed to protect third party manufacturers from liability. The general view of academics, however, is that no legal argument has yet been advanced as to why the original doctrine should be good law. Patrick Atiyah argues that the doctrine came from a time of rising trade through middlemen, and was designed to simplify commercial transactions and encourage enterprise liability.|$|E

5|$|The Mint {{was willing}} to defer to the Company on the design (Ellsworth withdrew his threat <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> his {{painting}} {{to be used by}} the end of August), but the Company's Finance Committee was unable to reach a decision on what design to use. Warner returned to work on the badges to be worn by the fair's directors at the dedication ceremony in October—the fair itself would not open to the public until May 1893. These badges included a round disk with a portrait of Columbus in high relief based on the Lotto portrait, and when one was displayed it was immediately spoken of as a possible basis for the half dollar. The Company also considered a design with three ships, and another with a single ship and a depiction of the Western Hemisphere, both provided by the Mint. Contemporary accounts also mention a reverse design considered by the Company which depicted a building at the Exposition.|$|E
5|$|Uttanka {{wanted to}} give the sage his gurudakshina. The guru told him to meet his wife Ahalya and inquire as to her wish. Ahalya {{suggested}} that he bring her the divine earrings of Madayanti, King Mitrasaha Saudasa's wife, as gurudakshina. The king had turned into a cannibalistic rakshasa by a curse and was known as Kalmashapada. Uttanka met Kalmashapada, who approached Uttanka to eat him, but Uttanka stopped him and explained that he was duty-bound to get Madayanti's earrings as gurudakshina and that he, Uttanka, would return to Kalmashapada after fulfilling his obligation. Kalmashapada agreed and directed him to his wife, who refused to part with her earrings until Uttanka brought some token from Kalmashapada as proof of his consent. Upon returning from Kalmashapada with a token, Madayanti gave him the earrings. The queen warned Uttanka that her earrings were coveted by Nagas, Yakshas, rakshasas and the gods, who would try to steal them. Uttanka was therefore advised <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> the earrings to touch the ground to prevent the snakes from taking possession of them.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} 40 {{years of the}} tournament, Canada {{did not have a}} {{national}} team, instead choosing to send a club team, typically the Allan Cup winner. In 1960, the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen became the final club team to represent Canada at the Olympics. In 1962, Canada implemented a national team program, led by Father David Bauer. Between 1920 and 1952, seven Olympic ice hockey tournaments were held and Canada won six gold medals and a silver in 1936. The Soviet Union began competing in 1956 and frequently defeated the Canadian team. The Soviets won seven gold medals in nine tournaments; during that period Canada won a silver and two bronze medals. The Olympic Games were originally intended for amateur athletes, so the players of the National Hockey League (NHL) and other professional leagues were not allowed to compete. Many of Canada's top players were professional, so the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) pushed for the ability to use professional and amateur players. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) refused, and Canada withdrew from the 1972 and 1976 Olympics in protest. In 1986, the IOC voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games, starting in 1988. The NHL decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> all players to participate in 1988, 1992 or 1994, because doing so would force the league to halt play during the Olympics. An agreement was reached in 1995 that allowed NHL players to compete in the Olympics, starting with the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan. National teams are co-ordinated by Hockey Canada and players are chosen by the team's management staff.|$|E
