5|$|It {{is thought}} that these plants that have evolved protocarnivorous habits {{typically}} reside in habitats {{where there is a}} significant nutrient deficiency, but not the severe deficiency in nitrogen and phosphorus seen where true carnivorous plants grow. The function of the protocarnivorous habit, however, need not be directly related to lack of nutrient access. Some classic protocarnivorous plants represent convergent evolution in form but not <b>necessarily</b> <b>in</b> function. Plumbago, for example, possesses glandular trichomes on its calyces that structurally resemble the tentacles of Drosera and Drosophyllum. The function of the Plumbago tentacles is, however, disputed. Some contend that their function is to aid in pollination, adhering seeds to visiting pollinators. Others note that on some species (Plumbago auriculata), small, crawling insects have been trapped in the Plumbagos mucilage, which supports the conclusion that these tentacles could have evolved to exclude crawling insects and favor flying pollinators for greater seed dispersal or perhaps for protection against crawling insect predators.|$|E

25|$|As {{defined by}} Hogan and Sternad, “posture” is a nonzero time {{period during which}} bodily {{movement}} is minimal. When a movement is called “discrete,” it means that a new posture is assumed without any other postures interrupting the process. “Rhythmic” movements are those that occur in cycles of similar movements. “Repetitive,” “recurrent,” and “reciprocal” movements feature a certain bodily or joint position that occur {{more than once in}} a period, but not <b>necessarily</b> <b>in</b> a cyclic manner.|$|E

It is common in dogs, especially seen in breeds such as Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, and Shih Tzus. The most common symptom is itching. Affected areas include the underside, the face, the feet, and the ears.|$|E

25|$|Historian William McNeill {{asserts that}} the Antonine Plague and the later Plague of Cyprian (251–ca. 270) were {{outbreaks}} of two different diseases, one of smallpox and one of measles, not <b>necessarily</b> <b>in</b> that order. The severe devastation to the European population from the two plagues may indicate that people had no previous exposure to either disease, which brought immunity to survivors. Other historians believe that both outbreaks involved smallpox. The latter view seems {{more likely to be}} correct given that molecular estimates place the evolution of measles sometime after 500 AD.|$|E

25|$|Debussy {{began work}} on Pelléas in September 1893. He decided to remove four scenes from the play (Act I Scene 1, Act II Scene 4, Act III Scene 1, Act V Scene 1), {{significantly}} reducing {{the role of the}} serving-women to one silent appearance in the last act. He also cut back on the elaborate descriptions that Maeterlinck was fond of. Debussy's method of composition was fairly systematic; he worked on only one act at a time but not <b>necessarily</b> <b>in</b> chronological order. The first scene that he wrote was Act 4 Scene 4, the climactic love scene between Pelléas and Mélisande.|$|E

Controversy over the statues' integrity arose in 2015 after renovations took longer than expected. Representatives of NYC Park Advocates and the Italian-American organization UNICO expressed concern about the statues' condition, although experts said there should be no long-term physical harm. The monuments have since been installed in or around the perimeter of the park, although not <b>necessarily</b> <b>in</b> their previous locations.|$|E
