40|$|Because many common {{foods are}} {{emulsions}} (mayonnaise, coffee creamers, salad dressing, etc.), {{a better understanding}} of lipid oxidation mechanisms in these systems is crucial for the formulation, production, and storage of the relevant consumer products. A research body has focused on the microstructural and oxidative stability of protein-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions that are structurally similar to innovative products that have been recently developed by the food industry (e. g., <b>non-dairy</b> <b>creams,</b> vegetable fat spreads, etc.) This review presents recent findings about the factors that determine the development of lipid oxidation in emulsions where proteins constitute the stabilizing interface. Emphasis is given to “endogenous” factors, such as those of compositional (e. g., protein/lipid phases, pH, presence of transition metals) or processing (e. g., temperature, droplet size) nature. Improved knowledge of the conditions that favor the oxidative protection of protein in emulsions can lead to their optimized use as food ingredients and thereby improve the organoleptic and nutritional value of the related products...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} seven specific dietary phytosterols (PS) (campesterol, β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, brassicasterol, 5 -avenasterol, β-sitostanol and campestanol) in fatty foods. Gas-liquid chromatography procedure was applied to 87 items of Swedish and Dutch origin. In general, β-sitosterol was the dominating phytosterol (60 % represented the median total concentration), followed by campesterol (24 %), stigmasterol (7 %) and 5 -avenasterol (5 %), brassicasterol (3 %), β-sitostanol (1 %) and campestanol (< 0. 1 %). The median total content of PS for the 42 fat spreads and margarines was 204 mg/ 100 g with minimum 73 mg/ 100 g in a low-fat margarine and maximum 775 mg/ 100 g in a polyunsaturated fat spread. Among 19 plant oils, median total PS content was 348 mg/ 100 g, with minimum 39 mg/ 100 g in palm oil and maximum 978 / 100 g in corn oil. Median value for 12 nuts and seeds was 144 mg/ 100 g, with minimum 68 mg/ 100 g in coconut rasps and maximum 404 mg/ 100 g in sesame seeds. Median value for total PS was 100 mg/ 100 g among 14 miscellaneous fatty foods with minimum 11 mg/ 100 g in Dutch <b>non-dairy</b> ice <b>cream</b> and maximum 484 mg/ 100 g in mayonnaise.

In Western countries, soy milk options are widely available for those who avoid dairy products. This adds a distinct flavor and consistency to the drink.Flavorings can be added to bubble tea. Some widely available fruit flavors include strawberry, green apple, passion fruit, mango, lemon, watermelon, grape, lychee, peach, pineapple, cantaloupe, honeydew, banana, avocado, coconut, kiwifruit, and jackfruit. Other popular non-fruit flavors include taro, pudding, chocolate, coffee, mocha, barley, sesame, almond, ginger, lavender, rose, caramel, violet, and Thai tea. Some of the sour fruit flavors are available in bubble tea without milk as the acidity tends to curdle the milk.|$|E

The mixing ratios between hydrogenated PKO and cold-pressed RBO were statistically designed as of 100 : 0, 90 : 10, 80 : 20, 70 : 30, 60 : 40, 50 : 50, 40 : 60, 30 : 70, 20 : 80, 10 : 90 and 0 : 100. The color, absorbanceand viscosity of the mixtures were investigated. As the ratio of cold-pressed RBO increased, the color became darker (L*of 93. 06 to 86. 25) and the absorbance significantly increased, while the viscosity of the mixtures of 20 : 80, 10 : 90 and 0 : 100 (54 cp.) were the highest amongst the ratios tested. The hydrogenated PKO and cold-pressed RBO mixtures were further chemically tested for fatty acids, -oryzanol, -tocopherol, trans-fat contents andantioxidant activity. There were 10 fatty acids present in hydrogenated PKO with saturated fatty acid being the most predominant. Comparatively, there were only 5 fatty acids found in cold-pressed RBO with monounsaturated fatty acid being the major fatty acid. -Oryzanol and -tocopherol contents were higher with increasingcold-pressed RBO from 0 - 100 % (0 to 1, 155. 00 mg/ 100 g oil and 0. 09 to 30. 82 mg/ 100 g oil, respectively). Antioxidant activity was increased with increasing cold-pressed RBO from 0 - 100 % (9. 26 to 94. 24 %).
