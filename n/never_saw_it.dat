25|$|After Walters's innings I {{wrote that}} with one {{necessary}} qualification I {{thought he would}} be come to be rated as the best bat produced by Australia since Neil Harvey proclaimed himself with his famous hundred at Headingley in 48. The reservation concerned his ability against really fast bowling, as to which I had no evidence...Only Lawry and Simpson have made more runs and had records to compare if one is to make a quantitative judgement. Any all events my contention is at least arguable. Doug has made eleven hundreds for Australia, some of extreme brilliance, and if he ever played a dull innings I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

500|$|King told D. X. Ferris that [...] "whenever 'Raining Blood' {{comes in}} the set, it just electrifies the whole crowd. People just shit {{when you hit the}} first few notes. Like 'Jesus Christ it's a guitar, settle down.'" [...] In the past, Slayer used fake blood to cover their bodies when {{performing}} the song live. However, when asked about using fake blood in future performances, King remarked [...] "It's time to move on, but never say never. I know Japan <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> South America and Australia <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> So you never know." ...|$|E

500|$|King {{later said}} that while the idea of playing Reign in Blood in its {{entirety}} was suggested before by their booking agency, it was met with little support. The band ultimately decided they needed to add more excitement to their live shows, and to avoid repetition incorporated the ideas of raining blood. When asked about using fake blood in future performances, King remarked: [...] "It's time to move on, but never say never. I know Japan <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> South America and Australia <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> So you never know." [...] In 2008 the band performed Reign in Blood in its entirety once again, this time in Paris, France, during the third European Unholy Alliance Tour.|$|E
500|$|The {{photography}} for {{the album}} was handled by drummer Shannon Leto, with additional works provided by Ken Schles. The cover art features a teenage boy {{and some of the}} band's symbolism. It includes a phoenix logo, named [...] "Mithra" [...] by the band, that bears the motto [...] "Provehito in Altum". Roughly translated from Latin, the phrase means [...] "Launch forth into the deep". The band chose a phoenix for its association with rebirth and renewal in the Greek mythology. The group expressed interest in signs and symbols and their relationships with cultures and subcultures. The album's cover art was unveiled through the band's official website on July 29, 2002. However, it was not conceived to be the original concept for the artwork. The initial cover art was discontinued and destroyed during production following the September 11 attacks due to the graphic content of the image. It featured a fighter pilot ejecting from an exploding plane. Thirty Seconds to Mars explained that they <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as a violent image, but felt that it was inappropriate {{in the wake of the}} events.|$|E
500|$|Analysts {{labeled the}} team, their season, and their {{championship}} victory {{as the greatest}} or among the greatest {{in the history of}} the sport. College Football News judged the 2005 Longhorns to have played the greatest college football season ever. Sports-writers at College Football News also consider the 2006 Rose Bowl to be the best college football game ever played. Furman Bisher of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said [...] "if there ever has been a greater game, I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> and I've been watching college football games since 1934." [...] Scout.com called it [...] "one of the best national title games ever", while Kevin Hench of Fox Sports called it [...] "perhaps the greatest college football game ever played." [...] ESPN declared the 2006 Rose Bowl Game an instant classic and re-aired it within a week of the original broadcast. ESPN later awarded the 2006 ESPY Award to the Longhorns and Trojans for the 2006 [...] "Best Game" [...] in any sport. Vince Young and Matt Leinart accepted the award on behalf of their teams. ESPN columnist Mark Schlabach ranked the 2005Texas Longhorns as fourth-best among the first tenBCS-era champions.|$|E
5000|$|About {{doing so}} many covers, she stated: [...] "I don't {{like to write}} what I want to say, I like to use other people's words. ... I like to sing {{situations}} that I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> happening. <b>It's</b> a way of living other things".|$|R

500|$|Pamela and Bobby's {{relationship}} {{changed significantly}} {{as the show}} went on and began to progress. In order to create conflict, the producers brought in actors Priscilla Presley (Jenna Wade) and John Beck (Mark Graison) to cause drama for the couple. Eventually, the two characters divorced one another and went their separate ways. After becoming involved with Ewing oil, Bobby tended to put Pam on the backburner with the company coming first. In an interview with People, Principal said: [...] "I wouldn't {{put up with the}} way Pam is treated by Bobby." [...] She also added, [...] "Our marriage just doesn't work anymore and I want a divorce." [...] With the impending couple doomed, Pamela began a newfound relationship with Mark Graison (played by John Beck). The producers of Dallas were faced with the obstacle of getting the audience to root for a new love interest in Pam's life. When asked about the reception of his characters relationship with Pamela, Beck commented: [...] "It was always set up that way from the beginning, so it was quite a task and of course they came back together in the long run. I was just hoping for the best. I never got an extraordinary reaction from the public but it was everywhere, so constant recognition. It was pretty amazing but I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> the way he sees it but I can see his point of view. I never really looked at it like that." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's cover art (known as the 'Screaming Elf') is a {{distorted}} {{photograph of the}} band members, photographed by Kevin Westenberg, above {{a black and white}} upside-down burning forest. Concerning the artwork, Cornell said, [...] "Superunknown relates to birth in a way... Being born or even dying—getting flushed into something that you know nothing about. The hardest thing is to nail down a visual image to put on a title like that. The first thing we thought of was a forest in grey or black. Soundgarden has always been associated with images of flowers and lush colors and this was the opposite. It still seemed organic but it was very dark and cold... I was into those stories as a kid where forests were full of evil and scary things as opposed to being happy gardens that you go camping in." [...] In a 1994 Pulse! magazine interview, Cornell said that the inspiration for the album's title came from his misreading of a video entitled Superclown. He added, [...] "I thought it was a cool title. I'd never heard it before, <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> before, and it inspired me." [...] The album also saw a limited release on 12" [...] colored vinyl (blue, orange, and clear), as a double-LP in a gatefold sleeve. The album's title 'SUPERUNKNOWN' is sometimes displayed with the [...] "UNKNOWN" [...] as semi upside down and reversed lettering (stylized as [...] "SUPER∩ИKИOWИ").|$|E

[...] The episode has been shown on Game Show Network although Armstrong himself <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> until his biographer brought him a copy of the tape.|$|E

2500|$|In 1928, Ranetti {{was working}} on a {{collected}} works edition, also at Cartea Românească, but <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> through. He died on May 2, 1928, in Bucharest, and was buried at Bellu cemetery, Plot 98. Days later, eulogies appeared in Gândirea, Țara Noastră, and Viitorul, followed by a retrospective article in Universul Literar and, in later years, by Tudor Arghezi and D. I. Suchianu's essays on Ranetti. Furnica survived under Țăranu's management, but became in 1930 a supplement of the daily Vremea. In 1940, Ranetti was dedicated a special issue of Ștefan Baciu's Veselia. He was survived until 1932 by his common-law wife, Cleopatra [...] "Cleo" [...] Iamandi, and, until 1947, by his brother Atanase. The latter also contributed a dedication on George's grave, and was eventually buried next to him.|$|E
2500|$|Guadagnino has {{described}} Call Me By Your Name as a family-oriented film {{for the purpose}} of [...] "transmission of knowledge and hope that people of different generations come to see the film together." [...] He <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as a [...] "gay" [...] movie, but rather calls it a film about the [...] "beauty of the newborn idea of desire, unbiased and uncynical," [...] and reflects his motto of living [...] "with a sense of joie de vivre." [...] The director attempted to avoid the flaws he had seen in most coming-of-age films, in which growth is often portrayed as a result of resolving certain preconceived dilemmas, like choosing between two lovers. He also wanted the story to follow two people in the moment, rather than focus on an antagonist or a tragedy, a specific approach inspired by À Nos Amours (1983), directed by Maurice Pialat. As someone who considers sex in film a representation of the characters' behavior and identity, Guadagnino wasn't interested in including explicit sex scenes in the film, {{in order to keep the}} tone as planned, saying, [...] "I wanted the audience to completely rely on the emotional travel of these people and feel first love [...] It was important to me to create this powerful universality, because the whole idea of the movie is that the other person makes you beautiful — enlightens you, elevates you." ...|$|E
