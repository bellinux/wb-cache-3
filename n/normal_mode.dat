5|$|Another {{interviewer}} further {{asked of}} the developers of the removals of other features from previous {{entries in the}} series, including dual screen play, leveling up, Survival mode, Combat mode, and Hard mode. The dual-screen play was removed, with the developers commenting that while {{it could have been}} implemented, it did not need to be, and the full use of the dual screens for viewing intel on units and terrain allowed the gameplay to proceed more seamlessly. The ability to level up players' Commanding Officers was introduced in Days of Ruins predecessor, , the developers commenting that the gameplay centered around how well players used their commanding officer. This mechanic was replaced by the ability to level up individual units, commenting that this mechanic required players to work strategically with how they deploy their units. The Survival and Combat modes were removed due to not fitting with the redesign of the world, preferring to have a more focused game. Finally, Hard mode was removed due to the developers feeling that the <b>Normal</b> <b>mode</b> was designed {{in such a way that}} a widespread audience could enjoy it. They also commented that earning a high ranking in this mode by doing a good job was effectively the same as Hard mode.|$|E

25|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} important or fundamental IR bands arise from the excitations of normal modes, the simplest distortions of the molecule, from the ground state with vibrational quantum number v = 0 to the first excited state with vibrational quantum number v = 1. In some cases, overtone bands are observed. An overtone band arises from the absorption of a photon leading to a direct transition from the ground state to the second excited vibrational state (v = 2). Such a band appears at approximately twice {{the energy of the}} fundamental band for the same <b>normal</b> <b>mode.</b> Some excitations, so-called combination modes, involve simultaneous excitation of more than one <b>normal</b> <b>mode.</b> The phenomenon of Fermi resonance can arise when two modes are similar in energy; Fermi resonance results in an unexpected shift in energy and intensity of the bands etc.|$|E

The standard method involves calculating <b>normal</b> <b>modes</b> with the GF matrix technique. <b>Normal</b> <b>modes</b> assume a harmonic potential and. in fact, in high energy systems local anharmonic modes {{have given a}} better description of the spectrum than (harmonic) <b>normal</b> <b>modes</b> of the molecules as a whole...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we look at}} the {{symmetry}} of <b>normal</b> <b>modes</b> in symmetric structures, particularly structures with cyclic symmetry. We show that <b>normal</b> <b>modes</b> of symmetric structures have different levels of symmetry, or symmetricity. One novel theoretical result of this work is that, for a ring structure with $m$ subunits, the symmetricity of the <b>normal</b> <b>modes</b> falls into $m$ groups of equal size, with <b>normal</b> <b>modes</b> in each group having the same symmetricity. The <b>normal</b> <b>modes</b> in each group can be computed separately, using a much smaller amount of memory and time (up to $m^ 3 $ less), thus making it applicable to larger complexes. We show that <b>normal</b> <b>modes</b> with perfect symmetry or anti-symmetry have no degeneracy {{while the rest of the}} modes have a degeneracy of two. We show also how symmetry in <b>normal</b> <b>modes</b> correlates with symmetry in structure. While a broken symmetry in structure generally leads to a loss of symmetricity in symmetric <b>normal</b> <b>modes,</b> the symmetricity of some symmetric <b>normal</b> <b>modes</b> is preserved even when symmetry in structure is broken. This work suggests a deeper reason for the existence of symmetric complexes: that they may be formed not only for structural purpose, but likely also for a dynamical reason, that certain symmetry is needed by a given complex to obtain certain symmetric motions that are functionally critical...|$|R
25|$|A {{commonly}} cited counter-example where {{energy is}} not shared among its various forms and where equipartition {{does not hold}} in the microcanonical ensemble is a system of coupled harmonic oscillators. If the system is isolated {{from the rest of}} the world, the energy in each <b>normal</b> <b>mode</b> is constant; energy is not transferred from one mode to another. Hence, equipartition does not hold for such a system; the amount of energy in each <b>normal</b> <b>mode</b> is fixed at its initial value. If sufficiently strong nonlinear terms are present in the energy function, energy may be transferred between the normal modes, leading to ergodicity and rendering the law of equipartition valid. However, the Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem states that energy will not be exchanged unless the nonlinear perturbations are strong enough; if they are too small, the energy will remain trapped in at least some of the modes.|$|E
25|$|A phonon is {{a quantum}} {{mechanical}} description of an elementary vibrational motion {{in which a}} lattice of atoms or molecules uniformly oscillates at a single frequency. In classical mechanics this designates a <b>normal</b> <b>mode</b> of vibration. Normal modes are important because any arbitrary lattice vibration can {{be considered to be}} a superposition of these elementary vibration modes (cf. Fourier analysis). While normal modes are wave-like phenomena in classical mechanics, phonons have particle-like properties too, in a way related to the wave–particle duality of quantum mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Although EcM fungal hyphae {{form the}} Hartig net outside of root cells, {{penetration}} of plant cortical cells occasionally occurs. Many species of ectomycorrhizal fungi {{are capable of}} forming mycorrhizas with other plant species where this penetration is the <b>normal</b> <b>mode</b> of mycorrhizal formation. These associations represent a form of symbiosis intermediate to arbuscular mycorrhizas and ectomycorrhizas, termed ectendomycorrhizas. Like EcM fungi, both the mantle and Hartig net are present, though sometimes at reduced density. However, more like AM fungi, the hyphae penetrate the host’s root intracellularly. Thus, the same species of fungi can be categorized as ecto- or ectendomycorrhizas depending on the host species.|$|E

The application considered in this study is the airframe of the Morane–Saulnier Paris aircraft. Ground vibration tests of this aircraft exhibited softening nonlinearities in the connection between the external fuel tanks and the wing tips. The nonlinear <b>normal</b> <b>modes</b> of this aircraft are computed from a reduced-order nonlinear finite element model using a numerical algorithm combining shooting and pseudo-arclength continuation. Several nonlinear <b>normal</b> <b>modes,</b> involving, e. g., wing bending, wing torsion, and tail bending, are presented, which highlights that the aircraft can exhibit very interesting nonlinear phenomena. Specifically, it is shown that modes with distinct linear frequencies can interact and generate additional nonlinear modes with no linear counterpart...|$|R

25|$|The {{behavior}} {{of this system}} can be understood by looking at its normal modes of oscillation. If the two pendulums are identical then one <b>normal</b> <b>mode</b> consists of both pendulums swinging {{in the same direction}} with a constant distance between them, while the other consists of the pendulums swinging in opposite (mirror image) directions. These normal modes have (slightly) different frequencies because the second involves the (weak) spring while the first does not. The initial state of the two-pendulum system is a combination of both normal modes. Over time, these normal modes drift out of phase, and this is seen as a transfer of motion from the first pendulum to the second.|$|E

The higher resonance modes are spaced at approximately 6.5Hz intervals, a characteristic attributed to the atmosphere's spherical geometry.

25|$|As {{the launch}} {{customer}} of extended Q400, SAS {{was prone to}} many of the early faults with the aircraft type. Aviation historian Åke Hall stated that it was the aircraft type which SAS has had the most challenges with throughout its history.

One issue was false alarms created by the cockpit software, while oil leaks caused for engines to have to be replaced. By October there had been nine emergency landings caused by various technical faults, and SAS Commuter chose to ground the aircraft for several days. Deliveries came to a halt that month as the eleven first aircraft were all having faults caused by the same defects. Delivery of further aircraft resumed in February 2001.
