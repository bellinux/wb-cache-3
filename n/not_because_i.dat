5|$|I will confess {{up front}} that I love Anonymous, but <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> think they're the heroes. Like Alan Moore's {{character}} V who inspired Anonymous {{to adopt the}} Guy Fawkes mask as an icon and fashion item, you're never quite sure if Anonymous is the hero or antihero. The trickster is attracted to change {{and the need for}} change, and that's where Anonymous goes. But they are not your personal army – that's Rule 44 – yes, there are rules. And when they do something, it never goes quite as planned. The internet has no neat endings.|$|E

500|$|Callicrates: Considered the [...] "most {{beautiful}} man, {{not among}} the Spartans only, but in the whole Greek camp", Callicrates was eager to distinguish himself that day as a warrior but was deprived of the chance by a stray arrow that pierced his side while standing in formation. When the battle commenced he insisted on making the charge with the rest, but collapsed within a short distance. His last words, according to Herodotus, were, [...] "I grieve <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have to die for my country, but because I have not lifted my arm against the enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|Röhrl {{inherited}} the win {{and became the}} first two-time world champion in rallying. Having lost her father, Mouton did not dwell on losing the title. Röhrl had earlier conceded that he [...] "would have accepted second place in the championship to Mikkola", but not to Mouton: [...] "This is <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> doubt her capabilities as a driver, but because she is a woman." [...] He believed that defeat would have devalued his performances. At the RAC, Mouton edged out Toivonen to take second place behind Mikkola. This result made Audi the first German marque to win the manufacturers' world title. At the inaugural Autosport Awards gala, Mouton won the International Rally Driver of the Year award.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{featured}} several elaborate CGI scenes. The {{first scene}} with the vertebrae was entirely computer generated by visual effects head John Wash. Alex Krycek {{was killed by a}} CGI bullet straight through the head, which again was Manners' idea. Extra money was budgeted for Krycek's death. Mitch Pileggi was very happy when he was told he would be killing Krycek; he explained, [...] "when they came to me and told me that I was the one that was going to kill Krycek, I was elated. <b>Not</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> wanted Nick to go away or anything, it was just from a character stand-point; Skinner just wanted to kill Krycek so bad."

500|$|A New York Times {{article by}} Peter De Jonge {{explained}} that [...] "The West Wing is never plotted {{out for more}} than a few weeks ahead and has no major story lines", which De Jonge believed was because [...] "with characters who have no flaws, it is impossible to give them significant arcs". Sorkin has stated: [...] "I seldom plan ahead, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't think it's good to plan ahead, there just isn't time." [...] Sorkin has also said, [...] "As a writer, I don't like to answer questions until the very moment that I have to." [...] The Seattle Post-Intelligencers TV critic John Levesque has commented that Sorkin's writing process [...] "can make for ill-advised plot developments". Further complicating the matter, in television, Sorkin will have a hand in writing every episode, rarely letting other writers earn full credit on a script. Peter De Jonge has reported that ex-writers of The West Wing have claimed that [...] "even by the spotlight-hogging standards of Hollywood, Sorkin has been exceptionally ungenerous in his sharing of writing credit". In a comment to GQ magazine in 2008, Sorkin said, [...] "I'm helped by a staff of people who have great ideas, but the scripts aren't written by committee." ...|$|E

[...] Director and choreographer Prabhu Deva ranked Server Sundaram among his favourite films. A restaurant named [...] "Hotel Server Sundaram" [...] is located in the Thuraipakkam area of Chennai. In December 2014, G. Babu Jayakumar of The New Indian Express included the film in his list of Balachander's noted films. Clips from Server Sundaram were screened along with clips from other films such as Iru Kodugal (1969), Arangetram (1973), Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974), Avargal (1977) and Azhagan (1991) at a function held in Balachander's honour at Tiruchirappalli in January 2015, a month after his death. Server Sundaram is also used as the title of an 2017 film starring Santhanam and Nagesh's grandson Bijesh, with its producer Selva having bought the title rights from AVM Productions. On why that title was chosen, Selva said, [...] "Santhanam plays a chef in the film and we felt that Server Sundaram, in which Nagesh played the role of a server, would be apt for this film, too. It is amazing how well the title suited the concept of our film, which is why we went right ahead with our decision." [...] S. Jegathiswaran, writing for Daily News Sri Lanka, noted, [...] "In [...] Sundaram, [...] showed that after having gained the social status one shouldn't forget one's past." [...] Actor Vikram, who became popularly known by the moniker [...] "Chiyaan" [...] after the release of Sethu in 1999, stated in August 2016, [...] "After Nagesh sir [...] becomes something else, he still holds his server uniform close to his heart as a memento. Chiyaan is something like that to me." ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{invitation}} of his cousin John Amory Lowell, James Russell Lowell was asked to deliver a lecture at the prestigious Lowell Institute. Some speculated the opportunity {{was because of the}} family connection, offered as an attempt to bring him out of his depression. Lowell chose to speak on [...] "The English Poets", telling his friend Briggs that he would take revenge on dead poets [...] "for the injuries received by one whom the public won't allow among the living". The first of the twelve-part lecture series was to be on January 9, 1855, though by December, Lowell had only completed writing five of them, hoping for last-minute inspiration. His first lecture was on John Milton and the auditorium was oversold; Lowell had to give a repeat performance the next afternoon. Lowell, who had never spoken in public before, was praised for these lectures. Francis James Child said that Lowell, whom he deemed was typically [...] "perverse", was able to [...] "persist in being serious contrary to his impulses and his talents". While his series was still in progress, Lowell was offered the Smith Professorship of Modern Languages at Harvard, a post vacated by Longfellow, at an annual salary of $1,200, though he never applied for it. The job description was changing after Longfellow; instead of teaching languages directly, Lowell would supervise the department and deliver two lecture courses per year on topics of his own choosing. Lowell accepted the appointment, with the proviso that he should have a year of study abroad. He set sail on June 4 of that year, leaving his daughter Mabel in the care of a governess named Frances Dunlap. Abroad, he visited Le Havre, Paris, and London, spending time with friends including Story, Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and Leigh Hunt. Primarily, however, Lowell spent his time abroad studying languages, particularly German, which he found difficult. He complained: [...] "The confounding genders! If I die I shall have engraved on my tombstone that I died of der, die, das, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> caught them but because I couldn't." ...|$|E

"Whenever I'm {{asked to}} name a {{favourite}} of my songs I usually choose this one, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> think it's 'the best' but because it best captures everything I try to do when writing any song.

He was educated at Gresham's School, an {{independent}} boarding school in Holt, Norfolk, from 1956 to 1965, when his father died of cancer. He excelled at long distance running: [...] "I was quite good at it, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was physically good, but because I had more determination. I learnt determination from it." [...] He spent one year (1965–1966) at the Byam Shaw School of Art, and then studied furniture and interior design at the Royal College of Art (1966–1970) before moving into engineering.|$|E

[...] Revealing that Birley had numerous other girlfriends from the beginning of their relationship, she added: [...] "I think he was absolutely incapable of being faithful. He was a serial adulterer. Like a butterfly, he had to seduce every woman. Despite their divorce, the two remained best friends and soulmates, talking to each other every day and holidaying together until Birley's death in August 2007.

In a 1971 review for Creem magazine, critic Dave Marsh wrote, [...] "My response is that crystallization of everything that is rock'n'roll music, at its finest, was to allow my jaw to drop, my body to move, to leap out of the chair ... It is an experience that one desires simply to share, to play over and over again for those he knows thirst for such pleasure.
