5|$|Several major {{weaknesses}} in Akagis design were not rectified. Akagis aviation fuel tanks were incorporated {{directly into the}} structure of the carrier, meaning that shocks to the ship, such as those caused by bomb or shell hits, would be transmitted directly to the tanks, resulting in cracks or leaks. Also, the fully enclosed structure of the new hangar decks made firefighting difficult, at least in part because fuel vapors could accumulate in the hangars. Adding to the danger was the requirement of the Japanese carrier doctrine that aircraft be serviced, fueled, and armed whenever possible on the hangar decks rather than on the flight deck. Furthermore, the carrier's hangar and flight decks carried little armor protection, and there was <b>no</b> <b>redundancy</b> in the ship's fire-extinguishing systems. These weaknesses would later be crucial factors in the loss of the ship.|$|E
5|$|Single {{cylinder}} {{consists of}} a single large cylinder, usually back mounted, with one first-stage regulator, and usually two second-stage regulators. This configuration is simple and cheap but it has only a single breathing gas supply: it has <b>no</b> <b>redundancy</b> in case of failure. If the cylinder or first-stage regulator fails, the diver is totally out of air and faces a life-threatening emergency. Recreational diver training agencies train divers {{to rely on a}} buddy to assist them in this situation. The skill of gas sharing is trained on most entry level scuba courses. This equipment configuration, although common with entry-level divers and used for most sport diving, is not recommended by training agencies for any dive where decompression stops are needed, or where there is an overhead environment (wreck diving, cave diving, or ice diving) as it provides no functional redundancy.|$|E

50|$|For {{many years}} {{addresses}} in Shamokin Dam were listed {{under the same}} ZIP code as Selinsgrove, which was 17870. This led to confusion by delivery companies, emergency services and visitors to the region. Additionally, tax funding that {{should have gone to}} Shamokin Dam was lost. The implementation of the GIS readdressing program required that several local communities rename streets so that there were <b>no</b> <b>redundancies</b> within the Selinsgrove ZIP code. This prompted Shamokin Dam officials to appeal to the United States Postal Service for a unique ZIP code. It was awarded. Shamokin Dam addresses became 17876.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we have studied {{the problem of how}} to extend the {{concepts}} of Functional Dependency (FD) and normalization in relational databases to include the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) model. We shown that, like relational databases, XML documents may contain redundant information and this redundancy may cause update anomalies. Furthermore, such problems are caused by certain functional dependencies among paths in the document. Our goal is to find a way for converting an arbitrary XML Schema to a well-designed one, that avoids these problems. We introduced new definitions of FD and normal forms of XML Schema (X- 1 NF, X- 2 NF, X- 3 NF and X-BCNF). We shown that our normal forms are necessary and sufficient to ensure all conforming XML documents have <b>no</b> <b>redundancies...</b>|$|R

As of 1 November 1996 InterContinental owned the hotel with 95% after half a year the company bought the remaining 5% of employee shares. The contract contained the obligatory renovation condition and the restriction of <b>no</b> <b>redundancies</b> within a year. The name change from Forum to InterContinental took place on 6 May 1997.
