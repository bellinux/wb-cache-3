This system of memory management is almost <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> more, since programs often contain bugs which can cause them to exceed their allocated memory. If a program fails, it may cause memory used {{by one or more}} other programs to be affected or overwritten. Malicious programs or viruses may purposefully alter another program's memory, or may affect the operation of the operating system itself. With cooperative memory management, it takes only one misbehaved program to crash the system.|$|E

500|$|Early {{on in the}} {{development}} process, the producers wanted to cast a [...] "brilliant actor" [...] with a strong screen presence. They discussed casting Rupert Penry-Jones {{for the role of}} Adam Carter early in the process, though it took months to finally decide to cast him. Though Penry-Jones was aware of Spooks and its success, he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> episodes. To be interested in the role, he spent a weekend catching up on the entire first and second series. He did not take long to decide, since his last leading role was four years previously, in 2000 in the Channel 4 drama North Square. Adam was originally meant to be older, and more [...] "street." [...] When he found acting [...] "street" [...] was too difficult, Penry-Jones acted more like himself. He had to audition three times before the producers included him, four months before filming commenced.|$|E
500|$|His first {{professional}} script writing credit {{came when he}} wrote the radio drama The Long Stairs, broadcast by the BBC on 1 March 1950 and based on an historical mining disaster on the Isle of Man. In 1951 he was recruited {{as one of the}} first staff writers to be employed by BBC Television; before he started working for the BBC, Kneale had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> television. Kneale was initially a general-purpose writer, working on adaptations of books and stage plays and even writing material for light entertainment and children's programmes. The following year, Michael Barry became the Head of Drama at BBC Television, and spent his entire first year's script budget of £250 to hire Kneale as a full-time writer for the drama department. Kneale's first credited role in adult television drama was providing [...] "additional dialogue" [...] for the play Arrow to the Heart, broadcast on 20 July 1952. This play was adapted and directed by the Austrian television director Rudolph Cartier, who had also joined the staff of the BBC drama department in 1952. It was the beginning of a successful working relationship between the pair, that would lead to some of Kneale's best known work.|$|E

2500|$|García Lorca's {{return to}} Spain in 1930 {{coincided with the}} fall of the {{dictatorship}} of Primo de Rivera and the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic. In 1931, García Lorca was appointed director of a student theatre company, Teatro Universitario La Barraca (The Shack). It was funded by the Second Republic's Ministry of Education, and it was charged with touring Spain's rural areas in order to introduce audiences to radically modern interpretations of classic Spanish theatre free of charge. With a portable stage and little equipment, they sought to bring theatre to people who had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any,</b> with García Lorca directing as well as acting. He commented: [...] "Outside of Madrid, the theatre, which is in its very essence a part {{of the life of the}} people, is almost dead, and the people suffer accordingly, as they would if they had lost their two eyes, or ears, or a sense of taste. We [...] are going to give it back to them". His experiences traveling through impoverished rural Spain and New York (particularly amongst the disenfranchised African American population), transformed him into a passionate advocate of the theatre of social action. He wrote [...] "The theatre is a school of weeping and of laughter, a free forum, where men can question norms that are outmoded or mistaken and explain with living example the eternal norms of the human heart".|$|E

2500|$|The {{creator and}} {{caretaker}} of the engine. Dustin Hoffman was {{considered for the}} role. About the character, Harris said, [...] "He's so built up, who this guy is, and then there's this big thing open, and he's just this old guy making dinner with his robe on, but director Bong really {{wanted him to be}} matter-of-fact and very mundane, and simple, and kind of freaky that way." [...] also added that the character is [...] "probably a coagulation of various folks". The role of Wilford was the last to be cast, and it was friend and fellow filmmaker Park Chan-Wook who suggested Harris for the role. Bong stated that Wilford needed to be played by someone with [...] "tremendous presence and performance from the first moment that he appeared in order to convince the audience", adding that [...] " [...] turned Wilford into a lively and ironic character with added appeal." [...] On taking the role of Wilford, Harris mentioned, [...] "When I was sent this script, I was told director Bong is a Korean director, and that he'd made some other films, but I had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> of them [...] I thought they were wonderfully accomplished films, which really made me want to work with the guy. I'm a big fan of his." [...] Harris was very praiseworthy of Bong, especially his tendency of editing the piece whilst shooting. Since the film's release, Bong has revealed background information about the character, such as Wilford being bisexual, [...] "He slept with Claude, the Egg-Head, Mason, and the pregnant teacher. Yet, his the One is the Engine." [...] Tyler John Williams portrays a young Wilford.|$|E
