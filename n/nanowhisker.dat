The crystal structure and surface morphology of the MBH <b>nanowhiskers</b> are studied. XRD patterns reveal that the as-prepared <b>nanowhiskers</b> are pure MgBO 2 (OH) with monoclinic phase.

When compared with the MBH-NON <b>nanowhiskers,</b> the nanostructures synthesized with surfactants show optical absorption peaks with maximum intensity at around 350 nm (photon energy of 3.55 eV), which can be related to the absorption in the band gap region. The optical band gap values estimated from the optical band edge plots ((αhγ) 2 vs. hγ, not shown) for MBH-CTAB, MBH-SDS, MBH-Triton-In Autoclave and MBH-Triton-In open beaker are 2.64, 2.7, 2.5 and 2.62 eV, respectively. The large difference in the optical band gap for MBH-NON <b>nanowhiskers</b> and MBH <b>nanowhiskers</b> synthesized with various surfactants arises {{due to the fact that}} the surfactants can induce the formation of intermediate surface defect states in the band gap region [36]. The reduced optical band gap values can also be assigned to the increased aspect ratio of the <b>nanowhiskers</b> with the addition of surfactants (MBH-CTAB and MBH-Triton). The increase in the absorption peak intensity and band gap for MBH-SDS <b>nanowhiskers</b> in comparison with the MBH-CTAB and MBH-Triton-In Autoclave can be assigned to the reduced particle size [37]. MBH-Triton-In open beaker urchin-like <b>nanowhiskers</b> also shows increased band gap than the MBH-Triton-In Autoclave <b>nanowhiskers</b> due to the smaller particle size.|$|R

Successful surface modification and retention of the crystalline morphology of the nanocrystals was confirmed by elemental analysis, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The coverage with ferrocenyl is high (approximately 1. 14 × 10 - 3 mol g - 1 or 4. 6 × 10 13 mol cm - 2 corresponding to a specific area of 61 ̊ 2 per ferrocene). Cyclic voltammetry measurements of films formed by deposition of ferrocene-decorated nanowhiskers showed that this small spacing of redox centers along the <b>nanowhisker</b> surface allowed conduction hopping of electrons. The apparent diffusion coefficient for electron (or hole) hopping via Fe(III/II) surface sites is estimated as D app = 10 - 19 m 2 s - 1 via impedance methods, a value significantly less than nonsolvated ferrocene polymers, which would be expected as the 1, 2, 3 -triazole ring forms a rigid linker tethering the ferrocene to the <b>nanowhisker</b> surface.

The cellulose <b>nanowhiskers</b> can act as efficient reinforcement because of the high aspect ratios, important surface areas and high modulus.

40|$|ZnO <b>nanowhiskers</b> {{were used}} for {{photodecomposition}} of methylene blue in aqueous solution under UV irradiation. The rate of methylene blue degradation increased linearly with time of UV irradiation. 54 % of degradation rate was observed when the ZnO <b>nanowhiskers</b> were used as photocatalysts for methylene blue degradation for 80 min under UV irradiation. The decoration of p-type NiO nanoparticles on n-type ZnO <b>nanowhiskers</b> significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity and reached 72 % degradation rate of methylene blue by using the same method. NiO-decorated ZnO was recycled for second test and shows 66 % degradation from maximal peak of methylene blue within the same period. The increment of photocatalytic activity of NiO-decorated ZnO <b>nanowhiskers</b> was explained by {{the extension of the}} electron depletion layer due to the formation of nanoscale p-n junctions between p-type NiO and n-type ZnO. Hence, these products provide new alternative proficient photocatalysts for wastewater treatment...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we carry}} out high {{temperature}} glancing angle deposition (HT-GLAD) of Fe and Al on a heated substrate with trench patterns. When vapor is incident perpendicular to the trench direction, <b>nanowhiskers</b> grow only on the surface exposed to the vapor and not inside the trenches. When vapor is incident at a deposition angle larger than 80 ° on the sidewall of the trench {{and not on the}} substrate surface, <b>nanowhiskers</b> grow only on the sidewall because the condition of deposition at a high temperature and a large deposition angle is satisfied only for the sidewall. Thus, we succeed in the selective growth of <b>nanowhiskers</b> by controlling the geometrical deposition conditions. Further, we also discuss the effect of the local deposition geometry on the growth process. Geometrically selective growth by HT-GLAD is expected to be useful for growing <b>nanowhiskers</b> on nano- and microstructured substrates...|$|R
40|$|Cellulose nanocrytals and chitin nanocrystals {{respectively}} {{were isolated}} from bioresidues viz, sludge from special cellulose production and crab shell waste using acid hydrolysis. The atomic force micrscopy images {{showed that the}} diameter of CNWs ranged from 10 - 20 nm and chitin whiskers ranged from 20 - 40 nm. Thermal degrdation temperatures of nanocellulose and nanochitin whiskers {{were found to be}} 186 °C and 234 °C respectively. The crystallinity index of CNWs was 72. 3 % while that of chitin <b>nanowhiskers</b> was as high as 87. 2 %. Conductivity titration and zeta sizer studies proved the high surface charge of both CNWs and chitin <b>nanowhiskers.</b> Besides, chitin <b>nanowhiskers</b> are positively surface charged at acidic pH and negatively surface charged at alkaline pH. ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) will be conducted to evaluate the adsorption potential of CNWs and chitin <b>nanowhiskers</b> to heavy metal ions as functions of pH and surface charge.
