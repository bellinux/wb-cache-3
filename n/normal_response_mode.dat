The results of elastic <b>normal</b> <b>mode</b> <b>response</b> spectrum analyses of a 10 -storey building considering several structural variables are presented in terms of envelope values of the ratio of maximum base shear at flexural capacity to that assuming a code lateral load distribution.

40|$|In this Master Thesis {{a method}} for {{estimating}} seabed p-wave velocities from normal mode seismic data is developed. This is done through forward modeling using two dimensional finite difference modeling to generate synthetic data based on a given parallel two layered laterally varying seabed velocity model and a constant two layered density model, with a common fixed water depth. A semblance inversion technique is developed in MATLAB using the period equation eqref{eq:period} and the resulting velocity profiles is plotted against the exact velocity model to check {{the validity of the}} estimates. The same method is extended to estimations of seabed densities. For analysis of the robustness of the method, analysis with added pseudo random noise is preformed. The results shows a good performance of the semblance method to reproduce the model velocity parameters. The introduction of noise is handled well and decent results are obtained for significantly low signal to noise ratios. It suggests that the semblance method is applicable to use for determination of other parameters influencing the <b>normal</b> <b>mode</b> <b>response</b> signal. </p...|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} an analytical model {{to estimate the}} mathematical expectation of the data center (DC) response time to the interactive requests from remote users connected to the DC via leased lines (LL), which run under control of HDLC-type protocols for configurations "pointpoint» and "point - multipoint » in <b>Normal</b> <b>Response</b> <b>Mode,</b> NRM. In the logic connection DC acts as the host (primary node) and remote stations {{play the role of}} the slave units (secondary nodes). The objective of research is to obtain analytical expressions to define the following: - Mathematical expectation of waiting time required for input and output messages of each class to start transmitting via leased line; - Mathematical expectation of total DC response time to requests of each class. The process of interaction between remote workstations and DC is formalized as a closed three-node queuing network (QN), wherein the first multi-channel node corresponds to the phase of request deliberation (preparation) to DC on the workstation. In this phase, the number of facilities, i. e. service channels, is equal to the number of workstations (terminals), R. The second single-channel node of this QN reflects processing of input and output messages to the LL in accordance with the logic of HDLC protocol. The third multi-channel node of this NQ reflects, as a matter of fact, processing query to DC. In this node one process in DC corresponds to each active terminal, i. e., the number of facilities is equal to the number of workstations R. It is shown that the problem of determining the DC average response time to requests of remote users is reduced to the problem of determining the average waiting time for the input and output messages to start transmitting messages by LL - that sort of unknown average waiting time turns out to be 2 R. The first two points of the probability distribution functions of reflection time, LL transmission time, and time of message processing, as a matter of fact, in DC are assumed to be specified. To create a system of algebraic equations in regard to the unknown average waiting time for the input and output messages to start LL sending a so-called method of "labeled transaction" is used. The system of equations is constructed, initially, to provide the "point-multipoint configuration. " Then it is shown how to obtain a system for configuration "point-point" as a special case. The first phase considers an arrival of the "labelled transaction" submitting output message in QN and builds R equations in regard to the unknown average waiting time for the output message to start its sending by LL from DC to the workstation. The second phase considers an arrival of the "labelled transaction" submitting input message in QN and builds R equations in regard to the unknown average waiting time for the input message to start its sending by LL from the workstation to DC. The result is a system of the 2 R algebraic equations in regard to 2 R unknown average waiting time for a start of message transmission by LL. The existence of a unique solution of the resulting system of equations is proved, and a computationally efficient procedure for determining solution as a modified Newton-Kantorovich method is proposed. The paper shows how to obtain a system of equations for the "point-point" configuration, as a special case, from the system of equations for the "point-multipoint" configuration. It presents the formulas for calculating the DC average response time to remote users’ requests for each workstation. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} experimentally {{the nature}} of people's risk-attitudes across different payoff domains and <b>response</b> <b>modes.</b> Only simple gambles are examined, entailing just two monetary outcomes. The main issue of interest is to what extent risk-preferences in one domain or <b>response</b> <b>mode</b> predict anything (beyond chance) about risk-preferences in another domain or mode. Three domains are examined: gain, mixed and loss. The three <b>response</b> <b>modes</b> used are certainty equivalence (CE), probability equivalence (PE) and outcome equivalence (OE) judgments. In general, weak associations were found among ordinal risk-preferences within-subjects across domains, especially with respect to losses. To make the parametric responses (i. e., the CE, PE and OE judgments) comparable across domains and subjects, linear as well as utility-based risk-measures were examined. In the gain and loss domains, the linear risk-premia measures exhibited higher CE-PE correlations (within domain) than the utility-based measures. Using a multitrait-multimethod comparison, the highest correlations were found within domains across <b>response</b> <b>modes.</b> The main findings are (1) strong risk-aversion for gain and mixed gambles, (2) risk-seeking for symmetric loss gambles, although less pronounced, (3) low correlation of risk-preferences within subjects across domains, (4) high convergent validity of response methods within domain, and (5) increased risk-aversion for loss (but not gain) gambles when using real payoffs. risk-attitude, expected utility theory, <b>response</b> <b>mode</b> effects...|$|R
