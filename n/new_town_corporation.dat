5000|$|A {{well known}} centre was opened at Woodberry Down in October 1952. [...] It had {{provision}} for 6 GPs, 2 dentists, a pharmacist and two nurses. It cost about £163,000, {{which included the}} cost of a day nursery and child guidance clinic. This was regarded as extravagant and used as an excuse by critics for not building more.

50|$|The Housing Finance Act 1972 {{also brought}} {{fundamental}} changes to rent legislation. It became {{the duty of}} every local authority and <b>new</b> <b>town</b> <b>corporation</b> to determine a fair rent (on the same basis and definition as a fair rent for regulated tenancies) {{for every one of}} their housing revenue account dwellings. This was to be done by making provisional assessments of fair rents for their properties. These assessments had to be submitted to a rent scrutiny board that could confirm them or substitute different rents. These provisions were repealed in 1976. Dwellings owned by housing associations and housing trusts (usually charities), which were registered with the Housing Corporation (but not those that were registered societies under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965) were brought within the fair rent system. From 1 January 1973, their rents were to be determined by Rent Officers and registered in a separate part of the Rent Register. New subsidies were introduced for housing associations and housing trusts registered with the Housing Corporation.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} years of the {{creation}} of the <b>new</b> <b>town</b> the Glenrothes Development Corporation (GDC) with input from the local authority, then Fife County Council, oversaw the governance of the <b>new</b> <b>town.</b> In the early 1990s the then Conservative UK Government established a wind-up order for all of the UK's <b>new</b> <b>town</b> development <b>corporations.</b> Responsibilities for the assets, management and governance of all of the <b>new</b> <b>towns</b> were to be transferred to either private sector companies or to the local authorities or other government organisations.

50|$|At <b>New</b> Radnor, the <b>town</b> <b>corporation</b> {{controlled}} {{the creation of}} freemen, but the Steward of the King's Manors had the corresponding power at Knighton, Rhayader and Knucklas. These two sources of power competed with the other main landed interest, that of the Price family, for domination of Radnor elections in the 18th century, {{but it was the}} Steward who generally got his way. Henry Lewis was steward from 1746 until his death in 1768 and his brother, Thomas Lewis, was MP from 1715 to 1761 (when he was defeated because of technical errors in the registration of the freemen that supported him).|$|R
50|$|During its development, the new {{settlement}} faced {{some problems}} {{in the wake of}} a national recession. At the time, Bradley Stoke was reputed to be one of Europe's largest private housing developments and did struggle to develop at first to establish itself as an identifiable town unlike other earlier <b>new</b> <b>towns</b> which were supported by a <b>New</b> <b>Town</b> Development <b>Corporation,</b> as the settlement relied principally on private investment within a restricted statutory framework of the local authority Northavon District Council within the Avon County Council area. A combination of private house builder led the development and with only limited input from commercial businesses and the consequent recession resulted in the <b>new</b> <b>town</b> gaining a reputation for being a soulless housing estate with only limited facilities and no town centre, with the exception of a Tesco supermarket. High-interest rates during the early 1990s soon led to the collapse of the property market in the area with many new homes falling into negative equity. This led to the branding of the <b>new</b> <b>town</b> as 'Sadly Broke' until property values and the development market began to recover.|$|R
