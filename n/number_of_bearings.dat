50|$|The Brickley Engine is a {{patented}} {{proposal for}} the design of an internal combustion engine. One embodiment uses opposing pistons driving a central linkage mechanism which turns the crankshaft with a single connecting rod. This proposed design configuration changes the way the pistons are connected {{to each other and to}} the crankshaft, thus reducing engine friction. Additionally, by connecting the pistons to each other in a more efficient manner, it reduces the type and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearings</b> on the crankshaft for further reductions in friction. Reducing the internal friction of the engine should increase the fuel efficiency of the proposed engine as compared with the current design of one connecting rod per piston. The Brickley Engine was invented by Mike Brickley, an engineer from Austin, Texas. The engine configuration has three US patents.|$|E

The paper presents a generalized system of non-linear second-order ordinary differential equations for analysing multi-support spindle–bearing assemblies.

50|$|While {{some small}} single-cylinder engines {{have only one}} main bearing, {{designed}} {{to deal with the}} bending moment exerted by the crank {{as a result of the}} force from the connecting rod, most engines have at least two main bearings, one at each end of the crank shaft and may have as many as one more than the number of crank pins. Increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearings</b> in an engine will generally increase the size and cost of the engine, but also provides stability to the crankshaft, which would otherwise have to endure greater bending moments from having the crank pin further from a bearing. The combination of bearing number and crankshaft design can also have an effect on engine balance; a more stable crankshaft will better avoid unbalance from flexing, but increasing the crankshaft length or girth to accommodate an additional bearing increases the rotational inertia of the crankshaft, which can have the opposite effect.|$|E
50|$|Charts as {{far back}} as the 17th century show that the cyclic {{movement}} of the Sands was known. Although the chart of Robert Jager, 1629, (Shipwrecks of the Goodwin Sands, R & B Larne) may leave something to be desired in accuracy of the coastline, it seems to suggest that the South Sand Head was farther south than it was in the next century and that the Head was turning back upon itself in cyclic movement. Early in the eighteenth century the South Sand Head was still so far south that the chart of Charles Labelye,1736,(Public Records Office)shows a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearings,</b> one of which runs through the two lighthouses then in existence and unmistakably strikes the Head. Richard Larne (Shipwrecks of the Goodwin Sands) estimates the increase/decrease at 4000 feet a century. It would seem to have been a foolish act to build two lighthouses to cover a bearing that so soon would be useless even if new sites were selected. Less widely known is the fact that a lightship of sorts is said to have been stationed at the South Sands Head since Elizabethan times for the express purpose of guiding the fleet into the anchorage of the Downs, although evidence for this assertion is slim. How effective a primitive light vessel may have been is a matter of speculation.|$|E

A total of 30 960 virtual 50 -mm bore deep-groove ball bearings were evaluated in 33 different sudden death test configurations comprising 36, 72, and 144 bearings each. Variations in both life and Weibull slope were {{a function of the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearings</b> failed independent of the test method used and not the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearings</b> tested. Variation in L 10 life as a function of <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearings</b> failed were similar to variations in lift obtained from sequentially failed real bearings and from Monte Carlo (virtual) testing of entire populations. Reductions up to 40 percent in bearing test time and calendar time can be achieved by testing to failure or the L(sub 50) life and terminating all testing when the last of the predetermined bearing failures has occurred. Sudden death testing is not a more efficient method to reduce bearing test time or calendar time when compared to censored sequential testing...|$|E

This system is implemented into a software and is aimed to facilitate the seismic upgrading of an overpass by isolating its deck with the inclusion of elastomeric bearings. The preliminary design of such an upgrade scheme is the target of this software based on the current design provisions of Eurocode 8 (Part 2) {{as well as on}} engineering decisions included in the expert system; it can also be extended easily to comply with alternative design provisions. The developed software is connected with a database of typically used steel laminated rubber bearings and relevant laboratory test results and it performs a series of checks according to Eurocode 8, in order to ensure the satisfactory seismic performance of the selected upgrade scheme. The parameters that are addressed within this software as independent variables are: the geometry of the overpass, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearings</b> at each deck support, the level of seismic action and the characteristics of the bearings (i. e. their geometry and shear modulus).
