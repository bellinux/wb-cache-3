The existing technologies though, as designed, are expected to be gender <b>neutral,</b> <b>lead</b> to gender differences at the adoption stage. This was confirmed during a study conducted in Kathekakai settlement scheme, Machakos district where despite both men and women participating in soil and water conservation initiatives, women’s efforts to adopt the recommended technologies were hampered by their limited access to authoritative informa-tion and lack of control over land. Women though playing major roles as farmers (64. 6 %), could not make key decisions on land use. Previous reports indicate that the women in Machakos district contributed significantly to soil and water conservation efforts in the mid 1980 ’s leading to terracing of over 70 % of the district.

Earlier studies showing a high frequency of ischaemic electrocardiographic abnormalities in women are confirmed; it is suggested that this may reflect a high work load per unit mass of myocardium. Training induces an elevation of the ST segment at rest and during recovery, with a reduction in ST depression during work at a given heart rate, the exercise changes being related to the intensity and frequency of training selected by the subject. Possible explanations of the response to regular exercise include not only the development of the collateral circulation, but also a lessening of the hyperkalaemia of effort and a reduction in the work load per unit mass of myocardium secondary to hypertrophy or a change in the average dimensions of the heart...|$|E

It was a very useful white pigment as base and could be applied in painting with various organic dye tints [11]. Two mineral phases, cerussite (PbCO 3) and hydrocerussite (Pb 3 (CO 3) 2 (OH) 2), were the main composition of basic white lead [17]. In the fingerprint region at 1500 – 650  cm− 1, the peaks occurring at 1415, 1046, 681  cm− 1 corresponded to the strong stretching vibrations of CO 32 − for <b>neutral</b> <b>lead</b> carbonate (cerussite), calcium carbonate (aragonite) and basic lead carbonate (hydrocerussite), the weak absorbance band near 3537  cm− 1 was attributable to OH stretching for the latter [13, 18].

The three C–O bands at 1162, 1094 and 1046  cm− 1 occurred in a maple leaf pattern were characteristic of drying oils; moreover, because of containing ester group, the absorbance peak of C=O appeared at ca. 1736  cm− 1 [19]. While combining with other characteristic peaks of 2920, 2850  cm− 1 (CH 2), 1650  cm− 1 (Amide I band) and 1540  cm− 1 (Amide II band), the existence of organic binding medium was also proved which may be associated with protein, drying oils or the beeswax [20].|$|E
40|$|Measures of {{autonomic}} activity {{have long}} been the indices of choice in western research on orienting and habituation. Recent research, however, has suggested blink reflexes {{as a measure of}} attentional processes that occur during generalised and localised orienting. Two experiments assessed whether generalised orienting affects blink reflex modulation and whether effects of orienting are mediated by stimulus modality. Attention to a lead stimulus is said to enhance blink reflexes if lead and reflex stimuli are presented in the same sensory modality, but is said to reduce blink reflexes if the stimuli are presented in different modalities. Lead stimuli used in previous studies, however, differed in interest and in valence, which renders the interpretation of results difficult. The present experiments used <b>neutral</b> <b>lead</b> stimuli in a stimulus change procedure to avoid potential confounds. In Experiment 1 (n = 32), participants were presented during habituation training with 43 lead stimuli (4 s), 40 of which were tactile. Acoustic or visual change stimuli were presented on trials 25, 33, and 43. In Experiment 2 (n - 64), modality of the lead stimulus (acoustic vs. visual) was crossed with experimental condition (Change vs. No Change). Blink eliciting noise bursts were presented during inter-trial intervals and at lead intervals of 2. 5 and 3. 5 s during some habituation and all change stimuli. Lead stimulus change resulted in increased electrodermal orienting in both experiments. The extent of blink latency shortening and of blink magnitude facilitation increased from habituation to change trials regardless of whether the change stimulus was presented in the same modality as was the reflex eliciting stimulus. These results are not consistent with findings from previous research that employed interesting and dull lead stimuli and indicate that effects of generalised orienting on reflex modification are not stimulus modality specific...|$|E
30|$|A {{variety of}} organic and {{inorganic}} pigments have been previously identified on the corpus of 150 polychromed qeros referred to above, the style-based dates of {{which range from}} the late Inka period to around 1821, when Peru gained independence from Spain [3]. The non-white pigments found include orpiment, pararealgar, cinnabar, copper-based pigments, carbon black, earth pigments, and the organic dyestuffs cochineal and indigo. These materials are known to occur naturally in the Andes or to have been manufactured and used during the pre-Columbian and later periods as mineral pigments applied to wood and other substrates or as textile dyestuffs [20 – 24]. White pigments have received lesser attention. On Andean easel and wall paintings from colonial times, the predominant variety has generally {{been found to be}} lead white, consisting of basic lead carbonate (2 PbCO 3 ·Pb(OH) 2) often mixed with <b>neutral</b> <b>lead</b> carbonate (PbCO 3) [23], while published analyses of occurrences on Inka and pre-Inka painted surfaces most often describe calcium-based minerals, such as calcite, gypsum and apatite [25 – 28]. Occasional instances of early white pigments bearing Ti and/or Si have been reported, most often as clay-based minerals with quartz and/or titanium dioxide as minor constituents [25, 26, 29, 30]. On the qeros that we have studied and that can be stylistically dated to colonial times, we have found the white pigment to be exclusively lead white. However, on earlier examples, we have found the white pigment to be a material rich in Ti and Si with little evidence of clay; this pigment is the subject of the present paper. We discovered it during our early work on the qero project and outlined it briefly in a previous communication [16]. This material occurs on only twelve qeros that we have examined to date, including the excavated example from Ollantaytambo, here identified as Museo Inka 230, and appears to represent the white pigment and binder used on the earliest polychromed qeros. We will argue that the materials and technology of this pigment likely pre-date Spanish influence. We also describe here a geological anomaly known as the “Giacomo Deposit” and situated near the modern city of Tacna in southern Peru that may provide a plausible source for this pigment. This mineral deposit was being offered for exploitation as a commercial mine for titanium dioxide and silica in 2009, and several websites describing it remain as of 2018 [31 – 33].|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{analytical}} {{model for the}} damping of Alfvén waves in the partially ionized chromosphere. The damping is due to collisions between ions and neutrals. The ionneutral collision frequency in this environment is such that the ion and neutral populations are almost perfectly collisionally coupled, leading the Alfvén wave to behave as if it acts on the whole plasma (i. e. including neutrals). The small but finite coupling time between ions and <b>neutrals</b> <b>leads</b> to damping of the Alfvén waves. We find {{that this type of}} damping of upward traveling Alfvén waves with frequencies between 0. 2 and 0. 6 Hz, can cause not only significant heating but also upward motion of the upper chromospheric plasma. In addition the upward force and heating associated with this type of damping can sustain, both dynamically and thermodynamically, an already formed chromospheric spicule. The energy flux carried by the Alfvén waves needed for this type of support of a spicule {{does not seem to be}} in contradiction with observational and theoretical evidence for the presence of Alfvén waves in the chromosphere...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} a close relationship between the time derivative of the horizontal geomagnetic field vector (dH/dt) and geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) at a nearby location in a power grid. Similarly, a high correlation exists between GIC and the local horizontal geoelectric field (E), typically modelled from a measured magnetic field. 				Considering GIC forecasting, it is not feasible to assume that detailed prediction of time series will be possible. Instead, other measures summarising the activity level over a given period are preferable. In this paper, we consider the 30 -min maximum of dH/dt or E as a local activity indicator (|dH/dt| 30 or |E| 30). Concerning GIC, we use the sum of currents through the <b>neutral</b> <b>leads</b> at substations and apply its 30 -min maximum as a regional activity measure (GIC 30). 				We show that |dH/dt| 30 at a single point yields a proxy for GIC activity in a larger region. A practical consequence is that if |dH/dt| 30 can be predicted at some point then {{it is also possible}} to assess the expected GIC level in the surrounding area. As is also demonstrated, |E| 30 and GIC 30 depend linearly on |dH/dt| 30, so there is no saturation with increasing geomagnetic activity contrary to often used activity indices...|$|R
