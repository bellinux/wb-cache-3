5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, the <b>Newfoundland</b> Weather Centre posted wind warnings, gale warnings, storm warnings, and {{hurricane}} warnings throughout <b>Newfoundland.</b> Rainfall advisories were also issued in portions of the East Coast, Central <b>Newfoundland,</b> the South Coast, and the West Coast. Offshore, storm force wind warnings were declared on October19 for <b>Newfoundland</b> waters. Several Special Weather Statements were also posted.|$|E
5|$|As {{the results}} of the binding {{referendum}} were to join Canada, <b>Newfoundland</b> began to negotiate with Canada to enter into Confederation. After negotiations were completed, the British Government received the terms and the British North America Act 1949 was subsequently passed by the British Parliament and given Royal Assent. <b>Newfoundland</b> officially joined Canada at midnight, March 31, 1949. At the elections for the <b>Newfoundland</b> House of Assembly two months later, Smallwood's Liberal Party won and controlled the provincial government until the 1970s. Reactions to Confederation were mixed.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} health {{problems}} associated with <b>Newfoundlands.</b> <b>Newfoundlands</b> are prone to hip dysplasia (a malformed ball and socket in the hip joint). They also get Elbow dysplasia, and cystinuria (a hereditary defect that forms calculi stones in the bladder). Another genetic problem is subvalvular aortic stenosis (SAS). This is a common heart defect in <b>Newfoundlands</b> involving defective heart valves. SAS can cause sudden death at an early age. It is similar to having a heart attack. It is common that [...] "Newfs" [...] live to be 8 to 10 years of age; 10 years is a commonly cited life expectancy. But, <b>Newfoundlands</b> can live up to 15 years old.|$|R

5|$|In a {{study of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA published in 2012, the <b>Newfoundland</b> pony and Canadian horse {{were found to be}} the most genetically diverse of the Canadian breeds studied, which also included the Sable Island horse and the Lac La Croix pony. When an estimation was made using microsatellite loci, the <b>Newfoundland</b> was found to have high autosomal diversity and a high number of haplotypes, some of which overlapped with the mountain and moorland pony breeds (historically documented as the ancestors of the <b>Newfoundland),</b> Nordic breeds and a feral population at Saint-Pierre et Miquelon. Overlapping haplotypes also suggested a relationship with the Standardbred and Clydesdale, suggesting possible crossbreeding at some point, although previous studies using microsatellite markers had not come to this conclusion. Although the microsatellite loci showed a relationship between the <b>Newfoundland</b> and the Sable Island horse, the study did not find overlapping haplotypes that would support this, possibly due to the population bottleneck in the 1980s that may have resulted in such haplotypes being lost. In order to be registered with the <b>Newfoundland</b> Pony Society, ponies must undergo DNA testing to verify <b>Newfoundland</b> parentage.|$|E
5|$|Just a {{week after}} Hurricane Juan hit Nova Scotia, the <b>Newfoundland</b> and Labrador Emergency Measures Organization advised the general public to take {{appropriate}} actions for the anticipated effects of Hurricane Kate, including high winds and potentially up to 3in (80mm) of rain. Such actions include securing loose objects, cleaning debris from storm drains, and owning appropriate hurricane supplies (such as a charged cell phone and batteries {{in the event of}} power outages). A cruise ship scheduled to stop in St. John's bypassed <b>Newfoundland</b> to avoid the storm. The <b>Newfoundland</b> and Maritimes Weather Center issued a storm warning for <b>Newfoundland,</b> while the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued a hurricane-force wind warning. Due to the expected combination of moisture from Kate and a cold front, the Canadian Hurricane Centre also issued a heavy rainfall warning for southeastern <b>Newfoundland.</b> Offshore, waves were expected to reach 33feet (10m), while marine wind warnings were issued as well.|$|E

5|$|Lasting {{impressions}} of the war experience are ever-prevalent on the island. In Canada, 1 July is celebrated as Canada Day, in recognition of Canadian confederation. In the Canadian province of <b>Newfoundland</b> and Labrador the date is Memorial Day, in remembrance of the <b>Newfoundland</b> Regiment's losses at Beaumont-Hamel. Memorial University College, now Memorial University of <b>Newfoundland,</b> was originally established as a memorial to Newfoundlanders who {{had lost their lives}} in active service during the First World War. Lastly, the six caribou memorials and the National War Memorial erected following the First World War, and the establishment of the preserved battlefield park at Beaumont-Hamel which is visited by thousands of tourists a year.

Prior to the storm's arrival, the <b>Newfoundland</b> Weather Forecast Office issued a hurricane warning for southeastern <b>Newfoundland.</b> The ferry between Nova Scotia and <b>Newfoundland</b> was disrupted, and boats across the region were sent back to harbor.

5|$|Quickly {{accelerating}} northwards, Helene made landfall on <b>Newfoundland</b> late on September29. Rainfall {{peaked at}} 3.05in (77.5mm) in northern {{parts of the}} island, while rainfall amounts were generally minimal across the Avalon Peninsula. A weather station in Naval Station Argentia reported maximum sustained winds of 60mph (100km/h) and a gust of 82mph (132km/h). The winds severed communications in southwestern <b>Newfoundland</b> and cut communications in St. John's, <b>Newfoundland</b> and Labrador from the mainland. Bell Island was {{cut off from the}} rest of <b>Newfoundland</b> due to rough seas generated by Helene, which resulted in the destruction of piers and lack of boat service. Damage caused by the hurricane on the island were estimated to be in excess of C$100,000.|$|E
5|$|St. John's {{served as}} {{the capital city of}} the Colony of <b>Newfoundland</b> and the Dominion of <b>Newfoundland</b> before <b>Newfoundland</b> became Canada's tenth {{province}} in 1949.

The Confederation Building, located on Confederation Hill, is home to the House of Assembly along with the offices for the Members of the House of Assembly (MHAs) and Ministers. The city is represented by ten MHAs, four who are members of the governing Progressive Conservative Party, three that belong to the New Democratic Party (NDP), and three that belong to the Liberal Party.

5|$|The <b>Newfoundland</b> pony is a {{breed of}} pony {{originating}} in <b>Newfoundland,</b> Canada. They are sturdy and muscular ponies, {{found in many}} colors, including the relatively rare white coloration. The <b>Newfoundland</b> developed from a mix of English, Irish and Scottish pony breeds brought to <b>Newfoundland</b> by settlers {{over a period of}} four centuries. Initially free-roaming, they crossbred to produce the modern type. They were used by settlers as draft and multi-purpose ponies until the mid-20th century, when they were brought {{almost to the point of}} extinction by mechanization and slaughter. The population rebounded slightly after the formation of a breed registry in 1980, but still remains low. In 1997, the <b>Newfoundland</b> pony was declared a heritage breed of <b>Newfoundland</b> and Labrador, which afforded it protection under the law, but the breed has not yet been recognized under the Canadian federal Animal Pedigree Act. As of 2008, there were 248 registered ponies of breeding age, out of a total population of 361. In 2013, the widely dispersed breeding population is still estimated at between 200 and 250 animals.|$|E
