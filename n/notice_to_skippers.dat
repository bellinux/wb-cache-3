60|$|The {{anxiety of}} the two men was sensed by Jerry, who, too, was on his toes. He pressed his cool nose <b>to</b> <b>Skipper's</b> leg, and the rose-kiss of his tongue brought him the salt taste of sea-water.|$|R

Unlike a man who can be simultaneously conscious of two states of mind, and who, swimming, would have known both the fear and the high courage with which he overrode the fear, Jerry, as he swam, knew only one state of mind, which was that he was swimming to the Arangi and <b>to</b> <b>Skipper.</b> At the moment preceding the first stroke of his paws in the water out of his depth, he had known all the terribleness of the taboo he deliberately broke. But, launched out, the decision made, the line of least resistance taken, he knew, single-thoughted, single-hearted, only that he was going <b>to</b> <b>Skipper.</b>|$|R

60|$|Jerry roused <b>to</b> <b>Skipper's</b> {{entrance}} {{under the}} blanket, and, quite {{as if it}} were a long-established custom, curled in between his arm and side, and, after one happy sniff and one kiss of his cool little tongue, as Skipper pressed his cheek against him caressingly, dozed off to sleep.|$|R
