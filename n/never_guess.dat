500|$|On May 3, 2013, just a {{month before}} the film's premiere, {{producers}} announced that Al Pacino had left the film over creative differences about how his character should come to life. At the time of his departure, Pacino's character had already been fully voiced and animated. Chris Renaud, co-director of the film, commented on Pacino's departure: [...] "So we don't want an unhappy actor, and we want something that is well-realized on all sides. If you don't see eye to eye, sometimes it's easier to (part company) and move on from there." [...] Benjamin Bratt, who had already been considered before Pacino, stepped in to voice Eduardo. Chris Meledandri, producer of the film, admitted that he was not [...] "aware of any of the major animated films of the last 15 years that has brought an actor in at such a late stage". Due to the finished animation, Bratt had to match his timing exactly to the character's mouth movement. Initially, during his five-day recording, he tried to imitate Pacino's voice, but found it impossible, saying [...] "no one can out-Al Pacino Al Pacino". He ended up only using Pacino as an inspiration, and resolved to go with his own interpretation of the character. His work was commended by Variety, saying: [...] "You'd <b>never</b> <b>guess</b> he wasn't the filmmakers' first choice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reviewing the Dreamcast port of Soul Reaver, IGN's Jeremy Dunham {{described}} Raziel's {{narrative as}} one of the most convincing he had ever heard, echoed later in the site's review for Legacy of Kain: Defiance, which described the series' cast as [...] "just damn good at talking like vampires, tortured souls and gods." [...] GameSpot included Soul Reaver in a 1999 list of ten computer games with the best voice acting of all time, stating about Bell that [...] "you'd <b>never</b> <b>guess</b> that the same person carried out all those voices", and of the cast [...] "there's not one weak link in the bunch, and together they create one of the best examples of voice acting in a game for PC or consoles." [...] In contrast, Douglass C. Perry of IGN felt Raziel's (and Kain's) dialogue in Soul Reaver 2 was overdone, stating that [...] "overwritten text makes them sound like caffeine-imbued English students verbally jousting in their first semester in college," [...] but liked the advancement and rebalancing of Raziel's personality and aggressiveness, and enjoyed his depiction, stating that he [...] "looks magnificently decripid [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film a 3.5 out of 4, saying [...] "It's {{entertaining}} as hell" [...] {{and it provides}} [...] "nearly non-stop action". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film a 3 out of 4, saying that [...] "the suspense is killer". [...] Henry Barnes of The Guardian considered World War Z an [...] "attempt at large-scale seriousness" [...] in the zombie genre, {{which resulted in a}} [...] "punchy, if conventional action thriller." [...] Writing for Variety, Scott Foundas thought the film to be a [...] "surprisingly smart, gripping and imaginative addition to the zombie-movie canon", which shows [...] "few visible signs of the massive rewrites, reshoots and other post-production patchwork." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter opined that [...] "Brad Pitt delivers a capable performance in an immersive apocalyptic spectacle about a global zombie uprising." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times said, [...] " [...] does not try to extend the boundaries of commercial entertainment but does what it can to find interesting ways to pass the time within them." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times remarked, [...] "World War Z plays a bit like a series of separate films and the juncture where the new final act was grafted onto the proceedings is unmistakable, but unless you knew about the film's troubled past, you'd <b>never</b> <b>guess</b> it existed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Carl's first episode, {{broadcast}} on 20 June at 7.30pm on BBC One, received overnight ratings of 6.64million, an audience share of 33.7%, while the BBC Three repeat, shown at 1am on 21 June, was watched by 210,000 people, 8.3% {{of the total}} viewing audience at that time. Jim Shelley from the Daily Mail reviewed Carl's first two episodes, and called him [...] "a fairly undistinguished presence {{in jeans and a}} grey hoodie." [...] Shelley sarcastically wrote that [...] "He was also (you'll <b>never</b> <b>guess)</b> a menacing villain. EastEnders hasn't had a new one of those for, ooh, weeks." [...] On making his way around Albert Square to discover Ian stole his cash, Shelley wrote, [...] "Perhaps surprisingly, Carl was also such expert psychologist he should have been a master criminal rather than the petty criminal he really is, or working in Harley Street. Within 24 hours, this led him directly to his money and allowed him to negotiate an extortion rate from Ian of £500 a week plus all the free portions of Jean's Sausage Surprise he can eat. [...] It was pretty impressive for two episodes. [...] It turned out Carl was Bad News. What other kind is there in EastEnders? [...] Carl worked his magic on Ian, assessing his character and weakness, and manipulating him to get what he wanted with the skill of The Mentalist." [...] He went on to comment on Kirsty's line, [...] "He's someone you don't want in your life", saying, [...] "Or in your TV show." ...|$|E
