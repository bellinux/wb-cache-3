There {{are two major}} techniques dedicated {{to deal with the}} voltage <b>balancing,</b> namely: <b>natural</b> and active voltage <b>balancing</b> techniques. <b>Natural</b> <b>balancing</b> is more preferable, since it does not require sensing and in-time controlling equipment.

40|$|The flying {{capacitor}} multicell inverter (FCMI) possesses <b>natural</b> <b>balancing</b> property. With the phase-shifted (PS) carrier-based scheme, <b>natural</b> <b>balancing</b> {{can be achieved}} in a straightforward manner. However, to achieve <b>natural</b> <b>balancing</b> with the harmonically optimal phase-disposition (PD) carrierbased scheme, the conventional approaches require (n- 1) x (n- 1) trapezoidal carrier signals for an n-level inverter, which is (n- 1) x (n- 2) times more than that in the standard PD scheme. This paper proposes two improved <b>natural</b> <b>balancing</b> strategies for FMI under PD scheme, which use the same (n- 1) carrier signals as used in the standard PD scheme. In the first scheme, on-line detection is performed of the band in which the modulation signal is located, corresponding period number of the carrier, and rising or falling half cycle of the carrier waveform to generate the switching signals based on certain rules. In the second strategy, the output voltage level selection is first processed and the switching signals are then generated according to a rule based on preferential cell selection algorithm. These methods are {{easy to use and}} can be simply implemented as compared to the other available methods.

40|$|Multilevel flying {{capacitor}} (FC) converters provide <b>natural</b> capacitor voltage <b>balance</b> under phase-shifted {{pulse width modulation}} (PS-PWM). However, <b>natural</b> <b>balancing</b> may not be robust enough to maintain the voltages at the reference values, especially under certain transient conditions. Furthermore, <b>natural</b> <b>balancing</b> dynamics depend on the load {{and it may be}} very slow in some practical applications. Therefore, a more robust balancing mechanism of maintaining the FC voltages at the desired values is required. This paper proposes a new closed-loop voltage-balancing method for the multilevel FC converters using PS-PWM. The proposed method balances the voltages of the FCs by modifying the duty cycle of each switch of the FC converter using a proportional controller. The crossed effect between FC currents and duty cycles is considered and is used for optimal FC voltage balancing.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of the <b>natural</b> <b>balancing</b> theory for the-cell case. It describes the relationship between the models for different numbers of cells in a generic model for a-cell multicell converter. The model discussed is based on the same principles that were used to develop the two-cell model in [16], except that the mathematics is much more involved. The same conclusions that were found to be true for the two-cell case was also found to be true for the general case of cells. These conclusions include that the <b>natural</b> <b>balancing</b> mechanism of multicell converters depends on the overlap of the groups of har-monics of the switching function as well as on the load impedance. It will also be shown that the self-balancing mechanism ensures safe operation under most operating conditions where a high enough switching frequency is chosen and the load is not purely reactive. Two new aspects of the balancing theory were identified in the-cell case: 1) for fixed duty-cycle modulation there exists certain values of the duty-cycle that causes the <b>natural</b> <b>balancing</b> mechanism to fail and 2) for-cell converters the balance booster concept can be extended to a number of balance boosters tuned to multiples of the switching frequency. A “DesignTool ” based on the balancing theory was developed to aid practicing engineers in designing multicell converters. Index Terms —-cell, two-cell case. I...|$|R
