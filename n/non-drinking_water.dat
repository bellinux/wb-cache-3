Water samples were collected and passed over a micro-column packed with acid treated active silica gel phase (pH= 2. 6) for adsorption of dissolved organic species under this pH-condition. Silica-bound-organics were then divided into equal portions followed by suspension into organic solvents of different polarities such as methanol, ethanol, butan- 1 -ol, ethyl acetate, diethyl ether and chloroform. These suspensions were then automatically shaken for 1 h at room temperature. The organic extracts were subjected to GC–MS analysis under temperature programming conditions. The mass spectrum of each eluted chromatographic peak was library searched or manually interpreted to identify the correct name and structure.

40|$|Manufacturing of {{perfluorooctanoic acid}} (PFOA), a {{synthetic}} chemical {{with a long}} half-life in humans, peaked between 1970 and 2002, and has since diminished. In the United States, PFOA is detected {{in the blood of}} > 99 % of people tested, but serum concentrations have decreased since 1999. Much is known about exposure to PFOA in drinking water; however, the impact of <b>non-drinking</b> <b>water</b> PFOA exposure on serum PFOA concentrations is not well characterized. The objective of this research is to apply physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and Monte Carlo analysis to evaluate the impact of historic <b>non-drinking</b> <b>water</b> PFOA exposure on serum PFOA concentrations. In vitro to in vivo extrapolation was utilized to inform descriptions of PFOA transport in the kidney. Monte Carlo simulations were incorporated to evaluate factors that account for the large inter-individual variability of serum PFOA concentrations measured in individuals from North Alabama in 2010 and 2016, and the Mid-Ohio River Valley between 2005 and 2008. Predicted serum PFOA concentrations were within two-fold of experimental data. With incorporation of Monte Carlo simulations, the model successfully tracked the large variability of serum PFOA concentrations measured in populations from the Mid-Ohio River Valley. Simulation of exposure in a population of 45 adults from North Alabama successfully predicted 98 % of individual serum PFOA concentrations measured in 2010 and 2016, respectively, when <b>non-drinking</b> <b>water</b> ingestion of PFOA exposure was included. Variation in serum PFOA concentrations may be due to inter-individual variability in the disposition of PFOA and potentially elevated historical <b>non-drinking</b> <b>water</b> exposures.

40|$|In {{cities with}} {{problems}} of aridity and {{a shortage of}} drinking water supply, there is an urgent need to establish alternatives for an adequate water management program. This study proposes an estimation through which users can select a rainwater harvesting system for <b>non-drinking</b> <b>water</b> consumption. For the cities of Pachuca and Mineral de la Reforma, State of Hidalgo, Central Mexico, the historical record of rainfall analyzed covers a period of 33 years (1980 – 2013). We calculated the monthly volume of rainwater harvestable from roof areas (VR, m 3) with household roof areas (Hra) of 45 m 2, 50 m 2, 100 m 2 and 200 m 2. It is proposed to replace in each single house the flush toilets and washing machine with ecological devices with consumptions of 4. 8 L/flush and 70 L/load, respectively. Furthermore, a maximum and a minimum consumption of eight and six flushes/day/person (flush toilets) and five and four loads/week (washing machine), respectively, are proposed. From these considerations, our estimations of the harvestable rainwater showed that households with Hra of 45 m 2 and 50 m 2 {{would depend on the}} water supply system of the public network during part of the year. On the other hand, households with Hra of 100 m 2 and 200 m 2 might be able to store enough water to meet other needs besides toilet flushing and laundry...|$|E

Material and Method: Both passive and active case surveillances were carried out in Mae Sot District, Tak Province {{since the beginning of}} the outbreak. Samples of various types of drinking and <b>non-drinking</b> <b>water</b> from the infected areas, communal waters, and some selected foods were analyzed for the presence of cholera contamination. A case-control study was conducted to determine the vehicle of cholera transmission among Myanmar migrants in one municipal community with a cluster of 72 cholera cases. Preventive and control measures were primarily carried out by trained migrant health volunteers and workers. Results: Between May and October 2007, 477 cholera cases of biotype El Tor, serotype Inaba, were identified in the district. The majority of them (93. 1 %) were detected by active case surveillance in the communities. None died in this outbreak. Most (84. 9 %) were Myanmar migrants and the remainder were local Thai residents. The infection rates of cholera were significantly greater in communities with known passive cases than in those with no such cases. Three samples of sea food illegally imported from Myanmar were positive for cholera of the same biotype and serotype.

40|$|This {{article is}} a brief review and summary of the {{estimated}} incremental risks (increases in hazard quotient or decreases in thyroid uptake of iodine) to pregnant women (and hence their fetuses) associated with perchlorate exposure in community water supplies (CWSs). The analysis draws on the recent health effects review published in 2005 by the National Research Council (NRC). We focus on the potential level of risk borne by the NRC-identified most sensitive subpopulation (pregnant women and hence their fetuses). Other members of the population should be {{at a level of}} risk below that calculated here, and so protection of the sensitive subpopulation would protect the general public health. The analysis examines the intersubject distribution of risks to this sensitive subpopulation at various potential drinking water concentrations of perchlorate and also draws on estimates of the national occurrence of perchlorate in U. S. CWSs to estimate the variability of risks under defined regulatory scenarios. Results suggest that maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) of up to 24. 5 µg/L should pose little or no incremental risk to the large majority of individuals in the most sensitive subpopulations exposed in the United States at current levels of perchlorate in water. The protectiveness of an MCL of 24. 5 µg/L depends, however, on whether the study subjects in the health effects data used here may be assumed to have been exposed to background (<b>non-drinking</b> <b>water)</b> contributions of perchlorate.

40|$|Maharashtra {{is among}} the few states in India that has enacted and {{implemented}} legislation to regulate the use of groundwater. The Act, known as Maharashtra Groundwater (Regulation for Drinking Water Purposes) Act 1993 stipulates inter alia, a minimum distance of 500 metres between a public drinking water source (PWS) and a well or a bore well of any farmer not used for that purpose. It provides for restriction of using pre-existing wells for <b>non-drinking</b> <b>water</b> purpose during certain times, empowers the Government to take over, remove the Water Extraction Mechanisms, and cut power supply or permanently close offending wells or bore wells. We find that in the most acutely water scarce area of Vidarbha in Maharashtra, there is wide, though imprecise awareness about {{the provisions of the}} Act. There is also a near complete absence of social support for the legislation. In fact farmers 'using their own water' are not considered as offenders even if their actions clash with the Act. The rural people as well as the office bearers of the Gram Panchayat appear reluctant and seem to be 'revengeful' towards those who are doing no worse than trying to earn incomes by using water for raising oranges. Instead of invoking the Act, people prefer to approach higher elected leaders and exercise pressure for creation of 'upgraded' drinking water facilities. Due to absence of this social legitimacy and the provision that unless the Gram Panchayat makes a formal complaint about violation of the spacing norm no action can be initiated, the Act has not been particularly effective in protecting the drinking water sources...|$|E
40|$|The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), {{an agency}} of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), {{formerly}} operated grain storage facilities at two different locations at Everest, Kansas (Figure 1. 1). One facility (referred to in this report as the Everest facility) was at {{the western edge of}} the city. The second facility (referred to in this report as Everest East) was about 0. 5 mi northeast of the town. The CCC/USDA operated these facilities from the early 1950 s until the early 1970 s, at a time when commercial fumigants containing carbon tetrachloride were in common use by the CCC/USDA and private industry for the preservation of grain in storage. In 1997 the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) sampled several domestic drinking water and <b>non-drinking</b> <b>water</b> wells in the Everest area as part of the CCC/USDA Private Well Sampling Program. All of the sampled wells were outside the Everest city limits. Carbon tetrachloride contamination was identified at a single domestic drinking water well (the Nigh well, DW 06; Figure 1. 1) approximately 3 / 8 mi northwest of the former Everest CCC/USDA grain storage facility. Subsequent KDHE investigations suggested that the contamination in DW 06 could be linked to the former use of grain fumigants at the CCC/USDA facility. For this reason, the CCC/USDA is conducting a phased environmental study to determine the source and extent of the carbon tetrachloride contamination at Everest and to identify potential remedial options. The studies are being performed by the Environmental Research Division of Argonne National Laboratory. Two phases of investigation were completed previously; this report presents the findings of the targeted Phase III investigation at Everest...|$|E
40|$|The United Arab Emirates (UAE) face {{a serious}} water problem. It {{has a very}} dry climate, high {{evaporation}} rate, combined with large water consumption from fast growing population, economic activities and uncontrolled uses of water for irrigation. Currently, UAE {{has one of the}} largest water footprints in the world. Groundwater is overexploited. Waste water is increasingly being treated to supply <b>non-drinking</b> <b>water,</b> but it still cover a small proportion of the demand. Desalination of sea water is the main source of potable water in UAE, but the high economic cost of desalination, its intensive energy demand and the adverse effects of its effluents on the marine life are a major concern. Other factors contributing to the problem are the focus of water management policies on keep supplying the growing demand for water, the increase of the per capita water consumption, and the free water charge for most of population. This research goal is to develop a water sustainability set of indicators for the challenging context of UAE. This paper presents the first stage of the research. Based on a review of the literature, the proposed framework involves 19 indicators, divided into four categories: water availability; water quality; water use efficiency; and policy and governance. Using an integrated cause-effect approach (DSR - Driving force, State, Response), the indicators were related in terms of their interdependencies, with a holistic view of the city water cycle. A preliminary test of the indicators to Abu Dhabi as a case study allowed an evaluation of the main 2 ̆ 7 Driving force 2 ̆ 7 on the system, such as the scarcity of water due to natural constraints of the region, and increasing water consumption patterns of modern society; an assessment of the current 2 ̆ 7 state 2 ̆ 7, which is under serious water stress.

40|$|Abstract Background Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA), a {{modelling}} approach, is used {{to assess}} health risks. Inputs into the QMRA process include data that characterise the intensity, frequency and duration of exposure to risk(s). Data gaps for water exposure assessment include the duration and frequency of urban non-potable (<b>non-drinking)</b> <b>water</b> use. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to compare household water usage results obtained using two data collection tools, a computer assisted telephone interview (CATI) and a 7 -day water activity diary, in order to assess the effect of different methodological survey approaches on derived exposure estimates. Costs and logistical aspects of each data collection tool were also examined. Methods A total of 232 households in an Australian dual reticulation scheme (where households are supplied with two grades of water through separate pipe networks) were surveyed about their water usage using both a CATI and a 7 -day diary. Householders were questioned about their use of recycled water for toilet flushing, garden watering and other outdoor activities. Householders were also questioned about their water use in the laundry. Agreement between reported CATI and diary water usage responses was assessed. Results Results of this study showed that the level of agreement between CATI and diary responses was greater for more frequent water-related activities except toilet flushing and for those activities where standard durations or settings were employed. In addition, this study showed that the unit cost of diary administration was greater than for the CATI, excluding consideration of the initial selection and recruitment steps. Conclusion This study showed that it is possible to successfully 'remotely' coordinate diary completion providing that adequate instructions are given and that diary recording forms are well designed. In addition, good diary return rates can be achieved using a monetary incentive and the diary format allows for collective recording, rather than an individual's estimation, of household water usage. Accordingly, there is merit in further exploring the use of diaries for collection of water usage information either in combination with a mail out for recruitment, or potentially in the future with Internet-based recruitment (as household Internet uptake increases). </p...|$|E
40|$|With a drying {{climate and}} {{increasing}} urban populations many cities in Australia are facing drinking water shortages. In Perth, tile capital of Western Australia (WA), summer water restrictions are common {{and in the}} face of declining rainfall the State Government is developing new water strategies. 0 ne strategy involves a closer alignment and integration of land use planning with water management. This will require residential land developers to look at tile total water cycle and how it fits into local aind regioinal water plans. Another strategy, currently being trialled in WA and the focus of this research, involves the development of wastewater treatment and reuse systems for <b>non-drinking</b> <b>water</b> applications, such as irrigating public open space, in urban villages. By treating and reusing wastewater locally, developers can work with local and regional water planners to help reduce drinking water demand, whilst ensuring environmental flows are maintained. In WA, two residential developments are installing decentralised wastewater, specifically greywater, treatment and recycling systems: Bridgewater Lifestyle Village (BWLV) in Erskine and Timbers Edge Residential Resort (TimbersEdge) in Dawesville, refer figure 1. Both sites are located in high population growth corridors and environmentally sensitive areas that experience high water tables due to their proximity to the Peel Harvey Estuary. Both sites are currently under construction and represent two different greywater treatment systems mid constitute the first trials of decentralised wastewater treatment and recycling within the Perth metropolitan area. BWLV {{is in the process of}} installing 380 greywater systems with a central overriding management system, with the treated greywater being used to irrigate the individual residences. Whereas TimbersEdge will have 260 homes connected to one central greywater treatment system, with the treated greywater then used to irrigate public open space within the development. This paper will discuss: the complexities of getting the systems approved, including the legislative and regulatory constraints: the maintenance and monitoring schedules required to meet the environmental and public health issues: discuss the community involvement required to ensure that the systems are accepted and that the residents feel empowered and confident with the systems: and briefly discuss how these issues have led to the development of a new management tool, known as the DeWaTARS framework. The development of the DeWaTARS framework will enable the development and application process of future applications within the Perth metropolitan region...|$|E
40|$|Fluorosis, both dental and skeletal, is {{a disease}} afflicting {{millions}} of people worldwide and is caused primarily by the ingestion of fluoride-rich drinking water. Usually, this is groundwater that has leached fluoride from underlying rock deposits. In West Ambrym. Vanuatu, however, the indigenous people live {{in close proximity to}} a degassing volcano and harvest rainwater for their potable water needs. The current project investigated two hypotheses; firstly, that dental fluorosis existed in West Ambrym and secondly, that it was caused by the ingestion of rainwater contaminated by the degassing volcanic plume. A dental survey was undertaken of children ayed 6 to 18 years using the Dean's Index of Fluorosis. A total of 835 children participated; 253 of whom came from the target area of West Ambrym. For comparative analysis and a more regional perspective, the remaining 582 surveyed were from other nearby locations. Drinking water, <b>non-drinking</b> <b>water</b> and food samples were collected for fluoride analyses. Dental fluorosis prevalence was found to be 96 % in West Ambrym, 85 % in Malakula, 71 % in North Ambrym, 61 % in Southeast Ambrym, 36 % in Tongoa, 43 % in an 'incidental islands' group, and 100 % on Tanna. Drinking water samples from West Ambrym ranged from 0. 7 to 9. 5 ppm F (average 4. 2 ppm F). Groundwater sources ranged from 1. 8 to 2. 8 ppm F (average 2. 2 ppm F). Of the 158 drinking water samples, 99 % were over the World Health Organisation recommended concentration of 1. 0 ppm F. It was found that pH was not a suitable proxy for fluoride concentration. That painted and/or rusted corrugated iron roofing {{may play a role in}} lowering fluoride concentration of stored rainwater was a tentative finding. Coconut juice was a rich source of fluoride. Food samples ranged from < 6 ppm F to over 100 ppm F. The current research has shown that the semi-continuously degassing of Ambrym volcano is introducing significant levels of fluoride into the drinking water of the local Ni-vanuatu. This geo-meteorological process has resulted in the development of widespread dental fluorosis in West Ambrym. The pathway of fluoride-enriched rainwater identified in this study has not previously been recognised in the aetiology of fluorosis. Defluoridation, or accessing an alternative water source, accompanied by modified rainwater harvesting practices, are means by which the prevalence of the disease can be markedly reduced...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{economic}} {{and population growth}} recently drives Maputo to become more metropolitan, with construction sector {{as one of the}} pillars to support its transformation. This progressive move is, however, hindered by one of the most crucial problems: water scarcity. Water is essentially required by construction sector, especially in concrete production. It needs a proper quantity and quality to meet the expected strength. While the quantity is determined by its ratio with cement, the quality varies for plain, structural and high-strength concrete. Drinking or tap water is commonly used in Maputo but previous experiments worldwide show that there is a possibility to use <b>non-drinking</b> <b>water</b> for concrete production. One of the emerging alternatives is treated sewage. This thesis aims to assess whether reclaimed water from the sewage {{can be used as a}} source for concrete production in Maputo in order to save tap water for domestic purposes. To determine water demand from the concrete companies, 156 concrete companies in Maputo and its surrounding, Matola and Machava, were listed and 11 of them were interviewed with the variance of locations, types of products, production methods, existing water source, number of employees, monthly water tariff, current practices and willingness to cooperate for a preliminary water reclamation project. The average amount of water consumption for 11 interviewed companies is 311 ± 36 m 3 /day and for the actual population of 156 companies is 4411 ± 257 m 3 /day. This value contributes to 12 % - 14 % from the total tap water use in Maputo. The water price is approximately € 0. 76 /m 3 for the small companies and € 0. 38 /m 3 for both the medium and large companies. The potential supply sources were investigated from different types, flow rates and locations, such as the outlet endpoints from houses, the wastewater treatment plant and the effluent from other industries. The influent of the wastewater treatment plant was considered the best source for the preliminary plant design with a flow rate of 5682 ± 1196 m 3 /day. Available standards worldwide and previous works were studied to find the safe ranges of water quality for concrete. Field and laboratory measurements were also conducted to provide preliminary information. The results were used as the basis for designing a treatment plant from the demand of 11 interviewed companies, with lower effluent quality than tap water, yet sufficient for concrete production. Recommendations of a large scale plant for all 156 companies were also presented. The system is designed as a modular scheme to provide different effluent qualities and potential changes, such as the increase of the influent flow rate, the option of combining the new system with the existing plant, etc. The system is divided into four phases. Phase 1, consisting of a coagulation tank (1 x 0. 6 x 0. 5 m), four flocculation tank (1. 5 x 1 x 1 m) and a dissolved air flotation tank (1. 6 x 1. 4 x 1 m), removes fat, oil and grease, phosphorus and suspended solids. Phase 2 removes remaining suspended solids by a rapid sand filtration (1. 50 m bed depth x 0. 56 m diameter x 5. 45 m height). Phase 3, comprising nine units of nanofiltration in one skid, removes dissolved solids to meet the demand of higher strength concrete. The last phase is disinfection which were excluded since the removal capacities from the previous phases are already sufficient. The cost of the design is divided into three packages depending on the expected effluent quality from each company. The basic package only consists of phase 1 and costs € 0. 30 /m 3. The intermediate package, comprising phase 1 and 2, costs € 0. 40 /m 3. The advanced package, consisting of phase 1 and 3, costs € 0. 80 /m 3. Only the price of the advanced package is higher than the actual tap water price. Pumps are installed before the units of rapid sand filtration and nanofiltration. Valves are incorporated to divide the flow for different treatment packages. The delivery of the effluent is performed by renting trucks since it is less expensive than constructing new pipelines. The design shows that producing concrete with reclaimed water from treated sewage is possible to be performed in Maputo and the sewage does not need to reach drinking water quality. It is the starting point to increase the availability of usable water and the opportunity of supplying tap water as much as possible for domestic purposes.
