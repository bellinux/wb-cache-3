5|$|Barbara Bach as Anya Amasova/Agent Triple X: A Soviet KGB agent also {{investigating}} the theft. Her attraction to Bond is cut short when she learns {{he killed her}} lover. Bach was cast only four days before principal photography began, and performed her audition expecting just {{a role in the}} film, <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protagonists.|$|E
5|$|Quinine wouldn't be {{successfully}} synthesized until 1918. Synthesis remains elaborate, expensive and low yield, {{with the additional}} problem of separation of the stereoisomers. Though quinine is <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major drugs used in treatment, modern production still relies on extraction from the cinchona tree.|$|E
5|$|The liquid thermal {{diffusion}} process was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enrichment technologies initially selected {{for use in the}} Manhattan Project, and was developed independently by Philip H. Abelson and other scientists at the United States Naval Research Laboratory. This was primarily due to doubts about the process's technical feasibility, but inter-service rivalry between the United States Army and United States Navy also played a part.|$|E

5|$|The {{value of}} the {{captured}} goods from Colombo alone amounted to more than £300,000. More importantly for the British, Ceylon was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonies returned to the Batavian Republic following the Treaty of Amiens which brought the war to a brief close in 1802. Britain retained Ceylon {{as part of the}} British Empire until independence was granted in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{learns that}} “Charlie” {{is in fact}} a {{reporter}} who is doing a story on Logan, and Logan punches him. Keith tells Harmony that her husband was not in fact cheating after all. Veronica obtains proof that another person, <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fraternity members, was with Claire the night she was raped. While retrieving Logan’s watch, Veronica learns that Logan actually has a half-brother.|$|E
5|$|Discovered in 1834 by Johann Friedrich Engelhardt and {{described}} {{three years later}} by Hermann von Meyer, Plateosaurus was the fifth named dinosaur genus that is still considered valid. Although it had been described before Richard Owen formally named Dinosauria in 1842, it was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three genera used by Owen to define the group, because at the time, it was poorly known and difficult to identify as a dinosaur. It is now among the dinosaurs best known to science: over 100 skeletons have been found, some of them nearly complete. The abundance of its fossils in Swabia, Germany, {{has led to the}} nickname Schwäbischer Lindwurm (Swabian lindworm).|$|E

5|$|He {{had little}} impact on {{the running of the}} navy, but he was {{interested}} enough in navigation and welfare at sea to sponsor the publication of John Flamsteed's Observations in 1704. He was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most colourful political characters of his day—he was content to spend his time building model ships—but he was a loyal and supportive husband to Queen Anne. Their marriage was a devoted, loving and faithful one, though beset by personal tragedy.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s, Cloverleaf {{tried to}} sell Rosecroft {{multiple}} times. In mid-2002, several buyers {{became interested in the}} track, but Cloverleaf was involved in lawsuits, so the track could not be sold. One bidder was Peter Angelos, the owner of the Baltimore Orioles, but he withdrew in 2005. All the lawsuits were resolved in 2006, and only one remaining bidder was left—Penn National Gaming. Maryland passed a casino bill in 2007, but Rosecroft was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locations sanctioned for expanded gambling by the law. As a result, Penn National lost its interest in Rosecroft and decided not to purchase the track. From the gambling revenue, 7 percent goes to the horse-racing industry.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, 2010, United States women's {{national}} team head coach Pia Sundhage named a 30-player roster for two matches against China in October. The roster {{would then be}} narrowed down to the 20-player roster for the 2010 CONCACAF Women's World Cup Qualifying tournament. The players would {{take part in a}} training camp before the two matches starting on September 20. Although Harris was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four goalkeepers on this preliminary roster, she was called into camp on September 23 to replace Hope Solo, who was recovering from a shoulder surgery. She was then named to the 24-player roster for the team's second match against China on October 6 in Philadelphia, although she did not dress for the match. She was not named to the 20-player roster for the 2010 CONCACAF Women's World Cup Qualifying tournament, but she did travel with the team to train.|$|E

5|$|Parmelly {{is blamed}} for the murders. The agents start to leave Florida, but Mulder soon pulls over. He remains frustrated, since Parmelly was on-duty during only one murder, and was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three men who knew Perry Simon's {{confidential}} identity. He also points out inconsistencies in the actions of Parmelly and Roque, who was also assumed {{to be part of}} the plot. Mulder believes that Parmelly was not responsible for the deaths, and that Neech had indeed been reincarnated to exact his revenge. However, Scully convinces Mulder that the case is over, and that they should return home. Just then, Brodeur passes them in his car. Looking in his rear view mirror, he sees Neech, who attacks Brodeur and causes his car to crash into a tree, claiming his last victim.|$|E
5|$|Pigs are <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main {{forms of}} {{livestock}} on Welsh farms {{though there are}} some specialised units. They used {{to be kept in}} small numbers on farms and by rural and urban cottagers. In the twentieth century, many miners in the South Wales valleys still kept a pig in a backyard sty, to be killed for production of fresh and salt pork, bacon, faggots and black pudding. In 2011 there were 25,600 pigs in Wales, less than half the number that were present a decade earlier.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{days after}} the Double Tenth, Bishop John Wilson of St Andrew's Cathedral {{was taken to the}} YMCA, and placed in the cell next to Elizabeth. He was {{severely}} beaten for three days before the Japanese accepted that he was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ringleaders in their imagined conspiracy. One night Elizabeth saw Rob Scott, by then badly disfigured {{as a result of the}} beatings and water tortures that he had been subjected to. At the end of one session Scott was told that he had been sentenced to death, and was forced to write a farewell letter to his wife. He was later sentenced to six years' imprisonment in Outram Road Prison instead, the site where convicted sepoy mutineers had been detained and executed by the British Army in 1915.|$|E

5|$|Shortly before writing Shakugan no Shana, Takahashi {{made his}} debut {{as an author}} with A/B Extreme, which was awarded an honorable mention in the eighth Dengeki Novel Prize by MediaWorks (now ASCII Media Works) in 2001. By his own admission, A/B Extreme was too {{difficult}} for readers to understand, so for his next work, {{he set out to}} write something easier to grasp. As such, the initial premise of Shakugan no Shana was to write a boy meets girl story in a school setting, though initially love was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> themes included. He was given the freedom to write as he pleased based on this premise after showing it to his editor.|$|E
5|$|The FBI arrives to take Marvin back to Ethiopia, but Marvin tricks {{them into}} taking Cartman instead. Cartman, who had {{previously}} cared little for the impoverished in Africa, is unable to bear the lack of food and poor living conditions there; furthermore, he attempts to convince the Red Cross there that he's <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Africans, but it fails. While praying to God in Addis Ababa, Cartman says he is sorry he made fun of poor people. He eventually finds a Red Cross shack, where Sally Struthers is hoarding all the food meant for charity. After a brief argument, Cartman exposes all of Miss Struthers's hoarding of the food supply to the Ethiopians, who then {{take control of the}} food supply.|$|E
5|$|The campaigns {{agreed to}} hold four debates. The first debate {{took place on}} March 2, between Tedisco and Murphy. The second debate, {{sponsored}} by WMHT and the Times Union, took place on March 19 between Murphy and Libertarian candidate Eric Sundwall. Jim Tedisco held {{a town hall meeting}} rather than attend, claiming the debate was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four originally agreed upon. The third debate took place on March 23 and the final debate was on March 26.|$|E

5|$|The thermal {{diffusion}} process was based on Sydney Chapman and David Enskog's theory, which explained that when a mixed gas passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier one tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter one at the warm end. Since hot gases tend to rise and cool ones tend to fall, this {{can be used as}} a means of isotope separation. This process was first demonstrated by H. Clusius and G. Dickel in Germany in 1938. It was developed by US Navy scientists, but was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enrichment technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project. This was primarily due to doubts about its technical feasibility, but the inter-service rivalry between the Army and Navy also played a part.|$|E
5|$|VERA is a {{light water}} reactor {{simulation}} written at the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors (CASL) on Jaguar. VERA allows engineers to monitor the performance and status of any part of a reactor core throughout the lifetime of the reactor to identify points of interest. Although <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first six projects, VERA was planned to run on Titan after optimization with assistance from CAAR and testing on TitanDev. Computer scientist Tom Evans found that the adaption to Titan's hybrid architecture was more difficult than to previous CPU-based supercomputers. He aimed to simulate an entire reactor fuel cycle, an eighteen to thirty-six month-long process, in one week on Titan.|$|E
5|$|With the Age of Discovery, rivalry {{developed}} between European colonies {{and the importance}} of cannon in naval warfare increased. Many merchant vessels were armed with cannon and the aggressive activities of English privateers, who engaged the galleons of the Spanish treasure fleets, helped provoke the first Anglo-Spanish War, though it was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main factors. A fleet review on Elizabeth I's accession in 1559 showed the navy to consist of 39 ships and in 1588, Philip II of Spain launched the Spanish Armada against England. In a running battle lasting over a week, the Armada was scattered and defeated by the English navy.|$|E
