50|$|The Namibian {{economy is}} {{closely linked to}} South Africa with the <b>Namibian</b> <b>dollar</b> pegged to the South African rand.

In September 1993, Namibia introduced its own currency, the Namibia Dollar (N$), which is linked to the South African Rand at a fixed exchange rate of 1:1. There has been widespread acceptance of the Namibia Dollar throughout the country and, while Namibia remains a part of the Common Monetary Area, it now enjoys slightly more flexibility in monetary policy although interest rates have so far always moved very closely in line with the South African rates.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2006. Capital {{flight is}} a serious problem for Namibia as well as other countries. If not addressed, it will {{continue}} to impede national investment, macro-economic management and economic growth. These issues are particularly pertinent to Africa in view of it is high incidence of capital flight in the presence of foreign exchange constraints, limited foreign capital flows, external indebtedness and high dependence on overseas development assistance. The purpose of the study is to determine the magnitude and determinants of the capital flight burden in Namibia for the period 1990 - 2005. The study consists of a literature review, identifying an appropriate model for the capital flight burden in Namibia, data collection, and estimating and testing of the model using secondary data from Namibia. The study adopts two approaches to measure the extent of capital flight from Namibia: the residual approach and the Morgan Guaranty Trust method which is modified from the residual method of calculating capital flight. The residual method is an indirect approach based on a comparison between sources of capital inflows with the uses of these inflows. This approach was changed by Morgan Guaranty to include an additional item, the change in short-term foreign assets of the domestic banking system. The estimates from the study indicate capital reversal from Namibia over the IS-year period, averaging U$ 88. 2 million using the residual method and U$ 200. 4 million using the Morgan Guaranty method. The findings, although different from the picture on the ground, create a very good base for future research on capital flight in Namibia, which tends to be more uniformly related to portfolio diversification. The results from the three main model variants are unequivocal and indicate that an increase in aid and concessional grants tends to reduce the capital flight burden, while on the other hand the burden is seriously increased by depreciation of the <b>Namibian</b> <b>dollar</b> and an increase in inflation. These results have important implications for the Central Bank and the Treasury in tenns of strategic economic policy reforms...|$|E

Shixwameni alleged rigging and claimed that his CoD faction represented the majority of the party; his faction went to the High Court to press these claims. On December 16, 2008, Shixwameni and 21 of his supporters announced their resignations from the CoD, but the faction led by Ulenga said that Shixwameni's resignation was invalid because he and five other party members had already been expelled on August 11, 2007. The Ulenga faction accused Shixwameni of [...] "revolting against the party and its democratically elected leadership by organising illegitimate parallel national structures against CoD structures, and by attempting to usurp the national leadership of the party" [...] following his defeat at the May 2008 congress. The Ulenga faction also said in December 2007 that it was suing Shixwameni and Nora Schimming-Chase to seek the return of about 260,000 <b>Namibian</b> <b>dollars</b> belonging to the party, which, according to the Ulenga faction, Shixwameni and Schiming-Chase had diverted and spent.
