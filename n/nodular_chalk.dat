50|$|In the {{southern}} province, the former Middle Chalk, now the Holywell <b>Nodular</b> <b>Chalk</b> Formation and overlying New Pit Formation, averages about 200 feet (60 m) in thickness. The sparse fossils {{found in this}} sequence include the brachiopod Terebratulina and the echinoid Conulus.|$|E
40|$|Flaser chalks {{consist of}} small {{ellipsoidal}} bodies or lenses of relatively pure chalk surrounded by clay-rich solution seams. The latter may be simple, individual clay partings or composite aggregations of clay partings. These flaser structures formed during late burial diagenesis {{in response to}} mechanical compaction and pressure dissolution of calcium carbonate. Dissolution preferentially affected the coccolith-rich, fine-grained matrix of the flaser chalks, leaving coarser skeletal particles largely unscathed; in addition, solution was most intense in {{those parts of the}} chalks which were originally most argillaceous. Variations in flaser chalks resulted when the above mentioned processes acted on and modified the products of early diagenetic lithification such as <b>nodular</b> <b>chalks,</b> intraformational conglomerates and incipient hardgrounds. True stylolites produced by pressure solution are present only in these early lithified chalks. The most probable range of burial depths at which flaser structure formed in chalks was approximately 300 - 2000 m. © 1977...|$|R
40|$|New {{petrographic}} {{observations and}} stable isotope data help reinterpret the complex sedimentology of the Albian–Cenomanian boundary exposed {{in the famous}} red and white chalks of the cliff section at Hunstanton in Norfolk, UK. Thin-section analysis of a prominent crust {{at the top of}} the Hunstanton Red Chalk Formation reveals fossil microstructures attributable to the microbe Frutexites. These Red Chalk microstructures are less bushy that Frutexites sensu stricto, and poor preservation, in part caused by later diagenetic iron migration, means they are identified only tentatively as Frutexites. Stable oxygen isotope values from the crust are similar to those from early diagenetic <b>nodular</b> <b>chalks</b> immediately below the crust, and to partially altered chalks elsewhere in Norfolk. The δ 18 O data are interpreted as Albian seafloor depositional values albeit slightly altered by subsequent meteoric diagenesis. The microbial affinities of Frutexites are not yet proven; thus, the presence of Frutexites alone is not diagnostic of either photic zone or deep-water sedimentation. However, the presence of Frutexites(?) suggests that the red colour of the Hunstanton Red Chalk is due, at least in part, to the mediation of iron-fixing microbes in the accumulating chalk sediment at a dysoxic–anoxic interface. Centimetre-scale columnar and nodular structures above the ‘Frutexites crust’ that project upwards into the basal Paradoxica Bed of the overlying Ferriby Chalk Formation are sites of localized syndepositional iron staining. These nodules are not stromatolitic or microbial and are not evidence for deposition in shallow-water or intertidal settings...|$|R
40|$|The {{petrographic}} {{and mechanical}} properties of flints from the Burnham (North Landing, Yorkshire, UK), Seaford (East Sussex, UK, and Dieppe, France), and Lewes <b>Nodular</b> (Mesnil-Val, France) <b>Chalk</b> formations have been investigated. Microtexture and mineral composition of flints are studied {{to understand how}} the geological and petrophysical properties of the flint affect drilling responses to the rock and investigate any spatial variation. The flints are categorized based on physical observation into white crust and light brownish grey, dark brownish grey and grey flints. Scanning electron microscopy shows textural variation in the classes. The white crust, light brownish grey, brownish grey and grey flints from the Burnham Chalk Formation from North Landing contain more calcite and have coarser, more poorly cemented silica spherules in comparison with similar classes of flint from the Seaford and Lewes Chalk formations from the Anglo-Paris Basin. In these latter flints, the structure is dominated by massive quartz cement with trace calcite independent of location. Strength tests show that the grey flints from North Landing are weaker than equivalents from the Anglo-Paris Basin. It is suggested that variation in engineering properties between grey and the dark brownish grey flints is caused by mineral composition, microtexture, structure and the local or site geology of flint materials...|$|R
50|$|Chilcomb {{lies within}} {{the heart of}} the Winchester anticline, an up-fold in the rocks with older beds exposed in the centre. This is {{surrounded}} by outcrops of successively younger beds forming an enclosing ring of steep hills broken only by the Itchen Valley. In the centre a valley running east-west from Chilcomb to Bar End lies on the Zig Zag Chalk formation, grey chalk of Cenomanian age. This is surrounded successively by narrow, elliptical belts of the much harder Holywell <b>Nodular</b> <b>Chalk,</b> the New Pit Chalk (forming St. Catherine's Hill) and the Lewes <b>Nodular</b> <b>Chalk,</b> forming the peaks of Twyford Down and Deacon hill to the south, Winchester's West Hill and Sleepers Hill to the west, Magdalen Hill Down to the north and Telegraph Hill to the east. Beyond lies a further ring of the Seaford Chalk.|$|E
50|$|Overlying the Selborne Group is the Chalk Group, a {{suite of}} limestones of Upper Cretaceous age which is {{formally}} divided into a lower/older Grey Chalk Subgroup (of Cenomanian age) and an upper/later White Chalk Subgroup (of Cenomanian to Campanian age). The Grey Chalk corresponds to the traditional Lower Chalk division and comprises 15-25m of the West Melbury Marly Chalk Formation overlain by 35-75m of the Zig Zag Chalk Formation. The White Chalk corresponds to the traditional Middle and Upper Chalk divisions and comprises up to 35m of the Holywell <b>Nodular</b> <b>Chalk</b> Formation, overlain successively by the New Pit Chalk, Lewes <b>Nodular</b> <b>Chalk,</b> Seaford Chalk, Newhaven Chalk, Culver Chalk and Portsdown Chalk formations. Each of these formations had 'member' status in earlier descriptions of the succession. There are marls present {{in some of these}} formations and bands of flint nodules occur to varying degrees in each of these units.|$|E
5000|$|The fold {{is around}} 35 km long, running from north of Michelmersh near the River Test to East Meon {{in the valley}} of the River Meon. In the Winchester area the core of the {{anticline}} has been eroded to expose the older Cenomanian Zig Zag Chalk formation in Chilcomb and Bar End (the 'Lower chalk'). This is surrounded by progressively younger rings of the Turonian Holywell <b>Nodular</b> <b>Chalk</b> and New Pit Chalk Formation (the 'Middle chalk') and the Coniacian Lewes <b>Nodular</b> <b>Chalk</b> and Santonian Seaford Chalk Formation ('Upper chalk'). This results in a near-complete ring of inward-facing chalk scarp slopes including Magdalen (Morn) Hill to the north, Chilcomb Down, Cheesefoot Head and Telegraph Hill to the east, Deacon Hill, Twyford Down and St. Catherine's Hill to the south. To the west, cut off by {{the valley of the}} Itchen are Compton Down and Oliver's Battery.|$|E
50|$|Located at the {{junction}} of Woodside Road and Grove Road, Woodside stands 546 feet above sea level. The underlying geology is a Chalk Group known as Lewes <b>Nodular</b> <b>Chalk</b> Formation and Seaford Chalk Formation which was deposited between 84 and 94 million {{years ago in the}} Cretaceous Period. The superficial geology is clay with flints, deposited in the Quaternary and Neogene Periods.|$|E
5000|$|The {{site is a}} large working quarry which exposes {{fossiliferous}} chalk {{rocks of}} the late Cretaceous, with many rare fossils including ammonites. It is described by Natural England as [...] "an unrivalled locality for stratigraphic studies in the Upper Cretaceous". It is a Geological Conservation Review site, and one succession of layers is the stratotype for the [...] "Kensworth <b>Nodular</b> <b>Chalk</b> Member".|$|E
50|$|The South Downs {{are formed}} from a thick band of chalk which was {{deposited}} during the Cretaceous Period around sixty {{million years ago}} within a shallow sea which extended across much of northwest Europe. The rock is composed of the microscopic skeletons of plankton which lived in the sea, hence its colour. The chalk has many fossils, and bands of flint occur throughout the formation. The Chalk is divided into the Lower, Middle and Upper Chalk, a thin band of cream-coloured <b>nodular</b> <b>chalk</b> known as the Melbourn Rock marking {{the boundary between the}} Lower and Middle units.|$|E
50|$|Twyford lies on {{the chalk}} at the {{northern}} edge of the Hampshire Basin, dipping south from the southern limb of the Winchester anticline. Successively younger layers of chalk are exposed from north to south, from Turonian New Pit Chalk in the Plague Pits Valley south of St. Catherine's Hill, the Lewes <b>Nodular</b> <b>Chalk</b> at Twyford Down, the Seaford Chalk under the village, to the Santonian or Campanian Newhaven Chalk to the south. In the Itchen valley to the west the chalk is overlain by alluvium and tufa deposits. The chalk is deeply incised by a series of dry valleys running south and west towards the Itchen.|$|E
50|$|Structurally, St. Catherine's Hill {{is part of}} the Winchester {{anticline}}. This is an upfold in {{the chalk}} at the western end of the South Downs. In the Winchester area the core of the anticline has eroded to expose older rocks in Chilcomb, Bar End and Winchester itself, leaving a near complete ring of inward-facing chalk scarp slopes including Magdalen (Morn) Hill to the north, Chilcomb Down and Telegraph Hill to the east, Deacon Hill, Twyford Down and St. Catherine's to the south and Oliver's Battery to the west. Whilst the highest part of the main ring of hills (which reaches up to 167 m at Cheesefoot Head) is of the 'Lewes <b>Nodular</b> <b>Chalk</b> Formation', St. Catherine's is of the slightly older 'New Pit Chalk Formation'. Both date from the Turonian stage of the Upper Cretaceous. St. Catherine's Hill is separated from the higher Twyford Down by the dramatic dry valley known as Plague Pits Valley to the east and south, and truncated by the valley of the River Itchen to the west.|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the Middle and Late Cretaceous stratigraphy at 170 localities in the Frome (Sheet 281), Devizes (Sheet 282) and Salisbury (Sheet 298) districts based on fossil collections and field observations. Nearly {{all of the}} localities fall within the Salisbury Plain military ranges, {{an area that has}} not previously been available for detailed geological investigation. Seven formations are recognised in the Chalk Group within the region covered by this report: West Melbury Marly Chalk Formation, Zig Zag Chalk Formation, Holywell <b>Nodular</b> <b>Chalk</b> Formation, New Pit Chalk Formation, Lewes <b>Nodular</b> <b>Chalk</b> Formation, Seaford Chalk Formation and Newhaven Chalk Formation. The large quarry at Beggar's Knoll, near Westbury ('Westbury Quarry' herein), provides a key exposure of four of these formations, from {{the lower part of the}} Zig Zag Chalk to the base of the Lewes <b>Nodular</b> <b>Chalk.</b> A single locality within the Upper Greensand Formation is also described...|$|E

40|$|Coastal chalk cliff {{instability}} is a {{major issue}} in the UK’s southern region. In order to further the understanding into what drives and influences chalk cliff collapse, a series of laboratory tests have been done on samples taken from West Melbury Marly Chalk, Seaford Chalk, Newhaven Chalk and Lewes <b>Nodular</b> <b>Chalk.</b> Tests have been done to find out if there is anisotropy in permeability, what the influence of weathering is on the tensile strength and what the influence of sea water cycles on the UCS strength is. No anisotropy permeability has been found. Significant weakening has been found due to progressive mass-loss from dissolution in vinegar. No weakening from salt water cycles has been found. Between the grey chalk and white chalk subgroups, big differences exist in the behaviour when exposed to weathering...|$|E
40|$|Numerous site {{investigations}} have described ‘reconstituted’, ‘putty’, ‘soft’ and ‘rubbly’ chalks which {{have generally been}} grouped together for geotechnical description purposes as ‘structureless’, to distinguish them from ‘structured’ (bedded and jointed) in situ chalks. Structureless chalks have mostly been assumed to be redeposited materials or materials that have been intensely mechanically reworked in place. They include sludge (Head), partially water-sorted (Coombe), fluvial (Dry Valley and Nailborne) and cryoturbation (Head) deposits. Recent surveys of the east Devon coast have shown that an extensive, thick chalk deposit, which in small exposures or in cored boreholes could be mistaken for redeposited material, has formed in situ by the partial dissolution of {{a particular type of}} chalk. The best exposures, in the cliffs at and adjacent to Beer, Devon [SY 230 890], show a 15 m- to 30 m-thick layer of partially decalcified, <b>nodular</b> <b>chalk</b> that is underlain and overlain by intact clay-rich chalks. The boundaries of the decalcified unit are stratigraphically controlled and sharply defined. It contains angular to rounded, granule to boulder sized litho-relics in a degraded, chalk-fines matrix. Blocks of intact, largely unweathered chalk up to tens of metres thick occur as detached masses ‘floating’ in the partially decalcified unit, and even larger masses have settled down into it. Some of these contain the youngest Chalk preserved in Devon...|$|E
40|$|In : International Coastal Symposium (ICS) : 2013 Proceedings (Plymouth, United Kingdom) International audienceAlong cliff edges, coastal {{managers}} {{dealing with}} life-safety matters often wonder "how much time have I got left before I need to expropriate this house?" Here, {{we present a}} case study where repeated terrestrial laser scanner surveys (TLS) were performed to monitor a chalk cliff section in Normandy. The Mesnil Val cliff, cut in Upper Cretaceous chalk known as the Upper Lewes <b>Nodular</b> <b>Chalk,</b> is a ca. 750 -m-long, 20 - 80 m-high cliff section. It was surveyed 6 times between December 2005 and March 2008 at a 1 -point-per- 5 cm resolution. Successive Digital Surface Models (DSM) of the cliff surface were subtracted to reveal the location and shape of erosion scars. Scars detection relies on a robust indicator of observed noise distribution. The resulting scar inventory contains more than 8500 objects with volumes spanning 8 orders of magnitude (10 - 4 to 104) cubic meters. Probability Distribution Functions (PDF) of erosion scar thickness, area and volume scale as power laws. The scaling relationships between area (0. 77) and volume (0. 53) power law exponents demonstrate that rockfall are simply scaled (area/volume exponent ratio = 3 / 2). This finding legitimates the inference of rockfall volume distribution from easy-to-measure area PDF. PDF can also be turned into complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) which then gives the annual rate of exceeding a given scar dimension. Our statistical estimates have been empirically validated with five complete cliff collapse events occurring on the same cliff section in 13 years. Repeated TLS surveys provide invaluable information to help coastal managers make informed decision...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} work {{carried out}} at Morestead, Twyford {{as part of a}} BGS research project “Nitrate Mass Balance in the Saturated Zone”. The project aimed to evaluate the role of the diffusive exchange of nitrate between fracture water and porewater in the saturated zone of the aquifer. The approach adopted attempted to obtain a mass balance for the catchment to a public supply borehole by comparing nitrogen released from the soil with nitrogen held in the aquifer and nitrogen pumped to an abstraction borehole. A new, cored borehole was drilled at Morestead, Twyford in an area of set-aside land on the margins of a field normally used for cereals. The borehole was completed to 75 m depth in the former Upper Chalk penetrating about 25 m of the Seaford Chalk Formation and about 50 of the Lewes <b>Nodular</b> <b>Chalk</b> Formation. The water table lay in {{the lower part of the}} Seaford Chalk. The core obtained was fractured but most of these fractures appeared to be to be parallel to the bedding (e. g. along marl seams) and were probably drilling-induced. Some high-angle fractures with mineralised fracture faces were found in the uppermost 10 m and mineralised fractures with slickensides (possibly associated with a minor fault) were observed at 31 m depth, a few metres below the water table at the time of drilling. A detailed profile of porewater quality was obtained by centrifugation of core samples. The results indicate that there do not appear to be any zones of unfractured chalk where porewater has retained pre 1960 s concentrations of nitrate. Zones close to major fractures did not show steep nitrate concentration gradients, suggesting that there were not large differences in quality between the fracture water and porewater. Porewater concentrations followed a typical nitrate profile for chalk overlain by arable land with elevated concentrations (up to 18 mg N/l) in the unsaturated zone and declining concentrations in the saturated zone (up to 9 mg N/l), except in a 15 m thick zone of the Lewes <b>Nodular</b> <b>Chalk</b> about 25 m below the water table. Here a number of marl bands appear to result in a zone of slow-moving water with low nitrate concentration, but elevated concentrations of a range of trace elements often associated with clay minerals and residence time, particularly Br, Co, Cr, F, Li, Mo, Sb and U. The results of packer testing of the borehole confirmed that the highest permeabilities were in the zone close to the water table, with low values at depth, consistent with results from boreholes in the nearby Candover catchment. Marl seams appear to be much more important than fractures in controlling groundwater movement to this borehole. Groundwater samples obtained during packer testing were all of similar composition and were interpreted as being drilling water which had not been fully flushed from the borehole before the test. The modelling step of the work was therefore not attempted as this required nitrate concentrations in the mobile water in the aquifer. The unsaturated zone porewater profile indicates nitrate concentrations mainly at and above the current drinking-water standard of 50 mg/l nitrate (11. 3 mg N/l). Annual mean nitrate concentrations at Twyford are rising towards 50 mg/l with seasonal peaks exceeding these concentrations. If this is representative of local conditions, and given the significant proportion of similar arable land in the immediate catchment of the Twyford boreholes then groundwater concentrations are likely to continue rising under the present landuse and agricultural regime. Moreover much of the cultivated land is located in the upper part of the catchment and the nitrate is likely to still be present in the unsaturated and saturated groundwater flow path. Even close to the Twyford borehole, the ‘improved grassland’ may have significant applications of inorganic fertiliser and organic manure. Present conditions do not therefore suggest any immediate reduction in the upward groundwater nitrate trend...|$|E
