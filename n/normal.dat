5|$|Across North America during La Niña, {{increased}} precipitation is diverted {{into the}} Pacific Northwest {{due to a}} more northerly storm track and jet stream. The storm track shifts far enough northward to bring wetter than <b>normal</b> conditions (in the form of increased snowfall) to the Midwestern states, as well as hot and dry summers. Snowfall is above <b>normal</b> across the Pacific Northwest and western Great Lakes. Across the North Atlantic, the jet stream is stronger than <b>normal,</b> which directs stronger systems with increased precipitation towards Europe.|$|E

5|$|During El Niño events, {{increased}} precipitation {{is expected}} in California due to a more southerly, zonal, storm track. During the Niño portion of ENSO, increased precipitation falls along the Gulf coast and Southeast due to a stronger than <b>normal,</b> and more southerly, polar jet stream. Snowfall is greater than average across the southern Rockies and Sierra Nevada mountain range, and is well below <b>normal</b> across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes states. The northern tier of the lower 48 exhibits above <b>normal</b> temperatures during the fall and winter, while the Gulf coast experiences below <b>normal</b> temperatures during the winter season. The subtropical jet stream across the deep tropics of the Northern Hemisphere is enhanced due to increased convection in the equatorial Pacific, which decreases tropical cyclogenesis within the Atlantic tropics below what is <b>normal,</b> and increases tropical cyclone activity across the eastern Pacific. In the Southern Hemisphere, the subtropical jet stream is displaced equatorward, or north, of its <b>normal</b> position, which diverts frontal systems and thunderstorm complexes from reaching central portions of the continent.|$|E
40|$|The {{value of}} digital {{systolic}} blood pressure (DBP) and flow (DBF) measure-ments for a quantitative diagnosis of Primary Raynaud’s Phenomenon (PRP) was evaluated {{by comparing the results}} obtained in 10 patients and 20 <b>normals.</b> Digital skin temperature (DST), DBP and brachial {{systolic blood pressure}} (BBP) and DBF were measured at room temperature, at maximal vasodilatation and during cold provocation.

Calculating digit to brachial systolic pressure indexes (DBI) a slight significant increase can be found during cold provocation both in <b>normals</b> and in patients.

40|$|Unsharp masking is a {{well-known}} image sharpening technique. Given an image and its smoothed version, amplifying high frequencies of the image via unsharp masking is achieved by linear extrapolation of the input images. In this paper, we adapt the unsharp masking technique for 3 D shape deblurring purposes. Consider a blurred shape represented by a triangle mesh. Usually such a shape results from a 3 D data corrupted by noise and then oversmoothed. First we apply unsharp masking to the mesh <b>normals.</b> To smooth the filed of mesh <b>normals</b> we use several local averaging iterations applied to the mesh <b>normals</b> (iterative mean filtering). Then we apply linear extrapolation of the original and smoothed fields of <b>normals.</b> Finally we reconstruct the deblurred mesh by integrating the field of extrapolated <b>normals.</b> We also give a quantitative evaluation of the proposed unsharp masking technique. To perform the evaluation, we use $L^ 2 $ error metrics on mesh vertices and <b>normals.</b> Experimental {{results show that the}} unsharp masking technique is effective for shape deblurring...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} decompose a field of surface <b>normals</b> (needle-map). A diffusion process is used to model the flow of height information induced by a field of surface <b>normals.</b> The diffusion kernel can be decomposed into eigenmodes, each corresponding to approximately independent modes of variation of the flow. The surface <b>normals</b> can then be diffused using a modified kernel with the same eigenmodes but different coefficients. When used {{as part of a}} surface integration process, this procedure allows choosing the trade-off between local and global influence of each eigenmode in the modified field of surface <b>normals.</b> This graph-spectral method is illustrated with surface <b>normals</b> extracted from a face. Experiments are carried with local affinity functions that convey both the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the surface, and an information-theoretic definition of affinity. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{technique}} for enhancing 3 -D shapes approximated by triangle meshes: high-boost mesh filtering.

An algorithm of the high-boost mesh filtering consists of affecting the high-boost filter to face <b>normals</b> on a triangle mesh and updating mesh vertex positions to make them adapt to the boosted <b>normals.</b> An enhancement operation is achieved by a procedure which subtract smoothed face <b>normals</b> from the original ones. To apply the high-boost filter to face <b>normals</b> on a triangle mesh, we require a low-pass filter for smoothing them. We use mean filtering applied to face <b>normals</b> in numerical experiments. The results indicate that the high-boost mesh filtering is a technique effective for 3 -D shape enhancement...|$|R

A novel joint probabilistic model is defined through two random fields to favor both intra field (within neighboring disparities and neighboring <b>normals)</b> and inter field (between disparities and <b>normals)</b> consistency. Geometric contextual information is introduced in the models for both <b>normals</b> and disparities, which is optimized using an appropriate alternating maximization procedure.

The surface <b>normals</b> are then regularised, by computing the weighted sum of the affinity evolved over time. Finally, the surface is reconstructed by integrating along integration paths that maximise the total affinity. Preliminary experimental results are shown for different degrees of evolution under the presence of noise. ...|$|R
