5|$|Harley's co-creator, Paul Dini, {{describes}} {{their relationship}} as Harley being someone {{who makes the}} Joker feel better about himself, and who can do the work that he does <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> himself. In the 1999 one-shot comic Batman: Harley Quinn, the Joker decides to kill Harley, after admitting that he does care for her, that their relationship is romantic, and that these feelings prevent him from fulfilling his purpose. Removing the traditional male-female relationship, {{such as in the}} Batman: Thrillkiller storyline where the Joker (Bianca Steeplechase) is a female and involved in a lesbian relationship with Harley, their relationship lacks any aspects of violence or subjugation.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, Sheridan {{was hired}} as an {{assistant}} writer for the sitcom Shaky Ground. During his time on the show, he also worked elsewhere as a freelance writer. Following that show's cancellation in 1993, Sheridan {{was hired as}} an assistant on the show Living Single, where he wrote four episodes. Sheridan was promoted to writer, and worked on the show until it was cancelled in 1998. Shortly after, Sheridan {{received a call from}} his agent, where he was told that the only show with an open spot was Family Guy, which Sheridan did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> thinking that writing for an animated show would end his career.|$|E
5|$|In couples' counseling, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{have been}} told to express {{appreciation}} for the things their spouse does for them, be frank about things that make them unhappy, and refer to anything they do <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but must as an opportunity. Their exercising of these three habits is stiff and formal to begin with, and becomes increasingly snarky as the day goes on. Despite this, as Jim leaves the office to return to his business, he confesses to Pam that he thinks the three habits are helping and that they should keep them up. After he leaves, Pam runs after him to give him an umbrella. Jim takes the umbrella, and then embraces his wife, who finds that she lacks the emotional conviction to hug him back. It then flashbacks to their wedding with Michael, Dwight and the gang, she remembers that by marrying Jim she promised to love him in spite of any hardships, and she lovingly embraces him and kisses him.|$|E

25|$|Hill's second {{film as a}} {{director}} was The Driver starring Ryan O'Neal as a laconic getaway driver for hire and Bruce Dern as a driven cop pursuing him. No character in the film has a name; they are merely The Driver, The Detective, and so forth. Hill originally had wanted to cast Steve McQueen, but he turned down the role because he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> another car film.|$|E

25|$|A sizable Sephardic {{community}} {{had settled in}} Morocco and other Northern African countries, which were colonized by France in the 19th century. Jews in Algeria were given French citizenship in 1870 by the décret Crémieux (previously Jews and Muslims could apply for French citizenship, but had to renounce the use of traditional religious courts and laws, which many did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do).</b> When France withdrew from Algeria in 1962, the local Jewish communities largely relocated to France. There are some tensions between some of those communities and the earlier French Jewish population (who were mostly Ashkenazi Jews), and with Arabic-Muslim communities.|$|E

25|$|According to Yuji Horii, {{he wanted}} to have {{something}} the player went around collecting as the previous Dragon Quest games had crests and orbs respectively. However, he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same thing over again by forcing the player to collect a certain number of items before they beat the game; mini medals instead {{have nothing to do with}} clearing the game. The promotional illustrations for the Japanese version was drawn by famed manga artist Akira Toriyama, whom provided the artwork for the previous games in the series and would continue to do so for every future installment.|$|E
25|$|West's {{next film}} was The Heat's On (1943) for Columbia Pictures. She {{initially}} did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the film, but after actor/producer/director and personal friend Gregory Ratoff (producer Max Fabian in All About Eve) pleaded {{with her and}} claimed he would go bankrupt if she could not help, West relented as a personal favor. Censors by now, though, had curtailed the sexual burlesque of the West characterization. The studio had orders to raise the neck lines and clean up the double entendres. This was the only film for which West was virtually not allowed to write her own dialogue, {{and as a result}} the film suffered.|$|E
25|$|CBS had {{originally}} planned {{on making the}} As the World Turns expansion {{at the beginning of}} the new season in September 1975. ABC's daytime schedule was full at the time, and the earliest they could have a spot open on the schedule would be December. This meant that it would be approximately three months at least before Edge would air its first episode on ABC and the network did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that. Instead, a compromise was struck. CBS would keep The Edge of Night on its schedule for the time being, and once ABC found a place for it, which it did when they cancelled You Don't Say! in November 1975, the expansion and network change would take place.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, {{long before}} the current {{transfer}} window system had come to English football, {{there was still a}} transfer deadline {{a few weeks before the}} end of the season. Arsenal, who had won the league in 1989, wanted to sign Seaman, but the deal involved Arsenal's keeper John Lukic heading the opposite way on loan. Lukic did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this, and the deal broke down and remained unresolved when the deadline passed. As soon as the season ended and clubs were allowed to buy players again, Arsenal manager George Graham came back for Seaman, with £1.3 million (at the time a British record for a goalkeeper) being the agreed fee. Lukic, who was highly popular amongst Arsenal fans, left to rejoin Leeds.|$|E
25|$|For {{some of the}} Indian tribes, the {{elimination}} of French power in North America meant the disappearance of a strong ally, although other tribes were not so affected. The Ohio Country was now more available to colonial settlement, due {{to the construction of}} military roads by Braddock and Forbes. The Spanish takeover of the Louisiana territory was not completed until 1769, and it had modest repercussions. The British takeover of Spanish Florida resulted in the westward migration of Indian tribes who did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> business with them. This migration also caused a rise in tensions between the Choctaw and the Creek, historic enemies who were now competing for land. The change of control in Florida also prompted most of its Spanish Catholic population to leave. Most went to Cuba, including the entire governmental records from St. Augustine, although some Christianized Yamasee were resettled to the coast of Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply does <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, {{who do not know}} what to do with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E
25|$|In Allen's opinion, {{the problem}} with Funny Lady was that Barbra Streisand had <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a sequel <b>to</b> Funny Girl and was {{determined}} to give the director, Herbert Ross, a hard time. Ray Stark had her cross-collateralized on three films and she was, figuratively speaking, escorted to the set every day {{by a team of}} lawyers. The picture does, however, contain some of Allen's most satisfying work, some of which she doesn't remember writing and just seems to have come out of nowhere.|$|R
