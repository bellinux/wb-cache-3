500|$|However, {{the scene}} where Littlefinger exposes his motivations while hiring two whores for his brothel was largely criticized {{as an example of}} the show's {{perceived}} abuse of conversations with prostitutes as an expository device, a situation for which Myles McNutt coined the term [...] "sexposition." [...] Aidan Gillen's acting was consistently praised and the comparison between Littlefinger's actions and faking an orgasm was considered apt, but many agreed with Meslow's statement that it was [...] "annoyingly overshadowed by the series' most gratuitous sex scene to date." [...] Among other criticisms were the scene's excessive length, the repetition of the dramatic approach, and the assumption that viewers were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> attention when presented with a long exposition that did not include sex.|$|E

[...] When Rice interjected, Boxer responded by saying, [...] "Madam Secretary, please. I know you feel terrible about it. That's not the point. I was making the case as to who pays the price for your decisions. And {{the fact that this}} administration would move forward with this escalation with no clue as to the further price that we're going to pay militarily... I find really appalling." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stevens {{had been}} with Charles Clasby's law firm for six months when Bob McNeally, a Democrat {{appointed}} as U.S. Attorney for Fairbanks during the Truman administration, informed U.S. District Judge Harry Pratt {{that he would be}} resigning effective August 15, 1953, having already delayed his resignation by several months at the request of Justice Department officials newly appointed by Eisenhower. The latter had asked McNeally to delay his resignation until Eisenhower could appoint a replacement. Despite Stevens's short tenure as an Alaska resident and his relative lack of trial or criminal law experience, Pratt asked Stevens to serve in the position until Eisenhower acted. Stevens agreed. [...] "I said, 'Sure, I'd like to do that,' [...] " [...] Stevens recalled years later. [...] "Clasby said, 'It's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> you as much money, but, {{if you want to do}} it, that's your business.' He was very pissed that I decided to go." [...] Most members of the Fairbanks Bar Association were outraged at the appointment of a newcomer, and members in attendance at the association's meeting that December voted to support Carl Messenger for the permanent appointment, an endorsement seconded by the Alaska Republican Party Committee for the Fairbanks-area judicial division. However, Stevens was favored by Attorney General Herbert Brownell, by Senator William F. Knowland of California, and by the Republican National Committee, (Alaska itself had no Senators at this time, as it was still a territory). [...] Eisenhower sent Stevens's nomination to the U.S. Senate, which confirmed him on March 30, 1954.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the lead}} of the US Army, in 1960 the Australian Army had {{replaced}} its former [...] "triangular" [...] divisional structure of three infantry battalions under a brigade headquarters, with a [...] "pentropic" [...] organisation consisting of five larger battalions without a brigade layer between division and battalion headquarters. This had the effect of reducing the total number of Australian battalions, while increasing their individual strength. Wilton was unhappy with the pentropic structure, reasoning that the number of battalions, rather than their relative strength, was the overriding factor when considering potential overseas deployments. The US had in any event abandoned the system in June 1961. In October 1964, Wilton commissioned a review that ultimately recommended a return to the triangular formation. In the meantime, {{as a response to the}} Indonesia–Malaysia Konfrontasi, the Australian government reintroduced conscription, which Wilton fought until convinced that the government was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> improve <b>pay</b> and conditions sufficiently to attract by any other means the recruits needed to meet overseas commitments. Wilton was keen to mitigate any prejudices the national servicemen might have against the regular soldiery, and vice versa; when he found a memo from an Army committee asserting that [...] "it must be recognised that the NS man was likely to be a reluctant soldier", he wrote on it [...] "This assumption not justified". In February–March 1965, following a request from the Malaysian government, Australia despatched 1Squadron, Special Air Service Regiment, and 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, to Borneo—a commitment Wilton felt able to recommend as a result of the recent decisions to increase the Army's personnel and battalion numbers.|$|R
