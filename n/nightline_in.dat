2500|$|The station {{traditionally}} aired syndicated programs {{following its}} 10:00p.m. newscast for many years, resulting in certain ABC late-night programs {{that the network}} recommended its stations air immediately after their late local newscasts being delayed to accommodate them. From its debut in 1980 until September 1983, WFAA delayed <b>Nightline</b> <b>in</b> favor of late-night movie presentations; the newsmagazine aired in its then-recommended 10:35 slot from September 1983 until September 1984, when it settled into a half-hour tape delayed airing after the station acquired the local syndication rights to Entertainment Tonight. As a byproduct of WFAA's swap of Nightline and ETs respective timeslots in September 1989 (placing the former back in its network [...] "live" [...] slot), Channel 8 aired Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher a half-hour later than its then-recommended 11:00p.m. Central timeslot from its ABC debut in September 1995 until its cancellation in December 2002; the talk show that replaced it, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, also aired in this manner starting with its January 2003 premiere (WFAA would begin airing Kimmel directly following Nightline, as intended by ABC, on September 12, 2011).|$|E

2500|$|Following Saddam Hussein's {{threats to}} light Kuwait's oil wells on fire in {{response}} to any physical challenge to Iraqi control of the oil assets, Sagan together with his [...] "TTAPS" [...] colleagues and Paul Crutzen, warned in January 1991 in the Baltimore Sun and Wilmington Morning Star newspapers that if the fires were left to burn {{over a period of}} several months, enough smoke from the 600 or so 1991 Kuwaiti oil fires [...] "might get so high as to disrupt agriculture in much of South Asia..." [...] and that this possibility should [...] "affect the war plans"; these claims were also the subject of a televised debate between Sagan and physicist Fred Singer on 22 January, aired on the ABC News program <b>Nightline.</b> <b>In</b> the televised debate, Sagan argued that the effects of the smoke would be similar to the effects of a nuclear winter, with Singer arguing to the contrary. After the debate, the fires burnt for many months before extinguishing efforts were complete. The results of the smoke did not produce continental-sized cooling. Sagan later conceded in The Demon-Haunted World that the prediction did not turn out to be correct: [...] "it was pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped 4°–6° C over the Persian Gulf, but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and Asia was spared".|$|E
