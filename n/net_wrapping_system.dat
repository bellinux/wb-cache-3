50|$|Mavželj (minced pork {{filling in}} net) is a {{national}} Slovene dish. It is known mostly in Slovene Carinthia and also in Upper Carniola. It is made of the soup in which the pork head was cooked, and of {{the remnants of the}} meat and the brains of the same pork head. The dish is ball-shaped and comes in various local variations. In the past, the preparation of this <b>net</b> <b>wrapped</b> ball called mavželjni was much more popular than today. Potters made special earthen baking moduls to fit their shape. The dish was mainly eaten on holidays.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical brake stretch {{wrappers}} are manual stretch <b>wrapping</b> <b>systems</b> which {{consist of}} a simple structure supporting a roll of film to be stretched and a mechanical brake which acts on the film roll, creating resistance to turning and stretching the film as it is fed out.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{combined}} experimental (Atomic Force Microscopy) and theoretical {{study of the}} structural and dynamical properties of nucleosomes. In contrast to biochemical approaches, this method allows to determine simultaneously the DNA complexed length distribution and nucleosome position in various contexts. First, we show that differences in the nucleo-proteic structure observed between conventional H 2 A and H 2 A. Bbd variant nucleosomes induce quantitative changes {{in the in the}} length distribution of DNA complexed with histones. Then, the sliding action of remodeling complex SWI/SNF is characterized through the evolution of the nucleosome position and wrapped DNA length mapping. Using a linear energetic model for the distribution of DNA complexed length, we extract the <b>net</b> <b>wrapping</b> energy of DNA onto the histone octamer, and compare it to previous studies.

5000|$|Small square bales {{are stacked}} in a criss-crossed fashion {{sometimes}} called a [...] "rick" [...] or [...] "hayrick". Rain tends to wash nutrition out of hay {{and can cause}} spoilage or mold. Hay in small square bales is particularly susceptible to this, and is therefore often stored in a hayshed or protected by tarpaulins. If this is not done, the top two layers of the stack are often lost to rot and mold, and if the stack is not arranged in a proper hayrick, moisture can seep even deeper into the stack. The rounded shape and tighter compaction of small (and large) round bales makes them less susceptible to spoilage, as the water {{is less likely to}} penetrate into the bale. The addition of <b>net</b> <b>wrap,</b> which is not used on square bales, offers even greater weather resistance.|$|R
40|$|GromacsWrapper is a python {{package that}} <b>wraps</b> <b>system</b> calls to Gromacs tools into thin classes. This allows for fairly {{seamless}} {{integration of the}} gromacs tools into python scripts. This is generally superior to shell scripts because of python’s better error handling and superior data structures. It also allows for modularization and code re-use. In addition, commands, warnings and errors are logged to a file so that there exists a complete history {{of what has been}} done...|$|R
40|$|Net- and twine-wrapped {{alfalfa hay}} bales were stored from July, 1990 to April, 1991 in three Kansas {{counties}} (Reno, Saline, and Stafford). Dry matter losses {{and changes in}} acid detergent fiber and acid detergent insoluble nitrogen levels during storage {{were not significantly different}} between net- and twine-wrapped bales. Although a significant difference in dry matter recovery between inside and outside bale storage occurred in Saline County, it was not considered important because all recoveries were high. No significant differences in ADF or ADIN increases were found between initial core samples and samples from the outer 4 in. of the bales at the end of storage. The minimal deterioration and weathering were probably due to below average rainfall (less than 14 in.) during the 9 - mon. storage period. <b>Net</b> <b>wrapping</b> is probably not justified on the basis of reducing storage losses in low rainfall areas...|$|R
5000|$|Extended core stretch {{wrappers}} are {{rolls of}} stretch film which have their internal core extended beyond their film roll creating a handle by which film can be wrapped. Extended core wrapping {{is the lowest}} initial investment stretch <b>wrapping</b> <b>system</b> as no machinery is purchased. This system provides little control over stretch and is hard on workers' hands. Because of this, many stretch wrap users opt for low cost hand wrappers such as [...] "hand savers" [...] or mechanical brake systems.|$|R

Initial experiments are auspicious...|$|R
5000|$|The added {{weight of}} the <b>wrap</b> <b>systems</b> must be {{included}} in static and seismic calculations. Fireproofing of the hanging system must also be considered. Regular maintenance must be considered, as cladding and wraps are not load-bearing and can be damaged during normal building or facility operations. Ampacity-derating may be mitigated {{by the use of}} purpose-designed intumescent or mechanically/electronically activated [...] "windows" [...] that permit heat venting. Like everything else in passive fire protection, all such methods are subject to stringent listing and approval use and compliance.|$|R
30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that CFRP {{confinement}} increased the axial resistance of the unheated column by about 40 % whereas the same <b>wrapping</b> <b>system</b> induced substantially higher effects when used to confine heat-damaged columns. Increases of 105 and 113 % in axial resistance of the CH 2 and CH 3 heat-damaged columns compared to control unheated specimens were encountered. This increased effectiveness of the FRP confinement when used to repair heat-damaged columns is attributed to the enhancement in lateral dilation of concrete after heating, which also increases with increased heating level or duration.|$|R

5000|$|Turntable stretch {{wrappers}} are a type {{of automatic}} and semi-automatic stretch <b>wrapping</b> <b>system.</b> A load is placed on a turntable, which rotates relative to the film roll, which is housed in a carriage attached to a vertical [...] "mast" [...] on which it may move up and down. In the simplest turntable systems, stretch is achieved by rotating the load at a speed in which the take-up demand on the load surface is faster than {{the rate at which}} the film is allowed to be fed, being limited by a brake system.|$|R
50|$|However, {{after many}} years exposed to the elements, the arch {{required}} restoration work to be undertaken; <b>netting</b> was <b>wrapped</b> around {{a part of the}} structure to prevent further tiles from dislodging. The Manchester Chinatown Community Group undertook a series of charity events, including a dry land dragon boat race in June 2012. In early 2013 the archway had been successfully repaired, with restoration work being undertaken by Manchester and Cheshire Construction Company.|$|R

50|$|The final {{commercial}} {{developments of}} <b>wrapped</b> cable <b>systems</b> {{took place in}} France in about 2005 when RTE, the national electricity transmission utility began to install substantial quantities of optical fibre cables including OPGW and wrapped cables. Two French contractors, Transel (part of the Bouygues group) and Omexom (a Vinci SA company), independently developed their own <b>wrapped</b> cable <b>systems</b> (known as câble optique enroulé (COE) in French) {{to participate in this}} program. Neither system had a product name other than COE or was marketed outside France. Both systems were withdrawn in about 2010 after a total of about 1000 km of wrapped cable installations for RTE.|$|R

Past {{studies have shown}} that RDB 2 RDF systems do not perform well, in other words, the execution time of a SPARQL query on a RDB 2 RDF system compared to its semantically equivalent SQL query is much slower. Therefore, we ask ourselves, what optimizations are needed in order to support effective SPARQL execution on relationally stored data? We experimented on Microsoft SQL Server, using the Barton and Berlin SPARQL Benchmark, and Ultrawrap, an automatic RDB 2 RDF <b>wrapping</b> <b>system</b> that has been architectured to leverage the SQL optimizer. Our initial results identify two important optimizations for effective SPARQL execution using Ultrawrap: detection of unsatisfiable conditions and self-join elimination...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the distinction between synchronous and asynchronous message passing the other primary distinguishing feature of message passing systems is whether they use distributed or local objects. With distributed objects the sender and receiver may exist on different computers, running different operating systems, using different programming languages, etc. In this case the bus layer takes care of details about converting data from one system to another, sending and receiving data across the network, etc. The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol in Unix was an early example of this. Note that {{with this type of}} message passing it is not a requirement that either the sender or receiver are implemented using object-oriented programming. It is possible to <b>wrap</b> <b>systems</b> developed using procedural languages and treat them as large grained objects capable of sending and receiving messages.|$|R
40|$|There {{are three}} main factors {{affecting}} {{the stability of}} a palletized load that is unitized by a stretch wrapping mechanism. These factors include the type of unitized load, wrapping configuration and shipping method. The wrapping configuration is determined {{on the basis of}} the type of unitized load and shipping method. For this study, the aforementioned components were referred to as the package, the product, and the distribution environment. These components come together to make up a stretch <b>wrapping</b> <b>system.</b> The package corresponds to the stretch wrap film that is packaging the unitized load and pallet. The product corresponds to the goods placed on the pallet to be packaged by the stretch wrapper. The distribution environment corresponds to the hazards that the packaged product will encounter in transit. This study was designed to observe and understand the interactions between each of the components of the stretch <b>wrap</b> <b>system.</b> Prior to stretch wrapping a pallet of product, the film is elongated or pre-stretched. The elastic nature of the stretch wrap forces the film to conform around the palletized load. It is hypothesized that the film force that the stretch wrap applies to the palletized load contributes to improved load containment. Hence, the objective of this study was to determine the existence of a correlation between percentage pre-stretch to change in film force and load containment. For the study, a range of pre-stretched unitized loads were subjected to ISTA 3 E distribution testing. Simultaneously the film force was monitored during the period of distribution testing. Subsequent to distribution testing, the load dispersion was quantified. The data obtained from this test suggested that there is no correlation between percentage pre-stretch and change in film force or load containment. The study also compared three methods of calculating pre-stretch: the marking wheel procedure, tapeless measure, and film cut and weigh. It was found that the most consistent method was the marking wheel procedure, followed by the cut and weigh procedure, and the tapeless measure procedure...|$|R

40|$|Microcontact {{printing}} is {{an emerging}} printing technique {{that could potentially}} find application in the electronics industry. High-speed roll-to-roll equipment was built at Nano Terra, Inc in 2008, for microcontact printing. However, the equipment was a proof-of-concept, capable of single-layer printing, while the industry requires a multi-layer printing capability. In addition, the quality of printing it delivered was not industry competitive. The existing equipment has thus been upgraded {{with a view to}} achieve high-precision multi-layer microcontact printing; including a new method to manufacture a flat stamp, design of a high-precision <b>wrapping</b> <b>system,</b> design of a five-axis positioning system, and modification of the impression roller. This thesis describes in detail the design of an innovative high-precision <b>system</b> to <b>wrap</b> the elastomeric stamp on the print roller.

As a result of the test observation, we found that the adjustment of the optical axis between PIR and the primary mirror was difficult with the initial design of the corrector alignment stage. Furthermore, the optical axis of the telescope moved over a little owing to an earthquake in Hawaii Island in Oct. 2006. Therefore we decided to modify mechanical structure of PIR, the corrector alignment stage as well as the cable <b>wrapping</b> <b>system.</b> This modification was completed in the summer of 2007.
