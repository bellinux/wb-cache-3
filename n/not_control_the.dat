5|$|Dr. Robert Roswell, a {{previous}} VA Undersecretary of Health and now Professor of Medicine at the University of Oklahoma, said that an appropriate measure of VHA performance was not patient wait times, which were largely outside {{the control of}} the staff, because VHA employees do <b>not</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> number of patients seeking care. A better measure of performance, would for example, measure the efficient use of VHA resources, such as the number of no-show appointments.|$|E
5|$|Gough Whitlam's Labor {{government}} {{was elected in}} 1972 after 23 years of rule by a coalition formed by the Liberal and Country parties. The ALP Government enjoyed a nine-seat majority in the House of Representatives, but did <b>not</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> Senate. In accordance with pre-election promises, it instituted {{a large number of}} policy changes, and offered much legislation. The Opposition, which still controlled the Senate, allowed some Government bills to pass the Senate, and blocked others.|$|E
5|$|The heart {{receives}} nerve {{signals from}} the vagus nerve and from nerves arising from the sympathetic trunk. These nerves act to influence, but <b>not</b> <b>control,</b> <b>the</b> heart rate. Sympathetic nerves also influence the force of heart contraction. Signals that travel along these nerves arise from two paired cardiovascular centres in the medulla oblongata. The vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system acts to decrease the heart rate, and nerves from the sympathetic trunk act to increase the heart rate. These nerves form a network of nerves that lies over the heart called the cardiac plexus.|$|E

5|$|The {{struggle}} {{lasted for}} {{over four years}} and involved sporadic but bloody armed conflict, internal Indonesian political and communal upheavals, and two major international diplomatic interventions. Dutch military forces (and, for a while, {{the forces of the}} World War II Allies) were able to control the major towns, cities and industrial assets in Republican heartlands on Java and Sumatra, but could <b>not</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> countryside. In 1949 international pressure on the Netherlands became such that, together with the existing partial military stalemate, it recognised Indonesian independence.|$|E
5|$|Demosthenes was {{determined}} to prevent the capture of the city, and went on an embassy to Byzantion, which agreed to form an alliance with Athens. The Athenians general Chares {{was already in the}} vicinity with 40 ships, and was sent to support Byzantion; furthermore, Byzantion's other allies, Chios, Rhodes and Kos also sent aid to the city. Since he still did <b>not</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> seas, Philip already faced a difficult task to besiege Byzantion, made all the more difficult by the outside support. Again, Philip's engineers set to work, and created a breach; a night assault was then made, but was repulsed. Frustrated in the two sieges, Philip now lost patience with the Athenians, and wrote to them, declaring war. In Athens, Demosthenes proposed that the Athenians should respond by declaring war on Philip; the motion was passed, and the stone tablet recording the peace of Philocrates destroyed. The Athenians prepared another fleet under the command of Phocion, and dispatched it to Byzantion.|$|E
5|$|No German {{team was}} allowed at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London or the Winter Games in St. Moritz. Brundage {{was anxious to}} reintegrate Germany into the Olympic {{movement}} once the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany, through Brundage's lifetime) was formed in 1949. Soon after the state's formation, its National Olympic Committee approached the IOC, seeking recognition, {{but there was still}} much animus towards Germany. Just prior to the IOC session in Vienna in 1951 (Brundage was still vice president), the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) also formed an NOC and requested recognition. This created controversy, as the Federal Republic and its NOC claimed to represent both West and East Germany, but did <b>not</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> latter. Despite lengthy discussions, no resolution was reached in 1951, and the matter was put over until February 1952, when a negotiating session was scheduled for Copenhagen. Although the East Germans came to Copenhagen, they refused to attend the session, which was eventually cancelled by Edström after the IOC officials and West Germans waited for hours in vain. The German team which competed in Helsinki that summer was entirely West German.|$|E

5|$|On 15 November at 6:42a.m., the Kaštela TG {{commenced}} a naval {{bombardment of}} targets in Split {{and on the}} islands of Brač and Šolta. The order was issued aboard VPBR-31 Split and the JNA Maritime Military Sector command and JNA bases in Split were advised of the attack. The JNA based in Split did not join the bombardment. Letica notified the JNA Maritime Military Sector commanding officer Major General Nikola Mladenić of the attack, but Mladenić said he could <b>not</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> situation because his headquarters was denied a supply of electricity. The European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM) was also notified; they promised to make efforts to stop the bombardment. Shortly after, Letica ordered the coastal artillery to commence fire against the Kaštela TG. Besides several near-misses, the coastal artillery fire scored a direct hit against VPBR-31 Split, that was attributed to the Marinča Rat-based battery on Šolta. Croatian sources said Mladenić ordered the bombardment in retribution {{for the loss of}} Mukos.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{treaties}} were signed, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, acting {{in his capacity}} as US Indian agent, visited La Pointe. He reprimanded Buffalo for not stopping the continuing sporadic warfare between the Ojibwa and Dakota. Buffalo replied that he was unable to stop the young men of Lac Courte Oreilles, St. Croix, Lac du Flambeau or other bands beyond La Pointe from going against the Dakota. Historians take this to mean that while he was regarded as the head spokesman of the Ojibwa in Wisconsin, he could <b>not</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> day-to-day affairs of all the bands, which were highly decentralized, particularly about warfare. Buffalo also said that, unlike the British before the War of 1812, the U.S. Government had not done enough to help maintain the peace among the tribes.|$|E
5|$|The WWF World Heavyweight Championship {{match was}} next, in which Diesel defended the title against Bret Hart. Diesel began the match by clotheslining Hart, but Hart gained the {{advantage}} {{by focusing on}} injuring Diesel's knee. He performed the figure four leglock twice before attacking Diesel outside the ring. Diesel regained the advantage by using his size and strength to throw Hart and perform power moves to wear him down. Hart tied Diesel's legs to the ring post {{with a piece of}} tape and kicked him repeatedly. Diesel recovered and performed the Jackknife power bomb on Hart. Before the referee could count the pinfall, Shawn Michaels ran to the ring and attacked Diesel. The referee ordered the match to continue, and the match went back and forth until Hart used the Sharpshooter submission hold to place pressure on Diesel's injured leg. Owen Hart interfered by attacking Bret, but the match was ordered to continue. Bret Hart and Diesel brawled until Bret rolled Diesel up for a pinfall. The referee was knocked unconscious, and Michaels, Jarrett, and The Roadie came to the ring to attack Diesel. Meanwhile, Owen Hart and Bob Backlund attacked Bret Hart. Because the referee could <b>not</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> match, it was declared a draw and Diesel retained his championship.|$|E

5|$|The debacle at Kasserine Pass {{strained}} {{relations between}} the Allies, and another crisis developed when II Corps reported that enemy aviation was operating at will over its sector because of an absence of Allied air cover. This elicited a scathing response from British Air Marshal Arthur Coningham on the competence of American troops. Eisenhower drafted a letter to Marshall suggesting that Coningham should be relieved of his command since he could <b>not</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> acrimony between senior Allied commanders, but Smith persuaded him not to send it. Instead, Air Chief Marshal Arthur Tedder, Major General Carl Spaatz, and Brigadier General Laurence S. Kuter paid Patton a visit at his headquarters. Their meeting {{was interrupted by a}} German air raid that convinced the airmen that General Patton had a point. Coningham withdrew his written criticisms and he apologized.|$|E

25|$|Accounts of the Spanish conquistadores {{show the}} Muisca had a highly {{advanced}} and specialised economy {{based on a}} variety of sources of income.

25|$|Whitlam's {{radical and}} {{imperious}} style eventually alienated many voters, {{and some of}} the state governments were openly hostile to his government. As it did <b>not</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> senate, much of its legislation was rejected or amended. The Queensland Country Party government of Joh Bjelke-Petersen had particularly bad relations with the Federal government. Even after it was re-elected at elections in May 1974, the Senate remained an obstacle to its political agenda. At the only joint sitting of parliament, in August 1974, six keys pieces of legislation were passed.|$|E
