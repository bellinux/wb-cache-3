5|$|Beginning with Intel Kaby Lake and AMD Bristol Ridge, Windows 10 is {{the only}} version of Windows that Microsoft will officially support on newer CPU microarchitectures. Terry Myerson stated that Microsoft did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> further {{investments}} in optimizing older versions of Windows and associated software for newer generations of processors. These policies were criticized by the media, who especially noted that Microsoft was refusing to support newer hardware (particularly Intel's Skylake CPUs, which was also originally targeted by the new policy with a premature end of support that was ultimately retracted) on Windows 8.1, a version of Windows that is still in mainstream support until January 2018.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Nimoy was not {{originally}} {{considered for}} the role as the celebrity at the maiden voyage of the monorail, as the writing staff did not think he would accept, because William Shatner had previously turned the show down. Instead, George Takei was asked to guest star as he had appeared on the show once before. After demanding several script changes, Takei declined, saying he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> fun of public transportation as {{he was a member}} of the board of directors of the Southern California Rapid Transit District (now the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority). As a result, the staff went to Nimoy, who accepted.|$|E
5|$|The album's cover was, like {{several other}} Pink Floyd albums, {{designed}} by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. It {{consists of a}} photograph of a man sitting in a tree which has been taken out of focus to the point of complete distortion. Hipgnosis viewed a number of stills from the film on a 35mm projector, and liked the visual effect when the slide jammed. Schroeder later said the band did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the cover particularly good as The Dark Side of the Moon would have to compete with it, but Thorgerson insisted it was given proper consideration like any other Floyd album.|$|E

5|$|Steven Soderbergh {{had been}} {{interested}} in making a film about the drug wars for some time but did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> one about addicts. Producer Laura Bickford obtained {{the rights to the}} United Kingdom mini-series Traffik (1989) and liked its structure. Soderbergh, who had seen the mini-series in 1990, started looking for a screenwriter to adapt it into a film. They read a script by Stephen Gaghan called Havoc, about upper-class white kids in Palisades High School doing drugs and getting involved with gangs. Soderbergh approached Gaghan to work on his film, but found he was already working for producer/director Edward Zwick. Bickford and Soderbergh approached Zwick, who agreed to merge the two projects and come aboard as a producer.|$|E
5|$|For grieving {{parents who}} form {{emotional}} bonds with reborn dolls, some child bereavement counselors advise against parents substituting their deceased child with the dolls. Reborn mothers contend {{that they are}} not replacing children but remembering them. Psychiatrist Sue Varma, teacher at the NYU school of medicine, says mothering reborn dolls rather than just collecting them can become a problem when it is used as prop and becomes the person's only form of socializing. Psychiatrist Gail Saltz with New York Presbyterian Hospital supports the use of reborns for people who do <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the commitment of having a real child, and also to comfort bereaved parents. She offers that in this case the reborn may symbolize a step in the grieving process. Concern should only come if someone who lost a baby grows too attached to their reborn because it could indicate their grief is not getting resolved. In this case, the likeness of the doll to the deceased child risks being harmful as a permanent replacement for the grieving parents. Ian James, a doctor at the Centre for the Health of the Elderly at Newcastle General Hospital in the U.K., said that holding the dolls helps calm elderly residents, helping them feel peaceful and quiet.|$|E

This could be of particular importance if there are competing motives (e.g., one’s own safety vs. property attachment).|$|R

25|$|The {{original}} {{focus of}} the series {{was intended to be}} the relationship between Frasier and Martin, and it was the focus of most of the first-season episodes. Once the show began airing, Niles became a breakout character, and more focus was added to the brothers' relationship, and other plots centering on Niles, starting in the second season. The producers initially did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Niles' wife Maris an unseen character because {{they did not want to}} draw parallels to Vera, Norm's wife on Cheers. They originally intended that she would appear after several episodes, but were enjoying writing excuses for her absence that eventually it was decided she would remain unseen, and after the increasingly eccentric characteristics ascribed to her, no real actress could portray her.|$|E

While he was in Los Angeles, Claes Elefalk urged Ljungberg to meet with Joe Roth, a Hollywood {{producer}} and majority stakeholder in the MLS Expansion Team Seattle Sounders. Ljungberg secretly met with Roth but did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> any rash decisions. At the same time, there were rumors of four Italian clubs being interested in Ljungberg including Lazio, Milan, Roma, and Fiorentina. By the end of August, Ljungberg was linked to Portsmouth.

Songwriter Thom Yorke said: [...] "Even with electronics, {{there is an element}} of spontaneous performance in using them. It was the tension between what's human and what's coming from the machines. That was stuff we were getting into."
