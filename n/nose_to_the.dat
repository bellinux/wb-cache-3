5|$|The Alpine {{was a large}} {{breed of}} spaniel, {{described}} as reaching two feet at the withers and six feet from the <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tail. It had a closely set coat, curlier {{than that of the}} English Cocker Spaniel or the English Springer Spaniel. An intelligent breed, it was particularly adapted to the climate of the Swiss Alps.|$|E
5|$|The head {{is small}} and streamlined, adding to the agility of the cheetah. Saharan cheetah have narrow canine faces. Small, short, and rounded, the ears are marked by black patches on the back; the edges and base of the ears are tawny. The high-set eyes have round pupils. The whiskers, shorter and fewer in number than those of other felids, are fine and inconspicuous. The {{pronounced}} tear streaks are unique to the cheetah. These streaks originate {{from the corner of}} the eyes and run down the <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mouth. Their role is obscurethey may be serving as a shield for the eyes against the sun's glare, a helpful feature as the cheetah hunts mainly during the day; another purpose could be to define facial expressions.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} the rhinarium {{does not have any}} {{olfactory}} receptors, so it is not used for smell in terms of detecting volatile substances. Instead, it has sensitive touch receptors (Merkel cells). The rhinarium, upper lip, and gums are tightly connected by a fold of mucous membrane called the philtrum, which runs from the tip of the <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mouth. The upper lip is constrained by this connection and has fewer nerves to control movement, which leaves it less mobile than the upper lips of simians. The philtrum creates a gap (diastema) between the roots of the first two upper incisors.|$|E
50|$|In {{anterior}} rhinoscopy, the rhinoscope is advanced through <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> examine <b>the</b> nasal cavity.|$|R
50|$|Chilesaurus {{measured}} roughly 3.2 m from <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> tail. <b>The</b> holotype is {{a smaller}} individual of half that length.|$|R
50|$|Inside the {{circular}} Gorilla Sanctuary, visitors are separated only by glass and can get <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> <b>nose</b> with <b>the</b> gorillas. And {{there are several}} different outdoor vantage points from which <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> gorillas playing and relaxing.|$|R
5|$|The Ilyushin Il-40 (NATO {{reporting}} name: Brawny) was a two-seat Soviet jet-engined armored ground-attack aircraft. The first prototype flew in 1953 and {{was very}} successful except when it fired its guns, as their combustion gasses disturbed the airflow into the engines and caused them to flameout or hiccup. Remedying this problem took over a year and involved the radical change of moving the engine air intakes {{all the way to}} the very front of the aircraft and repositioning the guns from the tip of the <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the fuselage, just behind the nosewheel. The aircraft, now resembling a double-barreled shotgun from the front, was ordered into production in 1955. Only five production aircraft had been completed before the entire program was canceled in early 1956 when the VVS discarded its close air-support doctrine in favor of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield.|$|E
25|$|The Dipper was a {{conversion}} of a Cessna 150, adding a fiberglass hull and <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cessna land plane. Development was protracted and started in 1964, {{leading to a}} first flight in 1982.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in the day, astronauts {{carried out}} the Shuttle Exhaust Ion Turbulence Experiments (SEITE) burn. The burn was radial down (<b>nose</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earth) such that the burn plume was {{observed}} by the orbiting C/NOFS satellite. Later, the Shuttle Ionospheric Modification with Pulsed Localized Exhaust Experiments (SIMPLEX) burn was conducted, with the burn plume observed by the Arecibo ground station.|$|E
50|$|Menpō {{covered the}} face from <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chin.|$|R
25|$|Kfir TC.2: A two-seat {{training}} variant {{developed from}} the C.2. It has a longer and lowered <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> improve <b>the</b> pilot's view.|$|R
50|$|The Germans {{once again}} {{attacked}} the line, {{this time with}} air support. The Dutch naval artillery continued shelling their perimeter, forcing <b>the</b> Germans <b>to</b> keep their <b>noses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground until the artillery gradually decreased its fire. It was enough time for <b>the</b> Dutch <b>to</b> evacuate their troops in the northern sector and cross the bridge over the Postbrug canal.|$|R
25|$|After {{rebuilding}} the locomotives did not retain their numbers, {{for example the}} first locomotive converted was CL2 which emerged as CLF1. All were back in service {{by the end of}} 1993. The CLFs appeared in the standard Australian National green with yellow data panel, strip and B-end. The CLPs received a unique livery, with a lighter green nose, silver carbody, and a yellow stripe running from the <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear.|$|E
25|$|The lower wings were {{mounted on}} the top of a flat bottomed, single-stepped hull with flat sides which tapered in profile toward the rear. The wings were further braced to the hull by a pair of struts {{reaching}} back from the <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> centre wing leading edge. The nose also had raised decking protecting of the pilot, who sat in the front of the open cockpit with a passenger seat behind him.|$|E
25|$|In 1793, François Chopart {{performed}} operative procedure on a lip using a flap {{from the}} neck. In 1814, Joseph Carpue successfully performed operative procedure on a British military {{officer who had}} lost his <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> toxic effects of mercury treatments. In 1818, German surgeon Carl Ferdinand von Graefe published his major work entitled Rhinoplastik. Von Graefe modified the Italian method using a free skin graft from the arm instead of the original delayed pedicle flap.|$|E
2500|$|A P-38L was {{modified}} by Hindustan Aeronautics in India as a fast VIP transport, with a comfortable {{seat in the}} nose, leather-lined walls, accommodations for refreshments and a glazed <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> give <b>the</b> passenger a spectacular view.|$|R
25|$|The white race, with oval face, {{straight}} hair and <b>nose,</b> <b>to</b> which <b>the</b> civilised people of Europe belong and which appear <b>to</b> us <b>the</b> most beautiful of all, is also superior to others by its genius, courage, and activity.|$|R
50|$|Like other procyonids, coatis are omnivores. Their diet {{consists}} {{largely of}} insects (including their larvae), spiders and other invertebrates {{as well as}} the occasional small vertebrate discovered while energetically foraging, with their sensitive <b>noses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, in forest leaf litter. On Barro Colorado Island, Panama, where they have been studied in greatest detail, they supplement this diet with copious amounts of fruit as it becomes available seasonally from favored trees, such as figs (Ficus insipida) and hog plums (Spondias mombin).|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} hit {{the water}} with the tail first. The impact caused the fuselage to break into three main parts. The largest was the 26-meter (85ft) forward section of the aircraft, from the <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trailing edge of the wings. It remained afloat after the accident for about twenty hours. The midsection was 13meters (42ft) long, from {{the trailing edge of}} the wing to the rear pressure bulkhead. The aft section consisted of the tail cone, including all of the horizontal stabilizers and the vertical stabilizers. The engines and landing gear separated from the aircraft at the time of impact.|$|E
25|$|The {{flat-headed cat}} is {{distinguished}} at once by the extreme {{depression of the}} skull, which extends along the <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extremity of the muzzle, the sides of which are laterally distended. The general habit of body is slender, and the extremities are delicate and lengthened. The head itself is more lengthened and cylindrical than in the domestic cat. The distance between the eyes and the ears is comparatively great. The cylindrical form and lateral contraction of the head is contrasted by an unusual length of the teeth. The canine teeth are nearly as long as in an individual of double its size.|$|E
25|$|Price ran Carry Back twenty-one {{times as}} a two-year-old juvenile, {{beginning}} in Florida in January, winning five times, with four seconds and four thirds. Even for the time, that was an exceptionally taxing campaign for an immature colt. In his first sixteen starts, Carry Back won two minor races, attracting some press attention when setting a track record for five furlongs at Gulfstream Park in April. He finished third to Hail to Reason in the Sapling Stakes at Oceanport in August and second by a <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same colt in the World's Playground Stakes at Atlantic City in September.|$|E
50|$|K12 has {{a longer}} hood <b>to</b> {{accommodate}} <b>the</b> larger Continental engine. They can either have <b>the</b> rounded <b>nose</b> common <b>to</b> <b>the</b> KB8 and larger or a flat nose grill.|$|R
50|$|In most mammals, the philtrum is {{a narrow}} groove that may carry {{dissolved}} odorants from the rhinarium or <b>nose</b> pad <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vomeronasal organ via ducts inside the mouth.|$|R
50|$|The Sikorsky S-68 was a {{proposed}} {{modification of the}} S-58T turboshaft powered helicopter by moving its engines from <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> above <b>the</b> cabin similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> S-61. Doubt about the market potential of <b>the</b> design led <b>to</b> termination of <b>the</b> project before any examples were produced.|$|R
25|$|H5N1 {{is easily}} {{transmissible}} between birds, facilitating a potential global spread of H5N1. While H5N1 undergoes mutation and reassortment, creating variations which can infect species not previously known {{to carry the}} virus, {{not all of these}} variant forms can infect humans. H5N1 as an avian virus preferentially binds to a type of galactose receptors that populate the avian respiratory tract from the <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lungs and are virtually absent in humans, occurring only in and around the alveoli, structures deep in the lungs where oxygen is passed to the blood. Therefore, the virus is not easily expelled by coughing and sneezing, the usual route of transmission.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} of the 703 {{was entirely}} ply skinned, tapering gently from a blunt <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tail. There, a small, ply skinned fin carried a largely fabric covered, rounded, wide chord, balanced rudder which extended {{down to the}} keel. The straight tapered tailplane, also largely fabric covered, was set forward of the fin {{and at the top}} of the fuselage, so the elevators required only a small cut-out for the rudder to move in. The pilot sat upright just ahead of the wing leading edge under a multi-piece canopy which merged into the aft fuselage. The 703 had no landing wheel but just a sprung skid from the nose to behind the cockpit, on the deepest part of the fuselage. It was assisted by a tail bumper.|$|E
25|$|Masks {{may also}} {{indicate}} a culture's ideal of feminine beauty. The masks of Punu of Gabon have highly arched eyebrows, almost almond-shaped {{eyes and a}} narrow chin. The raised strip running {{from both sides of}} the <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ears represent jewellery. Dark black hairstyle, tops the mask off. The whiteness of the face represent the whiteness and beauty of the spirit world. Only men wear the masks and perform the dances with high stilts despite the masks representing women. One of the most beautiful representations of female beauty is the Idia's Mask of Benin in present-day Edo State of Nigeria. It is believed to have been commissioned by a king of Benin in memory of his mother. To honor his dead mother, the king wore the mask on his hip during special ceremonies.|$|E
25|$|Nasal {{endoscopy}} involves {{inserting a}} flexible fiber-optic tube {{with a light}} and camera at its tip into <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> examine <b>the</b> nasal passages and sinuses. This is generally a completely painless (although uncomfortable) procedure which takes between five and ten minutes to complete.|$|R
50|$|The Valais Blackneck has a {{distinctive}} colouring, black from <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> behind <b>the</b> shoulder and white from there <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tail. The English Bagot goat, which is similarly coloured, {{is thought to}} derive from this breed by descent from one presented to Richard II of England in 1380.|$|R
2500|$|The Goral was {{powered by}} an uncowled 425hp (315kW) Bristol Jupiter VIA [...] radial engine {{rather than the}} {{suggested}} Lion, driving a 12ft (3.65 m) two-bladed fixed-pitch propeller. [...] The engine exhausts ran along [...] {{both sides of the}} lower fuselage from <b>the</b> Goral's long <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> below <b>the</b> gunner's cockpit.|$|R
500|$|The Solomon Islands skink is the world's largest {{species of}} extant skink; adults can reach {{a length of}} [...] from <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tip of their tail when fully grown, with the tail {{accounting}} {{for more than half}} this length.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, the Guinness World Records {{accepted}} a male purebred Maine Coon named [...] "Stewie" [...] as the [...] "Longest Cat" [...] measuring [...] {{from the tip}} of his <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tip of his tail. Stewie died 4 February 2013, from cancer at his home in Reno, Nevada, at age 8. As of 2015 the living record-holder for [...] "Longest Cat" [...] is [...] "Ludo", measuring 3ft 10.59 in (118.33cm). He lives in Wakefield, UK. Large Maine Coons can overlap in length with Eurasian lynxes, although with a much lighter build and lower height.|$|E
500|$|In 1864, Rodin {{submitted}} {{his first}} sculpture for exhibition, The Man with the Broken <b>Nose,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Paris Salon. The subject was an elderly neighbourhood street porter. The unconventional bronze piece {{was not a}} traditional bust, but instead the head was [...] "broken off" [...] at the neck, the nose was flattened and crooked, {{and the back of}} the head was absent, having fallen off the clay model in an accident. The work emphasized texture and the emotional state of the subject; it illustrated the [...] "unfinishedness" [...] that would characterize many of Rodin's later sculptures. The Salon rejected the piece.|$|E
5|$|The J75 {{engine was}} {{slightly}} {{heavier than the}} PS-13, and therefore required ballast {{to be placed in}} <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>to</b> return <b>the</b> centre of gravity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> correct position. In addition, the Astra fire-control system was not ready, and it too, was replaced by ballast. The otherwise unused weapons bay was loaded with test equipment.|$|R
