5|$|A recent <b>necropsy</b> {{study of}} captive elk in Pennsylvania {{attributed}} {{the cause of}} death in 33 of 65 cases to either gastrointestinal parasites (21 cases, primarily Eimeria sp. and Ostertagia sp.) or bacterial infections (12 cases, mostly pneumonia).|$|E
5|$|In benign infections {{found in}} some wild and captive African elephants, these viruses can affect either the skin or the {{pulmonary}} system. In the former case, it produces small pinkish nodules {{on the head and}} trunk in juveniles, which appear for a few weeks and then regress, suggesting an intermittently reactivated localized infection that mostly remains dormant. In the second case, it has been found in small white pulmonary nodules on <b>necropsy</b> of many asymptomatic adults. These are both characteristic of EEHV2, EEHV3 and EEHV6.|$|E

She also discovers a cavity, where it appears something had lived inside the cat.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare, by using identical sample types, the Salmonella enterica prevalences and serovar diversities between pigs <b>necropsied</b> on the farm and those <b>necropsied</b> at the abattoir after transport and holding. We <b>necropsied</b> 567 market weight pigs (> 70 kg) from six herds. Pigs were alternately assigned to be <b>necropsied</b> on the farm or at the abattoir. One-half of the group was sent in clean, disinfected trailers to slaughter at a commercial abattoir. After transport (mean distance, 169 km) and 2 to 3 h of holding in antemortem pens, these pigs were <b>necropsied.</b> The 50 pigs remaining on the farm were <b>necropsied</b> the following day. The same sample types and amounts were collected for S. enterica culture at both locations. Results show a sevenfold-higher (P < 0. 001) S. enterica isolation rate from pigs <b>necropsied</b> at the abattoir (39. 9 %; 114 of 286) than from those <b>necropsied</b> on the farm (5. 3 %; 15 of 281). This difference was also observed for each individual herd. All sample types showed a significantly higher prevalence when comparing abattoir to on-farm collection, respectively: lymph nodes, 9. 15 versus 3. 6 %; cecal contents, 13. 6 versus 1. 8 %; 1 g of fecal matter, 25. 2 versus 0. 7 %. Recovery of additional serovars at the abattoir suggests the pigs are receiving S. enterica from extra-farm sources. This study demonstrates that rapid infection during transport, and particularly during holding, is a major reason for increased S. enterica prevalence in swine. This finding identifies the holding pen as an important S. enterica control point in the pork production chain...|$|R

5|$|Japanese noise {{rock group}} Boredoms have {{borrowed}} elements of grind, and toured with Brutal Truth in 1993. The Japanese grindcore group Gore Beyond <b>Necropsy</b> formed in 1989, and later collaborated with noise music artist Merzbow. Naked City, led by avant-garde jazz saxophonist John Zorn, performed an avant-garde form of polystylistic, grindcore-influenced punk jazz. Zorn later formed the Painkiller project with ambient dub producer Bill Laswell on bass guitar and Mick Harris on drums, which also collaborated with Justin Broadrick on some work. In addition, grindcore was one {{influence on the}} powerviolence movement within American hardcore punk, and has affected some strains of metalcore. Some musicians have also produced hybrids between grind and electronic music.|$|E

40|$|THE present paper {{concerns}} six {{examples of}} Alzheimer's disease met {{with in a}} series of 487 consecutive <b>necropsies</b> performed in two mental hospitals, giving an incidence of 1 - 23 per cent. in those of their population submitted to post-mortem examination. Four of these occurred in a sequence of 48 <b>necropsies,</b> showing the fallacy of estimating frequency on the basis of small numbers. Yet, although the precise incidence of Alzheimer's disease is difficult to assess, it would appear from the experience of several workers that the disease, contrary to what was formerly believed, is not uncommon. For instance, Rothschild and Kasanin (1936) found a 4 per cent. incidence {{in a series of}} 234 <b>necropsies</b> performed at the Foxborough State Hospital. The view is further borne out by Mayer-Gross (1938), who reports that seven examples were sent to the Maudsley Hospital for histological examination in 18 months, representing {{only a fraction of the}} L. C. C. Mental Hospital material, and also by Newton (1939), who found three instances in a year in a total of about 100 <b>necropsies</b> at Napsbury Hospital where others are under observation in the wards...|$|R

40|$|One lung from 109 unselected {{hospital}} and 43 unselected non-hospital <b>necropsies</b> was studied using postmortem radiography with histological verification. Signs of acute bacterial infection, including bronchiolitis or bronchopneumonia, {{were present in}} 42. 2 % of the hospital <b>necropsies</b> and infection was the immediate {{cause of death in}} 8. 3 %. There was only one case of incipient bronchopneumonia among the non-hospital <b>necropsies.</b> Emphysema was the most common other pulmonary lesion in both groups. Gram negative bacteria were found significantly more often in the bronchial mucus of lungs with any pulmonary lesion, particularly those with signs of bacterial infection, than in the bronchial mucus of morphologically normal lungs in both groups of patients. In addition, the frequency of infections was associated with length of stay in hospital. This may reflect the prevalence of Gram negative infections in hospitals...|$|R

25|$|While {{the eggs}} of F. magna {{resemble}} those of F. hepatica, this similarity is of limited use; eggs usually are not passed in cattle and sheep. Recovery of the parasites at <b>necropsy,</b> as well as proper identification of F. hepatica or F. gigantica is necessary for definite diagnosis. When domestic ruminants and deer share the same grazing areas, the presence of disease due to F. magna {{should be kept in}} mind. Mixed infections with F. hepatica occur in cattle.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{incidence}} of second impact syndrome is unknown, the condition is rare; very few cases have been confirmed in medical literature. In the 13-year period from 1980â€“1993, 35 American football related cases of SIS were recorded, but only 17 of these were confirmed by <b>necropsy</b> or surgery and magnetic resonance imaging {{to be due to}} SIS, and 18cases were found to be probably SIS-related. Additionally, the initial trauma commonly goes unreported, adding to the confusion about how often the syndrome occurs.|$|E
40|$|Studies on helminthfauna of {{marsh deer}} Blastocerus dichotomus Illiger, 1815 are rare, {{although}} helminthic diseases {{are an important}} cause of mortality in these animals. Fifteen male and female adult marsh deer from Sergio Motta's hydroelectric power station flooding area at ParanÃ¡ River which died during the capture and quarantine procedures, between 1998 and 1999, were <b>necropsied.</b> Three trematodes species, Paramphistomum cervi, Balanorchis anastrofus and Zygocotyle lunatum, all belonging to superfamily Paramphistomoidea, were identified. The obtained trematodes were identified, counted and their respectives descriptors of infection were determined. All <b>necropsied</b> animals were infected by helminths.

25|$|Laboratory reports {{carried out}} on some {{mutilated}} animals have shown unusually high or low levels of vitamins or minerals in tissue samples, {{and the presence of}} chemicals not normally found in animals. However, not all mutilated animals display these anomalies, and those that do have slightly different anomalies from one another. On account of the time between death and <b>necropsy,</b> and a lack of background information on specific cattle, investigators have often found it impossible to determine if these variations are connected to the animals' deaths or not.|$|E
25|$|Up to 15 {{cases of}} {{stranded}} manatees {{are reported in}} Puerto Rico each year. Some of these cases involve animals that have died near shore, either from natural causes or human related accidents. Others cases reported consist of live manatees, whether ill, injured or orphaned in need of veterinary attention. The PRMCC is deputized by both the Commonwealth and Federal governments to respond to these stranding events, and conduct an investigation on the cause of death, including a <b>necropsy,</b> or rescue and transport the live animal to the PRMCC's rehabilitation facility for veterinary treatment and care.|$|E
25|$|Signs include acute {{onset of}} {{moderate}} to severe pain, large volumes orange-brown and fetid gastric reflux, distended small intestine on rectal examination, fever, depression, increased heart rate and respiratory rate, prolonged CRT, and darkened mucous membranes. Pain level usually improves after gastric decompression. It is important to differentiate DPI from small intestinal obstruction, since obstruction may require surgical intervention. This can be difficult, and often requires a combination of clinical signs, results from the physical examination, laboratory data, and ultrasound to help suggest one diagnosis over the other, but a definitive diagnosis can only be made with surgery or on <b>necropsy.</b>|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Although {{echocardiography}} is {{more accurate}} than electrocardiography for detection of left ventric-ular hypertrophy, it is also more expensive, making it uncertain whether echocardiography is cost-effective for detection of this abnormality in hypertensive patients. Accordingly, the sensitivity of M-mode echocardiographic and electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy was determined in <b>necropsied</b> patients with anatomic hypertrophy of mild (n = 26), moderate (n = 21) or severe (n = 46) degree, and the prevalence of each degree of hypertrophy was determined in 561 hypertensive adults drawn from clinical and employed population samples.

25|$|On September 16, 2012, Mei Xiang {{gave birth}} to another cub, {{believed}} by zoo officials {{to have been a}} female, which died after about a week. Initial results from a <b>necropsy</b> (animal autopsy) revealed the abnormal presence of fluid in the abdomen and also discoloration of the liver (hepatic) tissue of unknown etiology; the cub had managed to nurse before death because milk was found in its system. Zoo officials said that, while upsetting, they (and, by extension, the public) can hope to learn more about giant panda breeding, reproduction, and health as a result, and will work closely and cooperatively with their Chinese colleagues during the inquiry.|$|E
25|$|The tests {{used for}} {{detecting}} BSE vary considerably, {{as do the}} regulations in various jurisdictions for when, and which cattle, must be tested. For instance in the EU, the cattle tested are older (30 months or older), while many cattle are slaughtered younger than that. At {{the opposite end of}} the scale, Japan tests all cattle at the time of slaughter. Tests are also difficult, as the altered prion protein has very low levels in blood or urine, and no other signal has been found. Newer tests are faster, more sensitive, and cheaper, so future figures possibly may be more comprehensive. Even so, currently the only reliable test is examination of tissues during a <b>necropsy.</b>|$|E
