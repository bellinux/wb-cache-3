40|$|AbstractA uniform {{array of}} scalar-sensors with intersensor {{spacings}} {{over a large}} aperture size generally offers enhanced resolution and source localization accuracy, {{but it may also}} lead to cyclic ambiguity. By exploiting the polarization information of impinging waves, an electromagnetic vector-sensor array outperforms the unpolarized scalar-sensor array in resolving this cyclic ambiguity. However, the electromagnetic vector-sensor array usually consists of cocentered orthogonal loops and dipoles (COLD), which is easily subjected to mutual coupling across these cocentered dipoles/loops. As a result, the source localization performance of the COLD array may substantially degrade rather than being improved. This paper proposes a new source localization method with a non-cocentered orthogonal loop and dipole (<b>NCOLD)</b> array. The <b>NCOLD</b> array contains only one dipole or loop on each array grid, and the intersensor spacings are larger than a half-wavelength. Therefore, unlike the COLD array, these well separated dipoles/loops minimize the mutual coupling effects and extend the spatial aperture as well. With the <b>NCOLD</b> array, the proposed method can efficiently exploit the polarization information to offer high localization precision...|$|E

The properties of these waves are consistent with modes generated by a strong electron heat flux in an unmagnetized plasma. Such modes become unstable when the effective drift velocity exceeds <b>n(cold)</b> /(hot) exp 1 / 2 times the thermal speed of the hot component. The occasional simultaneous appearance of more than one frequency band is a possible indication of multiple magnetic connection with the shock...|$|E
