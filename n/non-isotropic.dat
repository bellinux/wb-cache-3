50|$|Although {{symmetry}} {{demands that}} the permittivity is isotropic for zero wavevector, this restriction does not apply for nonzero wavevector. The <b>non-isotropic</b> permittivity for nonzero wavevector leads to effects such as optical activity in solutions of chiral molecules. In isotropic materials without optical activity, the permittivity tensor {{can be broken down}} to transverse and longitudinal components, referring to the response to electric fields either perpendicular or parallel to the wavevector.|$|E
50|$|A {{possible}} way of sampling distances is the ray marching method. It works similar to ray tracing but operates on a distance {{field of the}} scene and acts in discrete steps. The scattering inside the media can be determined by a phase function using importance sampling. Therefore, the Henyey-Greenstein phase function can be applied. It is a <b>non-isotropic</b> phase function for simulating the scattering of materials like oceans, clouds or skin.|$|E
50|$|Lemaître's {{proposal}} {{met with}} skepticism from his fellow scientists. Eddington found Lemaître's notion unpleasant. Einstein found it suspect because he deemed it unjustifiable from a physical point of view. On the other hand, Einstein encouraged Lemaître {{to look into}} the possibility of models of <b>non-isotropic</b> expansion, so it is clear he was not altogether dismissive of the concept. He also appreciated Lemaître's argument that a static-Einstein model of the universe could not be sustained infinitely into the past.|$|E
50|$|For <b>non-isotropic</b> {{radiators}} such as parabolic antennas, headlights, and lasers, {{the effective}} origin is located {{far behind the}} beam aperture. If you {{are close to the}} origin, you don't have to go far to double the radius, so the signal drops quickly. When you are far from the origin and still have a strong signal, like with a laser, you have to travel very far to double the radius and reduce the signal. This means you have a stronger signal or have antenna gain {{in the direction of the}} narrow beam relative to a wide beam in all directions of an isotropic antenna.|$|E
50|$|According to Equation 3, {{acoustic}} waves {{with varying}} speeds {{will appear on}} the Brillouin spectra with varying wavenumbers: faster waves with higher magnitude wavenumbers and slower waves with smaller wavenumbers. Therefore, three distinct Brillouin lines will be observable. In isotropic solids the two transverse waves will be degenerate, as they will be traveling along elastically identical crystallographic planes. In <b>non-isotropic</b> solids the two transverse waves will be distinguishable from one another, but not distinguishable as being horizontally or vertically polarized without {{a deeper understanding of the}} material being studied. They are then generically labeled transverse 1 and transverse 2.|$|E
50|$|More than a centure ago Oskar Hertwig {{proposed}} that the cell division orientation {{is determined by the}} shape of the cell (1884), known as Hertwig rule. In the epithelium the cells 'reads' its shape through the specific cell junction called tricellular junctions (TCJ). TCJ provide mechanical and geometrical clues for the spindle apparatus to ensure that cell divide along its long axis. Several factors could regulate cell shape and therefore orientation of cell division. Among these factors is the anisotropic mechanical stress. This stress could be the result of the external mechanical deformation of generated intracellularly by <b>non-isotropic</b> localization of specific proteins.|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} field {{method is}} {{an alternative to the}} popular technique of Ewald summation. Today, Ewald summation is the usual technique of choice, but for many quantities of interest both techniques yield equivalent results. For example, in Monte Carlo simulations of liquid crystals, (using both the hard spherocylinder and Gay-Berne models) the results from the reaction field method and Ewald summation are consistent. However, the reaction field presents a considerable reduction in the computer time required. The reaction field should be applied carefully, and becomes complicated or impossible to implement for <b>non-isotropic</b> systems, such as systems dominated by large biomolecules or systems with liquid-vapour or liquid-solid coexistence.|$|E
50|$|A first-order {{extension}} of the isotropic Gaussian scale space {{is provided by the}} affine (Gaussian) scale space. One motivation for this extension originates from the common need for computing image descriptors subject for real-world objects that are viewed under a perspective camera model. To handle such non-linear deformations locally, partial invariance (or more correctly covariance) to local affine deformations can be achieved by considering affine Gaussian kernels with their shapes determined by the local image structure, see the article on affine shape adaptation for theory and algorithms. Indeed, this affine scale space can also be expressed from a <b>non-isotropic</b> {{extension of}} the linear (isotropic) diffusion equation, while still being within the class of linear partial differential equations.|$|E
50|$|The vector {{definition}} {{is suitable for}} the study of general radiative fields. The scalar or hemispheric spectral flux density is convenient for discussions in terms of the two-stream model of the radiative field, which is reasonable for a field that is uniformly stratified in flat layers, when the base of the hemisphere is chosen to be parallel to the layers, and one or other sense (up or down) is specified. In an inhomogeneous <b>non-isotropic</b> radiative field, the spectral flux density defined as a scalar-valued function of direction and sense contains much more directional information than does the spectral flux density defined as a vector, but the full radiometric information is customarily stated as the spectral radiance (or specific intensity).|$|E
50|$|There are {{interesting}} relations between scale-space representation and biological vision and hearing.Neurophysiological studies of biological vision {{have shown that}} there are receptive field profiles in the mammalian retina and visual cortex,which can be well modelled by linear Gaussian derivative operators, in some cases also complemented by a <b>non-isotropic</b> affine scale-space model, a spatio-temporal scale-space model and/or non-linear combinations of such linear operators.Regarding biological hearing there are receptive field profiles in the inferior colliculus and the primary auditory cortex that can be well modelled by spectra-temporal receptive fields that can be well modelled by Gaussian derivates over logarithmic frequencies and windowed Fourier transforms over time with the window functions being temporal scale-space kernels.|$|E
50|$|The term {{microemulsion}} {{was first}} used by T. P. Hoar and J. H. Shulman, professors of chemistry at Cambridge University, in 1943. Alternative names for these systems are often used, such as transparent emulsion, swollen micelle, micellar solution, and solubilized oil. More confusingly still, the term microemulsion can refer to the single isotropic phase that {{is a mixture of}} oil, water and surfactant, or to one that is in equilibrium with coexisting predominantly oil and/or aqueous phases, or even to other <b>non-isotropic</b> phases. As in the binary systems (water/surfactant or oil/surfactant), self-assembled structures of different types can be formed, ranging, for example, from (inverted) spherical and cylindrical micelles to lamellar phases and bicontinuous microemulsions, which may coexist with predominantly oil or aqueous phases.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is often}} claimed that {{volumetric}} displays {{are incapable of}} reconstructing scenes with viewer-position-dependent effects, such as occlusion and opacity. This is a misconception; a display whose voxels have <b>non-isotropic</b> radiation profiles are indeed able to depict position-dependent effects. To-date, occlusion-capable volumetric displays require two conditions: (1) the imagery is rendered and projected {{as a series of}} [...] "views," [...] rather than [...] "slices," [...] and (2) the time-varying image surface is not a uniform diffuser. For example, researchers have demonstrated spinning-screen volumetric displays with reflective and/or vertically diffuse screens whose imagery exhibits occlusion and opacity. One system created HPO 3D imagery with a 360-degree field of view by oblique projection onto a vertical diffuser; another projects 24 views onto a rotating controlled-diffusion surface; and another provides 12-view images utilizing a vertically oriented louver.|$|E
5000|$|Point-collimation {{instruments}} have pinholes {{that shape}} the X-ray beam {{to a small}} circular or elliptical spot that illuminates the sample. Thus the scattering is centro-symmetrically distributed around the primary X-ray beam and the scattering pattern in the detection plane consists of circles around the primary beam. Owing to the small illuminated sample volume and the wastefulness of the collimation process [...] - [...] only those photons are allowed to pass that happen to fly {{in the right direction}} [...] - [...] the scattered intensity is small and therefore the measurement time is in the order of hours or days in case of very weak scatterers. If focusing optics like bent mirrors or bent monochromator crystals or collimating and monochromating optics like multilayers are used, measurement time can be greatly reduced. Point-collimation allows the orientation of <b>non-isotropic</b> systems (fibres, sheared liquids) to be determined.|$|E
5000|$|A conoscopic {{interference}} pattern or interference figure {{is a pattern}} of birefringent colours crossed by dark bands (or isogyres), which can be produced using a geological petrographic microscope {{for the purposes of}} mineral identification and investigation of mineral optical and chemical properties. The figures are produced by optical interference when diverging light rays travel through an optically <b>non-isotropic</b> substance - that is, one in which the substance's refractive index varies in different directions within it. The figure {{can be thought of as}} a [...] "map" [...] of how the birefringence of a mineral would vary with viewing angle away from perpendicular to the slide, where the central colour is the birefringence seen looking straight down, and the colours further from the centre equivalent to viewing the mineral at ever increasing angles from perpendicular. The dark bands correspond to positions where optical extinction (apparent isotropy) would be seen. In other words, the interference figure presents all possible birefringence colours for the mineral at once.|$|E
5000|$|These {{results are}} empirical; where does {{computational}} complexity come in? QMC {{is not a}} panacea for all high dimensional integrals. What is special about financial derivatives? Here's a possible explanation. The [...] dimensions in the CMO represent monthly future times. Due to the discounted value of money variables representing times for in the future are {{less important than the}} variables representing nearby times. Thus the integrals are <b>non-isotropic.</b> Sloan and Woźniakowski introduced the very powerful idea of weighted spaces which is a formalization of the above observation. They were able to show that with this additional domain knowledge high dimensional integrals satisfying certain conditions were tractable even in the worst case! In contrast the Monte Carlo method gives only a stochastic assurance. See Sloan and Woźniakowski When are Quasi-Monte Carlo Algorithms Efficient for High Dimensional Integration? J. Complexity 14, 1-33, 1998. For which classes of integrals is QMC superior to MC? This continues to be a major research problem.|$|E
50|$|Thin non-resonant or broad {{resonance}} coatings can {{be modeled}} with a Leontovich impedance boundary condition (see also Electrical impedance). This is {{the ratio of}} the tangential electric field to the tangential magnetic field on the surface, and ignores fields propagating along the surface within the coating. This is particularly convenient when using boundary element method calculations. The surface impedance can be calculated and tested separately.For an isotropic surface the ideal surface impedance is equal to the 377 ohm impedance of free space.For <b>non-isotropic</b> (anisotropic) coatings, the optimal coating depends on the shape of the target and the radar direction, but duality, the symmetry of Maxwell's equations between the electric and magnetic fields, tells one that optimal coatings have η0 × η1 = 3772 Ω2, where η0 and η1 are perpendicular components of the anisotropic surface impedance, aligned with edges and/or the radar direction.A perfect electric conductor has more back scatter from a leading edge for the linear polarization with the electric field parallel to the edge and more from a trailing edge with the electric field perpendicular to the edge, so the high surface impedance should be parallel to leading edges and perpendicular to trailing edges, for the greatest radar threat direction, with some sort of smooth transition between.|$|E
5000|$|Main {{achievements}} of that period. In the Unit of Cybernetics {{the theory of}} probabilistic automation devices and methods for the synthesis of probabilistic processors for computers were built. It {{became the basis for}} a processor that increases the speed of solving a wide class of problems in statistical modeling creation. There was developed CAD of lift systems, intended to optimize the operation of transport systems and traffic. Works of UC were widely recognized {{by the end of the}} 1960s. In 1969 in Kazan the first all-Union Symposium on probabilistic automation devices was organized and held. The activities of the Unit of probability theory and mathematical statistics were focused on the study of probabilistic structures associated with other areas of mathematics. The staff of the Unit developed a topological method of the study of probability in functional spaces. There was developed a new concept in stochastic analysis based on the use of spaces of Sobolev type, justified a new approach to the problem of the guarantee of statistical inference. New efficient statistical criteria were constructed and investigated. Thus, the system of warranty of quality control of metal products - which allowed reducing the consumption of metal for the control of maintaining the level of quality - was created. The algorithm for image recognition based on the new characteristics of <b>non-isotropic</b> random fields was proposed. The results served as the basis for the creation of such research areas as [...] "Probabilistic structures and their applications" [...] in Kazan University. All-Union school on non-commutative probability theory, organized by RIMM in 1971, greatly stimulated the development of this direction.|$|E
5000|$|To {{partially}} reiterate {{the discussion}} above, the slowly varying envelope approximation (SVEA) {{of the electric}} field of a wave with central wave vector [...] and central frequency [...] of the pulse, is given by:We consider the propagation for the SVEA of the electric field in a homogeneous dispersive nonisotropic medium.

The term in [...] is the group velocity dispersion (GVD) or second-order dispersion; it increases the pulse duration and chirps the pulse as it propagates through the medium. The term in [...] is a third-order dispersion term that can further increase the pulse duration, even if [...] vanishes. The terms in [...] and [...] describe the walk-off of the pulse; the coefficient [...] is the ratio of the component of the group velocity [...] and the unit vector in the direction of propagation of the pulse (z-axis). The terms in [...] and [...] describe diffraction of the optical wave packet in the directions perpendicular to the axis of propagation. The terms in [...] and [...] containing mixed derivatives in time and space rotate the wave packet about the [...] and [...] axes, respectively, increase the temporal width of the wave packet (in addition to the increase due to the GVD), increase the dispersion in the [...] and [...] directions, respectively, and increase the chirp (in addition to that due to [...] ) when the latter and/or [...] and [...] are nonvanishing. The term [...] rotates the wave packet in the [...] plane. Oddly enough, because of previously incomplete expansions, this rotation of the pulse was not realized until the late 1990s but it has been experimentally confirmed. To third order, the RHS of the above equation is found to have these additional terms for the uniaxial crystal case:The first and second terms are responsible for the curvature of the propagating front of the pulse. These terms, including the term in [...] are present in an isotropic medium and account for the spherical surface of a propagating front originating from a point source. The term [...] can be expressed in terms of the index of refraction, the frequency [...] and derivatives thereof and the term [...] also distorts the pulse but in a fashion that reverses the roles of [...] and [...] (see reference of Trippenbach, Scott and Band for details).So far, the treatment herein is linear, but nonlinear dispersive terms are ubiquitous to nature. Studies involving an additional nonlinear term [...] have shown that such terms have a profound effect on wave packet, including amongst other things, a self-steepening of the wave packet. The non-linear aspects eventually lead to optical solitons.|$|E

40|$|The {{composite}} material {{research and development}} performed {{over the last year}} has greatly enhanced the capabilities of CTH for <b>non-isotropic</b> materials. The enhancements provide the users and developers with greatly enhanced capabilities to address <b>non-isotropic</b> materials and their constitutive model development. The enhancements to CTH are intended to address various {{composite material}} applications such as armor systems, rocket motor cases, etc. A new method for inserting <b>non-isotropic</b> materials was developed using Diatom capabilities. This new insertion method makes it possible to add a layering capability to a shock physics hydrocode. This allows users to explicitly model each lamina of a composite without the overhead of modeling each lamina as a separate material to represent a laminate composite. This capability is designed for computational speed and modeling efficiency when studying composite material applications. In addition, the layering capability also allows a user to model interlaminar mechanisms. Finally, <b>non-isotropic</b> coupling methods have been investigated. The coupling methods are specific to shock physics where the Equation of State (EOS) is used with a nonisotropic constitutive model.

In order to generate <b>non-isotropic</b> turbulence in a controlled environment, a scale model rotor in a closed chamber was used so that the turbulence generated by the rotor was reingested by the recirculating flow. Simultaneous measurements of turbulence inflow properties and far field acoustics were acquired. Measurements confirmed that the inflow turbulence was highly <b>non-isotropic.</b> The measured aerodynamic properties were used as inputs for the noise prediction procedure.
