50|$|Mechanochemical {{heterogeneity}} is {{a hallmark}} of living eukaryotic cells. It {{has an impact on}} epigenetic gene regulation. The heterogeneous dynamic mechanochemical processes regulate interrelationships within the group of cellular surfaces through adhesion. Tumour development and spreading is accompanied by change in heterogeneous chaotic dynamics of mechanochemical interaction process in the group cells, including cells within tumour, and is hierarchical for the host of cancer patients. It is suggested that the heterogeneity of hypoxia in solid tumors is due to the mechanochemical reactions with oxygen nanobubbles. The biological phenomena of mechanochemical heterogeneity maybe used for differential gastric cancer diagnostics against patients with inflammation of gastric mucosa and for increasing antimetastatic activity of dendritic cells based on vaccines when mechanically heterogenized microparticles of tumor cells are used for their loading. There is also a possible methodical approach based on the simultaneous ultrasound imaging diagnostic techniques and therapy, regarding the mechanochemical effect on <b>nanobubles</b> conglomerates with drugs in the tumour.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{temperature}} and degassing on {{the formation of}} nanobubbles at the Mica/water interface were investigated. The <b>nanobubles</b> were analyzed using atomic force microscopy. <b>Nanobubles</b> were formed by the liquids of different temperature in order to study the temperature effects. It was observed that the average density of the <b>nanobubles</b> was decreased when the ethanol and water were degassed. It was also observed that {{the density of the}} <b>nanobubles</b> were increased with the liquid temperature and showed a growth when temperature was more than 30 Â°C...|$|E
