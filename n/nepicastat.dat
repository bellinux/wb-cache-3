40|$|The dopamine-beta-hydroxylase {{inhibitor}} <b>nepicastat</b> {{has been}} shown to reproduce disulfiram ability to suppress the reinstatement of cocaine seeking after extinction in rats. To clarify its mechanism of action, we examined the effect of <b>nepicastat,</b> given alone or in association with cocaine or amphetamine, on catecholamine release in the medial prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens, two key regions involved in the reinforcing and motivational effects of cocaine and in the reinstatement of cocaine seeking. <b>Nepicastat</b> effect on catecholamines was evaluated by microdialysis in freely moving rats. <b>Nepicastat</b> reduced noradrenaline release both in the medial prefrontal cortex and in the nucleus accumbens, and increased dopamine release in the medial prefrontal cortex but not in the nucleus accumbens. Moreover, <b>nepicastat</b> markedly potentiated cocaine-and amphetamine-induced extracellular dopamine accumulation in the medial prefrontal cortex but not in the nucleus accumbens. Extracellular dopamine accumulation produced by <b>nepicastat</b> alone or by its combination with cocaine or amphetamine was suppressed by the alpha(2) -adrenoceptor agonist clonidine.

40|$|Inhibitory {{modulation}} of {{sympathetic nerve}} function {{may have a}} favourable impact on the progression of congestive heart failure. <b>Nepicastat</b> is a novel inhibitor of dopamine-β-hydroxylase, the enzyme which catalyses the conversion of dopamine to noradrenaline in sympathetic nerves. The in vitro pharmacology and in vivo catecholamine modulatory effects of <b>nepicastat</b> were investigated in the present study. <b>Nepicastat</b> produced concentration-dependent inhibition of bovine (IC 50 = 8. 5 ± 0. 8 [*]nM) and human (IC 50 = 9. 0 ± 0. 8 [*][*]nM) dopamine-β-hydroxylase. The corresponding R-enantiomer (RS- 25560 - 198) was approximately 2 – 3 fold less potent than <b>nepicastat.</b> <b>Nepicastat</b> had negligible affinity (> 10 [*]μM) for twelve other enzymes and thirteen neurotransmitter receptors. Administration of <b>nepicastat</b> to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) (three consecutive doses of either 3, 10, 30 or 100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, p. o.; 12 [*]h apart) or beagle dogs (0. 05, 0. 5, 1. 5 or 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, p. o.; b. i. d., for 5 days) produced dose-dependent decreases in noradrenaline content, increases in dopamine content and increases in dopamine/noradrenaline ratio in the artery (mesenteric or renal), left ventricle and cerebral cortex. At the highest dose studied, the decreases in tissue noradrenaline were 47 %, 35 % and 42 % (in SHRs) and 88 %, 91 % and 96 % (in dogs) in the artery, left ventricle and cerebral cortex, respectively. When tested at 30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, p. o., in SHRs, <b>nepicastat</b> produced significantly greater changes in noradrenaline and dopamine content, {{as compared to the}} R-enantiomer (RS- 25560 - 198), in the mesenteric artery and left ventricle. Administration of <b>nepicastat</b> (2 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, b. i. d, p. o.) to beagle dogs for 15 days produced significant decreases in plasma concentrations of noradrenaline and increases in plasma concentrations of dopamine and dopamine/noradrenaline ratio. The peak reduction (52 %) in plasma concentration of noradrenaline and the peak increase (646 %) in plasma concentration of dopamine were observed on day- 6 and day- 7 of dosing, respectively. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} <b>nepicastat</b> is a potent, selective and orally active inhibitor of dopamine-β-hydroxylase which produces gradual modulation of the sympathetic nervous system by inhibiting the biosynthesis of noradrenaline.

The present studies were designed to extend to different alcohol-like behaviours the investigation into the “anti-addictive” properties of <b>nepicastat.</b> Moreover, we investigated whether <b>nepicastat</b> was capable of modifying the reinforcing and motivational properties of a chocolate solution and preventing the reinstatement of chocolate seeking in rats. Methods: Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) rats, selectively bred for excessive alcohol consumption, were exposed to different procedures of alcohol-motivated behaviours while Wistar rats were exposed to a series of procedures of use in evaluating the reinforcing and motivational properties of the chocolate solution.

40|$|Introduction: Disulfiram {{has been}} {{claimed to be}} useful in cocaine {{addiction}} therapy, its efficacy being attributed to dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) inhibition. Our previous results indicate that disulfiram and the selective DBH inhibitor <b>nepicastat</b> increase extracellular dopamine (DA) in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and markedly potentiated cocaine-induced increase. Concomitantly, in rats with cocaine self-administration history, cocaine-seeking behavior induced by drug priming was prevented, probably through overstimulation of D 1 receptors due to the DA increase. The present research was aimed at studying the neurochemical mechanisms originating the enhanced DA release. Methods: Noradrenergic system ablation was attained by intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) administration of the neurotoxin anti-DBH-saporin (aDBH-sap). DA, noradrenaline (NA), and DOPAC were assessed by HPLC after ex vivo tissue extraction or in vivo microdialysis. Control and denervated rats were subjected to microdialysis in the mPFC and caudate nucleus to evaluate the effect of nepicastat-cocaine combination on extracellular DA levels and their regulation by α 2 -adrenoceptors. Results: Fifteen days after neurotoxin or its vehicle administration, tissue and extracellular NA were reduced to less than 2 % the control value, while extracellular DA was increased by approximately 100 %. In control rats, <b>nepicastat</b> given alone and in combination with cocaine increased extracellular DA by about 250 % and 1100 %, respectively. In denervated rats, <b>nepicastat</b> slightly affected extracellular DA, while in combination with cocaine increased extracellular DA by 250 %. No {{differences were found in}} the caudate nucleus. Clonidine almost totally reversed the extracellular DA elevation produced by nepicastat-cocaine combination, while it was ineffective in denervated rats. Conclusions: This research shows that the increase of extracellular DA produced by <b>nepicastat</b> alone or in combination with cocaine was prevented by noradrenergic denervation. The results indicate that <b>nepicastat</b> enhances DA release from noradrenergic terminals supposedly by removing NA from α 2 -autoreceptors. In addition to the inhibition of DA uptake, the latter mechanism may explain the synergistic effect of cocaine on nepicastat-induced DA release...|$|E
40|$|Inhibitors of {{dopamine}} b-hydroxylase (DBH), {{the enzyme}} that converts dopamine (DA) to norepinephrine (NE) in noradrenergic cells, have shown promise {{for the treatment}} of cocaine abuse disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of these compounds have not been fully elucidated. We used the drug discrimination paradigm to determine the impact of DBH inhibitors on the interoceptive stimulus properties of cocaine. Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to discriminate cocaine (5. 6 mg/kg) from saline using a multicomponent, food-reinforced discrimination procedure. On test days, subjects were pretreated with the nonselective DBH inhibitor disulfiram (0 – 100. 0 mg/kg i. p.) or the selective DBH inhibitor <b>nepicastat</b> (0 – 56. 0 mg/kg i. p.) 2 hours prior to a test session either alone or in combination with cumulatively administered cocaine (0 – 5. 6 mg/kg i. p.). Neither disulfiram nor <b>nepicastat</b> substituted for the cocaine stimulus when tested up to doses that nonspecifically reduced responding. However, in combination studies, pretreatment with either di-sulfiram or <b>nepicastat</b> produced leftward shifts in the cocaine dose-response function and also conferred cocaine-like stimulus effects to the selective NE transporter inhibitor, reboxetine (0. 3 – 5. 6 mg/kg i. p.). These results indicate that pharmacological inhibition of DBH does not produce cocaine-like interoceptive stimulus effects alone, but functionally enhances the interoceptive stimulus effects of cocaine, possibly due to facilitated increases in DA released from noradrenergic terminals. These findings suggest that DBH inhibitors have low abuse liability and provide support to clinical reports that some subjective effects produced by cocaine, particularly aversive effects, are enhanced after DBH inhibition...|$|E
40|$|The anti-alcoholism medication, {{disulfiram}} (Antabuse), decreases {{cocaine use}} in humans regardless of concurrent alcohol consumption and facilitates cocaine sensitization in rats, but the functional targets are unknown. Disulfiram inhibits dopamine b-hydroxylase (DBH), the enzyme that converts dopamine (DA) to norepinephrine (NE) in noradrenergic neurons. The {{goal of this}} study was to test the effects of chronic genetic or pharmacological DBH inhibition on behavioral responses to cocaine using DBH knockout (Dbh 2 / 2) mice, disulfiram, and the selective DBH inhibitor, <b>nepicastat.</b> Locomotor activity was measured in control (Dbh +/ 2) and Dbh 2 / 2 mice during a 5 day regimen of saline+saline, disulfiram+saline, nepicastat+saline, saline+cocaine, disulfiram+cocaine, or nepicastat+cocaine. After a 10 day withdrawal period, all groups were administered cocaine, and locomotor activity and stereotypy were measured. Drug-naı̈ve Dbh 2 / 2 mice were hypersensitive to cocaine-induced locomotion and resembled cocaine-sensitized Dbh +/ 2 mice. Chronic disulfiram administration facilitated cocaine-induced locomotion in some mice and induced stereotypy in others during the development of sensitization, while cocaine-induced stereotypy was evident in all nepicastat-treated mice. Cocaine-induced stereotypy was profoundly increased in the disulfiram+cocaine, nepicastat+cocaine, and nepicastat+saline groups upon cocaine challenge after withdrawal in Dbh +/ 2 mice.

40|$|The antialcoholism {{medication}} disulfiram (Antabuse) inhibits {{aldehyde dehydrogenase}} (ALDH), {{which results in}} the accumulation of acetaldehyde upon ethanol ingestion and produces the aversive ‘Antabuse reaction' that deters alcohol consumption. Disulfiram {{has also been shown}} to deter cocaine use, {{even in the absence of}} an interaction with alcohol, indicating the existence of an ALDH-independent therapeutic mechanism. We hypothesized that disulfiram's inhibition of dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH), the catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme that converts dopamine (DA) to norepinephrine (NE) in noradrenergic neurons, underlies the drug's ability to treat cocaine dependence. We tested the effects of disulfiram on cocaine and food self-administration behavior and drug-primed reinstatement of cocaine seeking in rats. We then compared the effects of disulfiram with those of the selective DBH inhibitor, <b>nepicastat.</b> Disulfiram, at a dose (100 [*]mg/kg, i. p.) that reduced brain NE by ∼ 40 %, did not alter the response for food or cocaine on a fixed ratio 1 schedule, whereas it completely blocked cocaine-primed (10 [*]mg/kg, i. p.) reinstatement of drug seeking following extinction. A lower dose of disulfiram (10 [*]mg/kg) that did not reduce NE had no effect on cocaine-primed reinstatement. <b>Nepicastat</b> recapitulated the behavioral effects of disulfiram (100 [*]mg/kg) at a dose (50 [*]mg/kg, i. p.) that produced a similar reduction in brain NE. Food-primed reinstatement of food seeking was not impaired by DBH inhibition. Our results suggest that disulfiram's efficacy in the treatment of cocaine addiction is associated with the inhibition of DBH and interference with the ability of environmental stimuli to trigger relapse...|$|E
40|$|Disulfiram {{has shown}} promise as a {{pharmacotherapy}} for co-caine dependence in clinical settings, {{although it has}} many targets, and the behavioral and molecular mechanisms un-derlying its efficacy are unclear.

The present study was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled investigation of {{the long-term effects of}} therapy with the DBH inhibitor <b>nepicastat</b> (NCT) on the progression of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and remodeling in dogs with chronic heart failure (HF). Methods and Results—Moderate HF (LV ejection fraction [LVEF] 30 % to 40 %) was produced in 30 dogs by intracoronary microembolization. Dogs were randomized to low-dose NCT (0. 5 mg/kg twice daily, n 57) (L-NCT), high-dose NCT (2 mg/kg twice daily, n 57) (H-NCT), L-NCT plus enalapril (10 mg twice daily, n 58) (L-NCT 1 ENA), or placebo (PL, n 58). Transmyocardial (coronary sinus–arterial) plasma norepinephrine (tNEPI), LVEF, end-systolic volume, and end-diastolic volume were measured before and 3 months after initiating therapy. tNEPI levels were higher in PL compared with NL (86620 versus 13614 pg/mL, P, 0. 01). L-NCT alone and L-NCT 1 ENA reduced tNEPI toward normal (2864 and 39617 pg/mL respectively), whereas HD-NCT reduced tNEPI to below normal levels (3610 pg/mL). In PL dogs, LVEF decreased but was unchanged with L-NCT and increased with L-NCT 1 ENA. L-NCT and L-NCT 1 ENA prevented progressive LV remodeling, as evidenced by lack of ongoing increase in end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume, whereas H-NCT did not Conclusions—In dogs with HF, therapy with L-NCT prevented progressive LV dysfunction and remodeling.

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{indicate that}} the dopamine [...] hydroxylase (DBH) inhibitors disulfiram and <b>nepicastat</b> suppress cocaine-primed reinstatement of cocaine self-administration behaviour. Moreover, both inhibitors increase dopamine release in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and markedly potentiate cocaine-induced dopamine release in this region. This study was aimed to clarify if the suppressant effect of DBH inhibitors on cocaine reinstatement was mediated by the high extracellular dopamine in the rat mPFC leading to a supra-maximal stimulation of D 1 receptors in the dorsal division of mPFC, an area critical for reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behaviour. In line with previous microdialysis studies in drug-naive animals, both DBH inhibitors potentiated cocaine-induced dopamine release in the mPFC, in the same animals in which they also suppressed reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Similar to the DBH inhibitors, L-DOPA potentiated cocaine-induced dopamine release in the mPFC and suppressed cocaine-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behaviour. The bilateral microinfusion of the D 1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 into the dorsal mPFC not only prevented cocaine-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking but also reverted both disulfiram- and L-DOPA-induced suppression of reinstatement. Moreover, the bilateral microinfusion of the D 1 receptor agonist chloro-APB (SKF 82958) into the dorsal mPFC markedly attenuated cocaine-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. These results suggest that stimulation of D 1 receptors in the dorsal mPFC {{plays a crucial role}} in cocaine-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking, whereas the suppressant effect of DBH inhibitors and L-DOPA on drug-induced reinstatement is mediated by a supra-maximal stimulation of D 1 receptors leading to their inactivatio...|$|E
