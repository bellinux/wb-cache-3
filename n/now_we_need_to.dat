500|$|The period {{following}} Enema of the State saw {{the band}} experience great transition. [...] "We {{had gone from}} playing small clubs and sleeping on people's floors to headlining amphitheaters and staying in five-star hotels," [...] recalled Hoppus in 2013. [...] "After years of hard work, promotion, and nonstop touring, people knew who we were, and listened to what we were saying... it scared {{the shit out of}} us." [...] The band was rushed into recording the follow-up, as according to DeLonge, [...] "the president of MCA was penalizing us an obscene amount of money because our record wasn't going to be out in time for them to make their quarterly revenue statements. [...] And we were saying, 'Hey, we can't do this right <b>now,</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> reorganize ourselves and really think about {{what we want to do}} and write the best record we can.' They didn't agree with us." ...|$|E
500|$|Lamont {{has said}} that Labour lost the 2011 Scottish Parliament {{election}} because the party lost its direction, and that having failed to recognise the 2007 result as a defeat, it picked up the wrong signals from the 2010 general election that saw a strong Scottish Labour vote at Westminster. In February 2012 she told the Times Educational Supplement, [...] "We misread the 2010 (general) election, thinking it was confirmation that Scotland was a Labour country– it was probably confirmation that Scotland was still anti-Tory. There's an issue about rebuilding trust, and our confidence in the values that brought us into politics." [...] She told delegates at her party's 2012 Scottish conference {{that it was time}} for them to stop apologising for past mistakes. [...] "We know what happened last May – we looked tired and complacent and we got the kind of beating we deserved. But <b>now,</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> start building the kind of Scottish Labour Party which Scotland deserves and which Scotland needs." ...|$|E

500|$|The 2007–08 {{season began}} badly for Drogba as he {{expressed}} {{doubts about the}} departure of manager José Mourinho. He was reportedly in tears when Mourinho {{told him he was}} leaving the club, and said [...] "Mourinho's departure destroys a certain familiarity we had at the club. Many of us used to play first and foremost for the manager. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> forget those feelings and find another source of motivation". Following these claims, Drogba told France Football Magazine [...] "I want to leave Chelsea. Something is broken with Chelsea, The damage is big in the dressing room". Despite having signed a four-year contract with the club in 2006, Drogba reportedly pointed out several favoured clubs in the interview, identifying Barcelona, Real Madrid, Milan or Internazionale as possible future destinations, he later admitted he regretted this and was 100% committed to Chelsea. Drogba made it up to the fans by scoring in Chelsea's 2–0 victory over Middlesbrough on 20 October 2007, against Schalke 04 in the Champions League four days later, and two goals against Manchester City. In December 2007, Drogba was voted fourth (after Kaká, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo) for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year.|$|E
500|$|Jim Harrington of The Oakland Tribune {{described}} {{the show as}} a human embodiment of Britney Spears' [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" [...] (2002). He presumed [...] that the tour was a conscious transition for fans {{who did not want}} Cyrus to separate herself from the Hannah Montana franchise. Kirsty Cameron of The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Despite her relatively young age, Cyrus showed her unfailing capability as performer. With the help of her back-up dancers, Cyrus provided her audience with choreographed set pieces and a different spectacle for each song." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe noted that the Wonder World Tour presented Cyrus as both a [...] "PG-rated tween pop star and an edgy rocker eager". He stated that although she played both roles well, it was apparent that she was more at ease with the latter. Reed also felt the concert did little to display Cyrus' personality and ability to engage with the audience. [...] "We know she's got impressive vocal chops, but <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> feel what she's trying to put across in her songs, something beyond the standard 'You guys are awesome!' banter." [...] Scott Iwasaki of Deseret News reviewed a concert in which Cyrus was ill. He mentioned that because of her illness, her voice went flat. Iwasaki also expressed his viewpoint that [...] "if there [...] any worries that Miley Cyrus would become another Britney Spears train wreck, those worries were quelled during Tuesday night's show. She kept the show family-friendly and, although obviously sick, looked like she had a good time." [...] Marlin Levison of The Star Tribune believed the concert lacked much profundity until the last performance.|$|E

2500|$|Cantrell is {{critical}} of religion and Young Earth Creationism, satirizing them both in Alice In Chains' 2013 Album, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here. Cantrell stated, [...] "There are two things {{you never want to}} get into a conversation or argument about: politics and religion. But fuck, I guess we're {{going to be talking about}} this for awhile". [...] "No one in the band claims to be an expert on religion, but the title of the song [...] comes from something that a lot of people actually believe in". Cantrell also stated that he’s sick of the hypocrisy that’s taken over many facets of organized religion. [...] "I think there’s overwhelming evidence that things aren’t working right <b>now.</b> <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> start growing up as a people. When you’re teaching people that being gay is a mortal sin, yet a good portion of the people teaching this are fucking kids, there’s a huge problem".|$|E

60|$|It {{may seem}} a much greater {{undertaking}} to attack nationality and nationalism instead of patching up a compromise with these things, but {{along the line of}} independent nationality lies no hope of unity and peace and continuing progress for mankind. We cannot suffer these old concentrations of loyalty because we want that very loyalty which now, concentrates upon them to cement and sustain the peace of all the world. Just as in the past provincial patriotisms have given place to national patriotisms, so <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> oust these still too narrow devotions by a new unity and a new reigning idea, the idea of one state and one flag in all the earth.|$|E
