5|$|In theory, the emperor's {{political}} power was absolute, but {{even during the}} Han dynasty, he shared executive powers with civilian officials and normally based his decisions on the advice and formal consensus of his ministers. During the Song dynasty, a <b>national</b> <b>examination</b> system (Civil Service Exam) managed by scholar-bureaucrats was used to recruit officials; those who passed the palace examination – the highest-level examination in the empire – were appointed directly by the emperor to the highest central government positions. Like commoners, these senior officials had to obey his edicts as law or be punished. However, senior officials not only challenged the emperor over policy, but restrained him by invoking the ideal Confucian mores {{and values of the}} literati gentry class from which they came.|$|E

A minimum <b>national</b> <b>examination</b> score was established for admission to specific departments at specially designated colleges and universities, and the minimum score for admission to other universities was set by provincial-level authorities. Key universities established separate classes for minorities. When several applicants attained the minimum test score, the school had the option of making a selection, a policy that gave university faculty and administrators a certain amount of discretion but still protected admission according to academic ability.|$|E

2500|$|Well {{into the}} early modern era, mounted warriors still trained with the sword, lance and bows and arrows {{just as they had}} 700 years previously. 18th century {{historian}} and geographer Lê Qúy Đôn wrote that in the <b>national</b> <b>examination</b> established since 1724, cavalrymen were required to shoot three arrows at targets [...] away at a gallop. However, as firearms were introduced, the transition from cold weapons to gunpowder warfare in the cavalry branch was swift and thorough. Lê noted that in his lifetime, mounted archery was no longer practiced. Instead horsemen were trained to shoot targets with a carbine on horseback while galloping at full speed. It is not known why the cavalry branch was uninterested in taking up firearms sooner, even though guns and rifles had been a common scene in infantry and marine divisions since the late 16th century. Perhaps shooting on horseback was only made possible by the advent of flintlock mechanism in the 18th century.|$|E
