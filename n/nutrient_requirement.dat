50|$|Plant {{adaptations to}} {{oligotrophic}} soils provide for greater {{and more efficient}} nutrient uptake, reduced nutrient consumption, and efficient nutrient storage. Improvements in nutrient uptake are facilitated by root adaptations such as nitrogen-fixing root nodules, mycorrhizae and cluster roots. Consumption is reduced by very slow growth rates, and by efficient use of low-availability nutrients; for example the use of highly available ions to maintain turgor pressure, with low-availability nutrients reserved for the building of tissues. Despite these adaptations, <b>nutrient</b> <b>requirement</b> typically exceed uptake during the growing season, so many oligotrophic plants {{have the ability to}} store nutrients, for example in trunk tissues, when demand is low, and remobilise them when demand increases.|$|E

As a legume P.phaseoloides [...] can compensate for low N conditions by increasing symbiotic nitrogen fixation. This also explains its well response to added P. On poor soils 100 kg of P2O5 showed to bring benefital effect on the yield.The Inoculation of the seeds before sowing with Bradyrhizobium is advised for primary cultivated areas.|$|E

5000|$|Livestock include beef cattle, dairy cattle, horses, goats, {{sheep and}} llamas. There is no {{specific}} requirement of feed intake for each livestock because their feed continuously varies based on the animals’ age, sex, breed, environment, etc. However basic <b>nutrient</b> <b>requirement</b> of a livestock’s feed must consist of protein, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals. Dairy cattle need more energy in their feed than other type of cattle. Studies have shown that energy supplied by feed is provided by various carbohydrate sources include non-fiber carbohydrates (NFC) such as fermentable feeds or neutral detergent fiber (NDF) such as forage. Feeds with high NDF is good for rumen health, however provides less energy and vice versa. Fats are added in the livestock feed to increase energy concentration, especially when the NFC content is already too high since excessive NFC lessens the NDF fraction, affecting the rumen digestion. In ruminants, most proteins consumed are breakdown by microorganisms and the microorganism later get digested by the small intestine. The [...] suggested that the crude protein required in livestock feed should be less than 7%. Lactating ruminant especially dairy cattle require highest amount of protein, especially for milk synthesis. Minerals including calcium, phosphorus and selenium are required by livestock for maintaining growth, reproduction and bone health.|$|E
40|$|Mathematical {{programming}} {{models for}} nutrition planning {{in developing nations}} typically involve the optimization of a single criterion function subject to resource and nutritional constraints. The nutritional constraints specify that the amount available of each nutrient for human consumption should meet or exceed some prechosen <b>nutrient</b> <b>requirement</b> level. However, fixed <b>nutrient</b> <b>requirement</b> levels are difficult to prespecify. In this paper, a bicriteria mathematical programming model is proposed which does not require planners to prespecify <b>nutrient</b> <b>requirement</b> levels for several key nutrients. Instead, the model generates an entire set of efficient nutrition plans which supply various amounts of these nutrients. To demonstrate the use and potential benefits of this model, an illustrative application to Colombia, South America is included. bicriteria mathematical programming, nutrition planning, multiple criteria decision making...|$|E

40|$|Horses are grazers with a {{digestive}} {{system that is}} adapted for a high fiber diet. Forage is a fiber rich feed that includes grass and legumes. A deficiency of forage and an excess of grains may cause gut disturbances and stereotypic behavior. The aim of this literature study was to summarize information on the horse’s capacity to consume forage-only diets with focus on the horse’s need of energy and protein. The results suggest that all horses are able to consume forage-only diets, which is also shown in previous studies. The forage needs to be equivalent to the horse’s <b>nutrient</b> <b>requirement</b> and consumption capacity. The energy content or the protein content of the forage can be a limiting factor.

40|$|ABSTRACT Because elderly {{adults have}} {{distinct}} metabolic characteristics that alter various <b>nutrient</b> <b>requirements,</b> simple extrapolations of <b>nutrient</b> <b>requirements</b> for younger adults are not warranted. Gastrointestinal function is well preserved with aging regarding the digestion and absorption of macronutrients, but the aging gastrointestinal tract becomes less efficient in absorbing vitamin B- 12, vitamin D, and calcium. The new dietary reference intakes considered recent studies in aging adults {{and concluded that}} the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) should be 1200 mg and 15 g for calcium and vitamin D, respectively, for persons over the age of 70 y. The new RDAs for riboflavin, niacin, thiamine, folate, vitamin B- 6, and vitamin B- 12 are not different for persons in the oldest age category (> 70 y) than for those aged 51 – 70 y.
