5|$|In 2009, 86% of cadmium {{was used}} in batteries, {{predominantly}} in rechargeable <b>nickel-cadmium</b> batteries. <b>Nickel-cadmium</b> cells have a nominal cell potential of 1.2V. The cell consists of a positive nickel hydroxide electrode and a negative cadmium electrode plate separated by an alkaline electrolyte (potassium hydroxide). The European Union put a limit on cadmium in electronics in 2004 of 0.01%, with some exceptions, and reduced the limit on cadmium content to 0.002%.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, these {{decreases}} in consumption were compensated {{by a growing}} demand for cadmium for <b>nickel-cadmium</b> batteries, which accounted for 81% of the cadmium consumption in the United States in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Ni(IV) {{is present}} in the mixed oxide , while Ni(III) {{is present in}} nickel(III) oxide, which is used as the cathode in many {{rechargeable}} batteries, including <b>nickel-cadmium,</b> nickel-iron, nickel hydrogen, and nickel-metal hydride, and used by certain manufacturers in Li-ion batteries. Ni(IV) remains a rare oxidation state of nickel and very few compounds are known to date.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of the Leclanché cell in 1866 and the subsequent improvement of the batteries containing manganese dioxide as cathodic depolarizer increased the demand of manganese dioxide. Until the development batteries with <b>nickel-cadmium</b> and lithium, most batteries contained manganese. The zinc-carbon battery and the alkaline battery normally use industrially produced manganese dioxide because natural occurring manganese dioxide contains impurities. In the 20th century, manganese dioxide was widely used as the cathodic for commercial disposable dry batteries of both the standard (zinc-carbon) and alkaline types.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium {{occurs as}} a minor {{component}} in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production. Cadmium was used {{for a long time}} as a corrosion-resistant plating on steel, and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow pigments, to colour glass, and to stabilize plastic. Cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is toxic (it is specifically listed in the European Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and <b>nickel-cadmium</b> batteries have been replaced with nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries. One of its few new uses is cadmium telluride solar panels.|$|E
5|$|Photovoltaic (PV) arrays powered Mir. The station used a 28volt DC supply which {{provided}} 5-, 10-, 20- and 50-amp taps. When {{the station was}} illuminated by sunlight, several solar arrays mounted on the pressurised modules provided power to Mirs systems and charged the <b>nickel-cadmium</b> storage batteries installed throughout the station. The arrays rotated in only one degree of freedom over a 180° arc, and tracked the sun using sun sensors and motors installed in the array mounts. The station itself also had to be oriented to ensure optimum illumination of the arrays. When the station's all-sky sensor detected that Mir had entered Earth's shadow, the arrays were rotated to the optimum angle predicted for reacquiring the sun once the station passed out of the shadow. The batteries, each of 60Ah capacity, were then used to power the station until the arrays recovered their maximum output on the day side of Earth.|$|E
5|$|Common battery {{technologies}} used in today's home PV systems include, {{the valve}} regulated lead-acid battery– {{a modified version}} of the conventional lead–acid battery, <b>nickel–cadmium</b> and lithium-ion batteries. Lead-acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, lithium-ion batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to economies of scale provided by large production facilities such as the Gigafactory 1. In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in electric cars may serve as a future storage devices in a vehicle-to-grid system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back. Other rechargeable batteries used for distributed PV systems include, sodium–sulfur and vanadium redox batteries, two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Two 30-amp-hour, <b>nickel-cadmium,</b> {{rechargeable}} batteries provided power when the spacecraft was not facing the Sun, and during launch, correction maneuvers and Mars occultation.|$|E
25|$|The {{power to}} the two orbiter craft was {{provided}} by eight 1.57 × 1.23 m solar panels, two on each wing. The solar panels comprised a total of 34,800 solar cells and produced 620 W of power at Mars. Power was also stored in two <b>nickel-cadmium</b> 30-A·h batteries.|$|E
25|$|For example, in Puerto Rico {{a system}} with a {{capacity}} of 20 megawatts for 15 minutes (5 megawatt hour) stabilizes the frequency of electric power produced on the island. A 27 megawatt 15-minute (6.75 megawatt hour) <b>nickel-cadmium</b> battery bank was installed at Fairbanks Alaska in 2003 to stabilize voltage {{at the end of}} a long transmission line.|$|E
25|$|In 1899, a Swedish {{scientist}} named Waldemar Jungner {{invented the}} <b>nickel–cadmium</b> battery, a rechargeable battery that had nickel and cadmium electrodes in a potassium hydroxide solution; the first battery {{to use an}} alkaline electrolyte. It was commercialized in Sweden in 1910 and reached the United States in 1946. The first models were robust and had significantly better energy density than lead-acid batteries, but were much more expensive.|$|E
25|$|The Wii Remote uses two AA {{batteries}} {{as a power}} source, {{which can}} power a Wii Remote for 60 hours using only the accelerometer functionality and 25 hours using both accelerometer and pointer functionality. In May 2013, Nintendo announced a rechargeable battery and dock accessory, and various third-party manufacturers market charging solutions for the controller (see Wii Remote Chargers). According to an interview with Nintendo industrial designer Lance Barr, limitations of the Wii Remote's expansion port make it unlikely {{that it will be}} used for internal battery charging. Although Nintendo discourages other rechargeable battery types such as lithium ion (Li-ion) and <b>nickel-cadmium</b> (NiCd), the company's support website indicates that nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) rechargeable batteries may be used. A 3300µF capacitor provides a temporary source of power during quick movements of the Wii Remote when connection to the batteries may be temporarily interrupted. If the Wii Remote is not used for more than 5 minutes, such as when the player is using a GameCube controller or watching Netflix, it will shut off, and can be re-activated by pressing any button.|$|E
25|$|A {{wet cell}} battery has a liquid electrolyte. Other names are flooded cell, since the liquid covers all {{internal}} parts, or vented cell, since gases produced during operation can {{escape to the}} air. Wet cells were a precursor to dry cells and are commonly used as a learning tool for electrochemistry. They can be built with common laboratory supplies, such as beakers, for demonstrations of how electrochemical cells work. A particular type of wet cell known as a concentration cell is important in understanding corrosion. Wet cells may be primary cells (non-rechargeable) or secondary cells (rechargeable). Originally, all practical primary batteries such as the Daniell cell were built as open-top glass jar wet cells. Other primary wet cells are the Leclanche cell, Grove cell, Bunsen cell, Chromic acid cell, Clark cell, and Weston cell. The Leclanche cell chemistry was adapted to the first dry cells. Wet cells are still used in automobile batteries and in industry for standby power for switchgear, telecommunication or large uninterruptible power supplies, but in many places batteries with gel cells have been used instead. These applications commonly use lead–acid or <b>nickel–cadmium</b> cells.|$|E
500|$|Lithium {{cobalt oxide}} (LiCoO2) {{is widely used}} in lithium ion battery cathodes. The {{material}} is composed of cobalt oxide layers in which the lithium is intercalated. During discharge, the lithium is released as lithium ions. <b>Nickel-cadmium</b> (NiCd) and nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries also include cobalt to improve the oxidation of nickel in the battery. Transparency Market Research estimated the global lithium-ion battery market at $30bn in 2015, and predicted an increase to over US$75 billion by 2024.|$|E
500|$|Cadmium {{has many}} common {{industrial}} uses {{as it is}} a key component in battery production, is present in cadmium pigments, coatings, and is commonly used in electroplating. In 2009, 86% of cadmium was used in batteries, predominantly in rechargeable <b>nickel-cadmium</b> batteries. The European Union banned the use of cadmium in electronics in 2004 with several exceptions but reduced the allowed content of cadmium in electronics to 0.002%. Cadmium electroplating, consuming 6% of the global production, [...] {{can be found in the}} aircraft industry due to the ability to resist corrosion when applied to steel components.|$|E

2500|$|In 1959, AMC and Sonotone Corporation {{announced}} {{work on a}} car to be {{powered by}} a [...] "self-charging" [...] battery. It was to have sintered plate <b>nickel-cadmium</b> batteries. During the 1960s, AMC partnered with Gulton Industries {{to develop a new}} battery based on lithium and to use an advanced speed controller designed by Victor Wouk. However, the actual running prototype was a 1969 Rambler American station wagon converted from [...] V8 to an all car electric using <b>nickel–cadmium</b> batteries. Power consisted of 160 cells, each rated at 75 ampere-hours (Gulton KO-75), arranged in two banks of 80 cells each, and connected in parallel. The equipment Wouk designed [...] "gave it good acceleration, but there was still a problem with the car's range." [...] Later, AMC and Gulton developed the Amitron and the similar Electron city cars.|$|E
2500|$|American Motors {{was also}} {{beginning}} to experiment in non-gasoline powered automobiles. On April 1, 1959, AMC and Sonotone Corporation announced a joint research effort to consider producing an electric {{car that was}} to be powered by a [...] "self-charging" [...] battery. Sonotone had the technology for making sintered plate <b>nickel–cadmium</b> batteries that can be recharged very rapidly and are lighter than a typical automobile lead–acid battery.|$|E
2500|$|Power was {{provided}} by two radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) units containing plutonium-238 affixed to {{opposite sides of the}} lander base and covered by wind screens.

Four wet cell sealed <b>nickel-cadmium</b> 8 ampere-hours (28,800 coulombs), 28 volts rechargeable batteries were also on board to handle peak power loads.|$|E
2500|$|In 1959, American Motors Corporation (AMC) and Sonotone Corporation {{announced}} a joint research effort to consider producing an electric car {{powered by a}} [...] "self-charging" [...] battery. AMC {{had a reputation for}} innovation in economical cars while Sonotone had technology for making sintered plate <b>nickel-cadmium</b> batteries that could be recharged rapidly and weighed less than traditional lead-acid versions. That same year, Nu-Way Industries showed an experimental electric car with a one-piece plastic body that was to begin production in early 1960.|$|E
2500|$|American Motors did {{not have}} their own {{electric}} car program as did the Big Three, and after some negotiation a contract was drawn in 1967 with Gulton Industries {{to develop a new}} battery based on lithium and a speed controller designed by Victor Wouk. A <b>nickel-cadmium</b> battery powered 1969 Rambler station wagon demonstrated the power systems that according to the scientist was a [...] "wonderful car". This was also the start of other [...] "plug-in"-type experimental AMC vehicles developed with Gulton – the Amitron and the Electron.|$|E
2500|$|Cadmium {{telluride}} is {{the only}} thin film material so far to rival crystalline silicon in cost/watt. However cadmium is highly toxic and tellurium (anion: [...] "telluride") supplies are limited. The cadmium present in the cells would be toxic if released. However, release is impossible during normal operation of the cells and is unlikely during ﬁres in residential roofs. A square meter of CdTe contains approximately {{the same amount of}} Cd as a single C cell <b>nickel-cadmium</b> battery, in a more stable and less soluble form.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{portable}} {{rechargeable batteries}} include several sealed [...] "dry cell" [...] types, that {{are useful in}} applications such as mobile phones and laptop computers. Cells of this type (in order of increasing power density and cost) include <b>nickel–cadmium</b> (NiCd), nickel–zinc (NiZn), nickel metal hydride (NiMH), and lithium-ion (Li-ion) cells. Li-ion has by far the highest share of the dry cell rechargeable market. NiMH has replaced NiCd in most applications due to its higher capacity, but NiCd remains in use in power tools, two-way radios, and medical equipment.|$|E
2500|$|The ram air turbine, {{capable of}} {{generating}} 100 kVA, is supplied by Hamilton Sundstrand and {{located in the}} lower surface of the fuselage. In light of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner battery problems, in February 2013 Airbus decided to revert from lithium-ion to the proven <b>nickel-cadmium</b> technology although the flight test programme will continue with the lithium-ion battery systems. In late 2015, MSN24 was delivered with [...] lighter Saft Li-ion batteries and in June 2017, fifty A350s were flying with them and benefiting from a two-year maintenance schedule instead of NiCd’s 4–6 months.|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. Big Three {{automakers}} {{had their}} own electric car programs during the late-1960s. In 1967, much smaller AMC partnered with Gulton Industries {{to develop a new}} battery based on lithium and a speed controller designed by Victor Wouk. A <b>nickel-cadmium</b> battery supplied power to an all-electric 1969 Rambler American station wagon. Other [...] "plug-in" [...] experimental AMC vehicles developed with Gulton included the Amitron (1967) and the similar Electron (1977). More battery-electric concept cars appeared over the years, such as the Scottish Aviation Scamp (1965), the Enfield 8000 (1966) and two electric versions of General Motors gasoline cars, the Electrovair (1966) and Electrovette (1976). None of them entered production.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary power}} source {{consisted}} of two [...] lithium-nickel-fluoride batteries rated at 150watt-hours per lb, or 331watt-hours per kg, with a total capacity of 22.5kWh. The designers selected lithium for the Amitron because [...] "it is both highly reactive (easy to oxidize) and has high electromotive potential." [...] The downside to these batteries {{is that they have}} relatively low instantaneous power, too little to provide reasonable acceleration or be able to handle the rapid recharging during regenerative braking. To handle these higher power peaks, a secondary power source consisting of two [...] <b>nickel-cadmium</b> (ni-cad) batteries was used. These batteries could accelerate the car to [...] in 20 seconds. During cruise, the lithium batteries recharged the ni-cads, which continued to power the motor.|$|E
2500|$|To gather more weather information, the Germans {{developed}} the Wetter-Funkgerät Land (WFL) automatic weather station. It {{was designed by}} Dr. Ernst Ploetze and Edwin Stoebe.

Power is supplied by a Bosch electric starter motor of [...] {{connected to a}} 30 volt DC <b>Nickel-cadmium</b> battery pack taken from a Hughes 500 helicopter, powering a [...] propeller through a reduction drive made from a timing belt and two pulleys. The battery is charged {{by a series of}} photovoltaic solar panels mounted in the top wing that provide 350 Watts of power. The solar cells are not sufficient to provide power in flight and all flights were made by recharging the battery on the ground from the solar cells and then flying using energy stored in the battery. A charge in bright sunshine {{for an hour and a}} half yields a flight of 3–5 minutes.|$|E

2500|$|Through the 1970s the {{hand-held}} electronic calculator underwent rapid development. The red LED and blue/green vacuum fluorescent displays consumed a lot {{of power}} and the calculators either had a short battery life (often measured in hours, so rechargeable <b>nickel-cadmium</b> batteries were common) or were large so that they could take larger, higher capacity batteries. In the early 1970s liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) were in their infancy and {{there was a great deal}} of concern that they only had a short operating lifetime. Busicom introduced the Busicom LE-120A [...] "HANDY" [...] calculator, the first pocket-sized calculator and the first with an LED display, and announced the Busicom LC with LCD. However, there were problems with this display and the calculator never went on sale. The first successful calculators with LCDs were manufactured by Rockwell International and sold from 1972 by other companies under such names as: Dataking LC-800, Harden DT/12, Ibico 086, Lloyds 40, Lloyds 100, Prismatic 500 (a.k.a. P500), Rapid Data Rapidman 1208LC. The LCDs were an early form using the Dynamic Scattering Mode DSM with the numbers appearing as bright against a dark background. To present a high-contrast display these models illuminated the LCD using a filament lamp and solid plastic light guide, which negated the low power consumption of the display. These models appear to have been sold only for a year or two.|$|E
