5|$|Argentina {{was still}} {{divided by the}} {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War. Menem proposed an agenda of <b>national</b> <b>reconciliation.</b> First, he arranged the repatriation of the body of Juan Manuel de Rosas, a controversial 19th century governor, and proposed to reconcile his legacy with those of Bartolomé Mitre and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, who also fought in the Argentine Civil Wars. Menem intended to use the reconciliation of these historical Argentine figures {{as a metaphor for the}} reconciliation of the Dirty War. However, although the repatriation and acceptance of Rosas was a success, the acceptance of the military regime was not.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of his exile, Zardari had several {{different}} legal problems. In Pakistan, Musharraf granted him amnesty for his alleged offences through the <b>National</b> <b>Reconciliation</b> Ordinance, drafted in October 2007. However, the ordinance faced mounting public pressure and an uncompromising judiciary. In addition, it only dealt with charges up to 1999. This left open the possibility of investigations into his alleged involvement in about $2 million in illegal kickbacks to Saddam Hussein, discovered in October 2005, under the oil-for-food program. If the ordinance was rescinded, {{he would have had to}} deal with charges relating to evading duties on an armoured BMW, commissions from a Polish tractor manufacturer, and a kickback from a gold bullion dealer. In Switzerland, Bhutto and Zardari appealed the 2003 Swiss conviction, which required the reopening of the case in October 2007. In November 2007, Swiss authorities returned the frozen $60 million to him through offshore companies because of the <b>National</b> <b>Reconciliation</b> Ordinance. In Spain, a criminal investigation was opened over the money laundering for the oil-for-food program because of the illicit profits handled through Spanish firms. In Britain, he was fighting a civil case against the Pakistani government for the proceeds from the liquidation sale of a Surrey mansion. He successfully used his medical diagnosis to postpone a verdict on his British manor trial.|$|E

5|$|Seeking <b>national</b> <b>reconciliation</b> between revolutionaries and Catholics, the Concordat of 1801 {{was signed}} on 15 July 1801 between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII.

The UN Security Council voted on 28 August 1997, to impose sanctions on UNITA through Resolution 1127, prohibiting UNITA leaders from traveling abroad, closing UNITA's embassies abroad, and making UNITA-controlled areas a no-fly zone. The Security Council expanded the sanctions through Resolution 1173 on 12 June 1998, requiring government certification for the purchase of Angolan diamonds and freezing UNITA's bank accounts.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007, Musharraf instituted {{emergency}} rule {{for six weeks}} (see Pakistani state of emergency, 2007), under the pretext of rising Islamist militancy, {{a few days after}} Bhutto's departure for Dubai to meet with Zardari. Immediately after the state of emergency was invoked, Bhutto returned to Pakistan, while Zardari again stayed behind in Dubai. Emergency rule was initiated right before the Supreme Court of Pakistan began deliberations on the legality of Musharraf's U.S.-backed proposal—the <b>National</b> <b>Reconciliation</b> Ordinance (NRO)—to drop corruption charges against Bhutto and Zardari in return for a joint Bhutto-Musharraf coalition to govern Pakistan. Bhutto and Zardari sympathised with Musharraf on his feud with the Supreme Court, but simultaneously criticised the imposition of martial law. Before the Supreme Court could issue a decision, Musharraf replaced its members with his supporters.|$|E

40|$|Zimbabwe is {{currently}} {{run by a}} power sharing government created by the Global Political Agreement (GPA) to resolve political conflict that resulted in devastating violence in 2008. This study offers a theoretical analysis of the challenges to <b>national</b> healing, <b>reconciliation</b> and development in Zimbabwe, post June 2008. The study argues that the challenges to <b>national</b> healing and <b>reconciliation</b> are embedded in the struggles for political hegemony. It posits that <b>national</b> healing and <b>reconciliation</b> are processes that have {{a direct impact on}} the political ascendency and fortunes of the main rival political parties, the MDC and ZANU-PF. The study also discloses that <b>national</b> healing and <b>reconciliation</b> in Zimbabwe are bleak because the ZANU-PF regime on whose watch violence occurred still controls the levers of political power making <b>national</b> healing and <b>reconciliation</b> difficult. The study stands on Gramsciâ€™s theory of hegemony to analyse the challenges to reconciliation and healing in Zimbabwe. The theory aptly explains the struggles for power and legitimacy which are key elements in reconciliation any reconciliation process...|$|R
5|$|The result {{confirmed}} the worries of some, including Spaak, {{that the vote}} would not be sufficiently decisive in either direction and could divide the country along regional and linguistic lines. On 13 March, Eyskens traveled to Pregny to attempt to encourage Leopold to abdicate. Paul Van Zeeland and Spaak attempted to broker a new agreement by which Leopold would abdicate in favour of his son. On 15 April 1950, Leopold {{announced that he was}} willing to temporarily delegate his authority.

5|$|In December 2009, the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} the <b>National</b> <b>Reconciliation</b> Ordinance amnesty was unconstitutional, which {{cleared the way for}} the revival of {{corruption}} cases against Zardari. Though Zardari had immunity from prosecution because he was President, the end of NRO and his earlier corruption cases challenged the legality of his presidency. Calls for his resignation escalated. Zardari, who rarely left the Aiwan-e-Sadr presidential palace, responded with a nationwide spurt of speeches in January 2011. In January 2010, the Supreme Court ordered Pakistan's government to reopen Zardari's corruption charges in Switzerland. However, Zardari prevented the MQM-leaning Attorney General, Anwar Mansoor, from filing charges, so Mansoor resigned in protest in early April. That same month, Zardari won a key victory against the judiciary over his corruption trials when Geneva Attorney General Daniel Zappelli stated that Zardari can not be prosecuted under international laws because of his presidential immunity. Zardari was supported by Prime Minister Gilani, who defied the Supreme Court order.|$|E

40|$|Given {{that women}} are the major victims of any conflict, their lived {{experiences}} should be {{the starting point of}} any post-reconstruction process. Proceeding from this premise, this study looked at the role of the church in <b>national</b> healing and <b>reconciliation</b> in Zimbabwe from a gendered perspective focusing specifically on Churches in Manicaland (CiM), a forum of churches operating in Manicaland province. While academic scholars have written about the activities of the church and church organisations in Zimbabwe (in the <b>national</b> healing and <b>reconciliation</b> process), there have been limited attempts at examining the intersections of gender and post-reconstruction processes such as <b>national</b> healing and <b>reconciliation</b> especially in as far as the church’s participation in the process is concerned. This study comes in to fill this gap in the existing scholarly literature by proposing a new model for <b>national</b> healing and <b>reconciliation</b> on which the church can lean. The aim {{of this study is to}} provide a womanist perspective to CiM’s activities in the <b>national</b> healing and <b>reconciliation</b> process in Zimbabwe by finding out if the Forum prioritises women’s experiences of political violence. The study is qualitative in nature and it utilised documents and interviews as tools for data collection from CiM officials. Input from women survivors of political violence as well as some men and women who witnessed political violence in the communities in Mutare Urban and Mutare Rural provided the raw data from which an analysis was drawn. The study found out that though CiM has been active in trying to bring healing and reconciliation to communities in Manicaland, it has not focused on women’s experiences of political violence as requiring special attention. From the responses of study participants, the study probed the possible reasons behind this neglect. Drawing from the experiences of women in Manicaland of political violence, the study proposed the adoption of a womanist model for <b>national</b> healing and <b>reconciliation.</b> The study argued that from this model, the church in Zimbabwe can come up with an all-inclusive African Womanist Theology of <b>national</b> healing and <b>reconciliation,</b> a theology which pays particular attention to how women experience conflict.
