25|$|The {{international}} {{humanitarian organisation}} Médecins Sans Frontières originated {{in response to}} the suffering in Biafra. During the crisis, French medical volunteers, in addition to Biafran health workers and hospitals, were subjected to attacks by the Nigerian army and witnessed civilians being murdered and starved by the blockading forces. French doctor Bernard Kouchner also witnessed these events, particularly the huge number of starving children, and, when he returned to France, he publicly criticised the Nigerian government and the Red Cross for their seemingly complicit behaviour. With the help of other French doctors, Kouchner put Biafra in the media spotlight and called for an international response to the situation. These doctors, led by Kouchner, concluded that a <b>new</b> <b>aid</b> organisation was needed that would ignore political/religious boundaries and prioritise the welfare of victims.|$|E

These researches gave an impetus to deep-sea exploration, an outcome of which was in 1868 the oceanographic survey with HMS Lightning and later the more famous Challenger Expedition. He took a keen and laborious interest in the evidence adduced by Canadian geologists as to the organic nature of the so-called Eozoon canadense, discovered in the Laurentian strata, also called the North American craton, and {{at the time of his}} death had nearly finished a monograph on the subject, defending the now discredited theory of its animal origin. He was adept in the use of the microscope, and his popular treatise on it stimulated many to explore this <b>new</b> <b>aid.</b> He was president of the Quekett Microscopical Club from 1883–85.

Our <b>new</b> visual <b>aid</b> was used in science class to one experimental group of third graders at a public elementary school. Theconventional photographs taken from a textbook were used to the other control group of the same grades. The results fromquestionnaires against pupils and analysis of protocol in the science class revealed the following four points. 1 ） Our new visualaid grew pupils wills to learn much more about plants and insects. 2 ） The sketches of pupils became finer, as such leaf hairsand veins were depicted, after the lecture using our <b>new</b> visual <b>aid.</b> 3 ） The talks of pupils are scientific in the experimentalgroup, while those are based on their experiences in the control group. 4 ） Almost all pupils in the experimental group thoughtthat our <b>new</b> visual <b>aid</b> is useful to them, because pupils pointed out our visual aid is easy to understand and our new visualaid is attractive with the first experience in their life. It is thus suggested that our <b>new</b> visual <b>aid</b> is an effective teaching toolfor pupils to learn how to observe plants and insects...|$|R
