60|$|Laban {{then went}} to the door. When he opened it the hum of bustle rolled out as a wave upon a still strand--the {{assemblage}} being immediately inside the hall--and was deadened to a murmur as he closed it again. Each man waited intently, and looked around at the dark tree tops gently rocking against the sky and occasionally shivering in a slight wind, as if he took interest in the scene, which <b>neither</b> did. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> began walking up and down, and then came to where he started from and stopped again, with a sense that walking was a thing not worth doing now.|$|R
2500|$|The term [...] "Tycho Magnetic Anomaly" [...] is {{something}} of a misnomer when referring to [...] "TMA-0" [...] and [...] "TMA-2", since neither of these are found on the Moon (let alone in Tycho Crater) and <b>neither</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> emits any significant magnetic field, as described in the novel [...] (The characters in some of the novels refer to this anomalous nomenclature quizzically.)

2500|$|Meanwhile, in the Vault, Regina has {{woken up}} {{after she and}} Robin Hood spent the night together. As Robin wakes up to embrace Regina, she is more {{concerned}} with the Once Upon a Time book and explains to Robin she that wants to find her happy ending and the author. Robin takes it upon himself to help Regina find the book's origins, so he steals the book after Regina raced off to the loft and pays a visit to Granny's, where he sees Will pouring his [...] "Lunch and Dinner" [...] (from a liquor flask) and asks for his help. Will tells Robin about how the events played out in Storybrooke until Emma's arrival and points to the place where it began. The two stop by the library, where after searching through several books, Robin notices a page falling out of his bag. He then calls Regina, who while helping the others find Emma was talking to Mary Margaret about the difference between being a hero and a villain. Regina was comforted by Mary Margret who insisted that <b>neither</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were all good or all evil. As Regina leaves to meet Robin, Mary Margret tells her that happy endings are hard to come by, but that she can have one if she is willing to fight for it.|$|E
2500|$|A {{critical}} tendency {{opposing the}} [...] "life cycle" [...] theory emphasizes {{the differences in}} tone and intent between this film and other Ozu works that deal with similar themes, situations and characters. These critics are also highly skeptical of the widely held notion that Ozu regarded marriage (or at least the marriage in Late Spring) favorably. As critic Roger Ebert explains, [...] "Late Spring began a cycle of Ozu films about families... Did he make the same film again and again? Not at all. Late Spring and Early Summer are startlingly different. In the second, Noriko takes advantage of a conversational opening [...] to overturn the entire plot... she accepts a man [...] she has {{known for a long}} time—a widower with a child." [...] In contrast, [...] "what happens [...] at deeper levels is angry, passionate and—wrong, we feel, because the father and the daughter are forced to do something <b>neither</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> wants to do, and the result will be resentment and unhappiness." [...] Ebert goes on, [...] "It is universally believed, just as in a Jane Austen novel, that a woman of a certain age is in want of a husband. Late Spring is a film about two people who desperately do not believe this, and about how they are undone by their tact, their concern for each other, and their need to make others comfortable by seeming to agree with them." [...] The film [...] "tells a story that becomes sadder the more you think about it." ...|$|E
40|$|Young {{children}} seem to overextend a 'seeing = knowing rule' so {{that they}} neglect to notice that people gain knowledge from inferring {{as well as from}} seeing. Yet that cannot be a sufficient explanation of children's problems with conceptualizing knowledge, because rule underextension occurs in children's claims to know something that they have not seen (nor inferred). The two errors were studied together with pairs of children aged 4 and 5 years. Each child had their own box, items on the table were shared out into the boxes, and either both children, or <b>neither,</b> or <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> looked in their own box. Children were asked if they and the other knew what was in each other's box; and were asked for explanations and predictions. About a quarter of the children showed full competence. In others, overextension and underextension occurred; yet almost all children explained that inference was involved in knowing, without bias towards giving such explanation more for self than for other. Error patterns were not predictable from a test for understanding the term 'know'. It is suggested that children have a framework conception of 'knowing' in which another's mind is treated as similar to own mind, but problems arise in implementing that insight before children manage to conceptualize constraints on knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Each of {{the five}} systems {{approaches}} discussed in this volume: system dynamics (SD), the viable systems model (VSM), strategic options development and analysis (SODA), soft systems methodology (SSM) and critical systems heuristics (CSH) has a pedigree. Not {{in the sense of}} the sometimes absurd spectacle of animals paraded at dog shows. Rather, their pedigree derives from their systems foundations, their capacity to evolve and their flexibility in use. None {{of the five}} approaches has developed out of use in restricted and controlled contexts of either low or high levels of complicatedness. <b>Neither</b> has any <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> evolved as a consequence of being applied only to situations with either presumed stakeholder agreement on purpose, or courteous disagreement amongst stakeholders, or stakeholder coercion. The compilation is not a celebration of abstract ‘methodologies’, but of theoretically robust approaches that have a genuine pedigree in practice...|$|R

2500|$|Labourer George Hutchinson, {{who knew}} Kelly, {{reported}} that she met him at about 2:00a.m. and asked him for a loan of sixpence. He claimed to be broke and that as Kelly went on her way she was approached by a man of [...] "Jewish appearance". Hutchinson later gave the police an extremely {{detailed description of the}} man right down to the colour of his eyelashes despite it being the middle of a dark winter night. He reported that he overheard them talking in the street opposite the court where Kelly was living; Kelly complained of losing her handkerchief, and the man gave her a red one of his own. Hutchinson claimed that Kelly and the man headed for her room, that he followed them, and that he saw <b>neither</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> again, laying off his watch at about 2:45. Hutchinson's statement appears to be partly corroborated by laundress Sarah Lewis, who reported seeing a man watching the entrance to Miller's Court as she passed into it at about 2:30 to spend the night with some friends, the Keylers. Hutchinson claimed that he was suspicious of the man because although Kelly seemed to know him, his opulent appearance made him seem very unusual in that neighbourhood, but only reported this to the police after the inquest on Kelly had been hastily concluded. Abberline, the detective in charge of the investigation, thought Hutchinson's information was important and sent him out with officers {{to see if he could}} see the man again. Hutchinson's name does not appear again in the existing police records, and so it is not possible to say with certainty whether his evidence was ultimately dismissed, disproven, or corroborated. In his memoirs Walter Dew discounts Hutchinson on the basis that his sighting may have been on a different day, and not the morning of the murder. Robert Anderson, head of the CID, later claimed that the only witness who got a good look at the killer was Jewish. Hutchinson was not a Jew, and thus not that witness. Some modern scholars have suggested that Hutchinson was the Ripper himself, trying to confuse the police with a false description, but others suggest he may have just been an attention seeker who made up a story he hoped to sell to the press.|$|E

60|$|That {{was how it}} had begun, {{and tragedy}} had been its end. On his abrupt {{departure}} she had {{followed him to the}} station but the train was gone; and in travelling to Baden in search of him she had met his rival, whose reproaches led to an altercation, and the death of both. Of that precipitate scene of passion and crime Fitzpiers had known nothing till he saw an account of it in the papers, where, fortunately for himself, no mention was made of his prior acquaintance with the unhappy lady; nor was there any allusion to him in the subsequent inquiry, the double death being attributed to some gambling losses, though, in point of fact, <b>neither</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had visited the tables.|$|E
60|$|Weeks {{and months}} of {{mourning}} for Winterborne {{had been passed}} by Grace in the soothing monotony of the memorial act to which she and Marty had devoted themselves. Twice a week the pair went in the dusk to Great Hintock, and, like the two mourners in Cymbeline, sweetened his sad grave with their flowers and their tears. Sometimes Grace {{thought that it was}} a pity <b>neither</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had been his wife for a little while, and given the world a copy of him who was so valuable in their eyes. Nothing ever had brought home to her with such force as this death how little acquirements and culture weigh beside sterling personal character. While her simple sorrow for his loss took a softer edge with the lapse of the autumn and winter seasons, her self-reproach at having had a possible hand in causing it knew little abatement.|$|E
60|$|Philip and Isabel {{were now}} at home. But the wife {{had not been}} able to turn her husband's mind from his late public humiliation. She was frightened, miserable. Would Philip always be as now--crushed, silent with the one he loved best? She buried her face in her hands. Her cheeks burned, while her eyes {{remained}} dry. She dared not weep, dared not break down before the changed, listless man whom she would save at any cost to her own anguish. As first days of home-coming dragged away she began to see that she had been presumptuous. After all, her marriage was not to be a happy one. She knew that Philip adored her even more than before the fatal afternoon at the mission, when he had fallen unconscious at her side; yet something obstinate and heart-rending had come between them. Tragic doubt seemed to be freezing her husband's tenderness. With passionate dread of misjudging him she withheld from day to day the question she could not ask. She felt that above all she must wait until the shock of his cruel punishment had ceased to be vivid. During sleepless nights, when she knew for the first time the price of a Catholic priest's apostasy, there came also the realization of personal, unjust punishment. Nor did she acknowledge wrong for either Philip or herself; they had done no wrong. They were created for each other, and their only mistake had been the last imprudent visit to a forbidden place. She grieved over her own ignorance which had permitted Philip to incur the risk which had turned against him. She was bitter, and because of a defensive attitude she could not understand her husband's crushed condition. The joy of those first two weeks at St. Barnabas had departed. Isabel knew that she was a constant reproach to the stricken man, utterly changed and gently silent. Through days when she tried to distract his mind from a forbidden subject, driving him, herself, about the country growing more lovely with each hour of spring, she felt the mutual strain to be almost intolerable. Lurid newspaper accounts of Philip's disgrace had helped to convert their once happy drives into perfunctory, humble attempts to escape notice. Now they went alone in a runabout, avoiding every evidence of ostentation. Country roads lured them from town and led them on to unfrequented foothill slopes, where blue buckthorn adorned sweet-smelling upland acres. Below the purple range deepened with March shadows, swept by fickle sunlight playing over crags and into canyons, the couple passed long intervals when <b>neither</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> spoke. Heart-breaking reticence tied their tongues. Each guessed the thoughts of the other.|$|E
