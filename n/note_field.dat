Personal health and {{the cost of health care}} are high on the public's agenda; this is an important backdrop to a review of public attitudes and priorities related to health and the environment. What about the environment? Americans increasingly believe that we are not spending enough on environmental protection and improvement. The public thinks of environmentalists in a favorable light, and a very sizeable minority believe they have too little influence [...] the same number who feel it's "about right. " Our surveys have shown that the more people perceive an environmental threat to their safety, well-being and health, the more they will want regulation or industry action to meet the threat. High on the public's anxiety list are hazardous wastes (especially their disposal) and the transport and use of toxic materials in manufacturing and processing, industrial accidents involving the release of pollutants, the leakage of chemical waste into the soil, and the pollution of water and air from industrial sources. Our data support the assumption that for the foreseeable future these and certain other ecological dangers will be seen as serious by large majorities of Americans. For example, even the safety of drinking water has slowly become more questionable in the public's mind. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E

40|$|The {{background}} {{of this study}} is the low condition of intensive reading ability in the eleventh grade students of Muhammadiyah Senior High School I Malang. The result of observation in Muhammadiyah Senior High School I Malang shows that their reading ability is less maximum, the causes are the technique in reading teaching implemented by the teacher – it tends to guide students on answering questions only from the teacher – and without using such reading technique, therefore there should be needed SQ 3 R method. The probolems are how is the implementation of teaching implementation by using SQ 3 R method to increase intensive reading ability in the eleventh students of Muhammadiyah Senior High School I Malang. This study is concerned to implement SQ 3 R method for increasing abilities: (a) literal understanding, (b) restructuring, (c) inferential understanding, and (d) concept and content assessment. This study is conducted by using qualitative and quantitative approach. It also uses such designs like class activity by implementing reading teaching by using SQ 3 R method. This study is conducted in eleventh students of Muhammadiyah Senior High School I Malang, while the subject of study is 21 students of Muhammadiyah Senior High School I Malang in the eleventh grade and Bahasa dan Sastra Indonesia teachers. The data in this study {{is in the form of}} teachers’ and students’ attitude in intesive reading teaching process by using SQ 3 R method and the increment of intensive reading, especially in capability of: (a) literal understanding, (b) restructuring, (c) inferential understanding, (d) assessment.

The researcher is as the observer and instrument, besides, here is used addition intrument in the form of observation guide, digital camera, evaluation rubric, and evaluation guide of students activity as long as reading learning process, and exercises and tests. The collected data is analyzed by using qualitative and quantitative method. The analysis technique used here is reduction data collection, data presentation, conclusion. The researcher is as observer and assessor of students activity and teachers as long as teaching learning process. The teacher of Bahasa Indonesia is as the teacher. The result shows that reading teaching learning proces by using SQ 3 R method gives chance to students to read by using the right steps of reading. Besides, students like reading learning; they become more creative, active, enjoy and courageous to give opinion and question. Thus, learning by using SQ 3 R method can increase intensive reading ability, it shows from percentage of students’ completeness...|$|E
40|$|Since World War Two, and {{particularly}} since confederation in 1949, {{the city of}} St. John's has witnessed considerable change. From a small urban area of about 8, 000 families physically encompassing no more than 1 ½ by ½ miles in 1935, the city has spread deep into the countryside, especially along the old roads out of town. Prior to this recent expansion, the area had been occupied by small family farms, dispersed unevenly along the roads, sometimes for distances of up to ten miles. The roots of this community extend back to {{the late eighteenth century}} when the first commercial farms were formed close to St. John's for the explicit purpose of providing fresh food to its inhabitants. Between roughly 1800 and 1840, close to 400 farms were established largely by poor Irish immigrants with some English and a few Scots. [...] The natural endowment was anything but encouraging for large scale commercial agriculture. Soils were thin, highly leached, acidic, rocky and usually poorly drained. Cultivating the land was back breaking; it involved clearing scrub timber, removing countless rock fragments and applying large amounts of natural fertilizers to the land. Cool, wet summers and a relatively short growing season made crop types of the old world such as wheat and barley impossible to grow commercially. These conditions were only amenable to pastoral grasses and cool weather arable crops like potatoes, cabbage and turnips. Yet these settlers and their descendants managed to strike deep roots in the area, raising large families from the meagre profits wrested from the land. In the past two or three decades, this traditional farm community has been bulldozed virtually into oblivion. Suburban streets, a university and C. M. H. C. housing now occupy former fields and farmsteads but here and there {{along the edge of the}} city a few farmers continue to work the land. [...] This thesis is an attempt to reconstruct the evolution and development of this traditional farm settlement from its inception to its dissolution. It focuses particularly on the commercial farm economy, seeking to understand the kinds of trading links that were established between the country and the town. Research involved both archival and field investigation. An assessment of archival sources is contained in a bibliographic <b>note.</b> <b>Field</b> work involved a series of interviews supplemented by a reading of the relict agricultural landscape. Interviews were conducted among thirty older residents who lived in the study area most of their lives. Since the dissolution of the community, however, most have been dislodged from their farms. This created some difficulty in tracing informants. Yet, twenty large and small scale farms were reconstructed in detail, supplemented by several other farms for certain other aspects of the study. Information on the formation and evolution of the farm, its location, size, number of acres improved, crops under cultivation, types of livestock, the farming system and, most importantly, the methods of marketing surplus produce were obtained. This information was coupled with material of a quantitative and documentary nature available in the archives to build up as accurate a picture as possible of the 400 farms which existed during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Wherever possible, sketches, maps and photographs have been used to illustrate aspects of specific farms, as well as spatially delimit the extent of the agrarian hinterland...|$|E

The data that were obtained in the observation study consist of both a generous amount and depth of data that have made the observed object more understandable.
