He started odds-on favourite and successfully conceded three pounds to Duke of Richmond, winning comfortably by three quarters of a length. On his final start of the year he won at Newmarket for the third time when taking the Jockey Club Cup.|$|E
5|$|Because Baltimore's {{electorate}} {{is overwhelmingly}} Democratic, whoever won the Democratic primary election {{was seen as}} the favorite over the Republican nominee in the general election. Baltimore's large African American population initially made it seem likely that the next mayor would also be African American. Kweisi Mfume was the preferred candidate of local politicians, but he opted <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>run.</b> Though Carl Stokes and Lawrence Bell, members of the City Council, declared for the race, local leaders were underwhelmed with the quality of declared candidates.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{kept his}} pledge <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for re-election, retired {{to his home}} in Ohio, and became an {{advocate}} of social and educational reform. Biographer Ari Hoogenboom said his greatest achievement was to restore popular faith in the presidency and to reverse the deterioration of executive power that had set in after Abraham Lincoln's death. Although supporters have praised his commitment to civil service reform and defense of civil rights, Hayes is generally listed among the high-end of the bottom half in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.|$|E
