The choice of a damping liquid for aircraft instruments is difficult owing to the range of temperature at which aircraft operate. Temperature changes affect the viscosity tremendously. The investigation was undertaken with the object of finding liquids of various viscosities otherwise suitable which had a minimum change in viscosity with temperature. The new data relate largely to solutions. The effect of temperature on the kinematic viscosity of the following liquids and solutions was determined in the temperature interval - 18 degrees to + 30 degrees C. (1) solutions of animal and vegetable oils in xylene. These were poppy-seed oil, two samples of neat's-foot oils, castor oil, and linseed oil. (2) solutions of mineral oil in xylene.

Methods: Crude extracts of L. adoensis var. koseret were extracted by maceration method. Disc diffusion assay of the extracts were carried out in four different concentrations against three different bacteria species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli) and two clinical isolated fungal species (Candida albicans and Aspergillus flavus) by using Kirby- Baur disk diffusion method. Agar dilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration, the minimum bactericidal and fungicidal concentrations of the extracts against similar microorganisms.
