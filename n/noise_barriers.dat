5|$|Widening of the Kwinana Freeway with {{an extra}} {{southbound}} lane between Roe Highway and Armadale Road began in mid-2014. The project aims to increase the freeway's reliability, efficiency, and safety, as the current two-lane configuration is subject to {{a large proportion of}} heavy vehicles and severe peak hour congestion. The project also involves the realignment of ramps at Berrigan Drive and Armadale Road, construction of <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> and noise walls where required, and installation of components for intelligent transport systems – optic fibre communications, vehicle detection devices, and closed circuit cameras.|$|E
25|$|<b>Noise</b> <b>barriers</b> can be {{effective}} tools for noise pollution abatement, but certain locations and topographies are not suitable for use of <b>noise</b> <b>barriers.</b> Cost and aesthetics {{also play a role}} in the choice of <b>noise</b> <b>barriers.</b> In some cases, a roadway is surrounded by a noise abatement structure or dug into a tunnel using the cut-and-cover method.|$|E
40|$|A {{crashworthy}} traffic <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> {{system for}} use alongside {{a path of}} traffic, the crashworthy traffic <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> system comprises a crashworthy longitudinal barrier extending substantially parallel to the path of traffic and a crashworthy traffic <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> wall supported by the longitudinal barrier. The crashworthy traffic <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> wall includes a plurality of upstanding posts attached to the traffic <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> wall, at least one panel supported between each adjacent pair of posts in the plurality of upstanding posts, {{and at least one}} longitudinal beam spaced above a top surface of the longitudinal barrier and extending across the plurality of upstanding posts for redirecting a portion of an errant vehicle away from the at least one panel. The longitudinal beams redirect energy of the errant vehicle away from the panels such that the panels and any fragments of the panels, remain attached to the traffic <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> wall. The panels may be transparent and may be reinforced with plastic bands, plastic threads, or a plastic net...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} {{noise reduction}} of the "noise barrier with a non-straight top edge" that has a periodic structural feature on its top edge along the length. The top edge geometry of this <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> is created by optimization of the diffracted sound field based on the Maggi-Rubinowicz theory. To further enhance the <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> performance, {{the rear of the}} top edge is covered with porous sound-absorbing material. The excellence of this complex system is improvement of its noise reduction by over about 3 to 5 dB at the point behind the barrier in frequency ranges from 125 Hz to over 4 kHz compared with an ordinary <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> of the same height. It will not create a zone in which sound is augmented, either. Originally designed primarily for temporary hoarding at a construction site, this <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> is expected to effectively serve against a wide range of noise sources. This paper reports a case example of use of this <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> and outlines the characteristics of its noise reduction performance and mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} of a <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> is to reduce traffic noise levels in adjoining areas. The noise abatement decisions are made during the environmental stage of project development, which is a highly interactive process. Before a <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> is designed, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) needs to be confident that there is significant need, a cost-effective and environmentally acceptable <b>noise</b> <b>barrier,</b> a source of funds, and acceptance by adjacent property owners, local governmental agencies, and the general public. Preliminary design information that {{may be found in}} the noise report includes: • Sources of noise. • Noise receiver locations. • Predicted level of noise reduction. • Locations of existing and future noise impacts along the project corridor. • Barrier location and height recommendations based on what is feasible and reasonable. Design of a <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> project {{is the result of a}} team effort coordinated by the Project Engineer. This chapter addresses the factors that are considered when designing a <b>noise</b> <b>barrier</b> and the associated procedures and documentation requirements...|$|R

25|$|Roads are a chief {{source of}} {{environmental}} noise generation. In the early 1970s it was recognized that design of roads can {{be conducted to}} influence and minimize noise generation. <b>Noise</b> <b>barriers</b> are used to reduce noise pollution, in particular where roads are located close to built-up areas.

25|$|<b>Noise</b> <b>barriers</b> {{force the}} {{pollution}} plumes {{coming from the}} road to move {{up and over the}} barrier creating the effect of an elevated source and enhancing vertical dispersion of the plume. The deceleration and the deflection of the initial flow by the noise barrier force the plume to disperse horizontally. A highly turbulent shear zone characterized by slow velocities and a re-circulation cavity is created in the lee of the barrier which further enhances the dispersion; this mixes ambient air with the pollutants downwind behind the barrier.|$|E
25|$|In Bamberg {{the upgrade}} plans caused protests among the citizens, as DB planned to build high <b>noise</b> <b>barriers.</b> Subsequently, the plans were rejected. Three new options {{emerged from a}} dialogue: {{optimised}} new noise protection on the existing route, which would be lowered at sensitive points, a tunnel for freight trains or a complete bypass of Bamberg to the east through the main stretch of carr (marshy forest), parallel to the A73. The current draft of the Federal Transport Plan (Bundesverkehrswegeplan) for 2030 includes the bypass along the A 73 because it has the best benefit/cost ratio.|$|E

25|$|The road {{follows a}} south-north path that connects key neighborhoods and {{commercial}} areas, {{as well as}} several city arteries and national routes. Beginning at the Tunnels Junction, the road travels North-west through Gilo and Malha to Golomb Junction, whence the road travels northward below the high ridge of the Holyland neighborhood to the west. To the east is Emek Hatzva'im (Gazelle Valley), a green zone which was previously leased to Kiryat Anavim and Ma'ale HaHamisha and used for agricultural purposes. Further on, the path was excavated to create a depressed roadway between Bayit Vegan, Givat Mordechai, Ramat Beit HaKerem and Givat Ram. This section is equipped with <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> and speed cameras.|$|E
25|$|Not {{far from}} the GE plant is {{downtown}} Schenectady, which the now six-lane I-890 largely bypasses {{to the south and}} west on an elevated highway passing over a mostly industrial section of the city. The section closest to the city center runs past by the campus of Schenectady County Community College and provides panoramic views of downtown Schenectady. I-890 heads south from downtown, crossing over the Delaware and Hudson Railway and CSX's Hudson Subdivision before finally connecting to downtown by way of Broadway at exit5. Past Broadway, the elevated highway comes to an end as I-890 heads southeastward into a dense residential area on a plateau overlooking the city. The homes are not visible from I-890, however, as the freeway is lined on both sides by a thick line of trees serving as <b>noise</b> <b>barriers.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, in June 1987, the National Park Service {{reversed}} its ruling after Montgomery County {{agreed to}} build <b>noise</b> <b>barriers</b> and wildlife crossings and purchase land {{to compensate for}} the woods lost to construction of the highway. By this time, parts of the highway were under construction in Rockville and Germantown. The first segment of the highway, from Middlebrook Road south to MD 117, opened in August 1987. The second segment to open was from Darnestown Road, then part of MD 28, north to MD 124; this southern segment was open by April 1989. The coalition of civic and environmental groups filed another lawsuit in March 1988 seeking to block construction of the middle segment from MD 124 to MD 117, but the lawsuit was dismissed on appeal in April 1989. Montgomery County began construction on the middle section in 1988 while the lawsuit was working its way through the courts because they were confident of prevailing. Great Seneca Highway fully opened when the middle section was completed in June 1990. In 1999, Great Seneca Highway north of MD 28 was designated MD 119 as part of a statecounty maintenance swap in which 22 state highways were transferred to Montgomery County maintenance.|$|E

500|$|Wind shear {{can have}} a {{pronounced}} effect upon sound propagation in the lower atmosphere, where waves can be [...] "bent" [...] by refraction phenomenon. The audibility of sounds from distant sources, such as thunder or gunshots, is very dependent {{on the amount of}} shear. The result of these differing sound levels is key in noise pollution considerations, for example from roadway noise and aircraft noise, and must be considered in the design of <b>noise</b> <b>barriers.</b> This phenomenon was first applied to the field of noise pollution study in the 1960s, contributing to the design of urban highways as well as <b>noise</b> <b>barriers.</b>|$|E
