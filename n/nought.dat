5|$|In the United Kingdom, Fisher {{returned}} to his old post as First Sea Lord; he had been created 1st Baron Fisher in 1909, taking the motto Fear God and dread <b>nought.</b> This, combined with a government moratorium on battleship building, meant a renewed focus on the battlecruiser. Fisher resigned in 1915 following arguments about the Gallipoli Campaign with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this {{disaster}} King Rama I predicted that the Chakri dynasty would last only 150 years from its foundation. This prophecy was recorded in a diary of a princess of the first reign, after reading it many years later, King Rama V remarked that 150 years was too short and that the princess must have inadvertently dropped a <b>nought.</b> This prophecy was again present {{in the minds of many}} people, when only three months after the dynasty's 150th anniversary celebrations the Siamese revolution of 1932 was carried out. The revolution replaced the absolute monarchy of the Chakri monarchs with a constitutional monarchy with Siam's first constitution.|$|E
5|$|Pagan priests, too, were {{interested}} in suppressing any threat to traditional religion. The Christian Arnobius, writing during Diocletian's reign, attributes financial concerns to provisioners of pagan services:The augurs, the dream interpreters, the soothsayers, the prophets, and the priestlings, ever vain...fearing that their own arts be brought to <b>nought,</b> and that they may extort but scanty contributions from the devotees, now few and infrequent, cry aloud, 'The gods are neglected, and in the temples {{there is now a}} very thin attendance. Former ceremonies are exposed to derision, and the time-honoured rites of institutions once sacred have sunk before the superstitions of new religions.'They believed their ceremonies were hindered by the presence of Christians, who were thought to cloud the sight of oracles and stall the gods' recognition of their sacrifices.|$|E

5|$|In September, Murray {{played his}} debut singles {{match for the}} Davis Cup in the World Group Play-off against Switzerland in Geneva on clay with Greg Rusedski, Alan Mackin and David Sherwood. Captain Jeremy Bates {{surprised}} everyone by naming Murray as the British No 1 and Alan Mackin as British No 2. Under the Davis Cup rules, this meant that for Friday's singles, Murray played the Swiss No 2, Stan Wawrinka while Mackin played the Swiss No 1, Roger Federer. Both of them lost their rubbers, giving Switzerland a 2–0 lead. Under the rules, for Sunday's reverse singles, Bates {{would have been able}} to substitute Mackin with Greg Rusedski, so that Rusedski would play Wawrinka, while Murray played Federer. However, Bates believed that Federer was virtually unbeatable because he was on a winning streak and hadn’t lost since June, and consequently Britain gambled on beating Wawrinka twice, with Murray playing Wawrinka when he was freshest. In the doubles, Murray/Rusedski played Federer and Yves Allegro, leaving Rusedski to play only once. The British tactics came to <b>nought</b> as Switzerland won the doubles rubber as well, gaining an unassailable 3–0 lead after two days. Alan Mackin and David Sherwood were consequently nominated for the dead singles rubbers losing both of them, resulting in a clean sweep for Switzerland.|$|E
