2500|$|The {{entomologist}} E. O. Wilson has <b>characterised</b> <b>parasites</b> as [...] "predators {{that eat}} prey in units {{of less than}} one". Within that scope are many possible ways of life. Parasites are classified {{in a variety of}} different but overlapping schemes, based on their interactions with their hosts and on their life cycles. An obligate parasite is totally dependent on the host to complete its life cycle, while a facultative parasite is not. A direct parasite has only one host while an indirect parasite has multiple hosts. For indirect parasites, {{there will always be a}} definitive host and an intermediate host.|$|R
40|$|Cryptosporidium is an {{important}} cause of enteric disease in humans and other animals. Limitations associated with conventional diagnostic methods for cryptosporidiosis based on morphological features, coupled with the difficulty of <b>characterising</b> <b>parasites</b> isolated in the laboratory, have restricted our ability to clearly identify species. The application of sensitive molecular approaches has obviated the necessity for laboratory amplification. Such studies have found considerable evidence of genetic heterogeneity among isolates of Cryptosporidium from different species of vertebrate, and there is now mounting evidence suggesting that a series of host-adapted genotypes/strains/species of the parasite exist. In this article, studies on the molecular characterisation of Cryptosporidium during the last 5 years are reviewed and put into perspective with {{the past and present}} taxonomy of the genus. The predictive value of achieving a sound taxonomy for the genus Cryptosporidium with respect to understanding its epidemiology and transmission and controlling outbreaks of the disease is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The best {{correlate}} {{of malaria}} severity in human Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) infection {{is the total}} parasite load. Pf-infected humans could control parasite loads by two mechanisms, either decreasing parasite multiplication, or increasing parasite clearance. However, few studies have directly measured these two mechanisms in vivo. Here, we have directly quantified host clearance of parasites during Plasmodium infection in mice. We transferred labelled red blood cells (RBCs) from Plasmodium infected donors into uninfected and infected recipients, and tracked the fate of donor parasites by frequent blood sampling. We then applied age-based mathematical models to <b>characterise</b> <b>parasite</b> clearance in the recipient mice. Our analyses revealed an increased clearance of parasites in infected animals, particularly parasites of a younger developmental stage. However, the major decrease in parasite multiplication in infected mice was not mediated by increased clearance alone, but {{was accompanied by a}} significant reduction in the susceptibility of RBCs to parasitisation...|$|R
40|$|Crustacean intersexuality is {{widespread}} and often linked to infection by sex-distorting parasites. However, unlike vertebrate intersexuality, {{its association with}} sexual dysfunction is unclear and remains a matter of debate. The ‘Demon Shrimp,’ Dikerogammarus haemobaphes, an amphipod that has invaded continental waterways, has recently become widespread in Britain. Intersexuality has been noted in D. haemobaphes but not investigated further. We hypothesise that a successful invasive population should not display a high prevalence of intersexuality if this condition represents a truly dysfunctional phenotype. In addition, experiments have indicated that particular parasite burdens in amphipods may facilitate invasions. The rapid and ongoing invasion of British waterways represents an opportunity to determine whether these hypotheses are consistent with field observations. This study investigates the parasites and sexual phenotypes of D. haemobaphes in British waterways, <b>characterising</b> <b>parasite</b> burdens using molecular screening, and makes comparisons with the threatened Gammarus pulex natives. We reveal that invasive and native populations have distinct parasitic profiles, suggesting the loss of G. pulex may have parasite-mediated eco-system impacts. Furthermore, the parasite burdens {{are consistent with those}} previously proposed to facilitate biological invasions. Our study also indicates that while no intersexuality occurs in the native G. pulex, approximately 50 % of D. haemobaphes males present pronounced intersexuality associated with infection by the microsporidian Dictyocoela berillonum. This unambiguously successful invasive population presents, to our knowledge, the highest reported prevalence of male intersexuality. This is the clearest evidence to date that such intersexuality does not represent a form of debilitating sexual dysfunction that negatively impacts amphipod populations...|$|R
40|$|Ketotifen has {{recently}} been reported to inhibit the growth of both asexual and sexual malaria parasites. A parasite transporter, PfgABCG 2, has been implicated in its mechanism of action. Human dihydrofolate reductase (hDHFR) is {{the most commonly used}} selectable marker to create transgenic Plasmodium falciparum cell lines. Growth assays using transgenic P.  falciparum parasites with different selectable markers revealed that the presence of hDHFR rather than the absence of PfgABCG 2 is responsible for a shift in the parasite's sensitivity to ketotifen. Employing a range of in vitro assays and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry we show that ketotifen influences hDHFR activity, but it is not metabolised by the enzyme. Our data also highlights potential pitfalls when functionally <b>characterising</b> transgenic <b>parasites...</b>|$|R
40|$|The growth {{phenotype}} of asexual blood stage malaria parasites {{can influence}} their virulence and also {{their ability to}} survive and achieve transmission to the next host, but there are few methods available to <b>characterise</b> <b>parasite</b> growth parameters in detail. We developed a new assay to measure growth rates at different starting parasitaemias in a 96 -well format and applied it to characterise the growth of Plasmodium falciparum lines 3 D 7 -A and 3 D 7 -B, previously shown to have different invasion rates and to use different invasion pathways. Using this simple and accurate assay we found that 3 D 7 -B is more sensitive to high initial parasitaemia than 3 D 7 -A. This result indicates that different parasite lines show variation in their levels of density-dependent growth inhibition. We also developed a new assay to compare {{the duration of the}} asexual blood cycle between different parasite lines. The assay is based on the tight synchronisation of cultures to a 1 h parasite age window and the subsequent monitoring of schizont bursting and formation of new rings by flow cytometry. Using this assay we observed differences in the duration of the asexual blood cycle between parasite lines 3 D 7 and HB 3. These two new assays will be useful to characterise variation in growth-related parameters and to identify growth phenotypes associated with the targeted deletion of specific genes or with particular genomic, transcriptomic or proteomic patterns. Furthermore, the identification of density-dependent growth inhibition as an intrinsic parasite property that varies between parasite lines expands the repertoire of measurable growth-related phenotypic traits that have the potential to influence the outcome of a malarial blood infection...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{endangered}} status of African painted dogs (Lycaon pictus) {{it is important}} to understand what parasitic diseases they are exposed to and what effect these are having on the rapidly declining wild populations. Conversely, zoo collections of these animals are under different pressures due to their captive lifestyle such as stress, nutrition, inbreeding and intensive housing. Faecal samples were collected from captive populations housed at Perth Zoo, Monarto and Adelaide Zoos and DeWildt Wildlife Trust in South Africa. Wild populations have been sampled from Zambia and Namibia with further sampling to be undertaken Zimbabwe and South Africa. Samples have been analysed via microscopy and parasites observed identified to genus. Giardia cysts and Spirometra sp. were detected in captive populations while parasite eggs of Taeniidae, Ancylostomatidae and Sarcocystis were detected in the wild populations. Molecular characterisation was then conducted in order to <b>characterise</b> those <b>parasites</b> found. Of particular interest is the zoonotic potential of the Giardia sp. detected in captive animals and the determination of Echinococcus sp. from the Taeniid ova found.

40|$|The {{flat oyster}} Ostrea chilensis is {{susceptible}} to infection with two microcells, Bonamia exitiosa and Bonamia ostreae. A haemocytic parasite very similar to Bonamia species has been previously reported in two of 167 Chilean oysters sampled from Chiloe Island in 1996 - 1997. In order to <b>characterise</b> the <b>parasite,</b> 46 and 120 two-years-old oysters were sampled {{in the same area}} in 2001 and 2004, respectively, and analysed by histology. The presence of Bonamia-like parasite was noted in 20 % and 10 % of animals respectively. No significant mortality was reported despite high levels of parasitic cells in most infected oysters. Some oysters found to be infected in 2001 and 2004 were selected for molecular analysis, including partial sequencing of 18 S and ITS regions of the rDNA gene cluster. On the basis of the obtained sequences, the parasite appears closely related, but distinct from Bonamia exitiosa and Bonamia ostreae. This strongly suggests the existence of a new species of Bonamia in Ostrea chilensis. However, arguments pertaining to ultrastructure of the parasite and its pathogenesis in O. chilensis need to be considered to complete the definition of this potential new species and to determine the impact of the haemocytic parasite on the Chilean production of flat oysters...|$|R
40|$|Faecal {{material}} from 169 individuals of Microcebus murinus living in five littoral forest fragments was analyzed for gastrointestinal parasites. The fragments differed {{in size and}} forest quality. Gastrointestinal parasite infection of M. murinus was <b>characterised</b> using <b>parasite</b> species richness, the prevalence of parasites, {{and the intensity of}} infection expressed as the number of parasite eggs, larvae and cysts per gram of faeces. For this, a modification of the McMaster flotation egg counting technique was applied to analyze egg shedding. We recorded nine gastrointestinal parasite species in faecal samples of Microcebus murinus. In good quality forest lemurs from a smaller fragment had higher prevalences and intensities of infection of gastrointestinal nematodes and protozoans than animals from a larger forest fragment. In large forests, excretion of eggs from Ascarididae and tapeworms was higher in a degraded forest fragment than in a good quality forest fragment. This situation wasreversed in small forest fragments with fewer eggs of Suburula nematodes and protozoans shed by lemurs in the degraded fragment than by lemurs from the good quality fragment. Our analyses are hampered by {{the fact that we had}} only one forest fragment per type of treatment. Keeping this limitation in mind, the results are consistent with other studies and indicate that forest degradation and fragmentation have marked effects on the level of parasitism of Madagascar’s lemurs...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, {{ecological}} factors, combined with everchanging landscapes mainly linked to human activities (e. g. encroachment and tourism) have contributed to modifications in the transmission of parasitic diseases from domestic to wildlife carnivores and vice versa.

In this second and final part, we focus our attention on parasitic diseases caused by helminth and arthropod parasites shared between domestic and wild canids and felids in Europe. While a complete understanding of the biology, ecology and epidemiology of these parasites is particularly challenging to achieve, especially given {{the complexity of the}} environments in which these diseases perpetuate, advancements in current knowledge of transmission routes is crucial to provide policy-makers with clear indications on strategies to reduce the impact of these diseases on changing ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Parasites of the Leishmania Viannia {{subgenus}} {{are major}} causative agents of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL), a disease <b>characterised</b> by <b>parasite</b> dissemination (metastasis) {{from the original}} cutaneous lesion to form debilitating secondary lesions in the nasopharyngeal mucosa. We employed a protein profiling approach to identify potential metastasis factors in laboratory clones of L. (V.) guyanensis with stable phenotypes ranging from highly metastatic (M+) through infrequently metastatic (M+/M-) to non-metastatic (M-). Comparison of the soluble proteomes of promastigotes by two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed two abundant protein spots specifically associated with M+ and M+/M- clones (Met 2 and Met 3) and two others exclusively expressed in M- parasites (Met 1 and Met 4). The association between clinical disease phenotype and differential expression of Met 1 -Met 4 was less clear in L. Viannia strains from mucosal (M+) or cutaneous (M-) lesions of patients. Identification of Met 1 -Met 4 by biological mass spectrometry (LC-ES-MS/MS) and bioinformatics revealed that M+ and M- clones express distinct acidic and neutral isoforms of both elongation factor- 1 subunit beta (EF- 1 beta) and cytosolic tryparedoxin peroxidase (TXNPx). This interchange of isoforms may relate to the mechanisms by which the activities of EF- 1 beta and TXNPx are modulated, and/or differential post-translational modification of the gene product(s). The multiple metabolic functions of EF- 1 and TXNPx support the plausibility of their participation in parasite survival and persistence and thereby, metastatic disease. Both polypeptides are active in resistance to chemical and oxidant stress, providing a basis for further elucidation {{of the importance of}} antioxidant defence in the pathogenesis underlying MCL...|$|R
40|$|Diseases {{caused by}} parasites are {{responsible}} for immense human and animal suffering, declines in biodiversity, and substantial economic losses across the globe. It is therefore important to understand how parasites spread through and persist within natural populations, so that control interventions that aim to reduce individual infection risk can be designed and implemented appropriately. Crucially, most parasites exist within multi-host communities, and often appear to infect multiple sympatric species, all of which potentially {{play a role in}} parasite persistence. However, certain species may contribute disproportionately to transmission and be nearly completely responsible for the persistence of a parasite within a community. Identifying such “key hosts” therefore offers a means to appropriately target control interventions to maximise success. However, assessing host species contributions to parasite transmission within multi-host communities is a challenging task, and much insight can be gained from studies of model host-parasite systems. In this thesis, the transmission dynamics responsible for the persistence of several endemic Bartonella parasites (bacterial flea-borne haemoparasites) are investigated within wild sympatric populations of wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) and bank voles (Myodes glareolus) in northwest England. Bartonella infections were first identified to species-level according to an existing method based on length polymorphism of a fragment of the 16 S- 23 S internal transcribed spacer region (ITS). Broad patterns of prevalence suggested that some species were host generalists while others were host-exclusive, indicating that different transmission dynamics underlie the persistence of each Bartonella species within the rodent community. Attempts to identify key transmission hosts for each Bartonella species based on the effect of past host population densities on infection risk proved inconclusive. However, finer-scale characterisation of Bartonella infections, using DNA sequencing, found that Bartonella species that appear to be generalists actually comprise a complex of genetic variants, the majority of which are host-specific, suggesting that transmission between host species is uncommon and limited to a relatively few host-shared variants. Furthermore, detailed characterisation of the flea community infecting wood mice and bank voles found that these Bartonella vectors were host-generalists, and that at least two flea species were able to transfer between individuals of different host species. This suggests that a lack of between-species transmission is likely to arise through different compatibility between host species and Bartonella variants, rather than as a result of current ecological encounter barriers (e. g. through differential Bartonella-flea or flea-rodent specificity). The results of an experimental manipulation of between-species transmission within these wild communities support the notion that between-species transmission of Bartonella parasites is uncommon. Across three woodland sites, bank voles were treated with a veterinary insecticide to remove their fleas and therefore reduce the rate of transmission of Bartonella from treated bank voles {{to the rest of the}} rodent community. Following treatment, risk of bank vole infection with bank vole-exclusive Bartonella variants was reduced, but there was no affect on the risk of bank vole infection with host-shared variants, nor risk of infection in wood mice with either wood mouse-exclusive or host-shared variants. Importantly, these treatment effects were best identified by grouping the parasites on a ‘functional’ (i. e. host-exclusive versus host-shared variants) rather than a taxonomic (i. e. Bartonella species) basis. Together, these findings highlight the importance of <b>characterising</b> <b>parasite</b> infections to as fine a scale as possible, and the value of using a combination of observation, genetic and experimental approaches to understand parasite transmission within complex natural multi-host systems...|$|R
40|$|Background: Arthropods are {{infected}} {{by a wide}} diversity of maternally transmitted microbes. Some of these manipulate host reproduction to facilitate population invasion and persistence. Such parasites transmit vertically on an ecological timescale, but rare horizontal transmission events have permitted colonisation of new species.

Results: We employed a well <b>characterised</b> reproductive <b>parasite,</b> a coccinellid beetle male-killer, and artificially injected the bacterium into a series of novel species. Genetic distances between native and novel hosts were ascertained by sequencing sections of the 16 S and 12 S mitochondrial rDNA genes. The bacterium colonised host tissues and transmitted vertically in all cases tested. However, whilst transmission efficiency was perfect within the native genus, this was reduced following some transfers of greater phylogenetic distance. The bacterium's ability to distort offspring sex ratios in novel hosts was negatively correlated with the genetic distance of transfers. Male-killing occurred with full penetrance following within-genus transfers; but whilst sex ratio distortion generally occurred, it was incomplete in more distantly related species. Conclusion: This study indicates that the natural interspecific transmission of reproductive parasites might be constrained by their ability to tolerate the physiology or genetics of novel hosts. Our data suggest that horizontal transfers are more likely between closely related species.

Captive management practices may alter host-parasite ecology, driving the emergence of disease in species of commercial or conservation significance. The development of sustainable, integrated techniques for the control of potentially pathogenic taxa requires {{an understanding of the}} factors influencing parasite transmission, establishment and intracommunity competition in captive environments. In this study, the community dynamics of parasitic nematodes (suborders; Trichocephalatina and Strongylida) were examined under two captive management regimes; intensively farmed saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylusporosus) and non-commercial populations of red kangaroos (Macropus rufus). Four aspects of parasite ecology were investigated; genetic diversity within nematode populations, the role of extrinsic environmental factors in mediating nematode-associated helminthosis, the development of high-throughput molecular methods for <b>characterising</b> <b>parasite</b> communities and structuring of nematode assemblages within and between conspecific host populations. 18 S ribosomal RNA gene sequences (n= 55) were obtained from Paratrichosoma sp (nematoda: Trichosomoididae) eggs present in the epidermis of C. porosus. The level of genetic diversity distributed within the Paratrichosoma sp population was relatively high (241 variable positions in the 1094 bp alignment), suggesting that rates of nucleotide basepair substitution are accelerated in this genus of nematodes. A significant negative linear relationship (P= 0. 011, R 2 = 0. 327) was identified between mean monthly rainfall and the monthly incidence of Paratrichosoma-associated helminthosis. The accuracy with which terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis, was capable of distinguishing between the constituent taxa of macropodid parasite communities was assessed by comparing sequence data from ~ 20 species of nematode (suborder Strongylida). Our results demonstrate that, with fluorescent labelling of the forward and reverse terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) of the ITS+ rDNA region, the restriction endonuclease Hinf 1 was capable of generating species specific T-RFLP profiles. A notable exception was within the genus Cloacina, in which closely related species often shared identical T-RFs. This may be a consequence of the group’s comparatively recent evolutionary radiation. The strongylid nematode communities of M. rufus were characterised across seven captive sites, using T-RFLP and Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencing of the ITS 2 locus. The prevalence (P=< 0. 001) and mean intensity (df= 6, F= 17. 494, P=< 0. 001) of strongylid nematode infection differed significantly between the sites. Significant levels of parasite community structure were observed (ANOSIM, P = 0. 01), with most of the variation being distributed within, rather than between, captive sites. The range of nematode taxa that occured in captive red kangaroos appeared to differ from that of wild conspecifics, with representatives of the genus Cloacina, a dominant nematode parasite of the macropodid forestomach, being detected at only two of the seven study sites. This study also provides the first evidence for the presence of the genus Trichostrongylus in a macropodid marsupial. Our results demonstrate that contemporary species management practices may exert a profound influence on the structure of parasite communities in captive systems. Results from this thesis demonstrate a strong anthropogenic influence on the structure of nematode assemblages in captive host populations. Studies of this nature will {{contribute to the development of}} more effective captive management practices by elucidating the factors influencing community structure and infection dynamics in a group of parasites that can exert a profound influence on the health and viability of their host populations.

As natural regulatory T (T(reg)) cells are identified as an immunosuppressive lineage able to modulate the magnitude of effector responses, several studies have investigated whether this cell population plays a role in balancing protective immunity and pathogenesis during malaria.

The second stage of the disease is <b>characterised</b> by the <b>parasites</b> entering the brain. It is therefore important that sleeping sickness therapies are able to cross the blood-brain barrier. At present, only three medications for chemotherapy of the second stage of the disease are available. As these trypanocides have serious side effects and are difficult to administer, new and safe anti-trypanosomal brain-penetrating drugs are needed. For these reasons, the anti-glioblastoma drug temozolomide was tested in vitro for activity against bloodstream forms of T. brucei. The concentration of the drug required to reduce the growth rate of the parasites by 50 % was 29. 1 μM and to kill all trypanosomes was 125 μM. Importantly, temozolomide did not affect the growth of human HL- 60 cells up to a concentration of 300 μM. Cell cycle analysis revealed that temozolomide induced DNA damage and subsequent cell cycle arrest in trypanosomes exposed to the compound. As drug combination regimes often achieve greater therapeutic efficacy than monotherapies, the interactions of temozolomide with the trypanocides eflornithine and melarsoprol, respectively, was determined. Both combinations were found to produce an additive effect.

[Methods] In the present study, we characterised morphologically and molecularly the hemococcidian parasites (sporozoites) that infect three lizard hosts from North America and two from South America. [Results] In total, we generated 12 new 18 S rRNA gene sequences of hemococcidian parasites infecting New World lizard hosts. By the microscopic examination of the smears we identified Schellackia golvani Rogier & Landau, 1975 (ex Anolis carolinensis Voigt) and Schellackia occidentalis Bonorris & Ball, 1955 (ex Uta stansburiana Baird & Girard and Sceloporus occidentalis Baird & Girard) in some samples, but the phylogenetic analysis indicated that all 18 S rDNA sequences are distant from Schellackia species found in Old World lizards. In fact, the hemococcidian parasites detected in the New World lizards (including S. occidentalis and S. golvani) were {{closely related to the}} genus Lankesterella Labbé, 1899. Consequently, we suggest these two species to be included within the genus Lankesterella. [Conclusions] Life history traits of hemococcidian parasites such as the type of host blood cells infected, host species or number of refractile bodies are not valid diagnostic characteristics to differentiate the parasites between the genera Schellackia and Lankesterella. Indeed, lankesterellid parasites with a different number of refractile bodies had a close phylogenetic origin. Based on the phylogenetic results we provide a systematic revision of the North American hemococcidians. Our recommendation is to include the species formerly described in the genus Schellackia that infect American lizards into Lankesterella (Lankesterellidae) as Lankesterella golvani (Rogier & Landau, 1975) n. comb and L. occidentalis (Bonorris & Ball, 1955) n. comb.

40|$|Background: Parasitic worms {{represent}} a substantial disease burden in {{animals and humans}} worldwide. The control of parasitic roundworms (nematodes) relies heavily {{on the use of}} anthelmintic drugs. However, widespread drug resistance in nematodes seriously compromises the effectiveness of many anthelmintics around the world. Thus, {{there is a need to}} discover new drugs, with unique modes of action, against parasites. Methods: Here, we synthesised and tested 74 selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) for in vitro-activity on parasitic larvae of Haemonchus contortus (barber’s pole worm), one of the most important nematode pathogens of small ruminants (including sheep and goats) and a key representative of one of the largest groups of parasitic nematodes (the Strongylida) of animals. We also studied the morphology of treated and untreated larvae using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and assessed the agonistic/antagonistic activity of SERMs in a human embryonic kidney cell line using a luciferase reporter assay system. Results: We identified three SERMs (one selenophene and two thiophene-core compounds) with potent inhibitory activities (at 3 – 25 μM) on the motility and development of parasitic stages of H. contortus. An SEM examination of treated H. contortus revealed considerable damage to the cuticle of fourth- but not exsheathed, third-stage larvae; this damage appeared to be consistent with that observed upon treatment with monepantel but not moxidectin (control compounds). Conclusion: The potency of the three SERMs compared favourably with commercially available anthelmintics, such that they warrant further assessment as nematocides. Future studies could focus on assessing the selectivity of these SERMs to <b>parasites,</b> <b>characterising</b> their target(s) and/or designing analogs that are parasite-specific. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|A {{molecular}} {{survey was}} conducted to provide baseline information on the prevalence, genetic diversity and potential clinical impacts of blood-borne and enteric protozoans in native wild mammals from the Northern Territory (NT). A total of 209 blood and 167 faecal samples were collected from four target species; the northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus), common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus) and brush-tailed rabbit-rat (Conilurus penicillatus). Blood samples were screened by PCR at the 18 S rRNA gene for trypanosomes, piroplasms and haemogregarines, with faecal samples tested for Cryptosporidium spp. at the 18 S rRNA locus, and for Giardia spp. at the glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) and 18 S rRNA loci. The potential clinical impact was investigated by associating clinical, haematological and biochemical parameters with {{presence or absence of}} infection. Overall, 22. 5 % (95 % CI: 17. 0 - 28. 8 %) of the animals tested were positive for haemoprotozoans. Trypanosomes were found in 26. 6 % (95 % CI: 18. 7 - 35. 7 %) of the bandicoots and were identified as Trypanosoma vegrandis G 6, except for one unique genotype, most similar to T. vegrandis G 3 (genetic distance = 7 %). The prevalence of trypanosomes in possums was 23. 7 % (95 % CI: 11. 4 - 40. 2 %), and the genotypes identified clustered within the T. noyesi clade. The presence of Babesia sp. and Hepatozoon sp. was confirmed in bandicoots only, both at a prevalence of 9. 7 % (95 % CI: 2. 7 - 9. 2 %). The total prevalence of intestinal protozoan parasites observed was relatively low (3 %; 95 % CI: 1. 0 - 6. 9 %). No evidence of clinical disease associated with protozoan parasitic infection was observed, however bandicoots positive for Trypanosoma exhibited a significantly lower packed cell volume (PCV) compared to negative bandicoots (p = 0. 046). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first research conducted in the NT to <b>characterise</b> protozoan <b>parasites</b> in threatened native mammals using both molecular and morphological tools; and to assess the potential clinical impacts of these agents. The absence of clear signs of major morbidity in infected animals seems to exclude a direct association between infections with these agents and possible population decline events in northern Australian native mammals. However until the cause(s) of population decline are ascertained for each individual mammal species, further studies are required. The outcome of the present investigation may be used to inform wildlife conservation and zoonotic disease programs...|$|R
40|$|Available {{evidence}} suggests that, in African populations, systemic blood-dwelling parasitoses of mothers {{are associated with}} enhanced susceptibility to infection of their offspring. Thus, children born to mothers with filariasis or schistosomiasis are infected earlier, and offspring of mothers with placental Plasmodium falciparum at delivery, {{commonly referred to as}} pregnancy-associated malaria or PAM, are themselves at higher risk of developing parasitaemia during infancy. Since foetal/neonatal antigen-presenting cells (APC) are either immature or provide insufficient costimulatory signals to T cells, thus favouring tolerance induction, it is commonly assumed that soluble parasite components [protein antigens], transferred transplacentally and inducing foetal immune tolerance, are largely, if not exclusively, responsible for these outcomes. Plasmodial asexual blood stage antigen-specific T cells are detectable in as many as two-thirds of all cord blood samples in malaria-endemic countries of sub-Saharan Africa, indicating that in utero sensitization may be a common phenomenon during pregnancy in these populations. Parasite antigen-specific T cell responses of neonates born to helminth-infected mothers display a highly skewed Th 2 -type cytokine pattern, with a prominent role for the regulatory cytokine interleukin (IL) - 10. Similarly, the cord blood immune response of those born to mothers identified with on-going PAM is <b>characterised</b> by inducible <b>parasite</b> antigen-specific IL- 10 -producing regulatory T cells that can inhibit both APC HLA expression and Th 1 -type T cell responses. In contrast, plasmodial antigen-specific Th 1 -type responses, characterised by IFN-gamma production, predominate in cord blood of those born to mothers successfully treated for Pf malaria during gestation, suggesting that the duration and/or the nature of antigen exposure in utero governs the outcome with respect to neonatal immune responses. Aspects of APC function in the context of these differentially modulated responses, whether and how the latter translate into altered susceptibility to Pf infection during infancy, as well as the possible implications for vaccination in early life, are aspects that are discussed in this review...|$|R
40|$|The {{most severe}} form of malaria in humans {{is caused by}} the {{intracellular}} parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The African continent bears the greatest burden of malaria with 90 % of all malaria deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa where the high risk populations include pregnant woman and {{children under the age of}} five. Fatal cases of malaria are often a result of the progression of the disease to a life threatening syndrome where intravenous quinine or artesunate are administered as an emergency treatment, however a 15 - 20 % mortality rate is still observed among treated individuals. Pathogenesis of severe malaria is associated with the mature or late trophozoite stage of the parasite s intra-erythrocyte life cycle. At this stage the intracellular parasite expresses parasite derived proteins on the surface of the red blood cell (RBCs) that bind to host endothelial receptors. This cytoadhesion ultimately allows the parasite to multiply unhindered by the host resulting in high parasitaemia levels which is associated with the extent of the symptoms associated with severe malaria. There is currently no effective vaccine available for malaria and available antimalarial drugs are often compromised by rapidly developing drug resistance. Therefore there is an urgent need to identify novel drug targets for the treatment of severe malaria and to explore therapeutic agents that can be used as adjuncts to the currently available anti-malarial drugs. Statins, also known as 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, have been identified as a potential adjunctive therapy for severe malaria due to their pleiotropic effects which include anti-cytoadhesive activity. The aim of this study was to <b>characterise</b> cytoadhesive related <b>parasite</b> proteins that are expressed on the surface of parasitised RBCs and then to assess the effects of a classic statin, lovastatin, on these parasite proteins. This was done in order to provide improved insight and extend existing knowledge on the potential role statins may have in treating severe malaria. The P. falciparum 3 D 7 strain was efficiently synchronised and cultured according to standard culturing procedures and selective harvesting provided a 90 % enrichment of narrowly synchronised cultures at the late trophozoite stage (35 - 40 hours post invasion). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to successfully illustrate parasite induced morphological changes to the surface of parasitised RBCs which included parasitic knob structures, a characteristic feature of severe malaria. Isolation of membranes of equivalent RBCs and parasitised RBCs that were untreated and treated with 10 ?M of lovastatin was optimised and surface proteins were fractionated using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Bands of interest that were visually apparent on Stain Free imaged gels and Coomassie brilliant blue stained gels were excised and in-gel trypsinised followed by peptide sequencing by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Advanced proteomic software was then used to successfully confirm the identity of key RBC structural membrane proteins as well as several parasite surface proteins, such as P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP 1), P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 3 (PfEMP 3), P. falciparum knob associated histidine rich protein (PfKAHRP), P. falciparum mature infected erythrocyte surface antigen (PfMESA) and P. falciparum cytoadhesion linked asexual gene (PfCLAG) proteins. These cytoadhesive related proteins were identified on the membranes of parasitised RBCs that were treated with lovastatin thus suggesting that although lovastatin has the ability to retard cytoadhesion it is apparently not through the inhibition of expression of parasite derived adhesion proteins. The study also highlighted the need for stringent controls when using label-free proteomics to assess differential protein expression. The effects of lovastatin on protein abundance were inconclusive due to the low abundance of these proteins. This study demonstrated the potential of combining pharmacological studies with advanced proteomic techniques where the effects of physiological relevant concentrations of a drug were successfully assessed at the parasite protein expression level.

40|$|Abstract To start a {{successful}} infection, pathogens need {{to cross the}} physical barriers lining our body, the epithelia (skin; respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital mocosae). However, epithelia are not inert physical barriers, and within the epithelia the pathogen will encounter the first active defense system of the host. Among {{the cells of the}} immune system patrolling epithelial linings, an important role is represented by resident macrophages. Upon contact with different types of pathogens, macrophages can undergo a polarised pattern of activation and start secreting various factors to recruit and activate other cells of the immune system such as blood monocytes, neutrophils, dendritic cells, natural killer cells and lymphocytes. The innate immune system is most of the times able to block an infection without the need of an adaptative response. Innate immune cell receptors can recognise moleculear patterns characteristic of microbes and become activated to directly eliminate the invading pathogen. If an adaptative response is necessary, it is the innate immune system that triggers this activation: cells of the innate immunity present the antigen to lymphocytes and keep the pathogen in the infection site while the organism sets up the adaptative response. Cells of the innate immune system have different roles during a pathogenic infection. Neutrophils are specialised phagocytic cells that usually die during the infection. Dendritic cells leave the site of inflammation after uptake of pathogen and reach the lymph nodes where they present the antigen to lymphocytes. Resident macrophages are present in the site of infection and are the first to come in contact with the pathogens. Activated macrophages secrete bactericidal molecules, can directly engulf and destroy pathogens and initiate the inflammatory reaction that limits and stops the infection. Indeed, pathogen-activated macrophages produce chemokines that attract to the site of infection inflammatory leukocytes from the blood (PMN, monocytes) and cytokines that activate the recruited leukocytes. When the infection is stopped and pathogens destroyed, the inflammatory activation of macrophages and recruited monocytes in the reaction site stops, and cells react to the microenvironmental change by producing factors that promote tissue repair, cell proliferation and angiogenesis in the damaged tissue, thus re-establishing tissue homeostasis. Blood monocytes recruited to the site of infection can initiate two different types of activation programmes depending on the characteristics of the infectious/inflamatory event. Classical inflammatory cytocidal activation (M 1 polarisation) is triggered by recognition of bacterial or viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and amplified {{in the presence of the}} pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-gamma produced by NK cells and T lymphocytes. M 1 macrophages are potent producers of inflammatory factors (e. g., the cytokines IL- 1 beta, IL- 12, TNF-alpha) and chemokines (IL- 8, MCP- 1, MIP- 1 alpha, MIP- 1 beta, etc.), reactive oxygen species and nitrogen monoxide. M 1 polarisation increases the phagocytic activity of macrophages and phagosome acidification, increasing ingestion and destruction of pathogens. On the other hand, the M 2 polarisation is induced by different types of pathogens/stimuli (e. g. helmints) and it can be defined as a “non-M 1 ”. M 2 macrophages have diverse characteristics but have in common low production of IL- 12 and IL- 23 and high production of IL- 10. At least three different types of M 2 polarisation have been described. One is the alternative inflammatory activation (very different from M 1) that is initiated in response to invasion by worms and <b>parasites,</b> <b>characterised</b> by the production of alternative inflammatory factors (such as IL- 4) in parallel to the production of factors that down-regulate classical inflammation (such as IL- 10 and IL- 1 Ra). Another one is a non-classical inflammatory activation with concomitant production of classical inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory factors, while a last group of alternatively activated M 2 types can be considered as “de-activated” M 2 polarisation and generally include lower production of classical inflammatory molecules, and concomitant promotion of angiogenesis and tissue remodelling. The aim of this work is to build and validate an in vitro model system that simulates the key steps of the inflammatory reaction, from pathogen-induced triggering to eventual resolution and re-establishment of homeostasis. The system is based on human blood monocytes and on their M 1 and M 2 polarisation in response to prototypical stimuli simulating the conditions of the tissue microenvironment during the various phases of the inflammatory process. During the in vitro reaction, samples of cells and supernatants will be taken at different time points, to be analysed with proteomics and transcriptomics platforms. Particolar attention will be devoted to the study of the cytokines and receptors of the IL- 1 family. IL- 1 -like cytokines include eleven cytokines involved both in the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. It is known that defects in the regulation of IL- 1 cytokine production/activity correlate with the development of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crhon’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. While high-throughput transcriptomics and proteomics studies (by microarrays and mass spectrometry) are still underway, in this work we present preliminary data aimed at confirming the robustness of the in vitro model system and its representativity of the inflamamtory reaction. Moreover we present the first data describing the modulation of the of IL- 1 /IL- 1 R molecules in macrophages during all phases of inflammation in our model system...|$|R
