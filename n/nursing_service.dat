5|$|In 1944, David O. Selznick's Vanguard Films {{produced}} a short film, Reward Unlimited, {{to promote the}} Cadet Nurse Corps. Starring Dorothy McGuire {{in one of her}} first films, and directed by Jacques Tourneur, the 10-minute film was exhibited in theaters and at Cadet Nurse Corps recruitment events in 1944 and 1945. The story, by Mary C. McCall, Jr., dramatizes the choice that young Peggy Adams makes to become a nurse, her training, and her volunteering for military <b>nursing</b> <b>service.</b> The cast includes Aline MacMahon, James Brown, Spring Byington and Tom Tully.|$|E
5|$|The Territorial Force now {{constituted}} 204 infantry battalions (ten {{of which}} were organised as bicycle infantry) and 56 Yeomanry regiments, organised into fourteen divisions and fourteen cavalry brigades, along with associated support troops. A new all-Territorial regiment, the London Regiment, was formed to encompass twenty-seven battalions which had previously been associated with various regular regiments. The divisional troops were raised and administered by the County Associations, whilst the divisions themselves were operationally commanded by regular staff officers. Outside of the divisional structure, a Territorial Medical Corps was created, followed by a Territorial Association <b>Nursing</b> <b>Service.</b>|$|E
5|$|Women also volunteered {{and served}} in a {{non-combatant}} role; {{by the end of}} the war, 80,000 had enlisted. They mostly served as nurses in the Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military <b>Nursing</b> <b>Service</b> (QAIMNS), the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY), the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD); and from 1917, in the Army when the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC), was founded. The WAAC was divided into four sections: cookery; mechanical; clerical and miscellaneous. Most stayed on the Home Front, but around 9,000 served in France.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: {{this article}} looks {{at how the}} {{development}} of community <b>nursing</b> <b>services</b> in China and Hong Kong can enhance universal health coverage. Methods: literature and data review have been utilized in this study. Results: <b>nursing</b> <b>services</b> have evolved much {{since the beginning of}} the nursing profession. The development of community <b>nursing</b> <b>services</b> has expanded the scope of <b>nursing</b> <b>services</b> to those in need of, not just hospital-level nursing care, but more holistic care to improve health and quality of life. Conclusion: despite the one-country-two-systems governance and the difference in population and geography, Hong Kong and China both face the aging population and its complications. Community <b>nursing</b> <b>services</b> help to pave the road to Universal Health Coverage...|$|R
40|$|The {{teaching}} of diagnostics in <b>nurse</b> <b>service</b> through problematical pedagogy. The present study has the goal to analyse {{the implementation of}} the offer in teaching the diagnostics of <b>nurse</b> <b>service</b> according to toxomony I of NANDA, through problematical pedagogy, made real by arch method. A feat research was developed a Faculdade of <b>nurse</b> <b>service</b> of Universidade Federal de Goiás in 1998, close to the sophomores of graduation in <b>nurse</b> <b>service.</b> The collect of data were carried out through activities reports, registry of campus and cognitive and affective instruments of evaluation, on the cognitive evaluation, through the written test, the group got an average of 24, 1 and 47, 5 for a maximum of a hundred points on the first and second evaluation respectively on the report of practical activities, the score got for more than 78 per cent of the diagnostics of <b>nurse</b> <b>service</b> evaluated were from medium excellent (three to five). The feat developed for the teaching allowed that all students perceived the reality that if they were put at the place of <b>nurse</b> <b>service,</b> exercising the critical analyse of reality and the role as an agent of transformation, we understood it is possible to teach <b>nurse</b> <b>service</b> diagnostics through problematical pedagogy...|$|R
40|$|<b>Nursing</b> <b>services</b> {{represent}} {{a large part}} of health service resources that trigger health care costs and in-comes. Conservative estimates suggest that nurses represent 30 % of total hospital expenditures without in-vestments. Currently, clinical nursing knowledge management is not supported by the most appropriate supportive business and technical solutions. Improvement to <b>nursing</b> <b>services,</b> through collaborative research activity that engages both academics and clinicians, should be underpinned by a conceptual framework to facilitate knowledge capture and sharing. We propose a <b>nursing</b> <b>services</b> research framework to guide and improve the delivery of <b>nursing</b> <b>services</b> to achieve a sustainable health system. The framework supports development of interdisciplinary research and development activities through clinical and academic partner-ships...|$|R
5|$|From 1911 to 1941 {{women were}} {{forbidden}} from {{serving in the}} RAN; the demands World War II placed on personnel and resources led to a change of policy. On 21 April 1941, the Australian Naval Board sent a letter authorising the entry of women into the RAN to the Commodore-in-Charge, Sydney. The letter {{led to the formation}} of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service (WRANS) and the Royal Australian Naval <b>Nursing</b> <b>Service</b> (RANNS). The two separate women's services existed until 1984, when they were incorporated into the permanent force. Today, female members of the RAN have a wide variety of roles open to them; women serve on submarines, command ships and shore postings and are expected to play an increasingly important role in the future of the RAN.|$|E
5|$|During the Gallipoli Campaign four {{light horse}} brigades had been {{dismounted}} and fought alongside the infantry divisions. However, in March 1916 the ANZAC Mounted Division {{was formed in}} Egypt (so named because it contained one mounted brigade from New Zealand). Likewise, the Australian Mounted Division—formed in February 1917—was originally named the Imperial Mounted Division because it contained the British 5th and 6th Mounted Brigades. Each division consisted of three mounted light horse brigades, each of which consisted of three regiments. Following {{the expansion of the}} Desert Column in August 1917 these divisions formed part of the Desert Mounted Corps, which consisted of the ANZAC Mounted Division, Australian Mounted Division and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade (which included a number of Australian, British and New Zealand camel companies). The AIF also included the Australian Flying Corps (AFC), which consisted of four operational squadrons—Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4, and four training squadrons—Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8. More than 2,000 women served with the AIF, mainly in the Australian Army <b>Nursing</b> <b>Service.</b> In addition, a number of other specialist units were also raised, including tunnelling companies, motor transport units, railway, ordnance, workshops and service units, and hospitals and other specialist medical and dental units. One small armoured unit was also raised.|$|E
25|$|The Alberta District <b>Nursing</b> <b>Service</b> {{administered}} {{health care}} in the predominantly rural and impoverished areas of Alberta {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. Founded in 1919 to meet maternal and emergency medical needs by the United Farm Women of Alberta (UFWA), the <b>Nursing</b> <b>Service</b> treated prairie settlers living in primitive areas lacking doctors and hospitals. Nurses provided prenatal care, worked as midwives, performed minor surgery, conducted medical inspections of schoolchildren, and sponsored immunization programs. The post-World War II discovery of large oil and gas reserves resulted in economic prosperity and the expansion of local medical services. The passage of provincial health and universal hospital insurance in 1957 precipitated the eventual phasing out of the obsolete District <b>Nursing</b> <b>Service</b> in 1976.|$|E
40|$|The need to {{systematically}} and comprehensively manage {{data to support}} <b>nursing</b> <b>services</b> asserts itself in all areas and contexts where <b>nursing</b> <b>services</b> are delivered to patients and families. While most applications have targeted inpatient <b>nursing</b> <b>services,</b> several systems to sustain ambulatory nursing care have been proposed as well. In this paper, we outline the purpose and general structure of a custom-designed computerized database management system to support the clinical, administrative, and research operations of a geriatric nursing outreach program in rural Virginia...|$|R

25|$|For the Royal Navy, Royal Marines and the Dominion and Colonial naval forces, the {{criteria}} were 28 days mobilised service, {{but without a}} requirement for overseas service.

25|$|Many nurses saw {{active duty}} in World War I, but the {{profession}} was transformed {{during the second}} World War. British nurses of the Army <b>Nursing</b> <b>Service</b> were part of every overseas campaign. More nurses volunteered for service in the US Army and Navy than any other occupation. The Nazis had their own Brown Nurses, 40,000 strong. Two dozen German Red Cross nurses were awarded the Iron Cross for heroism under fire.|$|E
25|$|Within 48 {{hours of}} war being declared, the Corps {{was able to}} entirely staff all of Scotland's {{military}} hospitals, freeing the regular staff for service. In addition to this, St Andrew's were also able to assemble two Foreign Service Units (which served in France and in hospital ships), a Military <b>Nursing</b> <b>Service</b> (derived from females Corps members) and a transport service alongside the British Red Cross attending to wounded soldiers from hospital trains. Whilst {{all of this was}} happening, St Andrew's usual civilian work of first aid training and casualty transportation continued unabated (albeit the additional services placed strain on the Association's funds).|$|E

25|$|Women {{have served}} in Australian armed forces since 1899. Until World War II women were {{restricted}} to the Australian Army <b>Nursing</b> <b>Service.</b> This role expanded in 194142 when the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force established female branches in which women took {{on a range of}} support roles. While these organisations were disbanded {{at the end of the}} war, they were reestablished in 1950 as part of the military's permanent structure. Women were integrated into the services during the late 1970s and early 1980s and can now serve in most positions in the Australian Defence Force (ADF), including combat roles.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, the Princess Royal became chief controller and later controller commandant of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS, renamed the Women's Royal Army Corps in 1949). In that capacity she travelled Britain visiting its units, as well as wartime canteens and other welfare organisations. On {{the death of her}} younger brother, the Duke of Kent, she became the president of Papworth. The Princess Royal became air chief commandant of Princess Mary's Royal Air Force <b>Nursing</b> <b>Service</b> in 1950 and received the honorary rank of general in the British Army in 1956. Also, in 1949, the 10th Gurkha Rifles were renamed the 10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles in her honour.|$|E
25|$|On 8 February the Japanese {{invasion}} of Singapore began. Within days a British and Empire defeat was inevitable, and an evacuation of key personnel was begun.

Later he wrote that they included 1,573 RAF, British Army and Royal Navy personnel, 139 Australian Imperial Force personnel and 133 army nurses and signalling personnel. The nurses {{were members of the}} Australian Army <b>Nursing</b> <b>Service</b> from two Australian Army Medical Corps hospitals. Many of the signalling personnel, like the nurses, would have been women. The total number of women on the ship was 160 and there were also 35 children.|$|E

30|$|The {{analyses}} were performed separately for the two areas of the care sector: The operation of nursing homes {{for the elderly and}} the provision of domestic <b>nursing</b> <b>services.</b> The results show that despite a steady growth of the sector between 2003 and 2009, carers’ incomes have not increased. Furthermore, a concentration to larger facilities can be observed. This development leads to an increased competition for labour, which has not yet affected wages, because the market for <b>nursing</b> <b>services</b> is close to a monopsony. Therefore, the prices for <b>nursing</b> <b>services</b> have increased to a lesser extent than the annual inflation rate between 2003 and 2009.|$|R
