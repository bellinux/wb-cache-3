5|$|Because SI prefixes {{may not be}} {{concatenated}} (serially linked) {{within the}} <b>name</b> <b>or</b> symbol for a unit of measure, SI prefixes are used with the gram, not the kilogram, which already has a prefix {{as part of its}} name. For instance, one-millionth of a kilogram is 1mg (one milligram), not 1µkg (one microkilogram).|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{significance of}} the letters is unknown. Tafsir (exegesis) has interpreted them as abbreviations for either <b>names</b> <b>or</b> qualities of God <b>or</b> for the <b>names</b> <b>or</b> content of the respective surahs.|$|R

5|$|In 2015, Otherside Entertainment, a new {{developer}} {{founded by}} Paul Neurath and other Looking Glass and Irrational veterans, {{announced a new}} entry in the series, entitled Underworld Ascendant. The new title is an officially licensed part of the series set in the Stygian Abyss, but this licensing agreement does not extend to the Ultima <b>name</b> <b>or</b> greater IP, effectively orphaning Underworld from the Ultima series.|$|E
5|$|Mary Celeste was not {{the first}} {{reported}} case of a ship being found strangely deserted on the high seas. Rupert Gould, a naval officer and investigator of maritime mysteries, lists several such occurrences between 1840 and 1855. Whatever the truth of these stories, it is the Mary Celeste that is remembered; the ship's <b>name,</b> <b>or</b> the misspelt Marie Celeste, has become fixed in people's minds as synonymous with inexplicable desertion.|$|E

5|$|Researchers {{have looked}} for {{evidence}} of {{the driving force behind}} the name-letter effect outside the lab. A body of controversial research under the umbrella ofimplicit egotism, starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or name. Sceptics say that to claim that a <b>name</b> <b>or</b> name letters influences life decisions is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.|$|E

5|$|Baron Edmond de Sélys Longchamps {{coined the}} name Raphus solitarius for these birds in 1848, as he {{believed}} the accounts referred to a species of dodo. When 17th-century paintings of white dodos were discovered by 19th-century naturalists, it was assumed they depicted these birds. Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans suggested that {{the discrepancy between the}} paintings and the old descriptions was that the paintings showed females, and that the species was therefore sexually dimorphic. Some authors also believed the birds described were of a species similar to the Rodrigues solitaire, as it was referred to by the same <b>name,</b> <b>or</b> even that there were white species of both dodo and solitaire on the island.|$|E
5|$|Beiderbecke's most {{influential}} recordings date from {{his time with}} Goldkette and Whiteman, although they were generally recorded under his own <b>name</b> <b>or</b> Trumbauer's. The Whiteman period also marked a precipitous decline in Beiderbecke's health, {{brought on by the}} demand of the bandleader's relentless touring and recording schedule in combination with Beiderbecke's persistent alcoholism. A few stints in rehabilitation centers, as well as the support of Whiteman and the Beiderbecke family in Davenport, did not check Beiderbecke's decline in health. He left the Whiteman band in 1930 and the following summer died in his Queens apartment at the age of 28.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich was a {{prolific}} artist who {{produced more than}} 500 attributed works. In line with the Romantic ideals of his time, he intended his paintings to function as pure aesthetic statements, so he was cautious that the titles given to his work were not overly descriptive or evocative. It is likely that some of today's more literal titles, such as The Stages of Life, were not given by the artist himself, but were instead adopted {{during one of the}} revivals of interest in Friedrich. Complications arise when dating Friedrich's work, in part because he often did not directly <b>name</b> <b>or</b> date his canvases. He kept a carefully detailed notebook on his output, however, which has been used by scholars to tie paintings to their completion dates.|$|E

5|$|In {{recent years}} the Ritz has taken {{measures}} to enforce their trademark against infringement. Lawyers have notified competitors using the name to surrender their websites and Facebook accounts marketing under the trademark, {{even though they had}} been using these names for many years. The Desborough Ritz, which had been using the name since the 1930s, changed its name in 2012 after being advised by solicitors to do so. That same year, a Northamptonshire wedding location named The Ritz changed its name to the Banqueting & Conference Suites at the Kettering Ritz after another notification. The Brighouse Ritz, which has operated under the name since 1938, was notified in 2017 to change its <b>name</b> <b>or</b> face legal action.|$|E
5|$|Periyar viewed Christianity {{similar to}} the monotheistic faith of Islam. He {{explained}} that their faith says {{that there can be}} only one God which has no <b>name</b> <b>or</b> shape. Periyar took an interest in Rev. Martin Luther, where both he and his followers wanted to liken him and his role to that of the European reformer. Thus, Christian views such as that of Ram Mohan Roy's The Precepts of Jesus has had at least an indirect influence on Periyar.|$|E
5|$|Placing {{an integer}} {{superscript}} after the <b>name</b> <b>or</b> {{symbol of a}} function, as if the function were being raised to a power, commonly refers to repeated function composition rather than repeated multiplication. Thus, f 3(x) may mean f(f(f(x))); in particular, f −1(x) usually denotes the inverse function of f. Iterated functions are {{of interest in the}} study of fractals and dynamical systems. Babbage was the first to study the problem of finding a functional square root f 1/2(x).|$|E

5|$|SmarTrip cards {{comply with}} the ISO/IEC 14443 Type B standard. A {{microchip}} contained within the card stores its value, {{as well as the}} rider’s most recent entry and exit points, and a unique identifier. However, the unique identifier is not linked to a person’s <b>name</b> <b>or</b> identity, unless one registers the card online. Registering SmarTrip cards allows riders to recover their remaining balance (minus a $5 replacement fee), should the card be lost, stolen, or damaged. The unique identifier also allows workers enrolled in the SmartBenefits program, which allows employers to subsidize employee transportation costs tax-free, to credit their monthly benefits to their cards.|$|E
5|$|TK is {{a mysterious}} {{character}} {{who wears a}} large bandanna over his eyes and tends to break out in dance every so often. No one knows his real <b>name</b> <b>or</b> past. He speaks in semi-nonsensical English phrases depending on the situation, mainly quoted from pop culture, but apparently does not know English fluently. He saves the team many times and does know some Japanese but rarely speaks it. He carries Browning Hi-Power and LAR Grizzly handguns or a PP-19 Bizon submachine gun during missions.|$|E
5|$|The ISO 3166/MA updates ISO 3166-1 when necessary. A {{country is}} usually {{assigned}} new ISO 3166-1 codes if it changes its <b>name</b> <b>or</b> its territorial boundaries.

Codes for formerly used country names that were deleted from ISO 3166-1 are published in ISO 3166-3.|$|E
