40|$|Environmental and climatic {{variability}} affects {{the distribution and}} recruitment of fish populations. AZTI has studied the relationships between some environmental processes generated by NAO and the recruitment of three tuna stocks: western and eastern bluefin (Thunnus thynnus) and <b>northern</b> <b>albacore</b> (Thunnus alalunga). The first study on these species was presented by Santiago (1997), considering the time period 1969 - 1992; on this study w...|$|E
40|$|Taiwanese distant water {{longline}} fishery {{has operated}} throughout the WCPO since the 1960 s {{with the following}} target species: <b>northern</b> <b>albacore</b> in Regions 1 and 2 of the WCPO, bigeye and yellowfin in Regions 3 and 4, and southern albacore in Regions 5 and 6. Among the regions, fishing operations in Region 6 have the most complete time series of data, with more consistent fishing activity and species targeting than indices available from other distant water fishing nations. It is therefore considered important to obtain standardized CPUE series for this fleet and region, which may then {{be used in the}} stock assessments of WCPO yellowfin and bigeye tunas. This report provides standardized CPUE series for the two species in the region using a delta-lognormal approach. Factors affecting catch rates are investigated using regression tree methods. ...|$|E
25|$|For example, in the Asian <b>northern</b> Pacific, <b>albacore</b> are {{confined}} {{between two}} current systems. The northern boundary {{is determined by}} the cold North Pacific Current and the southern boundary {{is determined by the}} North Equatorial Current. To complicate things, their distribution is further modified within the area defined by the two current systems by another current, the Kuroshio Current, whose flows fluctuate seasonally.|$|R
40|$|Generalized {{linear model}} (GLM) {{was used to}} {{standardize}} the CPUE for <b>northern</b> Atlantic <b>Albacore</b> caught by Taiwanese longline fisheries during 1968 - 2001. Three sub-areas are defined based on the species composition of 12 5 x 5 statistical blocks. The subarea 3, where non-albacore-directed efforts have increased since mid- 1980 s, is not the traditional albacore fishing ground. We find that the standardized CPUE trend indicated that: (1) CPUE appeared to sharply decline {{at the beginning of}} the fisheries (early 1968 to 1971), but it remained rather stable until the mid- 1980 s; (2) CPUE trend appeared to decline since 1988, but rose slightly i...|$|R
40|$|Generalized {{linear model}} (GLM) {{was used to}} {{standardize}} the CPUE for <b>northern</b> Atlantic <b>albacore</b> (Thunnus alalunga) caught by Taiwanese longline fisheries during 1968 - 1998. Three sub-areas, based on nominal CPUEs of the main species caught were defined. Sub-area 3, where non-albacore-directed efforts have increased recently, is not the traditional albacore fishing ground. The CPUE trends, which were derived from including or excluding the data of this sub-area, were estimated and compared. The standardized CPUE trend, estimated from the dataset including Sub-area 3, indicated that: (1) CPUE appeared to decline sharply {{at the beginning of}} the fishery (early 1968 to 1971), but it remained quite stable until the early 1990 s; (2) CPUE trend appeared to decline since 1992. The CPUE series, estimated from the dataset excluding Sub-area 3, showed that: (1) although i...|$|R
40|$|It is {{difficult}} to address all of the direct environmental impacts of fisheries using conventional methods of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). A methodological framework was developed that calculates regionalised characterisation factors for biomass uptake by fishing activities to assess impacts of biotic-resource depletion at both species and ecosystem levels. These two levels were studied to include effects of catch on {{the collapse of a}} particular stock of a given species and on total biomass availability in oceans. Characterisation factors were calculated for 127 fish species and 88 marine provinces. The compatibility of this method with other frameworks is discussed, as well as the methodological limitations. The method was applied to two contrasting examples from fisheries (<b>Northern</b> Atlantic <b>albacore</b> tuna and <b>Northern</b> Argentine anchovy). The impacts of one tonne of tuna on biotic natural resources were 4 and 14 times as high as those of anchovy at the ecosystem and species levels, respectively. The application demonstrates that the method is relevant, as it addresses a topic of global interest and fills a gap in LCA impact assessment to contrast impacts of removals of different fish species in terms of biotic natural resource depletion...|$|R
40|$|Otoliths from 10 <b>northern</b> Atlantic <b>albacore</b> of 40 - 44 cm fork length were {{collected}} and daily ring counts were taken. Four {{out of these}} 10 specimens were concurrently performing its respective 1 st dorsal spine cross-section ring reading. The otolith growth pattern of daily rings {{can be described as}} (1) a clear nuclei piled with constant oval shaped ring increment to about 12 counts, yet unfortunately, this segment was often lost; (2) followed by greater ring increment alongside the oval long axis direction for a period of time; (3) then followed by a sudden shifting of growth direction of about 60 degrees toward the oval short axis, {{in such a way that}} often produced a notch alongside the oval long axis. A In company with such growth pattern, four groups of daily ring gatherings can be identified. The spine cross-section, on the other hand, a symmetric structure alongside the sagital plane was observed. In principle, the ring mark that appeared at each side of the two structures should be identical. Often it is not the case. It is thus postulated that the least, or a common denominator, count of ring mark should be viewed as the most appropriate figure for the specimen. Judged by the totality of a spine cross-section ring mark, all four specimens contain only one ring, which is roughly at 200 - 250 daily ring counts of the same individual. Although evidence that the spine 1 st ring mark corresponds to a growth pattern change in daily rings seems to exist, further confirmative analyses are still needed. RÉSUM...|$|R
40|$|Temperate tunas in the North Pacific {{including}} Pacific {{bluefin tuna}} and the <b>northern</b> stock of <b>albacore</b> tuna {{have been observed}} to experience considerable fluctuations in stock abundance {{over a long period}} of time, whereas the abundance of tropical tunas in the western and central Pacific (i. e. the southern stocks) has consistently decreased during relatively short exploitation histories. In consideration of these characteristics, we examined, theoretically as well as empirically, the applicability of historically-based limit reference points (LRPs) such as Floss to North Pacific stocks and contrasted these with maximum sustainable yield (MSY) -based LRPs such as FMSY proposed for Western and Central Pacific southern stocks. Numerical simulations indicated that historically-based LRPs are appropriate for northern stocks when recruitment compensation is high (i. e. when “steepness ” in the stock recruitment relationship is high). In contrast, MSY-based LRPs often have a high risk of allowing recruitment overfishing of northern stocks when process errors are large. Based on these results, we suggest that LRPs set with reference to historical stock sizes are worthy of consideration for temperate tunas in the North Pacific...|$|R
