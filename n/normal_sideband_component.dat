40|$|Electrical motor stator current signals {{have been}} widely used to monitor the {{condition}} of induction machines and their downstream mechanical equipment. The key technique used for current signal analysis is based on Fourier transform (FT) to extract weak fault <b>sideband</b> <b>components</b> from signals predominated with supply frequency component and its higher order harmonics. However, the FT based method has limitations such as spectral leakage and aliasing, leading to significant errors in estimating the <b>sideband</b> <b>components.</b> Therefore, this paper presents the use of dynamic time warping (DTW) to process the motor current signals for detecting and quantifying common faults in a downstream two-stage reciprocating compressor. DTW is a time domain based method and its algorithm is simple and easy to be embedded into real-time devices. In this study DTW is used to suppress the supply frequency component and highlight the <b>sideband</b> <b>components</b> based on the introduction of a reference signal which has the same frequency component as that of the supply power. Moreover, a sliding window is designed to process the raw signal using DTW frame by frame for effective calculation. Based on the proposed method, the stator current signals measured from the compressor induced with different common faults and under different loads are analysed for fault diagnosis. Results show that DTW based on residual signal analysis through the introduction of a reference signal allows the supply components to be suppressed well so that the fault related <b>sideband</b> <b>components</b> are highlighted for obtaining accurate fault detection and diagnosis results. In particular, the root mean square (RMS) values of the residual signal can indicate the differences between the healthy case and different faults under varying discharge pressures.

This produces a converted series <b>sideband</b> <b>component</b> barrier signal. The residual carrier signal and the converted series <b>sideband</b> <b>component</b> carrier are added together to produce a tracking carrier signal. The tracking carrier signal is multiplied with the output from a voltage controlled oscillator in the tracking loop to obtain an error signal which drives the voltage controlled oscillator and tracks the incoming signal frequency.

So the <b>sideband</b> <b>components</b> can be regarded as fault characteristics, and their frequency detection is key to identify the BRB fault. However, the strongest fault-related components at (1 [*]±[*] 2 s)f 1 Hz are quite close to fundamental component due to small slip value and their amplitudes are relatively small, which make them easy to be submerged by the leakage of fundamental component, reducing the reliability of BRB fault detection. In addition, their signal property differs significantly under various motor-working conditions. When motor runs in steady state, the values of fbrk are almost constant, and when motor is running in transient state, such as start up or load change, the values of fbrk are variable, that is to say, the fault-related components are non-stationary signals. For these two different properties of stator current, scholars have adopted many different signal processing methods.|$|R

The features of Finite Element Method are significant, which consider the physical mapping of stator winding and rotor bar distribution. Therefore, modeling of the faults in stator winding, rotor bars and air-gap eccentricity will be predicated in more accurate way. In comparison with conventional methods such as coupling method, the Finite Element Method considers the complex machine geometry, material type of the bar, current and the flux distributions within the electrical machines. As a result, the air-gap eccentricity and the broken bars can be modeled effectively using this approach. Motor current signature analysis has been used to give a decision about the fault occurrence. For the broken rotor bar, frequency of the <b>sideband</b> <b>components</b> around the fundamental is used to indicate the presence of fault.
