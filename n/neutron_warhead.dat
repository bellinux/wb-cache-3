5000|$|Lithium-6 hydride (Li6H) {{is cited}} as {{being used as}} a {{countermeasure}} to reduce the vulnerability and [...] "harden" [...] nuclear warheads from the effects of externally generated neutrons.Radiation hardening of the warhead's electronic components as a countermeasure to high altitude neutron warheads somewhat reduces the range that a <b>neutron</b> <b>warhead</b> could successfully cause an unrecoverable glitch by the transient radiation effects on electronics (TREE) effects.|$|E
50|$|Pincus has won several {{newspaper}} prizes {{including the}} 1961 Page One award for magazine reporting in The Reporter, the George Polk Award in 1977 for {{stories in the}} Washington Post exposing the <b>neutron</b> <b>warhead,</b> a television Emmy for writing on the 1981 CBS News documentary series, “Defense of the United States”, and in 1999 {{he was awarded the}} first Stewart Alsop Award given by the Association of Foreign Intelligence Officers for his coverage of national security affairs. In 2002 he was one of six Washington Post reporters who won a Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting, and in 2010 the Arthur Ross Media Award from the American Academy for Diplomacy.|$|E
50|$|Although {{no country}} is {{currently}} known to deploy {{them in an}} offensive manner, all thermonuclear dial-a-yield warheads that have about 10 kiloton and lower as one dial option, with a considerable fraction of that yield derived from fusion reactions, can be considered able to be neutron bombs in use, if not in name. The only country definitely known to deploy dedicated (that is, not dial-a-yield) neutron warheads {{for any length of}} time is the Soviet Union/Russia, which inherited the USSR's <b>neutron</b> <b>warhead</b> equipped ABM-3 Gazelle missile program. This ABM system contains at least 68 neutron warheads with a 10 kiloton yield each and it has been in service since 1995, with inert missile testing approximately every other year since then (2014). The system is designed to destroy incoming endoatmospheric level nuclear warheads aimed at Moscow and other targets and is the lower-tier/last umbrella of the A-135 anti-ballistic missile system (NATO reporting name: ABM-3).|$|E
5000|$|Development of ER warheads for Lance continued, but in {{the early}} 1970s {{attention}} had turned to using modified versions of the W70, the W70 Mod 3. Development was subsequently postponed by President Jimmy Carter in 1978 following protests against his administration's plans to deploy <b>neutron</b> <b>warheads</b> to ground forces in Europe. On November 17, 1978, in a test the USSR detonated its first similar-type bomb. [...] President Ronald Reagan restarted production in 1981. The Soviet Union began a propaganda campaign against the US's neutron bomb in 1981 following Reagan's announcement. In 1983 Reagan then announced the Strategic Defense Initiative, which surpassed neutron bomb production in ambition and vision and with that the neutron bomb quickly faded {{from the center of the}} public's attention.Three types of enhanced radiation weapons (ERW) were deployed by the United States. The W66 warhead, for the anti-ICBM Sprint missile system, was deployed in 1975 and retired the next year, along with the missile system. The W70 Mod 3 warhead was developed for the short-range, tactical MGM-52 Lance missile, and the W79 Mod 0 was developed for nuclear artillery shells. The latter two types were retired by President George H. W. Bush in 1992, following the end of the Cold War. The last W70 Mod 3 warhead was dismantled in 1996, and the last W79 Mod 0 was dismantled by 2003, when the dismantling of all W79 variants was completed.|$|R
5000|$|Goldston {{has been}} a long-time {{advocate}} of nuclear disarmament. In 2013, he, Boaz Barak, and Alexander Glaser worked to design a [...] "zero-knowledge" [...] system to verify that warheads designated for disarmament are actually what they purport to be. By directing high-energy <b>neutrons</b> into the <b>warhead</b> under investigation, and comparing the distribution passing through to the distribution that passed through a known warhead, inspectors can determine whether a warhead being disarmed is genuine or a ruse designed to evade treaty requirements, without leaking nuclear secrets. For this work, Foreign Policy magazine named them to their 2014 list of 100 Leading Global Thinkers.|$|R
