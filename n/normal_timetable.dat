40|$|Observations {{of teams}} have been made during 3 years of ongoing {{experiences}} in several local middle school settings. These observations {{have occurred in the}} course of teaching middle school classes as a participant-observer, conducting a single case study of a state P- 12 school that established a middle school program (Main. 2003), and undertaking a major study in progress of four teaching teams in three middle schools. These observations have provided a basis for reflecting on the current practice environment for middle school teaching teams. Using teaching teams in middle schooling has been justified in terms of benefits for teacher collegiality, student learning, and creation of a flexible environment. That is, teaming allows the creation of a larger working space and more adaptable working time, which then enables teachers to incorporate virtually any teaching or learning method with any combination of students {{at any time during the}} <b>normal</b> <b>timetabled</b> sessions of a school day. However, this flexibility raises questions not only about 'what', 'how', and 'when' to team-teach but also about how teachers manage the process of forming and developing as a team.

50|$|As well as {{a strong}} {{sporting}} tradition, the school had a Combined Cadet Force (CCF) contingent, which started in October 1914 {{just a few months}} after the start of the First World War with an Army section, although, the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy sections were not founded until a few years after the end of the Second World War in 1949 and 1950, respectively. Until 2006, the CCF had been incorporated as part of the <b>normal</b> school <b>timetable,</b> initially compulsory for pupils of the fourth form to the lower sixth (now Years 10-12) then voluntary, but it then became an entirely voluntary after-school activity, although it did allow pupils in the third form (now Year 9) to join the Corps for the first time. However, according to the Summer 2015 edition of In Focus magazine which contained a potted history of the CCF, declining numbers of cadets resulted in the disbandment of the CCF at the end of the summer term in 2015, ending 101 years of military-related tradition at the school. The CCF was then replaced by a variety of adventurous activities for the pupils. It also has a student council, created in 2003, which seeks to improve the lives of Birkenhead School pupils.|$|R
40|$|Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} used, {{particularly in the}} developing world, to provide low-cost, high-capacity urban mobility. An example of this trend is Bogotá’s TransMilenio BRT system, the test site for this thesis, which uses an homogeneous fleet of 18 metre long articulated buses to service 1, 450, 000 passenger trips per day, and which reaches a peak passenger load level of 45, 000 passengers per hour per direction. The computational tools and techniques used to plan the timetables of such BRT systems are largely {{the same set of}} tools and techniques used to plan non-BRT transit systems. Unlike other transit systems, high-load BRT systems commonly run simultaneous express services, a situation that the tools developed to timetable non-BRT transit systems were not specifically designed for. Due to the running of simultaneous express services, the timetabling of highload BRT systems becomes a combinatorial problem, a far more complex class of problem than <b>normal</b> non-combinatorial <b>timetabling.</b> The thesis is advanced here that high-load BRT systems could be timetabled far more efficiently via a software tool built around a recognition of the problem’s combinatorial nature. This thesis is tested by building such a software tool, using that tool to develop an alternative timetable for the Américas Line of the TransMilenio BRT system, and then comparing that timetable’s performance to the performance of the existing timetable. Data used for the Américas Line was from the period Monday the 23 rd to Friday the 27 th of May 2005. The software tool developed to process this data changes express service stopping patterns as quickly as passenger load changes, leading to a great many express patterns {{over the course of a}} one day timetable. Due to this rapid tracking of passenger load, the resulting timetable is referred to as an “ultra-efficient timetable. ”The ultra-efficient timetable produced for the Américas Line has 88 unique stopping patterns, compared to the existing timetable’s three, and is shown to be tracking passenger load far more precisely. Bus fleet size under the ultra-efficient timetable is 9 % lower than for the existing timetable, indicating an estimated capital cost saving for the Américas Line of US$ 1. 8 million. Bus kilometres travelled under the ultra-efficient timetable are 40 % lower than for the existing timetable, indicating an estimated annual operating cost saving for the Américas Line of US$ 6 million. The ultra-efficient timetable delivering these performance improvements is shown to be approximately ten times more complex than could be reasonably deployed using paper timetables. Consequently, an ultra-efficient timetable would need to be deployed in conjunction with a fully-automated passenger information system. With this caveat, the thesis that high-load BRT systems can be far more efficiently timetabled using a combinatorial software tool is confirmed here. As an alternative to deploying ultra-efficient timetables, the combinatorial timetabling technology developed for this thesis could also be used to produce more efficient versions of <b>normal</b> paper-based BRT <b>timetables...</b>|$|R

40|$|Formal {{education}} {{is the key to}} individual and national development. Kenya introduced adult literacy education soon after independence because majority of the Africans, who were the majority in the country and in whose hands the country was now placed, were illiterate due to colonial racial discrimination. Fifty years down the line, 38. 5 % adult Kenyans are illiterate. This paper seeks to highlight the reason for this, despite the country’s commitment at international level where she is a signatory to various charters and conventions on “Education for All (EFA) ” and at home where she has made various policies towards minimizing and even eradicating illiteracy. It is opinioned that the management of Adult Literacy Education by the Ministry of Gender and Social Services has denied her the advantages of higher financial allocations and expert management enjoyed by other educational sectors in the country. It is recommended that the management of ALE is shifted to the Ministry of Education and the teaching and learning be done within the primary and secondary school premises by regular school teachers outside the <b>normal</b> school teaching <b>timetable.</b> It is further recommended that stakeholders brainstorm and carry out empirical studies to ascertain the practicability of this suggestion...|$|R
40|$|The European Train Control System (ETCS) {{as part of}} the ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System) is a {{train control}} and {{automation}} system, which has been introduced into the UK rail network. The major change with the introduction of the ERTMS has been the shift of the movement authority from signals outside on the tracks to inside the cab, and the introduction of speed profiles that the drivers must adhere to. The introduction of this new system triggered the need to understand its impact on the train driving task and train driver behaviour. In particular, the effect the ERTMS has on drivers’ cognitive strategies and demands. The overall aim of the thesis was to understand the effects of new train control and automation technology on train drivers’ behaviours. The research was conducted, using a mixed methods approach, in the rail environment with train drivers and rail experts. Literature reviews of existing train driving models, train driving research and associated issues of increasing control and automation on human behaviour; were used to provide the theoretical context for the thesis. The literature review highlighted that there was a potential shift in cognitive strategies and demands with the introduction of train automation and control technology. Due to the limited amount of research in train driving on the whole, but also train driving with automation and control technology, the majority of the literature hypothesised the possible impact of the introduction of automation and control technology. An exploratory study of some of the different forms of train driving in the UK, was used to generate insight about train driving with different forms of train technologies and provided the theoretical foundations for the following studies. The emerging cognitive themes also addressed the gap in knowledge about train driving with different forms of technologies. The emerging cognitive themes from this study included route knowledge and memory, monitoring, allocation of attention, anticipation, prioritisation and decision making. A semi-structured interview study with ERTMS drivers, addressed some of the questions raised in the previous study using ERTMS drivers’ subjective experiences. Since the exploratory study, the results demonstrated an adaptation and shift towards acceptance of the system and it also identified some of the driving strategies that had emerged. This chapter investigated drivers’ subjective experience, highlighting high-level strategy changes. A real world exploratory eye-tracking study with both conventional and ERTMS drivers on their <b>normal</b> <b>timetabled</b> routes, provided a wealth of data. The first level of the quantitative eye-tracking analysis, aimed to address the industry question of ‘heads up’ vs. ‘heads up, heads down driving’. It demonstrated a shift of typical visual attentional strategy from monitoring outside on the tracks to speed information inside the cab. Analysis of verbal protocol data collected in the eye-tracking study also provided some rich qualitative data about train driver strategies and demands. Further analyses of the eye-tracking data, identified events where there is a difference in visual behaviour between ERTMS driving and conventional driving, but also between each type of driving and its own baseline data. An expert elicitation workshop with ERTMS human factors experts, was used to generate requirements for a future train driving model. The main findings highlighted that several models are needed to help address some of the issues raised, as they could provide different uses, acting as ‘building blocks’ to the overall picture. Qualitative models can be used to provide the framework and language as a communication tool, whilst more quantitative models can be used to compute error and workload. Models need to be informed by cognitive theory but also focus on the train driving tasks and information used by train drivers. Finally, the studies presented in this thesis were used to develop an integrated human factors model of the influence of train automation and control technology on train driving and guidance was generated for future train driving models for both conventional and ERTMS train driving. The current research has contributed critical knowledge to both the academic literature but also informed human factors practitioners in the rail industry. The thesis has contributed novel understanding about train driving with a control and automation technology, which have already been utilised by the rail industry...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{development}} of skills which are not strictly associated with technical abilities or specific subject contents has become a central focus {{of education and the}} debate on how to define and promote what is usually indicated as "core" skills or "key" competencies is involving national educational Institutions and systems, especially in OECD countries. Among such skills a crucial role is assigned to strategic and reasoning abilities. While a general agreement on the importance of such skills is widely acknowledged, it is more difficult to find indications on how to develop them, especially with young children. As a matter of fact, they are not well defined, there are not consolidated methodologies to improve them, and it is also quite difficult to evaluate results and achievements. For these reasons we considered interesting and fruitful to reflect on how ICT, and, in particular, some kind of computer games, could be used to analyse and promote such abilities. The paper reports on a small-scale, long-term pilot project aimed at fostering the development of strategic and reasoning abilities in young primary school pupils by engaging them in playing with a number of computer games. Such games have been selected within a variety of products available on the market and on the web (free or shareware). The pilot has been carried out for two years with two classes of primary school (age from 8 to 10) and is currently in under development for the third year. Pupils of each class, divided in groups, have attended a computer session of an hour per week within the <b>normal</b> school <b>timetable,</b> under the direct supervision of the class teacher and of some researchers. Qualitative data have been collected by means of observation protocols and evaluation forms in order to analyse the extent of the progresses made by the pupils during the pilot and to identify specific evidenced problems and drawbacks. The research study has two main related goals. The first goal is to outline a classification of the considered computer games {{on the basis of the}} specific abilities they foster and of the kind of mediation they offer to their acquisition. The ultimate goal is to understand how pupils organise their reasoning and plan their strategies in playing with a number of games in order to delineate some common pattern and to outline possible difficulties in the performed processes. The extent and duration of the study mean that, whilst the findings are not generalizable, they do offer insights into some mechanism underpinning basic strategic and reasoning skills, and into some of the characteristics and potentialities of existing computer games that might be used productively in schools...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the use of diagnostic questions as formative assessment probes in science teaching. Formative assessment practice is still not well developed in most schools. Much practice depends on the formative use of summative tests. In addition, the National Curriculum level descriptors provide an imprecise notion of progression through many science concepts. The study sought to use more research-based materials to improve the author’s formative assessment practice by carrying out an evaluation of a single action research cycle. A backward design approach was used to generate a series of 31 diagnostic questions which could assess understanding in a KS 3 solution chemistry topic in a teaching sequence building on progressively more demanding concepts. The materials were used in the author’s school with Year 8 students (n= 60). In a 3 - 4 week teaching programme. The project provides evidence that the diagnostic questions developed are a highly effective means of gathering rich data of student understanding in a fashion which allows the reshaping of teaching during a <b>normal</b> <b>timetable.</b> The probes were sufficiently sensitive to detect misconceptions in chemistry and provided the teacher with a secure basis for deciding when to repeat the teaching or extend the concepts being taught. The progression in the teaching sequence was analysed using the frameworks of Bloom and Piaget. Students’ performance was shown to be linked to the level of conceptual demand. Evidence was presented which suggested that diagnostic questions could be used as formative assessment probes with summative potential. ...|$|E

The primary {{aim of this study}} was to assess the quantity and quality of physical activity during Motive 8 PE lessons compared to PE lessons taught by the school PE specialist. A secondary aim was to assess whether PE lessons impact on daily activity levels. Physical activity was measured for 2 weeks in 19 children, aged 10 – 11 years, using accelerom-etry. In week 1, half of the children undertook a normal week of lessons, including two School PE lessons (football-based and dance-based); the other half also followed their <b>normal</b> <b>timetable,</b> except that Motive 8 led their PE lessons. In week 2, this was reversed. Motive 8 classes provided 20. 5 ± 3. 8 minutes of moderate and 7. 9 ± 2. 6 minutes of vigorous activity. This was greater than the 15. 9 ± 6. 1 minutes of moderate and 5. 1 ± 3. 8 minutes of vigorous activity experienced in the School PE lessons (p < 0. 005). Seventy-five percent of children achieved 22 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity in Motive 8 PE lessons, compared with the 9 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity achieved by 75 % of children in School PE classes.
