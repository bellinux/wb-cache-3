40|$|Abstract. The taxonomic {{composition}} and geographic distribution of Euphausiacea and Decapoda {{occurring in the}} neuston were examined in spring, summer and autumn surveys of a 2. 4 x 104 km 2 area of the Bay of Fundy. Adult Meganyctiphanes norvegica and Thysanoessa tnermis (Euphausi-acea) were present in every survey and were most abundant in autumn. Larval euphausiids were most abundant in summer but were also present in spring and autumn. Adults of three <b>natantian</b> <b>decapod</b> species were rarely collected; however, larval Natantia were common in summer and autumn. Larvae representing seven genera of reptantian decapods were collected in summer and autumn; the most abundant was Cancer sp., which was numerically dominant in summer samples. Distributional patterns divide the taxa into inner and outer bay components at a line drawn betwee...|$|E
40|$|The bait-attending fauna of the abyssal–hadal {{transition}} {{zone of the}} Kermadec Trench, SW Pacific Ocean (4329 – 7966 m), was investigated using a baited camera and a trap lander. The abyssal stations (4329 – 6007 m) revealed a typical scavenging fish community comprising macrourids and synaphobranchid eels, as well as <b>natantian</b> <b>decapods.</b> At the hadal depths of 7199 and 7561 m, the endemic liparid Notoliparis kermadecensis was observed aggregating at the bait reaching surprisingly high numbers of 5 and 13, respectively. A total of 3183 invertebrate samples were collected (mean deployment time= 16 h) of which 97. 8 % were of the order Amphipoda (nine families, 16 species). Ten of the amphipod species represent new distributional records for the Kermadec Trench and the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone; this includes the shallowest known record of the endemic hadal amphipod Hirondellea dubia (6000, 6007 m). Using amphipods to statistically examine the compositional change across the abyssal–hadal boundary, an ecotone between depths 6890 m was found, indicating {{that there is an}} ecologically distinct bait-attending fauna in this trench...|$|R
40|$|Data on the diet, feeding {{habits and}} daily rations of Hoplostethus mediterraneus Cuvier, 1829 in the bathyal eastern Ionian Sea (Mediterranean Sea) are presented. A total of 430 {{specimens}} collected by bottom trawls at depths ranging from 473 to 603 m during four 24 -h day–night sampling cycles covering the four annual seasons was examined. H. mediterraneus diet consisted of pelagic and vagile epibenthic prey, mainly crustaceans, and {{was dominated by}} benthopelagic <b>natantian</b> <b>decapods</b> (83. 35 % IRI, index of relative importance). Seasonal changes in diet were apparent and related to seasonal fluctuations in suprabenthic and zooplanktonic prey in the environment. Diel patterns in stomach fullness and trends in diel feeding cycles are discussed {{in relation to the}} vertical migratory movements of available prey (i. e. suprabenthos and zooplankton). Daily-ration estimates were determined by evacuation-rate models and ranged from 0. 143 % to 0. 397 % WW/WW. Overall, daily-ration estimates were within the range of the daily consumption of other deep-sea fish. Deduced from diet contents, we found a constant gross energy intake (305 – 316 kcal g– 1) during all seasons. As a possible response to the reproductive peak of mature females observed in summer, H. mediterraneus increases its food consumption, which, in turn, is coupled with an increase in food availability...|$|R
