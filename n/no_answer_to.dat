Therefore, Dōgen left to seek an answer from other Buddhist masters. He went to visit Kōin, the Tendai abbot of Onjō-ji Temple (園城寺), asking him this same question. Kōin said that, in order to find an answer, he might want to consider studying Chán in China. In 1217, two years after the death of contemporary Zen Buddhist Myōan Eisai, Dōgen went to study at Kennin-ji Temple (建仁寺), under Eisai's successor, Myōzen (明全).|$|E

The next day, while shopping for tuxedos, Sydney asks Peter why he is marrying Zooey, and also asks for an $8,000 loan. After some thought, Peter decides to lend Sydney the money, and later grants him the honor of being best man at his wedding. Zooey, meanwhile, has become suspicious of Sydney. Peter tells Zooey that he lent Sydney money and asks her if she knows why they are getting married, since he had <b>no</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> Sydney's question. Hurt and angry, Zooey leaves.|$|E

25|$|The duo's later {{campaigns against}} Arakan (1545–1547) and Siam (1547–1549) however fell short. In both campaigns, Toungoo forces won all major open battles, {{and went on}} to lay siege to the capitals, Mrauk-U and Ayutthaya respectively. But they still had <b>no</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> heavily {{fortified}} defenses equipped with Portuguese firearms, and had to retreat both times. Toungoo's own Portuguese supplied cannon had little impact on the walls of both capitals. Nor did they have enough manpower (19,000 and 12,000 troops respectively in Arakanese and Siamese campaigns) for long-term sieges. Nonetheless, despite the setbacks, Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung by 1549 had built up the largest polity in Burma since the fall of Pagan Empire in 1287, stretching from Pagan in the north to Tavoy in the south.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps naturally, Lever {{felt that}} {{the failure of the}} Soap Combine was the result of {{animosity}} and resentment directed at him personally, rather than as a consequence of its members’ dishonesty. Having sought several opinions on the authority of his suit, he retained Sir Edward Carson and two juniors, one of whom was Frederick Edwin Smith, later Lord Birkenhead. For the defendants, Rufus Isaacs, later Marquess of Reading and Viceroy of India, assisted by another K.C. and two juniors, acted for Associated Newspapers Ltd. Lever’s legal team were in no doubt of the outcome; as F.E. Smith reportedly observed 'There is <b>no</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> this action for libel and the damages must be enormous.' On 15 July 1907 the case came up at Liverpool before Mr Justice Lawrence.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial began}} on 21 April 1924. It lasted about two weeks. Near {{the end of}} the trial, Overturf testified in his own defense. He denied the charges, but {{admitted}} that several appraisals were higher than they should have been due to inaccurate measurements of the properties. In addition, Overturf testified that he had asked the veterans’ aid commission several times for instructions on how to prepare his appraisal, but had received <b>no</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> his queries. The jury deliberated for twelve hours before finding Overturf and other defendants guilty of mail fraud. However, after the verdict the jury petitioned the judge for leniency in sentencing, recommending that Overturf and the others be given fines rather than prison sentences. The judge agreed, giving Overturf a $1,000 fine and the others three defendants $500 fines. Overturf paid his fine and did not appeal the outcome of the trial.|$|E

25|$|Bereft of its Australian players Tasmania {{suffered}} in the state match against the tourists, but still 12,000 {{came to see the}} game at Launceston. Hutton, who was lucky with the toss in Australia, won again, chose this time to bat and made 61, but the star of the day was the stylish Tom Graveney with 134. They added 127 for the second wicket, then Graveney put on 105 with Denis Compton (50) for the third. There was a small collapse from 243/2 to 281/6, but Vic Wilson (cricketer) (62 not out) and Johnny Wardle entertained with 111 for the sixth wicket and Hutton declared at 427/7 on the second morning, Noel Diprose the best of the bowlers with 4/107. The Tasmanians had <b>no</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> the in-swing and off-cutters of Peter Loader who took 6/22 off 12 eight-ball overs and were out for 117, captain Emerson Rodwell had to retire hurt on 2, but returned to be bowled by Loader for 11. Hutton, 310 runs ahead elected to bat again, perhaps to entertain the Saturday crowd the next day and sent in nightwatchmen Frank Tyson to open with Reg Simpson. Simpson failed again, ending his chances of playing in the Tests and Bob Appleyard joined Tyson. The MCC scratched round the next day for 133/6 declared, Tyson's 27 was the top score and Terence Cowley took 4/53. Tasmania had no chance of making 444 runs to win and Hutton took the chance to exercise his bowlers. Mike Hyland (49) and added 60 with John Maddox (62 not out), who made his highest First Class score, but was left standing as the rest fell away and Tasmania were out for 200 for a 243 run win.|$|E

500|$|Sarah's last {{attempt to}} re-establish her {{friendship}} with Anne came in 1710, {{when they had}} their final meeting. An account written by Sarah shortly afterwards shows that she pleaded to be given an explanation of why their friendship was at an end, but Anne was unmoved, coldly repeating a few set phrases such as [...] "I shall make <b>no</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> anything you say" [...] and [...] "you may put it in writing". Sarah was so appalled by the Queen's [...] "inhuman" [...] conduct that she was reduced to tears, and, most unusually {{for a woman who}} rarely spoke of religion, ended by threatening the Queen with the judgement of God. Anne replied that God's judgement on her concerned herself only, but later admitted that this was the one remark from Sarah at this interview [...] which had deeply hurt her.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the text}} is ambiguous, making it {{questionable}} that Henry ever matures. As critic Donald Gibson stated in The Red Badge of Courage: Redefining the Hero, [...] "the novel undercuts itself. It says there is <b>no</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> the questions it raises; yet it says the opposite.... It says that Henry Fleming finally sees things as they are; it says he is a deluded fool. It says that Henry does not see things as they are; {{but no one else}} does either." [...] Although Crane critic and biographer Stallman wrote of Henry's [...] "spiritual change" [...] {{by the end of the}} story, he also found this theme difficult to champion in light of the novel's enigmatic ending. Although Henry [...] "progresses upwards toward manhood and moral triumph", as he begins to mature by taking leave of his previous [...] "romantic notions," [...] "the education of the hero ends as it began: in self deception." [...] Critic William B. Dillingham also noted the novel's heroism paradox, especially in terms of the introspective Henry's lapse into unreasoning self-abandon in the second half of the book. Dillingham stated that [...] "in order to be courageous, a man in time of physical strife must abandon the highest of his human facilities, reason and imagination, and act instinctively, even animalistically." ...|$|E

500|$|McKay got {{his fellow}} Democrat, New Hampshire Senator Charles Atherton, to {{introduce}} the bill to authorize the gold dollar and the double eagle in the Senate on February 1, 1849—Atherton {{was chairman of the}} Senate Finance Committee. [...] McKay introduced a version into the House on February 20; debate began the same day. The dollar was attacked by congressmen from the Whig Party, then in the minority, {{on the grounds that it}} would be too small, would be counterfeited and in bad light might be mistakenly spent as a half dime, the coins being similar in size. [...] McKay did not respond substantively, but stated that if no one wanted these denominations, they would not be called for at the Mint, and would not be coined. Pennsylvania Representative Joseph Ingersoll, a Whig, spoke against the bill, noting that Patterson opposed the new denominations, and that the idea had been repeatedly turned down, whenever considered. Another Whig, Massachusetts's Charles Hudson, related that Patterson had sent a real and a counterfeit gold dollar to his committee and the majority of members had been unable to tell the difference. McKay made <b>no</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> these claims, but others did, including New York Congressman Henry Nicoll, who assured the House that the counterfeiting allegations were greatly exaggerated. [...] The point was, he indicated, that the double eagle and gold dollar were wanted by the public, and, in the case of the gold dollar could help money circulate in small communities where banknotes were not accepted. Connecticut Representative John A. Rockwell, a Whig, tried to table the bill, but his motion was defeated. [...] The bill passed easily, and met only minimal opposition in the Senate, becoming law on March 3, 1849.|$|E
500|$|An {{early morning}} {{kick-off}} away to fierce rivals Liverpool {{ended in a}} routine victory for United. Losing to Juventus in the last match of the Champions League before hiatus had {{seemed to have no}} effect on United's domestic dominance. They comprehensively defeated Aston Villa thanks to a solitary Giggs goal and followed it up with a heroic Schmeichel performance to deny Newcastle United at St James' Park. British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a lifelong fan of the Geordies, was among the crowd and was in awe over Ferguson's team, believing that the manager had assembled [...] "one of the greatest sides of the century". Two out of two became three as Everton found <b>no</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> deny the league leaders, who extended their lead {{at the top of the}} table to six points on Boxing Day. The win marked the end of Karel Poborský's spell, coming on for David Beckham in the second half ahead of a switch to Graeme Souness' Benfica. However, what was to come at the end of December exemplified the vulnerability of the defence during the second half of the season. In losing to mid-table Coventry City two days after the Everton win, United blew the chance to open up a nine-point lead at the top of the table, which would virtually slam the door shut on the challengers. They again found themselves a goal down, this time courtesy of Noel Whelan, Solskjær and Sheringham responded to restore the advantage back on the champions but a Dion Dublin penalty and mazy run from youngster Darren Huckerby in the last minute ensured an implausible victory, given the fact that Coventry were 2–1 down with five minutes to go. Prior to the game, Ferguson highlighted the fact that the league [...] "wasn't won in December", but following the defeat blasted his side's display as [...] "silly" [...] and [...] "on the verge of complacency".|$|E
