These samplers were stitched using a variety of needlework styles, threads, and ornament.|$|E

5|$|A {{decompression}} trapeze is {{a device}} used in recreational diving and technical diving to make decompression stops {{more comfortable and}} more secure and provide the divers' surface cover with a visual reference for the divers' position. It consists of a horizontal bar or bars suspended at the depth of intended decompression stops by buoys. The bars are of sufficient weight and the buoys of sufficient buoyancy that the trapeze will <b>not</b> <b>easily</b> change depth in turbulent water or if the divers experience buoyancy control problems.|$|E
5|$|Above the chromosphere, {{in a thin}} (about 200km) {{transition}} region, {{the temperature}} rises rapidly from around 20,000 K in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K. The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma. The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. Rather, it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion. The transition region is <b>not</b> <b>easily</b> visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum can be {{separated}} from the morphologically similar individuals of A.aleuticum by the greater length of the stalks on the medial ultimate segments and of the false indusia, measuring greater than 0.9mm and greater than 3.5mm, respectively, in A.viridimontanum. Spore size is also a useful character (although <b>not</b> <b>easily</b> measured in the field); the average A.viridimontanum spore measures 51.4μm in diameter. While A.aleuticum spores can reach up to 53μm, they average about 43μm. In A.aleuticum growing as a disjunct on eastern serpentine (the specimens most likely to be confused with A.viridimontanum), the rhizome is much more frequently branched, with intervals of 1.0 to 2.0mm between nodes.|$|E

5|$|Amid rising {{concerns}} over {{the threat of a}} French invasion, Sir Thomas Page surveyed the blockhouse in 1778 and concluded that its guns were too closely packed together and that they could <b>not</b> <b>easily</b> fire down-river, proposing that a larger fort be built along the Thames to the east to rectify this problem. New Tavern Fort was constructed shortly afterwards and the eastern Gravesend Blockhouse gun platform was redesigned and extended as part of the work. Two volunteer militia companies were established in 1794 and 1797 to support the blockhouse and in 1805 it was equipped with 19 32 lb guns.|$|E

He is also known for his leadership of the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory, and served as Chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis from 1945 to 1953.|$|E
