40|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (AI) {{programming}} has a {{wide variety}} of aspects of which only the decision system is usually focused on. This paper puts the decision system into perspective {{with the rest of the}} <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> system and then proceeds to categorize different types of <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> by function or efficacy rather than method of implementation. The focus of this paper is on games programming <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> where two types of <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> are defined followed by placing the entire <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> system into perspective. Then a taxonomy model is presented upon which <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> can be categorized. This taxonomy model also forms a foundation upon which <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> should be implemented in the development of a game and upon which all previous, present and future <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> can be gauged. 1...|$|R

40|$|Distribution and {{parallelism}} {{are two of}} {{the major}} topics which are central to current <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> research. In distributed <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence,</b> these fundamental aspects are closely related to the problem of co-operation.

The paper describes the system architecture and confirms the choice of cooperating strategy in this kind of application. INTRODUCTION Distribution and parallelism have historically been important themes in <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (AI). Hayes-Roth [1] argues that "all real systems are distributed". The conceptual basis for concurrent problem solving underlying <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> has been heavily discussed. Nilsson [2] claims that distributed problem solving is very important in our understanding of <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence.</b> Distributed problem solving is also motivated from a cognitive science point of view [3].

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with copyright regulation of works created by <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> systems. The rapid advances in <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> are calling into question some of the fundamental assumptions upon which intellectual property law rests. Currently, the European framework of copyright law does not take non-human innovation into account. Meanwhile, advances in <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> are quickly making machine-generation of creative works a reality. Institutions of the European Union have recently explicitly addressed the need to clarify legal implications of advancements in <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence.</b> In this regard, two research questions have been analysed in the thesis: First, whether works co-created or independently created by <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> systems are eligible for copyright protection under current EU copyright law. Second, to whom, if anyone, should the rights to works entirely generated by <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> systems be allocated...|$|R
