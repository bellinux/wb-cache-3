40|$|Kriyakala, {{also known}} as Shatkriyakala, is {{predominantly}} a concept of Ayurveda which describes different phases of disease formation in its own unique way. This concept can be comparable with <b>natural</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> in modern medicine. Though many authorities compare it simply with pathogenesis but a meticulous look will reveal its relation with <b>natural</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease.</b> A good understanding of <b>natural</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> helps to frame public health intervention strategies, more specially the disease prevention stratagem. Similarly a scrupulous insight about Kriyakala will also help us to frame public health intervention strategy. Both modern medicine and public health describes three different types of prevention measures such as primary prevention, secondary prevention and tertiary prevention which can appropriately be applied to different stages of <b>natural</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> with their modes of intervention.

Objective: To assess the values of 10 first-line therapies for RRMS, including generic glatiramer acetate, versus the <b>natural</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> for a newly diagnosed RRMS patient. Perspective: United States third-party payer. Methods: A Markov model was developed and estimates were made using data on <b>natural</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> progression, annual relapse rates, medication efficacy, costs, and utilities to determine incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results: Base case is a cohort of 30 -year-old females at Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS) state 0 at a 20 year time horizon versus the <b>natural</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease.</b> Dimethyl fumarate demonstrates the lowest ICER at $ 895, 073 /QALY.

Children infected with high-risk HPV subtypes remain a vulnerable patient population, and there is minimal literature on the <b>natural</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> and effects of overtreatment. Based on a literature review, conservative management, HPV vaccination, and consideration of the cervical cancer screening guidelines for adolescent females are an appropriate treatment course until more studies are reported on cervical cancer screening in survivors of child sexual abuse...|$|E

40|$|The Markov {{process is}} {{a useful tool for}} {{modeling}} the <b>natural</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease,</b> which is becoming increasingly important as new diagnostic tests increase the detectability of early-stage disease. The accuracy of a Markov model, however, depends on the accuracy of the estimates for the transition probabilities between different stages of disease. Because these estimates are usually based on "expert opinion " or small cohort studies, they are subject to imprecision and bias. The authors describe an alternative method of estimating transition probabilities from the stage distribution of disease observed at the time of death and age-specific mortality rates from other causes. In addition, they prove that the transition probabilities are unique given certain assumptions about how they change with age. Finally, they illustrate the method using population-based data for prostate cancer.
