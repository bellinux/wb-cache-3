In {{an interview with}} Country Stars Central, Smith {{said that she was}} ill with the stomach flu while recording the album, but, [...] still enjoyed making the record, Produced by country and bluegrass artist Ricky Skaggs (White's husband), the album received a nomination from the Dove Awards. The website Slipcue.com reviewed the release and commented that Love <b>Never</b> <b>Fails,</b> [...] "is probably too rowdy for most Southern Gospel fans (who really like tinkly pianos and less-twangy vocals), and while it probably won't wow many country listeners, for folks who are fans any of these three singers, {{this is kind of a}} treat.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers criticised Toadstool Tours use of camera, {{especially}} when the ball's presented route would ignore obstacles. GameSpot otherwise welcomed the game's visuals, however, arguing that the recurring Mario characters [...] "never looked better".

B.

In a three-and-a-half star review, Slant Magazines Matthew Cole said {{the second half of}} songs was [...] "less stimulating" [...] on an album that [...] "blends slick, radio-friendly R with Prince-aping theatrics, both refracted around a sense of humor that, surreal and sexually unsubtle, would have to make [...] proud". Cole also compared Miguel to singer Kelis, [...] "whose work has an undeniably commercial cunning to it, but who <b>never</b> <b>fails</b> to imbue her pop confections with real personality".|$|E

500|$|In an {{otherwise}} positive review, Allan Hunter of Screendaily.com felt the film lacked [...] "nuanced characters or subtle dialogue", {{but said that}} nonetheless, the film was [...] "involving enough to forgive any infelicities". He also praised the acting and subject matter, prompting him to regard it as [...] "essential viewing on its home territory". Derek Elley of Film Business Asia found the film engrossing but unnecessarily complicated at times, writing, [...] "What keeps the viewer hooked are the performances." [...] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club gave the film a B minus grade, complimenting it as [...] "a scuzzy Filipino crime flick" [...] that was weakened by [...] "humdrum and occasionally heavy-handed police procedural". Andrew Schenker of Slant Magazine scored the film 2.5/4, saying, [...] "Even as the plot takes on increasingly convoluted turns, the movie <b>never</b> <b>fails</b> to keep insisting upon the rottenness of every facet of Filipino society ... is far more successful when plunging us into one of its thrilling action set pieces." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1860s and 1870s ever larger {{forces were}} assembled. Bernard Shaw, {{in his role}} as a music critic, commented, [...] "The stale wonderment which the great chorus <b>never</b> <b>fails</b> to elicit has already been exhausted"; he later wrote, [...] "Why, instead of wasting huge sums on the multitudinous {{dullness}} of a Handel Festival does not somebody set up a thoroughly rehearsed and exhaustively studied performance of the Messiah in St James's Hall with a chorus of twenty capable artists? Most of us would be glad to hear the work seriously performed once before we die." [...] The employment of huge forces necessitated considerable augmentation of the orchestral parts. Many admirers of Handel believed that the composer would have made such additions, had [...] the appropriate instruments been available in his day. Shaw argued, largely unheeded, that [...] "the composer may be spared from his friends, and the function of writing or selecting 'additional orchestral accompaniments' exercised with due discretion." ...|$|E

Douglas' version peaked at number 94 on the UK Singles Chart. Talking to Digital Spy, Douglas said: [...] "It's very hard to sing. I was scared {{to do it because}} it's a big chart song and I'm quite old school. For me, the song is about strength and the music video is based around domestic violence and how a woman gets out of it. The lyrics are so powerful for that interpretation. Hopefully if someone is in that situation and watches it, they'll think, I can get out." [...] A music video to accompany the release of [...] "Titanium" [...] was first released onto YouTube on June 12, 2013 at a total length of three minutes and fifty-four seconds. The music video shows Douglas next to a piano, while a story of domestic abuse plays out.|$|E

[...] She believed that its simplicity turned out to be [...] "impactful, touching and uniting". Garon Cockrell from The Pratt Tribune gave the video a positive review, calling it [...] "excellent". John Walker from MTV felt that throughout the fans' personal struggles [...] "music has helped these individuals persevere and continue to enjoy life. Likewise, Thirty Seconds to Mars seem so moved by the audience's emotions every time they perform live, 'Do or Die's concept seems to be that they want to return the favor." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Halo" [...] {{has been}} covered by other musicians, {{including}} Ailee, ceo (Eric Berglund) and Harper Blynn. Marc Hogan of Pitchfork Media {{has written that}} no cover has been [...] "quite as inspired or as perversely logical" [...] as the one by ceo. Built essentially on bumpy beats, this version makes use of an acoustic guitar, 1980s-era stylized electric guitar, strings, and horns, and ends with a rapped outro. A dancehall cover of [...] "Halo" [...] by Major Lazer, with lead vocals by Elephant Man, was posted on the former's Twitter account the night after Beyoncé won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 2011 Grammy Awards. Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly commented that their version [...] "stays fairly close to the original, except with Elephant Man growling instead of Beyoncé belting the verses". In 2012, Swedish singer Robin Stjernberg, member of the boy band What's Up!, covered the song and included it on his solo debut album My Versions. In 2013, [...] "Halo" [...] was covered by the Icelandic band Hjaltalín, with their version of [...] "Halo" [...] appearing as the B-side of their single [...] "Crack in a Stone".

[...] Daily Mail Marcus Barnes noted that Beyoncé [...] "dazzles", [...] "looked fab", and [...] "sparkled", later agreeing with Jay-Z's affirmation that Beyoncé is the [...] "second coming of Michael Jackson".

[...] He continued to praise her for [...] "raising the bar for live entertainment with a flawless display", further writing, [...] "The worldly pop icon's ability to bring new depth and texture to quality material is almost as impressive as her uncanny knack for connecting with the audience on an emotional level".

[...] Bevan later said that Sharma has [...] "shaken up the residents of Walford as the wise-cracking, wheeler-dealing AJ Ahmed", adding, [...] "He's the gregarious, trouble-magnet who's brought some much needed sunshine to the sombre, squabble-filled soapiness of Albert Square."

2500|$|Mariette Leslie Cotton (1866-1947) was {{a celebrated}} American artist who usually gave her name as Mrs. Leslie Cotton. [...] A student of William Merritt Chase, Carolus-Duran, and Jean-Jacques Henner , she worked mainly in Paris but also {{maintained}} studios in London and New York. [...] By birth and marriage she possessed {{a level of}} wealth and social prestige that, together with her artistic skill, enabled her to obtain lucrative commissions from prominent individuals. The portraits she painted were praised for their veracity, style, and fine technique. Their subjects included kings, aristocrats, celebrities, and members of wealthy families. Late in her career a critic wrote that her [...] "popularity has a sound basis, for her portraits combine such abstract artistic qualities as effective and infinitely varied design and daringly unconventional arrangements of color, with strong characterization and a likeness that <b>never</b> <b>fails</b> to be convincing," [...] and added, [...] "her concern with the artistic problem never makes her obtrude her own personality or offend the sitter's susceptibilities." ...|$|E

The concluding observation is as follows: 'As time <b>never</b> <b>fails,</b> and the universe is eternal, neither the Tanais, nor the Nile, can have flowed for ever. The places where they rise were once dry, {{and there is a}} limit to their operations, but there is none to time.

[...] Pareles added, [...] "Boudoir ballads undulate in torrid slow motion while Ms. Jackson moans like a phone-sex operator, and uptempo tunes hark back to disco, splice mock-operetta to hard rock or, in Better Days, conjure an easy-listening 1960's-pop apotheosis." [...] Her vocals were also praised, saying [...] "Countless overdubs of Ms. Jackson's voice turn her into an airborne choir; computer rhythms thump and sizzle."
