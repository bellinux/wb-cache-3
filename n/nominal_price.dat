500|$|Walter Law {{encouraged}} his Briarcliff Farms {{employees to}} move into the village, selling [...] or [...] plots of land to workers for a <b>nominal</b> <b>price.</b> He asked workers to choose the type of house they wanted; he would have it built and hold the mortgage, or allow them to rent a cottage. Law built several wood-framed cottages near the farms, with steep front-gable roofs and open porches using some of the first-floor space. Of the cottages still standing, six are on Dalmeny Road and three are on Old Briarcliff Road. The farm also owned and operated a farm in Peekskill previously owned by John Paulding, a militiaman who helped capture British major John André, running the Peekskill farm as a nursery for maples, oaks, lindens, hemlocks, spruces and other trees. During the early 1900s Law purchased farms in Lewisboro and Pound Ridge, using those farms to replenish the main farm's cattle herd. He also purchased a house in Pound Ridge, which his Briarcliff Realty Company sold to Westchester County after his death; it became the headquarters of the Ward Pound Ridge Reservation, the county's largest park.|$|E

Real exchange rates are extremely volatile, suggesting that temporary shocks emanate from the monetary sector. But the half-life of real exchange rate deviations is extremely large – 2. 5 to 5 years. This halflife seems too large to {{be explained by the}} slow adjustment of <b>nominal</b> <b>prices.</b> We offer a different interpretation. We maintain that nominal exchange rates and prices need not converge at the same rate, as is implicit in rational-expectations sticky-price models of the exchange rate. Evidence from an unobserved components model for <b>nominal</b> <b>prices</b> and <b>nominal</b> exchange rates that imposes relative {{purchasing power}} parity in the long run indicates that nominal exchange rates converge much more slowly than <b>nominal</b> <b>prices.</b> The real puzzle is why nominal exchange rates converge so slowly...|$|R

2500|$|... "A {{circumstance}} which has, perhaps, {{more than}} any other, contributed to conceal this oscillation from common view, {{is the difference between}} the nominal and real price of labour. It very rarely happens that the <b>nominal</b> <b>price</b> of labour universally falls; but we well know that it frequently remains the same, while the <b>nominal</b> <b>price</b> of provisions has been gradually rising. This, indeed, will generally be the case, if the increase of manufactures and commerce be sufficient to employ the new labourers that are thrown into the market, and to prevent the increased supply from lowering the money-price. But an increased number of labourers receiving the same money-wages will necessarily, by their competition, increase the money-price of corn. This is, in fact, a real fall in the price of labour; and, during this period, the condition of the lower classes of the community must be gradually growing worse. But the farmers and capitalists are growing rich from the real cheapness of labour. Their increasing capitals enable them to employ a greater number of men; and, as the population had probably suffered some check from the greater difficulty of supporting a family, the demand for labour, after a certain period, would be great in proportion to the supply, and its price would of course rise, if left to find its natural level; and thus the wages of labour, and consequently the condition of the lower classes of society, might have progressive and retrograde movements, though the price of labour might never nominally fall.|$|E
