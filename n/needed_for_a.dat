A clinical diagnosis is considered made when, with lentigines present there are 2 other symptoms observed, such as ECG abnormalities and ocular hypertelorism, or without lentigines, 3 of the above conditions are present, with a first-degree relative (i.e. parent, child, sibling) with a clinical diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Advances {{of funds}} – Advances are federal funds {{provided}} to a recipient {{before the program}} activity is performed. Recipients determine the amount <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> future expenditure (e.g., through budget process) and request the amount {{to the federal government}} (or in the case of subrecipients to the pass-through entity, see Subrecipient Monitoring below). The federal funds received are then expended to perform the specific activity (e.g., purchase good or service or for payroll). However, laws and regulations require recipients to request funds only when it is immediately needed, and recipients must try to minimize the amount of time between the receipts of funds to the actual disbursement. Examples of programs under these funding techniques are the Section 8 program and the Community Development Block Grant program.|$|E
5|$|After Resaca de la Palma, Mexican {{forces were}} cleared from the Texan {{side of the}} Rio Grande, but {{additional}} operations were required to force Mexico {{to agree to the}} border. The Mexican commander, General Mariano Arista, withdrew his forces to Linares, with Taylor in pursuit for sixty miles before returning to Fort Brown for reinforcements. He then marched against Monterrey. The heavily fortified city had a 10,000-man garrison under Arista's replacement, General Pedro de Ampudia, but its supply line running south to Saltillo was vulnerable. Lacking the heavy artillery <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> siege, Taylor planned a double envelopment, with one division executing a turning movement to cut the supply line and attack from the west and south, and his other two divisions assaulting {{the north side of the}} city.|$|E

5|$|Bakshi chose {{rotoscoping}} as {{a cost-effective}} way {{to complete the}} movie's battle scenes with his own finances. Because he {{could not afford to}} hire a film crew or actors, or develop 35mm stock, Bakshi requested prints of films that contained the type of large battle scenes needed, including Sergei Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, and spliced together the footage he needed. However, the cost of printing photographs of each frame would have cost $3 million. Learning that IBM had introduced an industrial-sized photocopier, Bakshi asked one of the company's technical experts if {{he would be able to}} feed 35mm reels into the machine to produce enlarged copies of each frame. The experiment worked, and Bakshi got the pages he <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> penny per copy.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{a variety}} of factors, {{including}} the deterioration of the main campus building dating from 1844 and the need for additional space, the university considered building a new building designed specifically for the university beginning in the 1850s. Then on October 3, 1860, the board of trustees for the school resolved {{to begin the process of}} building a new primary hall to be used by the university. Reverend Alvin F. Waller was placed in charge of the efforts to raise the funds <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> building. However, this was unsuccessful and on November 19, 1862, the board again passed a resolution calling for a new structure and forming a committee of Waller, Gustavus Hines, Josiah Lamberson Parrish, J.

5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the war the Arctic front remained stale. The German High Command did not regard it as an important theatre and therefore refrained from transferring the substantial reinforcements <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> renewal of the offensive. The Finns likewise were not interested in continuing the offensive on their own as {{they did not want to}} antagonize the Western Allies further. In September 1944, following a series of devastating German defeats, the Finns sued for peace with the Soviet Union and had to give up all their territorial conquests. The Germans subsequently retreated from Central Finland to Petsamo and Norway. In October 1944, the Red Army conducted the Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation and achieved a decisive victory over the German forces in the Arctic by completely expelling them from Finland.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to determine if supervisors and subordinates perceived <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> formal training program on apprehending shoplifters. The study also determined whether supervisors perceived a greater or lesser <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> formal training program than did subordinates. Twenty supervisors and 70 subordinates from four retail locations were administered a Shoplifting Awareness Survey. It was found that both supervisors and subordinates perceived <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> formal training program. The data revealed that supervisors perceived the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> training program to be as strong as the need perceived by subordinates. Subordinates overwhelmingly indicated that they would feel more comfortable apprehending a shoplifter if they had been through a formal training program.

40|$|Purpose: This {{research}} {{was designed to}} investigate the effects of forensic education and autopsy attitude of nursing students. Meth-ods: Data on autopsy attitude were determined and collected {{by means of a}} self-reporting questionnaire including 14 questions on perception of <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> autopsy and 11 questions on resistance to autopsy, the respondents being 846 nursing students. The col-lected data were analyzed by means of an independent t-test with one-way ANOVA in an SPSS WIn 18. 0 program. Results: The per-ception of <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> autopsy was 4. 06 on average and resistance to autopsy was 2. 64 on average. The nursing students taking a forensic course showed a relatively higher level of perception of the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> autopsy (t =- 5. 63, p <. 001) than those not attending such a course (t = 2. 93, p <. 001).

Howl's frequent disappearances are because of his womanizing habits, which makes Sophie see him as a superficial and cowardly person. In the film, however, Howl disappears from the scene in order to transform into a giant bird and disrupt the battle plans of both armies.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} Alzheimer's disease is poorly understood. About 70% {{of the risk}} is {{believed}} to be genetic with many genes usually involved. Other risk factors include a history of head injuries, depression, or hypertension. The disease process is associated with plaques and tangles in the brain. A probable diagnosis is based {{on the history of the}} illness and cognitive testing with medical imaging and blood tests to rule out other possible causes. Initial symptoms are often mistaken for normal ageing. Examination of brain tissue is <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> definite diagnosis. Mental and physical exercise, and avoiding obesity may decrease the risk of AD; however, evidence to support these recommendations is not strong. There are no medications or supplements that decrease risk.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, made {{the development of}} an atomic bomb a theoretical possibility. Fears that a German atomic bomb project would develop atomic weapons first, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, were expressed in the Einstein-Szilard letter. This prompted preliminary research in the United States in late 1939. Progress was slow until the arrival of the British MAUD Committee report in late 1941, which indicated that only 5–10 kilograms of isotopically enriched uranium-235 was <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bomb instead of tons of un-enriched uranium and a neutron moderator (e.g. heavy water).|$|E

5|$|At an intersection, the {{incoming}} and outgoing lanes of traffic (including {{the ends of}} pedestrian crosswalks and bicycle lanes as well as lanes for motor vehicles) may be represented as the vertices of a graph, placed on the spine of a book embedding in their clockwise order around the junction. The paths through the intersection taken by traffic to get from an incoming lane to an outgoing lane may be represented as the edges of an undirected graph. For instance, this graph might have an edge from an incoming to an outgoing lane of traffic that both {{belong to the same}} segment of road, representing a U-turn from that segment back to that segment, only if U-turns are allowed at the junction. For a given subset of these edges, the subset represents a collection of paths that can all be traversed without interference from each other if and only if the subset does not include any pair of edges that would cross if the two edges were placed in a single page of a book embedding. Thus, a book embedding of this graph describes a partition of the paths into non-interfering subsets, and the book thickness of this graph (with its fixed embedding on the spine) gives the minimum number of distinct phases <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> signalling schedule that includes all possible traffic paths through the junction.|$|E
5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 20,000 tickets, {{out of a}} total capacity of 52,063. The remaining seats are accounted for by Hampden Park debenture holders, hospitality, sponsors, media and segregation areas. In excess of 1,000 unused debentures were distributed to each club. The allocation was enough to provide for the season ticket holders of each club, with Hearts having 10,000 and Hibs 7,500 approximately, although both clubs anticipated that there would be little or no need for a general public sale. Hearts decided to sell tickets using their loyalty points system, while Hibs connected their allocation to sales of season tickets and memberships. Due to high demand, Hearts tightened the criteria <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> ticket during the sales process. Regular tickets cost £35 or £28 for adults and £10 for children under 15 years old.|$|E
5|$|Experimental {{electric}} fire-engines {{were made}} for testing in France, Germany and England starting {{in the latter part}} of the nineteenth century. Siemens Brothers Company of London built and experimented with an electric fire engine in 1891. It was shown at the Royal Naval Exhibition in England in 1892. The Paris Fire Department experimented with a self-propelled electric fire engine in 1899. The French electric fire engine, known to them as the automobile pump, was first exhibited at the 1900 World's Fair in Paris and became very popular during its first six months of successful operation. It was demonstrated that this electric fire-engine allowed firemen to begin to extinguish a fire four minutes earlier than a steam fire engine. The fire-engine was self-propelled by on board batteries, and carried a water tank with hundreds of gallons of water that could be used immediately at the site of the fire. The hoses were then connected to the city fire hydrants for more water if <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> large fire. In 1901, the Paris Fire Department put an electric fire engine into successful operation that also had a hook-and-ladder wagon. It had an electric motor-driven water pump to which hoses were attached for the firemen to use.|$|E
