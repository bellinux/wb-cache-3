5|$|Pinkham <b>Notch</b> (elevation 2032ft. / 619 m) is a {{mountain}} {{pass in the}} White Mountains of north-central New Hampshire, United States. The <b>notch</b> {{is a result of}} extensive erosion by the Laurentide ice sheet during the Wisconsinian ice age. Pinkham <b>Notch</b> was eroded into a glacial U-shaped valley whose walls are formed by the Presidential, Wildcat, and Carter-Moriah ranges. Due to the volatility of the area's climate and rugged character of the terrain, a number of rare or endemic ecosystems have developed throughout the <b>notch.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} pathology was {{noticed by}} Parks, and {{from around the}} <b>notch.</b> In the fourth, fifth, and sixth vertebrae, directly anterior to the <b>notch,</b> the neural spines were damaged. The fourth had an obvious fracture, {{with the other two}} possessing a swelling {{at the base of the}} break.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{believed}} {{it was important to}} preserve the scenic value of New Hampshire's forests. Between 1903 and 1911, he helped with efforts to establish White Mountain National Forest. Among his many civic activities, Brown promoted early legislative efforts to protect public riding trails. He also helped New Hampshire acquire Franconia <b>Notch</b> and Crawford <b>Notch</b> as public lands, and established a river conservation group in Quebec.|$|E
40|$|We analyze a radius bone {{fragment}} of a raven (Corvus corax) from Zaskalnaya VI rock shelter, Crimea. The object bears seven <b>notches</b> and {{comes from an}} archaeological level attributed to a Micoquian industry dated to between 38 and 43 cal kyr BP. Our study aims to examine the degree of regularity and intentionality of this set of <b>notches</b> through their technological and morphometric analysis, complemented by comparative experimental work. Microscopic analysis of the <b>notches</b> indicate that they were produced by the to-and-fro movement of a lithic cutting edge and that two <b>notches</b> were added {{to fill in the}} gap left between previously cut <b>notches,</b> probably to increase the visual consistency of the pattern. Multivariate analysis of morphometric data recorded on the archaeological <b>notches</b> and sets of <b>notches</b> cut by nine modern experimenters on radii of domestic turkeys shows that the variations recorded on the Zaskalnaya set are comparable to experimental sets made with the aim of producing similar, parallel, equidistant <b>notches.</b> Identification of the Weber Fraction, the constant that accounts for error in human perception, for equidistant <b>notches</b> cut on bone rods and its application to the Zaskalnaya set of <b>notches</b> and thirty-six sets of <b>notches</b> incised on seventeen Upper Palaeolithic bone objects from seven sites indicate that the Zaskalnaya set falls within the range of variation of regularly spaced experimental and Upper Palaeolithic sets of <b>notches.</b> This suggests that even if the production of the <b>notches</b> may have had a utilitarian reason the <b>notches</b> were made with the goal of producing a visually consistent pattern. This object represents the first instance of a bird bone from a Neanderthal site bearing modifications that cannot be explained as the result of butchery activities and for which a symbolic argument can be built on direct rather than circumstantial evidence...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A new {{configuration}} of wideband bandpass filter (BPF) with <b>notched</b> bands is presented. Proposed BPF {{is based on}} stepped-impedance resonator. By utilizing dual steppedimpedance resonators in folded topology a rectangular-ring resonator is formed. Two <b>notched</b> bands in the passband are achieved without using asymmetrical coupled lines. In other words, the filter configuration is capable of producing <b>notched</b> bands.

50|$|Of all the 30 <b>notches,</b> 1-21 are DC <b>notches</b> {{allowing}} {{series operation}} of traction motors. Rest of the 8 <b>notches</b> allow series-parallel combination under DC. Under AC, the combinations are 3S-2P and 2S-3P. These locomotives could {{run in parallel}} combination but it was discouraged due to power problems under DC. Under AC, the locomotives are run under parallel <b>notches</b> nearly always. Although these engines are not rebuilt to use only parallel combination under AC. Field weakening of traction motors is possible at 21st and 30th <b>notches.</b> Voltage control is by Tap changer operation under AC and Resistance <b>notching</b> under DC. Traction motors are charged by DC. Its prototypes were tested in the year 1971.|$|R
5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, the Great <b>Notch</b> station, which was falling into disrepair, {{received}} a new paint job, {{changed from the}} red-green colors for the Erie Lackawanna to a new all red Erie Railroad paint scheme. The abandoned tool shed made {{out of the old}} wooden boxcar was also removed. Due to the removal of the tool boxcar, the propane tanks that heated the station building were also made visible. After the ending of the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad in 1976, the Great <b>Notch</b> station lay abandoned. In June 1979, the State of New Jersey began to remove the tracks for the Caldwell Branch, which also lay abandoned at Great <b>Notch.</b> Currently, what was the track leading to the Caldwell Branch is a siding. On January 20, 1988, the newly rehabilitated station building was destroyed by fire. During the construction of the Montclair Connection in 2001, the adjacent Great <b>Notch</b> Yard received a major upgrade, becoming a new state-of-the-art yard with new trains storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|Other {{features}} of the skull distinguish the two genera. The tegmen tympani, {{the roof of the}} tympanic cavity, is much reduced in Voalavo relative to Eliurus. The subsquamosal fenestrae, openings in the squamosal bone {{at the back of the}} skull, are larger in Voalavo than in Eliurus. The zygomatic plate, a plate at the sides of the skull that roots the front part of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), is narrower in Voalavo, and lacks a clear zygomatic <b>notch</b> (a <b>notch</b> formed by a projection at the front of the zygomatic plate), which is present in Eliurus. Among nesomyines, only Brachytarsomys has a more reduced zygomatic <b>notch.</b>|$|E
5|$|The climate, {{and as a}} result, {{the flora}} and fauna, of Pinkham <b>Notch</b> varies greatly with elevation. As {{elevations}} increase {{on the walls of}} the <b>notch,</b> climate and ecosystems change to those of increasingly northern occurrence. Biomes range from a low-elevation northern hardwood forest at the base of Mount Washington to alpine-Arctic vegetation near the summit comparable to vegetation found at the latitude of Labrador.|$|E
40|$|Spatial frequency-selective minima (<b>notches)</b> in the {{contrast}} sensitivity function (CSF) because of defocus can mimic those that occur with ocular disease. We examined {{the influence of}} measure-ment conditions on CSF shape in simulated clinical testing. CSF <b>notches</b> occurred with almost all levels of defocus for all subjects. Multiple <b>notches</b> were found under some conditions. <b>Notches</b> were found with defocus as small as 0. 50 D. Effects of induced astigmatism depended on {{the orientation of the}} target. <b>Notches</b> were apparent in defocus conditions after stimulus size and room illuminance were modified and when subjects had insufficient accommodation to compensate for hypermetropic defocus. The equivalent of <b>notches</b> was not noted with the Pelli–Robson chart. As defocus-induced CSF <b>notches</b> may be mistaken for functional loss, careful refractive correction should be conducted prior to clinical or experimental CSF measurement, even at low spatia...|$|R
50|$|Tube <b>notching</b> is {{commonly}} performed before joining light-gauge tubes {{to make a}} tee or similar joint, as by welding. Either one or both tubes may be <b>notched</b> before assembly. A familiar example of tube <b>notching</b> is {{in the manufacture of}} bicycle frames.|$|R

5|$|The <b>notch</b> first {{appears in}} {{recorded}} history in 1784, when an expedition led by Jeremy Belknap camped in the <b>notch</b> before ascending {{to the summit}} of Mount Washington through Huntington Ravine. Pinkham <b>Notch</b> was far more isolated than neighboring Crawford Notch; as a result, the first settler of Pinkham <b>Notch</b> came in 1827, 43years after habitation of Crawford <b>Notch.</b> The first settler, Hayes Copp, built a homestead in the then-uninhabited area, near where the Dolly Copp campground stands today. Copp and his wife lived alone in the wilderness until Daniel Pinkham completed the first road through the <b>notch</b> between in 1836, finally providing {{a link between the}} Copp homestead and civilization. In 1851, a railroad was built to Gorham, and a hotel, the Glen House, was constructed to accommodate passengers. Mount Washington was the main attraction in the area; a bridle path was constructed from the Glen House to hotels on the summit, which was later improved into what would become the Mount Washington Auto Road. Completion of the road in 1861 led to a massive increase in tourism.|$|E
5|$|When {{radially}} broaching workpieces {{that require}} a deep cut per tooth, such as forgings or castings, a rotor-cut or jump-cut design can be used; these broaches are also known as free egress or nibbling broaches. In this design the RPT is designated {{to two or three}} rows of teeth. For the broach to work the first tooth of that cluster has a wide <b>notch,</b> or undercut, and then the next tooth has a smaller <b>notch</b> (in a three tooth design) and the final tooth has no <b>notch.</b> This allows for a deep cut while keeping stresses, forces, and power requirements low.|$|E
5|$|Ballard {{left the}} Golden Gophers seventh all-time among team defensemen with 33 goals. He {{was also the}} 74th player in team history to <b>notch</b> 100 points, which also ranked him 11th among defensemen.|$|E
50|$|<b>Notching</b> is a {{low-cost}} process, particularly for its low tooling costs {{with a small}} range of standard punches. The capital cost of the punch press can be expensive though, so small fabrication shops often out-source their <b>notching</b> work to a press shop or <b>notching</b> specialist. <b>Notching</b> of large or heavy sections, particularly for large tube fabrication or HVAC, is increasingly carried out by plasma cutting rather than punch tools.|$|R
40|$|In this article, a {{wideband}} {{monopole antenna}} with band <b>notched</b> reconfigurability is proposed. The antenna {{consists of a}} wideband monopole antenna, incorporated with reconfigurable electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structures. Six EBG structures with different band <b>notched</b> frequency are used to achieve six band <b>notched</b> reconfigurations. The EBG structures are placed underneath the feed line of the antenna. A switch is placed at each EBG structure, and by controlling {{the state of the}} switch, the band <b>notched</b> operation of the EBG can be activated or deactivated. The proposed antenna is capable to provide useful features for the <b>notched</b> band UWB communication system...|$|R
5000|$|The {{central column}} begins with three <b>notches</b> and then doubles to 6 <b>notches.</b> The process is {{repeated}} {{for the number}} 4, which doubles to 8 <b>notches,</b> and then reversed for the number 10, which is halved to 5 <b>notches.</b> These numbers may not be purely random and instead suggest some understanding {{of the principle of}} multiplication and division by two. The bone may therefore have been used as a counting tool for simple mathematical procedures.|$|R
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{relatively}} long. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend {{in front of}} the incisors, forming a rostral tube, which is shared among oryzomyines only with Handleyomys. The zygomatic <b>notch</b> (a <b>notch</b> formed by a projection {{at the front of the}} zygomatic plate, a bony plate at the side of the skull) is shallow. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is narrow and long, with the narrowest part towards the front. The crests on the braincase and interorbital region are weakly developed. Eremoryzomys has larger crests on its interorbital region.|$|E
5|$|The Great <b>Notch</b> train station, {{formerly}} known as Caldwell Junction, was a small New Jersey Transit facility in the Great <b>Notch</b> section of Little Falls, New Jersey. The station was served seven times a day, three inbound morning trains to Hoboken Terminal and four outbound evening trains from Hoboken by the Montclair-Boonton Line from Monday to Friday. Located {{at the intersection of}} <b>Notch</b> Road and Long Hill Road, it was the second of three stations in Little Falls, the other two being Montclair State University and Little Falls, and was the first on the line to be strictly served by diesel trains. However, most trains bypassed this station and continued on to Little Falls (westbound) and Montclair State University (eastbound). The station was served by a single track with an unused side track. The last trains stopped at the station on January 15, 2010, at 7:41pm.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} {{stacking}} sequence on the unnotched and <b>notched</b> strength of E-glass/epoxy fabric laminates has been studied. The stacking sequence alters the un-notched and <b>notched</b> strength. The failure mechanisms {{in these two}} cases are different. As a result, the hierarchies of unnotched and <b>notched</b> strength based on stacking sequence variation are different. The failure mechanisms have been discussed. The effect of stacking sequence on the unnotched and <b>notched</b> strength of woven fabric composites are compared with the UD tape laminate results reported earlier. Based on the experimental observa-tions, some guidelines are given to choose the optimum stacking sequence for unnotched and <b>notched</b> composites...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of fatigue crack propagation of round bar specimens of S 35 C with {{one to three}} sharp <b>notches</b> was investigated and the results obtained are summarized as follows; 1) Crack length at <b>notches</b> that did not fracture increased with the overstress ratio and saturated at some ratio. 2) The ratio of the crack propagation period in the total fatigue life {{was estimated to be}} about 98 %, regardless of the number of <b>notches</b> and applied stress. 3) The {{behavior of}} crack propagation on specimens with two and three <b>notches</b> was found to be explained well with stress intensity factors accounting for interaction between <b>notches</b> by the principle of superposition. ...|$|R
5|$|The skull is {{delicate}} and lightly built. The rostrum, the front {{part of the}} skull, is narrow and fairly long; it is shorter in eastern voalavo. The narrow zygomatic plate (a plate {{on the side of}} the skull) extends back to about the front of the first upper molar (M1). The zygomatic <b>notch,</b> a <b>notch</b> in the upper part of the zygomatic plate, is small. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are narrow, but as usual in nesomyines contain a relatively long jugal bone. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is narrow and short and lacks accessory shelves and ridges. The braincase also lacks such ridges.|$|E
5|$|All of the fins, {{particularly}} the narrow pectoral fins, are falcate (sickle-shaped) to some degree. The medium-sized first dorsal fin originates {{just behind the}} pectoral fin rear tips. The second dorsal fin is about two-thirds as tall as the first, {{and there is no}} midline ridge running between them. The pelvic fins are broad and slightly larger than the anal fin. The anal fin has a strong <b>notch</b> in the trailing margin and is positioned slightly behind the second dorsal fin. The caudal peduncle bears a crescent-shaped <b>notch</b> at the upper origin of the caudal fin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral <b>notch</b> near the tip. The prominent lateral line curves downward below the second dorsal fin. The skin is densely covered by small, overlapping dermal denticles; each bears five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is light grey to bronze above, darkening at the tips of the second dorsal fin and upper caudal fin lobe (though this may be indistinct in larger sharks), and pale below. The underside is off-white, and the first dorsal fin has a pale trailing margin.|$|E
5|$|American {{forces were}} quick to counter the attack. M20 {{recoilless}} rifles destroyed the machine gun positions, and American mortars began firing on any North Korean positions they could locate. However, North Korean forces {{were quick to}} advance up the <b>Notch,</b> to {{the crest of the}} hill that made up the pass. There, the discovered B Company, 19th Infantry, encamped. The 19th Infantry was apparently not prepared for combat, as North Korean forces were able to hit the American force and drive it off the hill, killing several of the American soldiers with bayonets. At about 12:00, B Company was driven from the crest of the <b>Notch,</b> and further confusion erupted when US Air Force aircraft accidentally strafed the retreating B Company. Neighboring positions also mistakenly attacked B Company, which retreated with 12 killed.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: An {{analysis}} of data from the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS) has found eyes reported to have partial optic disc rim <b>notching</b> (not to the edge) at baseline to have less risk of subsequent visual field loss than eyes with no <b>notching.</b> Because this is counterintuitive and because classification of <b>notching</b> had not been defined in the AGIS protocol, we have assessed AGIS ophthalmologists interobserver and intraobserver agreement on <b>notching.</b> METHODS: Fourteen glaucoma subspecialists classified <b>notching</b> in 26 pairs of stereoscopic disc photographs of eyes with mild to severe glaucomatous optic neuropathy. They classified images as showing either no <b>notching,</b> <b>notching</b> not to the edge, or <b>notching</b> to the edge. Several hours later, 10 of them classified the same images a second time. RESULTS: In an {{analysis of}} interobserver agreement, of 26 stereoscopic images, a plurality of ophthalmologists classified <b>notching</b> as absent in 9 (35 %), as present {{but not to the}} edge in 7 (27 %), and as present and not to the edge in 10 (38 %). All 14 ophthalmologists (100 %) agreed on the classification of 7 (27 %) of the images, and 13 of the 14 ophthalmologists (93 %) agreed on the classification of 4 additional images (15 %). Of these 11 images with at least 93 % agreement, <b>notching</b> was reported as absent in 3 (27 %) and to the edge in 8 (73 %). In the remaining 15 images, there was substantial disagreement about whether <b>notching</b> was present and, if so, whether it was to the edge. In an analysis of intraobserver agreement, none of the 10 ophthalmologists who completed the viewing a second time classified all eyes exactly the same as the first time, though 5 ophthalmologists made 4 or fewer reclassifications. Overall, 80 % of the original classifications were reproduced on second reading. Of the initial classifications that were not reproduced, slightly more than half were first classified as having <b>notching</b> not to the edge. CONCLUSION: Without definitions or examples of optic disc rim <b>notching,</b> the glaucoma subspecialists had relatively high intraobserver agreement but were likely to disagree with each other in characterizing the degree of disc rim <b>notching.</b> We recommend development of a standard photographic classification of disc rim <b>notching.</b> The classification should be tested for inter- and intra-observer agreement...|$|R

5|$|Fighting at the <b>Notch</b> {{continued}} through the afternoon, but, the attack still unsuccessful, the North Korean troops withdrew suddenly in the mid-afternoon, allowing American forces to recover most of the casualties and vehicles from the <b>Notch.</b> In the meantime, they set up roadblocks to prevent further North Korean attacks from moving down the road. North Korean forces disengaged from the fight without attempting to flank the Americans, and by nightfall {{they were out of}} the region. In the meantime, the 27th Infantry Regiment surprised a large column of North Korean forces advancing on the south road and captured many trucks of supplies. During the North Koreans' retreat from the two roads, US Air Force planes mounted an airstrike against the North Koreans and inflicted heavy casualties.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{impact of}} infraglenoidal {{scapular}} <b>notching</b> in reversed total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) is still controversially discussed. Our {{goal was to}} evaluate its potential influence on subjective shoulder stability and clinical outcome. We hypothesized that subjective instability and clinical outcome after implantation of RTSA correlates with objective scapular <b>notching.</b> Methods Sixty shoulders were assessed preoperatively and at minimum 2 -year follow-up for active range of motion and by use of the Oxford instability score, Rowe score for instability, Constant score for pain, Constant shoulder score, DASH score. All shoulders were evaluated on anterior-posterior and axillary lateral radiographic views. These X-ray scans were classified twice by two orthopaedic surgeons with respect to infraglenoidal scapular <b>notching</b> according to the classification of Nerot. <b>Notching</b> was tested for correlation with clinical outcome scores to the evaluated <b>notching.</b> Results We found no significant correlation between infraglenoidal scapular <b>notching</b> and clinical outcomes after a mid-term follow-up from 24 to 60 months, but at the final follow-up of 60 months and more, we did see statistically significant, positive correlations between infraglenoidal scapular <b>notching</b> and the Constant pain score as well as active range of motion. At mean follow-up of 42 months (range from 24 to 96 months) we found no significant correlation between subjective instability and infraglenoidal scapular <b>notching.</b> Conclusions We conclude that patients' subjective impression on their shoulders' stability is not correlating with radiological signs of infraglenoidal scapular <b>notching.</b> Nevertheless clinical parameters are affected by infraglenoidal scapular <b>notching,</b> {{at least in the}} long term</p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe tested two marking {{techniques}} for adult small hive beetles (SHB) : dusting and thoracic <b>notching.</b> The use {{of blue and}} red chalk dusts to mark beetles was not persistent and caused early death of SHB with an average survival of 52. 6 [*]±[*] 23. 8 and 13. 9 [*]±[*] 7. 3  days, respectively. In contrast, <b>notched</b> beetles survived longer (mean[*]=[*] 353. 6 [*]±[*] 5. 3  days) with the last beetle dying after 383  days. Likewise, <b>notched</b> beetles (presumed to be injured because of oozing hemolymph from the <b>notched</b> area) also lived long {{with an average of}} 193. 6 [*]±[*] 38. 8  days. <b>Notching</b> also resulted in a high rate of recovery; 81 % for beetles introduced directly into a nucleus colony, and 59 % and 66 % for a nucleus colony and pole traps, respectively, for beetles released inside a screen tent. These high recovery rates confirmed that <b>notching</b> did not interfere with the beetles' ability to fly. However, it appeared that <b>notched</b> females laid more eggs than those that were not <b>notched</b> both with multiple (171. 70 [*]±[*] 11. 20 vs 126. 87 [*]±[*] 10. 27 eggs per day) and single (70. 02 [*]±[*] 5. 45 vs 57. 97 [*]±[*] 5. 12 eggs per day) pairs for a period of 1 - 3  days. Whether or not <b>notching</b> affects lifetime fecundity of females was not assessed in this study. Nevertheless, <b>notching</b> is a permanent mark for SHB and thus, may be useful in many ecological studies or in studying the efficacy of lures and traps for SHB control...|$|R
