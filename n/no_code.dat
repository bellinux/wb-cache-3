5|$|<b>No</b> <b>Code</b> sold 366,500copies in {{its first}} week of release, topping the Billboard 200, but falling short of analysts' {{predictions}} of at least 535,000 copies. This was significantly less than what the band's previous two albums sold in their respective first weeks of release. It was, however, the seventh biggest-selling debut of what was a slow year for the industry. It stayed at number one for two weeks, and was Pearl Jam's last album to debut at {{number one on the}} album chart until Backspacer was released in 2009. <b>No</b> <b>Code</b> was the band's first album to not reach multi-platinum status, being certified platinum by the RIAA, and, as of 2013, has sold 1.75 millioncopies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>No</b> <b>Code</b> debuted {{at number}} one on the Billboard 200, it left a large section of the band’s fanbase {{unsatisfied}} and quickly fell down the charts. Critical reviews were also mixed, with praise to the musical variety but the album being considered inconsistent. The album became the first Pearl Jam album to not reach multi-platinum status, receiving a single platinum certification by the RIAA in the United States.|$|E

5|$|<b>No</b> <b>Code</b> is {{the fourth}} studio album by the American rock band Pearl Jam, {{released}} on August 27, 1996 through Epic Records. Following a troubled tour for its previous album, Vitalogy (1994), in which Pearl Jam engaged in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster, the band went into the studio to record its follow-up. The music on the record was more diverse than what the band had done on previous releases, incorporating elements of garage rock and worldbeat.|$|E
5|$|Yield sold 358,000copies {{during its}} first week of release, and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 album chart. It was held off the top spot by the Titanic soundtrack. Yield became Pearl Jam's first album not to peak at {{number one on the}} Billboard charts since Ten in 1991. However, Yield has been {{certified}} platinum by the RIAA, and eventually outsold its predecessor <b>No</b> <b>Code</b> with 1.9 millioncopies in the United States as of 2013 according to Nielsen SoundScan.|$|E
5|$|Pearl Jam {{promoted}} the album with tours in North America and Europe {{in the fall}} of 1996. The short tour of North America focused on the East Coast of the United States. As with Vitalogy, very little touring was done in the United States to promote <b>No</b> <b>Code</b> because of the band's refusal to play in Ticketmaster's venues. The band chose to use alternate ticketing companies for the shows. A European tour followed {{in the fall of}} 1996, of which the band's November 3, 1996 show in Berlin, Germany at Deutschlandhalle was broadcast on many radio stations worldwide.|$|E

5|$|The album debuted {{at number}} one on the Billboard 200 with 189,000 copies sold in its first week of release, the only {{independent}} release to top the Billboard 200 that year. It is the first Pearl Jam album to reach number one in the United States since <b>No</b> <b>Code</b> debuted at number one in 1996. 7,000 of those copies were on vinyl, the highest first week total for LPs in 2009. On the Billboard 200 dated May 22, 2010, Backspacer logged its 32nd week on the chart, making the album Pearl Jam's longest-charting album since 1998's Yield. Backspacer was certified Gold by the RIAA on January 28, 2010 and has sold 635,000 copies , according to Soundscan. It also topped the charts in Canada, where it was certified Platinum; Australia, also going Platinum; and New Zealand, being certified Gold.|$|E

The pictures, when viewed from afar, blend to form the <b>No</b> <b>Code</b> triangle/eyeball logo that is the theme throughout the album. The CD and vinyl came with lyrics printed on the back of replica Polaroids. Only nine Polaroids came in a set, leaving one to have to obtain another set to accumulate all thirteen songs.|$|E
5|$|Yield is {{the fifth}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Pearl Jam, released on February 3, 1998. Following a short promotional tour for its previous album, <b>No</b> <b>Code</b> (1996), Pearl Jam recorded Yield throughout 1997 at Studio Litho and Studio X in Seattle, Washington. The album was proclaimed as {{a return to the}} band's early, straightforward rock sound, and marked a more collaborative effort from the band as opposed to relying heavily on frontman Eddie Vedder to compose the songs. The lyrics deal with contemplative themes, albeit seen in a more positive manner compared to the band's earlier work.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{performance}} of Space Time Codes (STC) & Quasi Orthogonal Space Time Block Codes (QOSTBC) has been analyzed. Use of multiple antennas is an emerging approach for recovering fading and reducing the bit error rate. Space diversity is introduced in space time codes. In Alamouti Space Time Code (STC) two transmit antennas are used that provide relatively better results than <b>no</b> <b>coding</b> approach. Alamouti uses a code matrix at transmitter and at receiver end it uses MLD and estimates the output signals. Space time block codes are with arbitrary number of antennas. It uses a huge code matrix at encoder and decodes using MLD. QOSTBC {{is one of the}} latest variants of the STBCs. The encoded symbols are mapped in the transmission matrix which is decoded at the receiver end using pair wise maximum likelihood decoding (MLD). Pair wise MLD is the specialty of the QOSTBC. The performance of STBC is far better than Alamouti and has no match with <b>no</b> <b>coding.</b> The performance comparison of QOSTBC, Alamouti, STBC and <b>no</b> <b>coding</b> is showed using simulations in MATLAB. Space time codes works with the price of redundancy bits and extra antenna price. Simulation results for QOSTBC also shows better performance with the price of slightly increased decoding complexity. 1...|$|R
