40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{phenylhydrazine}} induces hemolytic anemia. This is thought to result from the reaction of phenylhydrazine with hemoglobin. The accompanying oxidation of phenylhydrazine leads to the formation of a number of products, including benzene, <b>nitrogen,</b> hydrogen <b>peroxide,</b> superoxide anion and the phenyl radical. The products formed depend critically on the conditions of the experiment, especially the amount of oxygen present. It is now known that oxyhemoglobin and myoglobin react with phenylhydrazine to yield a derivative of hemoglobin containing N-phenylprotoporphyrin in which the heme group is modified. The recent identification of cr-phenyliron(III) porphyrins in phenylhydrazinemodified metmyoglobin has aided elucidation of the mechanism of hemoglobin modification. Mechanistic schemes are proposed to account for product formation...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{research}} was to study quantitatively possibilities of a continuous process of production of perchloric acid from <b>nitrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> and ammonium perchlorate. Perchloric acid has many properties which make it an important acid in industrial and analytical work and its use would be much greater if its cost of production could be lowered. It is a strong monobasic acid, stable in solutions (up to 60 %), has a high boiling point. There are relatively few insoluble salts (potassium, rubidium, caesium, and thallium perchlorates are only highly soluble) and the difference in solubilities of potassium and sodium perchlorates give an easy method of separation of these two metals in analytical work...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to establish a}} new technology, using pre-treatment with electrolyzed NaCl solutions and essential oil compounds, to extend the shelf-life of carp fillets. Samples of skinless carp fillets were treated with 100 -fold (by weight) of electrolyzed NaCl solutions [cathodic solution, EW(−) and/or anodic solution, EW(+) ] and 1 % oil (0. 5 % carvacrol + 0. 5 % thymol) [1 %(C + T) ]. Then chemical [pH, volatile basic <b>nitrogen,</b> <b>peroxide</b> value, and thiobarbituric acid], microbiological (total viable count) and sensory analyses were used to evaluate the preservative effect of this new technology during storage at 5 and 25 °C. Our results from the chemical assays indicated that EW(−), followed by EW(+) and subsequently 1 %(C + T) [EW(−) /EW(+) / 1 %(C + T) ], significantly suppressed the lipid oxidation compared with other treatments. Data from sensory evaluation and microbiological assay showed that treatment with EW(−) /EW(+) / 1 %(C + T) extended the shelf-life of carp fillets to 16 and 1. 3 days compared with 4 and 0. 3 days for the control samples during storage at 5 and 25 °C, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Nitro-{{fatty acids}} are electrophilic fatty acids {{produced}} in vivo from <b>nitrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> that have many physiological activities. We recently demonstrated that nitro-fatty acids activate the Keap 1 -Nrf 2 system, which protects cells from damage owing to electrophilic or oxidative stresses via transactivating {{an array of}} cytoprotective genes, although the molecular mechanism how they activate Nrf 2 is unclear. A number of chemical compounds with different structures {{have been reported to}} activate the Keap 1 -Nrf 2 system, which can be categorized into at least six classes based on their sensing pathways. In this study, we showed that nitro-oleic acid (OA-NO 2), one of major nitro-fatty acids, activates Nrf 2 in the same manner that of a cyclopentenone prostaglandin 15 -deoxy-Δ 12, 14 -prostaglandin J 2 (15 d-PGJ 2) using transgenic zebrafish that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) in response to Nrf 2 activators. In transgenic embryos, GFP was induced in the whole body by treatment with OA-NO 2, 15 d-PGJ 2 or diethylmaleate (DEM), but not with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), when exogenous Nrf 2 and Keap 1 were co-overexpressed. Induction by OA-NO 2 or 15 d-PGJ 2 but not DEM was observed, even when a C 151 S mutation was introduced in Keap 1. Our results support the contention that OA-NO 2 and 15 d-PGJ 2 share an analogous cysteine code as electrophiles and also have similar anti-inflammatory roles...|$|E

40|$|During October 19 - 20, 1991, one {{flight of}} the NASA Global Tropospheric Experiment (GTE) Pacific Exploratory Mission (PEM-West A) mission was {{conducted}} near Hawaii as an intercomparison with ground-based measurements of the Mauna Loa Observatory Photochemistry Experiment (MLOPEX 2) and the NOAA Climate Modeling and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL). Ozone, reactive <b>nitrogen</b> species, <b>peroxides,</b> hydrocarbons, and halogenated hydrocarbons were measured by investigators aboard the DC- 8 aircraft and at the ground site. Lidar cross sections of ozone revealed a complex air mass structure near the island of Hawaii which was evidenced by large variation in some trace gas mixing ratios. This variation limited the time and spatial scales for direct measurement intercomparisons. Where differences occurred between measurements in the same air masses, the intercomparison suggested that biases for some trace gases was due to different calibration scales or, in some cases, instrumental or sampling biases. Relatively large uncertainties were associated with those trace gases present in the low parts per trillion by volume range. Trace gas correlations were used to expand {{the scope of the}} intercomparison to identify consistent trends between the different data sets...|$|R

40|$|Pre-ignition and {{auto-ignition}} are uncontrolled ignition of combustible {{mixture in}} an engine by a hot surface. Pre-ignition {{is distinct from}} “knock ” or “detonation ” which {{is caused by the}} Apid com-bustion of {{the last part of the}} mixture following the initiation of flame by a spark. More work has been carried out on knock than pre-ignition because knock sets the primary limit to the possible power-output and fuel economy of an engine. Owing to increases in engine power in recent years, however, interest in pre-ignition has been revived, and this paper describes an investigation which was primarily directed to finding the pre-ignition ratings of various fuels. Two methods of obtaining pre-ignition ratings have been developed; with one a 500 C. C. single-cylinder water-cooled unit is used, having an electrically heated hot-spot to induce pre-ignition, and with the other a single-cylinder air-cooled air & engine with an air-cooled pre-igniter is used. A rating scale has been constructed in which iso-octane has been given the value of 100, and cumene zero. A large number of pure fuels from the paraffin, naphthene, aromatic, and alcohol groups have been rated for pre-ignition tendency using these methods. In addition, typical commercial motor-fuels, motor-racing fuels, and water-alcohol injection fluids have been tested. The relationship between pre-ignition tendency and the temperature of the hot-spot with normal running and with pre-ignition conditions has been established. The effects of engine variables, for example, mixture strength, speed, ignition advance, and air and cylinder temperatures, on pre-ignition, have been studied, in addition to the effects of important fuel additives such as tetraethyl lead and the aromatic amines. The additive tests include substances, such as formaldehyde and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>peroxide,</b> which are of interest from the chemical aspect and, based on the results, some information on the fundamental chemical processes involved in hot-spot ignition has been obtained...|$|E
40|$|Aged switchgrass seed lots {{can display}} {{various levels of}} {{dormancy}}. Under-standing the causes for this dormancy will provide better insight into seed physiology, and potentially lead to treatments that reduce variability in seed germination assays. The effects of sodium nitroprusside, potassium ferro-cyanide and hydrogen peroxide on the germination of eight aged switch-grass (Panicum virgatum L.) seed lots, seven of which were produced {{in the same year}} at a single experiment station, were examined. Seed germination demonstrated a significant seed lots × days and treatments × days effect. However, responses of individual seed lots to specific chemicals varied considerably. Genetically related seed lots did not display similar responses to the treatments, while switchgrass derived from a different germplasm exhibited a more similar response. Coleoptile emergence was significantly improved by chemical treatments and showed a significant seed lots × treatment interaction. Together, these results indicate (1) chemicals releasing re-active <b>nitrogen</b> species or <b>peroxide</b> can overcome residual dormancy and stimulate seed germination and coleoptile emergence in diverse switchgrassseed lots, and (2) multiple mechanisms, to some extent under genetic control, appear to direct switchgrass seed germination...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{characteristics of}} oxy- and deoxy-hemocyanins {{have been investigated}} using X-ray absorption spectroscopy both in the near-edge (XANES) {{and for the first}} shell contribution in the EXAFS region. Several arthropodan and molluscan hemocyanins have been studied in order to trace the inter- and intra-phyla differences. The XANES spectra of oxy-hemocyanins of the different species are remarkably similar, consistent with a very strongly conserved co-ordination geometry of the copper active site. In contrast, small but significant differences are observed between the deoxy-forms of arthropodan and molluscan proteins. In particular, the XANES spectra of deoxy-arthropodan hemocyanins (with the exception of L. polyphemus Hc) show a more intense edge feature at approximately 8983 eV. This difference is tentatively assigned to a more planar geometry of the copper-ligands system in the arthropodan rather than in the molluscan proteins. The first shell analysis of the EXAFS modulation is consistent with the presence of n = 3 N 2 imidazole nitrogens at an average distance of 1. 92 ± 0. 03 Å from copper in all the deoxy-hemocyanins investigated. Binding of dioxygen results for all hemocyanins in the increase of the number of first shell back-scattering atoms to n = 5 with average distances of 1. 93 Å. Alternatively, by separating the contribution of N 2 imidazole <b>nitrogens</b> and of <b>peroxide</b> O-atoms, n = 3 ligands at 1. 98 ± 0. 03 Å and n = 2 ligands at 1. 87 ± 0. 03 Å are found...|$|R

Sensory evaluation of general appearance, color, smell, consistency of flesh of all meat samples were done by a panel of five members and found the beef samples in acceptable condition. Proximate composition of MI, M 2, M 3, M 4 and M 5 decreased gradually with the increase of storage period. The initial protein, lipid, ash and moisture content of all samples were ranged 22. 06 to 23. 41 %, 3. 84 to 4. 20 %, 1. 02 % to 1. 16 % and 70. 28 to 72. 00 %, respectively.

40|$|Background. Salted fish {{products}} are popular {{in many countries}} around the world. Salting {{is one of the}} oldest techniques for fish preservation, and is essentially intended to increase the shelf-life of the product depressing water activity by means of dehydration and salt uptake by the fish muscle. However, the current demand for salted fish is driven more by the flavour of the product than for preservation purposes. Vacuum-packaging represents a static form of hypobaric storage. It is widely used in the food industry because of its effectiveness in reducing oxidative reactions in the product at relatively low cost. Low temperature storage is one of the primary methods to maintain fish quality, based on the reduction in the rates of microbiological, chemical and biochemical changes. Material&nbsp; and methods. Fresh Golden mullets were rapidly beheaded, scaled, gutted and immediately washed with tap water then, samples were taken to the laboratory in ice box for chemical and microbial analysis of fresh fish, other samples were put in the brine (6 liter water and 2160 g salt was used for brine solution). After 14 days of brining, fish were taken out of brine solution and drained, then they were Vacuum Packed and labelled (each pack contained two fish about 1500 g weight). All the packs were stored in a refrigerator 4 &deg;C. Some quality aspects including Total Volatile <b>Nitrogen</b> (TVN), <b>Peroxide</b> Value (PV), Thiobarbituric Acid (TBA), Total Viable Count (TVC), Halophilic Bacteria (HB) and presence of Clostridium Botulinum were determined in fresh mullets, fresh brined mullets after 14 days of brining, and in (Vacuum Packed) VP samples stored at 4 &deg;C at intervals of 30, 60 and 90 days. Results. &nbsp; TVN increased from ten mg/ 100 g in fresh brined after 14 days to 30. 80 mg/ 100 g in VP brined Golden mullet after 90 days of storage at 4 &deg;C, PV increased after brining from 1. 50 meq/kg in fresh brined to 28. 90 meq/kg in VP brined Golden mullet after 90 days of storage at 4 &deg;C, TBA increased from 0. 07 mg MDA/kg in fresh brined to 0. 10 after 60 days and then, decreased to 0. 09 mg MDA/kg in VP brined Golden mullet after 90 days of storage and&nbsp; TVC decreased from 4. 70 log CFU/gr in fresh brined to 4. 40 log CFU/ gr after 30 days and then, increased to 5. 70 log CFU/gr in VP brined Golden mullet after 90 days of storage at 4 &deg;C, HB increased from 4. 55 log CFU/gr in fresh brined to 6. 30 log CFU/gr after 90 days of storage period at 4 &deg;C and exceeded the permissible level. Clostridium botulinum toxin was not detected in any of the samples throughout the storage. Conclusions. The results from this study clearly suggested that a combination of brining, vacuum packaging and storage at refrigerated temperature prolongs the shelf-life of Golden mullet to a great extent. Our findings revealed that the longest shelf-life was for VP brined Golden mullet stored at 4 &deg;C is 30 days...|$|R
