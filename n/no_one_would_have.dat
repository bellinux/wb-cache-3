5|$|The opening was a placid Nimzo-Indian Defence, {{and after}} 17...Ba4 {{the game was}} even (Filip). After a series of piece exchanges the {{position}} in the diagram was reached after 29.b5.

5|$|There {{was also}} much {{speculation}} {{at the time}} in the Adelaide and Melbourne press on why the lifeboats had not been launched earlier. Survivor James Fitzgerald pointed out in his recollection that, had the lifeboats been filled to capacity, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> survived the severe weather conditions experienced. He also commented that passenger vessels were not required to carry enough lifeboats, concluding that there were insufficient places for all Gothenburgs passengers and crew. It was not until RMS Titanic sank some 37 years later in 1912, that it was made compulsory for all British registered ships to carry sufficient lifeboats for everyone on board.|$|E
5|$|The design {{specifications}} were completed in February 1945, and contracts were let {{to build the}} components. Three different plants were used so that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{a copy of the}} complete design. The gun and breech were made by the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C.; the target case and some other components were by the Naval Ordnance Plant in Center Line, Michigan; and the tail fairing and mounting brackets by the Expert Tool and Die Company in Detroit, Michigan. The bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945. The uranium-235 projectile was completed on 15 June, and the target on 24 July. The target and bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the fissile components) left Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, California, on 16 July aboard the heavy cruiser , arriving on 26 July. The target inserts followed by air on 30 July.|$|E

Certainly, the additions of Hans-Peter Briegel in midfield and of Danish striker Preben Elkjær to an attack that already featured the wing play of Pietro Fanna, the creative abilities of Antonio Di Gennaro and the scoring touch of Giuseppe Galderisi were to prove crucial.|$|E
25|$|The French {{ambassador}} to the United States registered {{a complaint with the}} President of the United States that Argonaut, by entering Lynnhaven bay, either before she captured Esperance or shortly thereafter, had violated a treaty between France and the United States. The French also accused the British of having brought Esperance into Lynnhaven for refitting for a cruise. The President passed the complaint to the Secretary of State, who forwarded the complaint to the Governor of Virginia. The Governor inquired into the matter of the British Consul at Virginia. The British Consul replied that the capture had taken place some 10 leagues off shore. The weather had forced Argonaut and her prize to shelter within the Chesapeake for some days, but that they had left as soon as practicable. Furthermore, Argonaut had paroled her French prisoners when she came into Lynnhaven and if had entered American territorial waters solely to parole her French prisoners <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> thought that objectionable. The authorities in Virginia took a number of depositions but ultimately nothing further came from the matter.|$|E
500|$|Avellone {{remarked that}} many of the ideas in the game [...] "could only have been communicated through text, simply because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> the budget or {{resources}} to fully realise many of these fantasy works through TV or movies". Ultimately, Avellone has expressed some regret about the game's heavy focus on dialogue, as he feels this interfered with the overall game mechanics, particularly the combat system. The game's script contains around 800,000 words, after early previews had indicated that the game would be only about 20 hours long.|$|E

500|$|Little Boy was {{developed}} by Lieutenant Commander Francis Birch's group of Captain William S. Parsons's Ordnance (O) Division at the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II. Parsons flew on the Hiroshima mission as weaponeer. The Little Boy was a development of the unsuccessful Thin Man nuclear bomb. Like Thin Man, it was a gun-type fission weapon, but derived its explosive power from the nuclear fission of uranium-235, whereas Thin Man was based on fission of plutonium-239. Fission was accomplished by shooting a hollow cylinder of enriched uranium (the [...] "bullet") onto a solid cylinder of the same material (the [...] "target") {{by means of a}} charge of nitrocellulose propellant powder. It contained [...] of enriched uranium, of which less than a kilogram underwent nuclear fission. Its components were fabricated at three different plants so that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a copy of the complete design.|$|E

500|$|In 1977, Daniel arrives back on {{the island}} and sets out to stop the {{construction}} of the Swan Station before drilling hits the electromagnetic [...] "energy pocket", which ultimately results in the crash of Flight 815. Faraday plans to detonate the hydrogen bomb [...] "Jughead" [...] and destroy the unstable electromagnetic energy so <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to be pushing a button to save the world and Flight 815 would not crash. Before putting his plan into action, Daniel visits a young Charlotte, telling her never to return to the island once she leaves. Daniel then travels to the Others' camp with Jack and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) to obtain the bomb. He breaks into their camp and threatens to shoot Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell). However, he is shot by his mother, Eloise Hawking. Before Daniel dies, he tells Eloise he is her son and she sent him to the island despite knowing he would die.|$|E
500|$|In Britain, press {{reaction}} to Amundsen's victory was restrained but generally positive. Apart from the enthusiastic {{reports in the}} Daily Chronicle and the Illustrated London News—which each had a financial stake in Amundsen's success—the Manchester Guardian remarked that any cause for reproach was wiped out by the Norwegians' courage and determination. Readers of Young England were exhorted not to grudge [...] "the brave Norseman" [...] the honour he had earned, and The Boy's Own Paper suggested that every British boy should read Amundsen's expedition account. The Times correspondent offered a mild rebuke to Amundsen for his failure to inform Scott {{until it was too}} late for the latter to respond, [...] "all the more unnecessary, for <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> welcomed co-operation in the work of South Polar exploration more than Captain Scott... Still, no one who knows Captain Amundsen can have any doubt of his integrity, and since he states he has reached the Pole we are bound to believe him".|$|E
500|$|The {{first result}} {{had already been}} {{determined}} by G. Bauer in 1859. The second was new to Hardy, and was derived from a class of functions called hypergeometric series, which had first been researched by Leonhard Euler and Carl Friedrich Gauss. Hardy found these results [...] "much more intriguing" [...] than Gauss's work on integrals. After seeing Ramanujan's theorems on continued fractions on the last page of the manuscripts, Hardy commented that the theorems [...] "defeated me completely; I {{had never seen anything}} in the least like them before". He figured that Ramanujan's theorems [...] "must be true, because, if they were not true, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> the imagination to invent them". Hardy asked a colleague, J. E. Littlewood, {{to take a look at}} the papers. Littlewood was amazed by Ramanujan's genius. After discussing the papers with Littlewood, Hardy concluded that the letters were [...] "certainly the most remarkable I have received" [...] and said that Ramanujan was [...] "a mathematician of the highest quality, a man of altogether exceptional originality and power". One colleague, E. H. Neville, later remarked that [...] "not one [...] could have been set in the most advanced mathematical examination in the world".|$|E

500|$|Two {{types of}} gun design were produced: Type A was of high alloy steel, and Type B of more {{ordinary}} steel. Type B {{was chosen for}} production because it was lighter. The primers and propellant {{were the same as}} those previously chosen for Thin Man. Scale test firing of the hollow projectile and target insert was conducted with the 3-inch/50 caliber gun and a [...] Hispano cannon. Starting in December, test firing was done full-scale. Amazingly, the first test case produced {{turned out to be the}} best ever made. It was used in four test firings at the Anchor Ranch, and ultimately in the Little Boy used in the bombing of Hiroshima. The design specifications were completed in February 1945, and contracts were let to build the components. Three different plants were used so that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a copy of the complete design.

500|$|Twilight was in {{development}} for approximately {{three years at}} Paramount Pictures's MTV Films, during which time a screen adaptation differing significantly from the novel was written. For example, the script transformed Bella into a star athlete. Stephenie Meyer stated {{that there was some}} debate in allowing the movie to be made because of the negative or positive outcome of the movie compared to the book, '"They could have put that [...] movie out, called it something else, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> known it was Twilight!" [...] The idea of seeing a scene converted correctly, specifically the meadow scene, convinced Meyer to sell the rights. In seeing the script, she was frightened that she had made the wrong decision. When Summit Entertainment reinvented itself as a full-service studio in April 2007, it successfully acquired the rights to the novel. Erik Feig, President of Production at Summit Entertainment, guaranteed a close adaptation to the book. The company perceived the film as an opportunity to launch a franchise based on the success of Meyer's book and its sequels. Meyer felt that Summit was open to letting her {{be a part of the}} film. Catherine Hardwicke was hired to direct the film, and soon afterward, Melissa Rosenberg was selected to be the film's structural base as the writer of the film.|$|E
500|$|With the {{loosening}} {{of industry}} censorship constraints, the 1960s saw a major {{expansion in the}} commercial viability {{of a variety of}} B movie subgenres that became known collectively as exploitation films. The combination of intensive and gimmick-laden publicity with movies featuring vulgar subject matter and often outrageous imagery dated back decades—the term had originally defined truly fringe productions, made at the lowest depths of Poverty Row or entirely outside the Hollywood system. Many graphically depicted the wages of sin in the context of promoting prudent lifestyle choices, particularly [...] "sexual hygiene". Audiences might see explicit footage of anything from a live birth to a ritual circumcision. Such films were not generally booked as part of movie theaters' regular schedules but rather presented as special events by traveling roadshow promoters (they might also appear as fodder for [...] "grindhouses", which typically had no regular schedule at all). The most famous of those promoters, Kroger Babb, was in the vanguard of marketing low-budget, sensationalistic films with a [...] "100% saturation campaign", inundating the target audience with ads in almost any imaginable medium. In the era of the traditional double feature, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> characterized these graphic exploitation films as [...] "B movies". With the majors having exited traditional B production and exploitation-style promotion becoming standard practice {{at the lower end of}} the industry, [...] "exploitation" [...] became a way to refer to the entire field of low-budget genre films. The 1960s would see exploitation-style themes and imagery become increasingly central to the realm of the B.|$|E
