40|$|Abstract: The {{measure of}} {{performance}} of any water utility {{is based on}} the efficiency of the water distribution systems in place. Lately, performance indicators and benchmarking methodologies are the most important approaches used in assessing water distribution systems efficiency. This paper reviews water distribution systems assessment indictors and assesses their application to developing countries. The main indicators in use world over are either financial or operational. It was discovered that many utilities in developing countries do not adequately use these assessment indicators in their water loss management strategies. In a case study of the City of Harare, Zimbabwe, it was established that the city has 53 % <b>Non</b> <b>Revenue</b> Water Management systems efficiency after applying <b>non</b> <b>revenue</b> water assessment indicators...|$|R

40|$|Many reasons {{have been}} {{identified}} as contributing to or causing high level of non-revenue water such as poor organizational structures in the responsible agency, insufficient funds, poor water network implementation and low profile of actions addressing optimization of services including leakage control, inadequate tariff and collection systems. This paper describes a simulation system that was developed to predict the supply and demand of treated water as well as <b>non</b> <b>revenue</b> water source and magnitude for a case study of a public treated water distribution system. The system can also be used in assisting the management of the water department in simulating future development such as demand and new construction of water distribution. In conclusion, the developed system has increased the knowledge of the distribution system and understanding of consumption patterns and <b>non</b> <b>revenue</b> water zones, which has allowed the water authority to optimize its distribution system. 1...|$|R
