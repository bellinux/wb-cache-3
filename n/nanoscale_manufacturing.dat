40|$|Wear of sliding {{contacts}} leads to energy dissipation and device failure, resulting in massive {{economic and environmental}} costs. Typically, wear phenomena are described empirically, because physical and chemical interactions at sliding interfaces are not fully understood at any length scale. Fundamental insights from individual nanoscale contacts are crucial for understanding wear at larger length scales, and to enable reliable <b>nanoscale</b> devices, <b>manufacturing</b> and microscopy. Observable nanoscale wear mechanisms include fracture and plastic deformation, but recent experiments and models propose another mechanism: wear via atom-by-atom removal ('atomic attrition'), which can be modelled using stress-assisted chemical reaction kinetics. Experimental evidence for this {{has so far been}} inferential. Here, we quantitatively measure the wear of silicon-a material relevant to small-scale devices-using in situ transmission electron microscopy. We resolve worn volumes as small as 25 ± 5 nm 3, a factor of 10 3 lower than is achievable using alternative techniques. Wear of silicon against diamond is consistent with atomic attrition, and inconsistent with fracture or plastic deformation, as shown using direct imaging. The rate of atom removal depends exponentially on stress in the contact, as predicted by chemical rate kinetics. Measured activation parameters are consistent with an atom-by-atom process. These results, by direct observation, establish atomic attrition as the primary wear mechanism of silicon in vacuum at low loads. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved...|$|R

However, manufacturing and layout constraints, {{as well as}} high defect/fault rates expected in nanoscale fabrics, could make most device density lost when integrated into computing systems. Therefore, a nanoscale architecture that can deal with those constraints and tolerate defects/faults at expected rates, while still retaining the density advantage, is highly desirable.

Towards this goal, an efficient statistical algorithm is derived to efficiently estimate the information density and then optimize the memory system for maximum-information storage. Our experimental results demonstrate that with a traditional 6 -T SRAM cell designed in a commercial 45 nm CMOS process, the proposed MIMS design can successfully operate at an extremely low power supply voltage (i. e., 0. 6 V) and improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by more than 20 dB compared to the traditional SRAM design...|$|E

Most conventional defect/fault-tolerance techniques are not suitable in nanoscale designs because they are designed for very small defect rates and assume arbitrary layouts for required circuits.
