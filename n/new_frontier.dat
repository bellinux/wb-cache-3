5|$|In 121 BC, Han forces {{expelled}} the Xiongnu from a vast territory {{spanning the}} Hexi Corridor to Lop Nur. They repelled a joint Xiongnu-Qiang invasion of this northwestern territory in 111 BC. In that year, the Han court established four <b>new</b> <b>frontier</b> commanderies in this region: Jiuquan, Zhangyi, Dunhuang, and Wuwei. The {{majority of people}} on the frontier were soldiers. On occasion, the court forcibly moved peasant farmers to <b>new</b> <b>frontier</b> settlements, along with government-owned slaves and convicts who performed hard labor. The court also encouraged commoners, such as farmers, merchants, landowners, and hired laborers, to voluntarily migrate to the frontier.|$|E
5|$|Since its founding, {{ethnic groups}} in the city have {{clustered}} in enclaves in north, south and downtown Omaha. In its early days, the sometimes lawless nature of a <b>new</b> <b>frontier</b> city included crime, such as illicit gambling and riots.|$|E
5|$|Before {{arriving}} in the WWF, Jeff and Matt formed their own wrestling promotion, the Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (OMEGA) with Thomas Simpson. The promotion was a more successful version of the original TWF and included talent such as both Hardy brothers, Shannon Moore, Gregory Helms, Joey Matthews, and Steve Corino, among others. In OMEGA, each of the brothers portrayed several different characters; Hardy portrayed such characters as Willow the Wisp, Iceman, Mean Jimmy Jack Tomkins, and The Masked Mountain. While there, Hardy held the <b>New</b> <b>Frontier</b> Championship as a singles competitor and the Tag Team Championship with Matt. The promotion folded in April 1998 when they signed contracts with the WWF.|$|E
50|$|The mission had {{previously}} been referred to by the backronym Jupiter Near-polar Orbiter. Juno is sometimes called <b>New</b> <b>Frontiers</b> 2 as the second mission in the <b>New</b> <b>Frontiers</b> program, but {{is not to be}} confused with New Horizons 2, a proposed but unselected <b>New</b> <b>Frontiers</b> mission.|$|R
40|$|NASA has {{initiated}} two missions in the <b>New</b> <b>Frontiers</b> Program {{and plans to}} issue an announcement of opportunity in 2008 to enable teams led by a principal investigator {{to compete for the}} third <b>New</b> <b>Frontiers</b> mission. NASA has asked the National Research Council to provide criteria and guiding principles for determining the list of candidate missions for this new competition. The <b>New</b> <b>Frontiers</b> Program was established at the recommendation of the 2003 National Research Council solar system exploration decadal survey, <b>New</b> <b>Frontiers</b> in the Solar System: An Integrated Exploration Strategy. 1 The decadal survey recommended five medium-size missions as options for the <b>New</b> <b>Frontiers</b> Program. Three of those options remain to be implemented. In addition, the decadal survey listed five other medium-size missions that it did not specifically recommend for implementation. The Committee on New Opportunities in Solar System Exploration has sought to follow the guidance of the decadal survey in recommending principles for the next <b>New</b> <b>Frontiers</b> competition...|$|R

5|$|Constantine {{considered}} Constantinople his {{capital and}} permanent residence. He {{lived there for}} {{a good portion of}} his later life. In 328 the emperor Constantine the Great inaugurated the Constantine's Bridge (Danube) at Sucidava, (today Celei in Romania) in hopes of reconquering Dacia, a province that had been abandoned under Aurelian. In the late winter of 332, Constantine campaigned with the Sarmatians against the Goths. The weather and lack of food cost the Goths dearly: reportedly, nearly one hundred thousand died before they submitted to Rome. In 334, after Sarmatian commoners had overthrown their leaders, Constantine led a campaign against the tribe. He won a victory in the war and extended his control over the region, as remains of camps and fortifications in the region indicate. Constantine resettled some Sarmatian exiles as farmers in Illyrian and Roman districts, and conscripted the rest into the army. The <b>new</b> <b>frontier</b> in Dacia was along the Brazda lui Novac line supported by new castra. Constantine took the title Dacicus maximus in 336.|$|E
5|$|Hardy, {{along with}} his brother Jeff and friends, started their own federation, the Trampoline Wrestling Federation (TWF) and mimicked the moves they saw on television. Shortly after Hardy sent in a tape for the World Championship Wrestling (WCW) Amateur Challenge using the ring name High Voltage, a tag team named High Voltage began {{competing}} in WCW, causing Hardy to change his name to Surge. A few years later, it was revealed to him by Chris Kanyon that the tape had been kept in the WCW Power Plant, watched multiple times, and that the name High Voltage was blatantly stolen from it. Beginning in 1994, The Hardys wrestled for several North Carolina-based independent circuit promotions and adapted a number of alter-egos. As The Wolverine, Hardy captured the New England Wrestling Alliance (NEWA) Championship in May 1994. As High Voltage, he teamed with Venom to claim the <b>New</b> <b>Frontier</b> Wrestling Association (NFWA) Tag Team Championship in March 1995. A month later, High Voltage defeated the Willow for the NFWA Championship.|$|E
5|$|In reality, the campaign's {{military}} {{impact on}} Byzantium was limited: outside the garrison and population of Amorium itself, the Byzantine field army at Anzen {{seems to have}} suffered few casualties, and the revolt of the Khurramite corps was suppressed without bloodshed {{the next year and}} its soldiers reintegrated into the Byzantine army. Ancyra was quickly rebuilt and reoccupied, as was Amorium itself, although it never recovered its former glory and the seat of the Anatolic theme was for a time transferred to Polybotus. According to the assessment of Warren Treadgold, the imperial army's defeats at Anzen and Amorium were to a large degree the result of circumstance rather than actual incapability or inadequacy. In addition, the Byzantine campaign had suffered from Theophilos's overconfidence, both in his willingness to divide his forces in the face of greater Arab numbers and in his over-reliance on the Khurramites. Nevertheless, the defeat prompted Theophilos to undertake a major reorganization of his army, which included the establishment of <b>new</b> <b>frontier</b> commands and the dispersing of the Khurramite troops among the native troops of the themes.|$|E

5|$|Khonsari first {{discussed}} {{the game in}} February 2011, announcing it as 1979: The Game. It was initially intended to be episodic, consisting of three or nine episodes, but was later reduced to one game. A crowdfunding campaign for the game was launched on Kickstarter in 2013 with a goal of US$395,000, but failed to reach its goal, {{with a total of}} US$304,741 raised. Additional fundraising was set up on the game's website. Following the failed campaign, the team partnered with the <b>New</b> <b>Frontier</b> Story Lab at Sundance in 2014 and 2015, the Museum of the Moving Image in New York, and the Doris Duke Foundation. 1979 Revolution was approved through Steam Greenlight in July 2015, and was released for Microsoft Windows and OS X on April 5, 2016, for iOS devices on June 10, 2016, and for Android devices on December 14, 2016; console versions are also in development. The game is also planned to have Oculus Rift support; the team rewrote one of the interrogation scenes to fit with the experience. 1979 Revolution runs on the Unity game engine. Khonsari has expressed interest in a sequel, stating that it depends on the commercial success of the first game. He is also interested in developing additional games about other historical events.|$|E
