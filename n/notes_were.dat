5|$|The unmarked {{bills from}} the robbery {{were easy to}} exchange, but the serial numbers of the 500-ruble <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> known to the authorities, making them {{impossible}} to exchange in Russian banks. By the end of 1907, Lenin decided to exchange the remaining 500-ruble notes abroad. Krasin had his forger try to change some of the serial numbers. Two hundred of these <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> transported abroad by Martyn Lyadov (they were sewn into his vest by the wives of Lenin and Bogdanov at Lenin's headquarters in Kuokkala). Lenin's plan was to have various individuals exchange the stolen 500-ruble notes simultaneously {{at a number of}} banks throughout Europe. Zhitomirsky heard of the plan and reported it to the Okhrana, who contacted police departments throughout Europe asking them to arrest anyone who tried to cash the notes.|$|E
5|$|US$10 {{million worth}} of Zimbabwean Bond <b>Notes</b> <b>were</b> {{introduced}} in November 2016 and were denominated in U.S. dollars. They circulated along with eight other currencies, but {{could not be used}} outside of Zimbabwe. Withdrawals from Zimbabwean bank accounts were issued in bond notes.|$|E
5|$|A new remastered and {{expanded}} version of Live And Dangerous {{was released in}} 2011. As well as the full album, remastered by Andy Pearce and Matt Wortham, it featured two additional tracks that were not used, and a DVD with the Rainbow Theatre footage. The sleeve <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> written by Malcolm Dome and included a debate of exactly {{how much of the}} album was live, and what was overdubbed.|$|E
5000|$|A new 1 rial <b>note</b> <b>is</b> now in {{circulation}} alongside the 1970 <b>note</b> which <b>is</b> still accepted. The new 1 rial <b>note</b> <b>is</b> red, {{similar to the}} 5 rial note. A new Blue 20 rial <b>note</b> <b>was</b> issued in 2010 {{on the occasion of}} the 40th National Day. Both the old and the new <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> accepted. The 200 baisa <b>note</b> <b>is</b> now out of circulation.|$|R
50|$|Its top <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> pink grapefruit, wild berries & redcurrants. mid <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> Fresh Freesia, Jasmine Petals & Frangipani. The dry <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> Creamy Musk, Sheer Woods & White Patchouli.|$|R
2500|$|... 1862: The first $100 United States <b>Note</b> <b>was</b> issued. Variations of this <b>note</b> <b>were</b> issued that {{resulted}} in slightly different wording (obligations) on the reverse; the <b>note</b> <b>was</b> issued again in Series of 1863.|$|R
5|$|As Secretary of Administration and Finance, Baker was a main {{architect}} of the Big Dig financing plan. In 1997 {{the federal government was}} planning to cut funding for the Big Dig by $300 million per year. The state set up a trust and sold Grant Anticipation Notes (GANs) to investors. The <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> secured by promising future federal highway funds. As federal highway dollars are awarded to Massachusetts, the money is used to pay off the GANs.|$|E
5|$|Fractional currency, also {{referred}} to as shinplasters, was introduced by the United States federal government following the outbreak of the Civil War. These fractional <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> in use between 21 August 1862 and 15 February 1876, and issued in 3, 5, 10, 15, 25, and 50 cent denominations across five issuing periods. The complete type set below is part of the National Numismatic Collection, housed at the National Museum of American History, part of the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|Six {{defendants}} were then charged with stealing from George Stevens in Ely. Three witness were examined following which Dennis, Layton, Atkin, and Cammell were all pronounced guilty by the jury. Capital convictions against Aaron Chevall and William Beamiss, for robbing Henry Tansley of two £1 <b>notes,</b> <b>were</b> also returned by the jury. The court adjourned at 6pm.|$|E
50|$|Used bank <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> less {{desired by}} {{collectors}} {{in comparison to}} uncirculated bank notes. However, many old, rare bank <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> valuable to collectors when uncirculated <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> not available at an affordable price.|$|R
5000|$|... 1862: The first $100 United States <b>Note</b> <b>was</b> issued. Variations of this <b>note</b> <b>were</b> issued that {{resulted}} in slightly different wording (obligations) on the reverse; the <b>note</b> <b>was</b> issued again in Series of 1863.|$|R
50|$|Musical {{terminology}} {{also uses}} inclusive counting of intervals between {{notes of the}} standard scale: going up one <b>note</b> <b>is</b> a second interval, going up two <b>notes</b> <b>is</b> a third interval, etc., and going up seven <b>notes</b> <b>is</b> an octave.|$|R
5|$|The Daily Express ran {{the story}} on 1 October 1994. They {{reported}} that charred £50 <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> being found by islanders, who did not doubt the burning had really taken place. Drummond and Cauty had been seen eating in a hotel bar on Jura before leaving with two suitcases, the newspaper reported.|$|E
5|$|The Tilhas Tizig Gesheften, a {{small group}} formed from the British Army's Jewish Brigade, {{obtained}} a supply of counterfeit pounds from Jaacov Levy, one of Schwend's money-laundering agents. The forged <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> used to buy equipment and to bring displaced persons to Palestine, {{in defiance of the}} British blockade of the territory.|$|E
5|$|The <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> {{handed to}} two {{horsemen}} who were standing by. The Manchester and Salford Yeomanry were stationed {{just a short}} distance away in Portland Street, and so received their note first. They immediately drew their swords and galloped towards St Peter's Field. One trooper, in a frantic attempt to catch up, knocked down a woman in Cooper Street, causing the death of her son when he was thrown from her arms; two-year-old William Fildes was the first casualty of Peterloo.|$|E
50|$|If {{the melody}} <b>note</b> <b>is</b> {{part of the}} chord, the harmony <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> also taken from the chord.|$|R
50|$|The Bank of England £1 <b>note</b> <b>was</b> a {{banknote}} of {{the pound}} sterling. After the ten shilling <b>note</b> <b>was</b> withdrawn in 1970 {{it became the}} smallest denomination note issued by the Bank of England. The one pound <b>note</b> <b>was</b> issued by the Bank of England {{for the first time}} in 1797 and continued to be printed until 1984. The <b>note</b> <b>was</b> withdrawn in 1988 in favour of the one pound coin.|$|R
25|$|When two <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> {{one above}} the other, {{as in the}} podatus, the lower <b>note</b> <b>is</b> always sung first.|$|R
5|$|Another {{factor in}} the Mellotron's sound is that the {{individual}} <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> recorded in isolation. For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, and meant that they had nothing against which to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kirby refused to downtune his cello to cover the lower range of the Mellotron, and so the bottom notes are actually performed on a double bass. According to Mellotron author Nick Awde, one note of the string sounds contains {{the sound of a}} chair being scraped in the background.|$|E
5|$|Committed to {{national}} cultural preservation and expansion, Massaquoi {{served as the}} director, later dean, of the Liberal Arts College and was the founding director of the Institute of African Studies. She co-founded the Society of Liberian Authors, helped abolish the practice of usurping African names for Westernized versions, and worked towards standardization of the Vai script. In the late 1960s, Vivian Seton, Massaquoi's daughter, had the autobiographical manuscript microfilmed for preservation. After Massaquoi's death, her writings and <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> rediscovered, edited and published in 2013 as The Autobiography of an African Princess.|$|E
5|$|Each {{section of}} the process was overseen {{by one of the}} prisoners, and the day-to-day {{operations}} were run by Oscar Stein, a former office manager and bookkeeper. Two twelve-hour shifts ensured non-stop production, with around 140 prisoners working. The printed sheets, each containing four <b>notes,</b> <b>were</b> dried and cropped using a steel ruler; the edges were roughened to imitate the deckle finish of the British notes. The operation peaked between mid-1943 and mid-1944, with approximately 65,000 notes a month produced from six flat-bed printing presses.|$|E
5|$|Heat Seduction was {{released}} in August 2016, after Heat Kissed. It is packaged in a golden bottle. The top <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> of spices mandarin, dewberry. The middle <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> of ginger orchid, African jungle orchid, freesia. And the base <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> of amber, musk and labdanum.|$|R
5000|$|Ease of Trading: Trading through {{participatory}} <b>notes</b> <b>is</b> {{easy because}} participatory <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> like contract <b>notes</b> transferable by endorsement and delivery.|$|R
40|$|These <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> an {{introduction}} to the theory of abelian varieties, including the arithmetic of abelian varieties and Faltings’s proof of certain finiteness theorems. The orginal version of the <b>notes</b> <b>was</b> distributed during the teaching of an advanced graduate course. Alas, the <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> still in very rough form...|$|R
5|$|Hammond console organs {{come with}} a wooden pedalboard played with the feet, for bass notes. Most console Hammond pedalboards have 25 notes, with the bottom note a low C and the top note a middle C two octaves higher. Hammond used a 25-note pedalboard because he found that on {{traditional}} 32-note pedalboards used in church pipe organs, the top seven <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> seldom used. The Hammond Concert models E, RT, RT-2, RT-3 and D-100 had 32-note American Guild of Organists (AGO) pedalboards {{going up to the}} G above middle C as the top note. The RT-2, RT-3 and D-100 also contained a separate solo pedal system that had its own volume control and various other features. Spinet models have 12- or 13-note miniature pedalboards.|$|E
5|$|Harper {{noticed that}} Bartram's <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> {{considerably}} altered and expanded in the printed edition, and the {{detail of the}} white tail appeared in print {{for the first time}} in this revised account. Harper believed that Bartram could have tried to fill in details of the bird from memory and got the tail coloration wrong. Harper and several other researchers have attempted to prove the former existence of a king vulture relative in Florida at this late date, suggesting that the population was in the process of extinction and finally disappeared during a cold spell. Additionally, William McAtee, noting the tendency of birds to form Floridian subspecies, suggested that the white tail could be a sign that the painted vulture was a subspecies of the king vulture.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008, Speight found Collins's body in {{the bath}} of their shared London flat. He was arrested on {{suspicion}} of her murder, but not charged with any offence. An inquest later determined that Collins {{had died of a}} drug overdose and severe burns from hot water. In April that year, Speight was reported missing and was later discovered to have taken his own life by hanging himself near Paddington station. Two suicide <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> discovered, describing how he could no longer live without Collins.|$|E
50|$|In this example, natural <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> {{sharpened}} by multiplying its {{frequency ratio}} by 256:243 (called a limma), and a natural <b>note</b> <b>is</b> flattened by multiplying its ratio by 243:256. A pair of enharmonic <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> {{separated by a}} Pythagorean comma, which is equal to 531441:524288 (about 23.46 cents).|$|R
30|$|The {{encoding}} strategy {{followed for}} a pitched music note and an unpitched <b>note</b> <b>is</b> different. The encoding logic for an unpitched <b>note</b> <b>is</b> straightforward like a singleton entity. But a pitched <b>note</b> <b>is</b> {{regarded as a}} grouped entity and we use priority-based encoding for this set as illustrated in Fig.  6.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} audio files play various intervals. In {{each case}} the first <b>note</b> played <b>is</b> middle C. The next <b>note</b> <b>is</b> sharper than C by the assigned value in cents. Finally, the two <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> played simultaneously.|$|R
5|$|In {{parallel}} with the second investigation, a case was being prepared against Det Ch Supt Melvin and Det Insp Dingle. In July 1992 Melvin was charged with perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, and Dingle with conspiracy. In 1994 their lawyers applied for access to information from Nove's inquiry, {{on the grounds that}} it might help their clients; anything that implicated Winston Silcott would support the detectives' contention that their interview <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> genuine and that Silcott really had, in effect, confessed. The lawyers also argued that the detectives should not be prosecuted until all related criminal proceedings had concluded.|$|E
5|$|On 31 March 2003, the BCCS {{merged with}} the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which took over the {{responsibility}} of banknote issuance. On 4 May 2004, the MAS started issuing polymer versions of the S$10 note for general circulation; polymer versions of the S$2 and S$5 <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> subsequently released. Higher denomination banknotes (S$50, S$100, S$1,000 & S$10,000) are still printed on paper. The paper version of the lower denomination banknotes remain in active circulation alongside the polymer version, though the number of S$2 and S$5 paper notes have dwindled significantly since the introduction of polymer notes.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 {{banknote}} series was {{prepared by the}} Reserve Bank in October 2006 for the abandoned second phase of Operation Sunrise. The Chiremba Balancing Rocks was to be reinstated as the main feature on the obverse whilst use of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark continued. There were additional security features as opposed to previous issues, which included security threads, see-through register marks and recognition marks for the partially sighted. Holographic security threads and Optically Variable Ink were used on the $100, $500 and $1000 notes. When the redenomination of 1 August 2008 occurred these <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> put into circulation as banknotes of the third dollar between 1 August 2008 to 31 December 2008.|$|E
50|$|According to Indian law, {{possessing}} fake <b>notes</b> <b>is</b> a punishable offence, {{but only}} if the person in question is aware that the <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> fake.|$|R
50|$|Transpositionally {{symmetrical}} sets either {{divide the}} octave evenly, {{or can be}} written as the union of equally sized sets that themselves divide the octave evenly. Inversionally symmetrical chords are invariant under reflections in pitch class space. This means that the chords can be ordered cyclically so that the series of intervals between successive <b>notes</b> <b>is</b> the same read forward or backward. For instance, in the cyclical ordering (0, 1, 2, 7), the interval {{between the first and}} second <b>note</b> <b>is</b> 1, the interval between the second and third <b>note</b> <b>is</b> 1, the interval between the third and fourth <b>note</b> <b>is</b> 5, and the interval between the fourth note and the first <b>note</b> <b>is</b> 5.|$|R
25|$|The last issued 10,000 {{shilling}} <b>note</b> <b>was</b> dated 1 August 1951 but {{the high}} denomination <b>note</b> <b>was</b> used for clearing internally for many years after 1951.|$|R
