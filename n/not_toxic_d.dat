50|$|Phosphates are <b>not</b> <b>toxic</b> {{to people}} or animals {{unless they are}} present in very high levels. Digestive {{problems}} could occur from extremely high levels of phosphate.|$|R
25|$|Most {{studies have}} shown that alloxan is <b>not</b> <b>toxic</b> to the human beta-cell, even in very high doses, {{probably}} because of differing glucose uptake mechanisms in humans and rodents.|$|R
50|$|Honey {{from its}} flowers is dark in colour, and {{apparently}} <b>not</b> <b>toxic</b> to humans. The flowers are visited by insects and birds, especially sunbirds which eagerly seek them out.|$|R
50|$|Oil bubblers {{are filled}} with mineral or {{silicone}} oil. These are both quite resistant to chemical attack. Oil bubblers are predominantly used; the oil is inexpensive and <b>not</b> <b>toxic.</b>|$|R
50|$|Two {{enantiomer}}s of pumiliotoxin 251D. On {{the left}} the plus enantiomer is shown which is toxic. On {{the right side}} the minus enantiomer, which is <b>not</b> <b>toxic,</b> is shown.|$|R
50|$|Some {{studies have}} shown that alloxan is <b>not</b> <b>toxic</b> to the human beta-cell, even in very high doses, {{probably}} because of differing glucose uptake mechanisms in humans and rodents.|$|R
5000|$|... pot curare (originally {{packed in}} terra cotta pots; main {{alkaloid}} components are protocurarine, protocurine, and protocuridine). Protocurarine is the active ingredient; protocurine is only weakly toxic, and protocuridine is <b>not</b> <b>toxic.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Currently, a {{human form}} of {{alfaxalone}} is in development {{under the name}} [...] "Phaxan": alfaxalone will be dissolved in 7-sulfo-butyl-ether-Î²-cyclodextrin, which, unlike the cyclodextrin used in Alfaxan, is <b>not</b> <b>toxic</b> to people.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the fact}} that it is {{prepared}} from cyanide salts, Prussian blue is <b>not</b> <b>toxic</b> because the cyanide groups are tightly bound to iron. Other polymeric cyanometalates are similarly stable with low toxicity.|$|R
25|$|Healthy urine is <b>not</b> <b>toxic.</b> However, it {{contains}} compounds eliminated {{by the body}} as undesirable, and can be irritating to skin and eyes. After suitable processing {{it is possible to}} extract potable water from urine.|$|R
50|$|Upper Limits (ULs) are for {{synthetic}} {{and natural}} retinol ester forms of vitamin A. Carotene forms from dietary sources are <b>not</b> <b>toxic</b> and are <b>not</b> added when calculating total vitamin A intake for safety purposes.|$|R
5000|$|While the {{floating}} material was <b>not</b> <b>toxic,</b> it was recommended that {{movement of the}} water surface be induced so that quiescent conditions would be avoided which would eliminate the primary condition for calcite raft formation.|$|R
40|$|A medium was {{developed}} for the more rapid culture of Pityrosporum ovale. [35 S]Methionine was utilized preferentially as sole sulphur source from which cysteine/cystine were synthesized. Growth was less on cysteine, negligible on cystine and nil on inorganic sulphite and sulphate. Selenium disulphide, amorphous sulphur, stable colloidal (red) selenium and selenourea were extremely toxic, entering the organism by diffusion. Tellurium and seleno-methionine entered the organism, the latter by active transport, but were <b>not</b> <b>toxic</b> for up to I week of incubation although synthesis of [75 Se]seleno-methionine was demonstrated. Selenite and metallic (black) selenium were <b>not</b> <b>toxic</b> and did <b>not</b> enter the organism. Possible mechanisms of toxicity are discussed...|$|R
25|$|Poorly {{tempered}} chocolate {{may have}} whitish {{spots on the}} dark chocolate part, called chocolate bloom; it {{is an indication that}} sugar and/or fat has separated due to poor storage. It is <b>not</b> <b>toxic</b> and can be safely consumed.|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{were carried}} out on Vegetable Oil Methyl Esters (VOME or FAME) {{answering}} the most recent specifications. The products tested are RME (Rapeseed oil Methyl Ester), ERME (Erucic Rapeseed oil Methyl Esters), SME (Sunflower oil Methyl Esters), and HOSME (High Oleic Sunflower oil Methyl Esters). They contain more than 99. 5 % of fatty acid mono esters. The compositions are given. VOME are not volatile {{and they are not}} easily flammable. They are not soluble in water and they are biodegradable. According to the methods implemented for the determination of the German classification of substances hazardous to waters WGK, they are <b>not</b> <b>toxic</b> on mammals and unlike diesel fuel they are <b>not</b> <b>toxic</b> on fish, daphnia, algae and bacteria. The RME is <b>not</b> either <b>toxic</b> for shrimps. According to tests on rabbits, RME and SME are not irritating for the skin and the eyes. VOME display particularly attractive environmental properties...|$|R
50|$|Phosphite is <b>not</b> <b>toxic</b> {{to people}} or animals. Its {{toxicity}} {{has been compared}} to that of table salt. Phosphite pose little environmental impact. When phosphite is sprayed on the foliage of plants, it is applied at a very low rate.|$|R
50|$|A study testing {{secondary}} metabolites {{obtained from}} Echinaster echinophorus found an extract from its tissues showed activity against Leishmania amazonensis, the protozoan parasite causing the tropical skin disease leishmaniasis, {{and it was}} <b>not</b> <b>toxic</b> to the mice on which it was tested.|$|R
50|$|Bactridines are toxins {{but they}} also inhibit the growth of bacteria. The fact that bactridine 1 is <b>not</b> <b>toxic</b> to mice and has no {{haemolytic}} effect on human erythrocytes seems to present some opportunities for therapeutic use {{in the form of}} antibiotics.|$|R
50|$|The {{biological}} function of TsPep2 {{is not clear}} yet, except from a small displacement on the 125I-KTX binding site on rat brain synaptosomes. However, {{it has been shown}} that this peptide is <b>not</b> <b>toxic</b> to mice. The LD50 of TsPep2 is currently unknown.|$|R
50|$|One new {{option that}} is under {{investigation}} for management potential is treating the seeds with silver nanoparticles.
