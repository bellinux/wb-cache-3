40|$|Background and Objectives - Sevoflurane is an inhalational {{anesthetic}} drug {{with low}} blood/gas solubility providing fast anesthesia induction and emergence. Its {{ability to maintain}} cardiovascular stability makes it ideal for pediatric anesthesia. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate hemodynamic stability, consumption of inhalational anesthetics and emergence time in children with and without premedication (midazolam or clonidine) anesthetized with sevoflurane titrated according to BIS monitoring. Methods - Participated in this study 30 patients aged 2 to 12 years, physical status ASA I, undergoing elective surgeries who were divided into 3 groups: G 1 - without premedication, G 2 - 0. 5 mg. kg- 1 oral midazolam, G 3 - 4 μg. kg- 1 oral clonidine 60 minutes before surgery. All patients received 30 μg. kg- 1 alfentanil, 3 mg. kg- 1 propofol, 0. 5 mg. kg- 1 atracurium, sevoflurane in different concentrations monitored by BIS (values close to 60) and N 2 O in a <b>non</b> <b>rebreathing</b> <b>system.</b> Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, expired sevoflurane concentration (EC), sevoflurane consumption (ml. min- 1) and emergence time were evaluated. Emergence time was defined as time elapsed between the end of anesthesia and patients' spontaneous movements trying to extubate themselves, crying and opening eyes and mouth. Results - There were no differences among groups as to systolic and diastolic blood pressure, EC, sevoflurane consumption and emergence time. Heart rate was lower in G 3 group. Conclusions - Sevoflurane has provided hemodynamic stability. Premedication with clonidine and midazolam did not influence emergence time, inhaled anesthetic consumption or maintenance of anesthesia with sevoflurane. Anesthesia duration has also not influenced emergence time. Hypnosis monitoring was important for balancing anesthetic levels and this might have been responsible for the similarity of emergence times for all studied groups...|$|E
40|$|A {{black box}} and a {{geometrical}} approach {{have been used}} to deduce the relationships between alveolar oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations when rebreathing occurs during the use of semi-closed anaesthetic <b>rebreathing</b> <b>systems.</b> Semi-closed <b>rebreathing</b> <b>systems</b> are popular for the administration of inhalation anaesthetic agents.

40|$|PURPOSE: To investigatge right-to-left shunt {{determination}} in dog lungs under inhalantion anesthesia with non-rebreathing and <b>rebreathing</b> <b>systems</b> and {{fraction of}} inspired oxygen (F I O 2) of 0. 9 and 0. 4, respectively. METHODS: Two groups of 10 dogs each under inhalation anesthesia with sevoflurane: GI {{in which it}} was utilized non-rebreathing semiclosed system and F I O 2 = 0. 9, and GII {{in which it was}} utilized <b>rebreathing</b> semiclosed <b>system</b> and F I O 2 = 0. 4. The study parameters were: heart rate, medium arterial pressure, right-to-left intrapulmonary shunt, hematocrit, hemoglobin, arterial partial pressure of oxygen, mixed venous partial pressure of oxygen, mixed venous oxygen saturation, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, partial pressure of water in the alveoli. RESULTS: Shunt results were significantly different between the two groups - GI data were higher than GII in all the evaluated moments. Hence, the group with nonrebreathing (GI) developed a superior grade of intrapulmonary shunt when compared with the rebreathing group (GII). The partial pressure of water in the alveoli was significantly higher in GII. CONCLUSION: The inhalation anesthesia with non-rebreathing system and F I O 2 = 0. 9 developed a higher grade of intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt when compared with the <b>rebreathing</b> <b>system</b> and F I O 2 = 0. 4.

40|$|The {{fraction}} of fresh gas flow useful for gas exchange during mechanically controlled venti-lation in partial <b>rebreathing</b> <b>systems</b> {{is equal to}} alveolar ventilation (Conway, 1976). This is, however, difficult to estimate in clinical practice. Non-alveolar rebreathing affects only deadspace and {{is not likely to}} affect end-tidal or arterial carbon dioxide tensions. If, on the other hand, alveolar rebreathing occurs, the end-tidal carbon dioxide tension increases. During mechanically controlled ventilation in T-piece systems the {{fraction of}} fresh gas flow that participates in gas exchange varies with minute ventilation (FE) and with fresh gas flow (FGF) (Nightingale, Richards and Glass, 1965; Conway, 1976; Rose and Froese, 1979). Froese and Rose (1982) made recommendations for FGF and VE designed to produce predictable arterial carbon dioxide tensions in children weighing between 10 and 30 kg. In order to evaluate the degree of alveolar rebreathing at different FGF in infants and young children ventilated in a partial <b>rebreathing</b> <b>system,</b> and to test the recommendations made by Froese and Rose (1982), inspired and end-tidal car-bon dioxide tensions were measured at different fresh gas flow settings and at various in-spiratory: expiratory (I:E) ratios.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Anesthetic {{clearance}} {{from the}} lungs and the circle <b>rebreathing</b> <b>system</b> can be maximized using hyperventilation and high fresh gas flows. However, the concomitant clearance of CO 2 decreases PAco 2, thereby decreasing {{cerebral blood flow}} and slowing the clearance of anesthetic from the brain. This study shows {{that in addition to}} hyperventilation, hypercapnia (CO 2 infusion or rebreathing) is a significant factor in decreasing emergence time from inhaled anesthesia. METHODS: We anesthetized seven pigs with 2 MAC PIG of isoflurane and four with 2 MAC PIG of sevoflurane. After 2 h, anesthesia was discontinued, and the animals were hyperventilated. The time to movement of multiple limbs was measured under hypocapnic (end-tidal CO 2 � 22 mm Hg) and hypercapnic (end-tidal CO 2 � 55 mm Hg) conditions. RESULTS: The time between turning off the vaporizer and to movement of multiple limbs was faster with hypercapnia during hyperventilation. Emergence time from isoflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia was shortened by an average of 65 % with rebreathing or {{with the use of a}} CO 2 controller (P � 0. 05) ...|$|R

A recently developed tool for determining cardiac output is the Innocor <b>rebreathing</b> <b>system,</b> which also incorporates an ergospirometry unit. So far, Innocor's test-retest reliability under exercise conditions {{has not been}} determined in healthy participants. Therefore, 15 male and 15 female healthy participants [30. 6 y (SD 4. 5); 68. 0 kg (SD 10. 5) ] performed 2 test sessions, each consisting of 2 graded exercise tests to volitional exhaustion. We determined intra- and inter-session reliability of cardiac output, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide output, and ventilation at 130 W and at peak exercise. For cardiac output, we found averaged coefficients of variation ranging from 4. 3 (intra-session, 130 W) to 10. 0 % (inter-session, rest). For oxygen consumption, coefficients of variation ranged from 3. 4 (intra-session, peak) to 5. 7 % (inter-session, peak). Coefficients of variation for carbon dioxide output were between 4. 4 (intra-session, peak) and 6. 6 % (inter-session, peak), and for ventilation between 5. 1 (intra-session, 130 W) and 7. 0 % (intra-session, peak). Innocor delivers safe and reliable measurements of cardiac output, gas exchange, and ventilation.

40|$|Abstract. The rate of {{endogenous}} {{carbon monoxide}} production (Vco), de-termined by the closed <b>rebreathing</b> <b>system</b> technique, was elevated above {{the normal range}} in four of five patients studied with ineffective erythropoiesis (four patients with primary refractory anemia, one with thalassemia). The mean molar ratio of Vco to Vheme (rate of circulating heme catabolism, de-termined from 51 Cr red cell survival curves) was 3. 0 ± 0. 6 (SE), indicating {{that most of the}} CO originated from sources other than circulating erythrocyte hemoglobin, in contrast to previous findings in patients with hemolytic ane-mia, where Vco paralleled Vheme closely. After administration of glycine- 2 - 4 C to these patients, endogenous CO was isolated by washout of body CO stores at high PO 2 or by reacting peripheral venous blood samples with ferricyanide. The CO was then oxidized to CO 2 by palladium chloride and trapped for counting in a liquid scintillation spec-trometer. "Early labeled " peaks of 14 CO were demonstrated which paralleled "early labeled " peaks of stercobilin and preceded maximal labeling of circu-lating heme. Production of "early labeled " 14 CO in patients with ineffective erythropoiesis was greatly increased, up to 14 times that found in a normal subject. The increased Vco and "early 14 CO " production shown by these patients are presumably related mainly to heme catabolism in the marrow. The possi-bility exists that hepatic heme and porphyrin compounds may also contribute significantly to Vco, as suggested by the finding of a high Vco in an additional patient with porphyria cutanea tarda...|$|R
40|$|The Maxima {{is a new}} {{breathing}} system which {{makes it possible to}} monitor cardiac output (Q̇) noninvasively and to follow trends continuously. When used as a <b>rebreathing</b> <b>system</b> in controlled ventilation, the Maxima selectively eliminates alveolar gas and no fresh gas (V̇F) is eliminated. Without the need for a mixing chamber, eliminated CO 2 (FĒCO 2) may measured directly. With steady state conditions, and assuming a respiratory quotient of 1, carbon dioxide production (V̇CO 2) = V̇F x FĒCO 2. The indirect Fick principle applied to CO 2 exchange (Q̇ = V̇CO 2 /venous-to-arterial CO 2 content difference (C(a) CO 2 -C(v) CO 2)) may be modified to Q̇ = V̇F x FĒCO 2 /(C(a) CO 2 -C(v) CO 2). If V̇F in the {{breathing system}} is adjusted so that FĒCO 2 is equal to C(a) CO 2 -C(v) CO 2, then Q̇ = V̇F.

40|$|Purpose: The 6 minutes walk test (6 MWT) {{is often}} {{shown to be}} the best {{predictor}} of mortality in pulmonary hypertension (PH) probably because it challenges the failing heart to deliver adequate cardiac output. We hypothesised that the 6 MWT elicits maximal cardiac output as measured during a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). Methods: 18 patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (n = 12) or pulmonary arterial hypertension (n = 6) and 10 healthy subjects performed a 6 MWT and CPET with measurements of cardiac output (<b>non</b> invasive <b>rebreathing</b> device) before and directly after exercise. Heart rate was measured during 6 MWT with a cardiofrequence meter. Results: Cardiac output and heart rate measured {{at the end of the}} 6 MWT were linearly related to 6 MW distance (mean 6 SD: 490687 m). Patients with a high NT-pro-BNP achieve a maximum cardiac output during the 6 MWT, while in normal subjects and in patients with a low-normal NT-proBNP, cardiac output at the end of a 6 MWT was lower than achieved at maximum exercise during a CPET. In both cases, heart rate is the major determinant of exercise-induced increase in cardiac output. However, stroke volume increased during CPET in healthy subjects, not in PH patients. Conclusion: Maximal cardiac output is elicited by 6 MWT in PH patients with failing right ventricle. Cardiac output increase is dependent on chronotropic response in patients with PH...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Retinal {{vascular}} reactivity is impaired {{in patients}} with diabetes and {{is thought to be}} involved in the onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Previous studies that have utilized hyperoxia to assess retinal vascular reactivity have been limited due to confounding factors associated with the administration of oxygen and have used a variety of different instruments to measure retinal blood flow. The influence of blood glucose at the time of blood flow assessment has also not been systemically investigated. The specific aims of each Chapter are as follows: Chapter 3 : To compare three systems used to administer hyperoxia to human subjects. Chapter 4 : To quantify the magnitude and timeline of change of retinal hemodynamic parameters induced by an isocapnic hyperoxic stimulus. Chapters 5, 6 and 7 : To quantify the magnitude of change of retinal hemodynamic parameters induced by hyperoxia, hyperglycemia and combined hyperoxia / hyperglycemia, respectively, in groups of diabetic patients with no clinically visible, and mild-to-moderate, DR and in age-matched subjects without diabetes. Methods Chapter 3 : Subjects breathed air followed by oxygen, or oxygen plus carbon dioxide using a non-rebreathing system, or air followed by oxygen using a sequential <b>rebreathing</b> <b>system.</b> The magnitude of change and variability of CO 2 concentrations was compared between systems. Chapter 4 : Baseline retinal blood flow data was acquired while the subjects breathed air using a sequential <b>rebreathing</b> <b>system.</b> An isocapnic hyperoxic stimulus was initiated and maintained for 20 minutes. Air was then re-administered for 10 minutes. Retinal blood flow measurements were acquired every minute over the course of the study. The magnitude of change of each hemodynamic parameter was determined by fitting individual data with a sigmoidal function. For Chapter 5, 6 and 7 diabetic patients with no clinically visible, and mild-to-moderate, DR were stratified into groups based upon their retinopathy status. Age-matched non-diabetic subjects were recruited as controls. Baseline retinal blood flow data was acquired while subjects breathed air. Retinal blood flow measurements were then acquired after exposure to (a) hyperoxia, (b) hyperglycemia and (c) combined hyperoxic / hyperglycemic stimuli. Change in hemodynamic parameters was compared between groups and correlated with objective measures of retinal edema. Results Chapter 3 : The difference in group mean end-tidal CO 2 levels between baseline and hyperoxia was significant for oxygen administration using a non-rebreathing <b>system.</b> The sequential <b>rebreathing</b> technique resulted in a significantly lower variability of individual CO 2 levels than either of the other techniques. Chapter 4 : An ~ 11 % decrease of diameter, ~ 36 % decrease of velocity and ~ 48 % decrease of blood flow was observed in response to isocapnic hyperoxia in young, healthy subjects. A response time of 2. 30 ± 0. 53 minutes and 2. 62 ± 0. 54 minutes was observed for diameter and velocity, respectively. Chapter 5 : Retinal blood velocity, flow, and WSR significantly decreased in response to isocapnic hyperoxia in all groups. The magnitude of the reduction of blood flow was significantly reduced with increasing severity of retinopathy. There was a significant relationship between baseline objective edema index values and retinal vascular reactivity. Chapter 6 : A significant change in blood glucose level was observed for all groups. No significant change in any hemodynamic parameter was found {{in patients with}} diabetes and in age-matched subjects without diabetes. Chapter 7 : Retinal blood velocity and flow significantly decreased in all groups in response to combined hyperoxic / hyperglycemic provocation. The vascular reactivity response was not significantly different across the groups. Conclusions Chapter 3 : Control of CO 2 is necessary to attain standardized, reproducible hyperoxic stimuli for the assessment of retinal vascular reactivity. Chapter 4 : Arteriolar retinal vascular reactivity to isocapnic hyperoxic provocation occurs within a maximum of 4 minutes. Although there was a trend for diameter to respond before velocity, the response characteristics were not significantly different between diameter and velocity. Different response characteristics of the retinal vasculature to transmural pressure mediated autoregulation as opposed to metabolic mediated vascular reactivity are suggested. Chapter 5 : The vascular reactivity response in terms of the reduction of blood flow relative to baseline was significant in all groups but the magnitude of the change in flow was significantly reduced with increasing severity of retinopathy. A loss of retinal vascular reactivity is indicated in patients with moderate DR without clinically evident diabetic macular edema (DME), and in patients with DME. Chapter 6 : Unaltered retinal arteriolar blood flow was found 1 hour after glucose ingestion in patients with diabetes and in age-matched subjects without diabetes. These results do not support the theory that retinal blood flow is affected by an acute increase of blood glucose in diabetic patients and in subjects without diabetes. Chapter 7 : The vascular reactivity response to a combined hyperoxic / hyperglycemic provocation produced a pronounced reduction in blood flow. Unlike the response to hyperoxia alone, the vascular reactivity response was not significantly different across the groups. This suggests that hyperglycemia may influence the retinal vascular reactivity response to hyperoxia...|$|R

40|$|Objective: PRRSV {{is one of}} {{the most}} causative agents in {{respiratory}} diseases in swine. This study aimed to evaluate respiratory disorders caused by PRRSV in spontaneous breathing pigs using noninvasive methods. Animals and Methods: In this negative controlled study altogether 48 German Hybrid Pigs at the age of eight weeks were included and divided into four groups. Twelve pigs were experimentally infected (intranasally and intramuscularly) with US PRRSV isolate VR 2332 (substudy 1), with EU PRRSV isolate 205817 (substudy 2), respectively, while the two control groups received physiological saline. Beside daily clinical examination of all pigs, pulmonary function tests (PFT) were performed in eight pigs per group until 18 days post infection (dpi) to evaluate i) breathing pattern, ii) respiratory mechanics, iii) diffusion of oxygen from the lung into the blood, iv) functional residual capacity and v) parameters of CO 2 -elimination. Therefore the methods impulse oscilloresistometry, <b>rebreathing</b> <b>system</b> (He, CO) and capnovolumetry (each Jaeger, Hoechberg, Germany) were applied via a tightly fitting face mask. Four pigs per group (without PFT) were sacrificed at 10 dpi and eight pigs per group (with PFT) at 21 dpi for pathological examination. Differences between groups were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test (P ≤ 0. 05). Results: Pigs infected with PRRSV developed fever, increased respiratory rates as well as cough, dyspnoea and reduced behavior accompanied of reduced appetite. Compared to controls, lung functions in pigs challenged with PRRSV were characterized by - obstructions of peripheral airways due to bronchospasms (increased respiratory resistance at frequencies ≤ 5 Hz, increased resistance of distal airways, increased ratios of the mixing volume expired between 50 and 75 % of the end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration and the inspired volume) - upper airway opening (increased respiratory resistance at frequencies ≥ 10 Hz, decreased resistance of proximal airways) - restrictions (decreased respiratory reactance) - ventilatory asynchronisms due to obstructions and restrictions (changes in morphology of the curve of the capnogram, especially increase of slope II and III of the capnogram) - development of ‚trapped air’ in pigs challenged with PRRSV-EU due to obstructions (increased functional residual capacity) - increased death space ventilation (increased ratios of dead spaces and tidal volume according to Langley, Threshold and Bohr) - deteriorations in pulmonary gas exchange (reduced transferfactor of the lung for carbon monoxide) due to interstitial pneumonia, alveolar exsudate, ‘trapped air’, disturbances in ventilation to perfusion ratio and reduced alveolar volume - fast and superficial breathing pattern (increased respiratory rate, reduced tidal volume) Pigs challenged with PRRSV isolate 205817 developed more severe clinical signs compared to pigs challenged with PRRSV isolate VR 2332. It is not ecxluded if the retrospective determined coinfection with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae had had an influence on the degree of the severty of the clinical pattern and pulmonary dysfunction. Conclusions: Acute infections with PRRSV were associated with obstructive and restrictive disorders, ventilatory asynchronisms as well as deteriorations in pulmonary gas exchange. These pulmonary dysfunctions are responsible for compensatory changes in breathing pattern and are inducing the clinical symptom dyspnoea...|$|R

40|$|Avaliou-se o efeito da dexmedetomidina sobre o ritmo cardíaco em 20 cães, sem raça definida, de ambos os sexos e considerados sadios, anestesiados pelo sevofluorano e submetidos a doses crescentes de adrenalina. Os animais foram, aleatoriamente, distribuídos em dois grupos (placebo e dexmedetomidina). No grupo placebo, os animais receberam, por via intravenosa, solução de NaCl a 0, 9 %, na dose de 0, 3 ml/kg. Foram considerados dois momentos, M 0 e M 1, imediatamente antes e após a aplicação, respectivamente. Após 10 minutos, realizou-se a indução anestésica com sevofluorano, por meio de máscara facial vedada, até a perda do reflexo laringotraqueal. Em seguida, procedeu-se à intubação orotraqueal e a manutenção da anestesia foi realizada com a administração de sevofluorano na concentração de 1, 5 CAM, em circuito anestésico com reinalação parcial de gases. Decorridos 20 minutos da indução anestésica, iniciou-se a administração intravenosa contínua de solução de adrenalina a 2 % em doses crescentes de 1, 2, 3, 4 e 5 mg/kg/min, por meio de bomba de infusão, com aumento da dose em intervalos de 10 minutos. Imediatamente antes desse acréscimo eram feitas as mensurações (M 2 a M 6). No grupo dexmedetomidina empregou-se a mesma metodologia substituindo-se a solução de NaCl a 0, 9 % por hidrocloridrato de dexmedetomidina, na dose de 1 µg/kg. Foram registradas as pressões arteriais, em M 0 e em M 2 a M 6, e o traçado eletrocardiográfico, na derivação DII (M 2 a M 6), considerando-se para efeito estatístico o número total de bloqueios atrioventriculares (BAV) de primeiro e segundo graus e de complexos ventriculares prematuros (ESV), coincidentes com cada dose de adrenalina. Os dados foram submetidos à análise de variância seguida pelo teste de Tukey (P The {{effect of}} {{dexmedetomidine}} on the cardiac rhythm in twenty healthy mongrel dogs {{of both sexes}} anesthetized with sevofluorane and submitted to increasing doses of adrenaline was evaluated. The animals were randomly allotted to different treatment groups. Animals of placebo group were intravenous injected with 0. 9 % NaCl solution at 0. 3 ml/kg/IV. Two moments were considered, M 0 and M 1, the moments immediately before and after application, respectively. Ten minutes later, the dogs were anesthetized using sevofluorane via face mask until lost of their laringotracheal reflex. Then, orotracheal intubation was performed and maintenance of anesthesia was kept with 1, 5 MAC sevofluorane using an anesthetic circuit with a <b>rebreathing</b> <b>system.</b> Twenty minutes after anesthesia induction, continuous IV administration of 2 % adrenaline solution was given at increasing doses of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mg/kg/min., every ten minutes, respectively. The moments M 2 to M 6 were measured immediately before the next increase of dose. In dexmedetomidine group, the same technique was used replacing 0. 9 % NaCl by dexmedetomidine hydrochloride at 1 mg/kg. Blood pressures were recorded at M 0 and M 2 to M 6. Electrocardiography line in the derivation DII (M 2 to M 6) was used to observe the number of atrioventricular blocks (AVB) of first and second degrees and ventricular premature complexes (VPC). Statistic evaluation was performed by analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test (P< 0. 05). Dexmedetomidine significantly altered the atrioventricular conduction resulting in a higher occurrence of AVB. This drug {{reduced the number of}} VPC at 2 and 3 mg/kg/min of adrenaline. After administration of dexmedetomidine, reduction of arterial blood pressure up to one hour and reduction of cardiac rate were observed...|$|R
40|$|IntroductIon: Anesthesia {{machine is}} a minimum {{requirement}} of any operation theatre. The {{essential component of}} anesthesia machine are to provide oxygen & desired concentration of anesthetic agent, breathing system preventing CO 2 <b>rebreathing</b> and scavenging <b>system.</b> All modern anesthesia machines are well incorporated with all essential components & run by high-tech sophisticated electronic chips. Because of this high-technology, the modern anesthesia machines are expensive, difficult to understand the function and maintain. Furthermore, all modern machines require continuous supply of pressurized medical gas to run. Therefore, to have good running operation theater people from resource limited area were waiting to have affordable machine which can run without continuous pressurized medical gas but having all essential functional component of ideal anesthesia machine until early 2010 when universal anesthesia machine (UAM) was developed in united kingdom. The objective of this observational study is to assess the essential functions of anesthesia machine in UAM and the user’s perspective of layout and setting up of machine. Methods: Four UAM machine in four different hospitals of Nepal were supplied and oriented with 3 - 5 days program consisting of didactic and hands-on training in each site separately. All users of fou...|$|R
40|$|Thirty asphyxiated {{neonates}} were resuscitated endotracheally with an anaesthetic <b>rebreathing</b> bag. The <b>system</b> was {{not limited}} either by pressure or by volume and chest movement {{was used as the}} criterion for adequate inflation. Inflation pressure and flow were recorded during resuscitation, and flow was integrated to obtain volume. Median mean pressure over the first 10 inflations was 40 cm H 2 O and this dropped during later resuscitation to 29 cm H 2 O. The volume delivered did not change significantly, so volume divided by pressure increased from a median of 0. 18 to 0. 35 ml/kg/cm H 2 O. Fourteen infants formed part of their functional residual capacity with artificial ventilation and five with spontaneous breaths. Eleven infants showed no evidence of functional residual capacity formation. In the 22 preterm infants there was a strong association between absence of functional residual capacity formation and later hyaline membrane disease that required ventilation. We suggest that pressures of more than than 30 cm H 2 O may be helpful during initial resuscitation and that there should be further study of devices using positive end expiratory pressure for resuscitation of preterm infants...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: /st>The {{relative}} respiratory {{effects of}} fentanyl and remifentanil, administered as i. v. bolus, have not previously been studied. We determined what remifentanil bolus dose gave the same maximum depression of ventilation as 1 µg kg(- 1) of fentanyl. METHODS: /st>Twelve healthy volunteers <b>rebreathed</b> in a <b>system</b> designed to dampen variations in end-tidal carbon dioxide tension so that measurements would be obtained at similar levels of CO(2) stimulation. The minute ventilation was measured before (V(preinj)) and after injection (V(nadir)) of fentanyl, 1 µg kg(- 1), and remifentanil, 0. 25, 0. 5, and 1 µg kg(- 1). The remifentanil doses were plotted against V(nadir) /V(preinj) in a log-probit diagram {{to determine what}} amount gave the same maximum ventilatory depression as the fentanyl dose. RESULTS: /st>V(nadir) was [median (inter-quartile range) ] 51 (38 - 64) % of V(preinj) after fentanyl, and 70 (61 - 77), 50 (46 - 56), and 29 (24 - 38) %, respectively, after remifentanil. The nadir occurred 5. 0 (4. 4 - 7. 0) min after fentanyl, and 3. 8 (2. 7 - 4. 6), 2. 9 (2. 7 - 3. 2), and 3. 0 (2. 7 - 3. 2) min after remifentanil injection. at ventilation nadir was 6. 26 (5. 98 - 6. 62) kPa after fentanyl, and 6. 18 (6. 12 - 6. 50), 6. 11 (5. 91 - 6. 45), and 6. 11 (5. 93 - 6. 45) kPa after remifentanil 0. 25, 0. 5, and 1 µg kg(- 1), respectively. A remifentanil dose of 0. 47 (0. 42 - 0. 62) µg kg(- 1) was equidepressant to 1 µg kg(- 1) of fentanyl. Fifteen minutes after fentanyl injection, the median minute ventilation was 30 - 40 % less than after injection of remifentanil, 0. 25 and 0. 5 µg kg(- 1) (P Fentanyl, 1 µg kg(- 1), and remifentanil, 0. 5 µg kg(- 1), gave similar maximum ventilatory depression. The onset of and recovery from ventilatory depression were faster with remifentanil...|$|R
