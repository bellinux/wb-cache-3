5|$|The U.S. {{bombing of}} <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam</b> in February 1965 had a decisive {{impact on the}} Soviet Union's {{strategy}} in Vietnam. Since Ho Chi Minh and his Communist Party won control of <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam</b> in 1954, Ho's government had not always enjoyed cordial relations with their Soviet allies. For example, in 1957 the Soviet government proposed that both North and South Vietnam be given {{a seat in the}} United Nations, a move which would have undermined the North's claim as the sole legitimate government of the whole country. Then in February 1964, <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam</b> joined the People's Republic of China in refusing to sign the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which was an insult to the policy of co-existence adopted by the then Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. By that time, however, Khrushchev had already begun the process of disengagement from Vietnam because of the growing conflict in the region was becoming more expensive for the Soviet Union, with <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam</b> relying more on it for large amounts of economic and military aid.|$|E
5|$|The four {{objectives}} of the operation (which evolved over time) were to boost the sagging morale of the Saigon regime in the Republic of Vietnam, to persuade <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam</b> to cease its support for the communist insurgency in South Vietnam without actually taking any ground forces into communist <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam,</b> to destroy North Vietnam's transportation system, industrial base, and air defenses, and to halt the flow of men and material into South Vietnam. Attainment of these objectives was made difficult by both the restraints imposed upon the U.S. and its allies by Cold War exigencies and by the military aid and assistance received by <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam</b> from its communist allies, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China (PRC) and North Korea.|$|E

5|$|American {{analysts were}} elated when they {{discovered}} {{that the number of}} trucks ordered by <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam</b> from its communist allies in late 1971 exceeded those of previous years. 6,000 vehicles had been ordered from the Soviet Union alone (as opposed to the usual 3,000) and this seemed to indicate that the enemy was hurting for transportation and that the campaign was working. However, since 80 percent of the vehicles arrived in <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam</b> at least six weeks before the launching of the Nguyen Hue Offensive (known to the U.S. as the Easter Offensive, they probably reflected anticipated losses.|$|E
5|$|As U.S. troop {{withdrawals}} continued, conscription {{was reduced}} and in 1973 ended; {{the armed forces}} became all-volunteer. After years of fighting, the Paris Peace Accords were signed {{at the beginning of}} 1973. The agreement implemented a cease fire and allowed for the withdrawal of remaining American troops without requiring the 160,000 <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam</b> Army regulars located in the South to withdraw. Once American combat support ended, there was a brief truce, before fighting broke out again. <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam</b> conquered South Vietnam in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Between March 1965 and November 1968, {{aircraft}} of the U.S. Air Force {{had flown}} 153,784 attack sorties against <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam,</b> while the Navy and Marine Corps had added another 152,399. On 31 December 1967, the Department of Defense announced that 864,000 tons of American bombs {{had been dropped}} on <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam</b> during Rolling Thunder, compared with 653,000 tons dropped during the entire Korean War and 503,000 tons in the Pacific theater during the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to combat}} and {{operational}} circumstances, 506 U.S. Air Force, 397 Navy, and 19 Marine Corps aircraft were lost over or near <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam.</b> During the operation, of the 745 crewmen shot down, the U.S. Air Force recorded 145 rescued, 255 killed, 222 captured (23 of whom died in captivity), and 123 missing. Figures on U.S. Navy and Marine Corps casualties were harder to come by. During the 44-month time frame, 454 naval aviators were killed, captured, or missing during combined operations over <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam</b> and Laos.|$|E
5|$|Hanoi, {{which had}} {{continuously}} stipulated {{that it would}} not conduct negotiations while the bombing continued, finally agreed to meet with the Americans for preliminary talks in Paris. As a result, President Johnson declared that a complete bombing halt over <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam</b> would go into effect on 1 November 1968, just prior to the U.S. presidential election. Although the bombing halt was to be linked to progress in the peace talks, the Joint Chiefs were skeptical that the administration would reopen the bombing campaign under any circumstances. They were correct. <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam</b> was not the target of intense bombing again for another three and half years.|$|E

5|$|The {{rift between}} Khrushchev's Soviet {{government}} and <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam</b> was clearly obvious in August 1964, when the Soviet Union responded {{in a relatively}} muted fashion after the U.S. conducted air strikes against North Vietnamese Navy bases {{in retaliation for the}} Tonkin Gulf incident. Despite the Soviets’ lack of response, the North Vietnamese leadership restrained itself from criticizing the Soviet government, as they were still hoping that Khrushchev would supply <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam</b> with the anti-aircraft weapons required to defend against further U.S. air attacks. However, the event which occurred in Moscow in October 1964 worked in North Vietnam's favor, as Khrushchev was removed from power. Keen to counteract Chinese influence in the region, a new Soviet government led by Alexei Kosygin sought to end a defense pact with <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the best}} interdiction efforts of Rolling Thunder, however, the NLF and PAVN {{launched}} their largest offensive thus {{far in the}} war on 30 January 1968, striking throughout South Vietnam during the lunar new year holiday. The Tet Offensive concluded as a military disaster for <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam</b> and its NLF allies, but it also adversely affected U.S. public opinion, which in turn affected the will of Washington. Fortunately for <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam,</b> many U.S. bombing advocates (including Air Force Chief of Staff McConnell) did not want to risk the one aircraft capable of delivering a lot of bombs in bad weather – the B-52. Without them, there was little that could be done over the north in response to Tet, since bad weather minimized fighter operations until the beginning of April.|$|E

5|$|In February 1965 Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin {{travelled}} to Hanoi {{to rebuild}} Soviet ties with <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam,</b> {{and the formation}} of a military alliance was on the agenda. Coincidentally, senior security adviser to the U.S. President McGeorge Bundy was also in Saigon to report on the political chaos in South Vietnam. In the shadow of those events, the Viet Cong 409th Battalion staged an attack on Camp Holloway on 7 February 1965. This time, with his victory in the 1964 presidential election secured, Johnson decided to launch Operation Flaming Dart which entailed strikes on North Vietnamese military targets. However, with Kosygin still in Hanoi during the U.S bombing, the Soviet government decided to step up their military aid to <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam,</b> thereby signalling a major reversal of Khrushchev's policy in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|In Moscow, between November and December 1964, at two {{sessions}} of the Presidium of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee, Soviet leaders discussed {{the topic of}} Soviet military aid to <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam.</b> Although details of the discussions were not made public, the first indication of Soviet strategy in Vietnam came on 24 December 1964, when the Soviet government invited the North Vietnamese-backed National Liberation Front to open a permanent mission in Moscow. Then on 4 February 1965 McGeorge Bundy, national security adviser to President Johnson, arrived in Saigon {{to meet with the}} then U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam, General Maxwell Taylor, to discuss the political situation in the country. Two days later on 6 February 1965, Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin arrived in Hanoi for a historic visit to <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam,</b> included in his entourage was a team of Soviet missile experts.|$|E

50|$|U.S.-Vietnam {{diplomatic}} and economic relations were non-existent {{for more than}} fifteen years following communist <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam's</b> victory in 1975 over U.S. ally South Vietnam. During that time, the United States maintained restrictions onforeign assistance to unified Vietnam.|$|R
5|$|In early 1964 Sihanouk {{signed a}} secret {{agreement}} with <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam</b> and the Viet Cong, allowing Chinese military aid meant {{for them to}} be delivered through Sihanoukville's port. In turn, the Cambodian army would be paid for delivering food supplies to the Viet Cong, {{and at the same time}} skim off 10percent of all military hardware supplies. In addition, he also allowed the Viet Cong to build a trail through eastern Cambodia, so that their troops could receive war supplies from <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam.</b> The trail later became known as the Sihanouk Trail. When the US learned of Viet Cong presence in eastern Cambodia, they started a bombing campaign over it, spurring Sihanouk to sever diplomatic ties with the US in May 1965. As a result of this secret agreement, Communist countries, including China, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia, provided military aid to Cambodia.|$|E
5|$|<b>North</b> <b>Vietnam</b> {{continued}} {{to build up}} its combat units in South Vietnam. With the threat of U.S. airpower removed, the North Vietnamese military moved anti-aircraft units into South Vietnam, and deployed a sophisticated air-defence network that included the long-range SA-2 surface-to-air missile system, radar-guided anti-aircraft guns and the SA-7 Grail shoulder-launched missile The strong presence of North Vietnamese anti-aircraft units, which covered much of the northern provinces of South Vietnam, forced Republic of Vietnam Air Force reconnaissance and fighter aircraft to fly at higher altitudes to avoid being hit by surface-to-air missiles. Consequently, when <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam</b> went on the offensive again in 1975, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force was severely handicapped.|$|E
5|$|Operation Rolling Thunder was {{the title}} of a gradual and {{sustained}} aerial bombardment campaign conducted by the U.S. 2nd Air Division (later Seventh Air Force), U.S. Navy, and Republic of Vietnam Air Force (VNAF) against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (<b>North</b> <b>Vietnam)</b> from 2 March 1965 until 2 November 1968, during the Vietnam War.|$|E
50|$|In March 1975 Hanoi {{made its}} next seriously {{aggressive}} move. In the preceding two years, <b>North</b> <b>Vietnam's</b> army patiently {{moved into the}} South enormous quantities of Soviet artillery, surface-to-air missiles, and armored vehicles, along with 100,000 fresh troops.|$|R

50|$|On 12 June, the {{remaining}} team members were transferred back to Grayback. With {{the likelihood of}} a successful prisoner escape by sea lessened by the recent U.S. mining of <b>North</b> <b>Vietnams</b> ports and rivers, Operation Thunderhead was soon terminated.|$|R
