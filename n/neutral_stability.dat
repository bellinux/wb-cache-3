40|$|The {{statistics}} of atmospheric stability and non-dimensional wind profiles are studied using the standard surface-layer theory at Egmond aan Zee in the North Sea. Measurements at 21, 70 and 116 m {{are used to}} validate the theoretical profiles. Charnock’s relation is used to estimate the sea surface roughness. Bulk Richardson number is used to estimate the Obukhov length. The measured sea water temperature has a positive bias of 0. 82 ?C resulting in the dominance of unstable conditions and a poor agreement of the theoretical wind profiles with the measurements. The conditions at Egmond aan Zee are dominated by unstable and <b>neutral</b> <b>stabilities.</b> The theoretical wind profiles agree very well with the measurements in the unstable and neutral conditions.

A positively stable aircraft will also resist any bank movement. A Cessna 152 is an example of a stable aircraft. Similarly, an aircraft with <b>neutral</b> <b>stability</b> will not return to its trimmed setting without control input, but will oscillate in a stable simple harmonic motion around the trimmed setting continuously, neither increasing nor decreasing oscillation amplitude, and be susceptible to bank influences.|$|E
50|$|The {{value of}} 1/7 for α is {{commonly}} {{assumed to be}} constant in wind resource assessments, because {{the differences between the}} two levels are not usually so great as to introduce substantial errors into the estimates (usually < 50 m). However, when a constant exponent is used, it does not account for the roughness of the surface, the displacement of calm winds from the surface due to the presence of obstacles (i.e., zero-plane displacement), or the stability of the atmosphere. In places where trees or structures impede the near-surface wind, the use of a constant 1/7 exponent may yield quite erroneous estimates, and the log wind profile is preferred. Even under <b>neutral</b> <b>stability</b> conditions, an exponent of 0.11 is more appropriate over open water (e.g., for offshore wind farms), than 0.143, which is more applicable over open land surfaces.|$|E
40|$|We {{extend the}} notions of {{evolutionary}} stability and, for the first time, that of <b>neutral</b> <b>stability</b> to asymmetric games played between two populations.

For bimatrix games, <b>neutral</b> <b>stability</b> in the asymmetric population game is found to be a weaker concept than <b>neutral</b> <b>stability</b> in the asymmetric contest. Moreover existence is guaranteed for 2 x 2 bimatrix games. Sets of neutrally stable strategy pairs such that for any pair of mutants not in the set at least one mutant is driven out are called evolutionary stable.
