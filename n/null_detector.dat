40|$|Graduation date: 1960 The {{performance}} of certain high-gain amplifiers, {{such as those}} used in <b>null</b> <b>detectors,</b> can be greatly improved by using a nonlinear element in a feedback loop. With the addition of nonlinear feedback, {{it is possible to}} obtain an amplifier that can handle a large dynamic range of input signals without saturating or blocking. The desired characteristic of the amplifier is a voltage gain that varies instantaneously and inversely with input signal amplitude. Thus, for small input signals, the voltage gain is maximum and as the input signal amplitude increases, the voltage gain decreases to unity or less. The characteristics of a number of suitable nonlinear elements are investigated and a mathematical function is derived to describe them. The variation in voltage gain of an amplifier with a single nonlinear feedback loop is investigated, both theoretically and experimentally, and the results are in good agreement. Several single-loop nonlinear feedback amplifiers can be connected in cascade to obtain the equivalent of nonlinear elements that are not available. This method is used in an example of an approximation of a logarithmic function...|$|R

50|$|For the {{comparison}} of two currents these are fed through two wires which are led through a superconducting tube. The Meissner effect induces a screening current on the inner surface of the tube, flowing opposite to and being exactly {{as large as the}} sum of the currents inside the tube. Thus, this shielding current exactly cancels the magnetic field inside the tube produced by the currents in the wires. The screening current flows back across the outer surface of the tube, giving rise to a magnetic field in the room outside of the tube. This field is detected by a highly sensitive magnetometer, acting as a <b>null</b> <b>detector.</b> The signal of this <b>null</b> <b>detector</b> thus is a measure for the equality of the currents; in particular it is zero if the two currents are of exactly equal magnitude.

Two common types of tracking loop dynamics, {{as well as the}} automatic gain control (AGC), are accounted for in the models. The <b>null</b> <b>detector</b> is formulated in a general way that encompasses many important error detector laws, including centroid and leading- edge. Both discrete-time and continuous-time dynamic models are presented for each class of tracking loop. The discrete-time models are derived using an analytical description of the pulse- to-pulse dynamics of the tracker. The continuous-time models are approximations of their discrete-time counterparts for sufficiently small values of the pulse repetition interval. Each of the models is analyzed for a deterministic target return condition. General criteria for asymptotic stability of equilibrium points of the models are obtained. The most striking of the stability criteria is a sign requirement on the slope of of a "range error curve".

40|$|The SQUID sensor is {{typically}} operated in a <b>null</b> <b>detector</b> mode where an analogue flux-locked-loop, FLL, provides a negative feedback to maintain linear operation. The modulated SQUID signal is amplified, filtered, demodulated, and integrated in the FLL. The resulting analog signal {{is a measure}} of the magnetic field and noise at the SQUID and is also fed back to the modulation and feedback (M & F) coil to null the flux at the SQUID to maintain the linear operating point. Thus, the FLL output signal is proportional to the change in magnetic field at the SQUID pickup coil, provided the slew rate and dynamic range of the SQUID and FLL system are not exceeded. The goal of the work is to advance technologies needed for a practical fieldable SQUID biomagnetic sensor. We used HTC SQUIDs to realize the benefits noted above.

40|$|The {{viscosity}} of xenon {{has been}} measured along ten isochores and the viscosity of ethane has been measured along five isochores {{in the region}} of the gas-liquid critical point. The viscometer was a specially cut quartz cylinder, which was excited into a torsionally oscillating mode upon application of an alternating voltage. The cylinder, oscillating in this manner, generated a viscous wave when immersed in a fluid. The viscous wave caused an impedance loading on the quartz which changed its resonant resistance and frequency. This change in resonant properties can be related to the viscosity-density product of the fluid. The resonant properties of the quartz crystal were measured by connecting the crystal to the unknown arm of a Wheatstone bridge circuit, modified so as to measure parallel resistance and capacitance. The crystal was driven by a very stable frequency generator, and the circuit was tuned using an oscilloscope as a <b>null</b> <b>detector.</b> The crystal was enclosed in a high pressure stainless steel cell and placed in a water thermostat which controlled temperature to ± 0. 001 °C. The temperature was measured with a calibrated platinum resistance thermometer. The density was determined by a gravimetric technique. The viscosities exhibit an "anomalous" increase as the critical temperature is approached along an isochore of close to critical density. The anomaly is consistent with a logarithmic divergence of the form: ∆ƞ = A log ɛ + ʙ where ∆ƞ is the anomalous viscosity, ɛ is the reduced temperature difference from critical, and A and ʙ are constants. The possibility of an exponential divergence or a cusp-type finite limit for viscosity is not precluded, however. The critical temperatures and densities have been determined by visual observations. For xenon, T c = 16. 627 ± 0. 005 °C, ρ c = 1. 11 ± 0. 01 g/cm 3; for ethane, T c = 32. 218 ± 0. 005 °C, ρ c = 0. 2055 ± 0. 002 g/cm 3.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{attempts}} have been made to find the protonic photoconductivity of ice (abbreviated as PPC hereafter), but most of them were not successful. Camp and Spears (1) tried to excite PPC of pure ice single crystals by a xenon lamp and concluded that the probability of photodissociation of ice, if any, is very small. De Haas et al. (2) and Itagaki et al. (3) used gamma-rays, X-rays, or electron beams, and found a change in the electrical conductivity. Very high-energy beams were used in these experiments, however, which yielded radiation-induced damage and defects in the bulk specimen. PPC was observed in ice doped with o- nitrobenzoaldehyde (abbreviated as NBAld); ice was grown from aqueous solution of NBAld at the concentration of 6. 6 x 10 - 3 M (moles per liter) and cut into a plate of 4 mn in thickness. Network or disk electrodes were fixed to the ice sample, to which ultraviolet rays were emitted by using a xenon lamp of 300 W. Conductivities and capacitances were measured by using a bridge and <b>null</b> <b>detector</b> at frequencies between 30 Hz and 30 kHz. Both the conductance and capacitance were found to increase when the ice sample was illuminated by the ultraviolet light, however the increase in conductance was noted to be larger than that in capacitance. It was also found that the increase in the limiting high-frequency conductivity was much larger than that in the low-frequency conductivity. The increasing rate of conductance with time showed a maximum at the wavelength between 390 and 400 nm. A theoretical model of PPC in NBAld-doped ice was introduced; the model is based on the observation of Konstantinov et al. (4) that protons are released from NBAld by the ultraviolet illumination. It is further assumed that a photo-proton released creates an H 3 O ion and a D-defect. Theoretically estimated increases in the conductivities were in good agreement with those observed. The observed time-dependence of PPC was explained by the formation of small clusters of NBAld molecules in ice; estimated sizes of the clusters were roughly 1 µm...|$|E

They are interpreted as resulting from a single electronic transition having g // = 1. 55 ± 0. 02 split by the nuclear spin of 5 ⁄ 2 into six hyperfine lines. The transition is ot between the states of a Kramers' doublet. A crystal field of C 3 h symmetry will give a singlet and J doubts, which will be split by the Jahn Teller effect. We propose that the transition occurs between states described by J z quantizization as cos⊖ | ± 2 > + sin ⊖ | ∓ 4 > with ⊖ = 22 °. The hyperfine parameters are interpreted in terms of the spin Hamiltonian H = βg // H z S z + AI z S z giving A = 0. 078 ± 0. 001 cm - 1. Neodymium: A main line flanked by 15 resolved hyperfine lines was observed. They are interpreted as resulting from a single electronic transition having g ⊥ = 2. 72 ± 0. 02 and g // = 0. 45 ± 0. 05 split by the nuclear spins of 7 ⁄ 2 of two odd isotopes, Nd 143 and Nd 145 into sixteen hyperfine lines, one of which was not resolved from the main line. The hyperfine parameters are interpreted in terms of the usual spin Hamiltonian H =β[g // H z S z + g ⊥ (H x S x + H y S y) ] + AI z S z + Β(I x S x + I y S y) giving B 143 = 0. 0372 cm - 1 B 145 = 0. 0194 cm - 1 The ratio of the nuclear magnetic moment of Nd 143 to that of Nd 145 is 1. 61. The transition is proposed to occur within the Kramers' doublet in J z quantization of cos⊖ | ± 7 ⁄ 2 > + sin⊖ | ∓ 5 ⁄ 2 > where ∈ = 47 ° The line width of the main line was 170 gauss which is wider than theory predicts. Several weak unidentified lines were observed. Samarium: A main line flanked by 16 fully resolved hyperfine lines was observed. They are interpreted as resulting from a single electronic transition having g⊥ = 0. 40 ± 0. 05, g // = 0. 76 ± 0. 01 split by the nuclear spins of 7 &frasl 2 of two odd isotopes, Sm 147. The hyperfine parameters are interpreted from the same spin Hamiltonian as (c) to be | A 147 = 0. 0346 ± 0. 0005 cm - 1 A 149 = 0. 0287 ± 0. 0005 cm - 1 B ≤ 0. 009 cm - 1 for both isotopes M N 147 M N 149  = 1. 22 The transition is proposed to occur within the Kramers' doublet in JJ z quantization of cos ⊖ | 5 &frasl 2 ± ½ > + sin&ominus | 7 &frasl 2 ± ½ > where &ominus ~ 6 °. The observed line width of 75 gauss is very much wider than theory predicts, but {{this may be due to}} a short spin lattice relaxation time. POTASSIUM MANGANICYANIDE: The effective magnetic moment, n = √ 3 X KT N β 2 approaches zero as the temperature is decreased, showing that the ground level is diamagnetic. From the temperature variation of n we can conclude that the covalent forces upon the M n +++ ion cannot be accurately represented by an electrostatic crystal field of cubic symmetry. At 293 °K the affective magnetic moment of n = 3. 6. NITRIC OXIDE CLATHRATE The effective magnetic moment of nitric oxide molecules trapped in the quinol lattice approaches zero as the temperature is decreased, showing that the ground level is diamagnetic. The first exited level is not far above the ground level as it is in the free molecule, and we conclude that there is a small interaction between the NO molecules and the quinol lattice. At 293 °K, however, the susceptability of the NO in the clathrate is that of fee NO within the experimental error, viz. 47 x 10 - 6 eml per gram. </ol...|$|E
