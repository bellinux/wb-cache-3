Samples of Appert’s <b>preserved</b> <b>foods</b> were sent to sea with Napoleon’s men and the food remained fresh for several months. Ten years later, Pierre Durand, a British merchant, patented a similar method using tin-coated canisters, and by 1813, the British Army and Navy were supplied with <b>food</b> <b>preserved</b> in tins.|$|R

40|$|Food {{dehydration}} is {{a method}} of <b>preserving</b> <b>food</b> that fits today's lifestyles.

Drying not only <b>preserves</b> <b>foods</b> but also offers new and different nutritious snacks such as dried fruits, fruit rolls, and meat jerkies. How drying works as a preservative The purpose of drying is to <b>preserve</b> <b>food</b> by lowering the amount of water or moisture in the food material to a point where microbial growth (bacteria, yeast, and mold) and chemical reactions (enzymatic deterioration) cannot destroy the food during storage. Though drying itself does not destroy enzymes, the dried food (especiall...|$|R
