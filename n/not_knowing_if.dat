At Leterrier's suggestion, the soundtrack was released on a two-disc album, which Armstrong thought was a joke until he compiled the album and Marvel asked him why they were given only one disc.|$|E
5|$|The {{information}} available in Romania for the King Carol I Bridge in Cernavodă, {{as well as}} the results of scientists in France, say that the myths are pure fiction. First of all the Romanian government never finalised the construction contract with the company of Gustave Eiffel or with another foreign company, making the decision to build the bridge only with local companies. The Cernavodă Bridge was made entirely by Romanians, fulfilling the design of Anghel Saligny, which was also the supervisor of the site. In these conditions, <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>if</b> the contract will be approved, it is unlikely that a foreign company would build the whole superstructure of the bridge. On the other hand, in Austria–Hungary {{there was no need to}} construct a low bridge like the Faidherbe because of the trade routes on the Danube River.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. troops dodged German {{machine gun}} and small arms fire {{on top of}} and under the bridge, moving from bridge girder to girder, cutting {{demolition}} wires and tossing explosive charges into the river, <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>if</b> the Germans would detonate {{the rest of them}} at any second.|$|E

25|$|Pyron's {{force of}} 300 camped at Apache Canyon, {{at one end}} of Glorieta Pass, leaving a picket post of 50 men at the summit of the pass. Chivington led 418 {{soldiers}} to the pass and, on the morning of March 26, moved out to attack. After noon Chivington’s men captured the picket post and found the main force behind them. Chivington advanced on them, but their artillery fire threw him back. He regrouped, split his force to {{the two sides of the}} pass, caught the Confederates in a crossfire, and soon forced them to retire. Pyron retired about a mile and a half (about 2=1/2 kilometers) to a narrow section of the pass and formed a defensive line before Chivington’s men appeared. The Union forces flanked Pyron’s men again and punished them with enfilade fire. Pyron ordered another retreat, but the withdrawal of the artillery caused the Confederates to become disorganized and start fighting in separate clusters of men. Chivington ordered a mounted Colorado company to make a frontal charge against the artillery; this succeeded in capturing several Confederates and scattering the rest. <b>Not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>if</b> Confederate reinforcements were nearby, Chivington then retired and went into camp at Kozlowski’s Ranch to await Slough with the main body. His small victory was a morale boost for Slough's army.|$|E

500|$|Digital Dimension {{took charge}} of the visual effects of the film. CG {{supervisor}} Jason Crosby pointed out that their studio was mainly selected for the highway sequence after the crew realized real logs only bounced about an inch off the road when dropped from a logging truck. [...] "They were concerned about how they would make the shot happen, <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>if</b> CG would work. The timing was great because we had just finished a test shot of our CG logs bouncing on the freeway. We sent a tape to Vancouver and after seeing it the crew was convinced that any of the log shots could be done with CG," [...] Crosby indicated. [...] "It began with R on the log dynamics. Scripts were written to help manage the dynamic simulations with real world numbers for gravity, density, etc. The results were remarkably similar to the original logs shot in Vancouver, a testament to the accuracy of the software and the data we had collected, however the logs still lacked the 'jumping through windshields killer instinct' we were looking for. By tweaking the parameters, we coaxed the logs into a much livelier role." [...] Senior technical director James Coulter added creative 3D tracking on shots with fast pans, motion blur, and filters such as dust, mist, slabs of bark, broken chains, and other debris. Digital artist Edmund Kozin manipulated high resolution photos which were carefully stitched together to achieve realistic texture amongst the 22 CG logs of the film. Hair shaders were also inputed for splintering and frayed wood looks for the logs. Physics such as speed and height of the logging truck, length and width of the logs, type of wood and density of a Douglas-fir were also considered.|$|E

It gives the exact questions that the student has to work out, gives them feedback by telling them if their submission is right or wrong, and also allows them to practice different problems for more practice.

30|$|Another {{weakness}} {{of the present study}} is the absence of a time stamp for each answer given to our prompts. Only the presence or the absence of an answer was recorded, but not the nature of these answers. This, unfortunately, does <b>not</b> allow <b>knowing</b> <b>if</b> the learning strategies evoked early during one’s training are the same as those mentioned towards its end.
