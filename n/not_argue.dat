Rather than admit failure, however, in 1933 the AFL proposed to use DALUs to organize workers on an industrial basis.|$|E
25|$|Responses to {{the problem}} of evil have {{sometimes}} been classified as defenses or theodicies. However, authors disagree on the exact definitions. Generally, a defense attempts to show that there is no logical incompatibility between the existence of evil and the existence of God. A defense need <b>not</b> <b>argue</b> that this is a probable or plausible explanation, only that the defense is logically possible. A defense attempts to answer the logical problem of evil.|$|E

Despite knowing it is a trap (Inara did <b>not</b> <b>argue</b> with him), Mal goes to rescue her. The Operative confronts Mal, promising {{to let him go}} free if he turns River over. Mal refuses and, with Inara's help, barely escapes. River reveals that Miranda is a planet located beyond a region of space swarming with Reavers. The crew flies to the planet Haven to ponder their next move. They find Haven devastated and their old friend, Shepherd Book (Ron Glass), mortally wounded. The Operative claims responsibility for the killings. He promises to keep pursuing them and killing anyone who assists them until he gets River.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the major}} {{decision}} that sealed {{the fate of the}} Greek campaign in Anatolia. The state and Army leadership, including King Constantine, Prime Minister Dimitrios Gounaris, and General Anastasios Papoulas, met at Kütahya where they debated the future of the campaign. The Greeks, with their faltering morale rejuvenated, failed to appraise the strategic situation that favoured the defending side; instead, pressed for a 'final solution', the leadership was polarised into the risky decision to pursue the Turks and attack their last line of defence close to Ankara. The military leadership was cautious and requested for more reinforcements and time to prepare, but did not go against the politicians. Only a few voices supported a defensive stance, including Ioannis Metaxas. Constantine by this time had little actual power and did <b>not</b> <b>argue</b> either way. After a delay of almost a month that gave time to the Turks to organise their defence, seven of the Greek divisions crossed east of the Sakarya River.|$|E
25|$|At {{the trial}} Shayler {{represented}} himself, {{claiming that the}} Official Secrets Act was incompatible with the Human Rights Act {{and that it was}} not a crime to report a crime although these arguments were dismissed by the court with the latter being ruled irrelevant. Shayler's defence attempted to argue that there were no other avenues to pursue his concerns with the service and its performance. The judge ruled that while this was true it was irrelevant. The judge instructed the jury to return a guilty verdict and that the House of Lords had ruled in another case that a defendant could <b>not</b> <b>argue</b> that he had revealed information in the public interest. After more than three hours of deliberation the jury found him guilty. In November 2002 he was sentenced to 6 months in prison, of which he served three weeks in Belmarsh prison and just under five weeks in Ford Open Prison, with the four months served on remand in France being taken into consideration. He was finally released on 23 December 2002, although he was electronically tagged and under a 7pm to 7am curfew for a further seven weeks.|$|E

25|$|MacDonald is {{best known}} for his trilogy that {{analyzes}} Judaism and Jewish culture from the perspective of evolutionary psychology, comprising A People That Shall Dwell Alone (1994), Separation and Its Discontents (1998), and The Culture of Critique (1998). He proposes that Judaism is a group evolutionary strategy to enhance the ability of Jews to out-compete non-Jews for resources. Using the term Jewish ethnocentrism, he argues that Judaism fosters in Jews a series of marked genetic traits, including above-average verbal intelligence and a strong tendency toward collectivist behavior, as manifested in a series of influential intellectual movements. MacDonald repeatedly emphasizes that he does <b>not</b> <b>argue</b> that all Jews in all circumstances display the traits he identifies; for example, his Understanding Jewish Influence argues that neoconservatism is a Jewish intellectual movement, while MacDonald also points out that American Jews generally favor the Democratic Party, not Republicans or conservatives and he also points out that in the 2000 US Presidential Election about 80% of the Jewish vote went to United States Vice President Al Gore, who was campaigning against George W. Bush, whose campaign MacDonald claims was heavily staffed with and influenced by neoconservatives.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the liberation}} of the country, the {{recognition}} of the imperial title of the monarch and the restoration of the Bulgarian Patriarchate became the priority of the Bulgarian foreign policy. The continuous state of war against the Byzantine empire urged Bulgarian rulers to turn to the Papacy. In his correspondence with Pope Innocent III, Kaloyan (r. 1197–1207) demanded imperial title and a Patriarchate, basing his claims on the heritage of the First Bulgarian Empire. In return, Kaloyan promised to accept Papal suzerainty over the Bulgarian Church. The union between Bulgaria and Rome was formalized on 7 October 1205, when Kaloyan was crowned King by a papal legate and the Archbishop Basil of Tarnovo was proclaimed Primate. In a letter to the Pope, Basil styled himself Patriarch, against which Innocent III did <b>not</b> <b>argue.</b> Just like Boris I (r. 852–889) three centuries earlier, Kaloyan pursued a strictly political agenda in his negotiations with the Papacy, without sincere intentions to convert to Roman Catholicism. The union with Rome lasted until 1235 and did not affect the Bulgarian church, which continued its practices of Eastern Orthodox canons and rites.|$|E
25|$|On 14 January 1908 at {{the annual}} College Colston society dinner George Alfred Wills {{rose to his feet}} and {{dramatically}} announced the news that his father, Henry Overton, was to donate £100,000 to the cause promoting the creation of the University providing that a Royal Charter was obtained within two years. Records note that the room began to cheer after the announcement was made. This announcement caused further funds to be promised by those attending the University. The day ended with the University endowment fund standing at five times greater than it had at the start with the University scheme attracting more in 24-hours than it did in its entire history. The raising of such large firms meant that the Privy Council could <b>not</b> <b>argue</b> that the creation of what were then disparagingly known as 'Lilliputian' Universities would in any way result in a decrease in the standard of British universities. H.O. Wills had little contact with the College apart from {{the fact that he had}} sent his son Harry to classes there. He died in 1911 after becoming the first Chancellor of the University of Bristol. The Wills Memorial Building was built by his two surviving sons in memory at a cost of £500,000. The impact of the Wills family upon the University can also be founding in the naming of the H.H. Wills Physics Laboratory built by George in memory of his brother which cost some £200,000 and the building of Wills Hall, a hall of residence for the University in Stoke Bishop. Unlike many of the supporters of the University the Wills were not Liberals or Quakers but Congregationalists.|$|E

500|$|One of Wollstonecraft's most scathing critiques in the Rights of Woman is {{of false}} and {{excessive}} sensibility, particularly in women.

In fact, she claims, they do harm not only to themselves but to the entire civilization: these are not women who can help refine a civilization—a popular eighteenth-century idea—but women who will destroy it.

He further specified that the landing gear remain deployed in the takeoff/landing position, the wing flaps be lowered 15degrees, and the cabin remain unpressurized. Copilot William Rataczak informed Cooper that the aircraft's range was limited to approximately [...] under the specified flight configuration, which meant that a second refueling would be necessary before entering Mexico. Cooper and the crew discussed options and agreed on Reno, Nevada, as the refueling stop. Finally, Cooper directed that the plane take off with the rear exit door open and its staircase extended. Northwest's home office objected, on grounds that it was unsafe to take off with the aft staircase deployed. Cooper countered that it was indeed safe, but he would <b>not</b> <b>argue</b> the point; he would lower it himself once they were airborne.|$|E
500|$|Between June and December 1860, Benjamin {{was almost}} entirely {{absorbed in the}} case of United States v. Castillero, that was tried in San Francisco during the latter part of that period. The case {{concerned}} a land grant by the former Mexican government of California. Castillero had leased part of his land to British mining companies, and when American authorities ruled the grant invalid, they hired Benjamin; he spent four months in San Francisco working on the case. The trial began in October, and Benjamin gave an address lasting six days. The local correspondent for the New York Times wrote that Benjamin, [...] "a distinguished stranger", drew the largest crowds to the courtroom and [...] "the Senator is making this terribly tedious case interesting". Benjamin sailed for New York once the case was submitted for decision in early November. The court's ruling, rendered in January 1861, was substantially for the company but, not satisfied, it appealed. It lost the case entirely to an adverse decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, three justices dissenting, the following year. [...] Benjamin was by then a Confederate Cabinet officer, and could <b>not</b> <b>argue</b> the case. His co-counsel filed his brief with the court.|$|E
500|$|Manga and anime {{publications}} praised Lenalee's {{character and}} {{her role in}} the series. While noting how the initial story arcs followed Allen's mission with other characters including Lenalee, Joy Kim of Manga Life found the introduction of her character appealing as it provided comedic momments to balance the bittersweet ending of the series' previous story arc. Nevertheless, Kim complained about Viz Media's multiple misspellings of Lenalee's name in the manga's third volume. Kevin Leathers of the UK Anime Network referred to her as [...] "the typical female influence" [...] because of the contrast she provides with other characters from D.Gray-man like Yu Kanda. The Fandom Post's John Rose found her more sympathetic than Allen's previous ally, Kanda, which helped him enjoy the story more. He credited her character's introduction with helping the manga to develop. Manga News agreed, finding Lenalee one of the more enjoyable characters introduced in the series. Leah Sacks of Comic Bulletin enjoyed Lenalee and Allen's relationship because of their similarities and because they do <b>not</b> <b>argue</b> unlike Allen's relationship with Kanda. Capsule Monsters' Michael Marr enjoyed Lenalee and the series' other supporting characters' roles because of their impact on Allen.|$|E
