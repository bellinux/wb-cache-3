40|$|<b>Medicinal</b> <b>leeches</b> (Hirudo medicinalis) are an {{important}} therapeutic modality in plastic and reconstructive surgery. Leeches are used for salvage of tissue flaps, grafts, or replants when venous congestion threatens tissue viability. Leeches facilitate passive bleeding at each attachment site thereby promoting increased perfusion and decreased microvascular congestion and obstruction. Furthermore, venous congestion is reduced secondary to the anticoagulant effect of the leech saliva, which contains apyrase, collagenase, hyaluronidase, factor Xa inhibitor, fibrinase, and the direct thrombin inhibi-tor hirudin. 1, 2 Current evidence suggests that flap survival is increased, in some instances up to 60 to 80 %, {{with the use of}} <b>medicinal</b> <b>leeches.</b> 1, 3, 4 The application of <b>medicinal</b> <b>leech</b> therapy is not devoid of risk.

40|$|After a short {{introduction}} to the classification of <b>medicinal</b> <b>leeches,</b> their historical use in phlebotomy (blood-letting) and contemporary use in neurobiology and medicine are summarised.

The limited information on the quantitative ecology of European <b>medicinal</b> <b>leeches</b> is summarised next.

40|$|Does the <b>medicinal</b> <b>leech</b> Hirudo medicinalis {{feel well}} in the Netherlands (Hirudinea) ? This paper {{provides}} information on the <b>medicinal</b> <b>leech</b> Hirudo medicinalis Linnaeus, 1758 particularly in The Netherlands. Although this species was common in The Netherlands in the 18 th century, nowadays it is very rare. Most animals were found in waters on sandy soil (71 %) : dune pools (10 %) and pleistocene sandy areas (61 %), where it inhabits especially soft water moor and heathland pools. About 20 % of the records originate from river areas, where the species {{can be found in}} breakthrough ponds and oxbow lakes. Only 9 % of the records are from fen and clay areas. Records of single specimens are not proof of an established population, because these specimens could also have survived after dispersal by waterfowl. Ten populations are currently known in The Netherlands. The leech is an indicator of special conditions such as high temperatures (shallow water), aerobic soil (e. g. sand for egg development) as well as of high biodiversity (feeding on snails, fish, amphibians, water birds and mammals). The <b>medicinal</b> <b>leech</b> is therefore threatened in The Netherlands by acidification, eutrophication and desiccation of their typical water biotopes causing an elimination of their vital prey (snails, fish and amphibians). Also the changed land use in agriculture is not favourable for the <b>medicinal</b> <b>leech.</b> In the past there were many drinking pools for cattle; nowadays drinking pools are very scarce and replaced by automated drinking systems. Management to restore the typical biotopes of the <b>medicinal</b> <b>leech</b> will further favour the presence of a lot of other species considered important to nature conservancy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Reconstructive {{microsurgery}} {{is performed}} to reattach, transfer, or transplant body tissues.

Results indicated that the use of the device resulted in significant increases in blood retrieval relative to reports of passive bleeding alone (141 %, 156 %, and 155 % in 1, 2, and 3 hours, respectively).

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Medicinal</b> <b>leeches</b> became infamous {{for their}} utility in bloodletting popularized in the 19 th century, and {{have seen a}} recent {{resurgence}} in post-operative treatments for flap and replantation surgeries, {{and in terms of}} characterization of salivary anticoagulants. Notorious throughout the world, the quintessential leech family Hirudinidae has been taken for granted to be monophyletic, as has the non-bloodfeeding family Haemopidae. Results This study is the first to evaluate molecular evidence from hirudinid and haemopid leeches in a manner that encompasses the global scope of their taxonomic distributions. We evaluated the presumed monophyly of the Hirudinidae and assessed previous well-accepted classification schemes. The Hirudinidae were found not to be monophyletic, falling instead into two distinct and unrelated clades. Members of the non-bloodfeeding family Haemopidae were scattered throughout the tree and among traditional hirudinid genera. A combination of nuclear 18 S rDNA and 28 S rDNA with mitochondrial 12 S rDNA and cytochrome c oxidase I were analyzed with Parsimony and with Bayesian methods. Conclusion The family Hirudinidae must be refined to include only the clade containing Hirudo medicinalis (European <b>medicinal</b> <b>leech)</b> and related leeches irrespective of bloodfeeding behavior. A second clade containing Macrobdella decora (North American <b>medicinal</b> <b>leech)</b> and its relatives may yet be recognized in Semiscolecidae in order to avoid paraphyly. The African distribution of species from each of the divergent hirudinid clades suggests that a deep divergence took place {{in the history of the}} <b>medicinal</b> <b>leeches</b> hundreds of millions of years ago. </p...|$|R
