The <b>new</b> <b>code</b> uses Gold sequences for time spreading, {{in place of}} Barker sequences in our previously proposed bipolar-bipolar <b>code.</b> The <b>new</b> <b>code</b> has a cardinality of N+ 1 {{times greater than the}} original code, because there exist N + 2 Gold sequences, but only one Barker sequence, for a given code length N. Since the <b>new</b> <b>code</b> is modified from the original code, there is no increase in hardware complexity. The average performance of the <b>new</b> <b>code</b> is analyzed and found very close to that of the original code. In other words, the <b>new</b> <b>code</b> can support greater cardinality without worsening average performance or increasing hardware complexity...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a <b>new</b> image <b>coding</b> using wavelet transform and adaptive block truncation coding. Images are first pre-processed by the wavelet transform and then coded by the adaptive block truncation coding. Algorithms for both monochrome and color images are proposed and experimentally studied. The adaptive block truncation coding is also modified to achieve better performance. For coding monochrome images at the bit-rate region between 0. 8 to 1. 2 bits/pixel, {{the performance of}} the <b>new</b> <b>coding</b> is comparable to the ones of subband codings and other image codings using the wavelet transform; however, the <b>new</b> <b>coding</b> offers less computational load. The <b>new</b> <b>coding</b> also gives a good reconstruction of a color image at the bit-rate of 1. 0 bit/pixel. The comparison between the <b>new</b> <b>coding</b> and the original adaptive block truncation coding is also given. The discussion on effects of a filter and a number of decomposition levels used for an implementation of the wavelet transform is included in this thesis, as well...|$|R
