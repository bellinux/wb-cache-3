The denial was based on quantum electrodynamics and proved that the quantum 1/f <b>noise</b> <b>effect</b> does not exist and its theoretical model is incorrect. In the quantum 1/f noise model, the photons and their vacuum states were omitted from the equations and such errors yielded faulty mathematical predictions for fluctuations that cannot exist because they are forbidden by the basic orthogonality rules of quantum electrodynamics.|$|E

Shortly thereafter an independent set of arguments showing that the [...] "quantum 1/f noise" [...] explanation of electronic 1/f noise was certainly incorrect was included in a standard review article on 1/f noise by Michael Weissman. Nieuwenhuizen, et al., state in the conclusion of their paper, [...] "As the theoretical basis for Handel’s quantum theory of 1/f noise appears to be lacking, we must conclude that the agreement with experiments is fortuituous" [...] and, in this way, they are indicating {{that some of the}} published experimental results are suspicious. Though there have been attempts to answer some of the objections to Handel's theory, quantum 1/f noise {{is considered to be a}} non-existent effect by the majority of scientists that are familiar with its theory. The difficulty is that here a judgment based on fundamental science requires the knowledge of quantum electrodynamics however most of noise scientists are solid state physicists or engineers.

The opinion of the above-mentioned relevant experts in the field of noise is that, until the publication rate on the non-existent quantum 1/f <b>noise</b> <b>effect</b> stays around 1 paper/year, it is more economical to refer to the old denials than to write up new refusals.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved {{version of a}} spectral normalisation based method for extraction of speech robust features in additive noise. The baseline normalisation method was developed by taking into consideration that, while the speech regions with less energy need more robustness, since in these regions the noise is more dominant, the “peaked ” spectral regions which are the most reliable due to the higher speech energy must also be preserved {{as much as possible}} by the feature extraction process. The additive <b>noise</b> <b>effect</b> tends to flatten the “peaked” spectral zones while the spectral zones of less energy are usually raised. The algorithm proposed in this paper showed to alleviate the <b>noise</b> <b>effect</b> by emphasising the voiced nature of the speech signal by raising the spectral “peaks”, which are “flatten ” by the <b>noise</b> <b>effect.</b> The clean speech database is assumed as lightly contaminated, the additive noise is estimated in a frame by frame basis and then used to restore both the “peaked ” and the flat spectral zones of the speech spectrum. 1...|$|E
