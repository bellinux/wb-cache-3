25|$|As well as {{degradation}} of the dye, failure of a CD-R can {{be due to the}} reflective surface. While silver is less expensive and more widely used, it is more prone to oxidation resulting in a <b>non-reflecting</b> <b>surface.</b> Gold on the other hand, although more expensive and no longer widely used, is an inert material, so gold-based CD-Rs do not suffer from this problem. Manufacturers have estimated the longevity of gold-based CD-Rs to be as high as 100 years.|$|E
50|$|A {{pellicle}} mirror (diminutive of pellis, a skin or film) is an ultra-thin, ultra-lightweight semi-transparent mirror {{employed in}} the light path of an optical instrument, splitting the light beam into two separate beams, both of reduced light intensity. Splitting the beam allows its use for multiple purposes simultaneously. The thinness of the mirror practically eliminates beam or image doubling due to a non-coincident weak second reflection from the nominally <b>non-reflecting</b> <b>surface,</b> a problem with mirror-type beam splitters.|$|E

40|$|The {{solution}} of diffraction problems on bounded net-shaped structures is {{the aim of}} the paper as well as the investigation of the propagation of electromagnetic waves in laminated composition media. As a result amplitudes and conditions of the origin of boundary and surface waves, excited by net-shaped screens, have been determined. Methods for the calculation of fields in composition materials with inclusions in the form of kiral and omega-particles have been developed. Aspects of the application of net-shaped screens instead of continuous metallic screens for the {{solution of}} problems of magnetic compatibility have been considered. Recommendations for the creation of <b>non-reflecting</b> <b>surfaces</b> from composition materials have been suggestedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{experimental}} {{procedure to}} measure the surface-near distribution of atmospheric trace gases using passive Multi-Axis-Differential Absorption Optical Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) is proposed. The idea consists of pointing the receiving telescope of the spectrometer to <b>non-reflecting</b> <b>surfaces</b> or to ‘bright’ targets placed at known distances from the measuring device, which are illuminated by sunlight. We show that the partial trace gas absorptions between {{the top of the}} atmosphere and the target can be easily removed from the measured total absorption. Thus it is possible to derive the average concentration of trace gases like e. g. NO 2, HCHO, SO 2, H 2 O, Glyoxal, BrO and others along the line of sight between the instrument and the target like for the well-known long-path DOAS observations (but with much less expense). If tomographic arrangements are used, even two- or three-dimensional trace gas distributions can be retrieved. The basic assumptions of the proposed method are confirmed by test measurements across the city of Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{more efficient}} algorithm {{used to detect}} the finger stroke of a projected keyboard layout on any flat <b>non-reflecting</b> <b>surface.</b> The virtual keyboard consist of variable intensity projector for projecting keyboard layout, a Camera with infra-red filter for capturing only infra-red wavelength light reflected objects, an infra-red Diode for object detection, photo-diode with simplified circuitry to on-off the key stroke detection and key board layout projection. The camera used is connected to PC or laptop with a wireless connection operating at 2. 4 GHz frequency of IEEE standard. An image processing algorithm is designed in open source to extract the keystroke {{on the surface and}} display the exact key on the screen. The integration of components with the software that is designed to run on any Operating system with even lower level of processor gives expected keystroke. Comparison algorithm calculates and checks the nearest value suitable for key injection to the system API. Height of device made has been kept as low as possible so that it does not interrupt the view of display screen of laptop or PC. Present work can be more upgraded with more gesture based feature that controls the virtual keyboard device and making the extra surface for virtual mouse option...|$|E
30|$|Due to {{the sample}} holder capacity, sample {{dimensions}} {{were limited to}} planar films of 18 × 13  mm 2 surface and 2  mm thickness. In these experiments, 0.5  mm thick films of phosphor mixed in a two-part optical silicone optical encapsulant were used. Thicker samples were not made {{in order to avoid}} light losses in the DIS system [13]. As the thickness of the sample increases, more light is likely to leave from the edges of the sample and get lost by hitting <b>non-reflecting</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In addition, the radial path lengths are nearly a factor of four greater in a 2  mm sample compared to a 0.5  mm sample, and photons will encounter four times more scattering events, enhancing the probability of light losses. To prepare the films, a silicone (n[*]=[*] 1.41 @ 450  nm) was mixed with different phosphor powders. Once the phosphor added, the mixture was well mixed and homogenized. Then, the phosphor/silicone mixture was degased in a vacuum oven at ambient temperature for 15 – 20  min. When all air bubbles were eliminated, the mixture was dispensed between glass slides. After 10  min curing at 150 °C, the phosphor/silicone film was carefully removed from the slides.|$|R
