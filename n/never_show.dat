5|$|Horner did {{not perform}} an exact {{cladistic}} analysis determining {{the relationship between the}} three populations. Such an analysis calculates which evolutionary tree implies the lowest number of evolutionary changes and therefore is the most likely. He assumed that this would result in a tree in which the types were successive branches. Such a tree would, {{as a consequence of the}} method used, <b>never</b> <b>show</b> a direct ancestor-descendant relationship. Many scientists believed such a relation could never be proven anyway. Horner disagreed: he saw the gradual morphological changes as clear proof that, in this case, the evolution of one taxon into another, without a splitting of the populations, could be directly observed. Evolutionists in general would be too hesitant to recognize this. Such a transition is called anagenesis; he posited that, if the opposite, cladogenesis, could not be proven, a scientist was free to assume an anagenetic process.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{arachnoid}} cysts may <b>never</b> <b>show</b> symptoms, even in {{some cases}} where the cyst is large. Therefore, while the presence of symptoms may provoke further clinical investigation, symptoms independent of further data cannot—and should not—be interpreted as evidence of a cyst's existence, size, location, or potential functional impact on the patient.|$|E
25|$|Angiography, {{since the}} 1960s, {{has been the}} {{traditional}} way of evaluating for atheroma. However, angiography is only motion or still images of dye mixed with the blood with the arterial lumen and <b>never</b> <b>show</b> atheroma; the wall of arteries, including atheroma with the arterial wall remain invisible. The limited exception to this rule is that with very advanced atheroma, with extensive calcification within the wall, a halo-like ring of radiodensity {{can be seen in}} most older humans, especially when arterial lumens are visualized end-on. On cine-floro, cardiologists and radiologists typically look for these calcification shadows to recognize arteries before they inject any contrast agent during angiograms.|$|E

25|$|Illustrations of {{theatrical}} masks from 5th century display helmet-like masks, covering the entire face and head, with holes {{for the eyes}} and a small aperture for the mouth, {{as well as an}} integrated wig. These paintings <b>never</b> <b>show</b> actual masks on the actors in performance; they are most often shown being handled by the actors before or after a performance, that liminal space between the audience and the stage, between myth and reality. This demonstrates {{the way in which the}} mask was to 'melt' into the face and allow the actor to vanish into the role. Effectively, the mask transformed the actor as much as memorization of the text. Therefore, performance in ancient Greece did not distinguish the masked actor from the theatrical character.|$|E
25|$|In {{the pilot}} episode, {{and for the}} first season, Crockett pilots a Chris Craft Stinger 390 X - a 39-foot deep-v {{offshore}} racing boat. According to T. Rafael Cimino, marine director for Miami Vice, a total of five Stinger 390 Xs were used on the show. A white 390 X was selected for the pilot episode as it would show up better for the night scenes. For the other four Stingers, Chris-Craft showed the production crew a colour scheme that included the red - however, since Michael Mann decided that the colour red was to <b>never</b> <b>show</b> up on the show so a blue colour scheme was instead chosen. The Stingers used on the show were not free from Chris-Craft. In fact, the boats had some serious warranty issues. These issues caused the production team to switch to using Wellcraft 38 Scarab KVs {{for the remainder of the}} show. The Scarab 38 KVs were a 28-hued, twin 440-hp boat that sold for $130,000 in 1986.|$|E
25|$|Assisted by Lucifer, {{ruler of}} the demons who loves Alexiel, Rosiel unseals the Tower of Etenamenki, where God rests, with Alexiel's body. Intent on {{restoring}} the Earth, Setsuna follows him, with Kurai and the archangels of fire and earth; along the way, he aids an injured Katan, who hopes to save Rosiel before he loses his free will to do so. At the tower, Rosiel kills Katan, only {{to realize that he}} had killed the one he loved and tried to protect from himself; he then goes into a state of destructive despair. Awakening in her own body with Setsuna's help, Alexiel reveals to him that she had always loved him: because he had been born the opposite of his healthy sister, she bargained with God to save his life in exchange for her imprisonment, from which she later escaped with Lucifer, and an agreement to <b>never</b> <b>show</b> him any compassion. She then kills him, and absorbs him into her womb so that they will never be apart again. Before dying, Rosiel passes along his power to Setsuna.|$|E

500|$|The Beatles met Kirchherr {{again in}} Hamburg in 1966 {{when they were}} touring Germany, and Kirchherr gave Lennon the letters he had written to Sutcliffe in 1961 and 1962. Lennon said it was [...] "the best present I've had in years". All of the Beatles wrote many letters to Kirchherr: [...] "I only have a couple from George , which I'll <b>never</b> <b>show</b> anyone, but he wrote so many. So did the others. I {{probably}} threw them away. You do that when you're young – you don't think of the future." [...] Harrison later asked Kirchherr to arrange the cover of his Wonderwall Music album in 1968.|$|E
500|$|During the 15th century, Vlad III ("Dracula"), Prince of Wallachia, is {{credited}} {{as the first}} notable figure to prefer this method of execution during the late medieval period, and became so notorious for its liberal employment that among his several nicknames {{he was known as}} Vlad the Impaler. After being orphaned, betrayed, forced into exile and pursued by his enemies, he retook control of Wallachia in 1456. He dealt harshly with his enemies, especially those who had betrayed his family in the past, or had profited from the misfortunes of Wallachia. Though a variety of methods was employed, he has been most associated with his use of impalement. The liberal use of capital punishment was eventually extended to Saxon settlers, members of a rival clan, and criminals in his domain, whether they were members of the boyar nobility or peasants, and eventually to any among his subjects that displeased him. Following the multiple campaigns against the invading Ottoman Turks, Vlad would <b>never</b> <b>show</b> mercy to his prisoners of war. After The Night Attack of Vlad Ţepeş in mid-June 1462 failed to assassinate the Ottoman sultan, the road to Târgovişte, the capital of Vlad's principality of Wallachia, eventually became inundated in a [...] "forest" [...] of 20,000 impaled and decaying corpses, and it is reported that Mehmet II's invading army of Turks turned back to Constantinople in 1462 after encountering thousands of impaled corpses along the Danube River. Woodblock prints from the era portray his victims impaled from either the frontal or the dorsal aspect, but not vertically.|$|E

500|$|Although his {{appearance}} {{as a domestic}} pet is mostly a cover, Perry has nonetheless expressed care and devotion for the Flynn-Fletcher family. In the episode [...] "The Ballad of Bad Beard", Perry managed to drag Candace out of the Dark Cave before it caved in because of Dr. Doofenshmirthz's [...] "self destruction button" [...] that which Candace had accidentally pressed while under the orange moss hallucination, thinking it was a vending machine. He did this {{even though he knew}} that Candace saw that Perry was a secret agent talking to Agent E (Eagle) and to Major Monogram in a cracked egg. Candace thought she was just hallucinating because of the orange moss she accidentally touched earlier in the episode. Also, when an invention of Doofenshmirtz's in the episode [...] "Journey to the Center of Candace" [...] might cause severe harm to Phineas and Ferb, Perry thoroughly beats up Doofenshmirtz and quickly handcuffs him. He then ties him to a pipe and, instead of just leaving him like he usually does in the series, calls for special forces from the O.W.C.A. to come and arrest the doctor, though they <b>never</b> <b>show</b> up. In [...] "Oh, There You Are, Perry," [...] Doofenshmirtz is downgraded to a low threat level and Perry is reassigned to a new nemesis. This causes him to have to leave his home with the Flynn-Fletchers, which makes him sad and he does not enjoy his new villain. Phineas and Ferb are fearful about where Perry could have gone to and put up several flyers around town for people to find him. They decide to throw a concert on the roof of a building, singing a song about how much they love Perry and want him to come home. Concurrently, Perry is reassigned to Doofenshmirtz again and returns to the brothers once more.|$|E

This amounted to several pages of hand-written notes that Fish apparently penned in the hours just prior to his death. When pressed by the assembled journalists to reveal the document's contents, Dempsey refused, stating, [...] "I will <b>never</b> <b>show</b> it to anyone.

2500|$|Entertainment Weekly named Studio 60 {{the worst}} TV show of 2006.

No comedians work that way. They go for the laughs first and the lesson second", and [...] " [...] is so dark, they could <b>never</b> <b>show</b> what actually happens there." ...|$|E

He disgraced himself and he disgraced British heavyweights, he shouldn't get paid the reported million pounds he is earning after that shambles." [...] European light-heavyweight champion Nathan Cleverly also voiced his discontent with the fight, adding Harrison should now retire. Due {{to the nature}} of Harrison's defeat, the BBBofC withheld some of the fighter's purse while a full investigation of the bout was carried out. After the investigation into the fight was concluded, Harrison was granted his full purse on 11 January 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Instrumental {{music was}} widespread, but {{relatively}} few notated examples have survived. [...] Indeed, while contemporary depictions of singers often show them performing from books or scrolls, paintings and miniatures of instrumentalists <b>never</b> <b>show</b> written music. The main keyboard collection is the Faenza Codex (Faenza, Biblioteca Comunale, ms. 117). [...] Other small sources of keyboard music appear in codices in Padua (Archivio di Stato 553), Assisi (Biblioteca Comunale 187), {{and in one}} section of the Reina Codex (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, n. a. fr. 6771). [...] The typical keyboard style of the time seems to have placed the tenor of a secular song or a melody from plainchant in equal tones in the bass while a fast-moving line was written above it for the right hand. [...] The surviving sources are likely among the few witnesses of a largely improvised tradition.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl" [...] condemns male chauvinism by {{addressing}} hurtful myths about female inferiority, with Madonna commenting on female role-playing in society.

The Village Voices Phil Dellio found the song [...] "the perfect answer record to The Virgin Suicides (where boys indeed stand {{on the side of}} the street looking uncomprehendingly on girls), thanks in no small part to the gossamer-like synthesizer percolating in the background.
