5000|$|<b>Naphthol</b> <b>Red</b> (Pigment red 170 or PR170) is {{an organic}} pigment {{extensively}} used in automotive coatings and painting.|$|E
30|$|Similarly, the {{naphthol}} reds {{that appeared}} from 1889 {{were used in}} mixture with vermilion in several cases. This {{seems to have been}} a common practice in the production of lithographic inks, where it was most likely added to increase the opacity of the ink [37]. Mixtures of <b>naphthol</b> <b>red</b> and eosin, sometimes with vermilion added, were also detected in our study, through the combination of XRF, micro-Raman and SERS analysis.|$|E
30|$|Another <b>naphthol</b> <b>red,</b> {{brilliant}} scarlet (acid red 18), {{was detected}} {{for the first}} time in a print dated 1895. Like ponceau 2 R, brilliant scarlet is a β-naphthol colorants belonging to the mono-azo group, synthetized {{for the first time}} by Baum in 1878. The Raman spectrum of brilliant scarlet obtained from a print produced in 1897 is shown in Fig.  5 B-a. Signals of brilliant scarlet (Fig.  5 B-c) were detected at 500  w, 694  w, 942  m, 1238 vs, 1342  w, 1361 vs, 1399  vw, 1421  vw, 1439  m, 1457  m, 1512  s, 1571 vs, 1590  m cm− 1 [33].|$|E
30|$|<b>Naphthol</b> <b>reds</b> give {{a bright}} red hue. Because of their high {{solubility}} in water they bleed through the paper (and the backing, if any), and are characteristically visible {{on the back of}} the prints, as can be clearly seen in Fig.  5 C. They were adopted in Japan about 10  years after they had become available on the Western market.|$|R
30|$|Shortly afterwards, {{the first}} azoic dyes and {{pigments}} appeared on the market. In the early 20 th century, the production began of β-naphthol pigment lakes, BON pigment lakes, Hansa Yellows, pyrazolones, diarylides, and <b>Naphthol</b> <b>Reds.</b> The history of synthetic organic pigments discovered and produced in the 19 th– 20 th centuries have been reviewed by de Keijzer [10], and all the different classes of industrial organic pigments are discussed in detail in [3].|$|R
30|$|In {{the second}} half of 1889 a new class of red {{synthetic}} colorants makes its appearance on the Japanese market: <b>naphthol</b> <b>reds,</b> which suddenly replaced carmine. The naphthol colorant Ponceau 2 R (acid red 26) was found on a print dated mid- 1889. Ponceau 2 R is a mono-azo β-naphthol colorant, discovered by H. Baum in 1878. It can be identified by its characteristic Raman peaks at 474  m, 491  sh, 745  vw, 939  m, 1133  vw, 1245 vs, 1341  s, 1380 w, 1493  m, 1582  w and 1610  m cm− 1 [33].|$|R
40|$|The {{adsorption}} of {{acid dye}} (Amido <b>Naphthol</b> <b>Red</b> G, AR 1) onto hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA) chloride modified montmorillonite and basic dye (Basic Violet 10, BV 10) onto MCM- 41 was studied {{to examine the}} potential of organoclay and MCM- 41 {{for the removal of}} acid and basic dye from wastewater. The revolutions of surface and pore structure of montmorillonite induced by surfactant modified process were characterized based on the analyses of the nitrogen isotherms as well as the X-ray diffraction patterns. The zeta potentials of organoclay and MCM- 41 were also measured {{to examine the effects of}} pH on the surface charge of the two adsorbents. It was found that because the hydrophobic tails interaction of HDTMA ions could render a positive charge development on montmorillonite surface, which in turn resulted in an ion-exchange mechanism with the replacement of counterion of the surfactant by acid dye, organoclay might be a good adsorbent for the removal of acid dye pollutants. On the other hand, because the large pore-space of MCM- 41 and the strong interactions between the large basic dyes and the surface hydroxyl groups of MCM- 41, MCM- 41 was an attractive adsorbent for the removal of basic dye. The adsorption of AR 1 on organoclay and BV 10 on MCM- 41 with respect to contact time, pH, and temperature was then measured to provide more information about the adsorption characteristics of organoclay and MCM- 41. Strong alkaline or acid solution was favorable (not favorable) for the adsorption of AR 1 on organoclay (BV 10 on MCM- 41). Both Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models were applied to describe the equilibrium isotherms and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was used to describe the kinetic data, from which some adsorption thermodynamic parameters were evaluated and adsorption mechanism were also discussed...|$|E
30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that among the various {{commercial}} names used for these three naphthol compounds, many contain the term ‘scarlet’, as reported in the Colour Index [11]. Sukaretto, the Japanese transliteration of ‘scarlet’, has been attested in an article published in 1890 on the newspaper Yomiuri shinbun, in which the author laments the drop in the quality of woodblock printing caused by the introduction of the new synthetic colorants [34]. In 1894 the same word is recorded by Koizumi Eijirō, who describes it as “a red dye made of naphthol (nafusōru), with truly many varieties, of which here are a few with their names and chemical formulas” [35]. Naphthol reds were also very common inks in the early phases of chromolithography (ca. 1890 – 1920) [36 – 38]. In lithographic inks the colorant is usually mixed with a ‘varnish’ and several additives to improve the overall quality of the material. The strong fluorescent background which characterizes the Raman spectra of the naphthol reds collected from the prints, {{as can be seen in}} Fig.  5 A-a and B-a, could be ascribed to the intrinsic complexity of the ink mixture [32, 36, 37]. Furthermore, the consistent detection of Ba in the XRF analysis in the area where <b>naphthol</b> <b>red</b> was detected by micro-Raman points to the use of barium white (BaSO 4), a common ingredient of lithographic inks as an extender or as a substrate of the lake pigment, as attested in the past [37]. Barium is most likely to be present as BaSO 4, used as extender, since the high sensitivity to water of the red areas points toward the use of the material as a free colorant instead of the lake pigment. The presence of the Raman peak of barite, at around 987  cm− 1, in some prints seems to confirm this hypothesis. Since barium white is an inexpensive pigment and produces inferior extenders, it was sometime used in cheaper grades of ink. It was also used in gloss white, a 25 % alumina hydrate— 75 % BaSO 4 mixture, which produces a semi-opaque extender [36].|$|E
40|$|An {{immunological}} {{technique for}} detecting Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydia psittaci inclusions in infected McCoy cell cultures {{was developed by}} using a genus-specific monoclonal antibody to Chlamydia spp., rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin G bridging antibody, alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) monoclonal antibody conjugate, and <b>naphthol</b> AS-phosphate/fast <b>red</b> substrate. Chlamydial inclusions stained red and were easily detected {{against a background of}} blue hematoxylin-stained nuclei. After 18 h, inclusions of C. trachomatis serovar L 2 LGV 434 /Bu and C. psittaci strain 6 BC were stained by APAAP but not by iodine or Giemsa. At 48 h inclusion counts were significantly higher in the APAAP cultures. Both the APAAP procedure and conventional staining detected 35 of 239 (15 %) cultures 48 h after inoculation with urethral or endocervical specimens. However, at 24 h after inoculation 22 of 35 (63 %) were positive by APAAP staining while negative by iodine. This immunostain also allowed identification of chlamydial inclusions in endometrial biopsies from patients with tubal factor infertility or pelvic inflammatory disease...|$|R
30|$|A {{widespread}} belief among {{scholars and}} connoisseurs of the Japanese color woodblock print (nishiki-e) holds that synthetic dyes were {{imported from the}} West in the 1860 s, and soon came {{to be used for}} all nishiki-e colorants during the Meiji period. These “cheap imported aniline dyes” are widely described as “gaudy”, “garish”, and “strident”, and thought to stand in sharp contrast to more muted “natural” colorants that preceded them. This study calls this narrative into question through an analysis of the colorants of nishiki-e from 1860 until 1900, using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy coupled with micro-Raman, XRF and fiber optic reflectance spectroscopies. The results show that the introduction of synthetic dyes was gradual and selective, and that most of the customary colorants of the late Edo period continued in use. The results revealed a series of key turning points after 1860 : (1) In 1864, the purple dye rosaniline became the first synthetic dye to be used in nishiki-e, at first in combination with Prussian blue for a more bluish color. From 1875, it was usually mixed or replaced with methyl violet for a stronger purple. (2) In early 1869, a dramatic and until recently unrecognized transition took place, from the longstanding use of safflower as the dominant red, to its total replacement by imported cochineal carmine. Carmine remained the primary red for the next two decades, often combined with vermillion. (3) In 1877, eosine appeared as the first synthetic red dye in nishiki-e, used alone for pink, and in mixture with carmine for red. (4) Finally, from 1889, a succession of <b>red</b> <b>naphthol</b> dyes of more striking color appeared. Just about this time, however, a tendency to more restrained use of color and more painterly effects began to emerge in nishiki-e, and {{with the exception of a}} burst of dynamic color in prints depicting the Sino–Japanese War (1894 – 95), the uses of strong colors in Meiji prints receded. A final key finding is that colorants were often combined, either through mixture in a bowl or on the printing block, or by two-step overprinting.|$|R
