40|$|The Gochi net is {{commonly}} operated off {{the west coast}} of Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. Its construction can be divided into two types; with and without a bag. The net without a bag is operated in areas with a rough bottom and complicate configuration. In operating this net, factors which should be taken into consideration include the length of bottom contact, minimum distance between the net and artificial reef, and variation of net mouth. The net operation was analyzed through data from underwater camera and video, tension, depth, and <b>net</b> mouth <b>height</b> meters. The <b>net</b> mouth <b>height</b> at the time of bottom contact was 10 - 16 m. During hauling it decreased to 3 - 6 m. At the time of lift off the bottom, <b>net</b> mouth <b>height</b> ranged from 0. 5 - 1. 0 m. At this point, fishes were caught in the net. The tension during bottom contact was 10 - 20 kg. During hauling it increased to 25 - 50 kg. Upon lifting off it increased to 60 - 100 kg. Wing distance became narrow after lifting off the bottom. This caused schools of fishes which were in front of the net mouth to become frightened and entangled in the net bunt. Under operating conditions, the net mouth looked like a "tongue", and the phase of hauling like a scoop. Over all hauling rate of the net is shown to be 3 - 5 m/s, which were good condition of <b>net</b> mouth <b>height</b> when the fishes were caught in the front of net and over artificial reef area...|$|R

Nowadays eight players {{can play in}} a team four players play at back side and four {{at the center of}} court and one player stands in front of net. If any ball goes into net (called as 3rd ball or 'common ball'), the net man pushes it back to his team and the 'Defencer' (man which is standing in the right center) pushes it towards the back side players (3rd players) of the opponent team. And the players of 3rd hit it forcefully.|$|E

50|$|The {{choice of}} stroke {{depends on how}} near the {{shuttlecock}} is to the net, whether it is above <b>net</b> <b>height,</b> and where an opponent is currently positioned: players have much better attacking options if they can reach the shuttlecock well above <b>net</b> <b>height,</b> especially if it is also close to the net. In the forecourt, a high shuttlecock will be met with a net kill, hitting it steeply downwards and attempting to win the rally immediately. This {{is why it is}} best to drop the shuttlecock just over the net in this situation. In the midcourt, a high shuttlecock will usually be met with a powerful smash, also hitting downwards and hoping for an outright winner or a weak reply. Athletic jump smashes, where players jump upwards for a steeper smash angle, are a common and spectacular element of elite men's doubles play. In the rearcourt, players strive to hit the shuttlecock while it is still above them, rather than allowing it to drop lower. This overhead hitting allows them to play smashes, clears (hitting the shuttlecock high and {{to the back of the}} opponents' court), and drop shots (hitting the shuttlecock softly so that it falls sharply downwards into the opponents' forecourt). If the shuttlecock has dropped lower, then a smash is impossible and a full-length, high clear is difficult.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a general feasibility study on double rigged versus single rigged trawls. This study used model experimental nets {{tested in a}} circulating water tank. Three kinds of trawls were tested, i. e. the Mexican semi ballon double rigged shrimp trawl designed by Nichimo (hereafter called net A), the traditional two seam single rigged Malaysian shrimp trawl (net B) and the four seam trawl modified from the above Malaysian trawl (net C). The head rope length of net A is about half that of net B and net C. Primary objectives are to determine physical characteristics, working performance and to estimate the main engine output necessary to pull these nets. To provide a double rigged shrimp trawl in the Malaysian shrimp fisheries, results of experiments are summarised as follows: 1) At 2 knots, which is a normal towing speed of a Malaysian shrimp trawler, <b>net</b> mouth <b>height</b> of <b>net</b> A is 1. 2 meter, net B is 2 meter and net C is 1. 8 meter. In accordance to the behaviour of shrimp, these <b>net</b> mouth <b>height</b> are sufficient. 2) In order to ensure {{the security of the}} catch, the most efficient average mesh opening was determined to be five vertical cross-sections. The mesh opening is bigger at the square panel and becomes smaller towards the cod end. The opening is about 3 centimeter for 5. 7 centimeter mesh size. 3) The wing tip spread of net A is 11 meter, which is 80 % of its head rope length. Net B is 14 meter (55 %) and net C is 14. 4 meter (60 %). 4) The working performance of a shrimp trawl is determined by its sweeping area. The obtained experimental equations of the sweeping area of the three net are slimplified as follows: 2 net A: A's= 2. 18 Vnet B: A"s= 1. 57 Vnet C: A‴s= 1. 58 V 5) The estimation of suitable main engine output necessary to pull the net is calculated from the conversion of total gear drag force values to horse power values.

40|$|To obtain some {{fundamental}} suggestions on the gear-efficiency {{of the two}} different types of trawl net, the authors carried out the model experiment, and compared them with each other, basing on the physical characters of the net. The one is a six-seam net used on board of the 2 ̆ 7 Keiten Maru"" (854. 55 GT) for catching the demersal fishes: and here the otter board was rigged between the hand rope and the warp. The other one is shrimp trawl net used on board of the ""Satsunan"" (116. 57 GT) : and the otter board was directly rigged to the wing-tip in a traditional type. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows. (1) In ordinary towing condition, the <b>height</b> of the <b>net</b> mouth of the six-seam net and the shrimp trawl net, marked 3. 5 m and 1 m, respectively. In six-seam <b>net</b> the <b>height</b> of the <b>net</b> mouth (h) can be expressed in the following formula, h= (0. 15 - 0. 053 V) l. where l is maximum breadth of the net mouth without shrinkage in (m), and V is towing speed in (m/sec) when the distance between both wing-tips is about 30 m. In shrimp trawl <b>net,</b> the maximum <b>height</b> of the <b>net</b> mouth is limited by the otter board height. ""(2) The bag net and net shape of the six-seam net look like cigar-shaped and in shrimp trawl net it is conical shaped but short. These are concerned with the planning of the net design. (3) The net resistance of six-seam net is larger than that of shrimp trawl net. At ordinary towing condition the net resistance of six-seam net, marked in 3. 1 7. 0 ton. In shrimp trawl net it marked about 105 275 kg. This difference of the net resistance depends on the scale of each net. Considering from the net shape and other characteristics of net, the six-seam net with V-D type otter board seems to be suitable for catching the demersal fishes, and the shrimp trawl net with one directly rigged to the wing-tip seems to be suitable for shrimps. ...|$|R

The traditional natural light solution of having a large central hall, cutting through all the floors, with a glass roof, wasn't chosen either because that would take up too much (expensive) space. This means that almost all the light {{has to come from}} lamps. The outer wall (except for the two upper floors) is made of marble, interspaced with horizontal strips of lamps that are lit at night. This gives the building a very horizontal visual aspect. Here too, functionality was sought, with no unnecessary decoration, but without giving the building the 'cold' appearance that many new buildings of the time had. As with the Glaspaleis, the floors are supported by columns, interspaced 8 m, with the outer columns 2.5 m from the outer wall. The roof of the top floor is steel construction.

50|$|Outdoor cricket nets are the {{standard}} and {{most common form}} of practise nets. They take shape and form in many different guises, with some nets being homemade whilst others are professional manufactured and installed, and this is reflected throughout the world. Regardless of their design and construction, outdoor crickets all have the same purpose of allowing batting and bowling practise within an enclosed space where the ball is contained. The design and construction of outdoor cricket nets tends to be based around two factors; the frequency and age of those who will use it, and also the space which is available. In schools and cricket clubs where levels of use will be high the construction of the cricket cage will be tailored to suit these requirements. A further unfortunate consideration has to be made into the likelihood that the cricket nets will be subject to misuse or vandalism. Therefore, the frames of cricket cages are often constructed out of heavy duty galvanised steel with an overall diameter ranging from 34mm - 50mm, the steel tube is then joined by galvanised key-clamp brackets. This system requires ground sockets to be concreted into the ground, although these cannot be removed the actual frame of the cage can still be dismantled. There are variations in the design of outdoor nets such as a pulley and ratchet system where the net is mounted on a cable which spans posts located {{at either end of the}} practise net. Garden cricket nets are frequently DIY and quite often take the form of a professional design with locally sourced components. This occurs primarily due to cost implications, but also due to the fact cricket nets are fundamentally simple in design and purpose and thus greatly increase the feasibility of constructing a homemade cricket net. There are few rules of thumb to follow particularly with size. The width should be no less than 9 ft, with 12 ft being optimum. The height should be no less than 9 ft if the length of net is longer than 24 ft, this is increased to 10 ft up to a length of 36 ft and nets with roof lengths beyond 36 ft should have a <b>net</b> <b>height</b> of 12 ft - this is to prevent balls ending up on the roof of the cricket net after being bowled. The length of the net is flexible, however the longer the net the more ball containment and the safer the surround training area is. There is a further type of outdoor cricket nets, this is a mobile cricket net. A steel framed cricket cage can be adapted with wheels to allow them to be become completely portable.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of scaling court-size and <b>net</b> <b>height</b> on children’s tennis performance was examined. Sixteen boys (9. 7 ± 0. 5 years) had {{to perform a}} 30 -min match in four different conditions, where court-size and/or <b>net</b> <b>height</b> were scaled by using a scaling ratio based on the differences in temporal demands between {{the children and the}} adult game. These 30 -min matches were analysed using Tennis Analyst (FairPlay Ltd., Jindalee, QLD, Australia) software to determine typical tennis match performance characteristics. Children hit more winners, more forced errors, played more volleys, struck more shots from a comfortable height and played in a more forward court position when the net was scaled. Scaling both the court and net lead to a faster children’s game, more closely approximating what is typical of the adult game. The differences between the typical tennis performance variables recorded suggested that scaling the net led to a more aggressive way of playing. Further, children enjoyed playing on the standard court–scaled net condition more than standard adult conditions. It is suggested that optimising the scaling of <b>net</b> <b>height</b> may be as critical as other task constraints, such as racquet length or court-size, as it leads to a more engaging learning environment for experienced children...|$|E

Neste trabalho avaliou-se a produção de mudas de alface sob três tipos de tela de sombreamento, postas em quatro alturas em relação à sementeira, sob as condições de altas temperaturas e ampla luminosidade de Mossoró. O experimento foi conduzido em delineamento inteiramente casualizado em esquema de parcelas subdivididas com três repetições, com um tratamento adicional nas parcelas. O fator alocado às parcelas foi constituído pela cor da tela de sombreamento [branca, verde ou preta e uma testemunha sem tela (alface cultivada a céu aberto) ] e o outro alocado às subparcelas foi constituído pelas alturas das telas em relação ao nível do solo das sementeiras (20; 30; 40 e 50 cm).
