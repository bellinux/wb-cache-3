30|$|Pulque is a {{traditional}} alcoholic, <b>non-distilled,</b> <b>fermented</b> <b>beverage</b> produced by the fermentation of the sap known as aguamiel, extracted from several magueys (Agave) species such as A. salmiana, A. atrovirens and A. mapisaga. For its production, freshly collected aguamiel is transported to large open barrels where the fermentation takes place. The process is accelerated {{by the addition of}} a portion of previously produced pulque, and the fermentation time varies from a few hours to overnight, depending on whether the sap is collected at daybreak or dusk. The development of viscosity due to exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis, slight acidity and alcohol content are the main parameters used to determine the degree of fermentation. The process is static and performed under non-aseptic conditions; therefore, the populations of microorganisms involved in the fermentation are those naturally occurring during sap accumulation in maguey plants and those incorporated during collection, transport, inoculation and manipulation (Escalante et al. 2004, 2008, 2012; Lappe-Oliveras et al. 2008; Sanchez-Marroquin and Hope 1953).|$|R
30|$|Pulque is a {{traditional}} Mexican, <b>non-distilled</b> alcoholic <b>fermented</b> <b>beverage</b> currently produced and consumed mainly in the Central Mexico Plateau. It is obtained from the fermentation of a fresh sap, known as aguamiel, which is extracted from several maguey (Agave) species, such as Agave atrovensis and A. americana. The production of this traditional beverage requires for the freshly collected aguamiel to be deposited in large open containers where previously fermented pulque acts as seed for a new batch. Fermentation time varies from a few hours, overnight, or even for several days. Fermented pulque is gradually retired from the container but always leaving a residual volume of the <b>fermented</b> <b>beverage</b> {{to start a new}} fermentation. The viscosity resultant from EPS synthesis and the alcohol content of the beverage are the main parameters used {{to determine the extent of}} fermentation as they define its distinctive sensorial properties (Escalante et al. 2008; Escalante et al. 2012).|$|R
30|$|Pulque is a Mexican {{traditional}} alcoholic, <b>non-distilled,</b> <b>fermented</b> <b>beverage</b> {{produced by}} the fermentation of the sap, known as aguamiel, extracted from several maguey (Agave) species. Pulque has traditionally been considered a healthy beverage due to its nutrient content and also a traditional medicine {{for the treatment of}} gastrointestinal disorders and intestinal infections. During pulque fermentation, the development of acidity, alcohol and viscosity define its final sensorial properties, developing an enriched environment where dominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB), including diverse Leuconostoc species, are present. Because traditional pulque is consumed directly from the fermentation vessel, the naturally associated LAB are ingested and reach the human small intestine alive. Here, we report the in vitro and in vivo probiotic assessment of Leuconostoc mesenteroides strain P 45 isolated from pulque. This isolated LAB species exhibited lysozyme, acid (pH 3.5) and bile salts (0.1 and 0.3  % oxgall) resistance. Antibacterial activity against the pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium were observed in assays involving cell-to-cell contact, cell-free 2 × concentrated supernatants and cell-to-cell contact under exopolysaccharide-producing conditions. The in vivo probiotic assessment showed an anti-infective activity of L. mesenteroides P 45 against S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in challenged male and female BALB/c mice. Analysis of the available genome sequence of strain P 45 allowed identified a pre-bacteriocin coding gene and six peptidoglycan hydrolase enzymes, probably involved in the antimicrobial activity of this strain. The results presented in this study support some potential microbial mechanisms associated with the beneficial effects on human health of this LAB involved in the fermentation of pulque.|$|R

Additionally, it enhanced the antioxidant activity measured by the nitric oxide scavenging assay (14 % of E. camaldulensis and 49 % of L. glaucescens); whereas relevant improvements in the <b>fermented</b> <b>beverage</b> were not observed in the lipid oxidation assay compared with unfermented infusions. The same behaviour was observed in the inhibitory activity of ACE; however, both infusions and <b>fermented</b> <b>beverages</b> had lower IC 50 than positive control (captopril). The present study demonstrated that fermentation has an infl uence on the concentration of phenolics and their potential bioactivity.

30|$|We {{report the}} {{screening}} and characterization of EPS produced by LAB identified as Leuconostoc kimchii isolated from pulque, a traditional Mexican <b>fermented,</b> <b>non-distilled</b> alcoholic <b>beverage</b> {{produced by the}} fermentation of the sap extracted from several (Agave) maguey species. EPS-producing LAB constitutes an abundant bacterial group relative to total LAB present in sap and during fermentation, however, only two EPS-producing colony phenotypes (EPSA and EPSB, respectively) were detected and isolated concluding that despite {{the high number of}} polymer-producing LAB their phenotypic diversity is low. Scanning electron microcopy analysis during EPS-producing conditions revealed that both types of EPS form a uniform porous structure surrounding the bacterial cells. The structural characterization of the soluble and cell-associated EPS fractions of each polymer by enzymatic and acid hydrolysis, as by 1 D- and 2 D-NMR, showed that polymers produced by the soluble and cell-associated fractions of EPSA strain are dextrans consisting of a linear backbone of linked α-(1 → 6) Glcp in the main chain with α-(1 → 2) and α-(1 → 3)-linked branches. The polymer produced by the soluble fraction of EPSB strain was identified as a class 1 dextran with a linear backbone containing consecutive α-(1 → 6)-linked D-glucopyranosyl units with few α-(1 → 3)-linked branches, whereas the cell-associated EPS is a polymer mixture consisting of a levan composed of linear chains of (2 → 6)-linked β-D-fructofuranosyl residues with β-(2 → 6) connections, and a class 1 dextran. According to our knowledge this is the first report of dextrans and a levan including their structural characterization produced by L. kimchii isolated from a traditional fermented source.|$|R

30|$|Incidence of {{methanol}} {{contamination of}} traditionally <b>fermented</b> <b>beverages</b> is increasing globally {{resulting in the}} death of several persons. The source of methanol contamination has not been clearly established in most countries. While there were speculations that unscrupulous vendors might have deliberately spiked the beverages with methanol, {{it is more likely that}} the methanol might have been produced by contaminating microbes during traditional ethanol fermentation, which is often inoculated spontaneously by mixed microbes, with a potential to produce mixed alcohols. Methanol production in traditionally <b>fermented</b> <b>beverages</b> can be linked to the activities of pectinase producing yeast, fungi and bacteria. This study assessed some traditional <b>fermented</b> <b>beverages</b> and found that some beverages are prone to methanol contamination including cachaca, cholai, agave, arak, plum and grape wines. Possible microbial role in the production of methanol and other volatile congeners in these <b>fermented</b> <b>beverages</b> were discussed. The study concluded by suggesting that contaminated alcoholic beverages be converted for fuel use rather than out rightly banning the age—long traditional alcohol fermentation.|$|R

Vegetables being {{good source of}} vitamins and minerals, further their concentration has been improved by fermentation process. In recent years elderly institutions are being more common and a need for nutritional studies to provide better service. Thus {{the present study was}} conducted on geriatrics population to see the effect of ashgourd <b>fermented</b> <b>beverage</b> on anthropometric, nutritional and biochemical status of institutional elderly inmates. Ashgourd <b>Fermented</b> <b>beverage</b> (180 ml) was provided to inmates of experimental group with the instructions to drink in fasting condition as a first drink in the morning for 60 days and control group received no supplementation. The parameters which were selected to evaluate the effect of ashgourd <b>fermented</b> <b>beverage</b> were anthropometric data, nutritional status, dietary pattern, clinical, biochemical parameters such as fasting and post prandial blood glucose levels, lipid profile, haemoglobin level and medical histories of the inmates. The selected parameters were assessed before and after the supplementation to see the effect of <b>fermented</b> <b>beverage.</b> It can be concluded from the present study that supplementation of <b>fermented</b> <b>beverage</b> showed significant improvement in BMI grades, heamoglobin and reduced blood glucose level, triglycerides and improved HDL cholesterol levels in experimental group when compared with the control group...|$|R

30|$|Limitations of {{our study}} are small number of sample size, {{consumption}} of low amount of beverage, and utilization of fresh <b>fermented</b> <b>beverages.</b> Although our results are applied for 300  mL consumption, higher consumption levels could change blood alcohol and urine EtG and EtS concentration. Lutmer et al. (Lutmer et al. 2009) indicated {{that in order to}} obtain 20  mg/dL blood ethanol level, about 5 - 6  L energy drink, with similar ethanol concentration to <b>fermented</b> <b>beverages,</b> should be consumed. On the other hand, fermentation is an ongoing process that causes more ethanol formation especially if the process or/and storage time gets prolonged. We used fresh traditional <b>fermented</b> <b>beverages</b> in the presented study; however, it is possible that homemade or awaited beverages could have distinct ethanol concentrations which are likely to affect the blood alcohol results.|$|R
