5|$|Although {{partially}} blind from glaucoma {{by the age}} of 109 {{and completely}} blind from cataracts by 111, he nevertheless retained his memory and good health until his final days; his medical history showed no signs of high blood pressure, heart or kidney trouble or diabetes. He was able to walk without a cane or walker, preferring not to use one, and was able to feed himself, including Cheerios for breakfast, his favorite vanilla ice cream with his other meals and a daily can of Ensure for energy. While he enjoyed recounting tales from his military experience, he <b>never</b> <b>complained</b> about the segregated nature of his unit, preferring instead to focus on his own exploits on the job.|$|E
5|$|As a mother, Lady Rosebery was {{presented}} with a dilemma: she was in fact already practically a mother to her husband who had no great feeling for a proximity to small babies. This was particularly evident in June 1880 when shortly {{after the birth of}} their first child Sybil, Rosebery wished to visit Germany for three months, to take a cure at a German spa (he was recovering from what is now thought to have been a nervous breakdown). His wife dutifully accompanied him. However, Rosebery, clearly aware of his wife's frustrated maternal instincts, reported that Hannah savoured every detail of the daily letters from London concerning the baby, and that she <b>never</b> <b>complained</b> at the forced separation.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{prompting}} by {{the news}} media, Stilwell <b>never</b> <b>complained</b> about his treatment by Washington or by Chiang. He later served as Commander of Army Ground Forces, U.S. Tenth Army commander {{in the last few}} days of the Battle of Okinawa in 1945, and as U.S. Sixth Army commander after the war's conclusion.|$|E

25|$|Soon after World War II, {{problems}} with his eyes which had begun in 1941-2 led to Mead becoming totally blind, but he <b>never</b> <b>complained</b> about this. His financial worries were assuaged by a fund raised by Herbert Sutcliffe for Mead and Len Braund. He retained {{a great interest in}} cricket and often attended Hampshire matches at Dean Park right up to his death on 26 March 1958.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} the seminar with an excellent grade, Bruckner was sent as a teacher's assistant {{to a school}} in Windhaag. The living standards and pay were horrible, and Bruckner was constantly humiliated by his superior, teacher Franz Fuchs. Despite the difficult situation, Bruckner <b>never</b> <b>complained</b> or rebelled; a belief of inferiority was to remain one of Bruckner's main personal characteristics during his whole life. He would stay at Windhaag from age 17–19, teaching subjects {{that had nothing to}} do with music.|$|E
25|$|Halberstam's {{wife and}} ten of his {{children}} were murdered by the Nazis during World War II. His eldest son survived the war, but succumbed to illness in a nearby DP camp before his father even {{knew that he had}} survived. Yet Halberstam <b>never</b> <b>complained</b> of his lot, and avoided depression by reaching out to others. He spent much time listening to and comforting people of all ages, and brought hundreds of people back to religious observance through his passionate public speeches.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} said (by the present-day {{explorer}} Ranulph Fiennes amongst others) that Scott's team was appropriately dressed for man-hauling in their woolen and wind-proof clothing, and as Amundsen was skiing it was appropriate he wore furs. Skiing at the pace of a dog team is a strenuous activity. Yet Amundsen <b>never</b> <b>complained</b> about the clothing being too hot. That is because the furs are worn loosely so air circulates and sweat evaporates. Scott's team, on the other hand, made regular complaints about the cold.|$|E
25|$|Will Hutchins as Coley. As Gashade's dimwitted friend, Hutchins {{was cast}} in the same burst of {{inspiration}} that Hellman had when he also thought of Warren Oates and Millie Perkins for the other lead roles in the film. Like Oates, when The Shooting began production Hutchins was already fully identified with the western genre, having starred for several years in the ABC-TV television series Sugarfoot, which ran from 1957 to 1961. Both Perkins and Hellman later recalled the actor as being a funny and charming man who <b>never</b> <b>complained</b> about the often adverse filming conditions.|$|E
25|$|Killam {{moved with}} his family, {{wife and three}} children, to Laredo in 1920, when Radcliffe was ten years of age. His father had come to south Texas to {{prospect}} for petroleum and natural gas on mineral leases that he had acquired while in business in Oklahoma. The third Killam well brought about an oil boom in Mirando City in eastern Webb County in 1921, nearly a decade before the better known East Texas Oil Boom centered about Kilgore. Killam {{grew up in the}} oil fields and spent his summers on the rigs. He graduated in 1932 from Laredo High School, now Martin High School. He played on the former Laredo polo team and was a consummate horseman, who <b>never</b> <b>complained,</b> even when being thrown from a horse. Killam procured a bachelor's degree from the University of Texas at Austin and a law degree from Harvard Law School.|$|E

500|$|During his career, Ford {{developed}} a reputation as an immensely physical centre-forward, especially toward opposition goalkeepers. His Wales international teammate John Charles commented on his playing style, stating that [...] "He used to bang everybody and knock {{them out of the}} way, he was never frightened" [...] but also described him as a wonderful person. Former England international Gil Merrick accused Ford of maltreating goalkeepers in his autobiography, although Ford later sued Merrick, stating that he had never been cautioned or sent off over his style of play, and received an apology and the withdrawal of the book over the claim. Ford himself stated that his personality was transformed once he stepped onto a football pitch, describing himself as [...] "Like an animal" [...] but also commenting that he was simply [...] "doing his job and doing it well" [...] Billy Bingham later stated [...] "He got some terrible knocks from goalkeepers but he also knew how to dish it out and he <b>never</b> <b>complained</b> to refs".|$|E
500|$|Speculation {{surfaced}} that Coolio {{had actually}} given permission but later changed his mind, or that Yankovic's record label {{had lied to}} Yankovic {{in the hopes that}} the song would become popular. Yankovic later stated on VH1's Behind the Music that he had written a sincere letter of apology to Coolio which was never returned, and that Coolio <b>never</b> <b>complained</b> when he received his royalty check from proceeds of the song. A series of photos taken at the XM Satellite Radio booth at the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show, and a post on the [...] "Ask Al" [...] feature on Yankovic's website suggested that Yankovic and Coolio made amends. According to Yankovic, he was very surprised when Coolio came over to chat. He later joked on his site's Q feature that, [...] "I doubt I'll be invited to Coolio's next birthday party but at least I can stop wearing that bulletproof vest to the mall." ...|$|E

500|$|A nightclub {{manager in}} Glendale, C. J. Graham, was interviewed {{for the role}} of Jason in Jason Lives, but was {{initially}} passed over because he had no experience as a stuntman. Dan Bradley was hired, but Paramount executives felt Bradley did not have the right physique to play the role, and Graham was hired to replace him. Although Bradley was replaced early during filming, he {{can be seen in the}} paintball sequence of the film. Graham opted to perform most of his own stunts, including the scene where Jason catches on fire while battling Tommy in the lake. The rest of the cast spoke highly of Graham, remarking that he <b>never</b> <b>complained</b> during all the uncomfortable situations he was placed in. Graham had no intention of being an actor or a stuntman, but the idea of playing the [...] "bad guy", and the opportunity to wear the prosthetics, intrigued him. Graham was not brought back to reprise the role, but has often been cited as speaking highly of his time in the part.|$|E
500|$|Within a year Cardus {{had been}} moved from the reporters' room {{to take charge of}} the paper's [...] "Miscellany" [...] column. He also resumed the duties of {{part-time}} secretary to Scott, who was at this time over 70, and had edited The Manchester Guardian since 1872. Despite his years, he struck Cardus as [...] "of inexhaustible energy and aliveness". Scott was a demanding employer, who gave his young writers free rein, but expected in return long hours and total dedication. Driven hard, sometimes to the point of exhaustion, Cardus nevertheless relished these years, and <b>never</b> <b>complained</b> to Scott of weariness. Early in 1919 his role changed again, when he was made junior drama critic under the direction of C.E. Montague, the paper's principal theatre critic who had returned from war service with no great desire to continue in the role. Cardus's principal ambitions still lay in the direction of music criticism, though he recognised that this door was closed while Samuel Langford, music critic since 1906, remained in post. In preparation for any opportunity that might arise in that direction, Cardus maintained a daily two-hour study of music or music literature.|$|E
500|$|On 6 January 2016, {{recording}} Barcelona's {{first goal}} of the new year, Messi scored two goals and assisted the other two in a 4–1 derby win over Espanyol at the Camp Nou, in {{the first leg of}} the round of 16 of the 2015–16 Copa del Rey. Five days later, Messi won the FIFA Ballon d'Or for a record fifth time in his career. On 3 February, he scored a hat-trick in Barcelona's 7–0 win against Valenciain the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final at the Camp Nou, also scoring his 500th career goal in the process, including youth competitions. With teammate Luis Suárez scoring the other four goals in the same match, {{this was the first time}} that two players had scored at least three goals each at Camp Nou, and the first time since Luis Suárez Miramontes and Justo Tejada in 1956. The feat had only occurred three times before in the club's history, all at Camp de Les Corts. The next league match at Camp Nou, a 6–1 win against Celta de Vigo, Messi assisted Suárez from a penalty kick. Some people saw it as [...] "a touch of genius", while others criticised it as being disrespectful to the opponent. The Celta players, however, <b>never</b> <b>complained</b> and their coach defended the penalty, stating, [...] "Barca's forwards are very respectful." [...] The penalty routine has been compared to that of Barça icon Johan Cruyff in 1982, who was battling lung cancer, leading many fans to indicate that the penalty was a tribute to him. Cruyff himself was [...] "very happy" [...] with the play, insisting [...] "it was legal and entertaining".|$|E

5000|$|Shadow World {{received}} little press {{in spite of}} Potter's well-known reputation in the Atari market.

2500|$|Journalist David Foot, the {{historian}} of Somerset cricket, wrote of Hunt {{that he had}} [...] "a healthy cynicism {{about the life of}} an expendable professional cricketer" [...] and that he [...] "preferred to stick to his weekend matches for his village team, Lodway". Foot added: [...] "His pals in the parish used to say of him: 'He had the most perfect temperament we ever came across – the bowler who <b>never</b> <b>complained.</b> We could put down five catches off him, as we did more than once, and he merely smiled'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Liston <b>never</b> <b>complained</b> about prison, {{saying he}} was {{guaranteed}} three meals every day. The athletic director at Missouri State Penitentiary, Rev. Alois Stevens, suggested to Liston that he try boxing, and his obvious aptitude, along with an endorsement from Stevens, {{who was also a}} priest, aided Liston in getting an early parole. Stevens organized a sparring session with a professional heavyweight named Thurman Wilson to showcase Liston's potential. After two rounds, Wilson had taken enough. [...] "Better get me out of this ring, he is going to kill me!" [...] he exclaimed.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a tribute}} to McManaman, four years {{after he left the}} club, ex-coach Vicente del Bosque told Spanish {{newspaper}} AS Marca, that McManaman and Geremi were the two most important players in his squad, because [...] "together they kept the whole team united". Del Bosque added, [...] "I was very happy with Macca. He was a caballero, a gentleman, a stupendous guy; he always had a smile, he <b>never</b> <b>complained,</b> he was great, a leader. He related to everyone very well; he united people. He had a bad time [...] with achilles pain, but every day he trained with the same attitude. He was exemplary ... and a good footballer too, very good. A fantastic player in every sense." ...|$|E
