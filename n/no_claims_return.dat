However, especially in Japan, the art works are only purchased by the people who are interested in art, art market is smaller than other country. Therefore, the artists 1 who can live by their own income which are earned by selling art works are extremely small population. For our project, the target is developing artists rather than well-known artists. The objective is supporting those artist to be able to live with their art works incomes, and activation of the art market. The ideal is as the theme of the ALPS, "Symbiosis and Synergy", the society which is more sophisticated and possible for artist to live by their own art works, by symbiosis of people and artists, through effecting each other and filling those life style. Our plan is constructing the imagination space. We offer the place where could be possible for collectors, artist, and dealers to communicate by Avatar system. It is expected to increase the numbers of user contacts by omit the searching process. The features are, there is more Avatar on the screen more than general SNS, and it is possible to do mutual assessing, of possessing art works, and chat by Avatar which add an arrow above their heads and colors which define the types. 2 And also it could be able to gathering the people who have same interesting, by built the building which are made a distinction by genres, "PICTURE", "SCLUPTURE", "MODERN ART". Of course it is possible to make a deal of art works within this service. In general artist are depended their art works display to dealer who has own gallery, then make a business, selling, dealing. In this case, the 40 % of sales are for dealers, rest of 40 % are for artist, rest of 20 % are for management, and this is our profit. And also, this is the feature that it's possible to return the art works when it was different from what they imagined. On the other dealing is that artist and collectors are making a deal directly. In this case, the fee of management is changed by their sales, and <b>No</b> <b>claim,</b> <b>No</b> <b>returns</b> is principle. The difference between this and other services are this service is focusing on the art, and the all inside of the service information is concluded in art. It is different from searching the art from unintentional information. And, it is possible to stimulate the art market through the acquisition of the potential customer, supporting of young artist by advertising of the Real World art event, connecting to the evaluation of works between the new friends...|$|R
