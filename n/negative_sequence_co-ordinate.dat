40|$|Abstract — StatCom {{is a type}} of {{device that}} can be used for {{controlling}} as well as reducing positive and <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> voltages produced in a system. It is a static synchronous generator which controls capacitive or inductive output current irrespective of the ac system voltage. The main source of arising of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> voltages are generation of unsymmetrical faults in a wind farm. Positive sequence voltage causes voltage instability and <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage causes heavy generator torque oscillations which leads to mechanical vibration. Unbalanced voltage causes unbalanced heating in the machine winding.

40|$|In {{practical}} power systems, it {{is normally}} impossible to maintain perfect balance or symmetry in phase voltages and currents. The {{diversity of the}} load, such as single phase, arc furnaces and railway, enhances the amount of unbalance or <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> components. Alongside asymmetrical load, further increase in <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> components is introduced due to the network inherent asymmetry i. e. untransposed transmission. Thus, they are usually excessive and exceeds standards at weak nodes in the network. Utilities and customers have to comply certain code agreements to limit the degree of <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> components in the network. This is because that <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> components cause deterioration to the network equipments. For instance, higher loss, torque oscillation, speed reduction and excessive rotor heat are undesirable obstacles to rotating machines. Asymmetrical load compensator can be based on passive elements, i. e. inductors and capacitors such as a Static Var Compensator (SVC), or a Voltage Source Converter (VSC) such as a Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM). The utilization of the <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> controller, an SVC or a STATCOM provides, gains a significant interest to most utilities around the globe. The compensators basically inject a different capacitive or inductive <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> current that has an opposite phase of the load <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> current. As a result, the network see symmetrical load and phase voltages and currents are balanced without exchanging active power between the network and the compensator. The thesis investigates {{the benefits of the}} SVC <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> controller to a network with a detailed description about the SVC characteristics and control components. The thesis also presents unbalance assessment methods implemented in practical networks during the planning stage. Moreover, drawbacks of <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> components to network apparatus i. e. rotating machines and transmission lines are summarized. The analysis is carried out using PSCAD for a simple network representation and IEEE 14 bus system. The result illustrates that the SVC allows utilities to balance asymmetrical loads to mitigate <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> components. The SVC response to balance asymmetrical load depends on load type, network strength and sources of unbalance. The SVC exhibits a very fast response to reduce the <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> components in extreme cases of unbalance such as asymmetrical short circuit. The SVC in general can mitigate <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> components caused by a sources connected in the same bus which means that the SVC provides local balancing only. Besides the <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> controller, the SVC enable a power factor correction by compensating for the reactive components of the load positive sequence current...|$|R

This paper describes three different dynamic voltage control options during unbalanced grid faults: 1) the positive sequence voltage control with only a positive sequence reactive current injection and suppression of the <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> current; 2) the positive sequence voltage control with limitation of the positive sequence reactive current injection and suppression of the <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> current; and 3) the positive and <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage control with both a positive and a <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> reactive current injection. These different control options are compared in simulations of a wind power plant connected to a meshed power system, including synchronous generators. It is shown that both the positive sequence voltage control with limitation and the positive and <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage control can overcome the voltage rise and voltage distortion that can occur with pure positive sequence voltage control without limitation.

30|$|Some of {{the common}} {{transient}} events that occur in a power system are voltage drop because of overloading and generator outage. The condition checks involving <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> components and their threshold values help {{to distinguish between the}} faulted condition and transient events. Only the <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> components exist when there is an unbalance amongst the three phases of the system. When there is a generator outage, though the overall voltage of the system might drop, the effect is uniform in all the three phases. Hence, during this transient event, <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> component of bus voltages will not exist. So, generator outage will not be identified as a fault in the transmission system. Similarly, voltage drops caused by overloading is uniform in all the three phases. Even if it is not uniform in all the three phases, the unbalance in the system is much less compared to a fault event. Hence, the <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage component will be very less or none in this case. During an unbalanced fault event, the fault current in the faulted phase of the line is enormous (ranging from 2 p.u to more than 40 p.u) which is caused by corresponding unbalance in the voltage level as well. Hence, the <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> components arising from a faulted event is large and very significant compared to unbalanced loaded conditions. Hence, the threshold setting (which would be obtained based on experimental studies of the system) based on the <b>negative</b> <b>sequence</b> components helps distinguish transient events from faulted events.|$|R
