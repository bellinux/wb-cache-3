5|$|Pam asks Jim {{to talk to}} {{her father}} and {{convince}} him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he realized that he had <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.|$|E
25|$|The Brown {{decision}} {{was a powerful}} moral statement clad in a weak constitutional analysis; Warren was never a legal scholar {{on a par with}} Frankfurter or a great advocate of particular doctrines, as was Black. Instead, he believed that in all branches of government common sense, decency, and elemental justice were decisive, not precedent (stare decisis), tradition or the text of the Constitution. He wanted results. He <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> doctrine alone should be allowed to deprive people of justice. He felt racial segregation was simply wrong, and Brown, whatever its doctrinal defects, remains a landmark decision primarily because of Warren's interpretation of the equal protection clause to mean that children should not be shunted to a separate world reserved for minorities.|$|E
25|$|In 1766 Johann Lambert wrote, {{but did not}} publish, Theorie der Parallellinien {{in which}} he attempted, as Saccheri did, to prove the fifth postulate. He worked with a figure that today we call a Lambert {{quadrilateral}}, a quadrilateral with three right angles (can be considered half of a Saccheri quadrilateral). He quickly eliminated {{the possibility that the}} fourth angle is obtuse, as had Saccheri and Khayyam, and then proceeded to prove many theorems under the assumption of an acute angle. Unlike Saccheri, he <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> he had reached a contradiction with this assumption. He had proved the non-Euclidean result that the sum of the angles in a triangle increases as the area of the triangle decreases, and this led him to speculate on the possibility of a model of the acute case on a sphere of imaginary radius. He did not carry this idea any further.|$|E

500|$|André Kertész ( [...] ; 2 July 1894 – 28 September 1985), born Kertész Andor, was a Hungarian-born {{photographer}} {{known for}} his groundbreaking contributions to photographic composition and the photo essay. In {{the early years of}} his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he {{is considered one of the}} seminal figures of photojournalism.|$|E
500|$|Leslie Uggams {{said that}} she was in the film in July 2015, portraying Blind Al. Tim Miller stated that Jed Rees portrays [...] "The Recruiter", and [...] "did a good job of being creepy and syrupy sweet." [...] Miller {{explained}} that Colossus would be a solely CGI creation in the film because, as a fan of the character, he had <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Cudmore's version was accurate to the comics and wanted to show the character as [...] "this monstrous guy". Andre Tricoteux had been cast in the role, providing motion reference on set and the voice. In December, the voice of Colossus was revealed to have been recast, with Stefan Kapičić taking over the role. He completed his work eight weeks before the film was scheduled for release.|$|E
500|$|Ratajkowski visited nude {{beaches in}} Europe {{with her family}} during her youth. Exposure to the nude female figure in {{photography}} and art during her formative years, including the work of her father, {{as well as the}} photography of Helmut Newton and Herb Ritts, prepared Ratajkowski for nude work. She is comfortable with the naked body, and states, [...] "We have this culture of men, especially, watching pornography, but then [...] offended by a classic nude portrait or photograph, and I've <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> way." [...] Ratajkowski was also influenced by third-wave feminism and works such as The Beauty Myth and Promiscuities by Naomi Wolf. She claims that her role selection is swayed by the Bechdel test. She was a physically mature young teenager who endured pressure to limit expressing her sexuality and how she presented herself.|$|E
5000|$|... 28The dawning morn {{with songs}} thou dost prevent,Sets hundred notes unto thy {{feathered}} crew,So each one tunes his pretty instrument,And warbling out the old, begin anew,And thus they pass their youth in summer season,Then follow thee into a better Region,Where winter’s <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> by <b>that</b> sweet airy legion.|$|R

5000|$|In May 2017, Rag'n'Bone Man {{endorsed}} Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 UK general election. During {{an interview}} with Channel 4, he said he saw Corbyn as a [...] "man that speaks with passion". He added that he could [...] "relate to what he says and have <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> like <b>that</b> before".|$|R
500|$|The {{album was}} largely {{neglected}} by the record label, which {{did little to}} no promotion in the US. Pearlman stated that [...] "there was actually no intention {{on the part of}} Columbia Records at all to promote it. (...) Basically the people wanted to work it and they were told not to work it". Roeser commented later that he did not [...] "think Sony’s ever really known how to sell us, from the beginning (...) and Columbia <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> they knew how to market us". Imaginos fared better with CBS International, which distributed the album abroad and produced a music video for [...] "Astronomy" [...] in the UK, which aired in coincidence with the European tour dates of 1989. The video clip does not feature members of the band, but begins with the spoken introduction by Stephen King and focuses on the storyline narrated in the album.|$|E
500|$|After {{the end of}} {{the four}} day engagement, Deke's {{management}} is offered a one-man show in Freegate, Texas, outside of Dallas. Due to the terms of the contract, Tex fires Susan and the singing trio, leaving only Deke in the show. Before he has to begin his new tour, Deke drives Susan to her family's farm. Meanwhile, in another publicity move, Glenda convinces Tex to buy a Imperial against his life insurance for Deke, inventing a story to tell Deke that it was a gift from the widow of an oil magnate. Back on the farm, Deke and Susan talk, where she tells him about being fired, after which they are about to kiss, when they are interrupted by her parents, who ask him to sing the song he promised. After Deke sings [...] "Loving You", a surprised Susan remarks that she never heard him sing that way; Deke admits that he <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> way before.|$|E
500|$|Nesbitt {{returned}} to theatre acting in June 2005 {{when he appeared}} in David Nicholls' After Sun, a ten-minute-play performed {{as part of the}} Old Vic's 24-Hour Play season. Nesbitt and Catherine Tate starred as a married couple who meet a pair of newlyweds returning from their honeymoon. Later that year, he appeared in his first full-length play in 11 years, in Owen McCafferty's Shoot the Crow. He enjoyed the stimulation of learning his lines and rehearsing with the cast and director. The play opened at the Trafalgar Studios in September 2005 and his role as Socrates gained mixed reviews. In The Independent, Michael Coveney suggested the role did not fit the actor: [...] "Nesbitt is cool. But I <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> he was inside his role of a chap called Socrates [...] He grinned and shrugged through the evening which steadily became less about grouting on tiles and more about grating on nerves." [...] In The Daily Telegraph, Charles Spencer described Nesbitt's acting as [...] "outstanding".|$|E
5000|$|Dobbyn {{has noted}} the {{adoption}} of [...] "Loyal" [...] into the wider New Zealand psyche: [...] It's now got {{a life of its}} own. I never knew what that meant - New Zealand musician Neil Finnis always on about songs becoming everybody else's - and I <b>never</b> really <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> until that song. Dave Dobbyn ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I never did,--and I never will,--express {{an opinion}} {{of my own}} as to the guilt or innocence of a client till after the trial is over. But I have {{sometimes}} felt as though I would give the blood out of my veins to save a man. I <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> in <b>that</b> way more strongly than I do now." ...|$|R
500|$|Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club {{suggested}} that the influence of Endtroducing..... {{may have had a}} negative effect on the album itself, saying that it [...] "has been partially diluted by the symphonic beat-collage culture it helped spawn." [...] The album's acclaim set considerably high standards for future releases by DJ Shadow, and he has expressed his dissatisfaction with being expected to [...] "repeat Endtroducing..... over and over again". Despite this, DJ Shadow {{has made it clear that}} he views the album in a positive light and denies any pressure that may have come about as a result of the album's praise: [...] "...people always seem to suggest that there's this pressure, and that Endtroducing..... is some kind of albatross, and I've just honestly <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> way. I think that I have a healthy enough respect for the lineage of the music and how rare it is that you can connect with an audience. If that will always be 'the record' then so be it, that's cool." [...] As of April 26, 2005, Endtroducing..... has sold upwards of 290,000 copies in the United States alone.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{called his}} U.S.-based {{advisers}} to his Texas ranch for discussions on Christmas Day. Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara advised Johnson to reject Taylor's proposal. Johnson declined to act, stating that an escalation during the Christmas period would be inappropriate, {{as it would}} damage public morale. He also noted {{that because of the}} political instability in Saigon, the international community and the American public were unlikely to believe that the Vietcong were behind the attack, feeling that they would instead blame local infighting for the bombing. This was {{despite the fact that the}} Vietcong had already claimed responsibility. Johnson administration officials concluded four days after the bombing that the Vietcong were responsible. Johnson believed that it was too late to retaliate and that any action taken more than 36 hours after the event constituted unprovoked aggression. The State Department cabled Taylor and the embassy, saying that [...] "In view of the overall confusion in Saigon", public U.S. and international opinion towards an American air strike would be that the Johnson administration was [...] "trying to shoot its way out of an internal [...] political crisis". Johnson said to Taylor that [...] "Every time I get a military recommendation it seems to me that it calls for large-scale bombing. I have <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> this war will be won from the air." [...] At the time, Johnson was reluctant to accede to his officials' calls for large-scale bombing of North Vietnam, a strategy that eventually became policy.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} high school, {{he had become}} {{interested}} first in evangelical Christianity, then Nazism, and later held memberships in both the National Socialist White People's Party and the Ku Klux Klan and even {{changed his name to}} Joseph Paul Franklin in honor of Paul Joseph Goebbels and Benjamin Franklin. In the 1960s, Franklin was inspired to try to start a race war after reading Mein Kampf. [...] "I've <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> way about any other book that I read," [...] he would reflect later. [...] "It was something weird about that book." ...|$|E
5000|$|A dim-witted {{individual}} [...] "two biscuits {{short of}} a box" [...] is how they describe him in The Queen Victoria public house. His life has been hard.

5000|$|She said, [...] "I {{thought it}} would be like a summer holiday job ...then one film led to another and {{suddenly}} I was an actor and I <b>never</b> really <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> I had made the decision ...

5000|$|According to {{a letter}} she wrote from prison, Denyer began {{identifying}} as a woman in 2003. She has claimed that her feelings of gender dysphoria are what led her to seek revenge against women by murdering them. In another letter, she wrote: [...] "I committed these disgusting crimes ... not because I ever hated womankind, but because I have <b>never</b> really <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> I was male." ...|$|R
2500|$|Her use of basic, {{everyday}} {{language is}} a point of contention. At first it can come across as simple, but that simplicity of language allows for a greater range of emotion to come out in her work. She explains this in her introduction to Bone Dance: “I <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it was enough to display agility with words or clever turns of phrase. I believe that inaccessible poetry does not work. If the listener must take a special class in how to appreciate it, then the poem has failed. I hold myself to that standard and try to remember that 'ordinary' language contains all of the imagery and beauty needed by the poem.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Sakharov <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> by {{creating}} nuclear weapons he had [...] "known sin", in Oppenheimer's expression. He later wrote: [...] "After {{more than forty}} years, we have had no third world war, and the balance of nuclear terror... may have helped to prevent one. But I am {{not at all sure}} of this; back then, in those long-gone years, the question didn't even arise. What most troubles me now is the instability of the balance, the extreme peril of the current situation, the appalling waste of the arms race... Each of us has a responsibility to think about this in global terms, with tolerance, trust, and candor, free from ideological dogmatism, parochial interests, or national egotism." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2014, during PAX Australia, Bethesda officially {{cancelled}} Prey 2. Hines stated, [...] "It {{was a game}} {{we believed}} in, but we <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it got to where {{it needed to be}} –– we never saw a path to success if we finished it. It wasn't up to our quality standard, and we decided to cancel it. It’s no longer in development. That wasn't an easy decision, but it’s one that won’t surprise many folks given that we hadn't been talking about it. Human Head Studios is no longer working on it. It's a franchise we still believe we can do something with — we just need to see what that something is." [...] Tim Gerritsen, business development director at Human Head Studios, said, [...] "While we are disappointed that we won’t be able to deliver our vision of the game, we remain proud of our work on the franchise, which we feel speaks for itself, including the award-winning presentation of the game at E3 2011. We enjoyed working with the many talented people at Bethesda, and we wish them all the best of luck with any future plans they may have for the franchise." ...|$|E
500|$|A large {{aspect of}} the game is the {{alternative}} history in which it is set, where the Nazis won the Second World War. The team saw this aspect as an opportunity to create everything at a very large scale, with very little limitations; [...] "so many things that we can create, and work with, and expand on. So, I <b>never</b> really <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> we were limited," [...] said Öjerfors.|$|R

I <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> thankful <b>that</b> a pig could not climb before,” he laughed, as he cut a melon hanging overhead. Although {{somewhat}} wanting in flavour the fruit seemed to the three men, after their privation for upwards of a month from green vegetables or fruit, to be delicious. “How do you suppose that it got here, captain?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> way," [...] persisted the Colonel. [...] "I've lent him the money, and I've {{kept his}} stocks. And he {{got what he}} wanted out of me." ...|$|E

6000|$|The acting was perfect. The house {{burst into}} unusual shouts of admiration. Madame Carolina applauded {{with her little}} finger on her fan. The Grand Duke himself gave the signal for applause. Vivian <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> before <b>that</b> words were useless. His hand was {{suddenly}} pressed. He turned round; it was the Baroness.

6000|$|... "There came {{a letter}} to me when I was in prison {{from one of the}} leading men in Tankerville, saying that I ought to resign. I know they all thought that I was guilty.
