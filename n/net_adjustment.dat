40|$|Most {{models of}} dynamic labor demand {{are written in}} terms of costs of {{adjusting}} employment (<b>net</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs). A few {{are based on the}} costs of hiring and firing (gross adjustment costs). This study derives several models containing both types of adjustment costs. A dynamic-programming model with quadratic adjustment costs generates an estimate of the lower bound on the fraction of adjustment costs that are gross costs. A model with lumpy costs of adjustment also estimates the relative sizes of the two types of costs. The models are estimated over two sets of short monthly time series obtained from private sources, one from a medium-size hospital, the other describing three plants operated by a small manufacturing firm, The quadratic-cost model is also estimated using data describing small industries. The estimates demonstrate that the importance of the two types of costs differs across establishments, though gross adjustment costs appear relatively larger.

30|$|Large {{residuals}} remain {{between the}} observations and calculations, in northwestward displacements between observations and calculations {{on the west}} side of the triangulation net (Fig. 2 (a)). This could be caused by the time difference between the surveys, i.e., before and after the earthquake. In this region, the Philippine Sea plate is subducting towards the north-northwest at a rate of 2 – 4 cm/year and, due to this, a horizontal displacement exceeding 1 cm/year occurs in this region (e.g., Miyazaki and Heki, 2001). A relative horizontal displacement could therefore occur in a direction northwest to southeast. As a result, the ordinary horizontal dilatation rate in this region is approximately — 0.1 ppm/year (Kobayashi and Hashimoto, 2007). Because the displacements shown in Fig. 2 (a) were detected from measurements spanning 4 – 23 years, and the points were not less than tens of kilometers away from fixed points, it appears that the relative motions of the fixed points could therefore reach tens of centimeters. Another explanation for this could be the way in which the fixed points are chosen at the <b>net</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the triangulation survey. Since the area where the re-survey was carried out was not vast, we chose only the fixed point in this way.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{dynamics}} of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the equatorial Pacific Ocean are largely {{associated with the}} slow thermocline adjustment at interannual and basin scales. This adjustment involves, among other things, the fast propagation and reflection of equatorial waves by wind stress forcing. A simple and straightforward asymptotic expansion of the long-wave equations is proposed using the low-frequency approximation. The asymptotic expansion is performed in Fourier space, retaining only the gravest equatorial long waves and baroclinic modes with the largest scale, and considering small dissipation by friction and boundary reflections. This leads to an asymptotic model for the thermocline response to wind stress forcing, which is in essence the ocean component of the recharge-discharge model of ENSO. The asymptotic model is nonheuristic and in broad agreement with some essential results scattered in previous studies. Thermocline variability is divided into a sloping "Tilt mode" that adjusts instantly to wind stress forcing and a zonal-mean "Warm Water Volume mode" that adjusts as a time integrator to wind stress curl.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the welfare effects of trade in a Heckscher-Ohlin model of trade with costs of adjustment. The paper analyses {{the efficiency and}} the distributional effects of eliminating a tariff in a formerly protected sector. The tariff can be eliminated at the onset or after a while. In case of postponing {{the elimination of the}} tariff, the government may pre-announce the policy change or may not do it and surprise the private sector. It is shown that while large adjustment costs reduce the efficiency gains from trade liberalisation, small to moderate adjustment costs may raise the efficiency gains from a pre-announced liberalisation. The (<b>net)</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs reduce the welfare gains and losses of owners of production factors from a sudden unanticipated liberalisation. The policy risk is partially shifted towards owners of firms. The distributional effects of trade liberalisations are more complex when the policy is pre-announced. The adjustment costs may increase the gains and losses of owners of the production factors, for small and moderate levels. Also, the announcement that the tariff will be eliminated affects the value of the firms, and when the adjustment cost are not high it may raise rather than reduce the value of the firms in the formerly protected sector. ...|$|E
