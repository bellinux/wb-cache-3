The trend towards biological analysis at increasingly smaller scales, ultimately {{down to the}} volume of an individual cell, continues, and mass spectrometry with a sensitivity of a few to single molecules will be necessary. Nanoelectromechanical systems provide unparalleled mass sensitivity, which is now sufficient {{for the detection of}} individual molecular species in real time. Here, we report the first demonstration of mass spectrometry based on single biological molecule detection with a <b>nanoelectromechanical</b> <b>system.</b> In our nanoelectromechanical–mass spectrometry system, nanoparticles and protein species are introduced by electrospray injection from the fluid phase in ambient conditions into vacuum, and are subsequently delivered to the <b>nanoelectromechanical</b> <b>system</b> detector by hexapole ion optics. Precipitous frequency shifts, proportional to the mass, are recorded in real time as analytes adsorb, one by one, onto a phase-locked, ultrahigh-frequency nanoelectromechanical resonator. These first nanoelectromechanical system–mass spectrometry spectra, obtained with modest mass sensitivity from only several hundred mass adsorption events, presage the future capabilities of this approach. We also outline the substantial improvements that are feasible in the near term, some of which are unique to <b>nanoelectromechanical</b> <b>system</b> based-mass spectrometry...|$|E

The statistical breaking position distributions of the nanowires have been investigated to give the effects of strain rate and crystallographic orientation on micro-atomic fluctuation in the symmetric stretching of the nanowires. When the strain rate is less than 0.26 % ps- 1, macro-breaking position distributions exhibit the anisotropy of micro-atomic fluctuation. However, when the strain rate is larger than 3.54 % ps- 1, the anisotropy is not obvious because of strong symmetric shocks.|$|E
