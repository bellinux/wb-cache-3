50|$|The <b>natural</b> <b>join</b> {{is arguably}} {{one of the}} most {{important}} operators since it is the relational counterpart of logical AND. Note carefully that if the same variable appears in each of two predicates that are connected by AND, then that variable stands for the same thing and both appearances must always be substituted by the same value. In particular, <b>natural</b> <b>join</b> allows the combination of relations that are associated by a foreign key. For example, in the above example a foreign key probably holds from Employee.DeptName to Dept.DeptName and then the <b>natural</b> <b>join</b> of Employee and Dept combines all employees with their departments. Note that this works because the foreign key holds between attributes with the same name. If this is not the case such as in the foreign key from Dept.manager to Employee.Name then we have to rename these columns before we take the <b>natural</b> <b>join.</b> Such a join is sometimes also referred to as an equijoin (see θ-join).|$|E

The approach we follow is elementary [...] -we try to introduce as few notions as possible. We claim that bicategorical algebra handles gracefully multirelations and their operations, and that multirelations are essential {{in a number of}} applications; moreover, the bicategorical composition of multirelations turns out to correspond to <b>natural</b> <b>joins.</b> From the formal semantics we derive an algorithm that can establish statically the possibility of building parallel ownership paths of weak entities.

5000|$|The join {{operation}} defined for relational databases {{is often}} referred to as a <b>natural</b> <b>join.</b> In this type of join, two relations are connected by their common attributes. MySQL's approximation of a <b>natural</b> <b>join</b> is the INNER JOIN operator. In SQL, an INNER JOIN prevents a cartesian product from occurring when there are two tables in a query. For each table added to a SQL Query, one additional INNER JOIN is added to prevent a cartesian product. Thus, for N tables in an SQL query, there must be N-1 INNER JOINS to prevent a cartesian product.|$|E

40|$|April 1996 Abstract. We {{introduce}} a new point of view into database schemes by applying systematically an old logical technique: translation schemes, and their induced formula transformation. This allows us to reexamine the notion of dependency preserving decomposition and its generalization refinement. This logical tool allows {{us to have a}} new look a BCNF and show that every scheme specified by functional dependencies (FD's) has a dependency preserving refinement into BCNF. Furthermore we give a characterization of the embedded implicational dependencies (EID's) using FD's and inclusion dependencies (ID's) and a basic class of refinements consisting of projections and <b>natural</b> <b>joins.</b> Finally, we discuss how this technique allows us to define refinements of entity-relationship schemes. 1 Introduction Traditional design theory of relational databases comprises the following steps: [...] Identify a set of entities; [...] Identify, for each entity, a fixed set of attributes; [...] Identify a [...] ...|$|R
