25|$|In {{addition}} to gabbro, the second intrusive suite included <b>nepheline</b> syenite, diorite and monzonite. The third intrusive occupies {{the eastern side}} and is mainly peralkaline <b>nepheline</b> syenites and porphyrites. The most mineralogically interesting are the associated agpaitic (alkali rich, low aluminium and silicon) pegmatites, the intrusive breccias, and the hornfels derived from the metasomatised sedimentary wall rocks. There have been over 366 distinct species of minerals collected at Mont Saint-Hilaire, 50 of which have this site as type locality.|$|E

25|$|Feldspathoids are {{structurally}} {{similar to}} feldspar, but differ {{in that they}} form in Si-deficient conditions which allows for further substitution by Al3+. As a result, feldsapthoids cannot be associated with quartz. A common example of a feldsapthoid is <b>nepheline</b> ((Na, K)AlSiO4); compared to alkali feldspar, <b>nepheline</b> has an Al2O3:SiO2 ratio of 1:2, as opposed to 1:6 in the feldspar. Zeolites often have distinctive crystal habits, occurring in needles, plates, or blocky masses. They form {{in the presence of}} water at low temperatures and pressures, and have channels and voids in their structure. Zeolites have several industrial applications, especially in waste water treatment.|$|E

25|$|Soft-paste porcelains {{date back}} from the early {{attempts}} by European potters to replicate Chinese porcelain by using mixtures of clay and frit. Soapstone and lime were {{known to have been}} included in these compositions. These wares were not yet actual porcelain wares as they were not hard nor vitrified by firing kaolin clay at high temperatures. As these early formulations suffered from high pyroplastic deformation, or slumping in the kiln at high temperatures, they were uneconomic to produce and of low quality. Formulations were later developed based on kaolin with quartz, feldspars, <b>nepheline</b> syenite or other feldspathic rocks. These were technically superior, and continue to be produced. Soft-paste porcelains are fired at lower temperatures than hard-paste porcelain, therefore these wares are generally less hard than hard-paste porcelains.|$|E
2500|$|A unique {{feature in}} the {{watershed}} is Rutan Hill, also called Volcanic Hill, {{thought to be the}} throat of an ancient, extinct volcano which was active {{at the end of the}} Taconic Orogeny approximately 420 million years ago. This nondescript hill in the Beemerville section of Wantage Township, is the surface expression of a [...] lamprophyric diatreme that is the northern part of the Late Ordovician Beemerville Alkaline Complex that also includes two large <b>nepheline</b> syenite plutons; and several other nearby and much smaller dikes, sills, and diatremes.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the journal}} Science from September 2013, {{researchers}} described {{a different type}} of rock called [...] "Jake M" [...] or [...] "Jake Matijevic (rock),” It was the first rock analyzed by the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer instrument on the Curiosity rover, and it was different from other known martian igneous rocks as it is alkaline (>15% normative <b>nepheline)</b> and relatively fractionated. Jake M is similar to terrestrial mugearites, a rock type typically found at ocean islands and continental rifts. Jake M discovery may mean that alkaline magmas may be more common on Mars than on Earth and that Curiosity could encounter even more fractionated alkaline rocks (for example, phonolites and trachytes).|$|E
50|$|On {{the rock}} {{surface in the}} case {{hardening}} of alkaline felsic rocks, the weathering selectively affects certain minerals. <b>Nepheline</b> is very sensitive to weathering and is altered to natrolita and cancrinite. On the outcroping surface of a <b>nepheline</b> syenite, phonolite or <b>nepheline</b> syenite gneiss, the minerals formed by <b>nepheline</b> alteration appear white in colour on the dark-coloured weatherd background. After the <b>nepheline</b> alteration products are leached, small holes are formed on the rock.|$|E
5000|$|Essexites are {{no longer}} {{considered}} part of the theralite group and are more properly known as <b>nepheline</b> monzogabbro or <b>nepheline</b> monzodiorite. The presence of orthoclase indicates a petrogenetic difference with <b>nepheline</b> gabbros.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nepheline</b> syenites are silica-undersaturated {{and some}} are {{peralkaline}} (terms discussed in igneous rock). <b>Nepheline</b> is a feldspathoid, a solid-solution mineral, that does not coexist with quartz; rather, <b>nepheline</b> would react with quartz to produce alkali feldspar.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{petrology}} identifies rocks {{according to}} mineralogical criteria. Utilising the IUGS QAPF diagram of Streckeisen (1974) [...] "essexite" [...] is more formally known as <b>nepheline</b> monzodiorite or <b>nepheline</b> monzogabbro {{depending on the}} ratio of orthoclase to plagioclase and the abundance of <b>nepheline.</b>|$|E

50|$|Benmoreite is a silica-undersaturated {{volcanic}} rock of intermediate composition. It is a sodium-rich variety of trachyandesite and {{belongs to the}} alkalic suite of igneous rocks. An origin by fractionation from basanite through <b>nepheline</b> hawaiite to <b>nepheline</b> benmoreite has been demonstrated for a volcanic suite in the McMurdo Volcanic Group of late Cenozoic age in McMurdo Sound area. <b>Nepheline</b> benmoreite magmas derived from mantle sources containing lherzolite xenoliths display similarities to some plutonic <b>nepheline</b> syenites.|$|E

50|$|Because <b>nepheline</b> syenite lacks quartz and {{is rich in}} {{feldspar}} and <b>nepheline,</b> it is used in {{the manufacturing}} of glass and ceramics.|$|E
50|$|It {{occurs in}} <b>nepheline</b> syenites and pegmatites in {{association}} with aegirine, <b>nepheline,</b> microcline, arfvedsonite, elpidite, loparite, eudialyte, astrophyllite, mangan-neptunite, lavenite, rinkite, apatite, titanite and ilmenite.|$|E
50|$|Boehmite {{occurs in}} {{tropical}} laterites and bauxites developed on alumino-silicate bedrock.

Industrially, {{it is used}} as an inexpensive flame retardant additive for fire-safe polymers.|$|E
50|$|Litchfieldite {{is a rare}} igneous rock. It is a coarse-grained, foliated {{variety of}} <b>nepheline</b> syenite, {{sometimes}} called <b>nepheline</b> syenite gneiss or gneissic nepeheline syenite. Litchfieldite is composed of two varieties of feldspar (mostly albite but also some microcline), with <b>nepheline,</b> sodalite, cancrinite and calcite. The mafic minerals, when present, are magnetite and an iron-rich variety of biotite (lepidomelane).|$|E
50|$|Macroscopic {{aspects of}} <b>nepheline</b> syenite {{are similar to}} those of granite. The {{presence}} of <b>nepheline</b> and absence of quartz are the fundamental difference. Biotite is generally of low content and the main mafic minerals are clinopyroxene (±) and amphibole (±). The macroscopic colour is grey, being little darker than granite. There is high-grade metamorphic rock originated from <b>nepheline</b> syenite that is characterized by gneiss texture of very rare occurrence. It is called <b>nepheline</b> syenite gneiss or litchfieldite. An example is found at Canaã village, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.|$|E
50|$|The {{low index}} of {{refraction}} and the feeble double refraction in <b>nepheline</b> are nearly {{the same as in}} quartz; but since in <b>nepheline</b> the sign of the double refraction is negative, while in quartz it is positive, the two minerals are readily distinguished under the microscope. An important determinative character of <b>nepheline</b> is the ease with which it is decomposed by hydrochloric acid, with separation of gelatinous silica (which may be readily stained by coloring matters) and cubes of salt. For this reason, a clear crystal of <b>nepheline</b> becomes cloudy when immersed in acid.|$|E
50|$|Ditroite: Ditroite derives {{its name}} from Ditrau, Transylvania, Romania. It is {{essentially}} a microcline, sodalite and cancrinite variety of <b>nepheline</b> syenite. It contains also orthoclase, <b>nepheline,</b> biotite, aegirine, acmite.|$|E
50|$|At {{very low}} degrees of partial melting a silica undersaturated melt is produced, forming a <b>nepheline</b> syenite, where {{orthoclase}} {{is replaced by}} a feldspathoid such as leucite, <b>nepheline</b> or analcime.|$|E
