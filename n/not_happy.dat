5|$|According {{to a story}} relayed by Bret Hart on the TSN sports show Off The Record, Hart was {{originally}} supposed to wrestle Hulk Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. However, the match did not happen because Hogan changed his mind, as he was supposedly <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> with the planned finish. As a result, Hogan lost the belt to Yokozuna at King of the Ring 1993 instead.|$|E
5|$|After the {{convention}} many Conservative Democrats, though <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> at Tillman's victory, acknowledged him {{as head of}} the state party. Those who submitted to Tillman's rule included Hampton and Butler, the state's two U.S. senators. In his campaign, Tillman promoted support for Clemson, establishment of a state women's college, reapportionment of the state legislature (then dominated by the lowcountry counties), and ending the influence of corporation lawyers in that body.|$|E
5|$|Both the McCain and Obama campaigns {{released}} light-hearted {{statements about}} the prank. However, a McCain campaign advisor said that behind the scenes, aides and advisors to the campaign were <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> that the pranksters were able to lie their way up to Palin, or with the publicity Palin received because of the call.|$|E

5|$|He {{returned}} to Rome and was consul {{for a second}} time in 7BC, and in 6BC was granted tribunician power (tribunicia potestas) and control in the East, all of which mirrored positions that Agrippa had previously held. However, despite these successes and despite his advancement, Tiberius was <b>not</b> <b>happy.</b>|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Adobe, for the Adobe Imagination Challenge, Cuomo revealed that Adobe Photoshop was used to digitally alter the cover. Cuomo stated that, while the band liked the chosen band photo for the cover, Matt Sharp was <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> with the way his head looked. The Geffen Art Director used Photoshop to swap out the head with one from another shot.|$|E
5|$|Countess Sofia Shuvalova (1825–15 August 1879), the {{daughter}} of Prince Mikhail and Princess Elizaveta. In 1844, she married Count Andrei Shuvalov, the owner of Pargolovo (not {{to be confused with}} another branch of the Shuvalov family whose family seat was the Schloss Ruhenthal in Courland). The marriage was <b>not</b> <b>happy,</b> inducing her to live separately from her husband, who died in the house of another woman in 1876. From the 1850s Sofia and her children used Alupka as a country retreat, occupying the long West Wing now named after them, the Shuvalov Wing, while her brother Prince Semyon occupied the remainder of the palace.|$|E

30|$|To measure {{subjective}} well-being, two-items {{were adopted}} from {{the psychological and}} subjective well-being questionnaire (Samman, 2007). The two items adopted for this study measure overall life satisfaction and happiness. The items are “In general, {{would you say that}} you are satisfied with your life” (responses include: very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very satisfied, and not at all satisfied); and “Taking all things together, would you say you are” (responses include: very <b>happy,</b> rather <b>happy,</b> <b>not</b> very <b>happy,</b> <b>not</b> at all <b>happy).</b> These items had a good reliability (α[*]=[*]. 87).|$|R
5|$|Fleming was <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> {{with the}} book, {{owing to the}} {{reactions}} by critics and fans, and attempted to suppress elements of it where he could: he blocked a paperback edition in the United Kingdom and only gave permission for the title to be used when he sold the film rights to Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, rather than any aspects of the plots. However, a British paperback edition was published after his death, and the Bond film character of Jaws is loosely based {{on one of the}} characters in the book.|$|E
5|$|Hope survived {{being shot}} by police {{as a youth}} to become a New York-based {{musician}} who recorded with several emerging stars in the mid-1950s, including trumpeter Clifford Brown, and saxophonists John Coltrane, Lou Donaldson, Jackie McLean, and Sonny Rollins. A long-term heroin user, Hope had his license to perform in New York's clubs withdrawn after a drug conviction, so he moved to Los Angeles in 1957. He was <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> during his four years on the West Coast, but had some successful collaborations there, including with saxophonist Harold Land.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Ian Gillan {{announced}} the band would fold, as {{he needed to}} rest his damaged vocal cords. The tone and style of his singing changed considerably when he eventually returned. His voice had a more nasal tone and this can be heard on albums he has made from 1983 to the present day. His use of multi-tracked backing vocals also became highly prominent. The rest of the band Gillan, particularly McCoy and Towns, were <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> at the sudden disbanding of the group so soon after the success of Magic, and sued Gillan for royalties.|$|E

Other children, gaily dressed, were propped upon cushions and fed with sugar-plums. Yet {{the children of the}} rich were <b>not</b> <b>happier</b> than those playing with the dust and pebbles, it seemed to Claus.|$|R
5|$|In August and September, {{the first}} {{screenshots}} of Duke Nukem Forever were released in PC Gamer. However, 3D Realms {{did not receive}} the Quake II engine code until November 1997, and the earlier screenshots were mock-ups with the Quake engine that the team had made in their spare time. 3D Realms unveiled the first video footage of Duke Nukem Forever using the Quake II engine at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) conference. The trailer showed Duke fighting {{on the back of}} a moving truck and firefights with aliens. While critics were impressed, Broussard was <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> with the progress being made.|$|E
5|$|Khalid {{argued that}} he had conquered the city by force. Abu Ubaidah {{maintained}} the city had capitulated, through the peace agreement between him and Thomas. The corps commanders discussed the situation, and reportedly told Khalid that the peace agreement must be honored. Their rationale had logic: if other Byzantines in Syria heard that the Muslims had given a guarantee of safety to a surrendered city and then had slaughtered those whose safety had been guaranteed, no other city would ever surrender to the Muslims. This would make the task of conquering Syria immeasurably more difficult. Khalid, though <b>not</b> <b>happy,</b> agreed to honor the peace agreement.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1944, Cariappa was {{promoted}} to Brigadier, but was not given the command of a brigade as expected. Instead, he {{became a member of}} the Reorganisation Committee chaired by Lieutenant General Sir Henry Willcox. Though Cariappa was <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> with the appointment initially, and protested to the Military Secretary, the experience proved to helpful when he took over as the C-in-C four years later. The committee closely worked with the General HQ and Viceroy's Secretariat. This gave the British hierarchy a chance to assess Cariappa.|$|E

5|$|Seven offered Johns the 10.30pm Thursday timeslot, which Johns had {{the option}} of declining owing to a clause in his contract. Co-host Webcke was <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> with the late time, and Johns' {{producers}} perceived that there may be difficulty in booking guests at that time. Consequently, Johns declined the offer and sat out 2011 on full pay. It has also been suggested that success of The Matty Johns Show depended on the success of related AFL show The Bounce, which failed in 2010. The future of The Matty Johns Show is currently unclear.|$|E
5|$|The Austro-Hungarian Navy's U-boat fleet at the {{beginning}} of World War I consisted of six largely experimental submarines, two of which were not operational. When it became apparent that the war would not be a short one, Austria-Hungary moved to bolster their U-boat fleet by seizing the plans for the Danish Havmanden class submarines, three of which had been built at Whitehead’s in Fiume. Although the Austro-Hungarian Navy was <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> with the design, which was largely obsolete, it was the only design for which plans were available and which could be begun immediately in domestic shipyards. The Austro-Hungarian Navy unenthusiastically placed orders for four boats on 27 March 1915.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-founders Trey Parker and Matt Stone, along with writer Philip Stark.

The duo were <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> with the episode, particularly the ending, and were surprised by the positive response it received from fans. Parker said he also wanted the episode to convey, in part, that Halloween is a positive holiday for children.|$|E

5|$|At Massive Dynamic, Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes to {{the team}} that Observers are time travelers, {{as they have been}} {{documented}} during several major events in history. They write in an incomprehensible language, and the number of Observer sightings has increased over the past few months, leaving the team wondering why. Meanwhile, August visits the other Observers, who are <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> that he saved a girl who was supposed to die in the plane crash. To correct his mistake, they send Donald Long (Paul Rae), an assassin affiliated with the Observers to correct August's actions. In an attempt to save Christine, August sends a secret message to Walter. During the meeting, August reveals Christine will die because she is not important; Walter tells August that he has to make her important.|$|E
5|$|Dunne {{had hoped}} that by moving to New York to write full-time, {{he would be able}} to greatly expand his output, and he signed to do several projects, {{including}} a play featuring Mr. Dooley, and for a series of third-person stories featuring Molly Donahue, Bridgeport's resident suffragist. But Dunne found that he could not increase his production, and that some of the Dooley projects were ill-suited to the character: the play went unwritten and the Molly Donahue stories were abandoned after four pieces. Dooley appears as a character in some of them. Fanning found them unsatisfactory, with a misplaced Dooley, deprived of his bar and control of the dialogue. Dunne was <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> with them either: a note from the author appeared in the Ladies' Home Journal after the fourth piece was published there, alleging ill-health and dissatisfaction with the product.|$|E
