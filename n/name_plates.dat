5|$|After its sale to the Royal Scot Locomotive and General Trust, 70000 was {{overhauled}} at Crewe {{and returned}} to the main line in 2011 (its 60th anniversary), initially in unlined black without <b>name</b> <b>plates</b> as originally outshopped in 1951 (the plates were first fitted for the Festival of Britain later that year).|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{signs and}} <b>name</b> <b>plates</b> were made bilingual (Chinese and Manchu), {{and the main}} part of the Empress's {{official}} bedchamber, the Hall of Earthly Tranquility, became a Shamanist shrine.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the name}} Tornado was chosen and {{nameplates}} manufactured {{long before the}} locomotive was completed, during commissioning and test running the nameplates were not attached. By railway convention, the locomotive is officially known by her number until the <b>name</b> <b>plates</b> are affixed.|$|E
25|$|On May 24, the new <b>name</b> <b>plate</b> {{unveiled}} by Chen Shui-bian {{was taken}} {{down by the}} MOE. The ministry cited the costly efforts to have a constant police guard at the <b>name</b> <b>plate</b> as {{the primary reason for}} its removal. A veteran was seen spitting on the new <b>name</b> <b>plate</b> that prompted the 24-hour police presence.|$|R

25|$|The gates {{have four}} rough-cut coursed {{sandstone}} pillars, 2.9m high, the outer {{two of which}} are surmounted with marble globelike finials. Marble <b>name</b> <b>plates</b> with leaded lettering give lists of those from the district who fought in the First World War and returned. Iron swinging gates allow vehicular traffic between the inner piers and pedestrian traffic between these and the outer piers.|$|E
25|$|This colour-coding also {{occurs on}} a member's name plate. For {{administrative}} officers of all grades and Special Constables, their <b>name</b> <b>plates</b> are gold. Volunteers in Policing wear black nameplates. Civilian staff are not issued with badges; however, Special Constables and civilian forensic staff are issued with warrant cards. Everyone else such as plainclothes police officers is issued an Identification Certificate.|$|E
25|$|This underground, deep-level {{station has}} two tracks and one narrow island platform. Located at the {{southern}} end of the Rutgers Street Tunnel, it has round deep-bore walls with matte-finish white brick tiling and purple tile border; this tiling scheme is also present on the large, circular platform columns at the center of the station. The standard I-beam columns are painted blue with alternating ones having black <b>name</b> <b>plates</b> in white lettering.|$|E

25|$|Initially {{the field}} {{intelligence}} units inspected downed aircraft, but <b>name</b> <b>plates</b> were in Japanese and serial numbers {{were designed to}} be misleading, and few Allied field intelligence personnel read and understood Japanese. In many instances, the ATAIU relied on the assistance of indigenous work crews to retrieve the downed aircraft from remote areas and transport them to the coast, often dragging them through swamps or floating them down rivers on rafts.|$|E
25|$|During April 1931, no. 2351 hauled {{a special}} train {{conveying}} the Governor-General of South Africa, His Excellency the Earl of Athlone and Princess Alice. The Governor-General and the Princess travelled on the footplate from Cato Ridge to Umlaas and expressed keen delight at the experience, {{which led to}} the Princess granting the SAR permission to name the locomotive on which she had travelled after her. The <b>name</b> <b>plates</b> were affixed to the cabsides above the number plates.|$|E
25|$|Uniforms {{will almost}} always bear the {{insignia}} of Fire Exploring and/or {{the fire department}} they run out of. Class A uniforms can bear the American Flag shoulder badge, the official Fire Explorers badge, and sometimes the badge of the department they represent and various pins like <b>name</b> <b>plates</b> etc. The Class B uniform T-shirt will be a simple Explorers or fire department logo printed in the shirt. Turnout gear {{may or may not}} have much more than the name of the Explorer printed on the back on the jacket.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the signal}} boxes on the line bear {{original}} cast iron GWR <b>name</b> <b>plates,</b> with the sole exception being at Bridgnorth which has a replica. The SVR Kidderminster's name plate was recovered from another signal box that formerly stood on the up end of the down platform at Kidderminster station (Network Rail). The lever frame from the same signal box was reused at Arley, which has an LNWR signal box, originally from Yorton after the original was demolished. The replica name plate at Bridgnorth is made of fibre glass, {{although it is not}} known if it was moulded from the original or even if the original still exists.|$|E
500|$|The Qing rulers {{changed the}} names {{on some of the}} {{principal}} buildings, to emphasise [...] "Harmony" [...] rather than [...] "Supremacy", made the <b>name</b> <b>plates</b> bilingual (Chinese and Manchu), and introduced Shamanist elements to the palace.|$|E
500|$|Both {{platforms}} have {{a medium}} Cerulean Blue tile band {{with a black}} border with small [...] "GRAND" [...] captions in white lettering on a black background beneath them.

2500|$|Crashed Enemy Aircraft Reports (CEARs) were {{systematically}} {{compiled from}} April 1943. In February 1944, {{it was agreed}} that production data on enemy equipment was essential, and more extensive reports detailed the age and condition of captured equipment to give an indication of the general state of the Japanese war economy, paying particular attention to the <b>name</b> <b>plates</b> and markings which gave information on the manufacturers. Eventually a special unit known as [...] "JAPLATE" [...] was created to conduct this task, and 6,336 intact <b>name</b> <b>plates</b> or their details were collected.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lower level}} {{featured}} two high-speed escalators to the mezzanine, and three staircases to the upper-level platform. The walls featured 1950s-era cream tiles, a purple and black tile band, and white mosaic <b>name</b> <b>plates</b> with black [...] "42ND ST" [...] text.|$|E

2500|$|Gardiner {{states that}} few parts of either ship bore the name, {{other than the}} easily removed lifeboats, bell, compass binnacle, and <b>name</b> <b>plates.</b> [...] Everything else was {{standard}} White Star issue and was interchangeable between the two ships, and other vessels in the White Star fleet. While all other White Star Line Ships had their name engraved into the hull, the Titanic alone had its name riveted over top. In recent pictures of the wreck depicting a spot where two riveted plates that had spelled Titanic fell off, the letters MP appear to be stamped into the hull.|$|E
2500|$|Later, Prescision Scale Models {{produced}} {{a range of}} the engines in both in-service and preserved formats and liveries, including features like the extended coal bunker on preserved engines, <b>name</b> <b>plates</b> and crests as appropriate and other details. 12 units each of coal burners 700, 711, 724, 753 and 769 were released, along with 20 units each of 719 and 748 as oil burners. 30 units of R704 in its Glasgow Exhibition scheme were included, along with [...] "As Preserved" [...] R707 (25 units), R761 (20 units), R766 (25 units, green, with cab window wipers and radio antennae), and five models of R770 in V/Line grey with orange; a wholly fictional locomotive and livery. The instruction manual notes that R761 had black lining added to the smoke deflectors in 1988 and R766 lost is white cab roof and that these variants are not modelled.|$|E
2500|$|For the 2007–08 season, the Islanders {{redesigned}} {{their uniforms}} as all NHL teams changed {{over to the}} Reebok Edge system. This new jersey resembled the prior design but included uniform numbers on the right chest above the logo. The <b>name</b> <b>plates</b> were also in two colored format: white on orange on the navy blue home jersey and navy blue on orange on the white road jersey. The sleeves on both jerseys were orange, with a wide navy stripe above a thin white stripe at the elbow. The jerseys had a thin stripe tracing around the shoulders, and featured [...] "retro" [...] laces at the neck. Their third jersey was a royal blue throwback design resembling the jersey worn from 1972 to 1977, with white letters and numerals (as worn from 1973 on; the team wore orange numerals on the blue jerseys in their inaugural season). The logo on the jersey features four stripes on the hockey stick instead of the original three, another nod to the championship teams of 1980–83.|$|E
