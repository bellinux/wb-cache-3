40|$|Abstract Sterol {{regulatory}} element binding protein- 1 and - 2 (SREBP- 1 and - 2) are key transcription {{factors involved}} in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids.

In the present work we will review the effects of rTMS on glutamate neurotransmission which in turn induce persistent changes in synaptic activity.

30|$|The {{in vitro}} {{evaluation}} {{was performed on}} pancreas of human and NHP, firstly due to the strong translational value of this assay and secondly since previous <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>rodent</b> beta cell line INS- 1 indicated low binding [3].

50|$|Furthermore, STAT1 and STAT2 are {{essential}} {{factors in the}} cellular antiviral and adapative immune defenses. PIAS proteins and other regulators are necessary for homeostasis and for fine tuning the immune response. PIAS proteins regulate STAT transcription through several mechanisms, and genetic <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>rodents</b> have shown that PIAS1 plays an important physiological role in STAT1 regulation. Many of the 60 proteins that PIAS protein family is believed to interact with are immune regulatory factors.|$|R

To date, however, human lung stem/progenitor cells remain elusive (Kajstura et al., 2011). Given the vast differences between human and mouse in the development, tissue architecture (e.g., lobulation and branching pattern) and cell composition of the respiratory system, existing information <b>in</b> the <b>rodents</b> may not be directly translated into humans.

40|$|The Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VKM) has on {{a request}} from the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (Mattilsynet) {{performed}} a health risk assessment of the new insecticide Plenum 50 WG containing the new active substance pymetrozine.
