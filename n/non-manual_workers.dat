That same year, a special regulation came into force for District Master Chimney Sweeps, making them fully insurable under the Craftsman's Insurance Scheme. An increase was made in tax-free allowances for children, which enabled 1,000,000 families to claim an allowance for the second child, compared to 300,000 families previously. The Second Modification and Supplementation Law (1970) increased the allowance for the third child from DM 50 to DM 60, raised the income-limit for the second child allowance from DM 7,800 to DM 13,200; subsequently increased to DM 15,000 by the third modification law (December 1971), DM 16,800 by the fourth modification law (November 1973), and to DM 18,360 by the fifth modification law (December 1973). A flexible retirement age after 62 years was introduced (1972) for invalids and handicapped persons, and social assistance was extended to those who previously had to be helped by their relatives. From 1971, special subventions were provided to enable young farmers to quit farming “and facilitate their entry into the non-agricultural pension system by means of back payments.” ...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{analysis}} of glass waste generation rates from a sample of households distributed throughout the UK is presented. The effects of household size, age profile, and social class were evaluated in the study. The greatest explanatory value (r 2 = 0. 17) was obtained when households were classified into three categories: households with one person resident, <b>non-manual</b> <b>worker</b> households {{with more than one}} person resident, and manual worker households with more than one person resident. At a mean of 28. 9 kg per household per annum, annualised glass waste generation rates were lowest among one-person households and highest (86. 7 kg per household per annum) among <b>non-manual</b> <b>worker</b> households with more than one person resident. Coefficients arising from the analysis were used to predict household glass waste generation rates in 39 electoral wards in Birmingham. A model developed earlier by The Open University to predict the spatial distribution of glass recycled by households was also used to predict the quantity of glass taken to bottle bank sites by households in each of the 39 yards. Used in conjunction, the two models yielded estimates of the quantity of glass collected as waste in each of the 39 wards...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Type of work {{might be}} related to insulin {{resistance}} and the metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, scant data are available. We performed this study to investigate whether the prevalence of MetS and insulin resistance differed according to occupation in middle-aged men. Materials and Methods: In all, 2, 348 men in their 40 s∼ 50 s who had participated in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey IV were included and were classified into two groups according to the type of work (manual <b>worker</b> vs. <b>non-manual</b> <b>worker).</b> Diagnosis of MetS required satisfying three or more of the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Fasting insulin, the glucose/insulin ratio (G/I ratio), and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were used to estimate the insulin resistance. We used the Mann-Whitney test, χ 2 tests, multiple linear regression test, and logistic regression analyses to examine the relationships. Results: Age was significantly higher in the manual worker group. Body mass index was significantly lower in the manual worker group. Rates of current smoking and frequent drinking were higher in the manual worker group. In terms of surrogate marker...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the prevalence of central obesity among adults with normal BMI and its association with metabolic diseases in Jilin Province, China. A population-based cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} 2012 in Jilin Province of China. Information was collected by face to face interview. Descriptive data analysis and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) of prevalence/frequency were conducted. Log-binomial regression analyses were used to find the independent factors associated with central obesity and to explore the adjusted association between central obesity and metabolic diseases among adults with normal BMI. Among the adult residents with normal BMI in Jilin Province, 55. 6 % of participants with central obesity self-assessed as normal weight and 27. 0 % thought their body weight were above normal. 12. 7 % of central obesity people took methods to lose weight, while 85. 3 % didn't. Female, older people and <b>non-manual</b> <b>worker</b> had higher risk to be central obesity among adults with normal BMI. Hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia were significantly associated with central obesity among adults with normal BMI, the PRs were 1. 337 (1. 224 - 1. 461), 1. 323 (1. 193 - 1. 456) and 1. 261 (1. 152 - 1. 381) separately when adjusted for gender, age and BMI.

40|$|In {{order for}} {{organizations}} {{to be fully}} innovative, the implication {{of different kinds of}} employees in innovative activities is crucial. Innovation should become mainstream in the company with an active role for manual and <b>non-manual</b> routine <b>workers.</b> Using the survey results from employees of five different industries from the Flemish region of Belgium, this study researches the extent in which routine employees are engaged in innovative activities, using the concept of ‘innovation mainstreaming’. Based on data on the innovative behavior and workplace creativity of various kinds of employees, several hypotheses on inter- and intra-industry differences are tested. The results show that innovation is not routine in most industries and is mostly a privilege of the higher level employees. Routine workers behave significantly less innovative in all industries. Nevertheless, great differences exist between the researched industries, both regarding the overall importance of employee innovativeness, as for the intra-industry differences between different types of employees. Based on these insights, a taxonomy was developed distinguishing between sectors with ‘elite innovation’, ‘innovation mainstreaming’, ‘paternalistic, non-innovative’ and ‘equal, non-innovative’ regimes. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The {{aim of this}} {{analysis}} of the French Cooperative PAARC (Pollution Atmosphérique et Affections Respiratoires Chroniques) survey, was to test whether occupational exposures to dusts, gases, or chemical fumes or to specific hazards, estimated by job exposure matrices, were related to a decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1). METHODS [...] The most recent occupation was recorded in adults, aged 25 - 59, from <b>non-manual</b> <b>worker</b> households. Analysis was restricted to 10, 046 subjects whose occupation was encountered at least 10 times {{in the study and}} who performed good FEV 1 tracings. From occupational title, exposures to dusts, gases, and chemical fumes, and to specific hazards were classified in three categories (no, low, and high) with a British, a French, and an Italian job exposure matrix. Specific hazards were analysed for the British and French job exposure matrices for the same 42 specific dusts, gases, and chemical fumes. To limit spurious associations, a selection of seven hazard groups and 12 specific hazards was set {{before the start of the}} analysis. Based on the consistency of the relations according to sex and the British and French job exposure matrices, associations of age, height, city, and smoking adjusted FEV 1 score with occupational exposures were classified as very likely, possible, or unlikely. RESULTS [...] For the three job exposure matrices and both sexes clear exposure-response relations between the level of exposure to dusts, gases, and chemical fumes, and a decrease in FEV 1 were found. Associations with FEV 1 were classified as very likely for known hazards such as organic dusts and textile dusts, and not previously recognised hazards such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and detergents, and as possible for solvents, waxes and polishes, and diesel fumes. Associations found for PAHs and solvents were confirmed by the Italian job exposure matrix. Associations remained significant in women, but not in men, after adjustment for educational level. CONCLUSIONS [...] Hypotheses have been generated for exposure to detergents, PAHs, and solvents, but they need to be interpreted with caution before replication. Significant associations found for known risk factors with a decrease in FEV 1 are arguments for the validity of the matrices. Despite the expected limitations of job exposure matrices, these results encourage further work to improve exposure assessment by job exposure matrices...|$|R
40|$|Data {{drawn from}} Population Census of Great Britain suggest {{that both the}} images of proletarianisation and upward shift of the class {{structure}} are over-generalised. Shift-share analysis {{is used for the}} period 1981 - 1991 to explore the complex interactions between changes in class composition within industrial sectors, change in the relative size of sectors and sex composition shifts (within classes, within sectors and within class/sector categories). For example, sector shifts explain change in numbers of self-employed professionals and semi- skilled manual workers but changes in class composition within sectors account for changes in numbers of managers, <b>non-manual</b> ancillary <b>workers</b> and artists, unskilled workers and own account workers other than professionals. Change in class composition does not account for the change in the sex ratios within classes. Although sector shifts contribute to a decline of the male/female ratio in most classes, this process is uneven, with both declining male dominated and growing female dominated sectors, whose effect is partly counterbalanced by growing male dominated and declining female dominated sectors.

50|$|According to Jemielniak, {{knowledge}} enterprises {{have emerged}} due {{to changes in}} the global economy, which throughout decades has been giving greater priorities to services. The emergence of knowledge companies is also called as a symptom of the third industrial revolution where boundaries between owners of production resources, and workers. On the example of IBM {{it can be seen that}} such a change have influenced the structure of income of companies. In 1924, IBM’s profits were generated by leasing of manufacturing equipment in 96%, while punched cards were responsible for 4% of the profit. In 1970’s, 80% of profit came from equipment divisions, 15% from software division and 5% from services. In 1990’s services contributed to 30% of IBM’s profits, later in 2007 it was already 45% that the company had earned from rendering services, and 20% from software. This example only reflects the overall change, that is manifested by the reversed proportion between tangible and intangible assets of companies. This evolution has forced a shift in the access to these resources from manual to <b>non-manual</b> (knowledge) <b>workers.</b> Also decision making power is handed in top-down, from owners, and top managers to mid-managers and specialists. These developments accompany the emergence and growing importance of knowledge enterprises.|$|R

40|$|The {{enlargement}} of the European Union (EU) in May 2004 produced a very significant wave of immigration to the United Kingdom {{that is likely to}} continue to impact its labour market in forthcoming years. Polish migrants were by far the largest cohort of the new entrants. This paper complements previous work that has begun to establish the characteristics and labour market performance of migrants from the new member states who have entered the United Kingdom. This paper uses a unique micro-level data base to investigate the labour market evolution of Polish migrants in the UK labour market. We find that in the first UK job returns to human capital were negligible. However, for the current job an extra year of education increases the weekly gross wage by 3. 2 per cent. There is evidence of a gender differential in pay in both jobs and that older workers are paid more than their younger counterparts but this effect becomes insignificant in the current job. We find that hours worked is a significant factor in wage determination. However, the influence of hours worked on wages declined by approximately 38 per cent between the first and current job. Results from multinomial logit models suggest that over-time there is some “match” between the occupational groupings that these workers were attached to in Poland and the United Kingdom. We also find evidence that the use of employment agencies by some of these workers increases the likelihood of employment in skilled manual and <b>non-manual</b> occupations. <b>Workers</b> who have had supervisory responsibility in the United Kingdom {{are more likely to be}} in professional or intermediate occupations...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} earnings differentials and the pay of CEOs of 186 British companies between 1970 and 1990. We find that (i) changes in the differential between the 90 th and 50 th weekly earnings percentiles for <b>non-manual</b> adult male <b>workers</b> explain changes {{in the level of}} real CEO salary and bonus in our sample of companies; (ii) changes in this differential also explain changes in the elasticity of CEO pay to firm size; (iii) broader measures of earnings inequality do a far worse job explaining changes in both the level and the firm size elasticity of CEO pay; (iv) fitting the model on data for 1970 - 83 and predicting pay levels for the period starting with the widespread adoption of executive share option schemes in 1984, our model essentially continues to predict CEO salary plus bonus, and fails to account for the additional compensation represented by the new share options. We conclude firstly that top executive pay prior to 1984 was a stable function of both firm size and earnings differentials lower on the administrative ladder, consistent with a hypothesis advanced by Herbert Simon in 1957; and secondly that the use of share options from 1984 onward represents not simply a change in the mode of top executive compensation, but a structural break in the relationship between the pay of top executives and that of their subordinates. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1976, UK wages were {{amongst the}} lowest in Western Europe, being half of West German rates and two-thirds of Italian rates. In addition, while {{educational}} opportunities for working-class people had widened significantly {{since the end of}} the Second World War, a number of developed countries came to overtake Britain in some educational indicators. By the early 1980s, some 80% to 90% of school leavers in France and West Germany received vocational training, compared with 40% in the United Kingdom. By the mid-1980s, over 80% of pupils in the United States and West Germany and over 90% in Japan stayed in education until the age of eighteen, compared with barely 33% of British pupils. In 1987, only 35% of 16- to 18-year-olds were in full-time education or training, compared with 80% in the United States, 77% in Japan, 69% in France, and 49% in the United Kingdom. There also remained gaps between manual and <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers</b> in areas such as fringe benefits and wage levels.

40|$|Background : Historically, the French Canadian {{population}} of Quebec, Canada, {{is known for}} its high fertility, which lasted well into the 20 th century, and for its late fertility transition. Within Quebec, regions such as Saguenay are known for having experienced an even more delayed fertility transition. Objective : In Quebec, as elsewhere, various factors modulated the transition, and differential behaviors and timing can be observed across socioeconomic groups. These factors are studied here {{in the context of the}} Saguenay region, where particularly rich data are available. The region was mostly rural at first, but industrialization and urbanization occurring since the beginning of the 20 th century allow us to study socioeconomic reproductive differentials before and during the transition. Methods : To do so, we rely on the BALSAC database, which contains all church and civil records from the onset of colonization around 1840 up to 1971. In addition to the usual descriptive statistics, we use Cox models to analyze the probability of having a first birth and higher order births among four socioeconomic groups defined with HISCLASS coding. Results : The results demonstrate the late timing of the transition and a clear progression from the <b>non-manual</b> and skilled <b>workers,</b> who show the first signs of declining fertility during the 1930 s, to the farmers, who do the same only at the end of the 1950 s. As a result, socioeconomic fertility differentials widened during the transition period. Conclusions : Even in a context where the transition was significantly delayed compared to most other regions studied in this issue, some socioeconomic differentials were observed prior to the transition, and they widened during the transition due to the differential progression of contraceptive practices among couples...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{economic}} and social consequences of unemployment and long-term (or repeated) unemployment. The first two chapters are concerned with economic consequences. They study how unemployment affects the working of the labour market. The last two chapters are interested in social consequences. They look at whether future generations' outcomes are altered by their parents' unemployment. Chapter two uses data on UK regions over a period of 23 years to test the hypothesis that the composition of unemployment alters the dampening effect of unemployment on wages. Several specifications are estimated using dynamic panel data methods and are tested to check the robustness of the results. The hypothesis is verified for manual or unskilled workers, but not for <b>non-manual</b> or skilled <b>workers.</b> The next three chapters use the British National Child Development Study (NCDS). The third chapter studies the job search behaviour of individuals who declared themselves unemployed and looking for work when aged 23 years old. We define job search as the combination of three decisions: whether they have considered applying for a job which would mean moving house, which would have a lower pay than their previous job, or which would require a lower qualification. We find that using a model that incorporates the dependence of these decisions improves efficiency. Young people who have been unemployed before are found to accept mobility but not to alter their expectations on wages and skill content. In the fourth chapter, we want to determine whether the labour market situation of the parents influences in any way the social behaviour of children. The findings show that, controlling for - persistent - financial difficulties, the unemployment of the father during childhood seems to have a detrimental effect on his children's outcomes. There is some evidence that those who have a non-working mother during early childhood are better off than others, except in cases where the mother is single. The last chapter draws on the previous one and studies whether these effects can be translated into unfavourable outcomes in adult life, in particular social exclusion. A new index of social exclusion is constructed. We find that anti-social behaviour and social difficulties during childhood are associated with later risks of social exclusion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The aim of the originating project was to increase understanding {{of the past and}} possible future impact of increased international trade, mobility and investment on: i) Differences in income levels between countries (divergence or convergence, and - if convergence - levelling up or levelling down) ii) The relative and real wages of different sorts of 'skilled' workers This aim was addressed in four main ways. The first was to formalise ideas about the disaggregation of skilled workers, and the overlap between the concepts of skill and technology, by theoretical modelling. The second was to test hypotheses suggested by theory on evidence for all countries over the past 30 years. The third was to test hypotheses suggested by theory on evidence for skilled wages in developed countries over the past 30 years. The final way the objective was addressed was by testing the hypotheses suggested by theory against evidence from developed countries over the past two centuries. The data collection {{is the result of the}} data gathering exercise undertaken for this fourth approach. Main Topics : The dataset brings together a wide range of statistical information relating to patterns of globalisation, technology and wage inequality in a selection of now-developed countries between 1870 and 1970.

40|$|PURPOSE: Candidate {{risk factors}} for {{idiopathic}} rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) include heavy manual handling (requiring Valsalva's maneuver). We assessed incidence rates of surgically treated idiopathic RRD among manual workers, <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers</b> and housewives resident in Tuscany, Italy. METHODS: We retrieved all hospital discharge records bearing a principal diagnosis corresponding to RRD coupled with retinal surgery for any resident of Tuscany during 1997 - 2009. After elimination of repeated admissions and patients with coexistent, associated conditions (including recent trauma), subjects aged 25 - 59 years were classified as manual workers, <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers</b> or housewives. Population data were extracted from the 2001 census. RESULTS: We identified 1, 946 eligible cases (1, 142 men). Among men, manual workers experienced a 1. 8 -fold higher age-standardized rate per 100, 000 person-years than <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers</b> [17. 4 (95...|$|E

Among men, manual workers experienced a 1. 8 -fold higher age-standardized rate per 100, 000 person-years than <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers</b> [17. 4 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 16. 1 – 18. 7) vs. 9. 8 (95 % CI 8. 8 – 10. 8) ]. Age-standardized rates among women were 1. 9 -fold higher for manual workers [11. 1 (95 % CI 9. 8 – 12. 3) ] and 1. 7 -fold higher for housewives [9. 5 (95 % CI 8. 3 – 10. 8) ] than in <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers</b> [5. 7 (95 % CI 4. 8 – 6. 6) ]. Conclusions This large population-based study suggests that manual workers are affected by idiopathic RRD requiring surgical treatment more often than <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers.</b> The higher rates of surgically treated RRD experienced by manual workers are {{in accord with the}} hypothesis that heavy manual handling may have a causal role. <br/...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{increase}} in demand for <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers</b> in Italian manufacturing during the 1990 s. We find that within-firm skill upgrading is the main determinant of this shift in demand, whereas the reallocation of employment across firms reduces the relative demand for skills. Although the adjustment of skill premia is relatively small when referred to annual wages,hourly wage premia and skill intensity reveal substantial and offsetting contributions to wage responses. Within-firm skill upgrading is strongly and significantly related to investment in computers and R&D, suggesting skill biased technical change as the main explanation of {{the increase in}} the relative demand for <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Objectives We {{investigated}} {{the contribution of}} major coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors and job strain to occupational class differences in CHD incidence in a pooled-cohort prospective study in northern Italy. Methods 2964 men aged 25 - 74 from four northern Italian population-based cohorts were investigated at baseline and followed for first fatal or non-fatal CHD event (171 events). Standardised procedures were used for baseline risk factor measurements, follow-up and validation of CHD events. Four occupational classes were derived from the Erikson-Goldthorpe-Portocarero social class scheme: higher and lower professionals and administrators, <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers,</b> skilled and unskilled manual workers, and the self-employed. HRs were estimated with Cox models. Results Among CHD-free subjects, with <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers</b> as the reference group, age-adjusted excess risks were found for professionals and administrators (+ 84...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{prevalence}} of Metabolic Syndrome (MS) in an Indian industrial setup and to study disparity in occurrence of MS in a working population based on occupational status. Materials and Methods: Cross-sectional study of 651 employees who underwent periodic medical examination. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) definition of MS and International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) - 88 classification of occupations were used. Results: The overall crude prevalence of MS {{was found to be}} 18. 5 &#x 0025;. Nineteen percent of the <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers</b> and 18. 3 &#x 0025; of the manual workers suffered from MS. The single largest occupational category with MS was ISCO- 88 group 1, which included the managers and senior officials. However, no difference was found among the manual and <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers</b> in prevalence of MS...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} firm- level {{evidence on}} {{the dynamics of the}} relative demand for <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers</b> in Italian manufacturing during the 1990 s. The analysis provides a number of interesting results. First, within-firm skill upgrading is the main determinant of the increase in the non-manual wage bill share. By contrast, demand changes associated to trade have shifted employment away from skill-intensive firms. Second, while the relative number of hours worked by skilled workers within firms has risen, the hourly wage premium has fallen. Third, within-firm skill upgrading is strongly and significantly related to investment in computers and R&D, suggesting skill-biased technical progress as the main explanation for the increase in the relative demand for <b>non-manual</b> <b>workers.</b> Finally, the paper shows that failing to disaggregate annual wages into the number of hours worked and hourly wages, leads to underestimate the skill-bias of technical progress. wage differentials, skill bias, technical progress, globalization...|$|E
