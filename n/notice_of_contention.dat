5000|$|The District Court {{ruling was}} {{overturned}} on a direct {{appeal to the}} United States Supreme Court (see United States v. Miller). No brief was filed {{on behalf of the}} defendants, and the defendants themselves did not appear before the Supreme Court. Miller himself had been murdered one month prior to the Supreme Court's decision. No evidence that such a firearm was [...] "ordinary military equipment" [...] had been presented at the trial court (apparently because the case had been thrown out—at the defendants' request—before evidence could be presented), although two Supreme Court justices at the time had been United States Army officers during World War I and may have had personal knowledge of the use of such weapons in combat. The Supreme Court indicated it could not take judicial <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> such a <b>contention.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Günther was a {{faithful}} Catholic and a devout priest. His philosophical labours were {{at any rate}} a sincere and honest endeavour to promote the triumph of positive Christianity over those systems of philosophy which were inimical to it. But it is questionable whether he pursued the right course in disregarding the fruitful labours of Scholastic theology and philosophy-of which, like all who scorn them, he had but scanty knowledge-and permitting his thought, particularly in his natural philosophy, and his speculative method to be unduly influenced by those very systems (of Hegel and Schelling) which he combated. The {{fact is that the}} desired result was in no wise attained. The schools of philosophy which he thought he could compel, by turning their own weapons against them, to recognize the truth of Christianity, took practically no <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> his ardent <b>contentions,</b> while the Church not only was unable to accept his system as the true Christian philosophy and to supplant with it the Scholastic system, but was finally obliged to reject it as unsound.|$|R

40|$|Concurrent {{systems in}} which there is a known upper bound Δ on memory access time are considered. Two prototypical {{synchronization}} problems, mutual exclusion and consensus, are studied and solutions that have constant (i. e. independent of Δ and the total number of processes) time complexity in the absence <b>of</b> <b>contention</b> are presented. For mutual exclusion, in the absence <b>of</b> <b>contention,</b> a process needs only five accesses to the shared memory to enter its critical section, and in the presence <b>of</b> <b>contention,</b> the winning process may need to delay itself for 4 ΔΔ time units. For consensus, in absence <b>of</b> <b>contention,</b> a process decides after four accesses to the shared memory, and in the presence <b>of</b> <b>contention,</b> it may need to delay itself for Δ time units. 1 Introduction The possibility and complexity of synchronization in a distributed environment depends heavily on timing assumptions.

In order to fill this gap, this paper analyzes the performance of several commonly used locking primitives under low levels <b>of</b> <b>contention.</b> The costs predicted {{by a number of}} analysis methodologies and rules of thumb are compared to measurements taken on real hardware, thereby showing where each may be safely used. ...|$|R

30|$|Program {{analysis}} {{is also used}} to speed up transactions. Sloth [11] and Pyxis [10] are tools that use program analysis to reduce the network communication between the application and DBMS. QURO [42] tracks dependencies among transaction statements to reorder transaction execution for 2 PL. DORA [30] also partitions transaction codes to exploit intra-transaction parallelism provided by multi-core server for 2 PL. Majority of these techniques do not consider reordering transaction execution and thus cannot reduce delays for transaction pipeline. QURO seems the most related approach to PARE since both of them reorder transaction execution. However, two inappropriate design choices of QURO hinder transaction pipeline from boosting HFT applications: (1) QURO assumes fixed workloads and requires to sample the degrees <b>of</b> <b>contention</b> for each statement in advance. Unfortunately, workload sampling is prohibitive because each transaction is dynamically generated according to the timely business information in HFT market. (2) QURO estimates the degree <b>of</b> <b>contention</b> at statement level and by the delayed time. As discussed in Sect.  3.3, this underestimates the degree <b>of</b> <b>contention</b> and repeatedly obtains inconsistent degree <b>of</b> <b>contention.</b> In contrast, PARE estimates at physical operator level and counts the occurrence frequency <b>of</b> <b>contention.</b>|$|R

30|$|To {{obtain the}} degree <b>of</b> <b>contention</b> <b>of</b> a {{reordering}} block, we first estimate the degree <b>of</b> <b>contention</b> <b>of</b> each statement thereof {{and use the}} maximum as the reordering block’s degree <b>of</b> <b>contention.</b> In this way, we will not miss highly contended operations enclosed by reordering blocks with many less contended operations. Existing method uses waiting time and its variation on each statement to estimate the degree <b>of</b> <b>contention</b> [42]. This solution has two shortcomings: (1) the counter set for each unique statement underestimates the real degree <b>of</b> <b>contention</b> for the statement. For HFT application, each statement usually contains different parameters. For example, the SQL query for update(Alphabet, 30) is usually instantiated as update Stock set quantity -= 30, price = p where sid = Alphabet, where p is the latest price provided by user. Thus, many statements updating the same quantity and price fields are counted in different counters. (2) Estimating waiting time and its variance suffers from thrashing. This is because properly reordered highly contended operations will not wait for long time and thus are always categorized as less contended operations. Then, these operations will be placed {{to the end of}} the transaction and be considered as heavily contended operations again. To address these two issues, we propose an execution plan-based estimation which collects the occurrence of each object in a time sliding window.|$|R
