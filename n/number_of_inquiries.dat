25|$|A {{report by}} Helgerson's office {{completed}} {{in the spring of}} 2004 warned that some CIA-approved interrogation procedures appeared to constitute cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, as defined by the international Convention Against Torture.

Helgerson's office is reportedly nearing completion on a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiries</b> into CIA detention, interrogation, and renditions. Members of the House and Senate intelligence committees expressed concern about the inquiry, saying that it could undermine the inspector general's role as independent watchdog.

40|$|Abstract: Queries are {{frequently}} used by applications in dynamically formed mo-bile networks {{to discover and}} acquire information and services available in the sur-rounding environment. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> strategies exist, each of which em-bodies an approach to disseminating a query and collecting results. The choice <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> strategy has different tradeoffs under different operating conditions. There-fore, it is beneficial to allow a query-based application to dynamically adapt its in-quiry strategy to the changing environmental conditions. To promote development by non-expert domain programmers, we can automate the decision-making process associated with adapting the inquiry strategy. In this paper, we propose an architec-ture to support automated adaptative query processing for dynamic mobile environ-ments. The decision-support module of our architecture relies on an instance-based learning approach to support context-aware adaptation <b>of</b> the <b>inquiry</b> strategy...|$|R

In an interview, CAN's executive director emphasized that the label [...] "cult" [...] with regard to Landmark Education was not important; but rather greater scrutiny of its practices was needed. [...] Specifically, CAN stressed concerning characteristics, such as [...] "the long hours during which the participant is in the organization's total control, receiving input from only one source, removed from any support system except for the seminar group itself". [...] In 1994, Landmark Education Corporation sued the Cult Awareness Network for US$40 million, claiming that CAN had labeled Landmark Education as a cult. [...] The case itself involved a dispute over the legality and applicable usage of what Matthews termed [...] "cult indoctrination procedures". [...] CAN later settled and made a statement {{that it did not}} consider Landmark Education a cult, as part of the settlement agreement.|$|E
