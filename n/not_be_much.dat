5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E
25|$|Before {{using the}} laser, the {{ophthalmologist}} dilates the pupil and applies anaesthetic drops to numb the eye. In some cases, the doctor also may numb the area behind {{the eye to}} reduce discomfort. The patient sits facing the laser machine while the doctor holds a special lens on the eye. The physician can use a single spot laser or a pattern scan laser for two dimensional patterns such as squares, rings and arcs. During the procedure, the patient will see flashes of light. These flashes often create an uncomfortable stinging sensation for the patient. After the laser treatment, patients should be advised not to drive {{for a few hours}} while the pupils are still dilated. Vision will most likely remain blurry {{for the rest of the}} day. Though there should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> pain in the eye itself, an ice-cream headache like pain may last for hours afterwards.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of trying to shoot the moon, players attempt to discard high cards, especially high hearts or spades, and try to avoid winning points. This can either be accomplished by creating a void, or playing a high card last in a trick that has no points. Generally speaking, it is advantageous to play the highest card possible without winning the trick. Players particularly concentrate on getting rid of high cards in suits {{that they do not}} have padding low cards in. For example, if a player had A,5,4,3,2 the A would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> of an issue; they can play the four lower cards and hopefully exhaust other player's spades before being forced to play the A. In contrast, if they only had A, then they would be forced to play the A the first time spades were led, with the risk that another player will respond with the queen.|$|E

[...] Nevertheless, due to his {{premature}} death at age 66, he was survived by most of his friends. These included Adams, who although he blamed the pressures of Hay's office, where he was badgered by Roosevelt and many senators, for the Secretary of State's death, admitted that Hay had remained in the position because he feared being bored. [...] He memorialized his friend in the final pages of his autobiographical The Education of Henry Adams: with Hay's death, his own education had ended.|$|E
500|$|Spielberg {{accepted}} the script after finding it had several similarities {{to his personal}} life, including the divorce of his parents (Ray and Mary Ann's divorce), and because {{the plight of the}} fictional survivors reflects his own uncertainty after the devastation of the September 11 attacks. For Spielberg, the characters' stories of survival needed to be the main focus, as they featured the American mindset of never giving up. Spielberg described War of the Worlds as [...] "a polar opposite" [...] to Close Encounters, with that movie featuring a man leaving family to travel with aliens, while War of the Worlds focused on keeping the family together. At the same time, the aliens and their motivations would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> explored, as [...] "we just experience the results of these nefarious plans to replace us with themselves".|$|E

[...] He found that watching Age 13 with Graveyard Mountain Home as the soundtrack enhanced the film: [...] "Age 13 is not necessarily an enjoyable film to watch... but viewing it with the Chroma Key soundtrack makes an odd experience even odder yet wholly compelling, with a mysterious filmstrip allure that freezes a bygone era." [...] Conversely, Jablonski considered Age 13 as an enhancement to the music. [...] "Listening to the album stand alone for the first time you may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> impressed," [...] she said. [...] "The music is solemn and somewhat confusing as the tracks run from one to another without much build and in seemingly senseless patterns... Having previously seen or simultaneously watching Age 13 most definitely would help the listener along." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1972–73 Shero hired Mike Nykoluk as an {{assistant}} coach on a one-year tryout basis. Although assistant coaches are common today, Nykoluk was the first full-time assistant coach in the league, and the decision to hire him led to rumors that Shero must <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> of a coach if he needed help. However, with the additional help Shero guided the Flyers to their first winning season in franchise history, and Nykoluk stayed on as assistant throughout Shero's tenure. Prior to a game during the 72–73 season Shero wrote a quote about commitment on the dressing room blackboard, and the team won the game. From then on Shero wrote inspirational quotes prior to games. After finishing second in the West Division they faced off with the Minnesota North Stars whom they defeated 4-2 winning the first playoff series in Flyers history. [...] In the second round the Flyers matched up with the Montreal Canadiens, who defeated Philadelphia 4-1.|$|E
500|$|The Blair Witch Projects {{found footage}} film {{technique}} received near-universal praise by many and, {{though not the}} first to employ it, has been declared a milestone in film history due to its critical and box office success. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a total of four stars, and called it [...] "an extraordinarily effective horror film". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called it [...] "a groundbreaker in fright that reinvents scary for the new millennium". Todd McCarthy of Variety said, [...] "An intensely imaginative piece of conceptual filmmaking that also delivers the goods as a dread-drenched horror movie, The Blair Witch Project puts a clever modern twist on the universal fear of the dark and things that go bump in the night." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave a B grade, saying, [...] "As a horror picture, the film may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more than a cheeky game, a novelty with the cool, blurry look of an avant-garde artifact. But as a manifestation of multimedia synergy, it's pretty spooky." ...|$|E

500|$|Keith Law, a {{minor league}} talent {{evaluator}} for ESPN, derided Asche as a prospect both offensively and defensively, noting that he likely would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> of a power hitter and was a questionable defender. Nevertheless, Baseball America rated Asche as the Phillies' seventh-best prospect after the 2012 season. After the 2012 season, another analyst wrote that Asche had an [...] "average" [...] body for a baseball player, commented that while he had limited power potential, {{he could be a}} solid contact hitter because of quick hands and [...] "incredibly sound" [...] hitting mechanics, but was a [...] "terrible" [...] defender with a [...] "fringy arm". Subsequently, however, he improved defensively to become [...] "passable". In 2013, Asche played for the Lehigh Valley IronPigs of the Class AAA International League (IL). He was named to the IL team in the Triple-A All-Star Game. After batting [...]295 with 15 home runs and 68 RBIs for Lehigh Valley, and being named their Player of the Month for July, the Phillies promoted Asche to the major leagues on July 30. One writer found it [...] "mildly surprising" [...] that the Phillies called up Asche rather than Maikel Franco, a fellow third base prospect who most thought had far more potential than Asche.|$|E

The landmark event was not met with universal applause, with the London Times stating [...] "it would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> longer before the University of Durham was affiliated to the Zoo". After nearly a century of affiliation and with the prevailing winds of decolonization Fourah Bay became independent of the university in 1968 to form part of the University of Sierra Leone, while Codrington College retained its affiliation with the university until the 2000s.|$|E
