5|$|Schizophrenia {{is often}} {{described}} in terms of positive and <b>negative</b> (<b>or</b> deficit) symptoms. Positive symptoms are those that most individuals do not normally experience, but are present in people with schizophrenia. They can include delusions, disordered thoughts and speech, and tactile, auditory, visual, olfactory and gustatory hallucinations, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis. Hallucinations are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme. Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication.|$|E
5|$|The {{flatness}} problem (also {{known as}} the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric (FLRW). The universe may have positive, <b>negative,</b> <b>or</b> zero spatial curvature depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative, if its density {{is less than the}} critical density; positive, if greater; and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be flat.|$|E
5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is <b>negative</b> <b>or</b> positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E

5|$|Communications signals {{can be sent}} {{either by}} analog signals or digital signals. There are analog {{communication}} systems and digital communication systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously {{with respect to the}} information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form of noise is called additive noise, with the understanding that the noise can be <b>negative</b> <b>or</b> positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.|$|E
5|$|Every atom is {{composed}} of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made {{of one or more}} protons and typically a similar number of neutrons. Protons and neutrons are called nucleons. More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, that atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall <b>negative</b> <b>or</b> positive charge, respectively, and it is called an ion.|$|E
5|$|Some experts {{argue that}} exposing {{children}} to television {{at such an}} early age is taking technology too far or that parents are using BabyFirst as a digital babysitter. Parents in-turn refute that argument, claiming that experts have lost touch {{with the realities of}} raising a child. BabyFirst suggests the programming is intended to be watched by parents and their children together in an interactive way. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against exposing {{children under the age of}} two to television, while a 2003 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that most children under two years of age are already watching TV. According to The Washington Post, very little is known about whether young children watching television has a <b>negative</b> <b>or</b> positive effect on them.|$|E

Most of {{the studies}} [17, 29, 30, 32, 35, 36, 38 – 41] used these measures; authors in [16, 31] employed correct and incorrect cycle detection while [33] employed classification rate for quantifying the results.|$|R

5|$|The {{charge on}} {{electrons}} and protons is opposite in sign, hence {{an amount of}} charge may be expressed as being either <b>negative</b> <b>or</b> positive. By convention, the charge carried by electrons is deemed negative, and that by protons positive, a custom that originated {{with the work of}} Benjamin Franklin. The amount of charge is usually given the symbol Q and expressed in coulombs; each electron carries the same charge of approximately −1.6022×10−19coulomb. The proton has a charge that is equal and opposite, and thus +1.6022×10−19 coulomb. Charge is possessed not just by matter, but also by antimatter, each antiparticle bearing an equal and opposite charge to its corresponding particle.|$|E
5|$|Viralheat was {{a social}} media {{management}} tool with features for account management, monitoring, analytics and publishing. It tracks the number of mentions an individual or company receives on digital properties and analyzes factors such as influence, sentiment and language. The influence of a Twitter handle is measured based on followers, mentions, and retweets Sentiment is assessed as positive, <b>negative</b> <b>or</b> neutral. Viralheat's Human Intent tool labels social media participants as leads if it assesses that {{they are likely to}} consider purchasing a corresponding product. The software's analytics and monitoring can be filtered by location. Data from Viralheat can be exported into PDF files, Excel spreadsheets or onto a publicly available dashboard.|$|E
5|$|Red Dead Redemption {{makes use}} of a {{morality}} system where players {{have the ability to}} gain positive or negative honor. Honor can be gained by making morally positive choices, such as taking in an outlaw alive or saving a woman from a kidnapping. The player character's overall honor standard is lowered for committing crimes or other negative choices. This works in conjunction with another system, fame, which affects how people react based on Marston's honor status. If Marston has little honor, non-player characters will feel insecure around him. If he has a high amount of honor, other characters will usually greet him and feel safe around him. He will also receive discounts in some stores, more pay for jobs and other bonuses. A very low honor rating can result in a town's establishments closing their doors when Marston arrives. To combat this he can disguise himself by wearing a bandana when performing criminal acts; alternatively, a very <b>negative</b> <b>or</b> criminal reputation warrants the player a large amount of respect and steep discounts from bandits and fencers at criminal hideouts, such as Thieves' Landing.|$|E
