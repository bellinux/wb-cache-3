40|$|This work adds a {{quantitative}} description of distortion to the structured design method of <b>negative-feedback</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> It constitutes a power-series {{representation of the}} feedback amplifier, which may include dynamic (memory) effects, where the design parameters appear explicitly. These results have been incorporated into the systematic design method. It now includes design steps for calculating the required number of amplifying stages, and the optimal bias current allocation. The power-series representation of <b>negative-feedback</b> <b>amplifiers</b> models several properties of active devices. The effects of collector-base current tracking (current drive), high-level injection of BJTs, {{and the presence of}} base resistance influences on the nonlinear distortion performance are described. Furthermore, mobility reduction, and channel length modulation of FETs are modeled. Moreover, the power-series representation also allows the mismatch of balanced stages to be considered. This power-series representation explicitly states the conditions for achieving the desired nonlinear distortion performance of <b>negative-feedback</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> One of the main findings is that the current/voltage gain of an amplifying stage is more important than its intrinsic nonlinearity in this regard. The intrinsic nonlinearity of an amplifying stage is represented by nonlinearity coefficients. The coefficients are, in general, of the same order of magnitude for all technologies and configurations. Therefore, the ability of amplifying stages to contribute to the loop gain is more important. What is more, in contrast to common belief, applying local feedback does not improve the nonlinear distortion performance of <b>negative-feedback</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> The linearity loss can be slight, assuming that local feedback is applied to the amplifying stage that dominates the linearity performance. The least harmful place for local feedback is, therefore, often the output stage...|$|R

40|$|The {{information}} transfer capacity of <b>negative-feedback</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> and electronic circuits in general, {{is limited by}} three fundamental limitations being noise, bandwidth, and signal power. Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) is not a fundamental limitation, but it also hampers the {{information transfer}}. EMI may have such detrimental effects that malfunctioning of the electronic circuit occurs. This may result in loss of information, or worse, possibly dangerous situations. That is a reason why susceptibility to EMI is regulated by law. The ratio of the intended signal and the errors, the Signal-to-Error ratio (SER) {{can be regarded as}} a figure of merit of the signal handling performance of an amplifier for a given input signal and electromagnetic environment. EMI from out-of-band signals, i. e., signals with a frequency (much) higher than the bandwidth of the amplifier, may result in a DC shift and detection of the, in-band, low frequency envelope variations (envelope or `AM' detection) of the high frequency interference, caused by even-order nonlinearities in the active devices used. Specifically envelope detection may severely hamper the SER, since this will often be a signal in the pass band, while DC-shifts may not be in the pass band. This work focuses on reducing the errors introduced by the fundamental limitations and EMI in <b>negative-feedback</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> A systematic design approach for application specific <b>negative-feedback</b> <b>amplifiers</b> with specified SER is proposed in this work. It enables the designer to calculate noise, bandwidth, EMI, and the required bias parameters of the transistors used in application specific amplifiers {{in order to meet the}} SER requirements. micro-electronicsElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe design {{procedure}} of low-sensitivity active resistance-capacitance (RC) allpole filters, using impedance tapering, {{has already been}} published. The low-sensitivity filter sections already described in publication are class 4 (TT-SABB) Sallen and Key sections. In this paper class 3 (SAB) sections for low pole-Q realization are considered. Impedance tapering is applied on L-sections, which are situated in <b>negative-feedback</b> of operational <b>amplifier</b> in open-loop mode. L-sections are impedance scaled upwards, from the driving source to the negative amplifier input. Second-order band-pass filter is considered. Pole-Q factors for low-Q building blocks take their values up to, say, 5. The sensitivity to component tolerances of the circuit is shown to be small for any type of impedance tapering regardless of the gain-sensitivity product (GSP) value.

40|$|In <b>negative-feedback</b> <b>amplifier</b> design, {{electromagnetic}} interference (EMI) behavior is usually completely disregarded. EMI can, e. g., result in detection of low-frequency envelope {{variations of the}} usually high-frequency interfering signals. If the detected signals {{end up in the}} pass band of the <b>negative-feedback</b> <b>amplifier,</b> they cannot be distinguished from the intended signal any longer, so the signal-to-error ratio (SER) is reduced. Several measures can be taken to prevent unacceptable reduction of the SER, like applying filters, chokes, etc. In this paper, however, circuit design aspects are investigated. It is assumed that interference reaches the amplifier input and that the SER has to be assured by a proper design of the <b>negative-feedback</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Since EMI is related to nonlinear distortion, it {{is a function of the}} loop gain of the <b>negative-feedback</b> <b>amplifier.</b> For a given electromagnetic (EM) environment it is therefore possible to calculate the minimum loop gain required to reduce EMI to acceptable levels without filtering.

40|$|In this paper, the electromagnetic-interference {{effects of}} {{out-of-band}} signals on negative-feedback amplifiers are investigated. It {{is assumed that}} the interfering signals {{picked up at the}} input of the amplifier are dominant. Due to the nonlinear behavior of the active devices in the amplifier, unwanted dc shifts and amplitude-modulation (AM) detection may occur. Describing these effects is usually done by using the Volterra series. Although providing good results when used for analysis, methods to use the Volterra series for the design process are not yet mature enough. In this paper, a simple procedure for calculating AM detection is presented. An equivalent source at the input of the amplifier is introduced that accounts for the nonlinear effects. Because the characteristics of this source are computed as a function of design parameters, this procedure facilitates a synthesis approach for designing amplifiers with a lower susceptibility to AM detection. It is shown that the root locus of the amplifier transfer function has a large influence on the amount of AM detection and, therefore, on the electromagnetic compatibility.
