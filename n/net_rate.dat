Unlike the starlings in the previous example, bees maximize energy efficiency (energy gained per energy spent) rather than <b>net</b> <b>rate</b> of energy gain (net energy gained per time). This is because the optimal load predicted by maximizing <b>net</b> <b>rate</b> of energy gain is too heavy for the bees and shortens their lifespan, decreasing their overall productivity for the hive, as explained earlier. By maximizing energy efficiency, the bees are able to avoid expending too much energy per trip {{and are able to}} live long enough to maximize their lifetime productivity for their hive. In a different paper, Schmid-Hempel showed that the observed relationship between load size and flight time is well correlated with the predictions based on maximizing energy efficiency, but very poorly correlated with the predictions based on maximizing <b>net</b> <b>rate</b> of energy gain.|$|E

The adjusted <b>net</b> saving <b>rate</b> incorporated not just physical capital depreciation, but natural capital depletion and environmental damage, as well as including some human capital formation. In this paper, using a cross‐section of developing economies for 2001 – 2006, determinants of the adjusted <b>net</b> saving <b>rate</b> are estimated. For comparison, the same determinants for the gross national saving rate are estimated. Also, a basic Solow growth model is extended to incorporate natural resources and to justify a more comprehensive measure of savings, such as the adjusted <b>net</b> saving <b>rate,</b> for modeling economic growth.

LD 50 determinations showed inbred mouse strains of low, intermediate and high natural resistance, with BALB/c and B 10 strains the most susceptible, A/J the most resistant. Delayed (footpad) hypersensitivity was not by itself {{a measure of}} natural resistance. Resistant mouse strains sensitized either s. c. or i. v. with an attenuated salmonella strain showed positive 48 h footpad reactions when tested 8 days later with a salmonella extract, but three very susceptible strains also showed positive reactions. Determinations of the in vivo <b>net</b> growth <b>rate</b> of salmonellae in the liver and spleen during {{the first phase of}} the infection (up to day 4) arrange the different mouse strains into two categories of fast and slow <b>net</b> growth <b>rate.</b> All fast <b>net</b> growth <b>rate</b> strains are susceptible, but not all slow <b>net</b> growth <b>rate</b> strains are resistant. Besides slow <b>net</b> growth <b>rate,</b> resistance requires the participation of other factors appearing in the second phase of the infection (towards the end of the first week) probably involving the cellular immune response, which halts further bacterial growth. Not all slow <b>net</b> growth <b>rate</b> strains are equally capable of suppressing bacterial growth in this second phase. The host mechanism determining slow <b>net</b> growth <b>rate</b> is inherited as a dominant trait, and appears to be operating before the main cellular immune response. The influence of this mechanism on <b>net</b> growth <b>rate</b> is reflected in the time to death following a given dose of salmonellae.
