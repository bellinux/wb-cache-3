5|$|Upon {{returning}} from the 1994 Olympics, Kariya began contract negotiations with the Mighty Ducks in hopes of joining the team {{for the remainder of}} the 1993–94 NHL season. However, a deal failed to materialize and there was speculation in the media that he would instead play in Europe. It was reported that Kariya was seeking a US$12 million contract over five years from the Ducks. As both sides continued contract talks leading up to training camp for the 1994–95 season, Kariya agreed to a three-year, $6.5 million deal on August 31, 1994.

5|$|Churchill's and the British {{response}} was officially restrained. This {{was due to}} the strong-willed defence of the Belgian defensive campaign presented to the cabinet by Sir Roger Keyes at 11:30am 28 May.

5|$|In 2009, Jones {{brought a}} claim for damages for {{professional}} negligence against Kaney, {{on the basis that}} the personal injury claim had had to be settled for considerably less than would have been the case had Kaney <b>not</b> <b>signed</b> a document that apparently did not reflect her views. Kaney applied to strike out the claim before filing a defence, on the basis that the claim could not possibly succeed given the binding authority of the Court of Appeal decision of Stanton v Callaghan in 1998 that expert witnesses could not be sued for negligence when preparing a joint statement with the opposing side's expert witness.|$|E
