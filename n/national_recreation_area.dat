5|$|Eleven U.S. {{national}} parks – Arches, Black Canyon of the Gunnison, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Grand Canyon, Mesa Verde, Petrified Forest, Rocky Mountain, Saguaro, and Zion – {{are in the}} watershed, in addition to many national forests, state parks, and recreation areas. Hiking, backpacking, camping, skiing, and fishing are among the multiple recreation opportunities offered by these areas. Fisheries have declined in many streams in the watershed, especially in the Rocky Mountains, because of polluted runoff from mining and agricultural activities. The Colorado's major reservoirs are also heavily traveled summer destinations. Houseboating and water-skiing are popular activities on Lakes Mead, Powell, Havasu, and Mojave, as well as Flaming Gorge Reservoir in Utah and Wyoming, and Navajo Reservoir in New Mexico and Colorado. Lake Powell and surrounding Glen Canyon <b>National</b> <b>Recreation</b> <b>Area</b> received more than twomillion visitors per year in 2007, while nearly 7.9million people visited Lake Mead and the Lake Mead <b>National</b> <b>Recreation</b> <b>Area</b> in 2008.

5|$|In 1960, Democrat Frank Church, a U.S. Senator from Idaho, first {{introduced}} legislation for a feasibility study {{to survey the}} area for national park status. While Church allowed the 1960 feasibility study legislation to die, he introduced a bill in 1963 to create Sawtooth Wilderness National Park, which would primarily encompass the existing Sawtooth Primitive Area. Although the 1963 bill also was not voted on, Church admitted {{that it was not}} designed to pass but rather to encourage thorough feasibility studies by both the Forest Service and National Park Service. A 1965 joint report by the two agencies recommended either a national park administered by the National Park Service or a <b>national</b> <b>recreation</b> <b>area</b> managed by the Forest Service. In April 1966, Church introduced two bills, one to establish Sawtooth National Park and another to establish the Sawtooth <b>National</b> <b>Recreation</b> <b>Area</b> (SNRA). The SNRA bill was cosponsored by Republican Leonard B. Jordan, another Senator from Idaho, because it preserved the area while also permitting traditional uses such as logging, hunting, and grazing. The legislation was not supported by Idaho's members of the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E
5|$|Sawtooth National Forest is a National Forest {{that covers}} 2,110,408 acres (854,052 ha) in the U.S. states of Idaho (~96 percent) and Utah (~4 percent). Managed by the U.S. Forest Service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, it was {{originally}} named the Sawtooth Forest Reserve in a proclamation issued by President Theodore Roosevelt on May 29, 1905. On August 22, 1972 {{a portion of the}} forest was designated as the Sawtooth <b>National</b> <b>Recreation</b> <b>Area</b> (SNRA), which includes the Sawtooth, White Clouds, and Hemingway–Boulders wilderness areas. The forest is managed as four units: the SNRA and the Fairfield, Ketchum, and Minidoka Ranger Districts.|$|E
5|$|Lees Ferry is {{considered}} the official beginning of Grand Canyon National Park on the Colorado River and {{is used as a}} fishing area and river rafting launch site. The main access is by Lees Ferry Road, which splits off from U.S. Route 89 at the hamlet of Marble Canyon, Arizona, {{on the west side of}} the Navajo Bridges. The Lonely Dell Ranch Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and expanded to include Lees Ferry in 1997, features several buildings built during and after John D.

5|$|SR 3 {{begins at}} the {{junction}} with SR 36 south {{of the town of}} Peanut in Trinity County. SR 3 is also known as Bramlot Road from its southern terminus to Hayfork. This stretch of road through the Shasta-Trinity National Forest parallels the Hayfork River. Once SR 3 reaches the town of Hayfork, it travels along Hyampom Road east and snakes through the mountains to Douglas City and the junction with SR 299. From there, SR 3 runs concurrently with SR 299 north to the town of Weaverville. SR 3 then separates from SR 299, providing access to the Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity <b>National</b> <b>Recreation</b> <b>Area</b> and Trinity Dam along Lewiston Lake.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, a Route 94 freeway was {{proposed}} {{to run from}} I-80 in Netcong north to the planned Route 23 freeway in Hamburg, following US 206 north to Newton and current Route 94 to Hamburg. In the late 1960s, the NJDOT planned for the Route 94 freeway to run from I-80/US 46 in Columbia northeast to the New York border near Wawayanda State Park. The NJDOT hoped to get funding for the freeway in 1970 for it to become an Interstate highway as it was planned to serve a proposed <b>national</b> <b>recreation</b> <b>area</b> along the Delaware River {{that would have been}} built in conjunction with the controversial Tocks Island Dam project. This proposed Interstate, which was to run from I-80 in Hope Township to I-84 in Port Jervis and continue northeast along US 209, was denied funding. After reviewing the proposal again in 1972, the NJDOT determined that the freeway would cost $96 million. It was eventually canceled due to environmental concerns and financial constraints.|$|E
5|$|RE2 {{begins at}} the Rough Canyon boat-launch ramp on the Amistad Reservoir in the Rough Canyon Colonia region of the Amistad <b>National</b> <b>Recreation</b> <b>Area.</b> From this terminus, the highway {{proceeds}} as a two-lane, paved road, which travels through a small parking lot and turns northeastward. The road continues northeast as it passes the Rough Canyon Marina and the Rough Canyon Colonia camping area on {{the eastern edge of}} the park, as well as several houses and independent camp sites. The highway intersects Cam Real Road, which leads to the Devils Shores community and the surrounding area. The route bends eastward, passing the Rough Canyon Inn and a small parking lot and intersecting a small road before it continues into rural areas again. Proceeding along a small ridge, the highway bends northeastward and travels over a small unnamed wash before reaching its eastern terminus with US277/US377.|$|E

5|$|US 199 {{begins at}} a partial {{interchange}} with US 101 northeast of Crescent City; Elk Valley Cross Road (County Route D2) connects the two routes {{just to the}} north for full access. The highway quickly enters the Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, climbs over a ridge, crosses the Smith River, and meets State Route 197 (which heads northwest to US 101 via the Smith River). US 199 follows {{the banks of the}} river and its Middle Fork as it takes a steady but curvy climb through the Smith River <b>National</b> <b>Recreation</b> <b>Area</b> in the Six Rivers National Forest, passing the settlements of Hiouchi, Gasquet and Patrick Creek. As it approaches the summit, the Middle Fork Smith River turns east, but US 199 continues northeast, following Griffin Creek to near its source (where there is a rest area), and passing under Hazel View Summit, the border between the Smith River NRA and the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest, in the 1963 Collier Tunnel (elevation about 2100 feet/650 m). (The old curving route over the summit still exists as Oregon Mountain Road.) Upon leaving the tunnel, US 199 descends alongside the small Broken Kettle Creek into the Elk Valley and crosses into Oregon.|$|E

Also included is a section on planning theory and conceptual frameworks [...] the concept of Multiple-Use, and the theory of Transactive Planning, as developed by John Friedmann. Managers of thirty-six of thirty-seven existing <b>national</b> <b>recreation</b> <b>areas</b> were interviewed by telephone concerning area attributes, the designation process, public support, enabling legislation, impacts of designation, and management mechanisms.
