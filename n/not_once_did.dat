25|$|In 1956, District Attorney Ragan Madden of Lincoln and Union parishes filed {{to oppose}} Passman. <b>Not</b> <b>once</b> <b>did</b> a Republican {{candidate}} oppose Passman in his fifteen terms in office; the GOP {{at the time}} was a mostly moribund institution in Louisiana.|$|E
25|$|One of the Europeans, a Mr Tross, {{encouraged}} the young Baloo to bowl {{to him in}} the nets. His skill at slow left-arm bowling was enough to encourage other members to bat against him for practice, in particular the fine batsman Captain J.G.Greig. In time, he was bowling to them regularly, his bowling important practice for the club members. Despite bowling for hundreds of hours, Baloo later lamented that <b>not</b> <b>once</b> <b>did</b> any of the club members offer to allow him to bat—a role then considered the preserve of the aristocratic classes.(Guha 2002:90). An undocumented story states that he was paid 8 annas by JG Greig every time he dismissed him. Baloo thus perfected his bowling, spending hours in the nets bowling to the Europeans.|$|E
2500|$|Asked {{if he had}} any regrets, he said: [...] "If I {{had seen}} the banking crisis coming. Nobody advised me, no economist, all those people now writing books saying 'I told you so' – none of them." [...] On Anglo Irish Bank, he said: [...] "I can {{honestly}} say that <b>not</b> <b>once</b> <b>did</b> anyone or any delegation that came in to see me ever say, ‘Watch out for Anglo’ ... I wish they had have." [...] Referring to the [...] "great economic storm" [...] currently under way in Ireland, he warned against excessive pessimism: [...] "Some gains have been lost, but in truth many remain. I dearly wish there was no crisis. I realise {{that it would have been}} better if some things had been done differently, but I will not denigrate the good that has been done," [...] he added.|$|E
50|$|Carroll's febrile bowing is breathtaking, a {{model of}} rolls and {{triplets}} executed in fleet, articulate clusters. She sounds almost possessed, yet <b>not</b> <b>once</b> <b>does</b> she lose sight of those traditional reels' melodies {{in one of the}} more exhilarating Irish fiddle tracks ever recorded.|$|R
60|$|But {{to return}} to the {{moonlight}} on the grass. My thrust made home, there was a perceptible pause. <b>Not</b> at <b>once</b> <b>did</b> Fortini fall. <b>Not</b> at <b>once</b> <b>did</b> I withdraw the blade. For a full second we stood in pause--I, with legs spread, and arched and tense, body thrown forward, right arm horizontal and straight out; Fortini, his blade beyond me so far that hilt and hand just rested lightly against my left breast, his body rigid, his eyes open and shining.|$|R
5000|$|One {{hundred years}} after her birth in 1965, a group of activists erected a {{memorial}} in her honor in Okayama. The memorial includes a quotation from her autobiography:“My life has been one adversity upon another. But I always fought back. <b>Not</b> <b>once,</b> <b>not</b> even <b>once,</b> <b>did</b> I flinch from adversity.” ...|$|R
60|$|The {{director}} of the orchestra, a German, intense and enthusiastic, had worked {{hand in hand with}} Ethel to interpret to the highest degree her poetic ideas. The little man's delight was visibly manifest as the performance proceeded. <b>Not</b> <b>once</b> <b>did</b> the music halt, <b>not</b> <b>once</b> <b>did</b> the intelligent leader fail to intensify the climax of the stage.|$|E

60|$|Michael neither liked nor disliked him, but, rather, merely {{accepted}} him. They travelled the United States over together, {{and they}} never had a quarrel. <b>Not</b> <b>once</b> <b>did</b> Henderson raise his voice sharply to Michael, and <b>not</b> <b>once</b> <b>did</b> Michael snarl a warning at him. They simply endured together, existed together, because the currents of life had drifted them together. Of course, there was no heart-bond between them. Henderson was master. Michael was Henderson's chattel. Michael was as dead {{to him as he}} was himself dead to all things.|$|E
5000|$|On January 9, 2013, Gambino {{released}} his latest video from Camp, [...] "L.E.S." [...] The song's title is {{an acronym for}} the Lower East Side of the New York City borough of Manhattan, {{the location of the}} video shoot. Photographer Ibra Ake directed and filmed the video over [...] "several nights" [...] {{on the streets of the}} Lower East Side, in front of places like Pianos, and riding in cabs around the district; but <b>not</b> <b>once</b> <b>does</b> Gambino appear himself. While on tour in the summer of 2012, Gambino played this video in the background while he performed [...] "L.E.S." [...] onstage.|$|R
5000|$|The EP was {{generally}} praised by critics. Kevin Apaza from Direct Lyrics {{described it as}} [...] "five songs featuring hard-hitting synths, fierce and risqué lyrics, and a swagger by Brooke that can’t be duplicated. She’s making us excited about female rappers again. There {{just have to be}} more options than Nicki or Iggy!". Ashley Emma NG from Best Fan also praised the proyect saying [...] "Opulence brings a fresh sound that is all Brooke Candy. Some may not understand her lascivious and unconventional attitude, but you can’t help but respect her hustle. Her confidence is indestructible, and <b>not</b> <b>once</b> <b>does</b> it come off as cocky." ...|$|R
5000|$|The New World Translation {{also uses}} the name Jehovah 237 {{times in the}} New Testament where the extant texts use only the Greek words kurios (Lord) and theos (God). Walter Martin, an evangelical minister, wrote, [...] "It can be shown from {{literally}} thousands of copies of the Greek New Testament that <b>not</b> <b>once</b> <b>does</b> the tetragrammaton appear." [...] However, the translators of the New World Translation believed that the name Jehovah was present in the original manuscripts of the New Testament when quoting from the Old Testament, but replaced with the other terms by later copyists. Based on this reasoning, the translators [...] "restored the divine name", {{though it is not}} present in any extant manuscripts.|$|R
60|$|She {{would have}} called him back, {{but he had no}} idea of lending himself to {{anything}} so inartistic. With head thrown back, he left the footpath and climbed the hill round which they had been walking. <b>Not</b> <b>once</b> <b>did</b> he look behind. <b>Not</b> <b>once</b> <b>did</b> he turn his head till he stood {{on the top of the}} rock-strewn eminence, his figure clearly outlined against the blue sky. Then he straightened himself and turned round, thinking all the time how wonderfully effective his profile must seem in that deep, soft light, if she should have the sense to look.|$|E
60|$|Soon {{the ranch}} {{house and the}} corral were mere specks in the distance, and then even these faded from view. The pony kept to the open country, and <b>not</b> <b>once</b> <b>did</b> he slacken his speed.|$|E
60|$|Wolf's trot {{broke into}} a run. Wider and wider were the leaps he made. <b>Not</b> <b>once</b> <b>did</b> he turn his head, his wolf's brush {{standing}} out straight behind him. He cut sharply across {{the curve of the}} trail and was gone.|$|E
5000|$|O'Toole {{described}} Sloan's {{style as}} follows: [...] "Whereas Taylor occasionally backs off {{to justify his}} ardor for efficiency in human terms, <b>not</b> <b>once</b> <b>does</b> Sloan make reference to any other values. Freedom, equality, humanism, stability, community, tradition, religion, patriotism, family, love, virtue, nature—all are ignored. In the one personal element in the book, he makes passing reference to his wife: he abandons her {{on the first day}} of a European vacation to return to business in Detroit. His language is as calculating as that of the engineer-of-old working with calipers and slide rule, as cold as the steel he caused to be bent to form cars: economizing, utility, facts, objectivity, systems, rationality, maximizing—that is the stuff of his vocabulary." ...|$|R
5|$|Although As I Lay Dying {{has stated}} on {{numerous}} occasions {{that all of the}} members of the group are practicing Christians, the band is usually described by media as being in the metalcore genre, not Christian metal. This is largely because the band's lyrics do not directly focus on pro-Christian themes the way many praise music bands do nor do they treat their music as a direct extension of their private Christian worship or proselytizing efforts. For example, <b>not</b> <b>once</b> <b>do</b> the names God or Jesus appear in any As I Lay Dying song, nor do any of their songs explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or quote the Bible. Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like existential angst or the struggle between reason and spirituality.|$|R
60|$|Durade {{led her to}} a {{table that}} had been placed under some shelves which were {{littered}} with bottles and glasses. He gave her instructions {{what to do when}} called upon, saying that Stitt would help her; then motioning her to a chair, {{he went back to the}} men. It was difficult for her to raise her eyes, and she could <b>not</b> at <b>once</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|R

60|$|<b>Not</b> <b>once</b> <b>did</b> {{she look}} back. She was already remote {{when he began}} hurrying after her. Once he was in motion he quickened his pace and gained upon her. He was within thirty yards of her as she drew near the gates.|$|E
60|$|Ellen {{complied}} with this order and, riding {{up behind the}} three mounted men, she soon found herself leaving what for years had been her home. <b>Not</b> <b>once</b> <b>did</b> she look back. She hoped she would never see the squalid, bare pretension of a ranch again.|$|E
60|$|I {{think we}} all knew that upon {{the outcome of this}} battle would hinge for ever the {{relative}} positions of these two races upon Barsoom. It was a battle between the old and the new, but <b>not</b> for <b>once</b> <b>did</b> I question the outcome of it. With Carthoris at my side I fought for the red men of Barsoom and for their total emancipation from the throttling bondage of a hideous superstition.|$|R

Pray take her to Ventnor. How much shall I give you?' ...|$|R
500|$|Jamie Milton of DIY {{felt that}} the album needed [...] "another breakneck force shock to the system" [...] similar to [...] "Ful Stop", and that it {{contained}} some unnecessary elements, such as the [...] "over-tinkering echo" [...] of [...] "Present Tense" [...] and the [...] "jagged closing section" [...] of [...] "Decks Dark". Nonetheless, Milton concluded that [...] "every inch of this record has been meticulously crafted, tailor-made to fit the strengths of every member. <b>Not</b> <b>once</b> <b>does</b> a song sit out of place or come across as unfinished. These are gorgeous, human, complete works – {{some of the best}} of [...] remarkable career." [...] Alexis Petridis of the Guardian criticised the [...] "suffocating gloom of the lyrics", but felt the album was an improvement over The King of Limbs, writing that Radiohead had [...] " [...] something they've never achieved before ... Alone among their commercial peers, Radiohead are held to not just release albums but make grand artistic statements worth dissecting and poring over." ...|$|R
60|$|For a {{long time}} I sat and watched the coming and going of great numbers of the cave-folk. <b>Not</b> <b>once</b> <b>did</b> one leave the cliff by any other opening save that from which I had seen the first party come, nor did any reenter the cliff through another aperture.|$|E

6000|$|As they journeyed along, {{the wind}} swept mournfully through the pines and pecans, but <b>not</b> <b>once</b> <b>did</b> they {{catch sight of}} any wild animal, outside of a few {{squirrels}} and hares. Some of these Poke Stover brought down, [...] "jest to keep his hand in," [...] as he declared.|$|E
60|$|This is {{just what}} they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Once</b> out of the inlet, they went about and headed northward, up the coast, and we {{remained}} watching them until Mr. Trevor became a mere oscillating black speck against the sail.|$|R
50|$|These spiders {{are very}} hard to find when <b>not</b> moving. <b>Once</b> they <b>do</b> move, they do so {{exceedingly}} quick and jerky. The enlarged first pair of legs is not used in walking, but are extended in front. When males spot a female, they approach it with their front legs extended and waving, prior to mating.|$|R
2500|$|The play {{opened on}} 17 January 1904, the director's birthday, at the Moscow Art Theatre under the {{direction}} of the actor-director Konstantin Stanislavski. During rehearsals, the structure of Act Two was re-written. Famously contrary to Chekhov's wishes, Stanislavski's version was, by and large, a tragedy. Chekhov disliked the Stanislavski production intensely, concluding that Stanislavski had [...] "ruined" [...] his play. In one of many letters on the subject, Chekhov would complain, [...] "Anya, I fear, should not have any sort of tearful tone... <b>Not</b> <b>once</b> <b>does</b> my Anya cry, nowhere do I speak of a tearful tone, in the second act there are tears in their eyes, but the tone is happy, lively. Why did you speak in your telegram about so many tears in my play? Where are they? ... Often you will find the words [...] "through tears," [...] but I am describing only the expression on their faces, not tears. And in the second act there is no graveyard." [...] The playwright's wife Olga Knipper played Madame Ranevskaya in the original Moscow Art Theatre production, as well as in the 300th production of the play by the theatre in 1943.|$|R
60|$|No sooner was Striped Chipmunk out {{of sight}} than up jumped Peter Rabbit. He smiled {{to himself as he}} hurried over to the shining mound of yellow gravel. You see Peter's curiosity was so great that <b>not</b> <b>once</b> <b>did</b> he think how mean he was to spy on Striped Chipmunk.|$|E
60|$|Jonathan gave an assenting grunt, {{and they}} turned their faces towards the lake, still walking at the same leisurely pace. <b>Not</b> <b>once</b> <b>did</b> {{any of the three}} look back. As they neared the water, James found the temptation very strong to do so, but he {{restrained}} it, and sauntered along as carelessly as ever.|$|E
60|$|They {{fell upon}} D'Arnot tooth and nail, beating him with sticks and stones and tearing {{at him with}} claw-like hands.

He breathed a silent prayer that he be quickly delivered from his torture.|$|E
50|$|And {{as fast as}} {{they got}} through the Serbian League East, next season proved to be even better. 2011-12 Serbian First League got conquered, even with three {{coaching}} changes, the last one happened to be Aleksandar Ilić again, and even though the financial troubles started to mount within the club, <b>not</b> for <b>once</b> <b>did</b> the FK Radnički Niš players let someone take over the first spot. Pejčić put in another great season, this time appearing 20 times and scoring three goals.After nine long seasons, southern Serbian giant has come back, and Pejčić's loyalty did not get forgotten.|$|R
40|$|The petitioners in last year’s {{historic}} {{same-sex marriage}} case cited {{most of the}} Supreme Court’s canonical substantive due process precedents. They argued that the right of same-sex couples to marry, like {{the right to use}} birth control and the right to guide the upbringing of one’s children, was among the liberties protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court in Obergefell v. Hodges agreed, citing many of the same cases. <b>Not</b> <b>once,</b> however, <b>did</b> the petitioners or the majority in Obergefell cite the Court’s most famous substantive due process decision.
