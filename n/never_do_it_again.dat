Later, Scully is packing her things in the hospital when Doggett comes in to inform her about {{the trial of the}} cult members; they are offering little defense except that they claim that they are being persecuted for their religious beliefs. Scully muses that they thought the worm was the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. She apologizes to Doggett for going out on the mission alone and promises to <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
25|$|On April 19, 2009 at Lockdown, he {{defeated}} Sting {{to win the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship for {{his first}} ever championship in TNA, and his fourth World title overall. Mick did not lose the championship, but Sting became the new leader of the Main Event Mafia by pinning Kurt Angle at Sacrifice. Foley had also stated on Impact! tapings that if he retained the TNA World Heavyweight Title at the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary, he would only put the title up in a match once a year. However, he lost the title to Kurt Angle in the King of The Mountain match at Slammiversary. He received a rematch at Victory Road, commenting he had only submitted once in his career (to Terry Funk, in a spinning toe hold) and swore he'd <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> He lost the match when Angle forced him to submit again with the ankle lock.|$|E

"Yes, indeed, I <b>did</b> once--but I <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> I caught one, a kitten, and set {{off with}} a number of boys to kill it; but as we went along it began to play with my neck-tie and to purr! Our hearts were softened, so we let it go. Ah! Corrie, my boy, never go hunting cats," [...] said Montague, earnestly.|$|R

They <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> She let her legs go limp like a spoiled child, {{and sat down on}} the trail. They went on their way, but she did not move. After they had travelled three miles they unloaded the sled, came back for her, and by main strength put her on the sled again.|$|R

2500|$|Whenever a {{rebellion}} {{broke out in}} the Assyrian empire, the Assyrian kings inevitably brutally crushed it (as an alternative to deportation) and enforced great punishments on the rebellious vassals. Ashurnasirpal II assured that the rebellions whom he encountered would be crushed with the same cruelty so that his opponents would <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> In one of his expeditions, Ashurnasirpal II described how he faced the rebels, in which they were being flayed, impaled, decapitated, or burned alive: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, DeVille {{recorded}} Backstreets of Desire, {{the first}} of four albums he would record in Los Angeles with producer John Philip Shenale. [...] "I say it every time I record in L.A. — that I'll <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> and I keep doing it... It's crazy. I just record and go to the hotel, and never go out, then back to the studio. I hate L.A. It's the worst. I think they eat their children there. I never saw any kids. It's a pity there aren't more studios in New Orleans." [...] Although DeVille complained about having to record in Los Angeles, recording in that city put him in touch with many talented Latino musicians who helped shape his distinctive Spanish-Americana sound.|$|E
2500|$|Baron, who {{describes}} bottling as a [...] "traumatic time for wine", has said, [...] "To me, wine {{has always been}} more than something to drink. My family’s love and appreciation of good food, the time I’ve spent in France and the many mentors I've had along the way have led me to {{an appreciation of the}} role wine plays in daily life as well as history and culture. To me, creating wine is one of the ways people preserve civilization." [...] Baron has also said, [...] "Even after years of experience, every vintage feels like a childbirth-if we remembered how much it hurt, we might <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> And wines are much like our children. Their personality is there from day one, and we can track it through, know its essence even if its behavior at any particular moment is off. You get a feel from all of this of where the fruit has been and where it’s going. You have to remember this when you think about judging wines. They're alive and changing moment to moment; they have good days and bad; they show well in a particular glass or with particular food. Judging a wine at any particular moment in its life is like giving a kid a letter grade based on his behavior in the supermarket." ...|$|E

50|$|Winning the Pulitzer {{has meant}} {{nothing for the}} piece that won. Back when Blomstedt was at the San Francisco Symphony, David Zinman {{conducted}} <b>it</b> and <b>did</b> a beautiful job. But they <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> and nobody else has ever played it. It’s a very difficult piece. I write chromatic music and chromatic music is not in vogue at the moment. I think that has not helped things.The Prize has benefited me in other ways, however. You {{get a lot of}} notoriety out of it. My commissions have soared and everything I have written since that time has been published. And I am fortunate enough to have some of the best musicians in the world playing my chamber music, which has led to a CD that has just come out.|$|R

Bob really worked at it, and he took every piece of advice offered. Following the recording of one of his early shows, he turned from all the people telling him how good it had been and went to one of the cameraman.

60|$|Mary Vance, whom Mrs. Elliott {{had sent}} {{up to the}} manse on an errand, came {{tripping}} down Rainbow Valley {{on her way to}} Ingleside where she was to spend the afternoon with Nan and Di as a Saturday treat. Nan and Di had been picking spruce gum with Faith and Una in the manse woods and the four of them were now sitting on a fallen pine by the brook, all, it must be admitted, chewing rather vigorously. The Ingleside twins were not allowed to chew spruce gum anywhere but in the seclusion of Rainbow Valley, but Faith and Una were unrestricted by such rules of etiquette and cheerfully chewed it everywhere, at home and abroad, to the very proper horror of the Glen. Faith had been chewing it in church one day; but Jerry had realized the enormity of THAT, and had given her such an older-brotherly scolding that she <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R

60|$|I {{hope it will}} be {{set down}} to the right side of my account, but I had no sooner read these words, so touchingly silly, than my anger against Pinkerton was {{swallowed}} up in gratitude. Of all the circumstances of my career--my birth, perhaps, excepted--not one had given my poor father so profound a pleasure as this article in the Sunday Herald. What a fool, then, was I to be lamenting! when I had at last, and for once, and at the cost of only a few blushes, paid back a fraction of my debt of gratitude. So that, when I next met Pinkerton, I took things very lightly; my father was pleased, and thought the letter very clever, I told him; for my own part, I had no taste for publicity; thought the public had no concern with the artist, only with his art; and though I owned he had handled it with great consideration, I should take it as a favour if he <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
5000|$|During Gary's childhood, {{the family}} {{frequently}} relocated throughout the Western United States, with Frank supporting them by selling fake magazine subscriptions. Gary had a troubled {{relationship with his}} father, whom his youngest brother Mikal described as a [...] "cruel and unreasonable man." [...] Frank Gilmore, Sr. was strict and quick to anger, and would often whip his sons Frank, Jr., Gary and Gaylen with a razor strop, whip or a belt for little or no reason. Less often, he would beat his wife. He mellowed somewhat with age: Mikal reported that Frank whipped him only once, and <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> after Mikal told him, [...] "I hate you." [...] In addition, Frank and Bessie would argue loudly and verbally abuse each other. Frank would anger Bessie by calling her crazy, and defame Brigham Young, the second president and prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as [...] "Bring 'em Young." [...] Bessie would retaliate by calling him a [...] "Cat-licker" [...] Catholic and threatening to kill him some night. This abuse continued for years, and caused considerable turmoil within the Gilmore family.|$|R
