40|$|Nickel (Ni) and {{molybdenum}} (Mo) are two metals {{that are}} {{commonly associated with}} northern Saskatchewan uranium deposits. Consequently, concentrations of Ni and Mo are elevated above background levels in uranium-mine effluent receiving waters. The objectives of this research were: (1) to determine if standard toxicity-test fish species, like <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> or rainbow trout, were predictive of toxicity to fish species that inhabit lakes near northern Canadian uranium mining operations, like northern pike or white suckers; (2) to determine if toxicity results derived in the laboratory related to toxicity observed in the field; (3) to determine the relative toxicity of Ni and Mo; (4) to determine how water quality parameters, such as hardness, pH, and total suspended solids (TSS) affects Ni toxicity; and, (5) to determine if exposure to Ni or Mo induced metallothionein in fish. Field studies indicated that Mo concentrations in receiving waters were strongly associated with larval <b>fathead</b> <b>minnow</b> mortality. However, laboratory tests provided contradictory results. Laboratory toxicity tests on field-collected receiving waters gave different results than field tests. Laboratory results were interpreted by considering confounding variables, such as hardness and pH. Waters generally high in Ni, circumneutral or slightly acidic, and with low hardness, caused <b>fathead</b> <b>minnow</b> eggs to hatch earlier than controls. This is a significant result because time-to-hatch is an ecologically important endpoint often not considered in more conventional toxicity-characterization programmes. In laboratory tests involving Ni- and Mo-spiked laboratory dilution water, Ni was much more toxic than Mo. The most sensitive endpoint for Ni toxicity was time required for <b>fathead</b> <b>minnow</b> eggs to hatch. Tolerance to Ni varied by species in the following order: juvenile rainbow trout > alevin rainbow trout > white suckers > <b>northern</b> pike > <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows.</b> Waterborne Mo was not toxic to any life stage of any fish species tested. Indirect evidence suggested that dietary Mo may be toxic to fish, although further work is required. Water hardness, pH, and TSS reduced Ni toxicity to larval <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows.</b> Metallothionein was induced in juvenile rainbow trout gills, but not livers, in Ni-exposed fish, but not Mo-exposed fish...|$|R
50|$|Ostariophysan fishes, {{which include}} <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows,</b> possess an alarm substance, or Schreckstoff, in {{distinctive}} epidermal club cells. The alarm substance is released upon mechanical damage to these club cells {{due to a}} predator attack, and can be detected by other ostariophysan fishes which then engage in antipredator behaviors such as hiding or dashing away. <b>Fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> learn to recognize an animal as a potential predator when it is presented {{in conjunction with the}} alarm substance. Also, alarm substance ingested by the predator will chemically label it as dangerous to naïve <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows,</b> thereby resulting in learned predator recognition. Prey fishes with chemical predator recognition abilities can inhabit areas with low visibility and more quickly detect ambush predators like the <b>fathead</b> <b>minnow’s</b> primary predator, the northern pike.|$|R

40|$|West Nile virus (WNv) {{has become}} a {{significant}} and increasing threat to wildlife populations and human health throughout North America. Mosquito control is an important and potentially effective means of controlling the spread of WNv, as the virus is primarily spread between avian and mosquito vectors. This is of particular concern for avian host species such as the Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), where WNv has been documented to negatively affect sage-grouse survival {{to the point of}} possible local extirpation. The most common mosquito control methods focus on controlling mosquitoes at their larval life stages. Efforts have primarily been limited to larvacide pucks or sprays, which require repeated application and could have potentially negative ecological consequences. Here, my primary objective is to test the efficacy of using <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> (Pimephales promelas) as a biological control for mosquito populations in northeastern Wyoming. Specifically, I address two main questions: 1) does the presence of <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> influence mosquito larva density within reservoirs, and 2) what pond and water quality characteristics support viable populations of <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows?</b> In the summers of 2013, 2014, I introduced minnows into 9 of 16 monitored reservoirs. The presence of <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows,</b> mosquito larva density, and adult mosquito populations were monitored at all sites on a weekly basis during 2013. During the 2014 and 2015 seasons, tissue samples were collected for stable isotope analysis, and <b>fathead</b> <b>minnow</b> population density was measured and recorded {{at the beginning and end}} of each season. Results indicate that minnows are a promising alternative to controlling mosquito larvae density within these reservoir environments. The presence of <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> lowered and suppressed temporal variation in mosquito population densities throughout the summer seasons. Additionally, self-sustaining minnow populations established at the majority of sites. Water quality parameters measured did not influence survivability at the ranges detected in these reservoir environments.

40|$|<b>Fathead</b> <b>minnow</b> (Pimephales promelas) {{lifecycle}} {{tests have}} been used to assess the effects of many North American pulp mill effluents. Fish are exposed under controlled laboratory conditions to final effluent, from the egg stage through hatching, juvenile stage and mature adult stage. Outlined here are methods for the lifecycle test (which takes from 4 to 5 months to complete) with sampling of juvenile fish at 1, 2 and 3 months of age, and sampling of mature adults after breeding. The results of most <b>fathead</b> <b>minnow</b> lifecycle studies have shown that pulp mill effluents cause metabolic and reproductive dis-ruption (enlarged livers, reduced egg production, smaller gonads, decreased sex hormones and reduced secondary sex charac-teristics). Thus, the <b>fathead</b> <b>minnow</b> lifecycle assay is able to mimic the most commonly observed changes seen in wild fish exposed to pulp mill effluents. Sensitive indicators of reproductive effects in <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> exposed for a lifecycle to pulp mill effluents include secondary sex characteristics, time to first reproduction and number of eggs laid. Egg production is often the most sensitive response to pulp mill effluents. Because of the length and cost of full lifecycle tests, a shortened assay using adult fish was developed as a screen for endocrine-disrupting compounds. This assay, the terminal reproduction test, has been used with success on a few pulp mill effluents. The assay exposes <b>fathead</b> <b>minnow</b> breeding pairs for three weeks to effluent, and compares egg production, sex characteristics and bioindicators of reproductive performance in pre-exposure versus post-exposure fish.

40|$|Fishes in the {{superorder}} Ostariophysi, including <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> (Pimephales promelas), possess specialized epidermal club {{cells that}} contain an alarm substance. Damage to these cells, as would occur during a predator attack, causes {{the release of}} the alarm substance and can indicate the presence of actively foraging predators to nearby conspecifics. For nearly 70 years, research involving epidermal club cells has focused on the alarm substance and the role it plays in predator/prey interactions. However, recent studies have indicated {{that there may be a}} connection between epidermal club cells and the fish immune system. Fish increase investment in epidermal club cells upon exposure to skin penetrating pathogens and parasites. In this study I tested for differences in epidermal club cell investment by <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> exposed to the immunosuppressive effects of the glucocorticoid hormone cortisol. In experiment 1, <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> were exposed to either a single intraperitoneal injection of corn oil or no injection at all. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether corn oil, the vehicle for cortisol injections in later experiments, had an effect on epidermal club cell density. The treatments had no effect on epidermal club cell size, cell area, or epidermal thickness. In experiment 2, skin extract was prepared from the skin of corn oil injected and non injected <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> as in experiment 1 to determine whether corn oil had an effect on the epidermal club cell alarm substance concentration. The treatments showed no significant differences in observed anti-predator behaviour, including change in shelter use, dashing and freezing. In experiment 3, <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> were exposed to either a single intraperitoneal injection of cortisol or corn oil. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether cortisol, a known immunosuppressant, had an effect on epidermal club cell investment. <b>Fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> exposed to a single cortisol injection had significantly reduced respiratory burst activity of kidney phagocytes indicating that there was suppression of the innate immune system. Furthermore, cortisol treated <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> showed significantly lower numbers of epidermal club cells. The treatments had no effect on individual epidermal club cell area, epidermal thickness and serum cortisol levels after 12 days. The results from this experiment suggest that pharmacological cortisol injections in <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> have a suppressive effect on the fish innate immune system. Furthermore, the findings that cortisol induced immunosuppression also influences epidermal club cell investment provides support for the hypothesis that epidermal club cells may function as part of the fish immune system...|$|R

With females, egg production and hatchability are reduced. The effects take place more quickly in females than in males, though. The effect of low pH on the <b>fathead</b> <b>minnow</b> has also been studied. Though survival was minimally affected by extended exposure to low pH, the minnow behavior was abnormal. They showed stress behaviors, such as surface swimming and hyperactivity. In addition, some deformities also were brought about by long exposure to low pH. In both males and females, their heads became smaller than normal. Males lose some of the brightness of their color. Females become heavy with eggs but may not spawn, and the number of eggs per female is reduced. The eggs themselves come out abnormal, fragile and lacking turgidity, and the lower the pH, the less likely the eggs are to eventually hatch.

Small-bodied fishes in the Grand Canyon consumed a variety of resources, including diatoms, amorphous detritus, terrestrial vegetation, aquatic invertebrates, and terrestrial invertebrates. Diet composition depended on season, and was especially affected by turbidity during flood events. Generally, small-bodied fishes consumed more allochthonous carbon (e. g. amorphous detritus and terrestrial vegetation) during the monsoon season when tributaries were flooding and mainstem turbidity was high. Regardless of seasonal variability in diet, the juveniles of native suckers exhibited extensive diet overlap with non-native <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows,</b> but speckled dace diets did not overlap with <b>fathead</b> <b>minnow</b> diets.

The <b>fathead</b> <b>minnow</b> (Pimephales promelas) is an OECD-proposed test species routinely used in reproductive toxicity trials with suspected endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs). The basic fecundity, endocrinology, and histopathology of reproductively active male and female <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> has been well characterized, but there are few studies of the utility of male sperm concentration and motility as endpoints for use in reproductive trials. The {{purpose of this study was}} to (1) characterize the baseline sperm concentration and motility of pair-breeding male <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> over their spawning cycle and (2) determine whether a repeated and nondestructive sperm sampling protocol would influence the baseline fecundity of the fish. Pair-breeding male <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> that underwent sampling for milt three times a week for 4 weeks exhibited no significant changes in milt volume, sperm concentration, or motility parameters up to 6 days after each spawning event. The repeated sperm sampling procedure did, however, cause a significant lowering of spawning frequencies, although this decline did not correlate with effects on fecundity as there were no significant changes in the mean total numbers of eggs laid, fertilization, and hatching successes. This study confirmed the presence of a stable background of sperm concentration and motility parameters of pair-breeding male <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> under reference conditions. The absence of any inherent “cycling” in the magnitude of these parameters over the spawning period suggests that sperm concentration and motility could be useful measures of male reproductive toxicity at the termination of tests in which pair-breeding males are at varying days post spawn.

This study used mammalian pharmacodynamics to predict the mode of action of the 13 -blocker, propranolol, on fish, {{in order to identify}} chronic effects in <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows.</b> β-blockers target β 1 - and β 2 -adrenergic receptors in humans and hence these receptors were characterised in the <b>fathead</b> <b>minnow.</b> It was found that fish possess β 1 - and β 2 -ARs that are structurally very similar to their mammalian counterparts. Further, the distributions of these two β-ARs in various organs of the <b>fathead</b> <b>minnow</b> were similar to those in mammals. Pair-breeding assays were conducted, in which <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> were exposed to various concentrations of propranolol. To discover whether β-ARs had been up or down regulated by propranolol, molecular analysis was conducted on different tissues of the exposed fish using real-time polymerase-chain reactions (RT-PCR). Exposure of <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> to propranolol caused acute toxicity at 10 mg/L. Propranolol caused a statistically significant decrease in reproduction at 1. 0 mg/L, dose-related decreases in male weight, condition index and fatpad weight, and a dose-related increase in female GSI. Molecular analysis of βl- and β 2 -AR expression levels revealed a dose-related decrease in β 2 -AR expression in fathead liver and heart.

A number of metal mine effluents (MMEs) {{have been found to}} contribute to adverse effects in fish and benthic invertebrates, such as decreased diversity and density, however the specific causal factors of toxic responses during chronic exposures to the MMEs are often unknown. Therefore, the overall objective of this dissertation was to explore causative and modifying factors of MME toxicity to a resident fish species, the <b>fathead</b> <b>minnow</b> (Pimephales promelas), during chronic, multi-trophic exposures. The representative MME used in this study was the process water effluent (PWE) of a Canadian metal mine, which is released into Junction Creek in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. Chronic exposure to the MME {{has been a source of}} decreased reproductive output in <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> in several previous studies, however, these same studies were not able to determine the potential causal factors of the reproductive impairment. In order to address the overall objective, several laboratory mesocosm studies were conducted, which consisted of three separate components. The first component included exploring several metals (Cu, Ni, and Se; alone and in mixture) that are consistently present in the MME and are known to cause toxicity at fairly low concentrations as potential causes for decreased egg production in <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows.</b> The second component included evaluating the role of decreased food availability (a possible indirect effect of MME in the receiving environment) as a potential cause of decreased egg production in <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows.</b> The third and final component included examining the role of water chemistry [(increased alkalinity and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ] as potential modifying factors of chronic MME toxicity to <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows.</b> In general, my results suggest that the metals present in the MME likely do not contribute directly to decreased reproductive performance in <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> during chronic exposures, under the conditions examined. Instead, the MME appears to decrease food availability, therefore indirectly influence <b>fathead</b> <b>minnow</b> egg production. Furthermore, water chemistry modifications tested in this thesis were not able to entirely mitigate the reproductive effects in fish induced by the MME, although they did improve egg production relative to unmodified MME. Metal concentrations in fish tissues were not influenced by increases to alkalinity or DOC level in the exposure water, suggesting that bioavailability of metals during chronic exposure to metal-mixtures cannot be fully explained based on our understanding of metal complexation with abiotic ligands (inorganic and organic) during single metal or acute exposures. From a regulatory perspective, water chemistry modifications may somewhat improve <b>fathead</b> <b>minnow</b> reproductive performance during chronic exposure to the MME, however the MME would still not be entirely free of effects relative to the uncontaminated water. Future studies should focus on understanding the factors responsible for decreased food availability in MME-impacted aquatic ecosystems, and further explore potential approaches for ameliorating effluent quality...|$|R
