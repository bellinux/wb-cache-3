500|$|After the Battle of Lincoln in 1141, with Stephen {{in captivity}} in Bristol, Theobald did not {{immediately}} join the Empress. [...] He claimed that he <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Stephen before switching his oath of fealty. After consulting in person with Stephen, he secured permission to accept the current conditions, and then joined Henry of Blois, who had switched sides, at Winchester in April for a legatine council held to depose Stephen and crown Matilda as queen. Attendance at the council was sparse however, and the Empress could not be crowned {{because she did not}} hold London. After the unsuccessful attempt to crown Matilda, those gathered at Winchester had to flee before Stephen's forces; one of Matilda's chief supporters, her half-brother Robert of Gloucester, was captured. During their flight Theobald and his fellow bishops were robbed of their horses and ecclesiastical vestments. Theobald then took a leading part in the negotiations that led to the exchange of Robert for Stephen, which happened in November 1141. Henry of Blois, having switched sides again, then held another legatine council in Westminster, which reaffirmed Stephen as king. Theobald ceremonially crowned Stephen at Canterbury during the Christmas court held there.|$|E
500|$|Marc-Antoine Audette {{said that}} it took the duo {{about four or five}} days of calls to Palin's staff to finally {{be able to talk to}} her. They claimed that they started by talking to {{low-level}} people in Alaska and made their way up through Palin's campaign staff. Audette said that at first they didn't think their prank would work, calling it a [...] "mission impossible". He claimed that [...] "after about a dozen calls", the duo [...] "started to realize it [...] might work, because her [...] staff didn't know the name of the French President. They asked us to spell it." [...] Audette and Trudel credited their ability to make their way up through Palin's staff to sounding convincing during the first few calls, always arranging to place the call at a set time, and not leaving a contact number. The four days of calls <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Palin was quicker compared to some of their other pranks. Audette and Trudel {{said that it}} took them two months to talk to Paul McCartney and one to talk to Bill Gates, but only two days to prank Britney Spears.|$|E

500|$|Since its broadcast, [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{garnered}} {{little to}} no scrutiny from viewers. Vitti has never gotten any questions about the episode, except from his sister-in-law who wanted him to explain the episode for his nephews. [...] " [...] My sister-in-law called me up saying that I <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> my nephews about how this was wrong that Homer did", Vitti said. [...] "They watched it and had lots of questions for her. And she referred them all to me. So {{there are some people}} who are still bothered by it." [...] The little amount of scrutiny that the episode attracted took The Simpsons staff by surprise, as they anticipated that the episode would generate a lot of controversy. Instead, [...] "Blame It on Lisa", an episode which aired the previous week, caused an uproar in Brazil because of its depiction of the country. It became one of the biggest controversies the series has ever faced. [...] "It just goes to show that you never know what's going to be a problem", Jean said in the DVD commentary for [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's".|$|E

[...] Hearst had never previously accepted roles where {{she was asked to}} play herself, stating that it was a [...] "pathetic attempt to get attention" [...] when other celebrities played themselves or characters similar to themselves. Hearst had heard of Veronica Mars and seen several episodes prior to her appearance; nevertheless, she still <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Thomas about the series and her character before agreeing to guest star, commenting that she discovered that the character's background was not exceedingly similar to her own life, as [...] "Selma's situation is nothing like anything I've had to deal with." [...] When reading the script for the first time, Hearst was amused by the fact that her character was the heiress to the [...] "Hearst Mart fortune", comparing it to Walmart; she stated, [...] "when I read that in the script, I burst out laughing. It was a spit-take kind of thing. I almost fell over." [...] When asked whether or not the character would become a recurring one, she responded that the idea had not come up in discussions with the crew. However, she stated that she would accept if given the opportunity, and she particularly enjoyed working with Kristen Bell, Enrico Colantoni, and Ed Begley, Jr..|$|E

But I think more than anything, he was a visionary.|$|E

50|$|Lynne's {{gift for}} dancing was {{discovered}} by a doctor. She had been underperforming at school, so her mother {{took her to the}} doctor and explained about her fidgeting and lack of focus.

50|$|BNU {{was mainly}} used with DOS-based Bulletin Board System (BBS) {{software}} {{written in the}} late 1980s to mid-1990s. It is not used by Windows-based BBS software, but BNU can be used under Windows NTVDM to run DOS-based BBS software under Windows. BNU and other similar drivers were not limited solely to {{being used in the}} BBS world. The enhanced capabilities they offered were also used to easily communicate with other serially connected devices for the same reasons that the FOSSIL specification and FOSSIL drivers were originally created. That reason, as noted above, was to separate the details of serial port communications from the actual application. The software's programmers only <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the serial driver in a standardized way to send and receive their data.|$|E

In the first episode the office is green with various pictures and certificates adorning the wall; after this, however, the office is antique white with tribal masks featured, presumably from Albright's anthropological studies (later it is found that she simply [...] "bought them at airports"). [...] Dick often uses his class, oddly enough the same throughout all six seasons, {{to gain a better understanding}} of humanity by assigning arbitrary essays on which their grade depends. Dick never has the idea that they're actually learning something, but when he finally gets through to them [...] "his father" [...] came in, dismissing the class because he <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Dick.|$|E

5000|$|Majority of {{the filming}} {{was done in}} secrecy and without any news coverage, {{allowing}} no journalists to visit or report from filming locations. Further, Majidi talked less to his actors face to face, and mostly they <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> his assistants. In an interview with Mumbai Mirror, Majidi stated that for filming {{on a grand scale}} he faced many problems of administration and logistics. As 40 per cent of the story takes place in Mecca in the 6th century, Majidi and his team recreated the city to what it would have been 1400 years ago. Filming was done at a set constructed near the city Qom, Iran. Later, the location of the set was named as [...] "Prophet Muhammad Cinematic City" [...] due to its grandiosity in structure and area. Certain scenes requiring elephants were filmed at Bela-Bela in South Africa. [...] Despite having meagre sources, no paintings from that period to help us in the process, the team tried to make the location as historically accurate as possible. Besides this, in other locations they had problems with constructions, with providing costumes and animals, transporting elephants and handling the huge number of people on the shoot, as some days the team had nearly 3000 extras present on the site.|$|E
