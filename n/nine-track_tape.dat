5000|$|Magnetic {{tape was}} {{available}} {{in a variety of}} models, all using open-reel Â½ inch magnetic tape. Various models could read and write seven-track or <b>nine-track</b> <b>tape</b> with densities from 200 bits per inch (bpi) to 1600 bpi at rates of 37.5 inches per second (ips) to 150 ips. The maximum transfer rate was 266 characters per second (cps). All models connected to the system through the IOM.|$|E
40|$|A <b>nine-track</b> <b>tape</b> drive {{interfaced}} to {{a standard}} personal computer was used to transport data from a remote test site to the NASA Lewis mainframe computer for analysis. The Cyclic Ground Test of the Ion Auxiliary Propulsion System (IAPS), which successfully achieved its goal of 2557 cycles and 7057 hr of thrusting beam on time generated several megabytes of test data over many months of continuous testing. A flight-like controller and power supply were used to control the thruster and acquire data. Thruster data was converted to RS 232 format and transmitted to a personal computer, which stored the raw digital data on the <b>nine-track</b> <b>tape.</b> The tape format was such that with minor modifications, mainframe flight data analysis software {{could be used to}} analyze the Cyclic Ground Test data. The personal computer also converted the digital data to engineering units and displayed real time thruster parameters. Hardcopy data was printed at a rate dependent on thruster operating conditions. The tape drive provided a convenient means to transport the data to the mainframe for analysis, and avoided a development effort for new data analysis software for the Cyclic test. This paper describes the data system, interfacing and software requirements...|$|E
50|$|At {{least partly}} due {{to the success of the}} S/360, and the {{resultant}} standardization on 8-bit character codes and byte addressing, <b>nine-track</b> <b>tapes</b> were very widely used throughout the computer industry during the 1970s and 1980s.|$|R
50|$|<b>Nine-track</b> {{cassette}} <b>tape</b> {{given to}} fan club members.|$|R
50|$|Early {{half-inch}} tape {{had seven}} parallel tracks of data {{along the length}} of the tape allowing, six-bit characters plus one bit of parity written across the tape. This was known as seven-track tape. With the introduction of the IBM System 360 mainframe, <b>nine-track</b> <b>tapes</b> were introduced to support the new 8-bit characters that it used. Effective recording density increased over time. Common seven-track densities started at 200, then 556, and finally 800 cpi and <b>nine-track</b> <b>tapes</b> had densities of 800 (using NRZI), 1600 (using PE), and 6250 cpi (using GCR). This translates into about 5 MB to 140 MB per standard length (2400ft) reel of tape. End of file was designated by a tape mark and end of tape by two tape marks. The physical beginning and end of usable tape was indicated by reflective adhesive strips of aluminum foil.|$|R
50|$|In the ANSI X3.27-1969 {{magnetic}} tape standard, {{the end of}} file was indicated by a tape mark, which consisted of a gap of approximately 3.5 inches of tape followed by a single byte containing the character 13 (hex) for <b>nine-track</b> <b>tapes</b> and 17 (octal) for seven-track tapes. The end-of-tape, commonly abbreviated as EOT, was indicated by two tape marks. This was the standard used, for example, on IBM 360. The reflective strip {{that was used to}} announce impending physical end of tape was also called an EOT marker.|$|R
5000|$|... 9-track 800 NRZI and 1600 PE (phase encoding) tapes use a 0.6 in {{inter-record gap}} (IRG) between data records {{to allow the}} tape to stop and start between records. 6250 GCR tapes use a tighter 0.3 in IRG. The 9-track tapes had {{reflective}} stickers placed 10 ft {{from the beginning of}} tape (BOT) and 14 ft from the end of tape (EOT) to signal the hardware. <b>Nine-track</b> <b>tapes</b> commonly had densities of 800, 1600, and 6250 cpi, giving 22.5MB, 45MB and 175MB respectively on a standard 2400 ft tape. Signaling EOT (end of tape) with space remaining to write trailer blocks allowed support for multivolume labelled tapes.|$|R
50|$|Each DASD/Tape Controller {{had eight}} device {{addresses}} {{and provided a}} data transfer rate of 3 MB. IBM 9332 (368 MB) and IBM 9335 (824 MB) DASD and IBM 9347 <b>nine-track</b> half-inch <b>tape</b> have been announced for the 9370s.|$|R
25|$|The {{inclusion}} of these components {{did not make}} the system large the original V7 UNIX distribution, consisting of copies of all of the compiled binaries plus all of the source code and documentation occupied less than 10MB and arrived on a single <b>nine-track</b> magnetic <b>tape.</b> The printed documentation, typeset from the on-line sources, was contained in two volumes.|$|R
40|$|The {{acquisition}} of terrain data from aerial photography using digital photogrammetric methods gives the engineer and planner an economical alternative to conventional ground surveys. This paper describes a complete photogrammetric digitizing system {{developed for the}} Portland District Army Corps of Engineers. The hardware of the system consists of a Wild AlO first order stereoplotter interfaced to an Altec AC- 74 coordinate digitizer which is interfaced to both a Hewlett Packard 9810 A programmable calculator and a Digi-Data <b>nine-track</b> magnetic <b>tape</b> recorder. The software of the system consists of photogrammetric routines developed for online computation by the programmable calculator and a sophisticated FORTRAN IV program called PHOTDIG which processes the digitized photogrammetric data from the <b>nine-track</b> magnetic <b>tape</b> at the Corps of Engineers data processing facility which contains an IBM 370 computer and a Calcomp 748 precision flatbed plotter. The processing of the digitized data by PHOTDIG produces terrain information required by engineers and planners such as state plane coordinates, elevations, cross-sections, profiles, etc. in both digital and graphical formats. The system has been in production use {{for over two years}} in the Portland District Photogrammetry Section and has significantly increased the efficiency and economy of photogrammetric data acquisition...|$|R
5|$|The {{music that}} would {{ultimately}} become the Hybrid Theory album was first produced by Linkin Park in 1999 as a <b>nine-track</b> demo <b>tape.</b> The band sent this tape to various recording companies and played forty-two different showcases for recording industry representatives, including performances for Los Angeles promoter and impresario, Mike Galaxy's showcase at The Gig on Melrose. However, they were initially {{turned down by}} most of the major labels and several independent record labels. The band was signed by Warner Bros. Records in 1999, {{due in large part to}} the constant recommendations of Jeff Blue, who had joined the label after resigning from Zomba.|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1995 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaThe Telemetry Data Distribution System (TDDS) {{solves the}} need to record, archive, and {{distribute}} sounding rocket and satellite data on a compact, user-friendly medium, such as CD-Recordable discs. The TDDS also archives telemetry data on floppy disks, <b>nine-track</b> <b>tapes,</b> and magneto-optical disc cartridges. The PC-based, semi-automated, TDDS digitizes, time stamps, formats, and archives frequency modulated (FM) or pulse code modulated (PCM) telemetry data. An analog tape or a real-time signal may provide the telemetry data source. The TDDS accepts IRIG A, B, G, H, and NASA 36 analog code sources for time stamp data. The output time tag includes time, frame, and subframe status information. Telemetry data may be time stamped based upon a user-specified number of frames, subframes, or words. Once recorded, the TDDS performs data quality testing, formatting, and validation and logs the results automatically. Telemetry data is quality checked to ensure a good analog source track was selected. Raw telemetry data is formatted by dividing the data into records and appending header information. The formatted telemetry data is validated by checking consecutive time tags and subframe identification counter values (if applicable) to identify data drop-outs. After validation, the TDDS archives the formatted data {{to any of the}} following media types: CD-Recordable (CD-R) Disc (650 megabytes capacity); nine track tape (180 megabytes capacity); and erasable optical disc (499 megabytes capacity). Additionally, previously archived science data may be re-formatted and archived to a different output media...|$|R

The GHIT is a <b>nine-track,</b> 1600 -BPI <b>tape</b> which {{conforms to the}} ANSI standard and serves as an inventory and description of the image data included in the shipment. The archival MSS tapes (HDT-AMs) contain radiometrically corrected but geometrically uncorrected image data plus certain ancillary data necessary to perform the geometric corrections...|$|R
40|$|Airborne {{microwave}} {{remote sensing}} measurements obtained by NASA Langley Research Center {{in support of the}} 1979 Norwegian Remote Sensing Experiment (NORSEX) are summarized. The objectives of NORSEX were to investigate the capabilities of an active/passive microwave system to measure ice concentration and type {{in the vicinity of the}} marginal ice zone near Svalbard, Norway and to apply microwave techniques to the investigation of a thermal oceanic front near Bear Island, Norway. The instruments used during NORSEX include the stepped frequency microwave radiometer, airborne microwave scatterometer, precision radiation thermometer and metric aerial photography. The data are inventoried, summarized, and presented in a user-friendly format. Data summaries are presented as time-history plots which indicate when and where data were obtained as well as the sensor configuration. All data are available on <b>nine-track</b> computer <b>tapes</b> in card-image format upon request to the NASA Langley Technical Library...|$|R
40|$|Between 1981 and 1986, in situ {{spectral}} gamma {{measurements were}} made from tracked vehicles {{as part of the}} Radionuclide Inventory and Distribution Program (RIDP) to document the distribution and develop inventories of 16 man-made radionuclides in surface soil from nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site. To preserve and permit more precise geospatial and other electronic analysis of the data, the raw spectral gamma measurements (units of nanocuries/m 2) were recovered from <b>nine-track</b> magnetic <b>tapes,</b> transferred to a flat-file database, and finally converted into a relational-design, desktop application in Microsoft Access 2000. To test the reliability of the measurement locations, the Nevada Grid Coordinate information was imported into Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) ArcMap to compare against plots in the 1991 RIDP summary report and against known field points. The resulting RIDP Database allows users to create files of the location and concentration where each radionuclide was detected, or files of all gamma measurements associated with a particular nuclear test. Maps can be generated showing where particular radionuclides were detected. For additional analysis, datasets can be exported to a hypertext markup language (HTML) format. Extensive use has been made of RIDP data prior to development of this database. However, there have been some inconsistencies in results because of use of interim results published prior to 1991, and because some half lives used when the data was collected are different than those used today. Two major steps were taken to standardize analysis using the RIDP database. First, only spectral gamma data decay corrected to January 1, 1990 was used. Second, currently accepted half lives for the radionuclides were incorporated into an option that allows decay correction of inventory and activity values since 1990. For long-lived radionuclides, changes in inventory have been inconsequential. However, for short-lived fission products (e. g., 60 Co, half life of 5. 27 years), changes because of radioactive decay were found to be significant. Comparison of spectral gamma data collected in 1994 from fixed winged aircraft to RIDP shows good correlation between areas of high contaminant concentration...|$|R
