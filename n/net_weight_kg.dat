In this sense, it was used the ARIMA/GARCH models, considering, likewise, the occurrence of a multiplicative stochastic seasonality in these series. They were collected 300 observations of exported <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> (<b>kg)</b> between Jan/ 1989 and Dec/ 2013 of the following fruits: pineapple, banana, orange, lemon, apple, papaya, mango, watermelon, melon and grape, which selection criteria was its importance in the exported basket fruit, because they represented 97 % of total received dollars, and 99 % of total volume sold in 2010, of a population about 28 kinds of exported fruits. The results showed that it was not only observed the existence of a 12 month multiplicative seasonality in banana and mango. On the other hand, they were identified two fruits groups: (1) those which are continuously exported, and (2) those which have export peaks. On the quality of the models, they were considered satisfactory for six of the ten fruits analyzed. On the volatility, it was seen a high persistence in banana and papaya series, pointing to the existence of a structural break in time series, which could be linked to the economic crises happened in the last 17 years...|$|E

FELICS (Fast Electromechanical Lightweight Ice Coring System), with a <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> of 228 <b>kg</b> for the complete drilling system including power supply, represents a new design. The main features are the absence of an outer barrel and a tilting table, and the use of a one-piece cutting ring, which simplify utilisation of the device and make it very efficient. In addition, FELICS is designed to be installed inside a protective tent, effectively allowing a 24 hour working day. The new drilling system has been successfully employed in the European Alps and in the Andes (on Cerro Tapado, Chile at 5536 m a. s. l., on Illimani, Bolivia at 6300 m a. s. l. and on Chimborazo, Ecuador at 6250 m a. s. l.) with a drilling performance of 136 m in only 6 working days.

40|$|Background & Aims: Therapeutic foods (RUTF) {{are used}} to treat severe acute {{malnutrition}} in children 5 years and under in low and middle income countries (LMI), while liquid nutritional supplements (ONS) are used in affluent societies. With globalisation and economic growth in LMI, {{there will be an}} inclination to move towards practices applied in affluent countries. This study compared the effect of supplementation with a RUTF and an ONS, on nutritional outcomes in mildly underweight children. Methods: 68 Pakistani (5 to 10 y), mildly underweight (weight Z-score: - 2 to - 1) children randomly received either RUTF or ONS (500 kcal/day), in addition to their habitual diet for four weeks. Weight, height, skinfolds and their changes during intervention, were compared between the two groups and at follow up, post-supplementation. Results: All nutritional outcomes and height improved with both supplements, but <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> gain (<b>kg)</b> and changes from baseline for weight, height, triceps and sub-scapular thickness Z-scores did not differ between the two supplements [mean (SD), RUTF vs ONS; <b>weight</b> gain (<b>kg),</b> 0. 59 (0. 30) vs 0. 65 (0. 42), p= 0. 483; weight Z-score, 0. 12 (0. 09) vs 0. 15 (0. 13), p= 0. 347; height Z-score, 0. 04 (0. 08) vs 0. 04 (0. 08), p= 0. 908; triceps Z-score, 0. 29 (0. 24) vs 0. 31 (0. 23), p= 0. 796; subscapular Z-score, 0. 37 (0. 29) vs 0. 31 (0. 25), p= 0. 385]. Weight gain (0. 6 kg) for both groups was lower than anticipated (2 kg). Post-supplementation, there was a tendency for weight and height Z-score to return to baseline. Conclusions: RUTF and ONS are equivalently effective in improving nutritional outcomes in children 5 to 10 y at risk of malnutrition but the observed benefit is less than expected and not sustainable.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Net</b> <b>weighting</b> {{is a key}} {{technique}} in timing driven placement (TDP), which {{plays a crucial role}} for deep submiron VLSI physical synthesis and timing closure. A popular way to assign <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> is based on its slack, such that the worst negative slack (WNS) of the entire circuit may be minimized. While WNS is an important optimization metric, another figure of merit (FOM), defined as the total slack difference compared to a certain slack threshold for all timing end points, is of equivalent importance to measure the overall timing closure result for highly complex modern ASIC and microprocessor designs. Moreover, to optimally assign <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> for timing closure, the effect of <b>net</b> <b>weighting</b> on timing should be carefully studied. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the wire length, slack and FOM sensitivities to the <b>net</b> <b>weight,</b> and propose a new <b>net</b> <b>weighting</b> scheme based on those sensitivities. Such sensitivity analysis implicitly takes potential physical synthesis effect into consideration.
