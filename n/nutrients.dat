5|$|Cnidarians feed {{in several}} ways: predation, {{absorbing}} dissolved organic chemicals, filtering food particles {{out of the}} water, obtaining <b>nutrients</b> from symbiotic algae within their cells, and parasitism. Most obtain {{the majority of their}} food from predation but some, including the corals Hetroxenia and Leptogorgia, depend almost completely on their endosymbionts and on absorbing dissolved <b>nutrients.</b> Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae carbon dioxide, some <b>nutrients,</b> a place in the sun and protection against predators.|$|E
5|$|Most {{laboratory}} {{techniques for}} growing bacteria use {{high levels of}} <b>nutrients</b> to produce large amounts of cells cheaply and quickly. However, in natural environments, <b>nutrients</b> are limited, meaning that bacteria cannot continue to reproduce indefinitely. This nutrient limitation has led the evolution of different growth strategies (see r/K selection theory). Some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when <b>nutrients</b> become available, such as the formation of algal (and cyanobacterial) blooms that often occur in lakes during the summer. Other organisms have adaptations to harsh environments, such as the production of multiple antibiotics by Streptomyces that inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms. In nature, many organisms live in communities (e.g., biofilms) that may allow for increased supply of <b>nutrients</b> and protection from environmental stresses. These relationships can be essential for growth of a particular organism or group of organisms (syntrophy).|$|E
5|$|Once {{the food}} is in the {{digestive}} cavity, gland cells in the gastroderm release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a few hours. This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the <b>nutrients.</b> Absorption may take a few hours, and digestion within the cells may take a few days. The circulation of <b>nutrients</b> is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that <b>nutrients</b> reach {{all parts of the}} digestive cavity. <b>Nutrients</b> reach the outer cell layer by diffusion or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick mesogleas, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.|$|E

40|$|Many {{physiological}} {{processes in}} phytoplankton, including <b>nutrient</b> uptake, vary {{on a number}} of temporal scales. Experiments show that the daily cycle in irradiance affects <b>nutrient</b> uptake rates. We used a Droop-based model of resource competition to investigate how diel variability in <b>nutrient</b> uptake influences phytoplankton competition and community structure. The analytical approximation we derive shows that if <b>nutrient</b> uptake is light dependent, the minimum <b>nutrient</b> requirements and, hence, <b>nutrient</b> competitive abilities depend on light regime in a species-specific way. Consequently, daily variations in irradiance may slow rates of competitive exclusion or reverse the identity of the superior competitor but not allow stable coexistence. Irradiance-induced fluctuations in the maximum <b>nutrient</b> uptake rate of the superior competitor can lead to fluctuations in ambient <b>nutrient</b> concentration and an increase in the average <b>nutrient</b> concentration compared to constant light conditions. This can enhance <b>nutrient</b> use by inferior competitors. These results may be applicable to bacteria–phytoplankton <b>nutrient</b> competition as well. Depending on {{the costs and benefits of}} maintaining <b>nutrient</b> uptake in the dark, different strategies of <b>nutrient</b> use are optimal under different light regimes. Our results suggest that by mediating limiting <b>nutrient</b> use, fluctuations in irradiance may alter the structure of phytoplankton communities.

40|$|Plant roots exude {{numerous}} metabolites {{into the}} soil that influence <b>nutrient</b> availability. Although root exudate composition is hypothesized to be under selection in low fertility soils, few studies have tested this hypothesis in a phylogenetic framework. In this study, we examined root exudates of three pairs of Helianthus species chosen as phylogenetically-independent contrasts with respect to native soil <b>nutrient</b> availability. Under controlled environmental conditions, seedlings were grown to the three-leaf-pair stage, then transferred to either high or low <b>nutrient</b> treatments. After five days of <b>nutrient</b> treatments, we used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for analysis of root exudates, and detected 37 metabolites across species. When compared in the high <b>nutrient</b> treatment, species native to low <b>nutrient</b> soils exhibited overall higher exudation than their sister species native to high <b>nutrient</b> soils in all three species pairs, providing support for repeated evolutionary shifts in response to native soil fertility. Species native to low <b>nutrient</b> soils and those native to high <b>nutrient</b> soils responded similarly to low <b>nutrient</b> treatments with increased exudation of organic acids (fumaric, citric, malic acids) and glucose, potentially as a mechanism to enhance nutrition acquisition. However, species native to low <b>nutrient</b> soils also responded to low <b>nutrient</b> treatments with a larger decrease in exudation of amino acids than species native to high <b>nutrient</b> soils in all three species pairs. This indicates that species native to low <b>nutrient</b> soils have evolved a unique sensitivity to changes in <b>nutrient</b> availability for some, but not all, root exudates. Overall, these repeated evolutionary divergences between species native to low <b>nutrient</b> soils and those native to high <b>nutrient</b> soils provide evidence for the adaptive value of root exudation, and its plasticity, in contrasting soil environments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A <b>nutrient</b> balance was {{determined}} for sole and alley cropped Sorghum bicolor and Acacia saligna in a runoff irrigation system in Northern Kenya. <b>Nutrient</b> input including precipitation and runoff, and output through harvest and leaching were measured for N, P, K, Ca and Mg using adsorption resins, tensiometry and suction cups. Various management scenarios are discussed {{with respect to}} <b>nutrient</b> return. <b>Nutrient</b> input with rainfall was generally low in comparison to <b>nutrient</b> uptake or leaching losses. The irrigation water, however, constituted an important <b>nutrient</b> input, especially for Ca and Mg. <b>Nutrient</b> export with the harvest was large for N and K, but can effectively be reduced by a <b>nutrient</b> return with mulch. <b>Nutrient</b> leaching losses from the topsoil (0 – 30 cm) were lower in the sorghum monoculture than in the treebased systems. In the subsoil (120 cm), however, leaching was effectively reduced by the trees. In the agroforestry system, leaching losses of N under the sorghum were 53 % lower than in the sorghum monoculture. This {{could be attributed to}} a higher root abundance and a higher ratio of <b>nutrient</b> uptake-to-leaching in the agroforestry system than in the monocultures indicating a higher <b>nutrient</b> efficiency. The lower leaching losses in the agroforestry system compared to the crop monoculture could not compensate for the additional <b>nutrient</b> export in tree biomass.

40|$|Abstract. Free-living birds must satisfy {{fluctuating}} <b>nutrient</b> {{requirements in}} diverse and varying environments. Ingesting nutritionally complementary foods {{may be the}} most effective means by which wild birds match <b>nutrient</b> ingestion and <b>nutrient</b> needs. Dietary complementation may occur fortuitously when foods chosen in response to non-nutritive factors (e. g. competition, predation risk, food colour), or on the basis of energy density, also fulfill specific <b>nutrient</b> needs (passive dietary complementation). In some environments, especially during productive phases (e. g. reproduction), free-living birds may rely on <b>nutrient</b> appetites to ensure their choice of foods satisfies their <b>nutrient</b> needs (active dietary complementation). Meeting <b>nutrient</b> needs through dietary complementation can be facilitated, complicated, or impeded by any of several environmental or organism determinants of food choice. <b>Nutrient</b> appetites, exogenous food stores, and endogenous <b>nutrient</b> stores are three organismal determinants that are probably the most important in facilitating dietary complementation...|$|R
40|$|Duke, JoshuaReducing excess {{nitrogen}} and phosphorous (<b>nutrient)</b> runoff into ground and surface waters {{is a global}} concern (Jacobs, 2013). More than two decades of effort in the United States Chesapeake Bay region to reduce <b>nutrient</b> excess has seen slow progress (U. S. EPA, 2010). The externality of <b>nutrient</b> excess has spurred environmental groups to seek rights they view as unallocated in resolution processes. This dissertation presents several ideas regarding <b>nutrient</b> externality. The second chapter argues that the judicial process is poorly positioned to resolve this conflict—relative to other resolution processes—and other processes {{would be more likely}} for environmental groups to achieve their goal of improving environmental quality. The third chapter addresses the design and implementation of effective policy for <b>nutrient</b> reduction from nonpoint source agriculture. <b>Nutrient</b> management planning and <b>nutrient</b> trading requirements are comparatively analyzed in Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia to determine factors in policy design that affect policy outputs. The results indicate that an existing institutional structure utilizing incentive-based <b>nutrient</b> management planning may be more compatible with <b>nutrient</b> trading policies and in turn may reduce the cost of monitoring. Although monitoring cost increase with <b>nutrient</b> trading, the existing policy design in Virginia may provide capacity to lower monitoring cost. The fourth chapter analyzes payment for environmental services (PES) and <b>nutrient</b> trading with a novel approach. A <b>nutrient</b> index combines PES for {{nitrogen and}} phosphorous reduction and a sensitivity analysis, into a single payment to elicit potential costs of supply in the <b>nutrient</b> market. This <b>nutrient</b> index is {{the first of its kind}} to distinguish payments made for multiple environmental services and to explore the impact on policy effectiveness with overlapping <b>nutrient</b> reduction policies. PES and <b>nutrient</b> trading policies pay for the same service yet PES, as demonstrated in the results of this study, has potential to increase prices of <b>nutrient</b> credits (establish a price floor) or collapse the <b>nutrient</b> trading market altogether. In addition, the existence of the trading market has potential to reduce the effectiveness of existing PES, which already suffers from ineffective payment for <b>nutrient</b> services. Ph. D.

5|$|Bacterial growth follows four phases. When a {{population}} of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the lag phase, a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of growth is the log phase, {{also known as the}} logarithmic or exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate (k), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time (g). During log phase, <b>nutrients</b> are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the <b>nutrients</b> is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted <b>nutrients.</b> The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of <b>nutrients</b> and die.|$|E
