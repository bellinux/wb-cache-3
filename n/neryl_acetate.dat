There was some activity against Enterococcus fecalis, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus cereus, indicating important biological activities of the oil...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to analyse the {{chemical}} composition and antimicrobial properties of essential oils isolated from two wild-growing species of thyme (Thymus pulegioides L. and T. glabrescens Willd.) originating from different locations in Romania. The yield of essential oil was determined according to European Pharmacopoeia standards. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the oils was performed using GC and GC/MS. The antimicrobial activity was tested by the microdilution technique against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, S. enteritisdis, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, M. flavus and Listeria monocytogenes) and human pathogen yeast Candida albicans. The essential oil of Thymus pulegioides was obtained in a yield of 0. 7 – 1 % (v/d. w. herbal drug) and the main components were carvacrol (50. 5 – 62. 6 %), g-terpinene (9. 8 – 9. 9 %) and p-cymene (5. 8 – 7. 1 %). The essential oil of T. glabrescens was obtained in a yield of 0. 7 (v/d. w. herbal drug) and the main components were geraniol (55. 5 %), <b>neryl</b> <b>acetate</b> (11. 1 %) and β-bisabolene (6. 7 %). The essential oils inhibited microbial growth at concentrations of 10. 8 – 27 μl/ml...|$|E
40|$|The {{composition}} of 21 essential-oil samples isolated from Helichrysum italicum collected in seven locations of Elba Island (Tuscany, Italy), characterized by different soil types, during three different periods (January, May, and October 2010) {{was determined by}} GC-FID and GC/EI-MS analyses. In total, 115 components were identified, representing 96. 8 – 99. 8 % of the oil composition. The oils were characterized by a high content of oxygenated monoterpenes (38. 6 – 62. 7 %), while monoterpene and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons accounted for 2. 3 – 41. 9 and 5. 1 – 20. 1 % of the identified constituents, respectively. The main oxygenated derivatives were nerol (2. 8 – 12. 8 %) and its ester derivative <b>neryl</b> <b>acetate</b> (5. 6 – 45. 9 %). To compare the chemical variability of the species within Elba Island and between the island and other localities within the Mediterranean area, studied previously, multivariate statistical analysis was performed. The results obtained showed {{a difference in the}} {{composition of}} the essential oils of H. italicum from Elba Island, mainly due to the environment where the plant grows, and, in particular, to the soil type. These hypotheses were further confirmed by the comparison of these oils with essential oils obtained from H. italicum collected on other islands of the Tuscan archipelag...|$|E
40|$|Red and far-red {{light that}} {{influence}} plant morphology and phenology may {{play an important}} role in modulate essential oil production of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.). In a study on the growth, development, and essential oil production of rosemary growing in a glasshouse, the addition of end-of-day light treatment with red (660 nm) and far-red (730 nm) light had significant effects on the content and constituents of essential oil as compared with control plants not exposed to light treatments. Potted rosemary seedlings (10 – 13 cm tall) exposed to red or far-red light for 3 h beginning 15 min before sunset for 28 days varied in levels of limonene, bornyl acetate, α-cedrene, neril acetate, α-pinene, camphene, p-cymene, α-terpinolene, and geranyl acetate production as compared with controls. Far-red light promoted and red light inhibited the synthesis of -pinene, camphene, and p-cymene. Red light promoted the synthesis of limonene and bornyl acetate, -cedrene, and <b>neryl</b> <b>acetate.</b> Far-red light increased and red light decreased oil production as compared with non-lighted control. Both red and far-red light treatments induced plant growth variations with both red and far-red treated seedlings exposed to end-of-day light were taller than controls. The far-red light treatment significantly increased internode length as compared with the control...|$|E
40|$|Background and objectives: Dracocephalum kotschyi is a plant which {{belongs to}} the Lamiaceae family and exists mostly in {{south-west}} Asian countries, including Iran. This plant is used as antispasmodic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory to treat rheumatoid diseases. Methods: In order to investigate {{the impact of the}} harvesting time changes on {{the quantity and quality of}} mono- and sesquiterpenoid components of D. kotschyi aerial parts, ten samples were collected from cultivated plants from 19 April to 27 August 2013. Also samples of flower and root were harvested in order to investigate their essential oil components. The essential oils were obtained through hydrodistillation method. The components were studied and identified by GC and GC ⁄ MS systems. Results: The highest yield of the essential oil was obtained on 3 May (1. 10 % V. W) and the lowest on 28 July (0. 29 % V. W). Totally 55 compounds were identified in the essential oil while the highest percentage belonged to monoterpenes especially the oxygenated ones. Most variations were observed in geraniol (1. 40 - 15. 34 %), geranyl acetate (trace- 14. 41 %) and <b>neryl</b> <b>acetate</b> (0. 62 - 17. 51 %). The major value in most cases belonged to geranial. Conclusion: the results of this study indicate that the harvesting time of plant is an effective factor in the quality and quantity of theessential oil of Dracocephalum kotschyi...|$|E
