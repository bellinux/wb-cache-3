50|$|The pollinators land on {{the lower}} lip. On the rear part of the lip are two glands that secrete nectar which is {{collected}} in small cavities immediately below them. The access to the nectar is very narrow to by the protruding edge of the column and the glands, and will cause the tongue of the bumblebee or bee to tear a membrane that covers {{the base of the}} two pollinia. As a result, the bees tongue comes into contact with an adhesive which hardens directly when exposed to the air. When the tongue is retracted the pollinia cling to it. The lip of flowers that is a few day more matured has opened further making access to the <b>nectar</b> <b>gland</b> wider and making the tongue brush past the stigma and deliver the pollen. Such a flower which develops first to release the pollen, and is later adapted to be pollinated is called protandrous.|$|E
50|$|The large (5-5½ × 2-2½ cm), {{more or less}} pendulant, star-symmetrical, {{hermaphrodite}} flowers stand individually in the axil of {{the leaves}} on a short flower stem. The calyx consists of eight to ten, free, concave, and spirally arranged sepals which gradually increase in size from outer to inner, overlap in the bud, and do not fall after flowering. These sepals are approximately oval in shape, leathery in consistency and are covered in simple one-celled straight or slightly curved hairs of 0.2-0.6 mm. Sepals and petals both contain crystals of various shapes and mucilaginous cells. The five (or sometimes six) free petals are oval, {{much larger than the}} sepals, also overlap in the bud, but fall off after flowering, with a range in form that includes inverted egg-shaped. The petals are thick, cream to yellow in color, sometimes with a purple blush, and with an irregular pattern of brown or red veins. The ten free filaments are the same color as the petals, thick, gradually tapering upwards, 4-5¼ cm long, ½ cm broad, and carry facing the style an anther that is connected at midlength with the filament. The dark brownish anthers open with slits to the sides to release the cream-colored pollen. Pollen is triangular with very short slits at each of the corners and lacks further adornment. The outer margin of the disc is a very distinct narrow circular ridge-shaped <b>nectar</b> <b>gland</b> with ten side-ridges radiating out. The four to seven carpels are fused and carry a single, long, straight style which is topped by a lobed stigma. The style is not shed after flowering.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{variation}} of floral morphology and its ef-fect on the flower visitors of Polygala vayredae Costa (Polygalaceae), a narrow endemic species from the Or-iental pre-Pyrenees, were examined. First, {{to account for}} the main floral reward (i. e., nectar), the relationship between the dimensions of the <b>nectar</b> <b>gland</b> and nectar production was investigated. Second, floral traits varia-tion was assessed within and between the three most representative populations of the species. Finally, the role of several floral traits in the female fitness was evaluated. Furthermore, as nectar robbing was highly frequent, preferences of robbers for specific floral traits and their impact on legitimate pollinations were also evaluated. The flowers of this species are characterized by significant variations in floral characteristics and nectar rewards. A significant and positive correlation between the <b>nectar</b> <b>gland</b> dimensions and nectar pro-duction per flower was observed, with the gland dimensions being a good measure to infer the rewards offered by the flowers of P. vayredae. In general, corolla traits were significant and positively correlated with each other. Nectar was revealed to be an important trait in flower–visitor interactions, with legitimate pollinations being primarily influenced by this floral reward. Nega-tive correlations between robbing frequency and legiti-mate pollinations were observed in two of the studied populations, and positive correlations between flower size and robbing frequency were observed in one pop-ulation. An indirect negative selection over phenotypic floral traits mediated by nectar robbers is proposed...|$|E

50|$|Because {{the ants}} compete for {{exclusive}} usage {{of a given}} tree, some species employ tactics to reduce {{the chance of a}} hostile ant invasion. Crematogaster nigriceps ants trim the buds of trees to reduce lateral growth in trees, thereby reducing chances of contact with a neighboring tree. Tetraponera penzigi, the only species which does not utilize the nectar produced by the trees, instead destroys the <b>nectar</b> <b>glands</b> {{in order to make a}} tree less appealing to other species.|$|R
50|$|In Euphorbia, flowers {{occur in}} a head, called the cyathium (plural cyathia). Each male or female flower in the cyathium head has only its {{essential}} sexual part, in males the stamen, and in females the pistil. The flowers do not have sepals, petals, or nectar to attract pollen, although other nonflower parts of the plant have an appearance and <b>nectar</b> <b>glands</b> with similar roles. Euphorbias are the only plants known {{to have this kind}} of flower head.|$|R
5000|$|The female flowers {{reduced to}} a single pistil usually split into three parts, often with two stigmas at each tip. Male flowers often have anthers in twos. <b>Nectar</b> <b>glands</b> usually occur in fives, may be as few as one, and may be fused into a [...] "U" [...] shape.

It also differs in having a triangular lid, as opposed to the [...] lid of N. izumiae. Furthermore, N. lingulata completely lacks <b>nectar</b> <b>glands</b> on the underside of the lid and has a very dense woolly indumentum.|$|R
5000|$|Upper {{pitchers}} {{are more}} infundibular than their lower counterparts, but also reach large dimensions {{of up to}} 28.5 cm. In aerial pitchers, the lid is much more narrowly triangular.

50|$|Although long {{confused}} with N. vieillardii, N. lamii {{can be distinguished}} from that species {{on the basis of}} several stable differences. Nepenthes lamii almost completely lacks an indumentum on mature parts, whereas N. vieillardii bears a sparse to dense covering of white hairs measuring around 1 mm in length. In addition, the peristome ribs of N. lamii are usually more widely spaced at 0.3-0.4 mm apart versus 0.2-0.3 mm in N. vieillardii. The density of <b>nectar</b> <b>glands</b> {{on the underside of the}} lid is also much higher in N. lamii (1500-2000 glands/cm2 versus 75-100 glands/cm2).|$|R
5000|$|In their {{description}} of N. ovata, Andreas Wistuba and Joachim Nerz compared the species to N. singalana. They noted that N. ovata differs in having an [...] lamina apex, whereas N. singalana has a rounded apex. The two species also {{differ in the}} distribution of <b>nectar</b> <b>glands</b> {{on the underside of the}} lid. Nepenthes ovata has numerous glands near the midrib and is densely glandular near and on the hook-shaped appendage. In comparison, N. singalana is only sparsely glandular near the midrib and bears no glands near the lid apex.|$|R
5000|$|The {{leaves of}} this species are [...] and [...] to sub-. The lamina is oblong- in shape and up to 40 cm long by 10 cm wide. It has an acute apex and is {{gradually}} [...] towards the base.

Between 30 and 60 <b>nectar</b> <b>glands</b> are present on the lower surface of the lamina. Tendrils are up to 100 cm long.|$|R
5000|$|With the former, N. izumiae {{shares the}} general {{morphology}} and colouration of its pitchers. However, {{it can be}} easily distinguished from that species as it lacks the highly developed filiform appendage that gives N. lingulata its name.
