40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new approach for a unified theory for continuous and discrete time (optimal) control problems based on the generalized Cayley transformation. We also relate the associated discrete and continuous generalized algebraic Riccati equations. We demonstrate the potential of this new approach by proving a new result for discrete algebraic Riccati equations. But we also discuss where this new approach {{as well as all}} other approaches still is <b>nonsatisfactory.</b> We explain a discrepancy observed between the discrete and continuous case and show that this discrepancy is partly due to the consideration of the wrong analogues. We also present an idea for an implication scheme that relates general theorems for discrete and continuous control problems...|$|E
40|$|This article studies {{aggregation}} {{operators in}} ordinal scales for their application to clustering (more specifically, to microaggregation for statistical disclosure risk). In particular, we consider these operators {{in the process}} of prototype construction. This study analyzes main aggregation operators for ordinal scales [plurality rule, medians, Sugeno integrals (SI), and ordinal weighted means (OWM), among others] and shows the difficulties for their application in this particular setting. Then, we propose two approaches to solve the drawbacks and we study their properties. Special emphasis is given to the study of monotonicity because the operator is proven <b>nonsatisfactory</b> for this property. Exhaustive empirical work shows that in most practical situations, this cannot be considered a problem. 2003 Wiley Periodicals, In...|$|E
40|$|The {{replacement}} of single anterior teeth {{by means of}} endosseous implants implies the achievement of success in restoring both aesthetic and function. However, the presence of wide endoperiodontal lesions can lead to horizontal hard and soft tissues defects after tooth extraction, {{making it impossible to}} correctly place an implant in the compromised alveolar socket. Vertical augmentation procedures have been proposed to solve these clinical situations, but the amount of new regenerated bone is still not predictable. Furthermore, bone augmentation can be complicated by the presence of adjacent teeth, especially if they bring with them periodontal defects. Therefore, it is used to restore periodontal health of adjacent teeth before making any augmentation procedures and to wait a certain healing period before placing an implant in vertically augmented sites, otherwise risking to obtain a <b>nonsatisfactory</b> aesthetic result. All of these procedures, however, lead to an expansion of treatment time which should affect patient compliance. For this reason, this case report suggests a surgical technique to perform vertical bone augmentation at a single gap left by a central upper incisor while placing an implant and simultaneously to regenerate the periodontal attachment of an adjacent lateral incisor, without compromising the aesthetic result...|$|E
40|$|Virtual reality {{simulator}} {{training has}} become important for acquiring arthroscopic skills. A new simulator for knee arthroscopy ArthroS™ has been developed. The {{purpose of this}} study was to demonstrate face and construct validity, executed according to a protocol used previously to validate arthroscopic simulators. Twenty-seven participants were divided into three groups having different levels of arthroscopic experience. Participants answered questions regarding general information and the outer appearance of the simulator for face validity. Construct validity was assessed with one standardized navigation task. Face validity, educational value and user friendliness were further determined by giving participants three exercises and by asking them to fill out the questionnaire. Construct validity was demonstrated between experts and beginners. Median task times were not significantly different for all repetitions between novices and intermediates, and between intermediates and experts. Median face validity was 8. 3 for the outer appearance, 6. 5 for the intra-articular joint and 4. 7 for surgical instruments. Educational value and user friendliness were perceived as <b>nonsatisfactory,</b> especially because of the lack of tactile feedback. The ArthroS™ demonstrated construct validity between novices and experts, but did not demonstrate full face validity. Future improvements should be mainly focused on the development of tactile feedback. It is necessary that a newly presented simulator is validated to prove it actually contributes to proficiency of skill...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{establish}} –among {{other things}} – existence and multiplicity of {{solutions for the}} Dirichlet problem ∑ i ∂iiu+ |u| 2 ⋆ − 2 u |x | s = 0 on smooth bounded domains Ω of Rn (n≥ 3) involving the critical Hardy-Sobolev exponent 2 ⋆ = 2 (n−s) where 0 < s < 2, {{and in the case}} where zero (the point of singularity) is n− 2 on the boundary ∂Ω. Just as in the Yamabe-type non-singular framework (i. e., when s = 0), there is no nontrivial solution under global convexity assumption (e. g., when Ω is star-shaped around 0). However, in contrast to the <b>nonsatisfactory</b> situation of the non-singular case, we show the existence of an infinite number of solutions under an assumption of local strict concavity of ∂Ω at 0 in at least one direction. More precisely, we need the principal curvatures of ∂Ω at 0 to be non-positive but not all vanishing. We also show that the best constant in the Hardy-Sobolev inequality is attained as long as the mean curvature of ∂Ω at 0 is negative, extending the results of [21] and completing our result of [22] to include dimension 3. The key ingredients in our proof are refined concentration estimates which yield compactness for certain Palais-Smale sequences which do not hold in the non-singular case...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is {{identifying}} and analysing the creation of economic value in an agroindustrial cooperative {{in the south of}} Minas Gerais, using the EVAÂ® (Economic Value Added). In specific terms, we sought to analysing investment, financing of operational capital, and the financial structure of the cooperative as bases for the creation of economic value. In that sense the work had as theorical background, the aspects concerning financial management based on value creation, preceeded by a literature review on cooperativism with an emphasis on the specificities of the structure of capital in cooperative organizations. The research was carried out by means of a case study starting out from the financial statements of 1995 through 1999, furnished by the cooperative. The analitical model used was the Fleuriet Model which, through the measurement of its characteristic variables provides a dynamic analysis of companies’ financial management. Results indicated destruction of economic value, that is, the operational results of the cooperative were not able to provide a reward of invested capital. A demand of resources for the maintainance and development of its operational activities was also verified. The combination of the characteristic variables of the Fleuriet Model enabled the identification of two basic financial structures: the solid one and the <b>nonsatisfactory</b> one. agro-industrial cooperative, economic value, financial structure.,...|$|E
40|$|Efforts {{to reduce}} the {{severity}} of postradiotherapy xero-stomia {{include the use of}} salivary substitutes to gain symptomatic relief, salivary gland stimulants, agents delivered to protect the glands during radiotherapy (RT), and physical means to partially spare the major salivary glands from RT while adequately irradiating tumor targets. These means include advanced RT treat-ment planning and salivary tissue transfer to nonirradi-ated areas. The relative potential gain from each of these strategies is discussed in this article. The combi-nation of partial salivary gland sparing and radiation protectors/stimulants may provide additive or syner-gistic gains in reducing the severity of xerostomia. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. The prevalence of xerostomia after radiother-apy (RT) of head and neck cancer, its poten-tial complications and effects on quality of life (QOL), and metrics for its measurement and reporting were discussed in the accompanying article in this issue of Seminars in Radiation Oncol-ogy. 1 This article discusses the relative efficacy of the various methods used to prevent xerostomia or decrease its severity and suggests directions for future research. Salivary Substitutes Salivary substitutes containing mucins, car-boxymethylcellulose, or other ingredients thought to duplicate the rheological properties of saliva have been developed for many years, and many commercial products are available. In most cases they are found to be <b>nonsatisfactory</b> by patients, 2 and randomized studies have found no difference in patient comfort between salivary substitutes and water or placebo. 3,...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{fluctuations}} in free polyamines, spermidine, spermine, putrescine and potassium concentrations were studied {{for two years}} (1992 – 1993) in three needle years of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) grown on a drained mire in western Finland. Seven different fertilizer treatments involving five different sources of potassium were used. Putrescine concentrations were high in winter and in May but low in summer. High peaks in putrescine in March and May {{could be found in}} non-refertilized or rock phosphate treatments. Spermidine and spermine concentrations were high in March and May. In December spermine concentrations were low. Biotite increased the needle potassium concentrations less than the other potassium fertilizers but the putrescine concentrations or the putrescine/spermidine ratio to about the same level. This suggests that biotite, although very slowly soluble, can reasonably satisfy potassium nutrition of young pine trees. The potassium concentrations of needles in all the fertilization treatments were higher in winter than in summer. The response of putrescine to the potassium concentration was strongly negative in all the needle years and sampling times. In March, May and December the response of putrescine to potassium was fairly similar in both years but not in June and August. The results suggest that the potassium concentrations during the growing season cannot be used for estimating the potassium nutrition of trees, because the variation between the years may be substantial, whereas the needle putrescine concentration or putrescine/spermidine ratio indicates the suboptimum potassium status of Scots pine fairly well. Needle putrescine concentrations over 500 nmol g– 1 FW quite regularly coincided with a <b>nonsatisfactory</b> potassium nutrition and concentrations over 1000 nmol g– 1 FW were a reliable indication of potassium deficiency. Putrescine/spermidine ratios below 5 indicated a satisfactory potassium nutrition in all needle years throughout the year...|$|E
