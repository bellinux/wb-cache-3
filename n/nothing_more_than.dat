5|$|As of 2008, {{there has}} been little {{response}} to Pozdniakov's approach. However, Sproat (2007) believes that the results from the frequency distributions are <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> an effect of Zipf's Law, and furthermore that neither rongorongo nor the old texts were representative of the Rapanui language, so that a comparison between them is unlikely to be enlightening.|$|E

5|$|The concerto {{also calls}} on the soloist to be <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> an accompanist to the {{orchestra}} for extended periods, such as the ricochet arpeggios {{at the start of}} the recapitulation. This too was novel for a violin concerto of its time.|$|E
5|$|Aspasia, who {{was noted}} for her {{ability as a}} conversationalist and adviser, was accused of corrupting the women of Athens {{in order to satisfy}} Pericles' perversions. The accusations against her were {{probably}} <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> unproven slanders, but the whole experience was very bitter for Pericles. Although Aspasia was acquitted thanks to a rare emotional outburst of Pericles, his friend, Phidias, died in prison and another friend of his, Anaxagoras, was attacked by the ecclesia for his religious beliefs.|$|E

5|$|Carpentier was {{influenced}} {{by a number of}} authors. Jean Price Mars's Ainsi parla l'oncle (So Spoke the Uncle) presents two arguments that Carpentier applied to his historical approach: firstly, {{from the perspective of a}} Haitian peasant, the Revolution did <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> replace leaders, since the exploitation continued; secondly, Price Mars assumes the authenticity of the belief in African gods, in contrast with a shallow Catholicism. William Seabrook's The Magic Island made connections between religion and history and was considered a beautiful book by Carpentier.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{immediately}} after God of War II, Kratos, Gaia, {{and the other}} Titans ascend Mount Olympus to destroy the Olympian Gods. Poseidon launches a counter-assault against the Titans but is killed by Kratos and Gaia; his death causes the oceans to flood the world. Reaching the peak of Olympus, they try to attack Zeus, but he drives them back and knocks them off the mountain. Gaia clings to the mountainside and refuses to save Kratos, calling him <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a pawn for the Titans' revenge.|$|E
5|$|Enterprising programmers {{were able}} to produce games for the ZX81 using <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> text {{characters}} and the machine's limited text semigraphics. Some ZX81 games achieved lasting fame, such as 3D Monster Maze, a tense first-person perspective game that involved the player escaping a labyrinth with a Tyrannosaurus rex in pursuit. Written in a combination of BASIC and machine code, its innovative design led it to be hailed as the first home computer 3D game and a landmark {{in the history of}} computer and video games.|$|E

He {{is in love with}} Delores, but lacks the passion he felt for his beloved Maria back home. Cesar, meantime, {{suppresses}} his true feelings, that a woman like Delores would actually be perfect for him. Cesar eventually reveals to Nestor that Maria left him for a Cuban mobster in exchange for cancelling a contract hit against Nestor.|$|E
5|$|Following the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantines {{were left}} in an {{unstable}} position. The capture of Constantinople in 1261 and subsequent campaigning did not come at a good time — the weakening of the Sultanate of Rum resulted in many beyliks breaking away as autonomous states, such as the Emirate founded by Osman I. Although this weakening of power gave the Empire of Nicaea a temporary free hand, it was <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a small respite not capitalized {{as much as it}} could have been.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, audiences {{had a very}} {{different}} take on his work. Many perceived it as a subversive and Marxist satire on American capitalism. If not subversive, {{it was at least}} considered a Marxist critique of pop culture. Given Warhol's apolitical outlook in general this is not likely the intended message. It is likely that his pop art was <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> an attempt to attract attention to his work.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} season premiere, Blair {{continues}} to plan her wedding, but begins to encounter problems in {{her relationship with}} Louis. It is later revealed that she is pregnant.

5|$|Many Sunnis (who {{compromise}} {{a substantial}} minority) support {{the government and}} see the Thirteen as dangerous revolutionaries that would destabilize the country should they succeed in toppling the monarchy. Government hardliners and Sunni political groups often call for harsh and no compromise approach, including calling for no pardons and death sentences. To their many supporters (in Bahrain and abroad) however, the Thirteen are heroes and prisoners of conscience jailed unfairly for <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> calling for democracy. Their faces appear daily in banners during protests.|$|E

In 30 AD, his brother, Drusus Caesar, was imprisoned on charges of treason and his brother Nero died in exile from either starvation or suicide.

5|$|The {{explanation}} for the green and red colours {{that make up the}} background field arose during the Estado Novo period, the nationalist authoritarian regime that held power from 1933 to 1974.

Sources believe these noble meanings are far from the truth and are <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> propaganda, to provide an honourable justification to their choice.|$|E
