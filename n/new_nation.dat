5|$|By 1796, {{the end of}} George Washington's eighth year as {{president}} of the United States, the United States' strategic position was dire.

Later on, Abdul Qayyum Khan was put in place by Jinnah in the Pashtun-dominated province despite his being a Kashmiri. On 12 August 1948 the Babrra massacre in Charsadda occurred there, resulting in the death of 400 people aligned with the Khudai Khidmatgar movement.|$|E

Jinnah died at age 71 in September 1948, {{just over a year}} after Pakistan gained independence from the United Kingdom. He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan.

Wagga Wagga became a garrison town during World War II with the establishment of a military base at Kapooka and Royal Australian Air Force bases at Forest Hill and Uranquinty. After the war, Wagga Wagga was proclaimed as a city in 1946 and new suburbs were developed to the south of the city. In 1982 the city was amalgamated with the neighbouring Kyeamba and Mitchell Shires to form the City of Wagga Wagga local government area.|$|E

5|$|Following Mexico's {{independence}} from Spain, the <b>new</b> <b>nation</b> established long-term settlements, including Anahuac and San Jacinto, around the bay. Early rebellions by the settlers against Mexican rule {{occurred in the}} region and it was later the site of the victory of the Texas army over the Mexican army during the Texas Revolution. Following Texas' {{independence from}} Mexico and its annexation by the United States, economic growth was centered initially on agriculture and cattle ranching. Commerce grew between Galveston, Harrisburg and Houston in the later 19th century, and created additional economic opportunities as railroads were built through the Bay Area to connect these and other commercial centers.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{declaration}} of independence from Spain the <b>new</b> <b>nation</b> of Mexico moved to colonize its northern territory of Texas by offering land grants to settlers both from within Mexico and from the nearby United States. Small settlements such as Lynchburg and San Jacinto were gradually established around the bay and in 1830 Mexican authorities created a customs and garrison post at Anahuac commanded by Juan Davis Bradburn.Henson (1982), p. 49.Henson (1982), p. 51.Galveston Bay Estuary Program (2002), p. 27–28. Conflicts between Bradburn and the settlers in the region led to the Anahuac Disturbances, a prelude to the larger Texas rebellion that was to come. Following a coup in the Mexican government many freedoms previously enjoyed by the Texans were revoked causing Texas to revolt and declare its independence in 1835. After a number of battles the Texas army, {{under the leadership of}} General Sam Houston, finally defeated the Mexican Army in the Battle of San Jacinto, near modern Pasadena.|$|E
5|$|Hearing of the unrest, Ottawa sent three emissaries to the Red River, {{including}} HBC representative Donald Alexander Smith. While {{they were}} en route, the Métis National Committee declared a provisional government on 8 December, with Riel becoming its president on 27 December. Meetings between Riel and the Ottawa delegation {{took place on}} 5 and 6 January 1870, but when these proved fruitless, Smith chose to present his case in a public forum. Smith assured large audiences of the Government's goodwill in meetings on 19 and 20 January, leading Riel to propose {{the formation of a}} new convention split evenly between French and English settlers to consider Smith's instructions. On 7 February, a new list of rights was presented to the Ottawa delegation, and Smith and Riel agreed to send representatives to Ottawa to engage in direct negotiations on that basis. The provisional government established by Louis Riel published its own newspaper titled <b>New</b> <b>Nation</b> and established the Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia to pass laws.|$|E

In the Second World War, the Church condemned Nazism, and protected hundreds of thousands of Jews from the Holocaust; its efforts, however, have been criticised as inadequate. After the war, freedom of religion was severely restricted in the Communist countries newly aligned with the Soviet Union, several of which had large Catholic populations.|$|E

All of these vessels were formally taken over by the KSCS at the beginning of March 1921.

In contrast {{to the other two}} Southern branch mints, which only minted gold coinage, the New Orleans Mint produced both gold and silver coins, and in much greater quantities and total value, which marked it as the most important branch mint in the country until the San Francisco Mint began minting a large monetary value of gold coins in the mid 1850s.|$|E
