40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the role and the {{effectiveness}} of the role of <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors.</b> The main objective of the thesis is to create a legal model that applies to the nonexecutive directors and enhances their role, in order to achieve the corporate governance goals including controlling the management of the company, reducing agency costs and mitigating the problems arising from the separation of ownership and control. The thesis critically analyses the role of <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> by using the different ‘hard law’ and ‘soft law’ sources applicable to the <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors,</b> and by referring to major corporate governance theories related, such as the separation of ownership and control, and the agency costs. The analysis found that the corporate governance reforms do not enhance the role {{and the effectiveness of}} the role of the <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors,</b> as the reforms focus on the structure of the board directors and the appointment of independent <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors,</b> but do not deal efficiently with the actual performance of the <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors.</b> The thesis proposes a legal model to apply to <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> which ensures the quality of the actual work of the <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors.</b> The proposed legal model takes in consideration that modern corporate governance role of the <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> and provides an enforcement method through a panel specialized in the cases regarding the <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study explores how <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> are {{challenged}} by management while {{they seek to}} improve the effectiveness of supervisory boards in the Netherlands. A combination of semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire among <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> indicates that supervisory board members mainly experience boardroom challenges in three core areas: the ability of <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> to ask management critical questions, information asymmetries between the management and supervisory boards and {{the management of the}} relationship between individual executive and <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors.</b> The qualitative in-depth analysis reveals the complexity of the main contributing factors to problems in the boardroom as well as the range of process and social interventions <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> use to address boardroom issues. The findings highlight the need to better understand boardroom processes and the need of <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> to carefully manage relationships in and around the boardroom...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{compares the}} contribution, power and {{influence}} of <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> and part-time chairpersons within large UK PLC's, using interview data collected for a pilot study. Two questions are addressed: What contribution, if any, is made by <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> and part-time chairmen? How, if at all, do part-time chairpersons exercise {{power and influence}}? The paper reveals that part-time chairmen and <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> claim {{to contribute to a}} broad range of issues, ranging from the strategy of the firm, to the appointment, selection and dismissal of board members. Contribution is made by part-time chairmen and <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> converting power sources into influence. A variety of influence methods are used by part-time chairmen and <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> to contribute as board members. Part-time chairmen influence most by assertiveness, using the authority that comes with leading the board. <b>Non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> influence most through persuasion and coalition formation. <b>Non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> less on their positional authority to exert influence, and more on their personal knowledge, experience and expertise, as well as their ability to form relationships with individuals both inside and outside of the boardroom...|$|R

5|$|In the mid-2000s, Great Southern's {{business}} was growing rapidly, with sales and market capitalisation increasing {{at more than}} 100 per cent per annum. However, in its 2005 Annual Report, the company disclosed that it was subsidising the returns to its 1994 forestry scheme by approximately A$3 million, and that it expected to have to similarly subsidise the 1995 and 1996 schemes by up to A$12 million in future years. Board Chairman Peter Patrikeos and <b>non-executive</b> <b>director</b> Jeffry Mews both {{expressed concern about the}} way in which Great Southern was funding shortfalls on the sales of timber products, with the issue leading directly to Mews' resignation. Although the company continued to sell over A$800 million of MIS products in the two financial years after incurring losses on its early offerings, it was not meeting sales targets, and its share price was falling.|$|E
5|$|On 14 August 2006, it was {{confirmed}} that Randy Lerner, then {{owner of the}} National Football League's Cleveland Browns, had reached an agreement of £62.6million with Aston Villa for a takeover of the club.

In Ellis's last year in charge Villa lost £8.2m before tax, compared with a £3m profit the previous year, and income had fallen from £51.6m to £49m. Lerner took full control on 18 September, as he had 89.69% of the shares. On 19 September 2006, Ellis and his board resigned to be replaced with a new board headed by Lerner.

Cobbold also had a job offer for Smallpeice, an accountancy position within the Queen's Household, a position formally to be titled Administrative Adviser.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{globalisation}} and liberalisation of financial markets, changing societal expectations and corporate governance scandals {{have increased the}} attention for the fiduciary duties of <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors.</b> In this context, recent corporate governance reform initiatives have emphasised the control task and independence of <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors.</b> However, {{little attention has been}} paid to their impact on the external and internal service tasks of <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors.</b> Therefore, this paper investigates how the service tasks of <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> have evolved in the Netherlands. Data on corporate governance at the top- 100 listed companies in the Netherlands between 1997 and 2005 show that the emphasis on non-executive directors' external service task has shifted to their internal service task, i. e. from <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> acting as boundary spanners to <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> providing advice and counselling to executive directors. This shift in board responsibilities affects non-executive directors' ability to generate network benefits through board relationships and has implications for non-executive directors' functional requirements.

5|$|In 2005, Theo Paphitis {{announced}} that he was stepping down as chairman of the club with Jeff Burnige to replace him from May 2005. At the end of the 2004–05 season, manager Dennis Wise {{announced that}} he was leaving as he was unable to form a working relationship with the new chairman. Former Millwall striker Steve Claridge was announced as the new player-manager of Millwall. However, when Burnige then stepped down just two months after taking up the post, it was announced on 27 July that Claridge had been sacked after just 36 days, without ever taking charge of the team in a competitive match. Former Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Colin Lee replaced him but lasted only five months in charge of the club. On 21 December, with the club bottom of the Championship, he became the club's Director of Football and was replaced as manager by 32-year-old player Dave Tuttle, on a short-term contract {{until the end of the}} 2005–06 season. Tuttle had no prior experience in football management. In February 2006, Lee left the club altogether. Millwall experienced a difficult season, having had four managers in 2005. Their 13 goals scored at home was the second worst in Football League history. Their relegation to League One was confirmed on 17 April 2006 with a 2–0 loss against Southampton. In the closed season Nigel Spackman was appointed as the new manager, but he lasted only four months after a string of bad results. In September 2006, Theo Paphitis (chairman from 1997 to 2005) ended his nine-year association with the club after a year-long spell as a <b>non-executive</b> <b>director.</b> On 19 March 2007, Willie Donachie signed a two-year contract following some progress which had seen the club climb to 11th place in the league. Before Donachie took charge, Millwall had taken only six points from their first ten games. In the 2007–08 season Millwall sat bottom of the table at the beginning of October. Donachie was sacked on 8 October, with Richard Shaw and Colin West becoming caretaker managers.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (LLM (Mercantile Law)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The {{collapse}} of Enron, WorldCom {{and other companies}} and the worldwide adoption of codes of good corporate governance have highlighted the poor standard of corporate governance systems and brought about big changes in this field. Corporate scandals in Britain and South Africa have contributed to greater local awareness of the failings of traditional company governance. In the Anglo-Saxon system <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> are important watchdogs over powerful executive directors and other managers {{who are in a}} position to abuse their powers to the disadvantage of the shareholders. As independent supervisors <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> {{are in a position to}} protect the interests of shareholders and prevent the manipulation of power relationships by executive managers. Independent supervision is of the outmost importance to ensure effective corporate governance. It contributes to the objectivity of the decision-making process and also to the appointment of other efficient <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors.</b> Independence of <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> is influenced by the limited candidates in the pool from which they are appointed. This leads to a limited number of <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> serving on multiple boards of directors, which in turn compromises their independent supervision function. The promotion of diversity on company boards, can expand the “limited gene pool” of <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors.</b> The question arises whether black economic empowerment, as a mechanism to promote greater diversity, has in South Africa contributed to a wider gene pool from which <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors</b> are appointed? In this study it is concluded that, instead of widening the gene pool of <b>non-executive</b> <b>directors,</b> black economic empowerment is creating a second “gene pool” of black directors who serve on multiple boards and with potential implications for their independence...|$|R
