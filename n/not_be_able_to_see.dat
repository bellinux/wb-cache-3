5|$|Beetle {{antennae}} {{are primarily}} organs of sensory perception and can detect motion, odour and chemical substances, {{but may also}} be used to physically feel a beetle's environment. Beetle families may use antennae in different ways. For example, when moving quickly, tiger beetles may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> very well and instead hold their antennae rigidly in front of them in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{the optic}} nerve (II) affects {{specific}} aspects of vision that depend on {{the location of the}} lesion. A person may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> objects on their left or right sides (homonymous hemianopsia), or may have difficulty seeing objects on their outer visual fields (bitemporal hemianopsia) if the optic chiasm is involved. Vision may be tested by examining the visual field, or by examining the retina with an ophthalmoscope, using a process known as funduscopy. Visual field testing may be used to pin-point structural lesions in the optic nerve, or further along the visual pathways.|$|E
5|$|The minimum {{range of}} any radar system {{is due to}} its pulse width, {{the length of time}} that the {{transmitter}} is turned on before it turns off so the receiver can listen for reflections from targets. If the echo from the target is received while the transmitter is still sending, the echo will be swamped by the transmitted pulse backscattering off local sources. For instance, a radar with a pulse width of 1µs would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> returns from a target less than 150m away, because the radar signal travelling {{at the speed of light}} would cover the round trip distance of 300m before that 1µs interval had passed.|$|E

5|$|On 4 September, Mary Kom had {{its world}} premiere at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, where {{it became the}} first Hindi film to be {{screened}} on the opening night of the film festival. It was initially released to 1500 screens worldwide. The film was released in overseas markets by Eros International {{as part of a}} four-film deal between Eros and Viacom 18 studios. The rights to television broadcasting belonged to Viacom18's flagship general entertainment channel Colors. The film was not released in Kom's home state of Manipur because of the ban on Bollywood films by the Imphal-based separatist militant group, Revolutionary Peoples Front (RPF) since 2000. In an interview with Press Trust of India, Kom expressed her sadness that people from her own state would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her biopic. However, unauthorised DVDs and VCDs flooded the state, with the DVD format in great demand as the only option for native people to watch the film.|$|E
5|$|As the {{bombardment}} {{of the city}} proved to be unsuccessful, Montgomery then began to plan for an assault. Montgomery was to assault the Lower Town district, {{the part of the}} city near the river shore, while Arnold was to attack and take the Cape Diamond Bastion, a strong part of the city walls on the highest point of the rocky promontory. Montgomery believed that they should attack during a stormy night, therefore the British would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them. On December 27, the weather became stormy, and Montgomery ordered that the men prepare to attack. However, the storm soon subsided and Montgomery called off the attack. As Montgomery waited for a storm, he was forced to revise his plans, because a deserter communicated the original plan to the defenders. In the new plan, Montgomery would attack the Lower Town from the south and Arnold would attack the Lower Town from the north. After breaking through the walls, Montgomery and Arnold would meet up in the city and then attack and take the Upper Town, causing resistance to collapse. To increase their chance of surprise, Montgomery planned two feints. One detachment of troops (the 1st Canadian Regiment under James Livingston) would set fire to one of the gates while another (under the command of Jacob Brown) would engage the guard at Cape Diamond Bastion and fire rockets to signal the start of the attack. While the feints were conducted, artillery would fire into the city. Although Montgomery was reluctant to attack, enlistments for Arnold's men were expiring on January 1, and he was concerned about losing their services.|$|E
5|$|The safest way to {{view the}} Sun's disk is by {{indirect}} projection. This {{can be done by}} projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a video camera or digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible. Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path, one will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, however, depending on how much of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.|$|E

But when they were in distress and they searched for God with all their heart and soul, returned to God, and obeyed God, then they would find God, even there.

25|$|The lack of R18+ and X18+ {{ratings for}} games {{has been the}} subject of {{complaint}} in the gaming community, particularly on the basis that there is no reason why adults should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> content in games that they would see in a film. One of the main opponents to the introduction of a R18+ rating for video games was the former South Australian Attorney-General Michael Atkinson who has vetoed every attempt to induce one. Following his resignation after the 2010 South Australian elections there appears to be no likelihood of a future veto in the face of public opinion supporting the new classification. In August 2008, Australian video game show Good Game announced that a meeting of the Attorneys-General in March of that year resulted in a decision that the Australian public would be consulted before a final decision on the status of a R18+ rating for video games would be made.|$|E

25|$|The TV drama was {{suspended}} for four days from December 28, 2014 to January 1, 2015. Hunan Television said on its official Sina Weibo account that the TV drama will stop from Sunday on due to 'technical' reasons but {{will return to the}} screen on January 1, 2015. However, it was reported that the actual reason for this suspension was because the dresses were 'too exposing', especially in the chest region and the broadcasting authorities demanded the broadcaster edit the TV drama and then submit again for censorship. The show returned to screens on January 1, 2015, but with edited scenes that removed much of the shots of cleavage area. Wide shots and close-ups were heavily employed to minimize the amount of cleavage. Chinese Internet users responded by complaining about the censorship on Weibo. Several complained that they would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the hundreds of costume changes by Fan Bingbing.

25|$|New to Soulblighter {{were moving}} 3D models within the gaming world, {{something}} none of Bungie staff had ever created before. For example, the opening level features a fully functional windmill, and a later level features a drawbridge that closes as the level begins, {{and which the}} player must then lower so their army can gain access to a castle. Although the original game featured {{the same kind of}} 3D polygonal models, none of them moved, and implementing this feature proved {{to be one of the}} biggest challenges the team encountered in making the game. Another challenge also involved something not seen in the first game; a level set indoors. For this level, which is set in a large castle, the AI had to be rewritten as two enemy units could be right beside one another but <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> each other because of a wall between them. Previously, two units standing beside one another would automatically attack. Writing this new code into the AI scripting language proved especially difficult for the programmers.|$|E

Despite Raglan's [...] "lackadaisical wording", Lucan interpreted the order (correctly) to require him to place the Light Brigade {{at the mouth of the}} North Valley to Balaclava, a position that left the cavalry dangerously exposed: because of the terrain, they would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> advancing Russian troops until they were less than 50 feet away.

[...] are not exactly going to be affecting what's happening in New Orleans ... It's being aware of it and {{trying to find a way}} for it to be able to discuss in a way that makes sense." [...] He added in October that scheduling of each series factors into why crossovers between them are more difficult to pull off, and that network [...] "feelings" [...] need to be considered. He also spoke on why the television series do not show Avengers Tower as it appears in the films when they depict New York City, and stated that Marvel Television wanted to be [...] "less specific" [...] about the television characters' relationships to the tower because that [...] "helps the audience understand that this could be on any street corner" [...] and that the characters could be in an area of the city where you would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the tower, even though it exists.|$|E
500|$|The titular [...] "Evolve" [...] game {{mechanic}} {{was inspired}} by the [...] "bomb planting" [...] mode from the Counter-Strike series. The Monsters started out as a relatively weak creature that could be defeated easily, but becomes stronger and gains more skills as it evolves. Early playtesters complained about the game mechanic, as they thought that this would bring an unfair disadvantage to the Hunters, since they do not [...] "evolve" [...] like the Monster. However, the design team still chose to maintain the game mechanic, as they thought that it would create an engaging experience. Ashton added that such game mechanics can create a [...] "turning the tables" [...] feeling for the Hunters, and that he thought that the sudden change in strategy – from offensive to defensive – could help deliver a dynamic experience to the players. The Monster was originally intended to play from a first-person perspective but was later shifted to a third-person perspective during development because the first-person control system was considered to be clumsy and confusing, and that the first person perspective took control away from players. The design team considered designing third-person gameplay a challenge, as they had no prior experience in creating such games. On the other hand, the design team implemented the first-person gameplay for the Hunters when Evolves development started. The design team thought that the first-person perspective would provide a sense of tension as players would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what was behind them.|$|E
