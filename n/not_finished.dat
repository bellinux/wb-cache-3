5|$|A final wave of war {{cemetery}} memorials {{were completed}} in the 1930s under the Fascist governments of Germany and Italy. The main Italian war cemeteries were <b>not</b> <b>finished</b> until 1938, and their positioning in some cases carried special political meaning, emphasising Italy's right to claim important, but ethnically diverse, border regions. In Germany, the same decade saw the completion of totenburgen, fortresses of the dead, used as war cemeteries and memorials. These were in some senses {{an extension of the}} cemetery designs of the 1920s, celebrating a natural German landscape, but included extensive modernist, monumental features, intending to highlight German artistic skill.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Caltrans {{said that}} SR54 {{had not been}} {{included}} in plans {{for the next six}} years, {{due to a lack of}} funding and a shift in priorities from new roads to maintenance. The water subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives later recommended that the wildlife refuge be put on hold, since the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) had <b>not</b> <b>finished</b> their proposal. Over the next few years, support for the project was expressed by a local citizens' group, the Chula Vista city council, and the San Diego Chamber of Commerce.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} {{statement}} {{he said he}} had handed the report to Rudolf Kastner on 26 April 1944 during the latter's visit to Bratislava, but Bauer writes that the report was <b>not</b> <b>finished</b> until 27 April. In another statement, Krasniansky said he had passed it to Kastner on 28 April in Bratislava, but Hansi Brand, Kastner's lover and the wife of Joel Brand, said that Kastner was not in Bratislava until August. It is clear from Kastner's post-war statements that he did have early access to the report, Bauer writes, but perhaps not in April. According to Randolph L. Braham, Kastner had a copy by 3 May, when he paid a visit to Kolozsvár (Cluj), his home town.|$|E

5|$|Many {{associations}} between adult oviraptorosaur skeletons or embryos with elongatoolithid eggs (including Macroolithus) demonstrate that Macroolithus and other elongatoolithids were laid by oviraptorosaurs. One oviraptorosaur skeleton from the Upper Cretaceous of China {{was described in}} 2005; two shelled elongatoolithid eggs were preserved inside of its pelvis. This suggests that oviraptorosaurs had two functional oviducts where both would produce eggs simultaneously. While Sato et al. did not refer the eggs specifically to Macroolithus, they noted that the eggs closely resemble M. yaotunensis, though with a thinner eggshell. The thin eggshell, however, could simply be because the shell had <b>not</b> <b>finished</b> forming when the mother died, or because of biochemical dissolution of the shell before fossilization.|$|E
5|$|Matejko {{began work}} on the {{painting}} {{in the middle of}} January 1891, to coincide with the centenary of the Constitution. Although the painting was <b>not</b> <b>finished</b> until October, by May 3 it was sufficiently advanced to be shown at the anniversary exhibition in Sukiennice, Kraków. On April 7, 1892, Matejko transferred the painting to Prince Eustachy Stanisław Sanguszko, marshal of Galician Sejm in Lwów, and it was displayed in the Sejm building (now the main building of the Lviv University). This painting {{was one of the last}} works by Matejko, who died in November 1893.|$|E

5|$|Progress on {{the section}} from Paddington to Queen's Park was slowed by {{the start of}} World War I, so the line was <b>not</b> <b>finished</b> until early 1915. As at Paddington, the three below-ground {{stations}} were built to use escalators. Maida Vale and Kilburn Park were provided with buildings {{in the style of the}} earlier Leslie Green stations but without the upper storey, which was no longer required for housing lift gear. Warwick Avenue was accessed from a subway under the street. The LNWR rebuilt Queen's Park station with additional platforms for the Bakerloo Tube's and its own electric services and constructed two train sheds for rolling stock, one each side of the station.|$|E

In addition, remnants of Tiberius' villa at Sperlonga, which includes a grotto where the important Sperlonga sculptures were found in fragments, and the Villa Jovis on top of Capri have been preserved. The estate at Capri is said by Tacitus to have included a total of twelve villas across the island, of which Villa Jovis was the largest.|$|E

5|$|When {{the first}} traffic flowed, crews had <b>not</b> <b>finished</b> some final tasks, such as {{painting}} stripes. Motorists saw a relocation with several mountain cuts built high up the canyon wall, {{with a view}} of the slide and former lake. The roadbed was not expected to last, as weather conditions had been unfavorable when the asphalt was laid. Two mountain cuts were unstable, requiring several months of work before they could be left unattended. During this time, the state stationed two full-time watches at the cuts, who would close the road while falling rocks were cleared. The cut through Billies Mountain was described by the construction crews as a new, man-made mountain pass.|$|E
5|$|When the {{new airport}} opened on 8 October 1998 the Flytoget airport express trains started {{operating}} immediately, as did the Gardermoen Line from Lillestrøm {{to the airport and}} onwards to Eidsvoll. Because the tunnel was <b>not</b> <b>finished,</b> trains were required to use the old Trunk Line from Oslo Central Station to Lillestrøm. After this diversion the express trains switched to the completed section of the new Gardermoen Line between Lillestrøm and Oslo Airport. Regular operations using the Romerike Tunnel started on 22 August 1999.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a captive}} from Barcoor, {{pregnant}} women often gave birth en route, and their babies {{had to be}} borne bundled about them. When they rested, the infants were suspended in cradles from the branches of trees. If anyone happened to die they were buried on the spot. Captives were not given any rations, and {{when the time came}} to move on, those who had <b>not</b> <b>finished</b> cooking had to leave behind their rice and the cooking pots. The Barcoor Manuscript along with other British Government records suggest that 20,000 captives (one-third of the total) died on the march to Seringapatam due to hunger, disease, and ill treatment by soldiers. The journey to Seringapatam took six weeks. By 1787, some 30,000 captives, half the original number, had perished.|$|E

5|$|After {{showing the}} game at the Macworld Expo, Bungie was mobbed with {{interest}} and orders for the game. The game was <b>not</b> <b>finished</b> until December 14, 1994; Jones {{and a few other}} employees spent a day at a warehouse assembling boxes so that some of the orders could be filled before Christmas. The game was a critical and commercial success, and is regarded as a relatively unknown but important part of gaming history. It served as the Mac alternative to DOS PC-only games like Doom and System Shock. The game's volume of orders was unprecedented for the studio, who found that its old method of mail or phone orders could not scale to the demand and hired another company to handle {{the tens of thousands of}} orders. Marathon also brought Bungie attention from press outside the small Mac gaming market.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the second day, June 23, the Committee on Permanent Organization {{announced}} the roster of officers, including the permanent president, John W. Stevenson of Kentucky. Before the delegates could formally elect Stevenson, they heard the report on the Committee on Credentials. Two rival factions of Massachusetts Democrats had agreed to compromise, both being admitted as a united delegation. A similar dispute in New York was not resolved so easily: Tammany Hall and Tilden's Irving Hall had sent rival delegations as well, and neither was willing to compromise. The Committee had voted to consider the Irving Hall Democrats to have been regularly elected; Tammany was consequently excluded. Debate followed, in which some delegates urged compromise, with the idea that a united delegation would help unite the party in New York in the coming general election. The argument was unpersuasive, as the delegates endorsed the Committee's decision by a vote of 457 to 205½; Tammany was banished. Stevenson was then installed as permanent chairman and, as the Committee on Resolutions had <b>not</b> <b>finished</b> writing the platform, the delegates moved on to nominations.|$|E
5|$|Dark Gaia then attacks Sonic and Chip, but Chip protects Sonic {{and calls}} {{all of the}} Gaia temples {{together}} to form the Gaia Colossus and fight Dark Gaia.

Chip then gives the restored Chaos Emeralds to Sonic, allowing him to turn into Super Sonic and destroy it; Dark Gaia then sinks back into the planet, but the battle takes its toll on Super Sonic. Chip saves Sonic by throwing him to the surface, before returning himself {{to the inside of}} the planet; he leaves behind his necklace and some parting words. Sonic places the necklace on his hand as a bracelet to remind him of their adventure together before speeding off with Tails, flying alongside him on the coastline in the Tornado plane.|$|E
