5|$|A <b>new</b> <b>federal</b> {{city was}} then {{constructed}} {{on the north}} bank of the Potomac, {{to the east of}} Georgetown. On September 9, 1791, the three commissioners overseeing the capital's construction named the city in honor of President Washington. The federal district was named Columbia, which was a poetic name for the United States commonly in use at that time. Congress held its first session in Washington on November 17, 1800.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} loss of their land, local {{residents}} discovered that they had been disenfranchised. Now a part of the ACT, they had lost their vote in the New South Wales government, and their numbers were too small to warrant a seat in the <b>new</b> <b>federal</b> parliament. As a result, they had no representation in parliament through which to argue against the provisions of the legislation.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{ratification}} of the United States Constitution {{by the state of}} New York in 1788, the delegates agreed to keep New York City as the temporary federal capital. In 1790, Congress passed the Residence Act, which created the District of Columbia, located {{on the banks of the}} Potomac River from land belonging until that time to the states of Maryland and Virginia, to serve as the <b>new</b> <b>federal</b> capital.|$|E
5|$|In his Federalist No. 43, {{published}} January 23, 1788, James Madison {{argued that}} the <b>new</b> <b>federal</b> government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety.

Known as the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, the event emphasized {{the need for the}} national government not to rely on any state for its own security.|$|E

5|$|Article One, Section Eight, of the United States Constitution granted Congress the {{authority}} to create a federal district {{to serve as the}} national capital. Following the ratification of the Constitution, the Congress, while meeting in New York, passed the Residence Act on July 9, 1790. The Act established the District of Columbia {{on the banks of the}} Potomac River between the states of Maryland and Virginia to serve as the <b>new</b> <b>federal</b> capital. However, Robert Morris, a Senator from Pennsylvania, convinced Congress to return to Philadelphia while the new permanent capital was being built. As a result, the Residence Act also declared Philadelphia to be the temporary capital for a period of ten years.|$|E
5|$|For the {{constitution}} to be ratified, however, nine of the thirteen states were required to approve it in state conventions. Opposition to ratification ("Anti-Federalism") was partly based on the Constitution's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for {{the addition of a}} bill of rights. Four state conventions proposed some form of restriction on the authority of the <b>new</b> <b>federal</b> government to conduct searches.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Fisher {{was elected}} to the <b>new</b> <b>federal</b> {{parliament}} representing the Division of Wide Bay. He served as Minister for Trade and Customs for a few months in 1904, in the short-lived government of Chris Watson. Fisher was elected deputy leader of the Labor Party in 1905, and replaced Watson as leader in 1907. At the time, Labor supported the Protectionist Party minority government of Alfred Deakin. Deakin resigned as prime minister in November 1908 after Labor withdrew their support, and Fisher subsequently formed a minority government of his own. It lasted only a few months, as in June 1909 Deakin returned as prime minister {{at the head of the}} new Commonwealth Liberal Party (a merger of the Protectionists and the Anti-Socialist Party).|$|E

5|$|In September 1811, William Henry Harrison, then {{governor}} of Indiana Territory, visited Kentucky and directed Colonel Samuel Wells to recruit Kentuckians for a <b>new</b> <b>federal</b> regiment then being {{formed by the}} authority of Secretary of War William Eustis. Harrison had not applied to Scott for permission to recruit in the state, and many Kentuckians– from Scott's political enemy, Humphrey Marshall, to his trusted advisor, Jesse Bledsoe– perceived this as a slight to the governor. Ignoring Bledsoe's indignation, Scott refused to make an issue of the faux pas and instead {{became one of the}} staunchest supporters of Harrison's rising career.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the convention, Mason {{supported}} much of the Virginia Plan, which was introduced by Randolph on May 29. This plan would have a popularly elected lower house which would choose the members of the upper house from lists provided by the states. Most of the delegates had found the weak government under the Articles insufficient, and Randolph proposed that the <b>new</b> <b>federal</b> government should be supreme over the states. Mason agreed that the federal government should be more powerful than the states.|$|E
5|$|Other {{important}} legislation involved {{two measures}} to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a <b>new</b> <b>Federal</b> income tax. In 1861, Lincoln signed {{the second and}} third Morrill Tariff, the first having become law under James Buchanan. Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of 1861, creating the first U.S. income tax. This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($ in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the Revenue Act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure.|$|E

5|$|The Commonwealth of Australia {{came into}} {{existence}} on 1 January 1901 {{as a result of}} the federation of the Australian colonies. Under the Constitution of Australia, defence responsibility was now vested in the <b>new</b> <b>federal</b> government. The co-ordination of Australia-wide defensive efforts in the face of Imperial German interest in the Pacific Ocean was one of driving forces behind federalism, and the Department of Defence immediately came into being as a result, while the Commonwealth Military Forces (early forerunner of the Australian Army) and Commonwealth Naval Force were also soon established.|$|E
5|$|The {{events in}} Winnipeg {{highlighted}} the chaotic and ill-coordinated management of security issues across Canada, the artificial division between policing organisations {{in the west}} and east of the country, and the absence of a single senior leader for security work. Commissioner Perry recommended creating a <b>new</b> <b>federal</b> police force, ideally by amalgamating the Dominion Police into the existing mounted police force. The mounted police, he argued, were much larger, militarized, experienced and had a proven capacity to carry out secret intelligence work. They were also free from union influence and enjoyed high prestige among the public.|$|E
5|$|Though Rutherford {{supported}} Haultain's {{vision of}} non-partisan territorial administration, federally {{he was an}} avowed Liberal. In 1900, he {{was elected president of}} the Strathcona Liberal association, and was a delegate to the convention that nominated Oliver as the party's candidate in Alberta for the 1900 federal election. He subsequently campaigned for Oliver in his successful re-election attempt. When the <b>new</b> <b>federal</b> constituency of Strathcona was formed in advance of the 1904 election, Rutherford was urged to accept the Liberal nomination, but demurred. Peter Talbot was selected instead and, supported by Rutherford, was elected.|$|E
