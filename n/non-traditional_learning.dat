Significant differences between traditional students (defined as having entered higher education for the first time and under the age of 24) and non-traditional students (defined as those 24 and over who are searching for meaning and relevance connected to their working life and job experience and therefore pursuing higher education), were identified on 13 of the 16 combined MSLQ and ILS scales. On the Rehearsal scale, the traditional students score significant higher than non-traditional students. Non-traditional students performed better on 12 of the 16 scales. Non-traditional students were also found to be more able to regulate their learning than traditional students in the areas of cognition, motivation, behavior and context.

50|$|In {{addition}} to college prep and Advanced Placement (AP) courses, EDS employs other special programs in their curriculum. Most years, Upper School students are taken on <b>non-traditional</b> <b>learning</b> experiences during Intersession. Intersession expands the classrooms to {{include not only}} the Tri-State area but {{to the rest of}} the country and world. In the past, a few activities for the week-long affair have included Habitat for Humanity, backpacking in the Smokey Mountains, and college tours all over the county. Other national and international trips have taken Day Students to Washington D.C., Chicago, Costa Rica, Rome, and Hong Kong. Along with Intersession, Senior Projects is considered a unique experience, taking place in the very end of each senior year. Students venture into the community for a two-week immersion into one or more fields. This ideally takes place with a business, institution, school, social, or health facility that is associated with a potential college major or possible career choice.|$|E
50|$|A {{great part}} of LACS’ {{approach}} to <b>non-traditional</b> <b>learning</b> is the two annual away from school trips that the entire school attends. Students, faculty, and staff join together in two yearly special retreats. These out of school events are used to help students learn and connect with each other outside of the traditional classroom setting. In the fall, the entire school takes a two-day retreat to a nearby campground. Here {{students are encouraged to}} explore the grounds and engage in different activities all while creating relationships outside of the classroom with each other as well as faculty and staff. In the spring, students choose from among several possible weeklong away or local trips. Some trips go hiking, canoeing, bicycling, or fishing. Local trips often take days during the week to visit nearby museums or film videos about the community. “Trips week” was created to give students the opportunity to challenge themselves and work within a group in a non-school environment. Two of the most popular week longs trips happen to be community service trips. One annual away trip visits the Akwesasne Native American reservation while the other trip travels to New Orleans to engage in Hurricane Katrina clean up and restoration. Students who are involved in these annual trips spend the whole year in a Family Group together fundraising for their spring trip. Language students have the option of joining a Family Group that spends the year fundraising for a weeklong trip to a French- or Spanish-speaking country.|$|E

In 1970, {{he was invited to}} become Wedemeyer’s research assistant and was immediately involved in activism for <b>non-traditional</b> <b>learning</b> as he assisted Wedemeyer in a campaign to establish a state-wide open educational system 7, as well as in international work through Wedemeyer’s presidency of the International Council for Correspondence Education. Some of his other activities included participation in studies on the first use of satellites for intercultural adult education, and assisting in teaching a seminar on independent study. Over an intensive three-year association, Moore and Wedemeyer shared ideas on the emerging field; including what Wedemeyer 6 had been referring to as Independent Study. In 1973, Moore received his PhD from the University of Wisconsin and then continued his commitment to education in developing countries by taking a teaching post at St. Francis Xavier University and its Coady International Institute in Antigonish, Canada. While there, he and Wedemeyer corresponded and shared updates on each other’s work, including ideas about radio and satellite communication in education. Between 1977 and 1986, Moore was Senior Counselor at the Open University of the United Kingdom and, for a period, a member of the Education Studies Faculty.|$|E

50|$|The flex {{model is}} a method of {{teaching}} {{for students who are}} <b>non-traditional</b> learners. <b>Learning</b> material and instructions are given online and the lessons are self-guided. The teacher is available on-site. The students work independently and learn to develop and create new concepts in a digital environment. They work in computer labs most of the time. The schedules of learning modalities are customized individually and the teacher-of-record is on-site. Though most of the instructions are given online, the face-to-face support as needed by the student is given by the teacher-of-records and adults through activities such as group projects, small group instruction and individual tutoring. This model provides the students a flexible learning environment. They are free to arrive and leave the learning premises within the given timing of the day. The teacher in this model acts as a mentor and give equal importance in delivering the proper instruction to the students.|$|R

There is a range of programs that the school provides Year 7 students with to participate in ranging from a camp in the first week, to great leadership opportunities and student wellbeing programs. A particular focus is placed on positive education combined with academic excellence. An extensive transition program has been implemented to assist students as they move into secondary education. There is also lots of opportunities for Year Eights such as becoming members of the Student Representative Council [...] There are pastoral care sessions to ensure Year Eights are getting the most of their schooling. In Year Nine, students are able to select from a broad range of electives. This provides students with a great range of choice and responsibility. The program goes {{over the course of a}} year and allows the students to work in a range of situations in different groups and individually. The objectives of the program are to provide students with good life skills and to have student centered learning. Even though students in 9 Life are in a <b>non-traditional</b> <b>learning</b> environment, they still study structured core subjects such as Mathematics and English.
