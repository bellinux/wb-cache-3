50|$|The <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Current (sometimes {{referred}} to as the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Drift) is a slow warm water current that flows west-to-east between 30 and 50 degrees <b>north</b> in the <b>Pacific</b> Ocean. The current forms {{the southern part of the}} <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Subpolar Gyre and the northern part of the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Subtropical Gyre. The <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Current is formed by the collision of the Kuroshio Current, running northward off the coast of Japan, and the Oyashio Current, which is a cold subarctic current that flows south and circulates counterclockwise along the western <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean. In the eastern <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> off southern British Columbia, it splits into the southward flowing California Current and the northward flowing Alaska Current.|$|R

50|$|<b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> {{currently}} produces 4 models. The <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> 43 Pilothouse is a stout fiberglass trawler {{built on}} the original CHB 38 hull. The 43 Pilothouse cruises at 8- 10 knots produced by the yacht's 230 hp Cummins diesel, with twin engines available. Based largely {{on the success of}} the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> 43 and the need for a smaller, more affordable pilothouse <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Yachts decided to produce the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> 39 Pilothouse. Starting in the Spring of 2009 a new <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> 38 will be available with a single or optional two stateroom layout. The <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> 38 Sedan is based on the same proven hull as the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> 43. The 38 ft. Sedan has the classic look of a traditional trawler with walk-around decks. They have recently added the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> 28 Pilothouse trailerable pocket trawler with an 8.5 ft. beam, suitable for transportation to and from the water by their owners without a permit. The design for their new 28 footer came from Chesapeake Marine Design and was created by Karl Stambaugh. The design fit in well with the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> fleet as well as with a growing demand for this type of boat and this particular design. <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Yachts worked with Karl who modified the hull, adding stability and speed to the existing design. After months of planning and several minor design changes mold production began. The first <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> 28 is scheduled for delivery in August 2009.|$|R

Significant seasonal cycles were found in 5 regions: 1) The western <b>North</b> <b>Pacific,</b> 2) The northeastern <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> and Alaska gyre, 3) the in-tertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), 4) an area of the central <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>north</b> of the Hawaiian Islands, 5) the central South Pacific along 10 – 20 ◦ S.

50|$|The <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> {{subtropical}} gyre {{along with}} the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> subpolar gyre make up the two major gyre systems in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Pacific Ocean. This two-gyre circulation in the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> {{is driven by the}} trade and westerly winds. This {{is one of the best}} examples of all of Earth’s oceans where these winds drive a two-gyre circulation. Physical characteristics like weak thermohaline circulation in the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> and it being mostly blocked by land in the north, also help facilitate this circulation. As depth increases, these gyres in the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> grow smaller and weaker, and the high pressure at the center of subtropical gyre will migrate poleward and westward.|$|R

In the eastern subtropical <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> between 200 and 400 m the tritium signature suggests that the water is of subpolar origin during non-El Niño years. During El Niño years, the water at this location is devoid of tritium. We hypothesize that the El Niño phenomenon alters both the ventilation of thermocline and intermediate waters in the eastern subpolar <b>North</b> <b>Pacific,</b> {{as well as the}} transport of this water to the eastern subtropical gyre.

40|$|Abstract-A {{cross-section}} of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> was obtained along 3 O”N in 1994. Distributions of water column inventories of CFCs in the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> were estimated by interpolating observed concentrations of CFCs {{to all the}} <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> based on salinity and water temperature. Total amounts of CFC- 11 and CFC- 12 in the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> were estimated to be 7. 92 f 1. 17 (x lo 7 moles) and 4. 55 + 0. 73 (x IO 7 moles), respectively. By introducing the CFCs data into a four-box model for the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific,</b> relations between an exchange coefficient of CFC and a production rate of intermediate water in the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> were estimated.

40|$|The climate {{variability}} in the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> is re-investigated by using the latest Hadley Centre SST analysis covering the period 1870 - 1998 and other observational datasets. The main result {{of this study is}} that the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> decadal and multi-decadal variability on time scales from 10 - 50 years evolves independently of the variations in the tropical Pacific, so that this kind of variability must be regarded as internal to the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific.</b> The origin of the decadal and interdecadal variability observed in the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> region is still a matter of intense scientific debate. On the one hand, Trenberth and Hurrell 1994, Graham 1994, Zhang et al. 1997 and Gu and Philander 1997, for instance, argue that the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> decadal variability is forced by variations in the tropical Pacific through atmospheric telecon...|$|R

50|$|The Kuroshio Current is the narrow, strong westward {{boundary}} {{current of}} the subtropical circulation. This current influences {{the water column}} {{all the way to}} the bottom. The Kuroshio current flows in a northerly direction, then eventually flows further from the westward boundary where it then takes an eastward direction into the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific.</b> This eastward flowing current is then called the Kuroshio Extension. The <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Current is located just north of the subtropical gyre and flows in an easterly direction. Also, known as the West Wind Drift or the Subarctic Current, the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Current also includes the westward flow of the southern boundary of the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> subpolar gyre. The North Equatorial Current borders the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> subtropical gyre on the south and flows in a westerly direction. The westward flow within the elongated tropical cyclonic circulation is also included in the North Equatorial current. The California Current System comprises the eastern boundary of the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> subtropical gyre and flows south along the coast of California. Here coastal upwelling drives the eastern boundary current and an undercurrent that flows poleward.|$|R

40|$|Summary: Seasonal {{prediction}} {{skill of}} <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> SST anomalies and the PDO in the NCEP CFS v 1 hindcasts is assessed. The central <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> SST experiences a faster drop in prediction skill for forecasts initialized from Nov to Feb {{than those from}} May to Aug, a similar feature to the “spring barrier ” in the ENSO forecasts. Seasonal prediction skill in the central <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> mainly results from skillful prediction of ENSO via the atmosphere bridge. The PDO is more (less) skillful than the persistence at all lead time during ENSO (neutral) years. Results suggest that improvement of ENSO prediction and reduction in model biases near the western boundary will improve the PDO and <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> SST predictions.
