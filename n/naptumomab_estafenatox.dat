40|$|Traditionally, {{the major}} {{objective}} in phase I trials {{is to identify}} a working-dose for subsequent studies, whereas the major endpoint in phase II and III trials is treatment efficacy. The dose sought is typically {{referred to as the}} maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Several statistical methodologies have been proposed to select the MTD in cancer phase I trials. In this manuscript, we focus on a Bayesian adaptive design, known as escalation with overdose control (EWOC). Several aspects of this design are discussed, including large sample properties of the sequence of doses selected in the trial, choice of prior distributions, and use of covariates. The methodology is exemplified with real-life examples of cancer phase I trials. In particular, we show in the recently completed ABR- 217620 (<b>naptumomab</b> <b>estafenatox)</b> trial that omitting an important predictor of toxicity when dose assignments to cancer patients are determined results in a high percent of patients experiencing severe side effects and a significant proportion treated at sub-optimal doses.

40|$|This {{overview}} of 25 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and five Fc fusion protein therapeutics provides brief {{descriptions of the}} candidates, recently published clinical study results and on-going Phase 3 studies. In alphanumeric order, the 2011 therapeutic antibodies to watch list comprises AIN- 457, bapineuzumab, brentuximab vedotin, briakinumab, dalotuzumab, epratuzumab, farletuzumab, girentuximab (WX-G 250), <b>naptumomab</b> <b>estafenatox,</b> necitumumab, obinutuzumab, otelixizumab, pagibaximab, pertuzumab, ramucirumab, REGN 88, reslizumab, solanezumab, T 1 h, teplizumab, trastuzumab emtansine, tremelimumab, vedolizumab, zalutumumab and zanolimumab. In alphanumeric order, the 2011 Fc fusion protein therapeutics to watch list comprises aflibercept, AMG- 386, atacicept, Factor VIII-Fc and Factor IX-Fc. Commercially-sponsored mAb and Fc fusion therapeutics that have progressed {{only as far as}} Phase 2 / 3 or 3 were included. Candidates undergoing regulatory review or products that have been approved may also be in Phase 3 studies, but these were excluded. Due to the large body of primary literature about the candidates, only selected references are given and results from recent publications and articles that were relevant to Phase 3 studies are emphasized. Current as of September 2010, the information presented here will serve as a baseline against which future progress in the development of antibody-based therapeutics can be measured...|$|E
40|$|The T {{lymphocytes}} are {{the most}} important effector cells in immunotherapy of cancer. The conceptual objective for developing the tumor targeted superantigen (TTS) ABR- 217620 (<b>naptumomab</b> <b>estafenatox,</b> 5 T 4 Fab-SEA/E- 120), now in phase 3 studies for advanced renal cell cancer, was to selectively coat tumor cells with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) target structures functionally similar to natural CTL pMHC target molecules. Here we present data showing that the molecular basis for the anti-tumor activity by ABR- 217620 resides in the distinct interaction between the T cell receptor β variable (TRBV) 7 - 9 and the engineered superantigen (Sag) SEA/E- 120 in the fusion protein bound to the 5 T 4 antigen on tumor cells. Multimeric but not monomeric ABR- 217620 selectively stains TRBV 7 - 9 expressing T lymphocytes from human peripheral blood similar to antigen specific staining of T cells with pMHC tetramers. SEA/E- 120 selectively activates TRBV 7 - 9 expressing T lymphocytes resulting in expansion of the subset. ABR- 217620 selectively triggers TRBV 7 - 9 expressing cytotoxic T lymphocytes to kill 5 T 4 positive tumor cells. Furthermore, ABR- 217620 activates TRBV 7 - 9 expressing T cell line cells in the presence of cell- and bead-bound 5 T 4 tumor antigen. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that ABR- 217620 binds to 5 T 4 with high affinity, to TRBV 7 - 9 with low affinity and to MHC class II with very low affinity. The T lymphocyte engagement by ABR- 217620 is constituted by displaying high affinity binding to the tumor cells (KD approximately 1 nM) and with the mimicry o...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To prospectively {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} <b>naptumomab</b> <b>estafenatox</b> (Nap) + IFNα versus IFN in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Experimental Design: In a randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase II/III study, 513 patients with RCC received Nap (15 μg/kg i. v. in three cycles of four once-daily injections) + IFN (9 MU s. c. three times weekly), or the same regimen of IFN monotherapy. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Results: This phase II/III study did not meet its primary endpoint. Median OS/PFS for Nap + IFN patients was 17. 1 / 5. 8 months versus 17. 5 / 5. 8 months for the patients receiving IFN alone (P = 0. 56; HR, 1. 08 /P = 0. 41; HR, 0. 92). Post hoc exploratory subgroup and trend analysis revealed that the baseline plasma concentrations of anti-SEA/E- 120 (anti-Nap antibodies) for drug exposure and IL 6 for immune status {{could be used as}} predictive biomarkers. A subgroup of patients (SG; n = 130) having concentrations below median of anti-SEA/E- 120 and IL 6 benefitted greatly from the addition of Nap. In SG, median OS/PFS for the patients treated with Nap + IFN was 63. 3 / 13. 7 months versus 31. 1 / 5. 8 months for the patients receiving IFN alone (P = 0. 02; HR, 0. 59 /P = 0. 02; HR, 0. 62). Addition of Nap to IFN showed predicted and transient immune related AEs and the treatment had an acceptable safety profile. Conclusions: The study did not meet its primary endpoint. Nap + IFN has an acceptable safety profile, and results from post hoc subgroup analyses showed that the treatment might improve OS/PFS in a baseline biomarker-defined RCC patient subgroup. The results warrant further studies with Nap in this subgroup...|$|E
