40|$|Abstract—Traditional {{contacting}} measurement has numerous disadvantages, including high cost, high damage rate, low mobility, etc. In this study, {{to resolve}} these serious problems, a simple, broadband <b>non-contacting</b> loop {{has been designed to}} transmit and receive a signal. An equivalent dual-port <b>non-contacting</b> measurement model and a method of vertical coupling capacitance and inductance have been proposed. From the results of the dual-port model simulation and the fabricated sample measurement, a method of signal reconstruction and novel <b>non-contacting</b> measurement is presented. 1...|$|R

5|$|There {{are several}} <b>non-contact</b> {{variants}} of American football, such as flag football. In flag football the ballcarrier is not tackled; instead, defenders aim {{to pull a}} flag tied around his waist. Another variant, touch football, simply requires the ballcarrier to be touched to be considered downed. A game of touch football may require that the player be touched with either one or two hands to be considered down, depending on the rules used.|$|E
5|$|Women's lacrosse, a <b>non-contact</b> {{version of}} the sport {{originating}} in Scotland during the 1890s, is played by twelve players per side, on longer fields and with less protective equipment than the men's game requires. In the 1930s Canadian businessmen established a version called box lacrosse to create business for ice hockey arenas during the summer months. Box lacrosse is played indoors, with smaller nets, between two teams of six players, and strongly resembles the game its areas were designed for.|$|E
5|$|Because American {{football}} is a full-contact sport, head injuries are relatively common. According to the San Francisco Spine Institute at Seton Medical Center in Daly City, California, up to 1.5 million young men participate in football annually, {{and there are}} an estimated 1.2 million football-related injuries per year. An estimated 51% of injuries occur during training sessions, while 49% occur elsewhere. Injuries are nearly 5 times more likely to happen during contact training sessions than in controlled, <b>non-contact</b> sessions. Older players are at the most risk for injuries, while teams with experienced coaches and more assistant coaches are less likely to experience injuries. Fifty percent of injuries occur in the lower extremities (with knee injuries alone counting for roughly 36% of all injuries) and 30% occur in the upper extremities.|$|E

5|$|On April 2, the Bears began a {{voluntary}} offseason program, {{and because they}} had a new head coach, the Bears were given a two-week earlier start than teams that did not hire a new head coach. For {{the first two weeks of}} the program, the only activities allowed were strength and conditioning and rehabilitation, and only strength and conditioning coaches are allowed to be on the field with the players. On the third week, {{a voluntary}} minicamp was held, and all coaches were permitted to work. From April 16–18, the Bears held two-hour <b>non-contact</b> drills, and held ten organized team activities (OTAs) during May 13 – June 6, followed by a mandatory minicamp from June 11–13.|$|E
5|$|A {{scoring system}} to {{evaluate}} material {{is to add}} up the piece values of the material on the board. In chess, when a pawn equals one unit, a bishop or knight is worth three, a rook five and a queen nine. These values are {{a consequence of the}} difference in mobility of the pieces. In bughouse, piece values differ because pieces in reserve essentially have the same mobility as they can be dropped on any vacant square. The pawn relatively gains importance in bughouse chess, as its very limited mobility does not handicap reserve pawns. They can for instance be dropped to block <b>non-contact</b> checks. Pawns can be dropped onto the seventh rank, one step away from promotion, which again adds to their importance. Long-range pieces like the queen or the rook lose relative value, due to the constantly changing pawn structure. They {{are also more likely to}} be hemmed in. A valuation system, first suggested by FICS-player Gnejs, often applied to bughouse is pawn=1, bishop=knight=rook=2 and queen=4.|$|E
