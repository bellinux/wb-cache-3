50|$|The seller {{pays for}} the {{carriage}} of the goods up to the <b>named</b> <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination.</b> Risk transfers to buyer when the goods have been loaded on board the ship {{in the country of}} Export. The Shipper is responsible for origin costs including export clearance and freight costs for carriage to named port. The shipper is not responsible for delivery to the final destination from the port (generally the buyer's facilities), or for buying insurance. If the buyer does require the seller to obtain insurance, the Incoterm CIF should be considered. CFR should only be used for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CPT.|$|E

50|$|Where {{goods are}} {{delivered}} ex ship, {{the passing of}} risk does not occur until the ship has arrived at the <b>named</b> <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> and the goods made available for unloading to the buyer. The seller pays the same freight and insurance costs as he would under a CIF arrangement. Unlike CFR and CIF terms, the seller has agreed to bear not just cost, but also Risk and Title up {{to the arrival of}} the vessel at the named port. Costs for unloading the goods and any duties, taxes, etc. are for the Buyer. A commonly used term in shipping bulk commodities, such as coal, grain, dry chemicals; and where the seller either owns or has chartered their own vessel.|$|E
50|$|This term is broadly {{similar to}} the above CFR term, with the {{exception}} that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit to the <b>named</b> <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination.</b> CIF requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of their value under at least the minimum cover of the Institute Cargo Clauses of the Institute of London Underwriters (which would be Institute Cargo Clauses (C)), or any similar set of clauses. The policy {{should be in the}} same currency as the contract. The seller must also turn over documents necessary, to obtain the goods from the carrier or to assert claim against an insurer to the buyer. The documents include (as a minimum) the invoice, the insurance policy, and the bill of lading. These three documents represent the cost, insurance, and freight of CIF. The seller's obligation ends when the documents are handed over to the buyer. Then, the buyer has to pay at the agreed price. Another point to consider is that CIF should only be used for non-containerized seafreight; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CIP.|$|E

5000|$|On {{outbound}} convoys, {{the danger}} zone escort would escort the convoy {{to a meeting}} with the ocean escort at sea. The danger zone escort would return to base while the convoy proceeded to its destination under the protection of only one warship, the ocean escort. On inbound convoys, the danger zone escort relieved the ocean escort from duty and accompanied the convoys into the <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination,</b> generally when the convoys were within a short distance <b>of</b> their <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination.</b> [...] Ossipee served as a danger zone escort from the time of her arrival at Gibraltar until 30 October, with the exception of three special service cruises of short duration.|$|R

40|$|A {{group of}} European gas {{transportation}} companies within the European Gas Research Group launched in 2007 the [`]MOLAS' Project {{to provide a}} software program {{for the analysis of}} the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) ageing process during ship transportation. This program contains two different modeling approaches: a physical algorithm and an [`]intelligent' model. Both models are fed with the same input data, which is composed of the ship characteristics (BOR and capacity), voyage duration, LNG composition, temperature, pressure, and volume occupied by liquid phase at the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> origin, together with pressure at the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination.</b> The results obtained are the LNG composition, temperature and liquid volume at the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination.</b> Furthermore, the physical model obtains the evolution over time of such variables en route as it is based on unsteady mass balances over the system, while the i-model applies neural networks to obtain regression coefficients from historical data composed only <b>of</b> origin and <b>destination</b> measurements. This paper describes both models and validates them from previous published models and experimental data measured in ENAGAS LNG regasification plants.

50|$|Generally, most {{exporters}} {{are responsible}} for the organization and completion of the vehicle's transportation until it arrives at the importer's <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> <b>Destination</b> (POD). At the POD, possession of the vehicle, and the responsibility of possession, is laid on the importer. Financial responsibility, on the other hand, is transferred when ownership is handed over. Ownership is switched after the car has been purchased and before being exported. In the case of damage or losses occurring during shipping, the buyer is the one bears all financial loss.|$|R

40|$|The {{global market}} gives {{opportunities}} to the shipping company {{to develop its}} business, such as the larger market, the addition of new routes, the broader <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>destinations,</b> {{and the development of}} services. It will give effect to {{the increase in the number}} of markets served. Generally, shipping companies have a multi-segment market and apply specific strategies for each segment. One is the pricing strategy. To be more focus on each segment and able to serve it best, the company should define the appropriate price (rate) policy for every market segment. A study has been carried out at PT X, an international shipping company at Surabaya. As a world-wide company PT X has shipping service to various <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> around the world. From observation it was known that the company applies different pricing strategies for each segment of its market, like contract rate, negotiated rate, market rate, etc. Each strategy has certain advantages for its market segment and the company determines specific requirements for this strategy. Through those strategies a multi-segment market could be served well in accordance with the characteristics of each segment. It will provide benefits for the company, such as establishment and maintenance of good and profitable relations with customers. ...|$|R
