500|$|... "A Change Is Gonna Come" [...] was {{the first}} episode not to feature Washington's character, Burke. Washington was officially fired from the series, {{following}} an on-set incident with Knight and Dempsey, which {{had been in the}} media attention since the commencement of the production for the third season. News reports surfaced that Washington had insulted co-star Knight with a homophobic slur. Following the exposure of the argument, Knight publicly disclosed his homosexuality, which led to Washington's issuing an apology statement, regarding his inappropriate use of words during the incident. The controversy later resurfaced when the cast appeared at the 65th Golden Globe Awards ceremony, which saw Washington ridiculing homosexuality during an interview, following the statement that denied the occurrence of an on-set incident. After being rebuked by his studio, Touchstone Television, Washington publicly apologized at length for using the epithet in reference to Knight. An issue of People disclosed Washington's presence at executive counseling, which led to an undetermined hiatus of his contract. After [...] "Didn't We Almost Have It All?", the last episode Washington appeared in, was filmed, the network decided not to give Washington the possibility of a renewal. In a statement released by his publicist, Washington assesed, [...] "I'm mad as hell and I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> anymore". In another report, Washington stated he was planning to spend the summer pursuing charity work in Sierra Leone, while working on an independent film. In a subsequent interview, Washington highlighted the unfairness in his being let go from the series, considering filing a lawsuit as a result. He also accused Knight of using the controversy to bolster his own career and increase his salary on the series. Following his firing, Washington began asserting that racism within the broadcasting media was a primary factor in his dismissal from the series, which drew a critical perspective from Rhimes. During his appearance on Larry King Live, Washington once again denied using a homophobic epithet in reference to Knight.|$|E
500|$|Nikita and Maggie Q's {{portrayal}} of the character was met with generally positive reactions from television critics. Nikita was included in TV Guides lists of [...] "TV's Sexiest Crime Fighters" [...] and [...] "TV's Toughest Ladies". Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times felt that Q was suited for the role, stating [...] "she has a solemn, exotic beauty and hauteur that echo the heroine's self-possession and cool relentlessness," [...] adding [...] "Nikita is noticeably more hard-boiled and less girlish than the undercover agent played by Jennifer Garner on Alias, or the C.I.A. rookie that Piper Perabo plays on Covert Affairs." [...] Troy Patterson of Slate felt that [...] "Ms. Q's Nikita is only half so crush-worthy as Bionic Woman's Jaime Sommers or Dollhouse's what's-her-name, but her predicament is no less tasty." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today believed Q's performance was [...] "a fairly sizable incentive" [...] to watch the show, adding she [...] "combines stunt-fighting chops and lithe beauty with an unusual-for-the-genre air of somber intelligence. Her Nikita is not above cracking a joke, but it's clear from Q's eyes and bearing that she has suffered {{at the hands of}} evil men, and she's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> anymore." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix believed that Q [...] "carries herself {{in a way that makes}} it believable she could be a hard-core killer, and she has the requisite dramatic chops and charisma for the part." [...] Maureen Ryan of AOL TV said [...] "Maggie Q, has real charisma and presence; she invests Nikita's drive to bring down the secretive Division with potent energy. You have to believe that Nikita would devote her life to wreaking vengeance on the people she views as her former captors, and you also have to buy her as a butt-kicking, gun-toting action heroine who also looks great in a cocktail gown. Maggie Q makes all those things look easy." ...|$|E

[...] Washington himself said that his dismissal from Grey's Anatomy was an unfortunate misunderstanding that he was eager to move past. He later stated that if he were to be asked to make a cameo appearance on the show, he would not hesitate to say [...] "yes". Washington's image was used in advertisements for the May 9, 2008 episode [...] "The Becoming". After this aired, Washington's attorney Peter Nelson contacted ABC and Screen Actors Guild and cited this as an unlawful use of his client's image. His publicist, Howard Bragman, told The Hollywood Reporter that [...] "they have the rights of the character to advance the story, but not the image" [...] and stated he expected this to result in a [...] "financial settlement", but it is still uncertain whether this ultimately happened.|$|E
