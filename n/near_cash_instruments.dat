40|$|We {{propose a}} {{top-down}} model for cash CLO. This model can consistently price cash CLO tranches {{both within the}} same deal and across different deals. Meaningful risk measures for cash CLO tranches can also be defined and computed. This method is self-consistent, easy to implement and computation-ally efficient.

50|$|Leonsis left Harris Corporation in March 1981 when, {{at the age}} 25, {{he moved}} to Florida and began his first {{business}} venture. His first venture was publishing LIST, a technology magazine {{that focused on the}} then personal computing industry. He raised $1 million in seed capital with his partner Vincent Pica,.

Two years later, he sold the company to Thomson Reuters for $40 million netting him $20 million.|$|R
40|$|In this research, I {{surveyed}} merchant {{and customer}} preferences for <b>cash,</b> <b>near</b> <b>cash,</b> and electronic cash (e-cash). E-cash promises new but untested advantages in security, portability, and privacy. In this research, I conducted a large survey of e-cash acceptance by customers and retail merchants to provide 3 preference orderings for <b>cash,</b> <b>near</b> <b>cash,</b> and e-cash. Nonparametric hypothesis testing showed that e-cash was preferred to other payment methods, but the statistics were equivocal. Stochastic dominance statistics explained the equivocal results returned from nonparametric tests. E-cash dominated the hybrid card but was clearly dominated by traditional cash. E-cash neither dominated nor {{was dominated by}} credit cards and debit cards. After adjusting for technology adoption risk, a clear preference ordering was obtained: (a) cash and credit cards were preferred to e-cash, and (b) e-cash was preferred to debit cards and hybrids. I conclude that e-cash is unlikely to compete well against cash and credit cards for 3 reasons: (a) switching costs, (b) technology risk, and (c) insufficient market differentiation. The results suggest that {{there may not be}} a market niche for 6 -cash. Instead, successful products are likely to emerge in the form of vertical market cash substitutes that meet specific objectives. As commerce evolves toward customization to a focused cross-section of consumers, a "one-size-fits-all" e-cash is not likely to remain a viable product...|$|R

40|$|The credit {{derivatives}} market weathered {{the financial crisis}} of 1998 remarkably well. A recent survey estimated the notional volume of {{credit derivatives}} contracts was about $ 350 billion at year-end 1998, nearly double the level of 1997. • The growth in volume can be attributed {{in part to the}} emergence of investors who suddenly developed a healthy appreciation for a market where one can buy and sell protection on a variety of corporate names and emerging market issues. Clearly, credit derivatives are no longer an exotic corner of the bond market but must now be considered a market in its own right. • The major themes in the credit derivatives market (apart from the steady growth in volume) are the run-away dominance of the credit default swap product and the emergence of structured credit transactions that combine credit derivatives and <b>cash</b> <b>instruments.</b> Many investors cannot participate directly in the derivatives marke...|$|R

50|$|Liquidity {{risk and}} {{maturity}} mismatchLiquidity risk generally {{refers to the}} risk that a company may not have sufficient funding to satisfy its short-term needs, either through its cash flows, maturing assets, or assets salable at prices equivalent to book value, or through its ability to access funding markets. For example, if a company holds assets that are illiquid or that are subject to significant decreases in market value during times of market stress, the company {{may be unable to}} liquidate its assets effectively in response to a loss of funding. In order to assess liquidity, the Council may examine a nonbank financial company's assets to determine if it possesses <b>cash</b> <b>instruments</b> or readily marketable securities, such as Treasury securities, which could reasonably be expected to have a liquid market in times of distress. The Council may also review a nonbank financial company's debt profile to determine if it has adequate long-term funding, or can otherwise mitigate liquidity risk. Liquidity problems also can arise from a company's inability to roll maturing debt or to satisfy margin calls, and from demands for additional collateral, depositor withdrawals, draws on committed lines, and other potential draws on liquidity.|$|R
