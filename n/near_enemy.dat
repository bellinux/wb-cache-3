5|$|After Arthur Harris' {{appointment}} as GOC Bomber Command, the situation declined. Harris, since {{his days as}} a group captain at the Air Ministry's strategic planning division, had attacked the use of resources in maritime aviation, suggesting that bombing enemy shipyards and port facilities would solve the threat to trade defence. By November 1942, 259 Hudsons were available, but were shared by other services. The Whitley and Hampden were too vulnerable to operate <b>near</b> <b>enemy</b> coastlines without heavy fighter escort. Beaufort squadrons were sent to the Middle East to operate over the Balkans and North Africa. The highly successful de Havilland Mosquito was sought-after, but priority was given to the other two air commands. By February 1943, GOC Coastal Command John Slessor, had some 850 aircraft. But in respect of quality he was not impressed. Slessor continually wrote to the Air Ministry, complaining that Mosquitoes were being used as reconnaissance machines, while over 200 were being used by the RAF tactical air forces supporting the army, and merchant shipping was suffering high losses in the Atlantic. His successor Sholto Douglas' written records indicate the desire to upgrade, rather than produce new aircraft. By his tenure, January 1944, ten squadrons of Consolidated Liberators, five Vickers Wellingtons squadrons equipped with the Leigh light, and two Handley Page Halifax, Hudson, and Boeing Fortress squadrons were available. Among other technological developments, these long-range aircraft helped defeat the U-boats in May 1943.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{took place}} {{less than a}} month after Britain's {{declaration}} of war against Germany on 5 August 1914. Initially, the war on land went badly for the French and their allies, with German forces invading France and an urgent need to gather all possible troops to send to France to resist them. The British government was in a position of having nothing but bad news, and looked to the navy, the largest in the world and traditionally the mainstay of British military power, for some success to report. British naval tactics had typically involved a close blockade of enemy ports, taking the fight to the enemy, and this had been the British plan for war against Germany up to 1913. Such an approach was still expected by the British population. However, it was realised that the advent of submarines armed with torpedoes and mines hidden in open sea meant that any operations involving stationing capital ships <b>near</b> <b>enemy</b> ports would place them at great risk of surprise attack and loss. Then, there was the issue of fuel: powered ships, obliged to keep moving to reduce their vulnerability as sitting targets, were continuously using fuel and had to return to port every few days.|$|E
6000|$|His first {{feeling was}} a keen artistic delight. On a colossal pedestal, the cliff,--motionless {{at the extreme}} edge of the capping rock and sharply {{outlined}} against the sky,--was an equestrian statue of impressive dignity. The figure of the man sat {{the figure of the}} horse, straight and soldierly, but with the repose of a Grecian god carted in the marble which limits the suggestion of activity. The gray costume harmonized with its aerial background; the metal of accoutrement and caparison was softened and subdued by the shadow; the animal's skin had no points of high light. A carbine, strikingly foreshortened, lay across the pommel of the saddle, kept in place by the right hand grasping it at the [...] "grip"; the left hand, holding the bridle rein, was invisible. In silhouette against the sky, the profile of the horse was cut with the sharpness of a cameo; it looked across the heights of air to the confronting cliffs beyond. The face of the rider, turned slightly away, showed only an outline of temple and beard; he was looking downward {{to the bottom of the}} valley. Magnified by its lift against the sky and by the soldier's testifying sense of the formidableness of a <b>near</b> <b>enemy,</b> the group appeared of heroic, almost colossal, size.|$|E

The prisoners become suspicious of each other when their captors claim they have received cooperation, and physical wounds from torture are healed after interrogation.|$|E
50|$|During the First World War, screw pickets {{were used}} for the {{installation}} of wire obstacles; these were metal rods with eyelets for holding strands of wire, and a corkscrew-like end that could literally be screwed into the ground rather than hammered, so that wiring parties could work at night <b>near</b> <b>enemy</b> soldiers and not reveal their position by the sound of hammers.|$|E

50|$|A rocket-powered small {{aircraft}} with straight, constant-chord wings, {{the aircraft}} {{was to be}} towed or carried aloft by another aircraft and released when <b>near</b> <b>enemy</b> bombers. Igniting a Schmidding 533 solid-fuel rocket engine, it {{was to make a}} first attacking pass using the 14 nose-mounted R4M 55 mm rockets, before attempting to ram the enemy bomber's wings or tail. It was expected to survive the ramming of the bomber owing to the strength of its wing, which had a steel leading edge, and would make a landing on a retractable skid.|$|E
50|$|The {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 brought the United States into the war, but with eight battleships sunk or damaged by air attack. On 10 December 1941 HMS Prince of Wales and the battlecruiser HMS Repulse were sunk by {{land-based}} torpedo bombers northeast of Singapore. It was {{now clear that}} surface ships could not operate <b>near</b> <b>enemy</b> aircraft in daylight without air cover; most surface actions of 1942-43 were fought at night as a result. Generally, both sides avoided risking their battleships until the desperate Japanese attack at Leyte Gulf in 1944.|$|E
50|$|After {{failing to}} stop his vessels, Sampson ordered Iowa to train her guns on the <b>nearest</b> <b>enemy</b> stronghold, the Morro castle. This was only a ruse though; Iowa fired one shot {{into the water and}} the Spanish, believing they had been fired on, {{returned}} a salvo from their battery which failed to score a direct hit. Iowa fired again with a massive broadside which reportedly blew away {{a large portion of the}} castle.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{previous}} Bit Devices, the Psy Bits {{are capable}} of firing forward or backwards (the direction is controlled by movement of the ship itself). Finally, the Wave Cannon {{is replaced by a}} [...] "Bit Shot", where the Psy Bits detach from the ship and collide with the <b>nearest</b> <b>enemy</b> at high velocity. The Bits can only do this for so long before running out of energy, and must be recalled to the ship to recharge.|$|R

Most of them are insane or completely unaware of their own mortality. In battle they lurch towards the <b>nearest</b> <b>enemy</b> at random speeds.|$|R
5000|$|Mental condition: Close Combat used a {{psychological}} (morale) model {{for each individual}} combatant. The combatant's morale {{would be affected by}} factors such as being near officers, being supported by other units, being under fire, taking casualties, and being left without orders. Troops would be Stable when they were in no danger; Cowering when pinned down by enemy fire; or Panicked when surrounded by dead comrades, wounded or <b>near</b> <b>enemy</b> flamethrowers. The use of {{a psychological}} model made certain tactics, common in RTS games where the units will follow suicidal orders, impossible in Close Combat. For example, attempting a [...] "mass rush" [...] in Close Combat would result in units seeking cover, refusing to obey orders or even deserting.|$|E
5000|$|The {{emergence}} {{and development}} of the destroyer was related to the invention of the self-propelled torpedo in the 1860s. A navy now had the potential to destroy a superior enemy battle fleet using steam launches to fire torpedoes. Cheap, fast boats armed with torpedoes called torpedo boats were built and became a threat to large capital ships <b>near</b> <b>enemy</b> coasts. The first seagoing vessel designed to launch the self-propelled Whitehead torpedo was the 33-ton [...] in 1876. She was armed with two drop collars to launch these weapons; these were replaced in 1879 by a single torpedo tube in the bow. By the 1880s, the type had evolved into small ships of 50-100 tons, fast enough to evade enemy picket boats.|$|E
50|$|Players fly {{in a large}} {{battlefield}}. A typical {{flight from}} one end of the battlefield to the other end usually takes about forty minutes, depending on the traveling speed the player is flying to. The faster the player flies to his target also has the effect of consuming more fuel than usual due to afterburners, especially at low altitude, so some fuel conservation, careful planning and flying is required to come out alive. This battlefield is dotted with 2 sides of factories, towns, airports, power stations, radar installations and tank battalions. This map can be viewed in the Mission Room. Once <b>near</b> <b>enemy</b> border, any flights above 500 feet will cause enemy radars to track the player and MiGs to scramble and vector into the players' position, so this requires flying at low altitude to infiltrate enemy territory for strike missions.|$|E
50|$|Flicky was {{developed}} {{over the course of}} one year and was designed by Yoji Ishii with art done by Yoshiki Kawasaki. The chicks were originally dots that would disappear when collected. The bird designs were added later in development. The gameplay elements of losing chicks <b>near</b> <b>enemies</b> and having the birds follow Flicky were added to increase difficulty. Although some players may think Flicky is the mother to the smaller birds, Flicky is truly just a friend. Lizzie was added to the game after testing.|$|R

The Chi Shot with this scroll activated seeks out the <b>nearest</b> <b>enemy</b> with a lightning strike, while the Chi Blast unleashes the full fury of a thunderstorm upon all enemies in range.|$|R
50|$|On 12 September 1918 near Laventie, France, {{when his}} company was held up by enemy machine-gun fire at short range, Lance-Corporal Wilcox rushed to the <b>nearest</b> <b>enemy</b> gun, bombing it and killing the gunner. Being then {{attacked}} by an enemy bombing party, the corporal picked up enemy stick bombs and led his company against the next gun, finally capturing and destroying it. Then, left with only one man he continued bombing and captured a third gun. Going up the trench, bombing as he went, he captured a fourth gun {{and then returned to}} his platoon.|$|R
5000|$|A Seilbombe ( [...] , plural Seilbomben, [...] ), {{literally}} [...] "rope bomb", was {{a secret}} German weapon developed during the Second World War designed to disable the electrical power grid of an invaded territory. Equipped with it, a German Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighter plane or an Arado 196 float plane would fly low at night over areas <b>near</b> <b>enemy</b> power plants or urban centers where power lines were located and would use it to cause local blackouts. [...] This would, it was hoped, lead to civilian panic and the inability of local opposing forces to coordinate a defense. The piloting of planes so equipped was extremely dangerous, as it required the pilot to fly his plane almost directly at enemy power lines in the dark when visibility was already severely limited and within easy range of anti-aircraft fire.|$|E

40|$|White Paper. Monterey, CA: Defense Analysis Department, Naval Postgraduate School. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has {{attracted}} the world’s attention {{and much of}} its wrath, primarily because of its rapid expansion in Iraq and Syria, its brutal treatment of religious minorities (e. g., Yazidis, Christians), and its beheadings of hostages from Western countries. At this point, {{it is unclear whether}} the group represents a global or a sectarian form of jihadism. Is it similar to al-Qaeda, which seeks to target the far enemy (i. e., Western countries such as the U. S. that some in the Muslim world believe exert a corrupting influence on Islamic countries), or is it more sectarian in that it focuses on targeting what it perceives to be the near enemies of Islam (i. e., “corrupt” Islamic nations) ? In this paper we address this debate by examining ISIS’s online presence on the social media platform, Twitter, which serves as a forum for supporters to post and receive messages, images, videos, and links to websites to and from a wide-audience. The speed at which users can transmit and receive information via Twitter suggests that an analysis of ISIS-related user accounts and the key themes and concepts they disseminate can contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the group’s overall narrative. We examine ISIS’s online presence by extracting from Twitter the semantic networks of its most influential users. We find that a shift may be occurring in the ISIS narrative, from one that focuses on the <b>near</b> <b>enemy</b> to one that focuses on the far enemy. Ironically, this shift may have resulted from the actions of the U. S. and its Western allies...|$|E
40|$|Thesis 1 : The new {{does not}} arrive from some ‘other place’ (transcendence), but is {{produced}} {{from the very}} matter of the world, after all what else is there? And where else can the new come from? The new then involves a recombination of already existing elements in and of the world (a new dice throw as Deleuze might say). The new would then be a repetition, but with difference. As such the new must be distinguished from fashion, which involves a repetition of the same, that is, does not really involve a radical recombination of elements. However, the new is not opposed to fashion, but rather accelerates certain of its operating logics, namely the production of difference. After all, {{there must be a}} certain amount of difference for fashion to be what it is. Fashion in this sense is the <b>near</b> <b>enemy</b> of art. Here is my first question: is it enough to affirm a recombination of matter in order to produce something new? For example, a new art (or indeed a new subjectivity) ? Would this not merely involve playing with that which is already here, already has reality as it were? Or, following Deleuze, would not such a recombination involve playing with that which is ‘possible’, the latter being a mirror-image or isotope of the real, in fact being the same, conceptually speaking, only lacking reality. Or to phrase this question in a slightly different manner: is there really such a difference between the new in art and the new in fashion?
