Wood, having just received a BAFTA for the first series, said at the time: [...] "I was very pleased to win, but it really put pressure on me. I was already writing the new series and every time I looked at the award I kept on thinking that people would be expecting so much more <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just wouldn't be able to live up to it.

500|$|Kemp was a {{voracious}} reader, and {{his political}} beliefs were founded in early readings of Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative, Ayn Rand's libertarian novels, such as The Fountainhead, and Friedrich von Hayek's The Constitution of Liberty. He also brought from his football career a belief in racial equality, which came from playing football with black teammates: Kemp said, [...] "I wasn't there with Rosa Parks or Dr. King or John Lewis. But I am here <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am going to yell from the rooftops about {{what we need to}} do." [...] Kemp's football colleagues confirmed this influence: John Mackey explained that [...] "the huddle is colorblind." ...|$|E

At 17 years old, in his journal Sirius, she published her first poem which could be translated as [...] "On his hand you may see many glittering rings", (1907) signing it [...] "Anna G." [...] She soon became known in St Petersburg's artistic circles, regularly giving public readings. That year, she wrote unenthusiastically to a friend, “He has loved me for three years <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{believe that it is}} my fate to be his wife. Whether or not I love him, I do not know, {{but it seems to me}} that I do.” [...] She married Gumilev in Kiev in April 1910; however, none of Akhmatova’s family attended the wedding. The couple honeymooned in Paris, and there she met and befriended the Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani.|$|E
500|$|Laurence Olivier {{was paid}} $1 million to play General Douglas MacArthur in the film. He was {{contracted}} {{for six weeks}} of filming, and received a payment of $250,000 upon signing the contract and the remainder was given in four subsequent installments. His salary came out to $50,000 per day. In addition to this fee, Olivier also received $2,500 per week for his expenses. Olivier was interviewed during the film's production and explained why he agreed {{to be part of}} its cast: [...] "People ask me why I'm playing in this picture. The answer is simple. Money, dear boy. I'm like a vintage wine. You have to drink me quickly before I turn sour. I'm almost used up <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can feel the end coming. That's why I'm taking money now.

This was back when (Ronald) Reagan was the governor of California and he had a big function for all of the prisoners of war who were released. I thought he was a terrific guy, a real American hero." [...] Nevertheless, Eastwood wished Barack Obama well upon his subsequent victory saying, [...] "Obama is my president <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am going to be wishing him the very best because it is what is best for all of us." [...] Eastwood stated in 2010 of President Obama: [...] "I think he's a nice fella and I enjoyed watching him come along and I enjoyed watching him campaign and win the job. But I'm not a fan of what he's doing at the moment.... I just don't think he's governing. I don't think he's surrounded himself with the people he could have surrounded himself with." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Tarantino {{discussed}} an {{idea for}} a type of Spaghetti Western set in the United States' pre-Civil War Deep South. He called this type of film [...] "a southern", stating that he wanted [...] "to do movies that deal with America's horrible past with slavery and stuff but do them like spaghetti westerns, not like big issue movies. I want to do them like they're genre films, but they deal with everything that America has never dealt with because it's ashamed of it, and other countries don't really deal with because they don't feel they have the right to." [...] Tarantino later explained the genesis of the idea: [...] "I was writing a book about Sergio Corbucci when I came {{up with a way to}} tell the story.... I was writing about how his movies have this evil Wild West, a horrible Wild West. It was surreal, it dealt a lot with fascism. So I'm writing this whole piece on this, and I'm thinking: 'I don't really know if Sergio was thinking [...] while he was doing this.

Or… what does Hoobastank sound like? Uhh, I don’t know. Who cares. I’m old <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don’t remember anything. [...] In the end I didn’t want to sing the final version, so Pen did the singing in the show. He did more of a Blink 182 style thing. Blink 182? Is that right? ...|$|E

In Australia, she also did {{a photo shoot}} for Aaliyah with photographers Jeff Dunas, Jonathan Mannion, David LaChapelle, and Albert Watson. Aaliyah handled five pythons at the shoot and developed an affinity for snakes, finding them [...] "dangerous, but quite beautiful" [...] and representative of her on the album. She revisited the snake theme in her music video for [...] "We Need a Resolution" [...] in April and told MTV, [...] "They live in solitude, [...] there are {{times in my life}} [...] I just want to be by myself. There are times I can't even figure myself out. I feel they are very complex creatures, [...] at the same time, they're sexy, too. That's why they represent Aaliyah pretty well."

We have to deal with {{much the same way that}} Captain America, when thawed from the Arctic ice, entered a world that he didn't recognize," [...] similar to the way Stan Lee and Jack Kirby reintroduced the character in the 1960s. Likewise, Arad noted, [...] "Captain America stands for freedom for all democracies, for hope all around the world. He was created to stop tyranny and the idea of stopping tyranny is important today as it was then. So I think that we will have some interesting challenges but at the end of the day if the movie is terrific and the movie talks to the world, it's not about one place, it's about the world and I think [...] that basis it will be very successful." [...] Later, after the election of US President Barack Obama, Feige commented, [...] "The idea of change and hope has permeated the country, regardless of politics, and that includes Hollywood. Discussions in all our development meetings include the zeitgeist and how it's changed in the last two weeks. Things are being adjusted".|$|E
500|$|When Dewey Phillips first aired [...] "That's All Right" [...] on Memphis radio, many {{listeners}} who {{contacted the}} station by phone and telegram {{to ask for}} it again assumed that its singer was black. From {{the beginning of his}} national fame, Presley expressed respect for African American performers and their music, and disregard for the norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician Arthur Crudup—the originator of [...] "That's All Right"—"bang his box the way I do <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw." [...] The Memphis World, an African American newspaper, reported that Presley, [...] "the rock 'n' roll phenomenon", [...] "cracked Memphis's segregation laws" [...] by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its [...] "colored night". Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during the early days of his stardom. By contrast, many white adults, according to Billboards Arnold Shaw, [...] "did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} the film, Hillenburg {{wanted to end}} the series [...] "so [...] wouldn't jump the shark." [...] "We're working on episodes 40 through 60 right <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> always looked at that as a typical run for an animated show. [...] lasted about that long, for example. And I thought now {{was a good time}} to step aside and look at a different project. I personally think it's good not to go to the point where people don't want to see your show anymore," [...] Hillenburg said in 2002. However, Nickelodeon wanted to produce more episodes: [...] "The show was such a cash cow for the station that it couldn't afford not to," [...] storyboard director Sam Henderson observed. Initially Hillenburg doubted that the network would continue the show without him, saying: [...] "I think [...] respect that my contribution is important. I think they would want to maintain the original concept and quality." [...] Consequently, he resigned as the showrunner and appointed his trusted staff member Paul Tibbitt to the role. Although he no longer has a direct involvement in the production of SpongeBob SquarePants, he still retains a position as an executive producer and maintains an advisory role, reviewing each episode. While he was on the show, Hillenburg voiced Potty the Parrot and sat in with Derek Drymon at the record studio to direct the voice actors while they were recording. During the fourth season, Tibbitt took on voicing for Potty, while Andrea Romano replaced the two as the voice director.|$|E

500|$|After the {{commercial}} lackluster of her eighth studio album, Britney Jean (2013), Spears started her Las Vegas residency show, , which attained commercial success. Later, in September 2014, the singer posted {{a picture of}} herself in a recording studio, hinting that she was recording new music. In an interview with Extra, a month later, she revealed that she was working [...] "very slowly, but progressively" [...] on a studio album. She also released the song [...] "Pretty Girls" [...] in 2015 with Iggy Azalea, which was met with moderate impact. This resulted in Spears {{heading back to the}} studio to record more songs without having plans to release a new album. In late 2016, during interviews to promote Glory, Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record, and that it was her [...] "most hip-hop album," [...] explaining, [...] " [...] there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I've wanted to do for a long time <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just haven't really done that." [...] Talay Riley, who was among the songwriters that worked with Spears on the album, previously co-wrote Iggy Azalea's [...] "Bounce" [...] (2013) and Nick Jonas' [...] "Levels" [...] (2015). After the release of first single [...] "Make Me..." [...] and the promotional single [...] "Private Show" [...] on August 8, 2016, Spears and website PopCrush announced that [...] "Clumsy" [...] was going to be made available as the second promotional track from the Glory as an instant grant for those who pre-ordered the album.

500|$|Telegraph Avenue, {{adapted from}} {{an idea for}} a TV series pilot that Chabon was asked to write in 1999, is a social novel set on the borders between Oakland and Berkeley in the summer of 2004 that sees a [...] "large cast of {{characters}} grapple with infidelity, fatherhood, crooked politicians, racism, nostalgia and buried secrets." [...] Chabon said upon publication {{in an interview with the}} San Francisco Chronicle that the novel concerns [...] "the possibility and impossibility of creating shared community spaces that attempt to transcend the limits imposed on us by our backgrounds, heritage and history." [...] Five years in gestation, Telegraph Avenue had a difficult birth, Chabon telling the Guardian newspaper, [...] "I got two years into the novel and got completely stymied and felt like it was an utter flop.... I had to start all over again, keeping the characters but reinventing the story completely and leaving behind almost every element." [...] After starting out with literary realism with his first two novels and moving into genre-fiction experiments from The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay onward, Chabon feels that Telegraph Avenue is a significant [...] "unification" [...] of his earlier and later styles, declaring in an interview, [...] "I could do whatever I wanted to do in this book and it would be OK even if it verged on crime fiction, even if it verged on magic realism, even if it verged on martial arts fiction.... I was open to all of that and yet I didn't have to repudiate or steer away from the naturalistic story about two families living their everyday lives and coping with pregnancy and birth and adultery and business failure and all the issues that might go into making a novel written in the genre of mainstream quote-unquote realistic fiction, that that was another genre for me <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> felt free to mix them all in a sense." [...] The novel has been optioned by film producer Scott Rudin (who previously optioned and produced Wonder Boys), and Cameron Crowe is adapting the novel into a screenplay, according to Chabon.|$|E
