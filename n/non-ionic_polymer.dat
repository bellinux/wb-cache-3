Resistance to inactivation is affected by types and concentrations of surfactant proteins, lipids, and polymers. Our aim was to investigate the effects of different combinations of these three components. A simple lipid mixture (DPPC/POPG) or a more complex lipid mixture (DPPC/POPC/POPG/cholesterol) was used. Native surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C obtained from pig lung lavage were added either singly or combined at two concentrations. Also, <b>non-ionic</b> <b>polymers</b> polyethylene glycol and dextran and the anionic polymer hyaluronan were added either singly or in pairs with hyaluronan included. <b>Non-ionic</b> <b>polymers</b> work by different mechanisms than anionic polymers, thus the purpose of placing them together in the same surfactant mixture was to evaluate if the combination would show enhanced beneficial effects.

40|$|The {{influence}} upon adsorption of polymers containing different functional {{groups on}} the dispersion behaviour of titania pigment particle has been investigated at pH 6. 0 and 9. 5. The polymers chosen are polyacrylic acid and modified polyacrylamides including homo and copolymers modified with carboxylate and/or hydroxyl groups. A range of experimental methods including polymer adsorption isotherms, zeta potential, rheology and particle size measurements {{were used to assess}} the dispersion effect of the polymers. Adsorption of polyacrylic acid and anionic polyacrylamide copolymers onto the titania pigment surface is greatest when electrostatic repulsion is absent. At low pH values, below the pigment isoelectric point (iep), the adsorption density of the anionic polymers on titania pigment was high whilst at higher pH values, above the pigment iep, the adsorption density decreased. However, the adsorption of <b>non-ionic</b> <b>polymers</b> on titania pigment was less influenced by the pH. The presence of carboxylate functional groups in both polyacrylic acid and anionic polyacrylamide copolymer altered the titania pigment dispersion behaviour, reducing the suspension yield stress and mean particle size. The polyacrylamide homopolymer had negligible effect on the pigment dispersion properties at pH 9. 5, while it caused pigment particle aggregation at pH 6. 0. The hydroxyl-modified polyacrylamide had also a de-stabilisation effect on the pigment dispersion at pH 6. 0, but decreased the yield stress and the mean particle size at pH 9. 5.

CLEA’s activity is maintained; since it is considered as a restructured superstructure of the aggregates (Kartal et al. 2011). Hence, in order to stabilize these aggregates, the step of cross-linking appears to be necessary for the process so that the enzymes cannot be re-dissolved during the removal of precipitants.

The review is particularly focused on Na+-montmorillonite clay of the smectite group (Bentonite), due to its high swelling capacity, the ability to adsorb significant amount of polymer on its surfaces, and the formation of a gel-like structure with yield characteristics and viscoelastic properties at relatively low clay concentrations. A significant amount of research has been performed in these areas with applicability to various fields, such as soil science and drilling fluids, where interaction of organic polymers with the clay surface and the rheological response in the presence of electrolytes under different temperature and pressure conditions are of considerable relevance. In order to understand the interaction of these compounds with the clay surface and the rheological response of the resulting suspensions, it becomes essential to understand the structure of clay minerals, the interaction of clay particles in aqueous medium, the swelling behaviour and electrokinetic properties of Na+-montmorillonite clay. For this reason, the above topics are addressed, along with the general features of stabilisation of colloidal particles and the adsorption mechanism of non-ionic compounds on hydrophilic surfaces. A comprehensive review of the most relevant studies of the adsorption of <b>non-ionic</b> surfactants and <b>polymers</b> onto both silica and clay is presented. Finally, an overview of the rheological behaviour of concentrated suspensions and models used to describe the flow behaviour of clay suspensions is given, along with the effect of electrolytes, polymers, high pressure and high temperature on the flow behaviour of Na+-montmorillonite suspensions...|$|R
