60|$|Persecution came {{nearer to}} Rousseau and took more {{inconvenient}} shapes than this. A terrible libel appeared (Feb. 1765), {{full of the}} coarsest calumnies. Rousseau, stung by their insolence and falseness, sent it to Paris to be published there with a prefatory note, stating that it was by a Genevese pastor whom he named. This landed him in fresh mortification, for the pastor disavowed the libel, Rousseau declined to accept the disavowal, and sensible men were wearied by acrimonious declarations, explanations, protests.[164] Then the clergy of Neuchâtel were not able any longer to resist the opportunity of inflicting such torments as they could, upon a heretic whom they might more charitably have left to those ultimate and everlasting torments which were so precious to their religious imagination. They began to press the pastor of the village where Rousseau lived, and {{with whom he had}} hitherto been on excellent terms. The pastor, though he had been liberal enough to admit his singular parishioner to the communion, in spite of the Savoyard Vicar, was not courageous enough to resist the bigotry of the professional body to which he belonged. He warned Rousseau not to present himself at the next communion. The philosopher insisted that he had a right to do this, until formally cast out by the consistory. The consistory, composed mainly of a body of peasants entirely bound to their minister in matters of religion, cited him to appear, and answer such questions as might test his loyalty to the faith. Rousseau prepared a most deliberate vindication of all that he had written, which he intended to speak to his rustic judges. The eve of the morning on which he had to appear, he knew his discourse by heart; when morning came he could not repeat two sentences. So he fell back on the instrument over which he had more mastery than he had over tongue or memory, and wrote what he wished to say. The pastor, in whom irritated egoism was probably by this time giving additional heat to professional zeal, was for fulminating a decree of excommunication, but there appears to have been some indirect interference with the proceedings of the consistory by the king's officials at Neuchâtel, and the ecclesiastical bolt was held back.[165] Other weapons were not wanting. The pastor proceeded to spread rumours among his flock that Rousseau was a heretic, even an atheist, and most prodigious of all, that he had written a book containing the monstrous doctrine that women have no souls. The pulpit resounded with sermons proving to the honest villagers that antichrist was quartered in their parish in very flesh. The Armenian apparel gave a high degree of plausibleness to such an opinion, and as the wretched man went by the door of his neighbours, he heard cursing and menace, while a hostile pebble now and again whistled past his ear. His botanising expeditions were believed to be devoted to search for noxious herbs, and a man who died in the agonies of <b>nephritic</b> <b>colic,</b> {{was supposed to have been}} poisoned by him.[166] If persons went to the post-office for letters for him, they were treated with insult.[167] At length the ferment against him grew hot enough to be serious. A huge block of stone was found placed so as to kill him when he opened his door; and one night an attempt was made to stone him in his house.[168] Popular hate shown with this degree of violence was too much for his fortitude, and after a residence of rather more than three years (September 8-10, 1765), he fled from the inhospitable valley to seek refuge he knew not where.|$|E
40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: Ganglioneuroma {{is a rare}} benign nervous tumour {{frequently}} {{located in}} the retroperitoneal area. We report {{the case of a}} 22 -year-old female patient where this tumour was revealed by <b>nephritic</b> <b>colic</b> complicated by pyelitis and kidney abscess. EXEGESIS: The patient presented with brutal feverish lumbar pains and urinary signs. Abundant iconography, in particular contrasted enhanced sonography, allowed to show a massive retroperitoneal lump and a puncture-biopsy indicated a ganglioneuroma which was surgically removed by laparotomy. Signs may be varied and misleading. Biological and radiological exams are useful for the diagnosis which can only be confirmed by the thorough histological examination of the removed sample. CONCLUSION: A large retroperitoneal lump without alteration of the patient's health should point to this diagnosis, since the complete surgical removal leads to recovery without recurrence, but all the other differential diagnoses must first be dismissed...|$|E
40|$|Low-phospholipid-associated cholelithiasis {{syndrome}} (LPAC) {{is associated}} with ABCB 4 genetic mutation. ABCB 4 encodes MDR 3 protein, involved in biliary phosphatidylcholine excretion. Higher prevalence in women, biliary symptoms in young adults and ursodesoxycholic acid (UDCA) response are the main features. We report {{the case of a}} 48 -year-old man with hepatitis C, genotype 1 b, fibrosis F 3, null responder to Peg-IFNα 2 b/ribavirin and <b>nephritic</b> <b>colic.</b> In 2011 he developed jaundice, pruritus and epigastric pain. He showed increased serum levels of AST, ALT, GGT, bilirubin and alpha-fetoprotein, and viral load (14, 600, 000 IU/mL). Pancreatic-CT, endoscopic ultrasonography and echo-Doppler showed non-cirrhotic chronic liver disease. The episode resolved spontaneously and one year later he suffered a similar episode. UDCA was started with excellent response. An immunohistochemistry study and sequencing of ABCB 4 did not find alteration. MLPA® technique detected heterozygous deletion of the full exon 4 confirming LPAC syndrome diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: The {{association}} of primary {{carcinoma of the}} ureter and lithiasis is extremely rare. We report a rare case of a primary carcinoma of the ureter with corariform calculus. CASE REPORT: 60 -year-old phaeodermal female, reported a history of right-side <b>nephritic</b> <b>colic,</b> hyperthermia and pyuria during the past 20 years and had received treatment for urinary infections a number of times. The first clinical presentation was related to lithiasis and the tumor had not been shown up by excretory urography, cystoscopy or ultrasonography. Two months after the calculus had been eliminated, the patient began to have serious symptoms and a grade III transitional cell carcinoma of the ureter was discovered. Total nephroureterectomy and M. V. A. C. (Metotrexate + Vinblastina + Doxo Rubicina + Cisplatina) chemotherapy were tried unsuccessfully. In this report we emphasize the diagnostic difficulty caused by the concomitant presence of the two pathologies. In our opinion, the rapid evolution {{in this case is}} directly related to the high grade of the tumor...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Due to the {{increase}} observed {{in the incidence of}} pediatric urolithiasis in the world, and the scarcity of studies of this pathology in Morocco, we assessed whether epidemiological characteristics of pediatric urolithiasis have a similar profile like in developed countries further we tried to assess the prevalence of this pathology among children in Hassan II University-Hospital of Fez. Subjects and methods: Between January 2003 to November 2013, 104 pediatric patients with urolithiasis were presented to Hassan II University-Hospital of Fez. Eighty one were boys and 23 girls. Patients were referred from different regions of Moroccan states. Results: Out of 104 children diagnosed with urolithiasis, 5 patients with positive family history of renal stones, and 12 were recurrent (12 %). Their age varied between 8 months and 15 years old, {{with a mean age of}} 7. 86  ±  4. The sex ratio was 3. 5 : 1 boys to girls. Clinical presentations were dominated by micturition disorder (59 %), abdominal or flank pain (28 %), <b>nephritic</b> <b>colic</b> (22 %), hematuria (22 %) and urinary tract infection (13 %). Stones were located in the upper urinary tract in 62. 5 % of cases. Stones were treated by surgery in 89 cases (89 %), and with ESWL in only 2 cases (2 %). Over these years of study, a prevalence of 0. 83 % of childhood urolithiasis was calculated. Conclusions: This preliminary study represents only a region of the country, so more epidemiological analyses should be done. Stone analysis should be performed more frequently, and patients must be presented at earlier stages, before any development of renal failure...|$|E
40|$|Hypericum androsaemum L. {{is one of}} {{the most}} demanded plant species in the Portuguese popular {{medicine}} being associated to the natural History of the Gerês mountain ridge (Northern of Portugal), due to its ethnobotanical uses given by the local people [6]. Traditionally, H. androsaemum is sold dried, under the designation of “hipericão do Gerês ” and is used as an infusion [7], in cases of <b>nephritic</b> <b>colic</b> impaired digestion, boredom, and liver disturbances. The essential oils of Hypericum androsaemum L. were isolated by separated hydrodistillation of its leaves, stems and ripened seed capsules and by pentane extraction of the respective leaves infusion. Subsamples of fresh leaves (10 g), stems (10 g) and ripened seed capsules (10 g) were hydrodistilled with 500 ml of boiling water in a Clevenger type apparatus over 1 h, using volumes of 1. 0 mL of n-hexane, containing 5 -α-cholestane (1 mg/mL), for retention of the hydrodistillate components. The infusion was prepared by adding 150 ml of boiling water onto 15 g of the dried plant leaves keeping it submersed during 5 minutes. The infusion was left to cool for 15 minutes and then it was filtered and the respective essential oil constituents were extracted with 5 ml of n-pentane containing 5 -cholestane (0. 1 mg/ml). The hydrodistillates and n-pentane fraction of the leaves infusion extract were analysed by GC and GC-MS in order to identify and quantify the respective components. The EO yield of leaves was 0. 85 mg/g of biomass dry weight distributed in 103 compounds, 82 % of which were identified. From the 92 compounds detected in the EO of ripened seed capsules, 96 % were identified. The EO from stems, with only 63 compounds identified, had a narrower range o...|$|E
