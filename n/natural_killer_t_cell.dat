There she took interest dysregulation in autoimmune diseases and, in her fourth year at Harvard, discovered the protein known as Nk1.1(see <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell),</b> which soon became widely recognized across the field of immunology. For this discovery, Glimcher {{became the first woman}} to receive the Soma Weiss Award, an honor her father had received 26 years earlier. During this time, Glimcher worked with mentor Bill Paul, who strongly encouraged her to continue her research independently after completing medical school.During her second year of residency, Glimcher realized why she felt so drawn to this area of research. “What always fascinated me was not so much treating patients with disease, but figuring out why they had the disease,” says Glimcher.Glimcher currently heads her own lab for research in immunology. She has been interested in studying the ties between ER stress system in neurons and immune function and neuro-degeneration. Her past work has involved regulation of immune function and has shifted towards osteobiology with a focus on the bone disease osteoporosis. Her Harvard lab has a three-year contract with Merck for the drug Fosamax, a treatment for osteoporosis. Glimcher’s more current research looks to answer the question, “how does the immune system and the ER stress system in neurons impact neurodegenerative diseases?”.|$|E

40|$|The {{structural}} {{basis for}} the T cell response to glycolipid antigens (Ags) remains poorly understood. T lymphocytes autoreactive for mouse CD 1 (mCD 1. 1) or reactive for the glycosphingolipid αgalactosylceramide (α-GalCer) presented by mCD 1. 1 have been described previously. In this paper it is shown that mutations {{at the top of}} the α helices and in the bottom of the Ag-binding groove can disrupt both mCD 1. 1 autoreactivity and α-GalCer recognition. The locations of the positions that affect T cell responses indicate that recognition of mCD 1. 1 is not likely to be unconventional or superantigen-like. Furthermore, the effects of the bottom of the pocket mutation suggest that the autoreactive response could require an autologous ligand, and they indicate that α-GalCer binds to the groove of mCD 1. 1, most likely with the shorter 18 -carbon hydrophobic chain in the A′ pocket. <b>Natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> hybridomas with identical T cell antigen receptor (TCR) α chains and different β chains respond differently to α-GalCer presented by mCD 1. 1 mutants.

Here, we report a two-fold increase of iNKT-cell counts in spleen and liver after a 7 -day treatment of mice with IL- 33, which results from a direct effect, given that purified iNKT cells express the T 1 /ST 2 receptor constitutively and respond to IL- 33 by in vitro expansion and functional activation. Conversely to the expected pro-Th 2 effect, IL- 33 induced a preferential increase in IFN-gamma rather than IL- 4 production upon TCR engagement that depended on endogenous IL- 12. Moreover, in combination with the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL- 12, IL- 33 enhanced IFN-gamma production by both iNKT and NK cells.

These V beta biases revealed a broadly hierarchical response in which V beta 8. 2 > V beta 7 > V beta 2 in the recognition of diverse CD 1 d ligands.

We examined the effect of G-CSF administration after transplantation in mouse models and found that exposure to either standard G-CSF or pegylated-G-CSF soon after BMT substantially increased graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This effect was dependent on total body irradiation (TBI) rendering host dendritic cells (DCs) responsive to G-CSF by upregulating their expression of the G-CSF receptor.

However, the anticancer effects of α-GalCer were limited in early clinical trial. In this study, several analogs of α-GalCer, containing phenyl groups in the lipid tails were found to stimulate murine and human iNKT cells to secrete Th 1 -skewed cytokines and exhibit greater anticancer efficacy in mice than α-GalCer. We explored the possibility of different Vβ usages of murine Vα 14 iNKT or human Vα 24 iNKT cells, accounting for differential cytokine responses. However, T-cell receptor Vβ analysis revealed no significant differences in Vβ usages by α-GalCer and these phenyl glycolipid analogs. On the other hand, these phenyl glycolipids showed greater binding avidity and stability for iNKT T-cell receptor when complexed with CD 1 d. These findings suggest that CD 1 d–phenyl glycolipid complexes may interact with the same population of iNKT cells but with higher avidity and stability to drive Th 1 polarization.
