40|$|Background: In Thailand, pig {{production}} intensified significantly {{during the last}} decade, with many economic, epidemiological and environmental implications. Strategies toward more sustainable future developments are currently investigated, and these could be informed by a detailed assessment of {{the main trends in}} the pig sector, and on how different production systems are geographically distributed. This study had two main objectives. First, we aimed to describe the main trends and geographic patterns <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> production systems in Thailand in terms <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> type (native, breeding, and fattening pigs), farm scales (smallholder and large-scale farming systems) and type of farming systems (farrow-to-finish, nursery, and finishing systems) based on a very detailed 2010 census. Second, we aimed to study the statistical spatial association between these different types <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> farming distribution and a set of spatial variables describing access to feed and markets. Results: Over the last decades, pig population gradually increased, with a continuously increasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> per <b>holder,</b> suggesting a continuing intensification of the sector. The different pig-production systems showed very contrasted geographical distributions. The spatial distribution <b>of</b> large-scale <b>pig</b> farms corresponds with that <b>of</b> commercial <b>pig</b> breeds, and spatial analysis conducted using Random Forest distribution models indicated that these were concentrated in lowland urban or peri-urban areas, close to means of transportation, facilitating supply to major markets such as provincial capitals and the Bangkok Metropolitan region. Conversely the smallholders were distributed throughout the country, with higher densities located in highland, remote, and rural areas, where they supply local rural markets. A limitation of the study was that pig farming systems were defined from the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> animals per farm, resulting in their possible misclassification, but this should have a limited impact on the main patterns revealed by the analysis. Conclusions: The very contrasted distribution <b>of</b> different <b>pig</b> production systems present opportunities for future regionalization <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> production. More specifically, the detailed geographical analysis of the different production systems will be used to spatially-inform planning decisions for pig farming accounting for the specific health, environment and economical implications <b>of</b> the different <b>pig</b> production systems.

40|$|This thesis, {{entitled}} “Modelling {{the distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> production and diseases in Thailand”, presents many aspects <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> production in Thailand including the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> farming system, distribution <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> population and pig farms, spatio-temporal distribution {{and risk of}} most important diseases in pig at present, and the suitability area for pig farming. Spatial distribution and characteristics <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> farming in Thailand were studied using time-series pig population data to describe the trend <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> productions in relation to <b>pig</b> numbers, <b>holder</b> <b>numbers,</b> and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> per <b>holder.</b> In more detailed analyses, pig census data in 2010 were used to describe farming systems including type <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> (native, breeding, and fattening pigs), farm scales (extensive and intensive farming systems), type of farming systems (farrow-to-finish, nursery, and finishing systems) and to quantify the association between the geographical distribution of those and several predictor variables by using Random Forest models. The results show {{that over the last}} decades, the pig population has gradually increased over time, with a marked cyclical pattern corresponding to what has been termed the “pork cycle”. The spatial distribution <b>of</b> large-scale <b>pig</b> farms corresponds with that <b>of</b> commercial <b>pig</b> breeds, which are concentrated in lowland urban or peri-urban areas, and are close to means of transportation, facilitating supply to major markets such as provincial capitals and the Bangkok Metropolitan region. Conversely the smallholders are distributed throughout the country, with higher densities located in highland, remote, and rural areas, whence they supply local, rural markets. It is proposed that intensive pig production should be integrated with crop farming within a specific “pig zone”, designated for establishment of intensive farming, which includes the necessary input and output facilities and enhanced bio-security. For smallholder <b>pig</b> farmers, integration <b>of</b> pig-farming with crop production should be promoted and combined with capacity development for farm management, including enhancing the bio-security. Spatial epidemiology of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in Thailand was studied by providing a first description of the spatio-temporal pattern of PRRS in Thailand and to quantify the statistical relationship between the presence of PRRS at the sub-district level and a set of risk factors using two modelling approaches: autologistic multiple regression and boosted regression trees. An atypical and more virulent PRRS (HP-PRRS) emerged in China and spread to many countries, including Thailand, causing a lot <b>of</b> damage to <b>pig</b> production. The results indicated that farms with breeding sows may be an important group for targeted surveillance and control. However, these findings obtained at the sub-district level should be complemented by farm-level epidemiological investigations in order to obtain a more comprehensive view of the factors affecting PRRS presence. In this study, the outbreaks of PRRS could not be differentiated from the potential novel HP-PPRS form, which was recently discovered in the country. Spatial characterization of colonies of the flying fox bat, a carrier of Nipah Virus in Thailand was studied. We conducted field observation, remote sensing, and ecological niche modelling to characterize flying fox colonies and their ecological neighbourhoods. A Potential Surface Analysis was applied to map contact zones among local epizootic actors. Results showed that flying fox colonies were found mainly on Thailand’s Central Plain, particularly in locations surrounded by bodies of water, vegetation, and safe havens such as Buddhist temples. High-risk areas for Nipah zoonosis in pigs include the agricultural ring around the Bangkok metropolitan region where the density <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> farms is high. It is suggested that passive and active surveillance programs should be prioritized around Bangkok, particularly on farms with low biosecurity, close to water, and/or on which orchards are concomitantly grown. Integration of human and animal health surveillance should be pursued in these same areas. Such proactive planning would help conserve flying fox colonies and should help prevent zoonotic transmission of Nipah and other pathogens. Using Spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis to identify suitability <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> farming in Thailand was studied. The suitability maps were generated according to the three objectives obtained from decision making process including; i) pig producers’ profit is maximized, ii) public and environmental health are protected, and iii) pig health is protected and rural areas are developed. The maps showed that the areas surrounding the major consuming centres (Bangkok) were highly suitable for objective 1, the large areas in the Northeast were highly suitable for objective 2, and the areas with rather isolation including in the East and the South were highly suitable for objective 3. The final suitability maps were presented in 6 scenarios based on the level of trade-off and risk, which these can be applied for the appropriate situations. It is suggested that establishment <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> zoning, policy makers should take all aspects into consideration in order for sustainable development in all farm levels. The cost effectiveness should be further analyzed to evaluate the zoning plan before they are developed. Additionally, the plans to scale-up support to sustainable smallholder farmers and environmental management such as manure action plan should be developed. Bringing all these results together, this thesis are discussed into three parts, namely, 1) situation and distribution <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> farming, 2) epidemiology <b>of</b> major <b>pig</b> diseases, and 3) sustainable development <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> farming.

40|$|Based on {{the first}} 76 farrowings recorded, average {{duration}} (the time between the birth <b>of</b> the first <b>pig</b> and <b>of</b> the last <b>pig</b> in the litter) was 129. 09 ± 7. 28 minutes, and the average time interval between pigs was 15. 71 ± 1. 02 minutes.

40|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty-one first-litter sows were {{utilized}} {{to evaluate the}} effects of additional niacin on sow and litter performance through two parities. The control diet provided sows with 50 mg/d niacin during gestation and 100 mg/d niacin during lactation. Dietary treatments were formulated to provide sows with either 5 or 10 times the level of supplemental niacin in the control diet. Litter size was equalized within dietary treatment by 24 hr after farrowing. During the first parity, total <b>pigs</b> born, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> born alive, and pigs equalized per litter decreased then increased as dietary niacin level increased. However, sows fed additional niacin tended to wean more pigs per litter and, therefore, had greater pig survival from birth to weaning. Pig and litter weights at weaning were increased by increasing levels of additional niacin. Sows fed the intermediate level of added niacin had the greatest weight and backfat loss during lactation. During the second parity, additional niacin {{had no effect on}} the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> born or <b>number</b> born alive. However, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> equalized per litter increased then decreased as niacin intake increased. There were no differences in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> weaned, pig survival, pig weight, and litter weight at weaning from dietary treatment. These results suggest that first-litter sows fed the intermediate level of additional niacin during gestation and lactation had fewer total pigs born and born alive. However, these sows had more pigs at weaning, better pig survival, and heavier litters at weaning than those fed the 50 / 100 mg/d niacin gestation/lactation sequence.
