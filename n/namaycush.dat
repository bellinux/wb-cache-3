The lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), goldeye (Hiodon alosoides), and bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus) are fish species of the Saskatchewan river. Streams and ponds throughout the Saskatchewan prairies may be stocked with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), brook (Salvelinus fontinalis), and brown trout (Salmo trutta morpha fario and S. trutta morpha lacustris). Catfish (Sluriformes) and carp (Cyprinidae) range through the Frenchman river.|$|E
2500|$|The splake is an {{intrageneric}} hybrid {{between the}} brook trout and lake trout (S. <b>namaycush).</b> Although uncommon in nature, they are artificially propagated in substantial numbers for stocking into brook trout or lake trout habitats.

2500|$|Although {{completion}} of fish ladders {{on the lowest}} five mainstem dams in 1992 allowed salmonine passage as far as Twin Branch Dam in Mishawaka, Indiana, 94% of the fish that pass are salmon and trout, as the ladders were not designed to permit passage of migrating native fish. Historically, the migrating native species included lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), bass (smallmouth and largemouth), redhorse (silver, golden, shorthead, river, and greater) (Moxostoma ssp.), walleye (Sander vitreus), lake trout (Salvelinus <b>namaycush),</b> lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), northern pike (Esox lucius) and American pickerel (E. americanus vermiculatus).

50|$|Three {{subspecies}} of {{lake trout}} are accepted. There {{is the common}} lake trout (Salvelinus <b>namaycush</b> <b>namaycush),</b> the siscowet lake trout (Salvelinus <b>namaycush</b> siscowet), and the less common rush lake trout (Salvelinus <b>namaycush</b> huronicus). Some lakes do not have pelagic forage fish {{during the period of}} summer stratification. In these lakes, lake trout take on a life history known as planktivory. Lake trout in planktivorous populations are highly abundant, grow very slowly and mature at relatively small sizes. In those lakes that do contain deep-water forage, lake trout become piscivorous. Piscivorous lake trout grow much more quickly, mature at a larger size and are less abundant. Notwithstanding differences in abundance, the density of biomass of lake trout is fairly consistent in similar lakes, regardless of whether the lake trout populations they contain are planktivorous or piscivorous.|$|E

50|$|Lake trout (Salvelinus <b>namaycush),</b> like brook trout, {{belong to}} the char genus. Lake trout inhabit many of the larger lakes in North America, and live much longer than rainbow trout, which have an average maximum {{lifespan}} of 7 years. Lake trout can live many decades, and can grow to more than 30 kg.|$|E
50|$|The river flows east, {{passes through}} a rapid, and then enters <b>Namaycush</b> Lake. From here, it {{proceeds}} northwards through several lakes, the last being the largest at 10 km long and 7 km wide. The final 8 km include several uncharted rapids before the river's mouth reaches Hadley Bay, emptying into Viscount Melville Sound.|$|E
50|$|Northern cisco are preyed upon by a {{wide variety}} of predatory species, and have a {{particularly}} important place in the diet of lake trout (Salvelinus <b>namaycush).</b> It is also a common food of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), northern pike (Esox lucius), burbot (Lota lota), yellow perch, (Perca flavescens) and walleye (Sander vitreum) where the species overlap ranges.|$|E
50|$|Lake trout (Salvelinus <b>namaycush)</b> is a {{freshwater}} char living {{mainly in}} lakes in northern North America. Other names for it include mackinaw, lake char (or charr), touladi, togue, and grey trout. In Lake Superior, {{it can also}} be variously known as siscowet, paperbelly and lean. The lake trout is prized both as a game fish and as a food fish.|$|E
5000|$|The {{specific}} epithet <b>namaycush</b> {{derives from}} namekush, {{a form of}} the word used in some inland Southern East Cree communities in referring to this species of fish. Other variations found in East Cree are kûkamâsh, kûkamâw and kûkamesh. Similar cognate words are found in Ojibwe: namegos = [...] "lake trout"; namegoshens = [...] "rainbow trout", literally meaning [...] "little lake trout".|$|E
50|$|Crustaceans {{and insect}} larvae are {{important}} food items. Lake trout (Salvelinus <b>namaycush)</b> and burbot (Lota lota) {{are known to}} feed on shortjaw cisco. Shortjaw cisco {{are believed to be}} vulnerable to the invasive sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus,) which has presumably played a role in its decline in the Great Lakes, where expansion in the range of sea lamprey has overlapped the decline in shortjaw cisco numbers.|$|E
50|$|Lahontan {{cutthroat}} trout (LCT) {{is the only}} trout species native to Fallen Leaf Lake, Lake Tahoe and the Truckee River Basin but were extirpated by introduction of predatory non-native lake trout (Salvelinus <b>namaycush),</b> other competing non-native salmonids, and overfishing. Re-introduction into Fallen Leaf Lake of the Pilot Peak strain of Lahontan {{cutthroat trout}} (LCT), established as the LCT strain native to the watershed, began in 2006.|$|E
50|$|The Arctic char (S. alpinus) is {{the most}} broadly {{distributed}} Salvelinus species. It has a circumpolar distribution, and it is considered the most northern of all freshwater fishes. In North America, five relatively well defined species are present, which, apart from the Arctic char, comprise the brook trout (S. fontinalis), bull trout (S. confluentus), Dolly Varden trout (S. malma) and lake trout (S. <b>namaycush).</b>|$|E
50|$|The splake is an {{intrageneric}} hybrid {{between the}} brook trout and lake trout (S. <b>namaycush).</b> Although uncommon in nature, they are artificially propagated in substantial numbers for stocking into brook trout or lake trout habitats.

Splake grow more quickly than brook trout and become piscivorous sooner and are more tolerant of competitors than brook trout.|$|E
50|$|Lahontan {{cutthroat}} trout currently occupy {{a small fraction}} of their historic range. The primary obstacle to their recovery is non-native salmonid predation by brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) on fluvial cutthroat and lake trout (Salvelinus <b>namaycush)</b> on lacustrine cutthroat. Also, hybridization of cutthroat with non-native rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) continues to threaten recovery of the pure Lahontan cutthroat. Only Independence Lake has continuously harbored its historic native Lahontan cutthroat population, although precariously low spawner numbers there have recently increased along with five years of brook trout removal.|$|E
50|$|The lake trout, Salvelinus <b>namaycush,</b> is a {{cold water}} fish of the charr family. The largest of the trout species, it is a {{deepwater}} fish which is a cousin to the familiar and popular brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). The lake trout is native to the northeast United States and Canada, and it was once a top predator fish in the Great Lakes. Its numbers have dropped due {{to the introduction of}} exotic, non-native species such as the sea lamprey, loss of habitat and historic overharvest.|$|E
5000|$|The splake or slake (Salvelinus <b>namaycush</b> X Salvelinus fontinalis) is {{a hybrid}} of two fish species {{resulting}} from the crossing of a male brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and a female lake trout (Salvelinus <b>namaycush).</b> The name itself is a portmanteau of speckled trout (another name for brook trout) and lake trout, {{and may have been}} used to describe such hybrids as early as the 1880s. Hybrids of the male lake trout with the female brook trout (the so-called [...] "brookinaw") have also been produced, but are not as successful.The intrageneric hybrid is of the genus Salvelinus and, hence, is most properly known as a char or charr. In some locales, the fish {{is referred to as the}} wendigo. Although the hybrid is genetically stable and is, theoretically, capable of reproducing, splake reproduction is extremely rare, for behavioural reasons, outside the hatchery environment. The only known natural reproduction has occurred in five lakes in Algonquin Provincial Park in Ontario, Canada and, in each case, only a handful of progeny were produced. Because splake typically do not reproduce, they are used as a sport fish in many lakes across the US. Fishery managers are able to control populations numbers due to the extremely poor spawning success rate.|$|E
50|$|Like in many rivers around Europe, {{there are}} some {{introduced}} salmonid fish species in the Neretva. Of these only grayling (Thymallus thymallus) established stable population so far, while the more harmful rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) had lower survival rate and accordingly low population growth and small size. Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and lake trout (Salvelinus <b>namaycush)</b> have also recently been introduced to {{almost all of the}} Neretva basin reservoirs, but had only moderate to low success in establishing stable populations. At least for now populations of these invasive salmonids are rather weak.|$|E
50|$|To {{formally}} {{describe the}} species and prevent local fishermen from overharvesting {{in the absence}} of bag limits, specimens were sent to Harvard and the U.S. National Museum for identification, where the fish was first described as a form of lake trout (Salvelinus <b>namaycush),</b> and later as a variety of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). The silver trout was described as Salmo agassizii in 1885. W.C.Kendall, who published a famous monograph on New England chars in 1914, in turn concluded that the silver trout was related to the Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus).|$|E
50|$|The Thomsen River on {{northern}} Banks Island {{has been}} described as the most northerly multi-species river in North America. At least three fish species, lake trout (Salvelinus <b>namaycush),</b> least cisco (Coregonus sardinella), and ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), reach their known northern limit of distribution in the Thomsen River while the Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) is a common species. Lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) may also occur in upper reaches of the Thomsen and marine fourhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus quadricornis) are occasionally found in the lower reaches of the river. Approximately one half of the Thomsen River watershed lies within Aulavik National Park.|$|E
