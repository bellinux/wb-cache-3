40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with an analysis and optimisation of the <b>needle</b> <b>transfer</b> mechanism {{by means of the}} software Pro/Engineer Wildfire 4 with the aim to obtain a reduction of needle wear. An optimisation of parameters of the setting mechanism that influence the moment of release of the needle during its transfer from one needle bar to the other has been carried out. As a result the optimal setting of the <b>needle</b> <b>transfer</b> mechanism was found. Modifications of the design of the <b>needle</b> <b>transfer</b> mechanism were proposed which are leading to improved force effects in the gripping of the needle.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} the study {{described}} here is to extend our understanding of <b>needle</b> <b>transfer</b> behaviors among injection drug users (IDUs) by combining both micro and macro variables in a multilevel model. Methods: A sample of 8, 404 IDUs interviewed at 18 sites of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Cooperative Agreement for AIDS Community-Based Outreach/Intervention Program (COOP) was used for the study. A multilevel model was employed to deal with intraclass correlation in the sample and to evaluate the impact of micro and macro variables on <b>needle</b> <b>transfer</b> among IDUs. Results: A significant intraclass correlation was detected in the sample. <b>Needle</b> <b>transfer</b> was associated with both the individual characteristics and the features of the social setting in which they were embedded. Some of the micro slopes were fixed, while some varied from site to site, depending on the values of macro variables. The micro intercept and the micro slope of ethnicity vary randomly across social settings, while they are partially determined by macro variables. Conclusion: Considering the intraclass correlation in the data and the effects of contextual features on individual behaviors, multilevel analysis of HIV risk behaviors should be considered when combining data from micro and macro levels (e. g., individual and project site levels) ...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{evaluated}} focused {{training in}} coronary artery anastomosis with a porcine heart model and portable task station. MethodsAt “Boot Camp,” 33 first-year cardiothoracic surgical residents participated in 4 -hour coronary anastomosis sessions (6 – 7 attending surgeons per group of 8 – 9 residents). At beginning, midpoint, and session end, anastomosis components were assessed on a 3 -point rating scale (1 good, 2 average, 3 below average). Performances were video recorded and reviewed by 3 surgeons in a blinded fashion. Participants completed questionnaires at session end, with follow-up surveys at 6 months. ResultsTen to 18 end-to-side anastomoses with porcine model and task station were performed. Initial assessments ranged from 2. 11 ± 0. 58 (forceps use) to 2. 44 ± 0. 48 (needle angles). Midpoint {{scores ranged from}} 1. 76 ± 0. 63 (forceps use) to 1. 91 ± 0. 49 (needle angles). Session end scores ranged from 1. 29 ± 0. 45 (needle holder use) to 1. 58 ± 0. 50 (<b>needle</b> <b>transfer</b> and suture management and tension; P 0. 5). All respondents agreed that task station and porcine model were good methods of training.

40|$|Needlestick {{injuries}} can expose {{workers to}} a number of bloodborne pathogens that can cause serious or fatal infections. The pathogens that pose the most serious health risks are: hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [...] the virus that causes AIDS. HBV vaccination is recommended for all health care workers (unless they are immune because of previous exposure). HBV vaccine has proved highly effective in preventing infection in workers exposed to HBV. However, no vaccine exists to prevent HCV or HIV infection. Any worker who may come in contact with needles is at risk, including nursing staff, lab workers, doctors, and housekeepers. Estimates indicate that 600, 000 to 800, 000 needlestick injures occur each year. Unfortunately, about half of these injuries are not reported. Always report needlestick injuries to your employer to ensure that you receive appropriate followup care. The type of needles usually associated with needlestick injuries? include: hypodermic needles, blood collection needles, suture needles, needles used in IV delivery systems. Past studies have shown that needlestick injuries are often associated with these activities: recapping <b>needles,</b> <b>transferring</b> a body fluid between containers, and failing to dispose of used needles properly in puncture-resistant sharps containers. To protect yourself from needlestick injuries: avoid the use of needles where safe and effective alternatives are available; help your employer select and evaluate devices with safety features that reduce the risk of needlestick injury; use devices with safety features provided by your employer; avoid recapping needles; plan for safe handling and disposal of needles before using them; promptly dispose of used needles in appropriate sharps disposal containers; report all needlestick and sharps-related injuries promptly to ensure that you receive appropriate followup care; tell your employer about any needlestick hazards you observe; participate in training related to infection prevention; and, get a hepatitis B vaccination.

40|$|The {{capacity}} of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) to reduce pain, expedite patient recovery, shorten hospital stays and improve cosmetic results compared to open procedures {{has made it}} a trend in abdominal surgery. However, difficulties related {{to the nature of}} equipment (difficult visualization, tool fulcrum effect, etc.) show the importance of specialized surgical training and a need to provide high-quality visualization to the surgeon. Simulation-based surgical training has been growing not only as an innovative way to teach surgery but also as a method to assess the skill of a surgeon in performing a procedure, without risk to patients. However, cost and ease of access are two important limiting factors which make most surgical simulators ill-suited for practical processing of high volumes of surgical trainees. Lack of feedback in existing portable simulators such as instrument distance traveled and task completion time is another problem which presents a trade-off between the size of simulators and their capability. To address the aforementioned problems, a cost-effective and portable simulator has been designed to imitate specific training tasks for laparoscopic surgery in virtual environments via image processing and computer vision. Image processing provides real-time mapping of the graspers in the workspace to the virtual reality (VR) environment in four different tasks (peg <b>transfer,</b> <b>needle</b> passing, cube <b>transfer,</b> and eye-hand coordination). The capability of using various actual surgical instruments suited for these specific procedures gives heightened fidelity to the simulator.

40|$|We {{read with}} {{interest}} Drs. Giri and Vazquez's letter to the editors, "'Pick and Smear' Tissue Concentration Technique for Bloody Aspirates" (Acta Cytol 2001; 45 : 889 - 890). For some time now we have been practicing a similar technique. When we encounter bloody aspirates, we squirt a drop {{or two of the}} blood onto a glass slide and use the same needle to aspirate back as much blood in as little time as possible. Usually one sees tissue fragments, which we then "pick" off with the tip of the <b>needle</b> and <b>transfer</b> to fixative for preparation as a cell block. Speed is important {{to the success of the}} technique because if the blood clots, tissue fragments cannot be picked out, and the smears will be of inferior quality. Once the technique is mastered, the aspirator can usually repeat the procedure before rinsing the aspirate in formalin fixative. In this way, four smears and a cell block can be prepared. The advantages of this technique are threefold. First, squirting the material onto the glass slides means that no material is lost to the watch glass. Two, for the purpose of smearing, large tissue fragments are often inferior to minute, invisible ones. However, visible tissue fragments are superb for the cell block and reveal a surprising amount of architectural details, particularly when a 21 -gauge needle is used.

Thunbergia alataBojer ex Sims, popularly known as black-eyed Susan vine, is native to tropicalAfrica and grownworldwide as an ornamental. It is also considered a potential weed inBrazil, where it invades orchards and perennial crops mainly in coastal regions (Lorenzi 2000), and in Australia (Batianoff and Butler 2002). According to Starr et al. (2003) in Hawaii T. alata is a noxious weed and ‘has an aggressive habit, climbs on other vegetation and forms a dense blanket over large areas’. In August 2008, in the campus of the Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro, plants of T. alata were found showing irregular, elliptic or circular leaf spots, up to 1. 0 cm diameter, dark-grey to brown, with a darker border followed by a indistinct margin, mostly with a small white centre, sometimes causing the rupture of the foliar blade, rarely coalescing (Fig. 1). When infected tissue was examined under a stereomicroscope, typical Altenaria conidia were consistently observed on the lesions.

40|$|Because of {{its high}} growth rate (3 to 5 mm/hr) and {{the ease with which}} the powdery conidia become airborne, Neurospora has gained a {{reputation}} in some quarters as a laboratory contaminant. This reputation is largely undeserved. Cross-contamination or overgrowth of slow-growing cultures by Neurospora offers no serious threat in a well-ordered research laboratory. Good laboratory practice includes avoidance of drafts, attention to cleanliness, autoclaving of discarded cultures and contaminated glassware before dishes are washed, and care not to incubate cultures in closed containers where humidity approaches 100 % and Neurospora may grow out of plates and through plugs in a film of water. Thousands of Neurospora strains are maintained in pure culture, without problems of contamination, in leading research laboratories and at the Fungal Genetics Stock Center. Neurospora is commonly used side-by- side with other microorganisms in the same laboratory, without significant cross-contamination. Not surprisingly, someone accustomed to working with bacteria, yeast, Chlamydomonas, or a nonconidiating fungus such as Ustilago, Podospora, or Sordaria, may need to hold in check an impulse to open a petri dish and hold it up for inspection.

40|$|Animals {{have evolved}} {{many ways to}} enhance their own {{reproductive}} success. One bizarre sexual ritual is the "love" dart shooting of helicid snails, which has courted many theories regarding its precise function. Acting as a hypodermic <b>needle,</b> the dart <b>transfers</b> an allohormone that increases paternity success. Its precise physiological mechanism of action within the recipient snail is to close off {{the entrance to the}} sperm digestion organ via a contraction of the copulatory canal, thereby delaying the digestion of most donated sperm. In this study, we used the common garden snail Cornu aspersum to identify the allohormone that is responsible for this physiological change in the female system of this simultaneous hermaphrodite. The love dart allohormone (LDA) was isolated from extracts derived from mucous glands that coat the dart before it is stabbed through the partner's body wall. We isolated LDA from extracts using bioassay-guided contractility measurement of the copulatory canal. LDA is encoded within a 235 -amino acid precursor protein containing multiple cleavage sites that, when cleaved, releases multiple bioactive peptides. Synthetic LDA also stimulated copulatory canal contractility. Combined with our finding that the protein amino acid sequence resembles previously described molluscan buccalin precursors, this indicates that LDA is partially conserved in helicid snails and less in other molluscan species. In summary, our study provides the full identification of an allohormone that is hypodermically injected via a love dart.

Varying ratios of carboxymethylcellulose and gelatine (NaCMC/gel ranges 1 : 1. 60 – 1 : 2. 66) loaded with lidocaine were prepared and characterized for zeta potential and particle size. Additionally, variations in the formulation drying techniques were explored during the formulation stage. Ex vivo permeation studies using Franz diffusion cells measured lidocaine permeation through porcine skin after pre-treatment with stainless steel MNs and 20 kHz sonophoresis for 5 -and 10 -min durations. A stable formulation was related to a lower gelatine mass ratio because of smaller mean particle sizes and high zeta potential. Lidocaine permeability in skin revealed some increases in permeability from combined MN and ultrasound pre-treatment studies. Furthermore, up to 4. 8 -fold increase in the combined application was observed compared with separate pre-treatments after 30 min. Sonophoresis pre-treatment alone showed insignificant enhancement in lidocaine permeation during the initial 2 h period. MN application increased permeability at a time of 0. 5 h for up to 17 fold with an average up to 4 fold. The time required to reach therapeutic levels of lidocaine was decreased to less than 7 min. Overall, the attempted approach promises to be a viable alternative to conventional lidocaine delivery methods involving painful injections by hypodermic <b>needles.</b> The mass <b>transfer</b> effects were fairly enhanced and the lowest amount of lidocaine in skin was 99. 7...|$|R
40|$|Background: {{hospital}} personnel {{are at high}} risk of exposure, infection, and transmission of viral hepatitis. The present study aimed at investigating the knowledge, attitude, and performance of health service providers to provide them with the information required for their educational promotion on viral hepatitis. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 400 staff of the forenamed healthcare settings such as on nurses, midwives, licensed practical nurses, and lab officials in Isfahan, Iran, in 2012. A checklist including demographic data and questions associated with the knowledge (18 questions), attitude (4 questions), and performance (15 questions) on hepatitis B and C was completed by the participants. Results: A total of 388 participants completed the checklist. Participants′ knowledge on the ways of transmission, prevalence, vaccination, and prevention methods was moderate (total score = 58. 56 ± 10. 1 percent) and the attitude was generally positive. Proper vaccination was carried out by 81. 4 % of the participants. Accidental injury by a needle was reported in 47. 7 % of the participants, but only 37. 6 % of them reported it to higher authorities and of them only 13. 7 % received appropriate treatment. Only 44. 3 % and 11. 6 % of participants reported always using gloves and masks, respectively, and 58. 8 % of the staff covered the <b>needle</b> cap before <b>transferring</b> it to the safety box. Conclusions: Due to excessive contact with patients, a paramedic-educated society is expected to have an optimal level of knowledge, attitude, and performance related to viral hepatitis.

40|$|Liver {{cancer is}} {{a major cause of}} death {{worldwide}} and the impact that it has is set to increase in the coming decades. More than half a million cases are diagnosed each year and it is likely many more sufferers are dying unidentified in parts of the world with poor healthcare. Survival rates for untreated cases after diagnosis are low with few patients living beyond one year. A key cause for low survival rates being that the standard treatment is surgical resection; fewer than one quarter of patients are suitable for invasive surgery and five year survival rates rarely exceeds 66 %. RadioFrequency Ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive technique which utilises the electrically resistive property of tissue to deposit heat energy locally {{in the vicinity of the}} tips of an RFA <b>needle.</b> Heat is <b>transferred</b> away through the tissue by conduction, convection of large blood vessels, and bulk flow of blood in smaller vessels. Liver cells, both cancerous and benign, when exposed to the resultant abnormally high temperatures die considerably more rapidly than in cases of natural hyperthermia. It is thus the radiotherapist’s objective to place the RFA needle in a position that maximises destruction of tumour cells, but minimises the collateral damage of surrounding healthy cells. The learning curve of this nontrivial task is reflected unfavourably in the statistics that relate patient survival rate to clinician experience. In this thesis two mathematical models are presented that could be combined into a ‘global’ model of the effects of RFA. To predict cell death in these conditions under RFA, the O’NeillModel is presented in which cells are accounted for by one of three states: alive, vulnerable, and dead. A mechanistic interpretation of the O’Neill Model is attained through comparison to a model from the literature. A known, but little investigated occurrence of tissue swelling in the annular region peripheral to the ablation volume is modelled in a novel way through equations from the literature that track ion transport across the cell membrane; the O’Neill Model for cell death is also incorporated into this model of oedema.

A cell undergoing DNA replication (S phase) contains a factor(s) that induces DNA synthesis prematurely in a G(, 1) nucleus when an S phase cell is fused to a G(, 1) cell. An assay for the active factor(s) was developed in which a mixture of s phase extract loaded red blood cells (RBC) and synchronous G(, 1) HeLa cells was centrifuged onto Concanavalin A (Con A) treated coverslips and fused by PEG. This technique is called 2 ̆ 2 Centrifusion 2 ̆ 2. The synchronous G(, 1) HeLa cells injected with S phase extract initiated DNA synthesis earlier than the control G(, 1) cells mock injected with RBC loaded with buffer. ^ Chapter 2. It has been demonstrated that fusion between a mitotic and an interphase cell usually leads to breakdown of the interphase nucleus, followed by condensation of the interphase chromatin into discrete chromosomes, a process termed premature chromosome condensation. I wanted to develop an assay for the mitotic factor(s) that induces premature chromosome condensation. Experiments were performed utilizing glass needle mediated microinjection of HeLa cell mitotic extract into interphase somatic mammalian cells {{in an attempt to}} induce premature chromosome condensation. However, I was not able to induce premature chromosome condensation in the interphase cells, probably because of an inability to introduce sufficient mitotic factor(s) into the cells. ^ Chapter 3. A recombinant plasmid containing the chicken ovalbumin gene and three copies of the Herpes thymidine Kinase gene (pOV 12 -TK) was introduced into mouse LMTK(2 ̆ 7 -) cell nuclei using glass <b>needle</b> mediated gene <b>transfer</b> resulting in LMTK(2 ̆ 7 +) clones that were selected for in HAT medium. Restriction enzyme analysis of the high molecular weight DNA from 6 HAT medium survivor cell clones revealed the presence of one or at best only a few copies of the 12 kb ovalbumin gene per mouse genome. Further analysis showed the ovalbumin DNA was not rearranged and was associated with high molecular weight mouse cell DNA. Each of the analyzed cell clones produced ovalbumin demonstrating that the biological activity of the microinjected ovalbumin was retained. ...|$|R
