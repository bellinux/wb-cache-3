40|$|A {{secondary}} suspension injection system was designed, manufactured and tested, {{with the aim}} of depositing composite coatings formed by a conventional air plasma sprayed matrix embedding heat-sensitive phases sprayed and protected in a liquid suspension flow. The system is composed of two main sections: a pressurized vessel, equipped with regulation and recirculation sub-systems, and an adjustable <b>nozzle</b> <b>holder.</b> Preliminary experimental activities were performed with an alumina/graphite system and focused on the evaluation of the effect of the main SSIS parameters on the amount of retained lubricating phase in the deposits on deposition efficiency and coating microstructure. Alumina powders were fed in the plasma plume by a conventional injection system (argon carrier gas) whereas graphite powder was injected by SSIS from a water-based slurry. A CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software, originally developed for the simulation of plasma spray processes, was implemented in order to confirm the possibility of predicting the effect of the variation of operating parameters on the amount of surviving heat-sensitive phases, potentially embedded in the ceramic matrix. Deposited composite coatings were characterized in terms of thickness, graphite content, phase distribution and tribological properties. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe main way of {{controlling}} grapevine pests and diseases is by spraying them with crop protection products. The {{aim is to}} deposit as many droplets as possible on potential or already established infection/infestation points. A prototype sprayer was constructed with its <b>nozzle</b> <b>holder</b> booms forming a kind of tunnel that travels over the plants. Spraying is thus performed in an enclosed space, preventing the shower of droplets from being blown away by the wind. A low evaporation rate is also achieved. Further, since the droplets have to travel only a very short distance between the nozzles and the plant surface, the coverage achieved approaches the ideal for crop protection purposes. The efficiency of the applications was determined using water-sensitive paper attached to {{the leaves of the}} plants during spraying; after spraying, these were examined using an artificial vision system. The results show that, at the maximum pressure assayed (0. 6 MPa), the mean coverage percentage exceeded 54 % - sometimes reaching up to 79 %. This indicates that ideal product application conditions were approached, the product forming a nearly continuous film on the plant surface...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{optimization}} of the machining assisted by cryogenic cooling. The main objective is to analyze {{the effect of the}} pressure and the flow of liquid nitrogen on tool life when machining titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V using the cryogenic assisted machining. A <b>nozzle</b> <b>holder</b> has been specially developed for this study to ensure positioning and the replacement of calibrated nozzles of different diameters. Several nozzle diameters have been therefore used in order to vary the pressure and the flow according to tests to be conducted. The flow rate has been varied between 1. 2 l/min and 3. 4 l/min for two pressure ranges 8 - 10 bar and 4 - 5 bar respectively. The machining tests have allowed to highlight the effect of the pressure and flow rate of liquid nitrogen jet on the tool life. Indeed, the results showed that increasing the flow rate increases the tool life. In addition, the increase in pressureslowed down the evolution of the wear and further improves the tool life. Indeed, in all tested cases, the cryogenic assistance improves the tool life but the best results have been obtained for the highest pressure and flow rate. Moreover, surface integrity has been greatly improve...|$|E

After considering the best location for {{the installation of the}} air supply port, the air outlet was mounted on the cup holder. Because of its concentric circular form, the outlet located in the cup holder is able to blow air upward to the occupied zone. An experimental cooling performance evaluation was conducted, which compared the proposed cup <b>holder</b> <b>nozzle</b> with standard, riser-mounted, stadium air conditioning systems...|$|R
40|$|A device removes, {{with high}} precision, the {{majority}} of surface particle contamination greater than 1 -micron-diameter in size from ultrapure semiconductor wafer materials containing implanted solar wind samples returned by NASA's Genesis mission. This cleaning device uses a 1. 5 -liter/minute flowing stream of heated ultrapure water (UPW) with 1 - MHz oscillating megasonic pulse energy focused at 3 to 5 mm away from the wafer surface spinning at 1, 000 to 10, 000 RPM, depending on sample size. The surface particle contamination is removed by three processes: flowing UPW, megasonic cavitations, and centripetal force from the spinning wafer. The device can also dry the wafer fragment after UPW/megasonic cleaning by continuing to spin the wafer in the cleaning chamber, which is purged with flowing ultrapure nitrogen gas at 65 psi (. 448 kPa). The cleaner also uses three types of vacuum chucks that can accommodate all Genesis-flown array fragments in any dimensional shape between 3 and 100 mm in diameter. A sample vacuum chuck, and the manufactured UPW/megasonic <b>nozzle</b> <b>holder,</b> replace the human deficiencies by maintaining a consistent distance between the nozzle and wafer surface as well as allowing for longer cleaning time. The 3 - to 5 -mm critical distance {{is important for the}} ability to remove particles by megasonic cavitations. The increased UPW sonication time and exposure to heated UPW improve the removal of 1 - to 5 -micron-sized particles...|$|E
40|$|Background Hot-drinks vending {{machines}} are disseminated worldwide {{and millions of}} drinks are served every day. Because {{of a lack of}} studies on hot-drinks related illnesses, the aim of the study is to identify the presence and load of bacterial species, potentially harmful for consumers, within hot-drinks {{vending machines}}. Methods This preliminary cross sectional study was carried out in April 2015 at the University of Siena, Italy. 12 samples from 4 hotdrinks vending machines(VM) were taken using a sterile swab; samples were taken from: i) Dispense Area, ii) <b>Nozzle,</b> iii) Glass- <b>Holder.</b> The samples were analyzed in the laboratory and sown on selective terrains. Results were expressed both in terms of average CFU/swab between the samples of the 4 VM, and in terms of CFU/cm 2, relying on guidelines of surfaces sanitation, which fix the limit in 50 CFU/cm 2. Total Microbial Load(TML) at 36 C and 22 C was assessed for mesophilic and psychrophilic contamination. Descriptive analysis were performed. Results All the analyzed surfaces exceeded the fixed limit. Nozzles were the mostly contaminated, showing a bacterial load of 82500 CFU/swab (SD: 41662), correspondent to 2063 CFU/cm 2. Dispense Area showed an high presence of bacteria (TML from 28125 CFU/swab to Uncountable Microbial Colonies (UMC) both at 36 C, and at 22 C). The TML of the Glass- Holder went from 1380 CFU/swab to UMC at 36 C, and from 1050 CFU/swab to UMC at 22 C. In particular the nozzle showed a mean of 22770 CFU/swab(SD: 27444), correspondent to 569 CFU/cm 2 of Staphylococcus spp, and 25399 CFU/swab (SD: 35252), correspondent to 635 CFU/cm 2 of Enterococcus spp. Conclusions Given the high number of CFU/swab and the presence of harmful species that we identified so far, VM may constitute a potential threat for consumer, reason for which further studies are recommendable. Key messages The use of hot beverage vending machines is increasing in the world because of changes in food habits Hot beverage vending machines may constitute a potential threat because of high microbial contaminants, including pathogen ones, which we have identifie...|$|R
