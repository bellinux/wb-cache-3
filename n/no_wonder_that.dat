5|$|Some {{say that}} {{nothing could be more}} desperate than the measure, but I answer that the state of the Province {{admitted}} of nothing but desperate remedies. I got possession of the letters my antagonist addressed to the Secretary at War, and also of the sentiments which hundreds of his army uttered to their friends. Confidence in the General was gone, and evident despondency prevailed throughout. I have succeeded beyond expectation. I crossed the river contrary to the opinion of Cols. Procter, St. George etc.; it is therefore <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> envy should attribute to good fortune what in justice to my own discernment, I must say, proceeded from a cool calculation of the pours and contres.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the above}} it is <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> {{within a few}} years the academy’s {{excellent}} reputation had spread so quickly that by 1814 Mordecai was forced to cap enrollment at 110 students.|$|E

25|$|Budan's theorem {{forms the}} basis for Vincent's theorem and Vincent's (exponential) method for the {{isolation}} of the real roots of polynomials. Therefore, there is <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> Vincent in both of his papers of 1834 and 1836 states Budan's theorem and contrasts it with the one by Fourier. Vincent was the last author in the 19th century to state Budan's theorem in its original form.|$|E
25|$|So it was <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> neither Finland nor Germany {{wanted a}} formalized {{alliance}} {{in the beginning}} in their fight against the Soviet Union, though for very different reasons. It was only after the war turned out to last longer than expected that German interest in an alliance treaty rose, although by then the Finns had even less desire to bind themselves with a formal treaty. Germany tried several times to pressure the Finns by cutting food and arms deliveries, but the military importance of Finnish participation resulted in their resumption quite soon afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Later {{development}} of the Stelo stagnated. The Universal League founders wanted to show their good will by maintaining a constant value for the Stelo, but their efforts were doomed to failure. The Dutch price of bread gradually increased, but nobody thought to adjust {{the relationship between the}} Stelo and the guilder. The ratio remained four Steloj to the guilder, and bank currency conversion tables were used to fix the value of the Stelo in other countries. Moreover, even the Universal League gave up the idea of recording bookkeeping transactions in Stelo monetary units, so nobody gained experience with a coin of constant value. It is <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> the Stelo lost its reputation and that its use even by Esperantists became rare.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason for}} the sad state of public transit is a very basic one - the transit systems just do not offer a service which will attract people away from their automobiles. Consequently, their {{patronage}} comes very largely from those who cannot drive, either because they are too young, too old, or because they are too poor to own and operate an automobile. Look {{at it from the}} standpoint of a commuter who lives in a suburb and is trying to get to work in the central business district (CBD). If he is going to go by transit, a typical scenario might be the following: he must first walk to the closest bus stop, let us say a five or ten minute walk, and then he may have to wait up to another ten minutes, possibly in inclement weather, for the bus to arrive. When it arrives, he may have to stand unless he is lucky enough to find a seat. The bus will be caught up in street congestion and move slowly, and it will make many stops completely unrelated to his trip objective. The bus may then let him off at a terminal to a suburban train. Again he must wait, and, after boarding the train, again experience a number of stops {{on the way to the}} CBD, and possibly again he may have to stand in the aisle. He will get off at the station most convenient to his destination and possibly have to transfer again onto a distribution system. It is <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> in those cities where ample inexpensive parking is available, most of those who can drive do drive.|$|E

He would involve himself so closely with the plays that he was once terrified by the Ghost in Hamlet and had to [...] "have people about him".

It is very possible that he felt [...] "homeless" [...] during this time and surely {{felt that he was}} in a [...] "limbo... between public and private space". In London, only a few of his works were still being published. However, not everyone viewed Smart's [...] "madness" [...] as problematic, and Johnson defended him, sometimes seriously and sometimes comically, many times. A century later, Robert Browning later remarked that A Song to David was great because Smart was mad, and that the poem allowed him to rank alongside of Milton and Keats. It is <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> a few of his loyal friends did come to Mr. Potter's and freed him.|$|E

[...] Tony Brown, who played piano for Presley regularly in the last two years of the singer's life, observed his rapidly declining health and the urgent need to address it: [...] "But we all knew it was hopeless because Elvis was surrounded by that little circle of people... all those so-called friends". In the Memphis Mafia's defense, Marty Lacker has said, [...] " [...] was his own man.... If we hadn't been around, he would have been dead a lot earlier." ...|$|E
500|$|Giving {{the album}} {{three out of}} five stars, Ben Ratliff from Rolling Stone {{summarized}} that the messages on the album are dour, but complimented Madonna for talking about the then-current situation of the nation. Johny Davis from NME gave the album a rating of seven out of ten, saying that technically the album sounds good, but overall it felt like an unnecessary sequel to Madonna's previous endeavors like Ray of Light and Music. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated that American Life is better for what it promises than what it delivers, {{and that it is}} better in theory than practice. Kelefa Sanneh from Blender awarded the album three stars out of five. [...] "Just as disjointed as Music and much more severe... Without a compelling back story, her songs seem diminished". Dorian Lynskey from Q magazine also rated it three out of five, stating [...] "'Nothing Fails', the album's centerpiece, is as good a showstopper as 'Live to Tell'... it's <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> a record about feeling confused ends up sounding confused".|$|E

GameSpot featured {{him in their}} 2009 poll {{for the title of}} [...] "All Time Greatest Game Hero", in which he lost to Yoshi. UGO Networks ranked him as 94th on the 2008 list of top heroes of all time, noting his role in the Mortal Kombat series as well as character depth. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as 51st [...] "most memorable, influential, and badass" [...] protagonist in games, adding that while [...] "Sub-Zero and Scorpion may get most of the fanfare", Liu Kang [...] "can shoot fireballs, whoops and hollers just like Bruce Lee, and pioneered the Animality with his dragon-transformation fatality--it’s <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> Liu Kang’s the chosen champion of Earthrealm." [...] In 2014, Jack Pooley of What Culture ranked him as the second greatest ever fighting game character. DigitalSpy listed him as the 13th best Mortal Kombat character comparing him with Street Fighter character Ryu, stating they while both are [...] "kind of dull", they develop appealing techniques across their respective series. Complex listed Liu Kang as the third best character in the franchise based on his heroic traits, moves as well as his undead form.|$|E
500|$|More than {{a century}} after his death, {{literary}} critics such as G. Birkbeck Hill and T. S. Eliot came to regard Johnson as a serious critic. They began to study Johnson's works with an increasing focus on the critical analysis found in his edition of Shakespeare and Lives of the Poets. Yvor Winters claimed that [...] "A great critic is the rarest of all literary geniuses; perhaps the only critic in English who deserves that epithet is Samuel Johnson". F. R. Leavis agreed and, on Johnson's criticism, said, [...] "When we read him we know, beyond question, {{that we have here}} a powerful and distinguished mind operating at first hand upon literature. This, we can say with emphatic conviction, really is criticism". Edmund Wilson claimed that [...] "The Lives of the Poets and the prefaces and commentary on Shakespeare are among the most brilliant and the most acute documents in the whole range of English criticism". The critic Harold Bloom placed Johnson's work firmly within the Western canon, describing him as [...] "unmatched by any critic in any nation before or after him...Bate in the finest insight on Johnson I know, emphasised that no other writer is so obsessed by the realisation that the mind is an activity, one that will turn to destructiveness of the self or of others unless it is directed to labour." [...] It is <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> his philosophical insistence that the language within literature must be examined became a prevailing mode of literary theory during the mid-20th century.|$|E

[...] Tirdad Derakhshani of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of five, saying [...] "If you're looking for quality prepackaged, predigested Hollywood family fun this summer, you could do a lot worse than Despicable Me 2." [...] Keith Uhlich of Time Out gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "A fleeter film than its predecessor, Despicable Me 2 delights more often than it disappoints." [...] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap gave the film a negative review, saying [...] "The minions are still wacky scene-stealers– and once again, we don't get nearly enough of them– but Gru and his daughters have been blanded down to bad-sitcom level." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "With its predecessor having made a whopping $540 million globally, it's <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> Universal saw fit to order a sequel. But it's not enough just to trot out legions of minions and cobble together a plot. Audiences deserve more imagination and inventiveness than this wan recycling." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a 'C' grade, saying [...] "By the end, every child in the audience will want his or her own monster-minion toy. Adults will just regret the way that Despicable Me 2 betrays the original film's devotion to bad-guy gaiety." ...|$|E

Vice Admiral Tochinai Sojiro, who arrived aboard Tokiwa, relieved Moriyama who was due to return home.
