English Education Department. Faculty of Tarbiyah and Teacher Training. State Islamic Institute (IAIN) of Tuluungagung. Advisor : H. Nursamsu, M. Pd. 	Key words : Factors, Reluctance, <b>Speak</b> <b>English,</b> Classroom Interaction Learning <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> {{a foreign}} {{language}} requires more than knowing its grammatical and semantic rules. For this reason, {{it is understandable that}} EFL learners find a significant difficulty <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> the target language fluently and appropriately. Despite this fact, however, many learners often measure their success in language learning as well as the effectiveness of their EFL course on the basis of how much they feel they have improved in their speaking proficiency. Classroom interaction is very essential in education system because classroom interaction is related to how the teacher and the students communicate with other. The teacher and the students will communicate whether they are talking about the material during teaching and learning process. But, sometimes, many students are reluctant <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English</b> in classroom. Therefore, the students will be silent and not active in learning <b>English</b> especially in <b>speaking</b> activities. It can be hindered the students to participate in classroom interaction. However, there are some factors affecting students’ reluctance <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English,</b> they are : a) Psychological factor; b) Linguistic factor; c) Sociocultural factor. The research problems of the study are : (1) What factors are affecting the students’ reluctance <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English</b> in classroom interaction ? (2) What dominant factor is affecting the students’ reluctance <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English</b> in classroom interaction ? The objectives of the study are : (1) to investigate and to know the factors affecting the students’ reluctance <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English</b> in classroom interaction. (2) to know the dominant factors affecting students’ reluctance <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> Engish in classroom interaction. Research method and research subject : this research design uses survey research with a quantitative approach. The subjects of this research are 203 students who are divided into 5 classes. They are all the students of the second semester of English Department of IAIN Tulungagung in the Academic Year 2016 // 2017. The data about factors affecting the students’ reluctance <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English</b> in classroom interaction is collected by distributing questionnaire and conducting interview. Based on the result of data analysis gotten from questionnaire and interview shows that all the students have their own obstacles in speaking so that they are reluctant <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English</b> in classroom interaction. It is caused by three factors : psychological factor which has five categories that cause the students feel reluctant <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English,</b> they are : lack of motivation, shyness, anxiety, lack of confidence, and fear of mistake. While, linguistic factor has lack of vocabulary, lack of grammatical pattern knowledge, and incorrect pronunciation. Then, sociocultural factor consists of attitudes toward lecturer and classroom condition. Based on the questionnaires distributed to 203 students of second semester students of English Department reveals that psychological factor becomes the dominant factor affecting the students’ reluctance <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English</b> in classroom interaction since it is chosen by 99 of 203 students or 48, 8...|$|R

However, Ms. Davis’s apparent attempt to have these girls <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> in <b>English</b> {{did not seem to}} achieve its goal as the audio data revealed that soon after Ms. Davis’s comment, the students started speaking Korean again. They spoke quietly perhaps in order not to be heard by Ms. Davis. In an interview, Melody and other girls in this group said that even when teachers asked them <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English,</b> they still spoke in Korean. Melody explained, “We <b>speak</b> in <b>English</b> at first [when teachers tell us not <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> in Korean], but after that Korean just comes out again.” Ms. Davis’s demand <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English</b> did not encourage them <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> in <b>English,</b> but only discursively marked them as English learners with limited English proficiency.|$|R

40|$|Modals, Helping Verbs, English GrammarThis {{lesson was}} {{developed}} by John Nelson and Tymofey Wowk, 2012 Making English Grammar Meaningful and Useful Mini Lesson # 6 Modals: Helping Verbs with Meaning The purpose of this lesson is to demonstrate that Modals are like Helping Verbs with specific meanings. As demonstrated in Mini Lessons # 4 and # 5, Helping Verbs are used with their Main Verbs in English Verb Tenses. They have several grammatical purposes or functions, {{but they do not}} add semantic meaning to the sentences in which they are used. Modals are Helping Verbs with one additional feature. Modals add semantic meaning to the sentences in which they are used. To illustrate, consider the following 3 sentences: He does not <b>speak</b> <b>English.</b> He cannot <b>speak</b> <b>English</b> He should not <b>speak</b> <b>English.</b> In these 3 sentences, speak is the Main Verb; does, can and should are Helping Verbs. If these sentences are made into questions, does, can and should are all inverted with the subject, to form the questions. Does he <b>speak</b> <b>English?</b> Can he <b>speak</b> <b>English?</b> Should her <b>speak</b> <b>English?</b> In these sentences, does is used to make the sentences negative or to formulate the questions. However, it adds no semantic meaning to either. If you ask: “What is the meaning of ‘does’ in these sentences?” The answer is: “It has no meaning. ” However, the word can has the meaning of ability. The question with ‘can’ asks if he has the ability <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English</b> and in the negative sentence ‘can’ informs us that he does not have the ability <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English.</b> Similarly, the word should has the meaning of importance or appropriateness. In the question ‘should’ asks if it is appropriate or important <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English,</b> and in the negative sentence the word ‘should’ informs us that it is not important or appropriate <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English.</b> English has nine commonly used MODALS: will would shall should may might can could must Unlike Helping Verbs, Modals are not used to show the kind of tense; on their own they do not show past, present or future time; and they do not change form to show agreement with their subjects. However, they are used with, and are often contracted with, not in negative sentences, and they are inverted with subjects to form questions. In this regard they do function like Helping Verbs, as shown above. Also, like Helping Verbs, Modals are used in short answers, they are used in tag questions, they are used to express agreement or disagreement, they are used in questions of surprise or doubt, and they are stressed in sentences to show emphasis. This lesson {{was developed by}} John Nelson and Tymofey Wowk, 2012 Two other expressions are often considered to be Modals: ought to and have to. ‘Ought to’ has the same meaning as ‘should’ and ‘have to’ has the same meaning as ‘must’. However, their structures are slightly different from the Modals presented above because they both include the word ‘to’. Except for the ‘to’, ‘ought’ is used like the other Modals as shown in these sentences: He ought <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English.</b> Ought he <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English?</b> He ought not <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English.</b> The Modal, ought, is like the other Modals except that it is followed by the TO Form of the Main Verb. The Modal have to is different still as shown in these sentences: He has <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English.</b> Does he have <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English?</b> He doesn’t have <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>English.</b> The Modal have to is used like a Main Verb, requiring the Helping Verb ‘DO’ when used in questions or negative sentences. The most difficult aspect of modals is the meanings that they convey. They are used to make polite requests, indicate ability, suggest possibilities, and offer advice to mention a few of their meanings. Modals provide problems for the learner because most of their meanings can be expressed by more than one modal, and each modal can be used to express more than one meaning...|$|R
