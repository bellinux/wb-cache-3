50|$|The first {{commercial}} <b>non-impact</b> <b>printer</b> was the Xerox 1200, introduced in 1973, {{based on the}} 3600 copier. It had an optical character generator designed by optical engineer Phil Chen.|$|R
40|$|In digital printing, {{an image}} is sent {{directly}} to the printer using digital files such as PDFs from graphic software such as Illustrator and In Design. This {{eliminates the need for}} a printing plate, which is used in offset printing, which can save money and time. The digital printing can be classified in to mainly four categories 	Silver halide process 	Inkjet technology 	Thermal printing 	Electro photography <b>Non-impact</b> <b>printers</b> print characters and images without any physical contact between the Printing mechanism and the paper. <b>Non-impact</b> <b>printers</b> are generally much quieter than impact printers since they don't physically strike the page...|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, Centronics {{formed a}} {{relationship}} with Canon to develop <b>non-impact</b> <b>printers.</b> No products were ever produced, but Canon continued to work on laser printers, eventually developing a highly successful series of engines.|$|R

5000|$|In 1971, as IBM created IBM Japan Development Laboratory, Nobuo Mii {{became its}} Technical Operations director, working in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, {{and lead the}} project to develop IBM 3767 <b>printer</b> <b>terminal,</b> using the new Systems Network Architecture {{communications}} protocol.|$|R
50|$|Impact {{printers}} create noise {{when the}} pins or typeface strike the ribbon to the paper, and sound-damping enclosures {{may have to}} be used in quiet environments. They can only print lower-resolution graphics, with limited color performance, limited quality, and lower speeds compared to <b>non-impact</b> <b>printers.</b> While they support fanfold paper with tractor holes well, single-sheet paper {{may have to be}} wound in and aligned by hand, which is relatively time-consuming, or a sheet feeder may be utilized which can have a lower paper feed reliability. When printing labels on release paper, they are prone to paper jams when a print wire snags {{the leading edge of the}} label while printing at its very edge. For text-only labels (e.g. mailing labels), a daisy wheel printer or band printer may offer better print quality and a lower risk of damaging the paper.|$|R
50|$|In 1973, Millard founded IMS Associates, {{which is}} most famous for IMSAI 8080 {{microcomputer}} first shipped in late 1975. By 1977, IMSAI's product line included <b>printers,</b> <b>terminals,</b> floppy diskettes and software. To finance rapidly growing operations, IMSAI pledged 20% of its stock as convertible note in exchange for $250,000 from investment firm Marriner & Co.|$|R
50|$|IBM 3767 Communication Terminal is {{a serial}} <b>printer</b> <b>terminal</b> that {{employed}} wire matrix print-head technology and, {{for the first}} time, the Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) communications protocol set under IBM's Systems Network Architecture(SNA). It was introduced in 1974 and was used widely during the late 1970s to 1990s, for attachment to IBM System/360 and System/370 mainframe computers and IBM System/7 as a 2741 terminal.|$|R
50|$|Because the new {{minicomputer}} systems required inexpensive operator consoles (compared to teletype <b>printers),</b> the <b>terminals</b> {{became a}} success.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1960 and 1970s, the {{computing}} environment expanded beyond the large computer rooms based on card input/output {{and started to}} allow data input and output terminals from remote locations. For such purposes, <b>printer</b> <b>terminals</b> such as IBM 2741 printer, using the traditional asynchronous serial communication (start-stop signaling), and display terminals such as IBM 2260 and IBM 3270, using the new communications protocol set (Binary Synchronous Communications or BSC), became available.|$|R
40|$|Use {{of color}} in the office and {{business}} environment is growing rapidly. In the 90 s, color is becoming easier and less expensive to use and its application is moving from isolated color pages toward integrated color documents. Moreover, in parallel with this trend, color in documents is driving a paradigm shift from a text orientation to a pictorial and graphic one. Business applications cover a range of quality requirements for both full and highlight color documents. <b>Non-impact</b> <b>printers</b> for these applications are being manufactured based on numerous technologies, including xerography, thermal transfer, ink jet, thermal dye diffusion and even photography. We compare and contrast these technologies in terms of characteristics such as registration, image structure, color gamut, and stability. We then consider the systems impact of customer requirements such as ease of use and consistency of results across printers, demonstrating a need to hide the printer technologies and their differences from the system users. A need for standards in both the description of color documents in device independent form and in other aspects such as viewing conditions is discussed in this context. 2...|$|R
2500|$|Unix had a {{drastically}} simplified {{file model}} compared to many contemporary operating systems: treating {{all kinds of}} files as simple byte arrays. The file system hierarchy contained machine services and devices (such as <b>printers,</b> <b>terminals,</b> or disk drives), providing a uniform interface, but {{at the expense of}} occasionally requiring additional mechanisms such as ioctl and mode flags to access features of the hardware that did not fit the simple [...] "stream of bytes" [...] model. The Plan 9 operating system pushed this model even further and eliminated the need for additional mechanisms.|$|R

5000|$|... nroff (short for [...] "new roff") is a Unix text-formatting program. It {{produces}} output {{suitable for}} simple fixed-width <b>printers</b> and <b>terminal</b> windows. It {{is an integral}} part of the Unix help system, being used to format man pages for display.|$|R
50|$|During {{initial program}} load (IPL) of current MVS systems, the Nucleus Initialization Program (NIP) reads {{necessary}} information from the I/O Definition File (IODF) and uses it to build the UCBs. The UCBs are stored in system-owned memory, in the Extended System Queue Area (ESQA). After IPL completes, UCBs are owned by Input/Output Support. Some of the information stored in the UCB are: device type (disk, tape, <b>printer,</b> <b>terminal,</b> etc.), address of the device (such as 1002), subchannel identifier and device number, channel path ID (CHPID) which defines {{the path to the}} device, for some devices the volume serial number (VOLSER), and a large amount of other information, including OS Job Management data.|$|R

It connects devices (such as <b>printers,</b> <b>terminals,</b> PCs, and modems) to local area networks (LANs). The DECserver 708 is Ethernet-based and supports 10BaseT Ethernet directly, and ThinWire Ethernet/IEEE 802.3 through an adapter. It supports Flash RAM capability and other nonvolatile forms of memory. The memory capability is factory installed. The Flash RAM is optional. The DECserver 708 can download the software image from the network or from the Flash RAM option if installed. The Flash RAM option allows for a boot/power up without having to download the image through the network. The DECserver 708 supports up to 4 MB of memory.|$|R
5000|$|The Teletype Dataspeed 40 {{combined}} electronic CRTs {{and high}} speed <b>printer</b> <b>terminals</b> and were networked {{in many different}} applications {{through the use of}} [...] "cluster controllers" [...] and digital data service units. The Dataspeed 40 interfaced a synchronous modem usually running at 2400, 4800 or 9600 baud. The trademarked term [...] "Dataspeed" [...] originated with a series of high speed paper tape terminals that sent and received oil-treated punched paper tape at 1050 words per minute. AT&T used the Dataspeed 40 terminals internally for their Switching Control Center System and similar purposes. The Dataspeed 40 was also sold commercially and used for a variety of purposes and displaced some older and slower speed Teletype equipment.|$|R
