The {{concept of the}} game, which combined the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> role-playing games with the allure of Choose Your Own Adventure books, was seen initially as a positive, and the gameplay was considered a cross between Bastion and Star Fox. However, the game's combat system, though considered very fluid similar to the Batman: Arkham Asylum game, was very repetitive with very little variation {{in the types of}} enemies or the range of moves that Reynardo could complete. Further, because the player must play through the game several times to get the right ending, this further highlighted the limited range of combat options, making the overall title seem dull.|$|E
50|$|Due to the all-or-nothing <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> potentials, single spikes {{can only}} encode {{information}} in their interspike intervals (ISI). This is an inherently low fidelity method of transferring information as {{it depends on}} very accurate timing and is sensitive to noisy loss of signal: if just a single spike is mistimed or not properly received at the synapse it leads to a possibly unrecoverable loss in coding. Since intrinsic bursts {{are thought to be}} derived by a computational mechanism in the slow subsystem, each can represent a much larger amount of information in the specific shape of a single burst leading to far more robust transmission. Physiological models show that for a given input the interspike and interburst timings are much more variable than the timing of the burst shape itself which also implies that timing between events is a less robust way to encode information.|$|E
5000|$|This theory, {{put forward}} by German {{scientist}} Wolfgang Prinz and his colleagues from the Max Planck Institute, claims parity between perception and action. Its core assumption is that actions are coded {{in terms of the}} perceivable effects (i.e., the distal perceptual events) they should generate. [...] This theory also states that perception of an action should activate action representations to the degree that the perceived and the represented action are similar. [...] Such a claim suggests that we represent observed, executed and imagined actions in a commensurate manner and makes specific predictions regarding the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> and perceptual representations. First, representations for observed and executed actions should rely on a shared neural substrate. Second, a common cognitive system predicts facilitation of action based on directly prior perception and vice versa. Third, such a system predicts interference effects when action and perception attempt to access shared representations simultaneously.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to provide}} a survey of periphrastic aspectual constructions in contemporary European Portuguese. The research was initially conducted on periphrastic constructions in the two main Portuguese corpuses, the CETEMPúblico and the Corpus do Portugus, and was then followed by a semantic analysis. The main problem, according to the author, consists in the fundamentally different conceptions of aspect and the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> verbal <b>action</b> in Czech and Portuguese. Given that the grammatical category of aspect has different contents in Czech and Portuguese, it is preferable {{to use the term}} aspectuality as a three-layer system of interacting categories of aspect, telicity, and the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> verbal <b>action.</b> If the traditional Slavic aspect is to be expressed in Portuguese by other means at various levels of construction, Czech lacks a way to render the variety of meanings of Portuguese periphrastic constructions that represent the different categories <b>of</b> the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> verbal <b>action</b> (Aktionsart). In the dissertation, aspectuality in Portuguese is considered a system of mutually correlated categories - aspect, the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> verbal <b>action,</b> and the lexical semantics of the verb.

5000|$|Prinz is {{the father}} of the common coding theory. This theory claims parity between {{perception}} and action. Its core assumption is that actions are coded in terms of the perceivable effects (i.e., the distal perceptual events) they should generate Performing a movement leaves behind a bidirectional association between the motor pattern it has generated by and the sensory effects that it produces. Such an association can then be used backwards to retrieve a movement by anticipating its effects. [...] These perception/action codes are also accessible during action observation (for an historical account of the ideo-motor principle, see Observation of an action should activate action representations to the degree that the perceived and the represented action are similar.

40|$|Sittlichkeit” (siveellisyys) {{is one of}} the key {{concepts}} used by Finnish women’s rights activists when they in the beginning of 20 th century demanded the rights for political participation. But how is the term siveellisyys, the meaning of which a modern Finnish reader easily connects with prudish sexual morality, related to political participation and suffrage? I argue that in the Finnish suffragists’ argumentation for the vote the term has a clear public and political dimension, which can be best understood through the concept of Sittlichkeit as it appears in Johan Vilhelm Snellman's political philosophy influenced by Hegel’s system of concepts, referring to the political <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> and getting a meaning close to “civic”. I will focus on explicating the interplay of two of the meanings that the term siveellisyys gets in women's texts: that of the Snellmanian idea of the political <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> and that of pure sexual morality. I argue that on one hand suffragists use the term siveellisyys similarly to the Snellmanian concept of Sittlichkeit to enable women to be considered as political actors and to construct an idea of political action which they contrast to party politics. On the other hand, in its meaning related to sexual ethics, the term siveellisyys is used to indicate that not all women are capable for political action...|$|E
