Micro nozzles whose exit diameter d= 3 μm are {{mounted on a}} thin metal film. The number of the micro nozzles is from 2. 0 × 10 ^ 4 to 1. 2 × 10 ^ 5. Using an ultrasonic oscillator, gasoline is periodically pushed out from the micro nozzles at a frequency from 62 to 65 kHz. A disk type PZT is used as an ultrasonic oscillator, and the oscillation is amplified using a step-type horn. The input voltage to the PZT is varied from 0 to 200 V. To increase the fuel flow rate, the horn small end diameter Ds is increased from 10. 5 to 25 mm, while the large end diameter is fixed at 30 mm. To prevent forming a liquid film on the micro <b>nozzle</b> <b>array,</b> gutters are machined on the small end of the horn.

In {{order to facilitate}} micro heat transfer measurements with these devices, a MEMS sensor chip, which has an 8 x 8 temperature-sensor array on one side, and an integrated heater {{on the other side}} has been designed and fabricated. This sensor chip allows 2 -D surface temperature measurement with various jets impinging on it. It is found that micro impinging jets can be highly efficient when compared to existing macro impinging-jet microelectronics packages such as IBM 4381. For example, using a single nozzle jet (500 -μm diameter driven by 5 psig pressure), the sensor chip (2 x 2 cm^ 2) temperature can be cooled down from 70 to 33 °C. The cooling becomes more efficient when <b>nozzle</b> <b>arrays</b> (4 x 5 over 1 cm^ 2 area) are used under the same driving pressure.

In addition, the plasma jets were able to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which function as surrogate apoptotic signals by targeting the mitochondrial membrane potential. Antioxidants or caspase inhibitors ameliorated the apoptotic cell death induced by the air and N 2 plasma jets, suggesting that the plasma jet may generate ROS as a proapoptotic cue, thus initiating mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.

40|$|The {{preparation}} of water-in-oil emulsions with silicon nitride microfluidic <b>nozzle</b> <b>arrays</b> requires a surface, {{which is not}} wetted by the continuous water phase. Hence, we deposited several hydrophobic coatings on silicon nitride and studied the wetting behavior of water in pure and emulsifier containing hexadecane. In pure medias we could demonstrate that an octyl-chain terminated is the optimal hydrophobic coating. It has a high affinity to hexadecane due to its similar chemical nature expressed by a very low solid/liquid interfacial tension and a low affinity to water resulting in the highest measured water in hexadecane contact angle of 164 °. Unmodified silicon nitride in contrast has the highest affinity to water and the lowest to hexadecane resulting in a contact angle of 97 °. Based on {{the determination of the}} solid/liquid interfacial tensions in pure liquids we found for several hydrophobic coatings and for unmodified silicon nitride a deviation from Young's equation, which can be related to negative Hamaker constants of the studied systems. With the soybean-based emulsifier BolecMT we observed for several coatings no negative influence of the adsorbed emulsifier on the hydrophobicity. In fact, the water/hexadecane contact angles increased in time. In case of unmodified silicon nitride the surface was rendered into a more hydrophobic state. For low surface energy coatings, we observed a dramatic time-dependent change of the wetting characteristics. After {{a certain period of time}} water drops collapsed and wetted the surface. The time scales of this observed wetting behavior is several magnitudes larger than the drop formation process itself. Therefore, its relevance for the drop formation process could be neglected.

Such experimental study has yielded fundamental understanding and practical design guidelines of these two microfluidic applications. Novel MEMS devices fabricated include temperature imagers, MEMS <b>nozzles</b> and <b>nozzle</b> <b>arrays,</b> and micro fluidic couplers. A technology for suspended microchannels with integrated polysilicon thermistors has been developed and used for microchannel flow study and flow-rate sensing. Theoretical models {{have been developed to}} analyze such micro thermal and fluidic phenomena. In the micro impinging jet cooling study, a MEMS-based heat transfer measurement paradigm has been successfully developed for the first time. This includes technology for MEMS device fabrication, an experimental setup well suited for microscale thermal study, and accurate and efficient data processing techniques. Sensing and heating are integrated into a single thermal imager chip, which allows temperature measurement over a large area at very high spatial resolution. The heat transfer data demonstrate the excellent promise of micro-impinging-jet heat transfer, and provide useful rules for designing impinging-jet-based micro heat exchangers for IC packages. In the investigation of micro channel flow, suspended microchannels with integrated thermistors have successfully been designed and fabricated to study the basic science of micro-scale channel flow. Considerable discrepancies between existing theory and experimental data have been observed, and an improved flow model that accounts for the effects of compressibility, boundary slip, fluid acceleration, non-parabolic fluid velocity profile and channel-wall bulging has been proposed to address such discrepancies. In addition, micro fluidic couplers have been designed and fabricated as the fluidic interface connection between micro fluidic systems and the external macro environment. The experiments show that MEMS couplers are capable of handling pressures as high as 1200 psig. Finally, this thesis presents the development of liquid flow sensors.

Analysis of the shock motion revealed that the shock wave becomes more unstable as it becomes stronger, as evidenced by an increase in the range of motion and in the frequency of large-scale oscillations. For strong shocks, there is a substantial correlation between shock motion and total pressure fluctuation in the plume. Such correlation is absent for relatively weak shocks. The study indicates that shock motion affects the plume instability if the separation shock is very strong, and that other mechanisms govern the plume instability when the shock is relatively weak.

40|$|Most Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) are {{primarily}} created using integrated circuit (IC) fabrication techniques and photolithography. These techniques and procedures are time consuming and exhaustive {{in the amount}} of steps needed in their creation. Also, fabrication processes often limit the materials, chemicals, and temperatures allowed throughout the extensive creation process in order to ensure cross compatibility with all materials in the device. As such, compromises to optimal design are common in many current commercial MEMS products. Current processes and manufacturing techniques are also very expensive. Elastomeric transfer printing offers solutions to these challenges by introducing the ability to assemble individual modularized components of these devices. Transfer printing frees fabricators to simplify and optimize the creation process by breaking down the devices into unique individual parts. Transfer printing also allows for the use of a wider field of materials as well as the ability to use previously incompatible chemicals, temperatures, and other process parameters in pursuit of perfecting each part individually before final assembly. These parts can then be assembled individually or in an assembly line fashion at potentially a significant decrease in manufacturing cost. This thesis examines three examples of transfer printed MEMS that span the areas of microfluidics, mechatronic, and optical/thermal. The microfluidic example is silicon microfluidic nozzles printed onto PDMS microchannels as a means to create simple modularized micro <b>nozzle</b> <b>arrays.</b> This process vastly cuts down on the steps needed to fabricate traditional MEMS Microfluidic nozzles as well as offers a means to potentially exchange damaged nozzles from existing microfluidics arrays. For the mechatronic area, silicon micro gears are transfer printed onto silicon shafts. These gears then demonstrated interdependent actuation. Transfer printing gears allows MEMS designers new flexibility in micro mechatronic design that was previously limited due to photolithography processes. Lastly, for the optical thermal example, microbolometers are created and transfer printed onto a read-out test bed. Bolometers are {{a good example of the}} potential of modularized assembly of 3 D MEMS. These devices are resistance-based sensing devices found at the heart of infrared thermal imaging devices. One critical parameter in a microbolometer membrane is the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) which is a measure of the bolometer’s sensitivity. Optimally, the TCR should be as negative as possible. Bolometers with a TCR of around - 2 %/°C are common in industry today and are fabricated directly on the readout integrated circuit (ROIC) which limits the thermal processing that can be done to optimize the bolometer membrane due to the risk of damaging the readout integrated circuit (ROIC). A solution to this problem is to fabricate the bolometer membranes separate from the ROIC, then combine them using transfer printing. Separating the processes allows for the use of high temperature annealing to be performed on the bolometer membrane that would have otherwise damaged the ROIC. This annealing allows the vanadium oxide in the membranes to achieve a much lower TCR of up to - 4 %/°C. Transfer printing then provides a unique method for assembling the bolometer membrane on the ROIC. Transfer printing is a means for the optimization of MEMS assembly because it removes previous design constraints on MEMS creation and allows manufacturers to modularly and optimally create and assemble MEMS components into enhanced integrated devices...|$|R

Results for both the degassed and gassy cases show that structure width and separation distance have a dominant effect upon the heat transfer for the size ranges used. Cubic pin fin height had little impact upon heat flux. The maximum critical heat flux (CHF) attained for any of the surfaces was 121 W/sq cm, giving an enhancement of 51 % relative to the flat surface case under nominally degassed conditions.

40|$|Quenching {{of heated}} {{surfaces}} through impinging liquid jets {{is of great}} im-portance for numerous applications like steel processing, nuclear power plants, automobile industries, etc. Therefore, computational modelling of the surface quenching through circular water jets impinging normally onto a heated flat surface has vital importance in order to reveal the physics of the quenching process. At first, a numerical model was developed for single jet impingement process. A conjugate heat transfer problem was solved implying consideration of both regions, one occupied by fluid (multi-phase flow consisting of water, vapor and ambient air) and one accommodating the solid surface within the same solution domain. Numerical simulations were performed {{in a range of}} relevant operating param-eters: jet velocities (2. 5, 5, 7. 5 and 10 m/s), water sub-cooling (75 K) and wall-superheat (650 K - 800 K) corresponding closely to those encountered in the industrial water jet cooling banks. Due to the high initial temperature of the surface, the boiling process exhibits strong spatial and temporal fluctuations. Its effect on the boundary layer profiles at the stagnation region at different time intervals are analyzed. The analysis reveals a highly distorted field of both mean flow and turbulence quantities. It represents an im-portant outcome, also with respect to appropriate model improvements. The different boiling characteristics are envisaged in detail to increase the level of understanding of the phenomena. The influence of the turbulent kinetic energy investigated at the boiling front as well as the jet-acceleration region has been studied. The physically relevant results are obtained and analyzed along with reference database provided experimentally by Karwa (2012, ‘Experimental Study of Water Jet Impingement Cooling of Hot Steel Plates,' Dissertation, FG TTD, TU Darmstadt). The intensive quenching process is consistent with the high rate of sub-cooling and high jet velocities. The surface temperature predicted by quenching model within the impingement region and the subsequent wall-jet region agrees reasonably well with the measurements, the outcome being particularly valid at higher jet velocities. However, a steep temperature gradient at the position corresponding to boiling threshold has not been captured under the condition of the numerical grid adopted. On the other hand, a reasonably good prediction of the wetting front propagation phenomena advocates the future development of the model. The high-intensity back motion of the vapor phase in the stagnation region at the earlier times of the water jet impingement can induce an appropriately high turbulence level, which could be accounted well by the turbulence model applied. The second part of the present work deals with multiple liquid jet impingement. When the multiple jets impact onto the heated surface, the heat flux is extracted from the surface by the mass flow rate. The heat flux is dependent on the several flow conditions and configurations of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>array</b> system. Therefore, one needs to study the <b>nozzle</b> <b>array</b> configuration along with several flow parameters for the better design of the cooling header system. Accordingly, the hydrodynamics of the multiple jets has been studied computationally realizing the need for optimum configuration of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>array.</b> The effects of the mass flow rate, target plate width and the turbulence produced due to the impingement were studied. Afterward, an analytical model is proposed for the quenching of the multiple jets system. It has been realized that, when jet impinges onto the surface at very high initial temperature, the film boiling {{may play a role in}} the heat transfer mechanism. Therefore, development has been made in the film-boiling model considering the effect of turbulence at the liquid jet stagnation region at the Leidenfrost point. The Leidenfrost point is the minimum temperature at which the film boiling can sustain. However, the vapor-liquid interface has the dynamic character; it oscillates with high frequency and causes the additional momentum diffusivity. Therefore, the need for introducing the effect of associated turbulence has been felt. The length and velocity scale of the turbulent structure has been approximated by assuming homogeneous turbulence. The new model for the heat flux and wall superheat yielded results agreeing well with published experimental results...|$|E
30|$|Electrospinning of photopatternable {{polymers}} {{allows for}} direct patterning of the nanofibers using UV lithography of the nanofibers. Norbornene based co-polymer PN 3 TMA 6 with photocrosslinkable units (methacrylate) [19] and Polyethylene oxide (PEO) with photo initiator (Irgacure) in hyaluronic acid [20] have been reported. Recently, multiple groups including the author group have reported on electrospinning and subsequent photopatterning using commercially available SU- 8 [7, 21 – 24]. Patterned nanofibers have been subsequently carbonized after thermal treatment, resulting in good electrodes for high density energy storage {{devices such as}} supercapacitors [7, 21, 22]. While the process has large commercial implications in context of nanomanufacturing, so far only a single spinneret approach has been exercised. Recently, the authors have presented the tube nozzle electrospinning (TNE) process [8]. In this paper, the TNE process is described in detail as a high throughput nanofiber fabrication process using a commercially available photopatternable epoxy SU- 8 and the photolithographical patterning of the SU- 8 nanofibers is detailed. In TNE, low density polyethylene (LDPE) tubes are adopted and a linear <b>nozzle</b> <b>array</b> has been formed using a computer numerical control (CNC) printed circuit board (PCB) milling machine. The semi vertical angle due to electrostatic repulsion between nozzles, the nanofiber diameter, the nanofiber production throughput and the growth rate {{as a function of}} the nozzle count, and photopatterning the electrospun nanofiber stacks are detailed.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} boundary layer transition in a multi-stage turbine {{has been completed}} using surface-mounted hot-film sensors. Tests were carried out using the two-stage Low Speed Research Turbine of the Aerodynamics Research Laboratory of GE Aircraft Engines. Blading in this facility models current, state-of-the-art low pressure turbine configurations. The instrumentation technique involved arrays of densely-packed hot-film sensors on the surfaces of second stage rotor and <b>nozzle</b> blades. The <b>arrays</b> were located at mid-span on both the suction and pressure surfaces. Boundary layer measurements were acquired over a complete range of relevant Reynolds numbers. Data acquisition capabilities provided means for detailed data interrogation in both time and frequency domains. Data indicate that significant regions of laminar and transitional boundary layer flow exist on the rotor and nozzle suction surfaces. Evidence of relaminarization both near {{the leading edge of}} the suction surface and along much of the pressure surface was observed. Measurements also reveal the nature of the turbulent bursts occuring within and between the wake segments convecting through the blade row. The complex character of boundary layer transition resulting from flow unsteadiness due to nozzle/nozzle, rotor/nozzle, and nozzle/rotor wake interactions are elucidated using these data. These measurements underscore the need to provide turbomachinery designers with models of boundary layer transition to facilitate accurate prediction of aerodynamic loss and heat transfer...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a study of heat {{transfer}} coefficient for multi – jet air impinging cooling. Research and development for enhancement heat transfer using multi – jet air impinging cooling system shows variety possibilities. The required performance must be achieved in other to boost user satisfaction. The main objectives of this thesis are to study the effect of heat transfer coefficient by multi – jet impinging cooling system, and define {{the relationship between the}} heat transfer coefficient with the jet flow and the distance from exit nozzle to the heat source. The thesis described the methodology utilize and the result comparison among the jet used. Single, 4, and 9 jet nozzles with constant nozzle diameter, 4 mm were studied in this thesis with different jet flow and also various exit nozzle to heat source spacing. The heat source plate is constant at 100 ℃. Compressed Air as the coolant medium at room temperature with laminar flow at nozzle exit was studied along with 500, 950, 1960 and 2300 Reynolds numbers. From the results, it is observed that the experiment data using 9 jet <b>array</b> <b>nozzle</b> produced the highest Nusselt number in the range of 95 ℃ to 105 ℃ correspond to low temperature distribution due to many stagnation point formed. This shows the most efficient cooling system. The graph pattern shows the maximum and minimum point {{in view of the fact}} that there are many stagnation points. However, the single jet and 4 jet nozzle produced low Nusselt number. The Nusselt number graph trend is linearly decreased for single jet and linearly increased for 4 jet nozzle. The results concluded that the additional number of nozzle with higher Reynolds number and narrow spacing of exit nozzle to heat source plate being used, the more efficient performance produced. More stagnation point created during the impingement on the heat source will produced more effective cooling system. The experiment results are significant to improve the overheat component problem nowadays. The results can also significantly increase the performance of the needed component in order to improve product reliability and customer confidence...|$|R
40|$|Unconfined {{multiple}} interacting confluent round jets {{are interesting}} from a purely scientific point of view, as interaction between neighboring jets brings additional complexity to the flow field. Unconfined confluent round jets also exist in various engineering applications, such as ventilation supply devices, sewage disposal systems, combustion burners, chemical mixing or chimney stacks. Even so, little scientific {{attention has been}} paid to unconfined confluent round jets. The present work uses both advanced measurement techniques and computational models to provide deeper understanding of the turbulent flow field development of unconfined confluent round jets. Both Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) have been used to measure mean velocity and turbulence properties within two setups, consisting of a single row of 1 × 6 jets and a square array of 6 × 6 confluent jets. Simulations using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of the 6 × 6 setup were conducted using three different Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models: the standard k-ε, the RNG k-ε and the Reynolds Stress model (RSM). The results from the CFD simulations were compared with experimental data. The employed RANS turbulence models were all capable of accurately predicting mean velocities and turbulent properties in the investigated confluent jet array. In general the RSM and k-ε std. models provided smaller deviations between numerical and experimental results than the RNG k-ε model. In terms of mean velocity the second-order closure model (RSM) was not found to be superior to the less complex standard k-ε model. The validated CFD model was employed in a parametrical investigation, including five independent variables: inlet velocity, nozzle diameter, nozzle edge-to-edge spacing, nozzle height and the number of jets in the array. The parametrical investigations made use of statistical methods in the form of response surface methodology. The derived response surface models provided information on the principal influence and relative importance of the investigated parameters within the investigated design space. The positions of the jets within the array strongly influence both mean velocity and turbulence. In all investigated setups the jets experience merging and combining. Square arrays also include considerable jet convergence, which was not present in the 1 × 6 jet array. Due to the jet convergence in square arrays the turbulent flow field, especially for jets far away from the array center, is affected by mean flow curvature. Jets located along the sides of square jet arrays experience strong jet-to-jet interactions that result in considerable jet deformation, shorter potential core, higher turbulent kinetic energy and faster velocity decay compared to other jets. Jets located at the corners of the array do not interact as strongly with neighboring jets as do the jets along the sides. The locations of merging and combined points differ considerably between different jets and different jet configurations. As the jets combine a zone with uniform stream-wise velocity and low turbulence intensity forms in the center of square jet arrays. This zone has been called Confluent Core Zone (CCZ) due to its similarities with the potential core zone of a single jet. Within the CCZ the appropriate scaling length changes from nozzle diameter to the effective source diameter. The parametrical investigation showed that nozzle diameter and edge-to-edge nozzle spacing were the most important of the investigated parameters, reflecting a strong dependence on dimensionless jet spacing, S/d 0. Higher S/d 0 delays both merging and combining of the jets and leads to a CCZ with lower velocity and longer downstream extension. Increasing the array size leads to a reduced combined point distance, a stronger inwards displacement of jets in the outer part of the array, and reduced entrainment near the nozzles. A higher inlet velocity was found to increase the jet convergence in the investigated square confluent jet <b>arrays.</b> <b>Nozzle</b> height generally has minor impact on the investigated response variables...|$|R
