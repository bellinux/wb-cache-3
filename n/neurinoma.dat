40|$|<b>Neurinomas</b> are {{the most}} common type of tumor that cause {{medullary}} compression at the cervical level. About 15 % of all cervical <b>neurinomas</b> have extradural and extraspinal extension. Their resection raises the problems of nerve root preservation, vertebral artery control and spinal stability. Three patients with cervical <b>neurinomas</b> with significant exstraspinal components are presented in this report. They all had raducular pains and signs of medullary compression. Preoperative neuroimaging revealed cervical intraspinal and extramedullary mass with extraspinal extension. Complete tumor resection was achieved in all three patients by using staged posterior and anterolateral approach. Postoperative results were favorable.

50|$|Schwannomas {{are mostly}} benign tumors that {{commonly}} occur in individuals with NF2 and schwannomatosis (sometimes called neurofibromatosis type III). Schwann cells are glial cells that myelinate the axons of nerve cells. Myelin is a lipid covering that speeds the conduction of action potentials. When Schwann cells proliferate {{out of control}} in an encapsulation it is called a schwannoma. Although schwannomas are benign they become detrimental when the growing tumor compresses the nerve. Schwannomas on sensory nerve axons cause chronic severe pain. Treatment options for schwannomas are to surgically remove them, have radiation, cyberknife or Intracapsular Enucleation. Previous designations for schwannomas include <b>neurinoma</b> and neurilemmoma.|$|E
50|$|It is now {{apparent}} that RBD appears {{in association with}} a variety of different conditions. Narcolepsy has been reported as a related disorder. Both RBD and narcolepsy involve dissociation of sleep states probably arising from a disruption of sleep control mechanisms. RBD has also been reported following cerebrovascular accident and <b>neurinoma</b> (tumor), indicating that damage to the brain stem area may precipitate RBD. RBD is usually chronic. However, it may be acute and sudden in onset if associated with drug treatment or withdrawal (particularly with alcohol withdrawal). 60% of RBD is idiopathic. This includes RBD that is found in association with conditions such as Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, where it is often seen to precede the onset of neurodegenerative disease. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and noradrenergic antagonists can induce or aggravate RBD symptoms and should be avoided in patients with RBD.|$|E

The surgical approach was retrosigmoid/ trasmeatal and the goal was total removal in one procedure with preservation of facial and cochlear nerves. Radical removal of lesion was attempted in 79 cases and it was possible in 77 patients. Subtotal tumor resection was planned in 2 cases.

40|$|CSF {{rhinorrhea}} is {{a common}} complication of acoustic <b>neurinoma</b> surgery via the suboccipital route. In this paper we present our incidence of CSF rhinorrhea and our surgical techniques for {{reducing the risk of}} this post-surgical complication. Following removal of the acoustic <b>neurinoma,</b> the drilled posterior wall of the internal auditory canal is covered with bonewax, muscle or fat pieces, and fibrin-glue, while the previously reflected dura is sutured in place keeping the packing material in position. Bone chips removed during the craniectomy are then mixed with fibric glue and are used for a cranioplasty. Although we routinely perform aggressive drilling of internal auditory canal to facilitate total removal of the acoustic <b>neurinoma,</b> only 1 out of 94 consecutive cases (1 %) showed postoperative CSF rhinorrhea. Since previous reports mention the rate of this complication following acoustic <b>neurinoma</b> surgery varies between 4 % and 27 %, we believe that our methods may be useful in helping reduce the incidence of postoperative rhinorrhea...|$|E

40|$|<b>Neurinomas</b> {{arising from}} the trigeminal nerve are rare (0. 1 - 0. 4 % of {{intracranial}} rumours; 1 - 8 % of all intracranial <b>neurinomas).</b> A series of 111 trigeminal <b>neurinomas</b> operated on at the Institute of Neurosurgery 'N. N. Burdenko' of Moscow, Russia, during the period 1961 - 1994 is presented. Clinical features, diagnostic radiology, surgery and results of treatment are discussed. We distinguished four groups of trigeminal neurinomas: a) Posterior fossa tumours; b) Tumours of the Gasserian ganglion; c) 'Dumb-bell' supra-subtentorial tumours; d) <b>Neurinomas</b> of the peripheral branches. The complex clinical symptomatology {{is related to the}} actual location of the lesion. Surgery of trigeminal <b>neurinomas</b> may be very difficult, particularly in cases of dump-bell supra-subtentorial lesions. In this series, 3 cases died postoperatively. Out of the 108 patients surviving surgery, long-term follow-up (min. 13 months, max. 33 years, average 13. 5 years) was available in 98 cases. 84 patients (86. 7 %) showed good-to excellent results, with partial trigeminal deficit as the only surgical sequela. 13 patients (11. 7 %) had a symptomatic recurrence following incomplete tumour removal. Second surgery, ranging from 1. 4 to 9 years (average 3. 8 years) following the first operation, was judged radical in 9 cases (69. 2), however, the rate of complications of repeated surgery was higher than that occurring after the first operation.

40|$|We {{applied a}} cranio-orbital-zygomatic {{approach}} that extends the temporal craniotomy more posteriorly and minimizes the frontal orbitotomy {{of an ordinary}} orbitozygomatic approach {{in order to provide}} wide access to the already eroded petrous apices along the long axis of trigeminal <b>neurinomas.</b> We treated seven dumbbell-shaped trigeminal <b>neurinomas</b> between 1991 and 1998 (mean follow-up, 38 months; range, 9 to 109 months). The configuration of the tumor mass was assessed on magnetic resonance imaging by measuring its long diameter in the middle and posterior fossae and the width of petrous erosion. Tumors were then classified into five types based on their distribution over the petrous ridge. Total removal was achieved in six patients, who showed no evidence of tumor recurrence during the follow-up period. The only major complication was one case of anesthesia dolorosa. The one patient with a subtotal removal developed a recurrence 12 months after surgery, in the posterior fossa. The cranioorbital-zygomatic approach could be an effective method for removing dumbbell-shaped trigeminal <b>neurinomas,</b> particularly in cases of wide petrous erosion from the tumor. If, however, the tumor has a larger posterior fossa component, this approach may not provide adequate exposure to achieve a total resection...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Spinal metastases are {{frequently}} encountered {{in patients with}} breast cancer. Because of recent improvements in oncologic therapies a growing incidence of symptomatic leptomeningeal metastases (LM) should be expected. The differential diagnosis of LM comprises {{a wide range of}} conditions, including <b>neurinoma.</b> The radiologic discrimination between metastases and neurinomas is primarily based on distinct neuroimaging features, particularly number, size and growth pattern. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report the first case of a solitary leptomeningeal metastasis of a cervical nerve-root, which mimicked a benign dumbbell-shaped <b>neurinoma,</b> using neuroimaging and visualized intraoperatively. The tumor was successfully treated with surgery followed by adjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCT).

However, due to recent improvements in survival of patients with LM require reconsideration of established strategies.
