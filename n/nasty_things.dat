25|$|In his journals, Alexander Polovtsov, State Secretary during Alexander III's reign, left an unsympathetic {{portrayal}} of Grand Duchess Olga. Although he admitted she was clever, he described {{her as an}} acid-tongued, quarrelsome, idle woman, who did nothing but sit in her palace {{on the bank of}} the Neva river and gaze through the window onto the walking people and speak <b>nasty</b> <b>things</b> about them. Just a sharp-tongued high-society lady without any other hobbies but gossiping and caring about privileges for her children.|$|E
25|$|For those {{grounded}} in the RPG tradition, the very first release of Call of Cthulhu created a brand new framework for table-top gaming. Rather than the traditional format established by Dungeons & Dragons, which often involved the characters wandering through caves or tunnels and fighting different types of monsters, Sandy Petersen introduced {{the concept of the}} Onion Skin: Interlocking layers of information and nested clues that lead the Player Characters from seemingly minor investigations into a missing person to discovering mind-numbingly awful, global conspiracies to destroy the world. Unlike its predecessor games, CoC assumed that most investigators would not survive, alive or sane, and that the only safe {{way to deal with the}} vast majority of <b>nasty</b> <b>things</b> described in the rule books was to run away. A well-run CoC campaign should engender a sense of foreboding and inevitable doom in its players. The style and setting of the game, in a relatively modern time period, created an emphasis on real-life settings, character research, and thinking one's way around trouble.|$|E

The series has been described by the British Film Institute as having [...] "created a phenomenon unlike any other British TV programme", and by The Times newspaper as [...] "quintessential to being British". Newman had long been a science-fiction fan: [...] "p to the age of 40, I don't think there was a science-fiction book I hadn't read.

He sees himself in his personal drama, I think, increasingly as a religious leader and he has public lunches with some of these very powerful evangelists, Pat Robertson and The 700 Club for instance.

500|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, American Continental's profits {{were in the}} {{millions}} and it had become the biggest single-family home builder in Phoenix and Denver. At its peak it would have $6 billion in assets, {{a large number of}} subsidiaries, 2,500 employees, and a headquarters complex on Phoenix's Camelback Road. It had three corporate jets and a helicopter. He was a very hard worker and a strong presence to his employees; one later said, [...] "It's almost magnetic. When he moves, things happen. The office would come alive when he walked in." [...] He inspired both camaraderie and fervent loyalty in them. While he demanded long hours, he often rewarded employees monetarily and with gifts. Businesspeople outside his company often found Keating arrogant and difficult to deal with. Congressman William Keating, who was well-liked, said of his brother: [...] "Charlie is impatient, aggressive, always on the move. He has clearly defined goals. I don't think he worries about the popularity of his positions." [...] A Fortune profile in 1977 reported, [...] "It seems almost impossible to find anyone who actually likes Charlie Keating." [...] The story rankled Keating, who later had over five thousand large yellow [...] "I Like Charlie Keating" [...] buttons made up which he handed out to employees and visitors. Keating said, [...] "There {{are a lot of people}} that would say <b>nasty</b> <b>things,</b> I'm sure, about me, but it ain't true that nobody ever liked Charlie Keating." ...|$|E

[...] When {{asked for a}} clarification and if he really hated Utah, he continued, [...] "I think the whole university and their fans and the organization is [...] classless. They threw beer on my family and stuff last year and did {{a whole bunch of}} <b>nasty</b> <b>things.</b> I don't respect them and they deserved to lose." [...] During the game, Hall had 12 completions out of 32 pass attempts for 134 yards. He had two touchdown passes and no interceptions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{notion of}} gremlins was first {{conceived}} during World War II when mechanical failures in aircraft were jokingly {{blamed on the}} small monsters. The term [...] "gremlins" [...] also entered popular culture as children's author Roald Dahl published a book called The Gremlins in 1943, based on the mischievous creatures. Walt Disney considered making a film of it. A Bugs Bunny cartoon of the era, Falling Hare, has him battling a gremlin on an airplane. Joe Dante had read The Gremlins {{and said that the}} book was of some influence on his film. In 1983, Dante publicly distanced his work from earlier films, explaining, [...] "Our gremlins are somewhat different—they're sort of green and they have big mouths and they smile a lot and they do incredibly, really <b>nasty</b> <b>things</b> to people and enjoy it all the while".|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{reaction}} was mixed. Some accused {{the music of}} being [...] "sickly and practically lifeless" [...] and of sounding [...] "like the noise of a squeaky door {{or a piece of}} furniture being moved about, or a child crying in the distance." [...] Camille Saint-Saëns, a relentless opponent of Debussy's music, claimed he had abandoned his customary summer holidays so he could stay in Paris and [...] "say <b>nasty</b> <b>things</b> about Pelléas." [...] But others — especially the younger generation of composers, students and aesthetes — were highly enthusiastic. Debussy's friend Paul Dukas lauded the opera, Romain Rolland described it as [...] "one of the three or four outstanding achievements in French musical history", and Vincent d'Indy wrote an extensive review which compared the work to Wagner and early-17th-century Italian opera. D'Indy found Pelléas moving, too: [...] "The composer has in fact simply felt and expressed the human feelings and human sufferings in human terms, despite the outward appearance the characters present of living in a dream." [...] The opera won a [...] "cult following" [...] among young aesthetes, and the writer Jean Lorrain satirised the [...] "Pelléastres" [...] who aped the costumes and hairstyles of Mary Garden {{and the rest of the}} cast.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2004, NBC {{executive}} Marc Graboff informed Ross of the conversations, and he in turn ran {{the idea}} of waiting four more years to O'Brien, who was immediately receptive. Zucker, along with top late-night executive Rick Ludwin, met with Leno in March at his Burbank studio to discuss the contract extension, and explained the network's stance on handing over the show to O'Brien. While Leno quietly felt both disappointed and befuddled, he noted {{he did not want}} to see himself and O'Brien go through the same dilemma he and Letterman faced twelve years earlier, and agreed to the plans. His only request was that NBC wait to announce O'Brien's installment as host well after the extension, to which the executives agreed. While Leno handled the news professionally (to Zucker's relief), he soon headed to Tonight Show producer Debbie Vickers' office to let her know he felt as if he had just been fired. NBC's announcement of the renewal inevitably led to press speculation on O'Brien's fate; to that end, O'Brien and his team went with the charade, peppering interviews with unclear, vague statements on his future. On September 27, 2004, O'Brien officially signed on to become the next host of The Tonight Show; NBC allowed the first comment aside from the press release to come from Leno on that night's show. [...] "'Cause this, you know, this show is like a dynasty,” Leno said. “You hold it, and then you hand it off to the next person. And I don’t want to see all the fighting and all the 'Who’s better?' and <b>nasty</b> <b>things</b> back and forth in the press. So right now, here it is—Conan, it's yours! See you in five years, buddy!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1925, {{the family}} settled in Paris, {{where they would}} live for the next 14 years. At about this time Tsvetaeva {{contracted}} tuberculosis. Tsvetaeva received a small stipend from the Czechoslovak government, which gave financial support to artists and writers {{who had lived in}} Czechoslovakia. In addition, she tried to make whatever she could from readings and sales of her work. She turned more and more to writing prose because she found it made more money than poetry. Tsvetaeva did not feel at all at home in Paris's predominantly ex-bourgeois circle of Russian émigré writers. Although she had written passionately pro-'White' poems during the Revolution, her fellow émigrés thought that she was insufficiently anti-Soviet, and that her criticism of the Soviet régime was altogether too nebulous. She was particularly criticised for writing an admiring letter to the Soviet poet Vladimir Mayakovsky. In the wake of this letter, the émigré paper The Latest News, to which Tsvetaeva had been a frequent contributor, refused point-blank to publish any more of her work. She found solace in her correspondence with other writers, including Boris Pasternak, Rainer Maria Rilke, the Czech poet Anna Teskova, the critics D. S. Mirsky and Aleksandr Bakhrakh, and the Georgian émigré princess Salomea Andronikova, who became her main source of financial support. Her poetry and critical prose of the time, including her autobiographical prose works of 1934–7, is of lasting literary importance. [...] "Consumed by the daily round", resenting the domesticity that left her no time for solitude or writing, her émigré milieu regarded Tsvetaeva as a crude sort who ignored social graces. Describing her misery, she wrote to Teskova [...] "In Paris, with rare personal exceptions, everyone hates me, they write all sorts of <b>nasty</b> <b>things,</b> leave me out in all sorts of nasty ways, and so on". To Pasternak she complained [...] "They don't like poetry and what am I apart from that, not poetry but that from which it is made. [...] an inhospitable hostess. An young woman in an old dress." [...] She began to look back at even the Prague times with nostalgia and resent her exiled state more deeply.|$|E
