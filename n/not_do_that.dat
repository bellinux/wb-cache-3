5|$|Early in {{his final}} year on campus, Middleton was once again pressed by the {{university}} president to retire from the army {{and go to work}} for the college. Again, Middleton could <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> and began looking for a suitable follow-on assignment. Not having been overseas in over sixteen years, he put in a request for duty in the Philippines. He finished his tenure at LSU in the summer of 1936, having overseen the increase in students completing the ROTC program from about 500 to over 1700 cadets.|$|E
5|$|Polls {{consistently}} {{indicated a}} tight {{race for the}} November general election. Negative ads from both sides dominated the campaign, with Obama's proclaiming that Romney shipped jobs overseas while at Bain Capital and kept money in offshore tax havens and Swiss bank accounts. A related issue dealt with Romney's purported responsibility for actions at Bain Capital after taking the Olympics post. Romney faced demands from Democrats to release additional years of his tax returns, an action a number of Republicans also felt would be wise; after being adamant that he would <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> he released summaries of them in late September. During May and June, the Obama campaign spent heavily {{and was able to}} paint a negative image of Romney in voters' minds before the Romney campaign could construct a positive one.|$|E

25|$|Following a brief move to Salt Lake City, Utah, Underwood {{returned}} to Los Angeles, where she found {{work as a}} waitress at the Pig ‘n Whistle restaurant in downtown Los Angeles. One day in April 1920, she was lamenting to Harry Underwood, a co-worker, that her Hollywood relative had resurfaced and demanded that Underwood live with her again and relinquish her paychecks to her, or she would turn the underage girl over to the authorities. Harry {{told her that the}} relative could <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> if he and Underwood were married. The couple married three weeks later on April 28, 1920.|$|E
25|$|In March 1989, Coulter, Huguenard and Prince {{showed that}} {{ethosuximide}} and dimethadione, both effective anti-absence agents, reduced low-threshold Ca2+ currents in T-type calcium channels in freshly removed thalamic neurons. In June {{of that same}} year, they also found the mechanism of this reduction to be voltage-dependent, using acutely dissociated neurons of rats and guinea pigs; it was also noted that valproic acid, which is also used in absence seizures, did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> The next year, they showed that anticonvulsant succinimides did this and that the pro-convulsant ones did not. The first part was supported by Kostyuk et al. in 1992, who reported a substantial reduction in current in dorsal root ganglia at concentrations ranging from 7 µmol/L to 1mmol/L.|$|E

25|$|The {{border patrol}} mission started with DH-4s and Curtiss JN-4 Jennies, with both {{eventually}} replaced with updated Dayton-Wright DH-4Bs. Most {{of the first}} planes were not properly equipped for field service. Not knowing what turn events on the border might take, the Army wanted the planes ready for any eventuality. Colonel James E. Fechet, Air Service Officer at the Southern Department, found it no easy task to obtain bomb racks, machine gun mounts, cameras, and other equipment. There was a delay, for example, in installing synchronized Martin guns because parts supplied with the guns did not fit the planes on the border. The radios on some planes could send only in code and could <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> very well. Compasses were unreliable, maps sketchy and of little use. The country over which the men had to fly was wild and rough and sparsely populated, with few places for safe emergency landings.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, the Dominion {{begins to}} advance, and seizes control of Deep Space Nine. After a brief retreat, Sisko executes a {{successful}} {{return to the}} space station, but the wider conflict continues. More setbacks hinder the Alpha Quadrant alliance as additional races, such as the Breen, offer their support to the Dominion. Questionable tactics are adopted {{in the search for}} victory, including the dissemination of an engineered virus among the Founders by a shadow Federation group called Section 31. A ruse involving a murder is used to enlist the help of the Romulans against the Dominion, and dissatisfactions lead the Cardassian leader, Legate Damar, to launch a successful resistance movement against his former Dominion comrades. Eventually, the Dominion is forced back to the planet Cardassia Prime where it is cut off from reinforcements. The female shapeshifter in command informs Odo that they would fight to the end to prevent any counter-attack by the alliance into the Gamma Quadrant. Odo assures her that the Federation would <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> while the other parties would be too weak to. After linking together, Odo cures the female shapeshifter of the biological disease afflicting her and the other Founders with the antidote he received and the Dominion agrees to surrender.|$|E
500|$|According to Ohlin (op. cit., p.222), one cannot say [...] "that {{the rate}} of {{interest}} equalises planned savings and planned investment, for it obviously does <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> How, then, is {{the height of the}} interest rate determined. The answer is that {{the rate of}} interest is simply the price of credit, and that it is therefore governed by the supply of and demand for credit. The banking system – through its ability to give credit – can influence, and to some extent does affect, the interest level." ...|$|E

500|$|Zack Handlen, {{while writing}} for The A.V. Club in 2009, said that Whitney was a [...] "competent actress", but that Rand [...] "represents some of Treks most egregious offenses against feminism". He criticized her role within the show, and {{specifically}} in [...] "Charlie X" [...] when Charlie slaps her bottom {{and none of}} the characters can explain why he should <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> Michelle Erica Green praised the [...] "substantial" [...] role given to Rand in [...] "Flashback" [...] while writing for TrekNation, adding that {{this was the first time}} such a role had been given to the character in the franchise. However, she criticized Rand's being written out part way through the episode as she felt that the character could have had more to contribute to the plot.|$|E
500|$|Finkelstein noted 20 instances, {{in as many}} pages, where Dershowitz's book {{cites the}} same sources and {{passages}} used by Joan Peters in her book, in largely the same sequence, with ellipses in the same places. In two instances, Dershowitz reproduces Peters's errors (see below). From this Finkelstein concluded that Dershowitz had not checked the original sources himself, contrary to the latter's claims. Finkelstein suggests that this copying of quotations amounts to copying ideas. Examining {{a copy of a}} proof of Dershowitz's book he managed to obtain, he found evidence that Dershowitz had his secretarial assistant, Holly Beth Billington, check in the Harvard library the sources he had read in Peters's book. Dershowitz answered the charge {{in a letter to the}} University of California's Press Director Lynne Withey, arguing that Finkelstein had made up the smoking gun quotation, in that he had changed its wording (from 'cite' to 'copy') in his book. In public debate he has stated that if [...] "somebody borrowed the quote without going to check back on whether Mark Twain had said that, obviously that would be a serious charge"; however, he insisted emphatically that he himself did <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> that he had indeed checked the original source by Twain.|$|E
500|$|With the {{intention}} of playing the 2015 season in the forward line alongside Jesse Hogan and Chris Dawes, a groin injury hampered Watts' pre-season training for three months heading into the season. He had a strong start to the season recording seventeen disposals, seven marks and three goals in the club's twenty-six point win against Gold Coast at the MCG in round one and was named in Melbourne's best players by AFL Media. After a buoyant start to the season, he quickly found himself facing negativity from the media after the round three loss to Adelaide at the Adelaide Oval where he dropped two marks in quick succession, with one leading to an Adelaide goal. Multiple media figures called {{for him to be}} dropped with David Schwarz stating he [...] "might have to sit out a week" [...] and Dermott Brereton professing [...] "you have to make a stand as to what your team stands for, and that means you can't bring him back in until you are convinced he will <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> again"; Jason Dunstall supplemented these statements by noting [...] "he can't relapse into these kind of performances", adding [...] "I don't like using the word, but he looked a little soft at times".|$|E
