50|$|All {{students}} {{of the history of}} the eighteenth century are grateful to Ayscough for his share in indexing the 'Gentleman's Magazine' (1731-86), consisting of the two volumes printed in 1789, the first of which includes an index of the essays, dissertations, and historical passages in one alphabet, and the second being divided into four parts, is devoted respectively to poetry, names of persons, plates, and books noticed. Useful as it is, the index is not by any means perfect. The lists of persons in each volume of the periodical had unfortunately never been furnished with Christian names, and where more than one reference occurred no sort of distinction was introduced. This method was continued by Ayscough in his general index, so that in the case of common names, such as Smith or Williams, there are hundreds of references, making the task of hunting up any particular fact almost hopeless. In the continuation on the same plan, published in 1821, the evil is made worse by the increase of the materials, so that there are no less than 2,411 entries under Smith without further particulars. It has been calculated that, owing to the time taken up in referring back to each volume, it would occupy eighty hours of hard work to look through all the Smiths in search of one particular individual of that name (see Wheatley's What is an Index? p. 46). Until Ayscough brought out his 'Index' in 1790 there was <b>no</b> <b>concordance</b> to Shakespeare. This was a speculation on the part of the publisher, John Stockdale, who paid two hundred guineas for the index, which was specially designed to accompany his edition of the 'Dramatic Works,' in 2 vols. roy. 8vo. In this excellent compilation the words are arranged alphabetically with the lines in which they occur, then the name of the play, and in five separate columns the act, scene, page, column, and line. The last three particulars of course refer only to the edition of 1790, but the index may be made to serve any other text. Francis Twiss compiled a 'Verbal Index' in 1805, not so useful as that of Ayscough, and both were superseded by Mrs. Cowden Clarke's valuable 'Concordance' (1845). All three are devoted to the plays alone, and require to be supplemented by Mrs. Furness's 'Concordance to Shakespeare's Poems' (1874). There is still no complete concordance to the entire works.|$|E

The effects of an active versus an inactive state or condition were examined for all three behaviors. No overall lateral biases were found for head turning or for the first foot to move in stepping and placing, and there were <b>no</b> <b>concordances</b> among them; however, there was an asymmetry in that the left foot had a shorter onset latency when compared to the right foot for both stepping and placing.

40|$|Objectives: The aim was {{to verify}} the {{concordance}} of CT evaluation among four radiologists (two oral and maxillofacial and two medical radiologists) at the TN (tumour/node) stage and in the follow-up of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer patients. The study also compared differences between clinical and CT examinations in determining the TN stage. Methods: The following clinical and tomographic findings of 15 non-treated oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer patients were compared: tumour size, bone invasion and lymph node metastases. In another 15 patients, who had previously been treated, a clinical and tomographic analysis comparison {{for the presence of}} tumoural recurrence, post-therapeutic changes in muscles and lymph node metastases was performed. The concordances of tomographic evaluation between the radiologists were analysed using the kappa index. Results: Significant agreement was verified between all radiologists for the T stage, but not for the N stage. In the group of treated patients, CT disclosed post-therapeutic changes in muscles, tumour recurrence and lymph node metastases, but <b>no</b> <b>concordance</b> for the detection of lymph node metastases was found between radiologists. In the first group, for all radiologists, <b>no</b> <b>concordance</b> was demonstrated between clinical and tomographic staging. CT was effective for delimitating advanced lesions and for detecting lymph node involvement in N 0 stage patients. CT revealed two cases of bone invasion not clinically detected. Conclusions: Interprofessional relationships must be stimulated to improve diagnoses, and to promote a multidisciplinary approach to oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer. Although CT was important in the diagnosis and follow-up of cancer patients, differences between medical and dental analyses should be acknowledged.

40|$|Abstract Background and {{objectives}} Although there is controversy regarding {{the role of}} venous oxygen saturation in the initial resuscitation of septic patients with hypoperfusion these markers are still widely used. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation and concordance between central (SvcO 2) and mixed (SvO 2) oxygen saturation in septic shock patients with or without hypoperfusion {{in addition to the}} impact of these differences in patient conduction. Methods Patients with septic shock were monitored with pulmonary artery catheter and the following subgroups of hypoperfusion were analyzed: 1) lactate > 28 mg. dL- 1; 2) base excess ≤ - 5 mmol. L- 1; 3) venoarterial CO 2 gradient > 6 mmHg; 4) SvO 2 28 mg. dL- 1 and SvO 2 28 mg. dL- 1 and SvcO 2 < 75 %. Results Seventy-seven samples from 24 patients were included. There was only a moderate correlation between SvO 2 and SvcO 2 (r = 0. 72, p = 0. 0001) and there was <b>no</b> good <b>concordance</b> between these variables (7. 35 % bias and 95 % concordance limits of - 3. 0 % to 17. 7 %).

With its ultrashort half-life and a potent and consistent vasodilator effect, adenosine may be the coronary vasodilator of choice with myocardial perfusion imaging. Fifty-one healthy subjects and 93 patients with suspected coronary artery disease constituted the study group. In this multicenter study the comparative safety and diagnostic efficacy of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) thallium imaging during adenosine-induced coronary hyperemia was compared with exercise treadmill stress. There was a mean increase in heart rate of 37 % and a mean decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 5 % during the adenosine infusion of 140 μg/kg per min for 6 min. Adenosine infusion was well tolerated in 95 % of the subjects. Side effects requiring intervention occurred in seven subjects (5 %). None of the subjects experienced a life-threatening complication. The sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy for detection of coronary artery disease with use of quantitative analysis was 83 %, 87 % and 84 % for adenosine SPECT and 82 %, 80 % and 81 % for exercise SPECT studies, respectively. Most false negative results with adenosine, as well as exercise SPECT studies, {{occurred in patients with}} single-vessel disease. The first-order <b>concordance</b> (<b>no</b> defect vs. defect) and second-order <b>concordance</b> (<b>no</b> defect vs. irreversible vs. reversible defect) was 89 % and 78 % between the two studies, respectively. Thus, the results of adenosine SPECT imaging are highly concordant with exercise SPECT thallium imaging.
