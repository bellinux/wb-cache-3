Macrozoobenthos is used {{as one of the}} {{biological}} component in monitoring of water quality. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the macrozoobenthos community structure in Pandansari waters, District of Sayung, Demak. There were 4 stations earned 48 genera consist of 7 class, including in the 6 phyla of Molluscs (35 species), Polychaeta (17 species), Crustaceans (5 species), Sipuncula (1 species), nematodes (1 species) and <b>Nemertina</b> (1 species). Macrozoobenthos abundance ranged from 1. 910 - 21. 442 ind/m 3, with a diversity index of 0. 45 - 2. 67, which indicated that the carrying capacity of Pandansari waters to support macrozoobenthos live is low to moderate. The evenness index ranged from 0. 23 - 0. 97 are in the category of small to high which indicated the proportion is not the same type of macrozoobenthos, and dominance index of 0. 08 - 0. 82, which indicated there was species dominating macrozoobenthos in the waters of Pandansari, district of Sayung, Demak...|$|E
40|$|The diet of the smooth-hound Mustelus mustelus in {{the eastern}} Adriatic Sea was {{investigated}} with respect to fish size and season. Stomach contents of 139 specimens, 67 to 137 cm in TL, collected by bottom-trawl from 2001 to 2003 were analyzed. Of {{the total number of}} stomachs examined, 24 were empty (17. 2 %). The prey items identified in stomachs belong to eight major groups: Cephalopoda, Polychaeta, <b>Nemertina,</b> Stomatopoda, Decapoda, Enteropneusta, Tunicata and Teleostei. Decapod crustaceans were the most abundant prey (%IRI= 63. 1 %) especially for individuals up to 110 cm TL. Teleosts were second in importance (%IRI= 31. 2) whereas othe rprey groups were of minor importance and were probably incidentally ingetsed food. At the species level, the decapods Atelecyclus rotundatus (%IRI= 6. 7) and Munida rugosa (%IRI= 4. 3) followed by the teleost Sardina pilchardus (%IRI= 2. 7) were the most frequent prey. With m. mustelu sgrowth, the proportion of deacpods decreased whereas that of teleosts and cephalopods increased. Diet composition showed little seasonal variation; decapods were teh most important prey taxon in all seasons, especially in summer. The results indicate that the smooth-hound feeds {{on a wide range of}} prey items and can be considered an opportunistic predator...|$|E
