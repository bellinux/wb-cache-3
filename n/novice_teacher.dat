As he himself noted in 1936: [...] "Although not a literary professional, I always had {{a soft spot for}} literature." [...] He also had an enduring passion for history, as noted by his professor Nicolae Iorga, who recommended him for a teacher's chair. During a stint as a <b>novice</b> <b>teacher</b> in Brăila, he had his [...] "second encounter" [...] with Haret, who, as Education Minister, was personally inspecting the local schools. He equated listening to Haret's speech as a personal revelation about the sheer force of one's creative energies. Returning to Bucharest, Banu began working as a history professor at Matei Basarab High School in 1898, part of a teaching staff which came to include Dimitrie D. Pătrășcanu, Emanoil Grigorovitza, Theodor Speranția, Alexandru Toma, and Eugen Lovinescu. He later transferred to the Nifon Mitropolitul Seminary. In this environment, Banu founded a literary-and-theatrical society, with contributions from pupil Petre Locusteanu, who later became his friend and close associate. At the time, Banu also took up work as a promoter of public literacy, joining Ioan Kalinderu and Barbu Știrbey's Steaua Association, which had as its object [...] "the strengthening of education among regular folk through moral, patriotic and useful publications".|$|E

Some {{studies have found that}} 40 - 50 % of novice teachers will leave the profession before they reach their fifth year of teaching. Previous literature states that novice teachers leave because of job dissatisfaction, school conditions and feeling ineffective with their students. This study uses a mixed methods design to explore <b>novice</b> <b>teacher</b> commitment by examining four <b>novice</b> <b>teacher</b> domains: teacher beliefs, pre and early teaching experiences, feelings of effectiveness and community context. Three research questions were created to guide this exploration : (1) what are <b>novice</b> <b>teacher</b> beliefs about teaching and how do they relate to feelings of effectiveness and school context? (2) What are novice teachers' pre and early teaching experiences and what is their relationship to teacher beliefs and feelings of effectiveness? And (3) how do novice teachers talk about their commitment to the profession and is their commitment related to their beliefs or experiences? Ecocultural theory and the efficacy construct were utilized to better understand how novice teachers develop feelings of effectiveness and how the teaching context affects the aforementioned <b>novice</b> <b>teacher</b> domains. The mixed methods approach included three key data sources: a teacher survey, semi-structured interviews, and school documents. All three sources were analyzed looking for common patterns among data points. Qualitative and quantitative findings indicate that teaching context is of principal importance and serves as a mediator between the <b>novice</b> <b>teacher</b> and her beliefs, feelings of effectiveness, and commitment to the teaching profession. Additionally, qualitative analysis indicated that novice teachers are more likely to remain in the profession past their first five years if given probationary or permanent status and the appropriate school structural supports. Among the most critical structural supports are protected collaboration time, administrative support, and support staff support. Recommendations include providing novice teachers with weekly protected collaboration time, creating positive interactions between novice teachers and their administration, and supplying novice teachers with school support staff. These recommendations all support the <b>novice</b> <b>teacher</b> in their feelings of effectiveness in the classroom and subsequent commitment to the teaching professio...|$|E
40|$|The {{first years}} of {{teaching}} career have been indisputably problematic for most of novice teachers. Not only possessing the new environment of the work place to adapt to, but also handling and maintaining adequate classroom performances are of the major issues, which in turn, some helps are assumed crucial for them. Considering the importance to overcome the matters, this study was aimed at investigating reflective teaching (RT) undertaken by a <b>novice</b> <b>teacher</b> {{in an attempt to}} improve his classroom performances. This is classroom action research (CAR), where the practice of RT was undertaken through collaborative mentoring. The <b>novice</b> <b>teacher,</b> in this case, had a joint-work with an experienced teacher. The <b>novice</b> <b>teacher</b> acted as a teacher mentee and the experienced one as the teacher mentor. In addition, this study was also aimed at acquiring opinions from both teacher mentee and teacher mentor about the implemented RT. The data were collected through questionnaires, observations, interviews & triadic and/or dyadic conferences, and document collections. They were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. As the results, through the process of RT, the teacher mentee’s improved performances were identified. However, the improvement was seen only from the aspects of teacher pedagogical knowledge, and not yet explored from the aspects of the teacher content knowledge. This indicated that another further study of RT viewed from the related observed aspects of teacher content knowledge seems necessarily demanding.

The results suggests that a <b>novice</b> <b>teacher</b> recognized the class as merely mosaic of time that consist of the past, the present and the future, but a mastery teacher looked at the present awaring both space and time generally and partially. It was also found that the rate of adaptation of the learners to a class was higher in the learners grouped by a mastery teacher...|$|E
40|$|In {{an urban}} school {{district}} in North Texas, {{there was a problem}} retaining highly qualified novice teachers. This phenomenological study examined the experiences of novice teachers to understand why some teachers demonstrated the resiliency to succeed as professional educators and to suggest potential solutions to improve <b>novice</b> <b>teacher</b> retention. Guided by Henderson and Milstein 2 ̆ 7 s theory of resilience, 8 novice teachers with 2 - 5 years of teaching experience participated in semi structured interviews. Research questions elicited the experiences that empowered <b>novice</b> <b>teacher</b> resiliency, the perceived role of administrators and colleagues to cultivate and build capacity, and recommendations to promote resiliency. Data analyses included an inductive thematic coding process to separate the data and identify themes. According to study findings, novice teachers 2 ̆ 7 support from instructional specialists and colleagues contributed to their resiliency and retention. Participants indicated that a university education alone did not prepare them for the realities of teaching in at-risk learning communities. The participants suggested differentiated professional development to address the challenges of teaching in at-risk schools. A Comprehensive Professional Development Plan was created to address the gap in <b>novice</b> <b>teacher</b> resiliency and retention and to improve instructional practices {{to meet the needs of}} novice teachers and to provide a stable and responsive learning community for students to achieve social, emotional, and academic success. This study has the potential to produce positive social change by building capacity, resiliency, and retention through a long-term comprehensive professional development plan for inducting novice teachers...|$|E
40|$|Many of America's {{schools are}} {{populated}} with diverse student populations, while the teaching population remains largely White. This creates dissonance for White {{teachers and students}} of color. Possibly mentoring can assist novice White teachers as they enculturate into the profession and their culturally diverse campuses. This qualitative research, conducted from an Interpretivism paradigm, used {{a case study of}} a White female <b>novice</b> <b>teacher</b> at a culturally diverse campus to understand the role mentoring played in a White female novice teacher's perceptions of her enculturation into a culturally diverse campus. Several methods of data collection were used, including 9 semi-structured interviews with the <b>novice</b> <b>teacher,</b> email dialogues, 3 days of shadowing, as well as two semi-structured interviews with the subject's principal and mentor. The data was analyzed using the constant comparative method. This White female <b>novice</b> <b>teacher</b> taught at a campus with a large Hispanic student population. She struggled to feel confident in her work and in her relationships with her mentor, her fellow teachers, her administrators, her students and their parents. She relied heavily on her faith and her fellow <b>novice</b> <b>teacher</b> and teammate. Her mentor visited her once a week. She liked her mentor, but never felt she received the assistance desired. She recognized she knew little about the Hispanic culture of her students; she was willing to learn more, but failed to see her own privileged membership in the dominant White culture and its effect on interactions with her students. The discussion of this study looks at the structuring of an effective mentoring program for novice teachers, and the new teacher?s frustrations with the mentoring received; her relationship struggles with her principal and other staff, but also some successes in forming friendly relationships; her desire to understand her Hispanic students and their culture, yet her inability to see her membership in the dominant culture, as well has her school and district's "color-blind" approach to race; and her perceptions of her enculturation into the profession of teaching. The conclusions of this study discuss mentoring new teachers, the role of principals in the induction of new teachers, cultural differences between teachers and students, and the influence of faith and character with a teacher and his/her teaching...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the experiences of <b>novice</b> <b>teachers</b> of induction in three selected schools in Oshana region, Namibia. The point of departure is that the experiences of <b>novice</b> <b>teachers</b> of induction and support are not known. The problem was investigated by means of a literature study and empirical investigation, using a qualitative, phenomenological approach. Findings revealed that <b>novice</b> <b>teachers</b> do not have the same needs and do not have similar experiences of support. Key findings reveal that novice teachers’ problems can be solved better if support is given timeously and over a longer period, with all the stakeholders’ equal involvement in the induction process. <b>Novice</b> <b>teachers</b> are capable of making meaningful contributions to schools, and schools can benefit from them. The study recommends that novice teachers’ voices be heard and their views be incorporated when planning future induction programmes, to suit their individual and contextual needs.

40|$|Purpose – This {{study was}} aimed at {{determining}} the level of <b>teacher</b> efficacy among <b>novice</b> <b>teachers</b> in 21 secondary schools in Sabah, Malaysia. It also intended to investigate {{if there is any}} difference in teacher efficacy with respect to gender, types of teacher training and teaching subject. Method – Using the causal comparison design study, data were collected using the Teacher Sense of Effi cacy Scale from 176 <b>novice</b> <b>teachers.</b> Findings – The mean obtained for teacher efficacy was moderately high, with <b>novice</b> <b>teachers</b> being more efficacious in class management. The findings showed that there were significant differences in teacher efficacy according to gender, types of teacher training, and teaching subject. The types of teacher training was found to be the main contributor to the variance in teacher efficacy as compared to gender and teaching subject. Value – The study might implicate the conventional practice in school systems pertaining to professionalism opportunities upon <b>novice</b> <b>teachers...</b>|$|R
