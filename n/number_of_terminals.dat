In June 2013, Gulftainer completed a major acquisition by securing the majority shareholding in Saudi Arabia's Gulf Stevedoring Contracting Company (GSCCO) almost doubling the company size.

25|$|Massive MIMO is a {{technology}} where the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminals</b> {{is much less}} than the number of base station (mobile station) antennas. In a rich scattering environment, the full advantages of the massive MIMO system can be exploited using simple beamforming strategies such as maximum ratio transmission (MRT), maximum ratio-combining (MRC) or zero forcing (ZF). To achieve these benefits of massive MIMO, accurate CSI must be available perfectly. However, in practice, the channel between the transmitter and receiver is estimated from orthogonal pilot sequences which are limited by the coherence time of the channel. Most importantly, in a multicell setup, the reuse of pilot sequences of several co-channel cells will create pilot contamination. When there is pilot contamination, the performance of massive MIMO degrades quite drastically. To alleviate the effect of pilot contamination, the work of proposes a simple pilot assignment and channel estimation method from limited training sequences.|$|E

Thus, the setting is not directly {{comparable to that of}} the classical disjoint paths problem (when all demands are equal to 1) [...] - we must deal with connections having varied, real-valued amounts of demand, but we impose the boundedness restriction that each connection can consume at most half the capacity of any vertex. Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for the bounded unsplittable flow problem, in an arbitrary graph, when the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> pairs is a fixed constant. Our algorithm is conceptually much simpler than Robertson and Seymour's corresponding algorithm for the disjoint paths problem with a constant <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> pairs; and we can decide the routability of a non-trivially super-constant <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> [...] ...|$|R

30|$|In the IEEE 802.11 medium {{access control}} (MAC) layer protocol, the basic access method is the {{distributed}} coordination function (DCF) {{which is based on}} the mechanism of carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA).

As the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> competing <b>terminals</b> increases, the throughput is degraded. Therefore, when the WLAN networks present over maximum throughput and minimum delay jitter, we expect the handoff to WLAN be avoided and entrance into the CDMA cell be granted.|$|R

In addition to algorithm to compute the relationships, the paper also presents results of experiments with datasets from UCI ML Repository 1.
