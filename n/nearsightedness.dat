However, Blythe, due to his <b>nearsightedness,</b> could have mistaken Nosek for the other fan who had {{repeatedly}} gotten over the guardrail. According to the court, the largest part of the blame lies with the promoters and security members. Judge Kubovec further reproached Blythe for not having met with the Nosek family.|$|E
5|$|The {{porpoise}} eye {{is relatively}} small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, {{the eyes of a}} porpoise are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When porpoises surface, their lens and cornea correct the <b>nearsightedness</b> that results from the refraction of light; their eyes contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Porpoises do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most porpoises have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, they are able to form a very clear image of the surrounding area.|$|E
25|$|Keratoconus (KC) is a {{disorder}} {{of the eye}} which results in progressive thinning of the cornea. This may result in blurry vision, double vision, <b>nearsightedness,</b> astigmatism, and light sensitivity. Usually both eyes are affected. In more severe cases a scarring or a circle may be seen within the cornea.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{sclerosis}} is {{the most}} common type of cataract, and involves the central or 'nuclear' part of the lens. This eventually becomes hard, or 'sclerotic', due to condensation on the lens nucleus and the deposition of brown pigment within the lens. In its advanced stages it is called a brunescent cataract. This type of cataract can present with a shift to <b>nearsightedness,</b> causing problems with distance vision though reading is less affected.|$|E
25|$|Muncie {{was one of}} {{the first}} players to wear glasses or goggles while playing. He began wearing glasses at Arizona Western, when he wore them at {{practice}} one day and realized they improved his <b>nearsightedness.</b> Muncie wore thick black frames throughout his career, switching to sports goggles late in his career. While with the Saints, he was featured in a full-page ad by glassmaker PPG for shatter-resistant glasses. Decades later in the 2010s, National Basketball Association (NBA) players were considered hipsters for wearing thick black glasses.|$|E
25|$|A {{common cause}} of low visual acuity is {{refractive}} error (ametropia), or errors in how the light is refracted in the eyeball. Causes of refractive errors include aberrations {{in the shape of}} the eyeball, the shape of the cornea, and reduced flexibility of the lens. Too high or too low refractive error (in relation to the length of the eyeball) is the cause of <b>nearsightedness</b> (myopia) or farsightedness (hyperopia) (normal refractive status is referred to as emmetropia). Other optical causes are astigmatism or more complex corneal irregularities. These anomalies can mostly be corrected by optical means (such as eyeglasses, contact lenses, laser surgery, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Glasses, {{also known}} as {{eyeglasses}} or spectacles, are devices consisting of glass or hard plastic lenses mounted in a frame that holds {{them in front of}} a person's eyes, typically using a bridge over the nose and arms which rest over the ears. Glasses are typically used for vision correction, such as with reading glasses and glasses used for <b>nearsightedness.</b> Safety glasses provide eye protection against flying debris for construction workers or lab technicians; these glasses may have protection for the sides of the eyes {{as well as in the}} lenses. Some types of safety glasses are used to protect against visible and near-visible light or radiation. Glasses are worn for eye protection in some sports, such as squash. Glasses wearers may use a strap to prevent the glasses from falling off during movement or sports. Wearers of glasses that are used only part of the time may have the glasses attached to a cord that goes around their neck, to prevent the loss of the glasses.|$|E
25|$|In the Magic Land {{stories of}} Alexander Melentyevich Volkov, the {{prehistory}} is quite different. The land was created 6,000–7,000years {{ago by a}} wizard named Hurricap, who was tired of people coming to him with requests, {{so he decided to}} find a place without them annoying him. He found a remote land and separated it {{from the rest of the}} world, along with putting the enchantments of eternal spring and talking animals (Volkov's version doesn't include any forms of immortality). However, he failed to notice that the land already contained people (since he was a giant, already suffering from <b>nearsightedness</b> in his advanced age, and the people in the Magic Land were much shorter than in other places), but, upon discovering the fact, decided that removing the enchantments would be unnecessary. Instead, he ordered the people to keep away from his castle. After that, the notable events included a conquest attempt by a sorceress named Arachna (Gurrikap was still alive, and put her in an enchanted sleep for 5,000years. Her awakening formed the story for the fifth book in Volkov's series), an unsuccessful coup by a prince named Bofaro to overthrow his father about 1,000years ago (He and his accomplices were banished to an underground cave and became the Magic Land's main source of metal and gems, an analogue to the Nomes), and the arrival of the Four Witches (which only occurred about 500years ago in this continuity).|$|E
500|$|In 2004 the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) {{published}} {{a review of}} various research regarding [...] "visual training", which consisted of [...] "eye exercises, muscle relaxation techniques, biofeedback, eye patches, or eye massages", [...] "alone or in combinations". No evidence was found that such techniques could objectively benefit eyesight, though some studies noted changes, both positive and negative, in the visual acuity of nearsighted subjects as measured by a Snellen chart. In some cases noted improvements were maintained at subsequent follow-ups. However, these results were not seen as actual reversals of <b>nearsightedness,</b> and were attributed instead to factors such as [...] "improvements in interpreting blurred images, changes in mood or motivation, creation of an artificial contact lens by tear film changes, or a pinhole effect from miosis of the pupil." ...|$|E

500|$|Medical {{professionals}} characterize refractive errors such as <b>nearsightedness,</b> farsightedness, astigmatism, and presbyopia (the age-related {{blurring of}} near-point vision) as {{consequences of the}} eye's shape and other basic anatomy, {{which there is no}} evidence that any exercise can alter. Bates, however, believed that these conditions are caused by tension of the muscles surrounding the eyeball, which he believed prevents the eyeball from sufficiently changing shape (per his explanation of accommodation) when gaze is shifted nearer or farther. Bates characterized this supposed muscular tension as the consequence of a [...] "mental strain" [...] to see, the relief of which he claimed would instantly improve sight. He also linked disturbances in the circulation of blood, which he said is [...] "very largely influenced by thought", not only to refractive errors but also to double vision, crossed-eye, lazy eye, and to more serious eye conditions such as cataracts and glaucoma. His therapies were based on these assumptions.|$|E

2500|$|They {{asserted}} that formal schooling before ages 8–12 not only lacked the anticipated effectiveness, but also harmed children. The Moores published their view that formal schooling was damaging young children academically, socially, mentally, and even physiologically. The Moores presented evidence that childhood {{problems such as}} juvenile delinquency, <b>nearsightedness,</b> increased enrollment of students in special education classes and behavioral problems {{were the result of}} increasingly earlier enrollment of students. The Moores cited studies demonstrating that orphans who were given surrogate mothers were measurably more intelligent, with superior long-term effects – even though the mothers were [...] "mentally retarded teenagers" [...] – and that illiterate tribal mothers in Africa produced children who were socially and emotionally more advanced than typical western children, [...] "by western standards of measurement".|$|E
2500|$|Whistler {{was sent}} to Christ Church Hall School with his mother's hopes that he would become a minister. Whistler was seldom without his sketchbook and was popular with his classmates for his caricatures. However, {{it became clear that}} a career in {{religion}} did not suit him, so he applied to the United States Military Academy at West Point, where his father had taught drawing and other relatives had attended. He was admitted to the highly selective institution in July 1851 on the strength of his family name, despite his extreme <b>nearsightedness</b> and poor health history. However, during his three years there, his grades were barely satisfactory, and he was a sorry sight at drill and dress, known as [...] "Curly" [...] for his hair length which exceeded regulations. Whistler bucked authority, spouted sarcastic comments, and racked up demerits. Colonel Robert E Lee was the West Point Superintendent and, after considerable indulgence toward Whistler, {{he had no choice but}} to dismiss the young cadet. Whistler's major accomplishment at West Point was learning drawing and map making from American artist Robert W. Weir.|$|E
2500|$|Corrective lenses {{are used}} to correct {{refractive}} errors by bending the light entering the eye in order to alleviate the effects of conditions such as <b>nearsightedness</b> (myopia), farsightedness (Hypermetropia) or astigmatism. The ability of one's eyes to accommodate their focus to near and distant focus alters over time. Also, few people have eyes that show exactly equal refractive characteristics; one may need a [...] "stronger", (i.e. more [...] refracting), lens than the other. A common condition in people over forty years old is presbyopia, which {{is caused by the}} eye's crystalline lens losing elasticity, progressively reducing the ability of the lens to accommodate (i.e. to focus on objects close to the eye). Corrective lenses, to bring the image back into focus on the retina, are made to conform to the prescription of an ophthalmologist or optometrist. [...] A lensmeter can be used to verify the specifications of an existing pair of glasses. Corrective eyeglasses can significantly improve the life quality of the wearer. [...] Not only do they enhance the wearer's visual experience, but can also reduce problems that result from eye strain, such as headaches or squinting.|$|E
