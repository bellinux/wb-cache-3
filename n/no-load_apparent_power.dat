In a nonsinusoidal and unbalanced three-phase power system, the calculation of <b>apparent</b> <b>powers</b> and power factors has many definitions. Load characteristics of harmonic and unbalance can not be expressed in the traditional <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> and power factor, which only consider the fundamental and three-phase balanced sinusoidal conditions. This paper utilizes the FPGA chip to develop the platform to implement the calculation methods of <b>apparent</b> <b>powers</b> and power factors. The proposed design scheme is developed using the very high speed integrated-circuit hardware description language (VHDL), which provides high flexibility and technology independence. This paper discussed the effective power and power factor, the arithmetic power and power factor, and the fundamental power and power factor. The design of filters for the computation of fundamental frequency components is given. ModelSim is used at first to simulate the calculation of <b>apparent</b> <b>powers</b> and power factors to ensure the accuracy of timing and function. Research {{results show that the}} designed chip can compute accurately the <b>apparent</b> <b>powers</b> and power factors considering the effects of nonsinusoidal and unbalanced conditions...|$|R
25|$|The {{power factor}} {{is defined as}} the ratio of real <b>power</b> to <b>apparent</b> <b>power.</b> As power is {{transferred}} along a transmission line, it does not consist purely of real power that can do work once transferred to the load, but rather consists of a combination of real and reactive <b>power,</b> called <b>apparent</b> <b>power.</b> The power factor describes the amount of real power transmitted along a transmission line relative to the total <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> flowing in the line.|$|R
25|$|For example, to get 1kW of real power, if {{the power}} factor is unity, 1kVA of <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> {{needs to be}} {{transferred}} (1kW ÷ 1 = 1kVA). At low values of <b>power</b> factor, more <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> needs {{to be transferred to}} get the same real power. To get 1kW of real power at 0.2 power factor, 5kVA of <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> needs to be transferred (1kW ÷ 0.2 = 5kVA). This <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> must be produced and transmitted to the load, and is subject to the losses in the production and transmission processes.|$|R

5000|$|The {{relationship}} between real power, reactive <b>power</b> and <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> {{can be expressed}} by representing the quantities as vectors. Real power is represented as a horizontal vector and reactive power is represented as a vertical vector. The <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> vector is the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by connecting the real and reactive power vectors. This representation is often called the power triangle.

25|$|Electrical loads {{consuming}} {{alternating current}} power consume both real power and reactive power. The vector sum of real and reactive <b>power</b> is the <b>apparent</b> <b>power.</b> The presence of reactive power causes {{the real power}} {{to be less than}} the <b>apparent</b> <b>power,</b> and so, the electric load has a power factor of less than 1.|$|R
50|$|The <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> {{delivered}} by a generator as calculated by a simplistic multiplication of the voltage {{and the current}} is, in general, greater than the actual (real) power delivered {{as measured by the}} work done or heat produced. What is more the total <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> consumed by two different circuits is not, in general, equal to their arithmetic sum. Boucherot developed a theorem relating real and <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> with the introduction of a new concept, reactive power. Reactive power represents the energy stored in electric and magnetic fields and is not consumed, hence does not figure in the total of real power. Boucherot's theorem states that the total reactive power can be found by an arithmetic sum of its components and the total real power can likewise be found by an arithmetic sum of its components. The square of the total <b>apparent</b> <b>power,</b> on the other hand, is equal to the sum of the square of the total real power and the square of the total reactive power.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{suggests}} a new definition of <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> {{based on the}} instantaneous power theory. The component corresponding to non-useful power and the quadratic relationship between apparent, active, reactive and non-useful powers are also highlighted. A few case-studies draw a parallel between the results according to the well-known definitions gathered from previous literature and the results based on the new expression. It is shown that, under sinusoidal and balanced conditions, all definitions of <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> lead to the same results. However, {{in the case of}} sinusoidal unbalanced situations, the results based on the new definition are identical only with those corresponding to Buchholz’s and Czarnecki’s definitions.

50|$|For {{the power}} {{supply of the}} whole Mariazell Railway and the region along the line, three 25 Hz {{multi-phase}} generators at the Wienerbruck power station were used with an <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> of 6600 kVA. This accounts for the single-phase railway supply's <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> of 4500 kVA. The equipment is driven by water from the Lassing and the Erlauf. The railway current generated at the Wienerbruck power station at 6.5 kV was partly fed directly into the power lines near the power station, and also partly stepped up to 27 kV to be transmitted to the substations at Kirchberg and Ober-Grafendorf. As a backup against power outages, a power station consisting of two diesel generators, each producing 420 kVA single-phase <b>apparent</b> <b>power,</b> was built at the Alpenbahnhof in St. Pölten.|$|R

25|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, {{the power}} factor of an AC {{electrical power system}} {{is defined as the}} ratio of the real power flowing to the load to the <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> in the circuit, and is a dimensionless number in the closed interval of −1 to 1. A power factor of less than one means that the voltage and current waveforms are not in phase, reducing the instantaneous product of the two waveforms (V × I). Real power is the capacity of the circuit for performing work in a particular time. <b>Apparent</b> <b>power</b> is the product of the current and voltage of the circuit. Due to energy stored in the load and returned to the source, or due to a non-linear load that distorts the wave shape of the current drawn from the source, the <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> will be greater than the real power. A negative power factor occurs when the device (which is normally the load) generates power, which then flows back towards the source, which is normally considered the generator.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the power}} factor (i.e. cos θ) {{increases}}, {{the ratio of}} real <b>power</b> to <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> (which = cos θ), increases and approaches unity (1), while the angle θ decreases and the reactive power decreases[...]|$|R
2500|$|Practical loads have {{resistance}} {{as well as}} inductance, and/or capacitance, so both {{active and}} reactive power will flow to normal loads. [...] <b>Apparent</b> <b>power</b> {{is the product of}} the rms values of voltage and current.|$|R
50|$|Vars may be {{considered}} as either the imaginary part of <b>apparent</b> <b>power,</b> or the power flowing into a reactive load, where voltage and current are specified in volts and amperes. The two definitions are equivalent.|$|R
