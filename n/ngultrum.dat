The purchase of the two jets, valued at 3,534.36 million Bhutanese <b>ngultrum</b> (BTN), was the biggest single purchase ever made by Bhutan, and was largely responsible for a 250 percent increase in the Bhutanese trade deficit over the previous year for the financial year 2004–2005. The Bhutanese government issued BTN 1,767.18 million in government bonds to pay for one aircraft and for only the second time in Bhutan's history intended to seek a commercial loan for the other aircraft. However, in October 2004 it announced it would instead seek a soft loan for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|Thimphu is the {{political}} and economic centre of Bhutan and the location of the central government. Agriculture and livestock contribute to 45% of the GNP. The use of hydropower plants to generate electricity has also substantially contributed to the economy. Tourism is also a contributor to the economy but its adoption is on a graduated scale maintaining a balance between development and modernization. India is its major trading partner with most of the electricity produced (90%) exported to India, with imports from India limited to 70%. The <b>ngultrum</b> (ISO 4217 code BTN) (Dzongkha: དངུལ་ཀྲམ) has been the currency of Bhutan since 1974. It is subdivided into 100 chhertum (called chetrums on coins until 1979). In 1974, the <b>ngultrum</b> was introduced as the Bhutanese currency replacing the rupee at par. The <b>ngultrum</b> is equal in value to the Indian rupee, since Bhutan's economy is largely dependent on Indian financial and other forms of assistance. Although a city, agriculture is still important to Thimphu and the surrounding district. Even around the royal palace are terraced fields. The main crops grown in the area are rice, corn (maize), and wheat and the lumbering trade is also important to the economy.|$|E

The set has been reprinted in the 1950s on paper that varies from the first printing in 1954, while also the colour ink may differ. A surcharged issue on the blue 1 trangka revenue stamp had been reportedly released in 1961 or 1962, diagonally surcharged respectively with [...] "10NP" [...] and [...] "25NP" [...] (NP standing for New Paisa, so using the Indian currency), but identified as fakes originating from Kathmandu, Nepal.Only in 1966 was a new set of two revenue stamps ready for release, now in Bhutanese currency, of 10 Chetrum (red colour) and 25 Chetrum (jade colour). They were released the next year, followed shortly after by the values 20 Chetrum, 1 <b>Ngultrum</b> and 5 <b>Ngultrum.</b> They were printed at the well-known Nasik Security Press in Nasik, India. In the early 1970s the 10 CH revenue stamp was surcharged officially in purple to 15 CH.|$|E

The market also sells yak butter, cheese, wooden bowls and fabrics. A number of cheap souvenirs from Nepal are also sold at the market. Behind the open market, several shops sell Chinese and Bangladeshi crockery, appliances, shoes, silks and carpets. For many years merchants would come to the central square from all over Bhutan and market their goods and would sleep in the open air. However, in 1986, platforms were erected and in 1989 covered market halls were built over the platforms. A special building for meat products was constructed {{on the north side of}} the market. In 2006, the handicrafts section was moved to the new stalls on the other side of the new bridge, built in the traditional style in 2005.|$|E

50|$|For a {{third season}} in a row, Thimphu City, as Zimdra had now been renamed, {{finished}} as runners-up in the A-Division, winning five and drawing {{one of their}} eight games, but finishing five points behind champions Yeedzin. they performed better than the previous season in the National League finishing in third place, comfortably ahead of Druk Pol, with five wins and three draws from their eight games, but three points behind champions Ugyen Academy. Prior to 2013, Thimphu City {{had been in a}} difficult financial situation. Owner Hishey Tshering was spending a lot of his own money at the time, paying salaries and covering school fees for younger players in a football league where there is no money generated from gate receipts and sponsorship is thin on the ground. Fortunately for the club a friend of Tshering's and some other private sponsors contribute money so that the club is able to pay between 20 and 40 thousand <b>Ngultrum</b> to its players.|$|E
50|$|The {{next season}} started {{off in a}} disappointing fashion. Despite two heavy defeats of Nangpa 12-0 and 16-0, Yeedzin were beaten twice by Druk Pol and drew twice with Zimdra (now known as Thimphu City FC) to finish behind these two sides in third place, with Druk Pol taking the A-Division title. However, this was {{sufficient}} for qualification to the inaugural Bhutan National League. This new league was a genuine national competition, whereas previously the A-Division had nominally been termed the National League between 2001 and 2003, it was in practice a league for teams based in Thimphu. Yeedzin qualified along with Druk Pol and Zimdra and were joined by Phuentsholing, representing Chukha District, Samtse, representing Samtse District and Ugyen Academy, representing Punakha District. A team representing Gelephug District was supposed to enter as well but apparently did not. Yeedzin performed strongly in the competition, finishing the league after ten games unbeaten, whilst conceding only five goals. They won the league by beating Druk Pol 2-1, coming from behind following a goal for Druk Pol from Jigyel Ugyen Wangchuck to claim the 400,000 <b>Ngultrum</b> prize. Although they had lost their A-Division title, with this competition now merely being a qualifier for the new national league, Yeedzin had won their third consecutive national championship, {{the first time a}} team had achieved this feat since Transport United in 2006, the only other {{time in the history of}} Bhutanese football that this had happened.|$|E
50|$|The monastery {{underwent}} a major refurbishing from 2000, which lasted for eight years. It {{was a massive}} restoration work which was organized by the ninth Gangteng Trulku, Kunzang Rigzin Pema Namgyal (stated to be the reincarnation {{of the body of}} Pema Lingpa) at a project cost of Bhutanese <b>ngultrum</b> (Nu) 700 million “to preserve this remarkable legacy for the future.” He engaged 'Landmarks Foundation' to mobilise the restoration and preservation of the Gonpa. This was the first occasion for the Landmarks Foundation to engage in a project in which the sacred site was fully functional. The structural problems were first identified, particularly as the wooden parts which deteriorated and affected the structure. The refurbishing was planned {{in such a way as}} not to disturb “the original aura and grandeur of the monastery”. The Royal Government of Bhutan supervised the work and provided the necessary technical and architectural support, including raw materials. This building construction lasted for eight years and all efforts were made to preserve the old structures, carvings, and paintings to the extent possible, while 104 new pillars were intricately crafted by the local artisans. This task was also supported by the fourth King of Bhutan with technical support and guidance. The monastery was painted with durable special mineral paints, locally called the dotshoen. The monastery occupies a prime space in the Phobjika valley, and as built now it is a large complex consisting of the central Gonpa, surrounded by monks' living quarters, meditation halls and a guest house. It also houses a school.|$|E

However, the Bhutanese <b>Ngultrum</b> has appreciated over time, raising concerns if this is a sign of Dutch disease, shadowing the growth prospects of Bhutan. The author examines empirically the presence of Dutch disease in the Bhutanese economy. The analysis finds no evidence of a contraction or stagnation of the non-power tradable sector. While there is no imminent threat that requires urgent policy intervention, future expansion of power exports or aid inflows will likely put further downward pressure on the <b>Ngultrum,</b> and may eventually damage the non-power tradable sector. Bhutan's future economic prosperity depends crucially on the policy strategies for exchange rate management, fiscal policy and private sector development...|$|E
40|$|Bhutan {{has shown}} {{remarkable}} economic performance {{over the last}} two decades. Growth {{during the second half of}} the 1990 s was particularly strong, with annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth averaging 6. 5 percent. A large part of this performance has been supported by generous inflows of foreign aid and buoyant electricity exports to India, which have spurred growth both directly by expanding export earnings and indirectly by stimulating investment in the construction and transport industries. Growth prospects for Bhutan look bright, supported by enormous hydropower generation potential. In particular, the scheduled commissioning of the Tala hydropower project in 2005 / 06 is expected to give a major boost to growth by tripling the country's power generation capacity. While the expansion in power exports has brought significant benefits to Bhutan, there has been concern that it may not be an 'unmitigated blessing. ' Despite large net inflows of foreign capital, Bhutan's macroeconomic indicators suggest that inflation has so far been modest and under control. The results of the empirical analysis of the Bhutanese economy indeed confirm that the power exports to India as well as financial assistance have caused real appreciation of the <b>ngultrum</b> against the rupee over time, through increased private spending and short-term monetary disequilibrium. Despite the real appreciation, however, the study finds little evidence to suggest contraction or stagnation of the non-power tradable sector. While the performance of the tradable sector may have been stronger in the absence of the real appreciation, thus far there is no sign of the Dutch disease, or the Dutch condition, in the Bhutanese economy. This paper examines empirically the macroeconomic impacts of Bhutan's increased power exports to India. It is the first serious attempt to address the presence of the Dutch disease in the Bhutanese economy. Previous attempts had been hampered by lack of sufficiently long time series data. Four sets of key questions are addressed in this study: (i) what are the features of the power export boom in Bhutan? Is it a temporary or permanent phenomenon? How large are power exports? (ii) Have power exports appreciated the real value of the <b>ngultrum?</b> If so, would further increase in power exports put further upward pressure on the <b>ngultrum?</b> (iii) What have the impacts on the tradable sector been? Are there Dutch-disease symptoms? (iv) Are these impacts sizable enough to require policy interventions? If so, what kind of policy options is then available to the Government...|$|E
