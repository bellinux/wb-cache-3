Rick Paul, the adult son of another teacher, was also killed by friendly fire {{as he ran}} an American road block. Also killed was a Spanish freelance press photographer on assignment for El Pais, Juan Antonio Rodriguez Moreno. Rodriguez was killed outside of the Marriott Hotel in Panama City early on December 21. In June 1990, his family filed a claim for wrongful death against the United States Government. When the Rodriguez claim {{was rejected by the}} US government, in 1992 the Spanish government sent a <b>Note</b> <b>Verbale</b> extending diplomatic protection to Rodriguez and demanding compensation on behalf of his family. However, the US government again rejected the claim, disputing both its liability for warzone deaths in general and whether Rodriguez had been killed by US rather than Panamanian gunfire.|$|E

5000|$|The {{position}} of China on its maritime claims based on UNCLOS and {{history has been}} ambiguous, particularly with the nine dash line map. For example, in its <b>notes</b> <b>verbales</b> in 2011, the first phrase stated that China has undisputed sovereignty over the islands and the adjacent waters, suggesting China is claiming sovereignty over its territorial waters, a position consistent with UNCLOS. However, the second phrase in its <b>notes</b> <b>verbales</b> stated that China enjoys sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the relevant waters along with the seabed and subsoil contained in this region, suggesting that China is claiming sovereignty over all of the maritime space (includes all the geographic features and the waters within the nine dash line). The third phrase indicates support for basing their claims on historical basis as well. Recently in its <b>notes</b> <b>verbales</b> in 2011, China has explicitly stated that it claims the territorial waters {{and all of the}} islands in which each island has its own exclusive economic zone and continental shelf. A major problem with this claim is that it fails to distinguish between geographic features considered as [...] "islands" [...] or [...] "rocks" [...] under UNCLOS. The vast majority of international legal experts have concluded that China's claims based on historical claims are invalid. Many ambiguities arise from the notion of historical claims as a basis for claiming sovereignty and is inherently ambiguous.|$|R

The U-shaped line is a legal conundrum not only for China but also for the world community, particularly after the map with the U-shaped line, together with China's <b>Notes</b> <b>Verbale</b> with respect to the claims to the outer continental shelves made by Malaysia and Vietnam, were submitted to the UN Commission on the Limits of Continental Shelf in May 2009.

The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the motivations behind the positions held by China, Vietnam, and the Philippines regarding the South China Sea dispute. Interviews, governmental speeches and documents, <b>notes</b> <b>verbales,</b> treaties, and data generated by various governmental agencies were among the sources used to quantitatively and qualitatively explain their positions. It argues, generally, that the policies of the three nations are meant to address other, mainly domestic, but also international, concerns of an economic, political, military, and social nature, both current and historical. Specifically, China’s is vague, non-conforming, maximalist, and aggressive, yet measured, and is intended to maintain its stature as a world leader, which in turn helps in terms of regime survival and support at home. Vietnam’s is nationalistic, expansionistic, and protectionist in its position as well as continuing uninhibited oil and natural gas exploration in which it favors foreign sales. These positions reflect its historical fear of and resistance to external encroachment, its general policy orientation toward popular mobilization and control of the population, and its emphasis on economic security. The Philippines’s position, being the weakest and least effective bilaterally or multilaterally, is mainly rhetorical and meant for domestic, political consumption. It therefore focuses on legalistic approaches while promising to accommodate internal power centers, and notably the military. It aims to use whatever windfall there might be from the SCS’s oil and gas reserves to combat socioeconomic inequalities and rectify its tarnished national identity internally and externally...|$|R

An article in the American Journal of International Law argued in 1987 that [...] "the course of the American warships indicated on a map published in Izvestiia confirms that the passage of the vessels was a lateral one" [...] and that [...] "at no time did they take a course that could be construed as expressing an intention to enter the internal waters or ports of the USSR".|$|E
5000|$|On 3 March 2017, Dutch prime {{minister}} Mark Rutte got confirmation from the Turkish authorities that a campaign manifestation was planned on Dutch territory, on 11 March. That day he announced on his Facebook page that the Dutch authorities would not cooperate. On 6 March, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs received diplomatic mail requesting {{the admission of}} the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu {{with the intention of}} attending a campaign meeting. The same day, the Dutch foreign minister Bert Koenders replied in a <b>note</b> <b>verbale</b> that such a visit would not be allowed. This led to a series of telephonic contacts between Koenders and Çavuşoğlu, as well as between Rutte and the Turkish {{prime minister}} Binali Yıldırım. According to Çavuşoğlu, the Dutch government told him that it objected to a visit because it feared that it would lead to an electoral victory of the anti-Islamic Party for Freedom. The Dutch government has denied that such a motive was ever communicated to Çavuşoğlu. Dutch diplomatic sources have indicated that Çavuşoğlu offered Koenders to postpone a visit to a date after the Dutch elections on 15 March, e.g. to 18 March, but that this option was refused by Koenders who wanted to avoid any suggestion of a connection between the two events, fearing it might give the impression that the Dutch government deliberately escalated the situation. As an alternative for a ministerial visit to a mass gathering, the Dutch authorities offered to allow the visit of Turkish ex-parliamentarians, or Çavuşoğlu visiting some closed session. When no consensus was reached, the Dutch made a final offer on 10 March: Çavuşoğlu would be allowed access to the Turkish embassy in The Hague. This was accepted by the Turks. Then the Dutch demanded that no more than fifty people were invited to the meeting and the session would not be made public beforehand. While Turkey considered this condition, a third one was made in the evening: the names of those invited would have to be disclosed beforehand to the Dutch authorities. On 11 March 03:00, it was added that if Turkey would not accept this offer, landing rights might be refused. Turkey considered this to be an unacceptable infringement on its sovereignty and a deliberate attempt by the Dutch to sabotage the visit. Koenders told the Dutch press that the Netherlands would not facilitate a planned visit by Çavuşoğlu to Rotterdam on 11 March, meaning that he would not meet with Çavuşoğlu in any official capacity and that the Dutch state would not provide support in any way during his planned visit. Koenders cited risks to public order and security for the decision, and further stated that, although the Dutch government did not approve of the planned visit, he would not infringe upon the constitutional right of freedom of assembly. Çavuşoğlu was very dismayed by what he saw as a Dutch ultimatum. He publicly requested [...] "all Turkish citizens in the Netherlands" [...] to come to the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam on 11 March. In an interview with CNN Türk around 09:00 he claimed to have been threatened by the Netherlands and announced [...] "heavy sanctions" [...] if his visit was prevented. Koenders watched the CNN programme; when he heard the remarks by Çavuşoğlu, he said [...] "This is the signal" [...] and immediately phoned Rutte. On 11 March, around 10:00, Rutte denied Çavuşoğlu's government plane the right to land on Dutch soil.Meanwhile, Geert Wilders, the leader of the anti-Islamic Party for Freedom, had on 8 March demonstrated against the visit in front of the Turkish embassy in The Hague, heading a small group of party candidates. Together with member of parliament Sietse Fritsma, he held a banner with the words Blijf Weg! Dit is ons land ("Stay Away! This is our country"). On 11 March, Wilders too became aware of Çavuşoğlu's remarks; on 11:20 he sent a tweet to his many Twitter followers to re-tweet to Rutte: [...] "don't let the Turkish minister into the country; do NOT let him land here". Later that day, Wilders in an interview with Al Jazeera claimed it was pressure from his party that convinced Rutte not to grant landing rights.|$|E

40|$|Overview Advances in {{information}} communication technology are dramatically improving real-time communication and information-sharing. By improving {{access to information}} and facilitating global debate, they foster democratic participation. By amplifying the voices of human rights defenders and helping to expose abuses, these powerful technologies offer the promise of improved enjoyment of human rights. But {{at the same time}} it has become clear that these new technologies are vulnerable to electronic surveillance and interception. Recent discoveries have revealed how new technologies are being developed covertly, often to facilitate these practices, with chilling efficiency. As the High Commissioner has cautioned in her recent statements [September 2013 and February 2014], such surveillance threatens individual rights – including to privacy and to freedom of expression and association – and inhibits the free functioning of a vibrant civil society. International legal framework In December 2013, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 68 / 167, which expresses deep concern at the negative impact that surveillance and interception of communications may have on human rights. The General Assembly affirmed that the rights held by people offline must also be protected online, and it called upon all States to respect and protect the right to privacy in digital communication. The General Assembly called on all States to review their procedures, practices and legislation related to communications surveillance, interception and collection of personal data and emphasized the need for States to ensure the full and effective implementation of their obligations under international human rights law. As General Assembly resolution 68 / 167 recalls, international human rights law provides the universal framework against which any interference in individual privacy rights must be assessed. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to date ratified by 167 States, provides that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his or her honour and reputation. It further states that “Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks. ” Other international human rights instruments contain similar provisions. While the right to privacy under international human rights law is not absolute, any instance of interference must be subject to a careful and critical assessment of its necessity, legitimacy and proportionality. NEW report of the High Commissioner Through the adoption of resolution 68 / 167, the General Assembly requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights prepare this report on the right to privacy in the digital age. It examines, in the words of the resolution:  “the protection and promotion of the right to privacy in the context of domestic and extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of digital communications and collection of personal data, including on a mass scale”. The report was presented to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-seventh session and to the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. To prepare for this report, OHCHR conducted research, consulted with various stakeholders, and liaised with partners within and beyond the UN system. The Office has encouraged all interested parties to share information and perspectives on the issues raised in resolution 68 / 167. [See <b>Note</b> <b>Verbale</b> to Member States...|$|E
