40|$|Abstract — Computer {{networks}} have progressed from a sim-ple store-and-forward medium {{to a complex}} communication infrastructure. Routers in the network need to implement a variety of functions ranging from simple packet classification for forwarding and firewalling to complex payload modifications for encryption and content adaptation. As these functions increase in number and complexity, more processing time is required, and packets experience a significant processing delay. In most network simulations, this delay has not been addressed because it was con-sidered negligible. However, we show that this <b>network</b> <b>processing</b> <b>delay</b> can reach the magnitude of long-distance propagation delay and thus becomes a significant contributor to the overall packet delay. We evaluate different network applications and develop a model that characterizes packet processing cost {{with only a few}} parameters that can easily be derived from our simulations. To validate our simulation and our model, we compare them to actual network measurements. The contributions of this work can be used to increase the accuracy of network simulations and improve network performance estimations. I...|$|E

If a processor fails, it will only affect one section of the plant process, as opposed to a failure of a central computer which would affect the whole process. This distribution of computing power local to the field Input/Output (I/O) field connection racks also ensures fast controller processing times by removing possible <b>network</b> and central <b>processing</b> <b>delays.</b>|$|R

40|$|OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is {{a widely}} used intra-domain routing {{protocol}} in IP <b>networks.</b> Internal <b>processing</b> <b>delays</b> in OSPF implementations impact {{the speed at which}} updates propagate in the network, the load on individual routers, and the time needed for both intradomain and inter-domain routing to reconverge following an internal topology or a configuration change. An OSPF user, such as an Internet Service Provider, typically has no access to the software implementation, and no way to estimate these delays directly. In this paper, we present blackbox methods (i. e., measurements that rely only on external observations) for estimating and trending delays for key internal tasks in OSPF: processing Link State Advertisements (LSAs), performing Shortest Path First calculations, updating the Forwarding Information Base, and flooding LSAs. Corresponding measurements are reported for production routers from Cisco Systems. To help validate the methodology, black-box and white-box (i. e., measurements that rely on internal instrumentation) are reported for a open source OSPF implementation, GateD.

Advanced {{metering}} infrastructure (AMI) initiatives are a popular tool to incorporate changes for modernizing the electricity grid, reduce peak loads, and meet energy efficiency targets. There is the looming issue of how to communicate and handle consumer data collected by electric utilities and manage limited communication network resources. Several data relay points are required to collect data distributedly and send them through a communication backhaul. This paper studies the smart meter message concatenation (SMMC) {{problem of how to}} efficiently concatenate multiple small smart metering messages arriving at data concentrator units in order to reduce protocol overhead and thus network utilization. This problem needs to deal with the added constraint that each originating message from its source may have its own stated deadline that {{must be taken into account}} during the concatenation process. This paper provides hardness results for the SMMC problem, and proposes six heuristics and evaluates them to gain a better understanding of the best data volume reduction policies that can be applied at data concentrators of AMI infrastructures. These results are further tested for feasibility under practical settings based on aspects, such as <b>network</b> and <b>processing</b> <b>delays,</b> tightness of application deadlines, and lossy backhaul links.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robust telerobotic system {{that consists of}} a real-time vision-based operator hand tracking system (client) and a slave robot (server) which are interconnected by using a LAN. The tracking system (1) monitors the operator hand motion and (2) determine its position and orientation which are used to control the slave robot. Two digital cameras are used to monitor a four-ball called feature frame that is held by the operator hand. To determine the 3 D position a tracking algorithm uses uncalibrated cameras together with the a±ne invariant property. This allows ¯nding 3 D di®erential position and orientation of operator hand. The features of proposed systems are (1) a metric for color matching to discriminate the balls from their background, (2) a uniform and spiral search approaches to speedup the detection, (3) tracking {{in the presence of}} partial occluding, (4) consolidate detection by using shape and geometric matching, and (5) dynamic update of the reference colors. The operator can see the e®ects of the previous motion which enables making the necessary corrections through repetitive operator hand-eye interactions. In the evaluation we study the static and dynamic errors of the tracking system as well as combined errors due to the a±ne invariant transformation. We also present the telerobotic real-time control scheme and its <b>network</b> and <b>processing</b> <b>delays.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} network architecture on control performance {{in a class of}} distributed control systems called networked control systems (NCSs) and provides design considerations related to control quality of performance as well as network quality of service. The integrated network-control system changes the characteristics of time delays between application devices. This study first identifies several key components of the time delay through an analysis of network protocols and control dynamics. The analysis of network and control parameters is used to determine an acceptable working range of sampling periods in an NCS. A network-control simulator and an experimental networked machine tool have been developed to help validate and demonstrate the performance analysis results and identify the special performance characteristics in an NCS. These performance characteristics are useful guidelines for choosing the network and control parameters when designing an NCS.

For example, in [20] the authors present a concept of fog computing and define its main characteristics, such as location awareness, reduced latency and general QoS improvements. They focus on defining a virtualized platform that includes the edge devices and enables running custom application logic atop different resources throughout the network. Similarly, Cloudlets [6] and small clouds [21] are introduced as intermediary infrastructure nodes (between the edge devices and data centers), {{which can be used}} to reduce <b>network</b> <b>delays,</b> <b>processing</b> time and costs. The SDG-Pro framework also aims at better utilization of the edge infrastructure, but we focus on providing a systematic approach, supporting application developers to address most of the infrastructure provisioning and governance issues programmatically, in a logically centralized fashion, by offering the software-defined gateways and well-defined provisioning and governance APIs.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} link {{utilization}} estimation {{scheme based on}} Round-Trip Time (RTT) measurement with consideration of the <b>processing</b> <b>delay</b> jitter and practical timer granularity. In a previous work, RTT measurements are used to estimate link utilization from a probability distribution of the minimum RTTs on a link where the RTT variation {{is considered to be}} caused by only queuing delay. However, the original RTT-based scheme has problems with the two factors of <b>processing</b> <b>delay</b> jitter and actual timer granularity. The first problem is that <b>processing</b> <b>delay</b> jitter is only one cause of RTT variation. The observer cannot differentiate the impact of queuing from that of processing. The second problem is that measuring the minimum RTT is difficult if the timing accuracy is of the order of micro-seconds because an observer cannot determine whether an RTT value is minimum or not. The proposed scheme, which extends the previous scheme, identifies and eliminates the effects of <b>processing</b> <b>delay</b> jitter and estimates the probability of the minimum RTT with micro-second order timer granularity. The former is achieved with division by an appearance probability value of the <b>processing</b> <b>delays</b> at the ingress and egress nodes of a targeted link from the estimated RTTs on the target link. To realize the latter, the proposed scheme sets a suitable range from estimated RTTs on a target link. Experiments show that the proposed scheme effectively eliminates the jitter effects under low load with a 0. 2 reduction in deviation from the true value.
