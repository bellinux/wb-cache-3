5|$|Both innate and {{adaptive}} immunity {{depend on the}} ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and <b>non-self</b> molecules. In immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. Conversely, <b>non-self</b> molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of <b>non-self</b> molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.|$|E
5|$|Fellows {{is among}} the {{earliest}} cases where the Supreme Court applied treaties, including treaties between the United States and Native American tribes, as binding law. Fellows has been cited as authority for the enrolled treaty doctrine; analogous to the enrolled bill rule for statutes, the enrolled treaty doctrine prevents inquiry into {{the legitimacy of the}} formation of treaties once ratified by the Senate. This doctrine was later used to deny relief (or, to deny more relief) to Native American tribes who claimed that treaties were entered into fraudulently or signed by persons without authority to bind the tribe. Fellows was also decided before the Supreme Court began distinguishing between self-executing and <b>non-self</b> executing treaties. Regardless, treaties between the United States and Native Americans continued to be regarded as self-executing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of normal immune response, parts of {{pathogens}} (e.g. bacteria) are recognized by the immune system as foreign (<b>non-self),</b> and eliminated or effectively neutralized to reduce their potential damage. Such a recognizable substance is called an antigen. The immune system may respond in multiple ways to an antigen; a key feature of this response is the production of antibodies by B cells (or B lymphocytes) involving {{an arm of the}} immune system known as humoral immunity. The antibodies are soluble and do not require direct cell-to-cell contact between the pathogen and the B-cell to function.|$|E
25|$|Such immunoglobulin-mediated binding of the {{complement}} may {{be interpreted}} as that the complement uses {{the ability of the}} immunoglobulin to detect and bind to <b>non-self</b> antigens as its guiding stick. The complement itself is able to bind <b>non-self</b> pathogens after detecting their pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), however, utilizing specificity of antibody, complements are able to detect <b>non-self</b> enemies much more specifically.|$|E
25|$|Realizing {{the real}} nature of skandhas, {{both in terms}} of impermanence and <b>non-self,</b> is {{necessary}} for nirvana.|$|E
25|$|The Buddhist scriptures {{assert that}} all five skhandhas have three {{characteristics}} often called ti-lakkhana (tri-lakshana, three marks). These are Dukkha, Anicca (impermanence) and Anatta (<b>non-Self).</b>|$|E
25|$|In their {{development}} in the thymus, T lymphocytes are selected to recognize MHC molecules of the host, but not recognize other self antigens. Following selection, each T lymphocyte shows dual specificity: The TCR recognizes self MHC, but only <b>non-self</b> antigens.|$|E
25|$|HLA {{antibodies}} {{are typically}} not naturally occurring, and {{with few exceptions}} are formed {{as a result of}} an immunologic challenge to a foreign material containing <b>non-self</b> HLAs via blood transfusion, pregnancy (paternally inherited antigens), or organ or tissue transplant.|$|E
25|$|Is {{involved}} in differentiating {{between self and}} <b>non-self</b> mRNA. Without 2′-O-methylation activity the immune system triggers higher levels of type 1 interferon activity. It is also seen that the 2′-O-methylation occurs in plants and animals to help protect the 3' end of miRNA(microRNA) from polyadenylation.|$|E
25|$|The {{proteins}} encoded by HLAs {{are those}} on the outer part of body cells that are (in effect) unique to that person. The immune system uses the HLAs to differentiate self cells and <b>non-self</b> cells. Any cell displaying that person's HLA type belongs to that person and, therefore, is not an invader.|$|E
25|$|Right Resolve: {{the giving}} up home and {{adopting}} {{the life of}} a religious mendicant in order to follow the path; this concept aims at peaceful renunciation, into an environment of non-sensuality, non-ill-will (to loving kindness), away from cruelty (to compassion). Such an environment aids contemplation of impermanence, suffering, and <b>non-Self.</b>|$|E
25|$|French Polynesia was relisted in the UN List of <b>Non-Self</b> Governing Territories in 2013, {{making it}} {{eligible}} for a UN-backed independence referendum. The relisting was made after its indigenous government was voiced {{and supported by the}} Polynesian Leaders Group, Pacific Conference of Churches, Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom, Non-Aligned Movement, World Council of Churches, and Melanesian Spearhead Group.|$|E
25|$|In a cell, protein {{molecules}} of the host's own phenotype or of other biologic entities are continually synthesized and degraded. Each MHC molecule {{on the cell}} surface displays a molecular fraction of a protein, called an epitope. The presented antigen can be either self or <b>non-self,</b> thus preventing an organism's immune system targeting its own cells. In its entirety, the MHC population is like a meter indicating the balance of proteins within the cell.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance is a {{fundamental}} property of the immune system. Tolerance involves <b>non-self</b> discrimination which {{is the ability of}} the normal immune system to recognize and respond to foreign antigens, but not self antigens. Autoimmunity is evoked when this tolerance to self antigen is broken. Tolerance within an individual is normally evoked as a fetus. This is known as maternal-fetal tolerance where B cells expressing receptors specific for a particular antigen enter the circulation of the developing fetus via the placenta.|$|E
25|$|While a {{high level}} of {{autoimmunity}} is unhealthy, a low level of autoimmunity may actually be beneficial. Taking the experience of a beneficial factor in autoimmunity further, one might hypothesize with intent to prove that autoimmunity is always a self-defense mechanism of the mammal system to survive. The system does not randomly lose the ability to distinguish between self and <b>non-self,</b> the attack on cells may be the consequence of cycling metabolic processes necessary to keep the blood chemistry in homeostasis.|$|E
25|$|Veterinarians also {{administer}} transfusions {{to other}} animals. Various species require {{different levels of}} testing to ensure a compatible match. For example, cats have 3 known blood types, cattle have 11, dogs have 12, pigs 16 and horses have 34. However, in many species (especially horses and dogs), cross matching is not required before the first transfusion, as antibodies against <b>non-self</b> cell surface antigens are not expressed constitutively – i.e. the animal has to be sensitized before it will mount an immune response against the transfused blood.|$|E
25|$|The {{state of}} nirvana is also {{described}} in Buddhism as cessation of all afflictions, cessation of all actions, cessation of rebirths and suffering {{that are a}} consequence of afflictions and actions. Liberation is described as identical to anatta (anatman, <b>non-self,</b> lack of any self). In Buddhism, liberation is achieved when all things and beings are understood to be with no Self. Nirvana is also described as identical to achieving sunyata (emptiness), {{where there is no}} essence or fundamental nature in anything, and everything is empty.|$|E
25|$|In SCNT, {{not all of}} {{the donor}} cell's genetic {{information}} is transferred, as the donor cell's mitochondria that contain their own mitochondrial DNA are left behind. The resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg. As a consequence, clones such as Dolly that are born from SCNT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus. This fact may also hamper the potential benefits of SCNT derived tissues/organs for therapy, as there may be an immunoresponse to the <b>non-self</b> mtDNA after transplant.|$|E
25|$|Prajñā (Sanskrit) or paññā (Pāli) is insight or {{knowledge}} of {{the true nature of}} existence. The Buddhist tradition regards ignorance (avidyā), a fundamental ignorance, misunderstanding or mis-perception of the nature of reality, as one of the basic causes of dukkha and samsara. By overcoming ignorance or misunderstanding one is enlightened and liberated. This overcoming includes awakening to impermanence and the <b>non-self</b> nature of reality, and this develops dispassion for the objects of clinging, and liberates a being from dukkha and saṃsāra. Prajñā is important in all Buddhist traditions, and is the wisdom about the dharmas, functioning of karma and rebirths, realms of samsara, impermanence of everything, no-self in anyone or anything, and dependent origination.|$|E
25|$|Before the 19th century, the British {{upper classes}} enjoyed a life {{relatively}} free from taxation. Staff were plentiful and cheap, and estates not only provided a generous income from tenanted land but also political power. During the 19th century this began to change, until by the mid-20th century {{they had no}} power and were suffering heavy taxation. The staff had either been killed in two world wars or forsaken a life of servitude for better wages elsewhere. Thus the owners of large country houses dependent on staff and a large income began by necessity to dispose of their costly <b>non-self</b> sustaining material assets. Large houses had become redundant white elephants to be abandoned or demolished. It seemed that in particular regard to the country houses no one was prepared to save them.|$|E
25|$|Other {{similarities}} {{include the}} immunological {{memory of the}} adaptive immune system in vertebrates and the observation that a similar collective memory (operating with a yet-to-be-explained mechanism) occurs in some insect societies e.g. individual Z. angusticollis survive M. anisopliae infections significantly more when {{they have been in}} contact with a previously infected conspecifc, a 'social transfer of immunity' or 'social vaccination'. Transplant rejection caused by <b>non-self</b> major histocompatibility complexes is frequently thought to be a byproduct with no evolutionary function, however Cremer cites cases (such as the colonial star ascidian (Botryllus schlosseri)) where recognizing foreign cells may have evolved as an adaptation - if so, then this could be analogous to the self-recognition systems in social insects which prevent brood parasitism and the worker policing behaviours which suppress 'social tumours'. Specific immune cells in animals 'patrol' tissues looking for parasites, as do worker-caste individuals in colonies.|$|E
25|$|Another {{autonomous}} {{philosophy of}} biology {{is represented by}} Guenther Witzany and his theory of biocommunication: Living nature is structured and organized by language and communication within and among cells, tissues, organs and organisms. This means that besides human language and communication every living entity is competent to use signs with which it can differentiate between self and <b>non-self.</b> The communicative competence serves for coordination of group behavior (tissues, organs, organisms). Biocommunication research is applied to all organismic kingdoms based on empirical data. Additionally the biocommunication method investigates nucleotide sequences as natural code which is structured according combinatorial, context-sensitive and content-specific rules. Natural genome editing from a biocommunicative perspective consequently is investigated as competent agent-driven generation and integration of meaningful nucleotide sequences into pre-existing genomic content arrangements of host organisms. Such natural genome editing agents can (re)combine and (re)regulate host genome content according to context-dependent (i.e. adaptational) purposes. Such active agent-driven processes contradict passive error replication (mutation) narratives to explain emergence of genetic diversity.|$|E
25|$|Peter Medawar was a {{zoologist}} turned clinician, {{who specialized}} in burn trauma. A plane crash near his home changed the path of his career, turning his work with burns from mere academia to a full on quest to save lives. Medawar and a Scottish surgeon, Tom Gibson, were tasked with working the Burns Unit of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. The first insight came when the pair decided to experiment, and grafted part of a wound with the patient's skin, and another part with skin from the patient's brother. Within days the skin grafts from the brother were completely destroyed. Successive skin grafts from the brother were destroyed even faster, a fact that gave them the evidence they needed to implicate the immune system. Medawar later repeated this experiment on rabbits and 625 surgeries later validated their initial conclusions. Medawar then set out {{in search of the}} reason why rabbits rejected <b>non-self</b> grafts.|$|E
25|$|Buddhism is a {{religion}} of self-examination. The natural aim of the Buddhist life {{is the state of}} enlightenment, gradually cultivated through meditation and other spiritual practices. Humility, in this context, is a characteristic that is both {{an essential part of the}} spiritual practice, and a result of it. As a quality to be developed, it is deeply connected with the practice of Four Abodes (Brahmavihara): love-kindness, compassion, empathetic joy and equanimity. As a result of the practice, this cultivated humility is expanded by the wisdom acquired by the experience of ultimate emptiness (Shunyata) and <b>non-self</b> (Anatta). Humility, compassion, and wisdom are intrinsic parts of the state of enlightenment. On the other hand, not being humble is an obstacle on the path of enlightenment which needs to be overcome. In the Tipitaka (the Buddhist scriptures), criticizing others and praising oneself is considered a vice; but criticizing oneself and praising others is considered a virtue. Attachment to the self, apart from being a vice in itself, also leads to other evil states, that create suffering.|$|E
500|$|Part 1 (Article 1) {{recognises}} {{the right}} of all peoples to self-determination, {{including the right to}} [...] "freely determine their political status", pursue their economic, social and cultural goals, and manage and dispose of their own resources. It recognises a negative right of a people not to be deprived of its means of subsistence, and imposes an obligation on those parties still responsible for <b>non-self</b> governing and trust territories (colonies) to encourage and respect their self-determination.|$|E
500|$|Overactive immune {{responses}} {{comprise the}} other end of immune dysfunction, particularly the autoimmune disorders. Here, the immune system fails to properly distinguish between self and <b>non-self,</b> and attacks part of the body. Under normal circumstances, many T cells and antibodies react with [...] "self" [...] peptides. One of the functions of specialized cells (located in the thymus and bone marrow) is to present young lymphocytes with self antigens produced throughout the body and to eliminate those cells that recognize self-antigens, preventing autoimmunity.|$|E
500|$|Burnet {{began to}} switch his focus to {{immunology}} in the 1940s. In 1941 {{he wrote a}} monograph called [...] "The Production of Antibodies", which was revised and reissued in 1949 with Frank Fenner as a co-author. This book {{is seen as a}} key publication in immunology—it marks the move from the study of immunology as a chemical endeavour to a biological one. Importantly in this work, he introduced the concept of [...] "self" [...] and [...] "non-self" [...] to immunology. The distinction between self and <b>non-self</b> {{was an integral part of}} Burnet's biological outlook, of his interest in the living organism in its totality, its activities, and interactions. Burnet regarded the [...] "self" [...] of the host body as being actively defined during its embryogenesis through complex interactions between immune cells and all the other cells and molecules within an embryo.|$|E
500|$|Phagocytosis {{is common}} and {{probably}} appeared early in evolution, [...] evolving first in unicellular eukaryotes. Amoebae are unicellular protists that {{separated from the}} tree leading to metazoa shortly after the divergence of plants, and they share many specific functions with mammalian phagocytic cells. [...] Dictyostelium discoideum, for example, is an amoeba that lives in the soil and feeds on bacteria. Like animal phagocytes, it engulfs bacteria by phagocytosis mainly through Toll-like receptors, and it has other biological functions in common with macrophages. [...] Dictyostelium discoideum is social; it aggregates when starved to form a migrating pseudoplasmodium or slug. This multicellular organism eventually will produce a fruiting body with spores that are resistant to environmental dangers. Before the formation of fruiting bodies, the cells will migrate as a slug-like organism for several days. During this time, exposure to toxins or bacterial pathogens {{has the potential to}} compromise survival of the species by limiting spore production. Some of the amoebae engulf bacteria and absorb toxins while circulating within the slug, and these amoebae eventually die. They are genetically identical to the other amoebae in the slug; their self-sacrifice to protect the other amoebae from bacteria is similar to the self-sacrifice of phagocytes seen in the immune system of higher vertebrates. This ancient immune function in social amoebae suggests an evolutionarily conserved cellular foraging mechanism that might have been adapted to defense functions well before the diversification of amoebae into higher forms. However, a common ancestry with mammalian phagocytes has not been proven. Phagocytes occur throughout the animal kingdom, from marine sponges to insects and lower and higher vertebrates. The ability of amoebae to distinguish between self and <b>non-self</b> is a pivotal one, and is the root of the immune system of many species of amoeba.|$|E
500|$|A genet is a {{group of}} genetically {{identical}} individuals that have grown in a given location, all originating vegetatively from a single ancestor. Once established, genets vegetatively spread hyphae out from the root tip into the soil and may connect two or more trees to form a network of mycorrhizae. In field studies, the approximate size of fungal genets is typically estimated by collecting and mapping fruit bodies on a site, determining which fruit bodies are genetically identical by either somatic incompatibility (a method fungi use to distinguish self from <b>non-self</b> by delimiting their own mycelia from that of other individuals of the same species) or various molecular techniques, and then determining the distance between identical fruit bodies. In a 1996 study, mycologists Monique Gardes and Thomas Bruns hypothesized that S.pungens, an abundant fruiter in pine forests, would be dominant on the roots of the pine trees. However, by sampling underground ectomycorrhizae in addition to above-ground fruit bodies, they found that the fungus can fruit prolifically while occupying {{only a small fraction of}} the ectomycorrhizal root assemblage, which was otherwise dominated by Russula species and Tomentella sublilacina. Gardes and Bruns hypothesized that the disparity between above- and below-ground representation may be because the fungus invests less energy in vegetative growth and persistence and more in fruiting, or alternatively, because the species is particularly efficient at acquiring carbon from its hosts and so needs to colonize only a few rootlets to obtain enough to allow abundant fruiting. A 1998 study by Pierluigi Bonello and colleagues used single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis to detect minute genetic differences among S.pungens genets, and showed that most of the fruiting occurred from a single large genet. This result indicates that the fungus persists because of extensive vegetative growth, rather than frequent establishment of new genets from spores, and that it uses carbon resources efficiently. The study also described an S.pungens genet with an area of approximately [...] and a span greater than [...] across, which was at the time the largest EM fungal genet reported. The large S.pungens genet was not detected after wildfire, demonstrating that it did not survive in the absence of a host, and suggesting that spores are the primary means by which the fungus recolonizes after a fire.|$|E
2500|$|Cessation of [...] can be {{obtained}} by following the Noble Eightfold Path. In Theravada Buddhism, the cessation results from the gaining of true insight into impermanence and <b>non-self.</b> The 'insight meditation' practice of Buddhism, states Kevin Trainor, focuses on gaining [...] "right mindfulness" [...] which entails understanding three marks of existence - dukkha (suffering), anicca (impermanence) and anatta (<b>non-self).</b> The understanding of the reality of <b>non-self,</b> adds Trainor, promotes non-attachment because [...] "if there is no soul, then there is no locus for clinging". Once one comprehends and accepts the <b>non-self</b> doctrine, there are no more desires, i.e. taṇhā ceases.|$|E

2500|$|Samsara ends {{when one}} attains moksha, liberation. In early Buddhism, Nirvana, the [...] "blowing out" [...] of desire, is moksha. In later Buddhism insight becomes predominant, {{for example the}} {{recognition}} and acceptance of <b>non-self,</b> also called the anatta doctrine. One who no longer sees any soul or self, concludes Walpola Rahula, {{is the one who}} has been liberated from the samsara suffering cycles. The theme that Nirvana is <b>non-Self,</b> states Peter Harvey, is recurring in early Buddhist texts.|$|E
