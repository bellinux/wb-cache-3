50|$|Under the International Code of Zoological <b>Nomenclature</b> (<b>Code),</b> the name-bearing type is the {{biological}} type that determines {{the application of}} a name. Each taxon regulated by the Code at least potentially has a name-bearing type. The name-bearing type can be either a type genus (family group), type species (genus group), or one or more type specimens (species group). For example, the name Mabuya maculata (Gray, 1839) has often been used for the Noronha skink (currently Trachylepis atlantica), but because the name-bearing type of the former, a lizard preserved in the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris, does not represent the same species as the Noronha skink, the name maculata cannot be used for the latter.|$|E
25|$|In his {{landmark}} publications, {{such as the}} Systema Naturae, Carl Linnaeus used {{a ranking}} scale limited to: kingdom, class, order, genus, species, and one rank below species.

In addition, the domain (proposed by Carl Woese) is now widely used {{as one of the}} fundamental ranks, although it is not mentioned in any of the <b>nomenclature</b> <b>codes.</b> Also, this term represents a synonym for the category of dominion (lat. dominium), introduced by Moore in 1974. Unlike Moore, Whoese et al. (1990) did not suggest a Latin term for this category, which represents a further argument supporting the accurately introduced term dominion.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Concept {{indexing}} is {{a popular}} method for characterizing medical text, {{and is one of}} the most important early steps in many data mining efforts. Concept indexing differs from simple word or phrase indexing because concepts are typically represented by a <b>nomenclature</b> <b>code</b> that binds a medical concept to all equivalent representations. A concept search on the term renal cell carcinoma would be expected to find occurrences of hypernephroma, and renal carcinoma (concept equivalents). The purpose of this study is to provide freely available resources to compare speed and performance among different autocoders. These tools consist of: 1) a public domain autocoder written in Perl (a free and open source programming language that installs on any operating system); 2) a nomenclature database derived from the unencumbered subset of the publicly available Unified Medical Language System; 3) a large corpus of autocoded output derived from a publicly available medical text. Methods A simple lexical autocoder was written that parses plain-text into a listing of all 1, 2, 3, and 4 -word strings contained in text, assigning a <b>nomenclature</b> <b>code</b> for text strings that match terms in the nomenclature. The nomenclature used is the unencumbered subset of the 2003 Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). The unencumbered subset of UMLS was reduced to exclude homonymous one-word terms and proper names, resulting in a term/code data dictionary containing about a half million medical terms. The Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), a 92 + Megabyte publicly available medical opus, was used as sample medical text for the autocoder. Results The autocoding Perl script is remarkably short, consisting of just 38 command lines. The 92 + Megabyte OMIM file was completely autocoded in 869 seconds on a 2. 4 GHz processor (less than 10 seconds per Megabyte of text). The autocoded output file (9, 540, 442 bytes) contains 367, 963 coded terms from OMIM and is distributed with this manuscript. Conclusions A public domain Perl script is provided that can parse through plain-text files of any length, matching concepts against an external nomenclature. The script and associated files can be used freely to compare the speed and performance of autocoding software. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Extensive mapping {{efforts are}} {{currently}} underway {{for the establishment}} of comparative genomics between the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana and various Brassica species. Most of these studies have deployed RFLP markers, the use of which is a laborious and time-consuming process. We therefore tested the efficacy of PCR-based Intron Polymorphism (IP) markers to analyze genome-wide synteny between the oilseed crop, Brassica juncea (AABB genome) and A. thaliana and analyzed the arrangement of 24 (previously described) genomic block segments in the A, B and C Brassica genomes to study the evolutionary events contributing to karyotype variations in the three diploid Brassica genomes. Results IP markers were highly efficient and generated easily discernable polymorphisms on agarose gels. Comparative analysis of the segmental organization of the A and B genomes of B. juncea (present study) with the A and B genomes of B. napus and B. nigra respectively (described earlier), revealed a high degree of colinearity suggesting minimal macro-level changes after polyploidization. The ancestral block arrangements that remained unaltered during evolution and the karyotype rearrangements that originated in the Oleracea lineage after its divergence from Rapa lineage were identified. Genomic rearrangements leading to the gain or loss of one chromosome each between the A-B and A-C lineages were deciphered. Complete homoeology in terms of block organization was found between three linkage groups (LG) each for the A-B and A-C genomes. Based on the homoeology shared between the A, B and C genomes, a new nomenclature for the B genome LGs was assigned to establish uniformity in the international Brassica LG <b>nomenclature</b> <b>code.</b> Conclusion IP markers were highly effective in generating comparative relationships between Arabidopsis and various Brassica species. Comparative genomics between the three Brassica lineages established the major rearrangements, translocations and fusions pivotal to karyotype diversification between the A, B and C genomes of Brassica species. The inter-relationships established between the Brassica lineages vis-à-vis Arabidopsis would facilitate the identification and isolation of candidate genes contributing to traits of agronomic value in crop Brassicas and the development of unified tools for Brassica genomics. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aims: Vegetation {{classification}} {{consistent with}} the Braun-Blanquet approach is widely used in Europe for applied vegetation science, conservation planning and landmanagement. During {{the long history of}} syntaxonomy,many concepts and names of vegetation units have been proposed, but there has been no single classification system integrating these units. Here we (1) present a comprehensive, hierarchical, syntaxonomic system of alliances, orders and classes of Braun-Blanquet syntaxonomy for vascular plant, bryophyte and lichen, and algal communities of Europe; (2) briefly characterize in ecological and geographic terms accepted syntaxonomic concepts; (3) link available synonyms to these accepted concepts; and (4) provide a list of diagnostic species for all classes. Location: European mainland, Greenland, Arctic archipelagos (including Iceland, Svalbard, Novaya Zemlya), Canary Islands,Madeira, Azores, Caucasus, Cyprus. Methods: We evaluated approximately 10 000 bibliographic sources to create a comprehensive list of previously proposed syntaxonomic units. These units were evaluated by experts for their floristic and ecological distinctness, clarity of geographic distribution and compliance with the <b>nomenclature</b> <b>code.</b> Accepted units were compiled into three systems of classes, orders and alliances (EuroVegChecklist, EVC) for communities dominated by vascular plants (EVC 1), bryophytes and lichens (EVC 2) and algae (EVC 3). Results: EVC 1 includes 109 classes, 300 orders and 1108 alliances; EVC 2 includes 27 classes, 53 orders and 137 alliances, and EVC 3 includes 13 classes, 24 orders and 53 alliances. In total 13 448 taxawere assigned as indicator species to classes of EVC 1, 2087 to classes of EVC 2 and 368 to classes of EVC 3. Accepted syntaxonomic concepts are summarized in a series of appendices, and detailed information on each is accessible through the software tool EuroVegBrowser. Conclusions: This paper features the first comprehensive and critical account of European syntaxa and synthesizes more than 100 yr of classification effort by European phytosociologists. It aims to document and stabilize the concepts and nomenclature of syntaxa for practical uses, such as calibration of habitat classification used by the European Union, standardization of terminology for environmental assessment, management and conservation of nature areas, landscape planning and education. The presented classification systems provide a baseline for future development and revision of European syntaxonomy...|$|E

This uniqueness and stability are, of course, a result of the acceptance by working systematists (biologists specializing in taxonomy), not merely of the binomial names themselves, but of the rules governing the use of these names, which are laid down in formal <b>nomenclature</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|R
