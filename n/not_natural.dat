5|$|The {{newly formed}} tricoordinated {{phosphite}} triester linkage is <b>not</b> <b>natural</b> and is of limited stability under {{the conditions of}} oligonucleotide synthesis. The treatment of the support-bound material with iodine and water {{in the presence of}} a weak base (pyridine, lutidine, or collidine) oxidizes the phosphite triester into a tetracoordinated phosphate triester, a protected precursor of the naturally occurring phosphate diester internucleosidic linkage. Oxidation may be carried out under anhydrous conditions using tert-Butyl hydroperoxide or, more efficiently, (1S)-(+)-(10-camphorsulfonyl)-oxaziridine (CSO). The step of oxidation is substituted with a sulfurization step to obtain oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (see Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates and their synthesis below). In the latter case, the sulfurization step is best carried out prior to capping.|$|E
5|$|To date, {{the most}} {{successful}} commercial application of lipid bilayers has been the use of liposomes for drug delivery, especially for cancer treatment. (Note- the term “liposome” is in essence synonymous with “vesicle” except that vesicle is a general term for the structure whereas liposome refers to only artificial <b>not</b> <b>natural</b> vesicles) The basic idea of liposomal drug delivery is that the drug is encapsulated in solution inside the liposome then injected into the patient. These drug-loaded liposomes travel through the system until they bind at the target site and rupture, releasing the drug. In theory, liposomes should make an ideal drug delivery system since they can isolate nearly any hydrophilic drug, can be grafted with molecules to target specific tissues and can be relatively non-toxic since the body possesses biochemical pathways for degrading lipids.|$|E

25|$|Man-made lakes, such as {{dams and}} flooded clay pits, gravel pits and {{quarries}}, often have low visibility. Disused and flooded quarries are popular in inland areas for diver training {{as well as}} recreational diving. Rock quarries may have reasonable underwater visibility - there is often little mud or silt to create mid-water particles that cause low visibility, {{and the lack of}} flow allows silt to settle on the bottom, where it may later be kicked up by unskilled divers to temporarily reduce visibility locally. As they are <b>not</b> <b>natural</b> environments, and usually privately owned, quarries may contain objects intentionally placed for divers to explore, such as sunken boats, automobiles, aircraft, or structures like grain silos and gravel chutes.|$|E

25|$|Anecdotal {{claims for}} an {{antimicrobial}} effect {{are based on}} abstract scientific experiments which show some antimicrobial activity in commercial grapefruit seed extracts and ethanol grapefruit seed extract but <b>not</b> <b>natural</b> GSE. The preliminary studies for the antimicrobial effect state that the Citricidal commercial brand of GSE was used for testing. There is considerable scientific evidence that the anti-microbial activity associated with grapefruit seed extract {{can be attributed to}} the contamination or adulteration of commercial GSE preparations with synthetic antimicrobials or preservatives. According to a 2001 study, branded commercial GSE preparations were contaminated with synthetic benzethonium chloride that was unlikely to have been made from grapefruit seeds. Some of the marketers claimed that their product did not contain benzethonium chloride and the error was due to the similarity in molecular weight of the quaternary ammonium compound which was formed through a proprietary manufacturing process. It is highly improbable that the preservative benzethonium chloride is formed during any extraction and/or processing of grapefruit seeds and pulp. Researchers conclusively demonstrated the presence of benzethonium chloride in commercial GSE using various analytical methods including HPLC, one- and two-dimensional NMR, PIXE analysis, and electrospray ionization MS. Another in vitro study claimed GSE had antibacterial properties. As with the branded in vitro test this extract was contaminated. The ethanolic grapefruit seed and pulp extract tested was prepared or contaminated with ethanol, a chemical solvent used in the extraction process. Ethanol, also known as ethyl alcohol, is effective in inhibiting bacteria.|$|E

500|$|Because it {{was known}} in ancient and medieval times that a solar eclipse could not take place during Passover (solar eclipses require a new moon while Passover only takes place during a full moon), it was {{considered}} a miraculous sign rather than a naturally occurring event.

Ernst Haeckel was particularly ardent, aiming to synthesise Darwin's ideas with those of Lamarck and Goethe while still reflecting the spirit of Naturphilosophie. Their ambitious programme to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life was joined by Huxley and supported by discoveries in [...] Haeckel used embryology extensively in his recapitulation theory, which embodied a progressive, almost linear model of evolution.
