50|$|Zephyr styling {{is roughly}} {{based on the}} old Kawasaki Z1, with twin shock rear suspension, a {{relatively}} upright riding position and air-cooled power units. The 400, 550 and 750 engines were developed from the old Z400/500/550/650/750/900 series. The 1100 engine {{is based upon the}} venerable air-cooled DOHC, eight-valve inline-four that traces its roots back through the GPz1100 to the Z1000. It is the only Zephyr built with two spark plugs per cylinder. The Zephyr offered the customer retro styling coupled with simplicity and reliability. Performance of the line was adequate for <b>normal</b> <b>riding</b> and the engines were tuned for low to mid range power.|$|R

5000|$|The {{difference}} between the fully extended length of the suspension and the length compressed {{by the weight of}} the motorcycle and rider is called [...] "total sag" [...] or [...] "race sag". Total sag is set to optimize the initial position of the suspension to avoid bottoming out or topping out under <b>normal</b> <b>riding</b> conditions. [...] "Bottoming out" [...] occurs when the suspension is compressed {{to the point where it}} mechanically cannot compress any more. Topping out occurs when the suspension extends fully and cannot mechanically extend any more. Increasing pre-load increases the initial force on the spring thereby reducing total sag. Decreasing pre-load decreases the initial force in the spring thereby increasing total sag.|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{just called}} the Kickflip and {{also known as}} the [...] "Classic Flip", this trick dates back to the 1970s and was invented by Curt Lindgren. You stand in the middle of your board with your feet side-by-side, pointed towards the nose. One foot - {{typically}} the back foot, although either is acceptable - is hooked {{around the edge of the}} board, and as the other foot pushes down, the hooked foot kicks sideways as the rider jumps upwards, turning his body to land back into a <b>normal</b> <b>riding</b> position. Many variations - such as Doubleflips, Varial Flips, 360 Flips and M-80s - have been invented over the years, and more continue to be invented today.|$|R

50|$|Rulers {{have been}} shown in {{specifically}} military dress since ancient times; the difference is especially easy to see in Ancient Roman sculpture, where generals and increasingly often emperors are depicted with armour and the short military tunic. Medieval tomb effigies {{more often than not}} depict knights, nobles and kings in armour, whether or not they saw active service. In the Early Modern period, when senior commanders tended to wear their <b>normal</b> <b>riding</b> dress even on the battlefield, the distinction between a military portrait and a normal one is mostly conveyed by the background, or by a breastplate or the buff leather jerkin worn underneath armour, but once even generals began to wear military uniform, in the mid-18th century, it becomes clear again, although initially officer's uniforms were close to smart civilian costume.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} general {{approach}} for simulating and controlling a hu-man character that is riding a bicycle. The two main components {{of our system}} are offline learning and online simulation. We sim-ulate the bicycle and the rider as an articulated rigid body system.

We apply policy search to learn the optimal policies, which are parameterized with splines or neural networks for dif-ferent bicycle maneuvers. We use Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topology (NEAT) to optimize both the parametrization and the pa-rameters of our policies. The learned controllers are robust enough to withstand large perturbations and allow interactive user control.

50|$|Of similar {{construction}} to a {{hydraulic shock absorber}} the strut used {{the motion of the}} suspension travelling over bumps to pump itself back up to a pre-set height. It was sufficiently powerful to regain up to 85% of <b>normal</b> <b>ride</b> height with a full load over the rear axle, and had the advantage of requiring no external power source or a dedicated hydraulic system in the vehicle. The same system was applied to the Land Rover in the 1980s when these vehicles adopted the Range Rover's coil spring suspension. In the 1990s Land Rover, in pursuit of the same blend of on- and off-road ability, developed an air suspension system that was both self-levelling and height adjustable. Originally this was in conjunction with live axles but it is now used with fully independent suspension using wishbones. The original coil-springs-with-hydraulic-strut system is still used on certain models of the current Land Rover Defender.|$|R
50|$|The {{current market}} of buses have {{suspension}} system consisting of either mechanical or air suspension system. Compared to its counterpart, air suspension system has significant benefits. Vehicle height {{can be maintained}} at a particular value irrespective of it load by varying the pressure and also standard coaches have a system called ferry lift. This allows the air suspension to be raised above the <b>normal</b> <b>ride</b> height level to originally aid loading and unloading the vehicle on and off ferries due to their steep ramps and risk of grounding out, but {{can be used on}} rough ground or on steep crests. Although the ferry lift may be installed on some buses, the Kneel Down facility is more common on public transport buses. This helps reduce the step height for easy ingress of passengers.The Kneel Down facility is also used when using the built in wheel chair ramps. Due to several advantages air suspension has been extensively used in commercial vehicles since 1980.|$|R
5000|$|Eventually, the {{out of work}} {{cowboys and}} out of season rodeo riders, and the {{directors}}/producers, figured out a system for the supply of extras. A speakeasy called The Watering Hole was located close to a Los Angeles located corral called the Sunset Corral. Every morning, the cowboys would congregate at The Watering Hole, where the directors would send over their assistants to hire for the following day. The cowboys would then dress in their <b>normal</b> <b>riding</b> clothes (unless told other wise, {{for which they were}} paid extra), and ride to the set, most of which were located to the north {{in the vicinity of the}} San Fernando Valley.

5000|$|Avalanche starts {{by passing}} through the storage room of the trains, then out of the {{building}} and onto the lift hill, so far the <b>ride</b> follows a <b>normal</b> <b>ride</b> track, {{at the top of the}} lift hill, the ride is released onto the main downhill track, which the ride is not physically held onto, it travels through various bobsled track style curves, picking up speed, before reaching the lowest curve and curving back up again, it then flattens out and travels into the first brake run, it then releases and the train travels around a bend and onto the second brake run, before being released again to travel into the station. The two brake runs are designed for when the roller coaster operates in full capacity, with all three trains running, so that the two trains returning to the station can wait on the brakes while the train in the station loads and unloads.|$|R

A dashboard-mounted override control was fitted to allow the rear suspension to be locked in <b>normal</b> <b>ride</b> height when parked, so the car did not drop in response to loading and unloading. It automatically released when the clutch was operated when driving off. A fan-belt driven high-pressure pump was added and an under-bonnet reservoir to hold the [...] "LHS" [...] hydraulic fluid.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} motorcycles in Australia {{is a significant}} concern as motorcycle riders represent 15 % of all road fatalities and an even greater proportion of serious injuries. This study assessed the psychosocial factors influencing motorcycle riders' intentions to perform both safe and risky riding behaviours. Using an extended theory of planned behaviour (TPB), motorcycle riders (n = 229) from Queensland, Australia were surveyed to assess their <b>riding</b> <b>attitudes,</b> subjective norm (general and specific), perceived behavioural control (PBC), group norm, self-identity, sensation seeking, and aggression, {{as well as their}} intentions, in relation to three safe (e. g., handle my motorcycle skilfully) and three risky (e. g., bend road rules to get through traffic) riding behaviours. Although there was variability in the predictors of intention across the behaviours, results revealed that safer rider intentions were most consistently predicted by PBC, while riskier intentions were predicted by attitudes and sensation seeking. The TPB was able to explain a greater proportion of the variance for intentions to perform risky behaviours. Overall, this study has provided insight into the complexity of factors contributing to rider intentions and suggests that different practical strategies need to be adopted to facilitate safer and reduce risky rider decisions.
