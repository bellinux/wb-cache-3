5000|$|Content in {{a complex}} network can spread via two major methods: conserved spread and non-conserved spread. [...] In conserved spread, {{the total amount of}} content that enters a complex network remains {{constant}} as it passes through. The model of conserved spread can best be represented by a pitcher containing a fixed amount of water being poured into a series of funnels connected by tubes [...] Here, the pitcher represents the original source and the water is the content being spread. The funnels and connecting tubing represent the nodes and the connections between nodes, respectively. As the water passes from one funnel into another, the water disappears instantly from the funnel that was previously exposed to the water. In non-conserved spread, the amount of content changes as it enters and passes through a complex network. The model of non-conserved spread can best be represented by a continuously running faucet running through a series of funnels connected by tubes. Here, the amount of water from the original source is infinite. Also, any funnels that have been exposed to the water continue to experience the water even as it passes into successive funnels.

5000|$|According to the {{so-called}} centroid hypothesis, judgments of distance between visual objects are strongly affected by the neural computation of centers-of-masses (centroids) of the luminance profiles of the objects (i.e., the position of centroid of an image determines its perceived location). As suggested by Morgan et al. , visual procedure of centroid extraction is causally related to a certain integration of neural activations (spatial pooling of the positional signals) evoked by the neighboring object parts. Though the integration reduces {{the ability of the}} visual system to determine accurately the mutual position of image elements (i.e., coarsens the positional acuity), such pooling seems to be quite biologically substantiated since it allows fast and reliable assessment of the location of the visual object as whole, irrespective of its size, the shape complexity, and illumination conditions. Concerning the Müller-Lyer and similar illusions, the pattern of <b>neural</b> <b>excitation</b> evoked by contextual flank (e.g., the Müller-Lyer wings themselves) overlaps with that caused by the stimulus terminator (e.g., the wings apex), thereby leading (due to the shift of the centroid of summed excitation) to its perceptual displacement (these positional changes are apparent in Dynamic Müller-Lyer Illusion by Gianni A. Sarcone, particularly with gaze fixation on any of the terminators). The crucial point in the centroid explanation regarding the positional shifts of the stimulus terminators in direction of the centers-of-masses of contextual flanks was confirmed in psychophysical examination of illusory figures with rotating distractors [...] The relative displacement of all stimulus terminators leads to misjudgment of distances between them; that is, the illusion occurs as a side effect due to necessarily low spatial resolution of the neural mechanism of assessment of the relative location of the visual objects. Unlike most other approaches, the centroid explanation is based on a relatively small set of assumptions and is capable of making quantitative predictions that can be immediately and purposefully tested in experiments {{with a wide variety of}} stimuli modifications. This quantitative approach offers not only some general trends, but also reveals a certain [...] "fine structure" [...] of the illusion magnitude changes , what is still unattainable for most of other widely accepted explanations of illusions of extent of the Müller-Lyer type.|$|E

40|$|In {{electrical}} hearing, multipulse integration (MPI) {{describes the}} rate at which detection threshold decreases with increasing stimulation rate in a fixed-duration pulse train. In human subjects, MPI {{has been shown to be}} dependent on the psychophysically estimated spread of <b>neural</b> <b>excitation</b> at a high stimulation rate, with broader spread predicting greater integration. The first aim of the present study was to replicate this finding using alternative methods for measuring MPI and spread of <b>neural</b> <b>excitation.</b> The second aim was to test the hypothesis that MPI is related to the slope of the psychometric function for detection. Specifically, a steep d’ versus stimulus level function would predict shallow MPI since the amount of current reduction necessary to compensate for an increase in stimulation rate to maintain threshold would be small. The MPI function was measured by obtaining adaptive detection thresholds at 160 and 640 pulses per second. Spread of <b>neural</b> <b>excitation</b> was measured by forward-masked psychophysical tuning curves. All psychophysical testing was performed in a monopolar stimulation mode (MP 1 [*]+[*] 2). Results showed that MPI was correlated with the slopes of the tuning curves, with broader tuning predicting steeper MPI, confirming the earlier finding. However, there was no relationship between MPI and the slopes of the psychometric functions. These results suggest that a broad stimulation of the cochlea facilitates MPI.

40|$|Motivated by {{the need}} to have an {{algorithm}} which (1) can solve generally constrained optimal control problems, (2) is globally convergent, (3) has a fast local convergence rate, a new algorithm, which solves fixed end-time optimal control problems with hard control constraints, end-point inequality constraints, and a variable initial state, is developed. This algorithm is based on a second-order approximation to the change of the cost functional due to a change in the control and a change in the initial state. Further approximation produces a simple convex functional. An exact penalty function is employed to penalize any violated end-point inequality constraints. We then show that the solution of the minimization of the convex functional, subject to linearized system dynamics, the original hard control constraints, the original hard initial state constraints, and linearized end-point constraints, generates a descent direction for that exact penalty function. We then show that the algorithm developed in this dissertation can also solve the following types of optimal control problems: (1) problems with a free end-time; (2) problems with path constraints; (3) problems with some design parameters that are also to be optimized. Global convergence properties of a version of the algorithm are analyzed. In particular, it is shown that the algorithm is globally convergent under some conditions. The local convergence rate of the algorithm can be better than that of the first-order algorithms when some matrices are properly updated. A version of the algorithm is implemented in a package which is easy to use. A variety of benchmark problems are solved. Finally, the algorithm is employed in solving two challenging biomechanics problems: (1) a human moving his arm from an initial resting position so as to touch an stop at a target with the tip of the index finger while the muscular stress, the joint constraint forces, and the <b>neural</b> <b>excitations</b> are minimized; (2) a human pedaling s stationary bicycle as fast as possible from rest.

Detection thresholds were measured in Cochlear Nucleus® device users using monopolar stimulation for pulse trains that were of (a) low rate and long duration, (b) high rate and short duration, and (c) high rate and long duration. Spatial selectivity of <b>neural</b> <b>excitation</b> was estimated by a forward-masking paradigm, where the probe threshold elevation {{in the presence of a}} forward masker was measured as a function of masker-probe separation. The strength of the correlation between the monopolar thresholds and the slopes of the masking patterns systematically reduced as neural response of the threshold stimulus involved interpulse interactions (refractoriness and sub-threshold adaptation), and spike-rate adaptation. Detection threshold for the low-rate stimulus most strongly correlated with the spread of forward masking patterns and the correlation reduced for long and high rate pulse trains. The low-rate thresholds were then measured for all electrodes across the array for each subject. Subsequently, speech recognition was tested with experimental maps that deactivated five stimulation sites with the highest thresholds and five randomly chosen ones. Performance with deactivating the high-threshold sites was better than performance with the subjects' clinical map used every day with all electrodes active, in both quiet and background noise. Performance with random deactivation was on average poorer than that with the clinical map but the difference was not significant. These results suggested that the monopolar low-rate thresholds are related to the spatial <b>neural</b> <b>excitation</b> patterns in cochlear implant users and can be used to select sites for more optimal speech recognition performance...|$|E

40|$|We {{sought to}} {{understand}} the basic neural processes involved in the functional linking of motor cortical points. We asked {{which of the two}} basic <b>neural</b> mechanisms, <b>excitation</b> or inhibition, is required to functionally link motor cortical points. In the ketamine-anaesthetized cat, a microstimulation electrode was positioned at a point (control point) that was identified by the following three characteristics of the EMG responses: the muscle(s) activated at threshold, any additional muscles recruited by supra-threshold stimulation, and their relative latency. A second distinct point (test point) producing activation of a muscle at a different joint was then identified. At this test cortical point the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline was ejected iontophoretically, while stimulating the control point near threshold. A combined response was elicited consisting of the response normally elicited at the control point plus that elicited at the test point. Thus, an artificial muscle synergy was produced following disinhibition of the test point. This was never the case when glutamate was ejected at the test point, even when supra-threshold stimuli were used at the control point. Therefore, simply increasing the excitability of a cortical point was not sufficient to release the muscle(s) represented at that point into a muscle synergy. Kynurenate, a broadly acting excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist, ejected at the bicuculline point reversed the effect of bicuculline. This shows that the release phenomenon was mediated synaptically and was not due to spread of the stimulating current. We suggest that release from inhibition {{may be one of the}} neural mechanisms involved in functionally linking motor cortical points. This functional linking may be part of the ensemble of motor cortical mechanisms involved in recruitment of muscle synergies...|$|R
40|$|The {{environment}} moderates behaviour using {{a subtle}} language of ‘affordances’ and ‘behaviour-settings’. Affordances are environmental offerings. They are objects that demand action; a cliff demands a leap and binoculars demand a peek. Behaviour-settings are ‘places;’ spaces encoded with expectations and meanings. Behaviour-settings work {{the opposite way}} to affordances; they demand inhibition; an introspective demeanour in a church or when under surveillance. Most affordances and behaviour-settings are designed, and as such, designers are effectively predicting brain reactions. • Affordances are nested within, and moderated by behaviour-settings. Both trigger automatic <b>neural</b> responses (<b>excitation</b> and inhibition). These, for the best part cancel each other out. This balancing enables object recognition and allows choice about what action should be taken (if any). But when excitation exceeds inhibition, instinctive action will automatically commence. In positive circumstances this may mean laughter or a smile. In negative circumstances, fleeing, screaming or other panic responses are likely. People with poor frontal function, due to immaturity (childhood or developmental disorders) or due to hypofrontality (schizophrenia, brain damage or dementia) have a reduced capacity to balance excitatory and inhibitory impulses. For these people, environmental behavioural demands increase with the decline of frontal brain function. • The world around us is not only encoded with symbols and sensory information. Opportunities and restrictions work on a much more primal level. Person/space interactions constantly take place at a molecular scale. Every space we enter has its own special dynamic, where individualism vies for supremacy between the opposing forces of affordance-related excitation and the inhibition intrinsic to behaviour-settings. And in this context, even a small change–the installation of a CCTV camera can turn a circus to a prison. • This paper draws on cutting-edge neurological theory to understand the psychological determinates of the everyday experience of the designed environment...|$|R

The model was developed in three phases. Firstly, the Hodgkin-Huxley model was modified to describe action potential dynamics at Ranvier nodes using recorded ionic membrane current data from single human myelinated peripheral nerve fibres. A nerve fibre cable model, based on a combination of two existing models, was subsequently developed using human sensory nerve fibre morphometric data. Lastly the morphological parameters of the nerve fibre model were changed to resemble a Type I peripheral auditory nerve fibre and coupled to a volume-conduction model of the cochlea. This study is the first to show that the Hodgkin-Huxley model equations can be modified successfully to predict excitation behaviour of a generalised human peripheral sensory nerve fibre without using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equations. The model includes a more comprehensive establishment of temperature dependence of the physiological and electrical parameters compared to existing models. Two versions of the human Type I auditory nerve fibre model were developed, one simulating an undamaged (non-degenerate) fibre and another a damaged (degenerate) fibre. Comparison between predicted and measured results indicated similar transient and persistent sodium, as well as slow potassium ionic membrane currents to those found in generalised sensory nerve fibres. Results confirm that chronaxie, rheobase current, mean latency, threshold and relative refractive periods depend on the amount of degeneracy of fibres. The model could account for threshold differences observed between different asymmetric waveforms. The combination of persistent sodium and slow potassium ionic membrane currents could in part predict non-monotonic excitation behaviour observed experimentally.

We find that the sparsity of long-range inhibition in V 1 plays a previously unrecognized but key functional role in preserving the normal vision state. Surprisingly, it also contributes to the observed regularity of geometric visual hallucinations. Our results provide an explanation for the observed sparsity of long-range inhibition in V 1 —this generic architectural feature is an evolutionary adaptation that tunes V 1 to the normal vision state.

40|$|Autonomic {{nervous system}} (ANS) {{dysfunction}} {{is evidenced by}} reduced baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), which can be quantified as the slope between SBP and RR values in baroreflex events (BEs). BEs can be either of short or of long length, so {{they are likely to}} be associated with fast/parasympathetic as well as with slow/sympathetic ANS modulations. Under sympathetic inhibition, LF power in Muscle Sympathetic Nerve Activity (MSNA) decreases and HF power dominates. Therefore, it is suggested that LF and HF powers of MSNA are related with sympathetic <b>neural</b> <b>excitation</b> and inhibition, respectively. In this work, MSNA powers are associated with BRS from short/long BEs, defined from a cutoff length estimated from the respiratory frequency of each subject. The results indicate that BRS from short(long) BEs are correlated with HF(LF), while not significantly correlated with LF(HF) powers. Therefore, short and long BEs may carry differentinformation on ANS modulations in baroreflex regulation. SCOPUS: cp. pinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} {{in recent years that}} pulsed, infrared laser light can be used to elicit electrical responses in neural tissue, independent of any further modification of the target tissue. Infrared neural stimulation has been reported in a variety of peripheral and sensory neural tissue in vivo, with particular interest shown in stimulation of neurons in the auditory nerve. However, while INS has been shown to work in these settings, the mechanism (or mechanisms) by which infrared light causes <b>neural</b> <b>excitation</b> is currently not well understood. The protocol presented here describes a whole cell patch clamp method designed to facilitate the investigation of infrared neural stimulation in cultured primary auditory neurons. By thoroughly characterizing the response of these cells to infrared laser illumination in vitro under controlled conditions, {{it may be possible to}} gain an improved understanding of the fundamental physical and biochemical processes underlying infrared neural stimulation...|$|E
