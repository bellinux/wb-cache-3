50|$|This {{character}} is sometimes {{used to create}} visual spacing within a sequence of characters, where a whitespace {{character is}} not permitted (e.g., in computer filenames, email addresses, and in Internet URLs). Some computer applications will automatically underline text surrounded by underscores: _underlined_ will render <b>underlined.</b> It <b>is</b> often used in plain text-only media (IRC, instant messaging, classical Email) for this purpose. When the underscore is used for emphasis in this fashion, it is usually interpreted as indicating that the enclosed <b>text</b> <b>is</b> <b>underlined</b> (as opposed to being italicized or bold, which is indicated by /slashes/ or *asterisks*, respectively).|$|R
50|$|The reader demands {{compliance}} with the established generic conventions {{so that he can}} integrate the <b>new</b> <b>text,</b> {{but at the same time}} he expects the writer to manipulate these established conventions so that the <b>new</b> <b>text</b> <b>is</b> more than a tedious repetition of the generic tradition.|$|R

50|$|To make editing long pages easier, MediaWiki {{allows the}} editing of a {{subsection}} of a page (as identified by its header). A user can also indicate {{whether or not}} an edit is minor.

50|$|In 1993, {{with the}} {{publication}} of the expanded Text Encoding Initiative or TEI guidelines, the WWP began a three-year period of research on how to use the new guidelines to represent early women’s texts.

50|$|In secular {{academic}} use, however, New Latin declined {{sharply and}} then continuously after about 1700.

50|$|In December 2000, Putin sanctioned the law {{to change}} the National anthem of Russia. At the time the Anthem had music by Glinka and no words.

50|$|A {{drawback}} to computing vectors in this way, when adding new searchable documents, is that terms {{that were not}} known during the SVD phase for the original index are ignored. These terms will have {{no impact on the}} global weights and learned correlations derived from the original collection of text. However, the computed vectors for the <b>new</b> <b>text</b> <b>are</b> still very relevant for similarity comparisons with all other document vectors.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method to}} use a chunker for grammar checking. Once a chunker is available the method is fully unsuper-vised, only unannotated <b>text</b> <b>is</b> required for training. The method is very simple, compare {{the output of the}} chunker on <b>new</b> <b>texts</b> to the output on known cor-rect text. Rare chunk sequences that oc-cur in the <b>new</b> <b>texts</b> <b>are</b> reported as sus-pected errors. By automatically modify-ing the chunk set to be more detailed for common verbs or prepositions more er-ror types can be detected. The method is evaluated on Swedish texts from a few different genres. Our method can be used without modifications on any lan-guage, as long as a chunker is available for that language. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{problem can}} occur when working on heavily edited {{articles}} on Wikipedia, {{such as those}} about a current event or a person suddenly in the news, {{as well as other}} high-traffic pages. If a significant amount of <b>new</b> <b>text</b> <b>is</b> involved, the editor who receives an [...] "edit conflict" [...] error message can cut and paste the <b>new</b> <b>text</b> into a word processor or similar program for further editing, or can paste that text directly into a newer version of the target document. Simple copyediting can be done directly on the newer version, and then saved.|$|R
500|$|In February 1901, the {{translation}} of the New Testament from Koine into Modern Greek that she had sponsored was published without the authorization of the Greek Holy Synod.

The project included the creation of introductory materials for 100 texts, currently constituting a sub-collection of Women Writers Online. In 1999 Women Writers Online was published, making the corpus available online.|$|R

30|$|Briefly, the {{intervention}} involved jointly reading descriptive reports in detail, making {{notes on the}} board from these <b>texts,</b> and writing <b>new</b> <b>texts</b> on the board from the notes. In the R 2 L methodology, these activities are known as Detailed Reading, Note-making, and Joint Construction (Rose & Martin, 2012). This sequence {{was repeated three times}} with each class. In the first two iterations, an L 1 (Indonesian) <b>text</b> <b>was</b> read, notes were made in L 1 and translated into L 2 (English), and an L 2 <b>text</b> <b>was</b> written from the notes. In the third iteration, an L 2 <b>text</b> <b>was</b> read, and notes and a <b>new</b> <b>text</b> <b>were</b> written in L 2.
