5|$|Prevention mostly {{involves}} eliminating kissing {{bugs and}} avoiding their bites. Other preventative efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. A vaccine {{has not been}} developed as of 2017. Early infections are treatable with the medication benznidazole or <b>nifurtimox.</b> Medication nearly always results in a cure if given early, but becomes less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of end–stage symptoms. Benznidazole and <b>nifurtimox</b> cause temporary side effects in up to 40% of people including skin disorders, brain toxicity, and digestive system irritation.|$|E
5|$|Antiparasitic {{treatment}} {{is most effective}} early {{in the course of}} infection, but is not limited to cases in the acute phase. Drugs of choice include azole or nitro derivatives, such as benznidazole or <b>nifurtimox.</b> Both agents are limited in their capacity to completely eliminate T. cruzi from the body (parasitologic cure), especially in chronically infected patients, and resistance to these drugs has been reported.|$|E
25|$|For T. b. gambiense the {{combination}} of <b>nifurtimox</b> and eflornithine (NECT) or eflornithine alone {{appear to be more}} effective and result in fewer side effects. These treatments may replace melarsoprol when available with {{the combination}} being first line. NECT has the benefit of requiring less injections of eflornithine.|$|E
25|$|The organoarsenical {{melarsoprol}} (Arsobal) {{developed in}} the 1940s is effective for patients with second-stage sleeping sickness. However, 3–10% of those injected have reactive encephalopathy (convulsions, progressive coma, or psychotic reactions), and 10–70% of such cases result in death; it can cause brain damage in those who survive the encephalopathy. However, due to its effectiveness, melarsoprol is still used today. Resistance to melarsoprol is increasing, and combination therapy with <b>nifurtimox</b> is currently under research.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{of severe}} disease {{involves}} screening {{the population at}} risk with blood tests for TbG. Treatment is easier when the disease is detected early and before neurological symptoms occur. Treatment of the first stage is with the medications pentamidine or suramin. Treatment of the second stage involves eflornithine {{or a combination of}} <b>nifurtimox</b> and eflornithine for TbG. While melarsoprol works for both stages, it is typically only used for TbR, due to serious side effects. Without treatment it typically results in death.|$|E
50|$|Use of <b>nifurtimox</b> {{should be}} avoided in {{pregnant}} women due to limited use. There is limited data shown that <b>nifurtimox</b> doses up to 15 mg/kg daily can cause adverse effects in breastfed infants. Other authors do not consider breastfeeding a contraindication during <b>nifurtimox</b> use.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nifurtimox</b> {{has also}} been used to treat African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), and is active in {{the second stage of}} the disease (central nervous system involvement). When <b>nifurtimox</b> is given on its own, about half of all {{patients}} will relapse, but the combination of melarsoprol with <b>nifurtimox</b> appears to be efficacious. Trials are awaited comparing melarsoprol/nifurtimox against melarsoprol alone for African sleeping sickness.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nifurtimox</b> {{has been}} used to treat Chagas disease, when it is given for 30 to 60 days. However, long term use of <b>Nifurtimox</b> does {{increase}} chances of adverse events like gastrointestinal and neurological side effects. Due to the low tolerance and completion rate of <b>Nifurtimox,</b> benznidazole is now being more considered for those who have Chagas disease and require long term treatment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nifurtimox</b> is sold as Lampit by Bayer. It was {{previously}} known as Bayer 2502.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nifurtimox</b> is in a phase-II {{clinical}} {{trial for the}} treatment of pediatric neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma.|$|E
50|$|Sleeping sickness, or trypanosomiasis, {{is treated}} with {{pentamidine}} or suramin (depending on subspecies of parasite) delivered by intramuscular injection {{in the first}} phase of the disease, and with melarsoprol and eflornithine intravenous injection in the second phase of the disease. Efornithine is commonly given in combination with <b>nifurtimox,</b> which reduces the treatment time to 7 days of eflornithine infusions plus 10 days of oral <b>nifurtimox</b> tablets.|$|E
50|$|Acute {{cases are}} treated with <b>nifurtimox</b> and benznidazole, but no {{effective}} therapy for chronic cases is currently known.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nifurtimox</b> forms a nitro-anion radical {{metabolite}} that {{reacts with}} nucleic acids of the parasite causing significant break down of DNA. Its mechanism {{is similar to}} that proposed for the antibacterial action of nitrofuran agents. <b>Nifurtimox</b> undergoes reduction and creates oxygen radicals such as superoxide. These radicals are toxic to T. cruzi. Mammalian cells are protected by presence of catalase, glutathione, peroxidases, and superoxide dismutase. Accumulation of hydrogen peroxide to cytotoxic levels results in parasite death.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nifurtimox</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} with severe liver or kidney disease, {{as well as people}} with a background of neurological or psychiatric disorders.|$|E
50|$|Primaquine {{has been}} studied in animal models of Chagas disease and was about four times as {{effective}} as the standard of care, <b>nifurtimox.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Nifurtimox</b> {{came into}} {{medication}} use in 1965. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. It is not available commercially in Canada or the United States. In the United States the medication can be gotten from the Center for Disease Control. It cost about 20 USD for a course of treatment as of 2013. In regions of the world where the disease is common <b>nifurtimox</b> is provided for free by the World Health Organization.|$|E

50|$|Combination {{therapy with}} {{eflornithine}} and <b>nifurtimox</b> is safer and easier than treatment with eflornithine alone, {{and appears to}} be equally or more effective. It has been recommended as first-line treatment for second-stage African trypanosomiasis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nifurtimox</b> is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} Chagas disease and sleeping sickness. For sleeping sickness it is used together with eflornithine. In Chagas disease it is a second line option to benznidazole. It is given by mouth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nifurtimox</b> is only {{licensed}} {{for use in}} Argentina and Germany, {{where it}} is sold as 120-mg tablets.

50|$|Trypanosomes are {{parasitic}} protozoa {{that cause}} African trypanosomiasis and Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis). There are no vaccines {{to prevent these}} infections so drugs such as pentamidine and suramin, benznidazole and <b>nifurtimox</b> and used to treat infections. These drugs are effective but infections caused by resistant parasites have been reported.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include {{abdominal}} pain, headache, nausea, and weight loss.

It is a type of nitrofuran.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis {{is often}} missed {{in the first}} phase of the disease due to {{non-specific}} nature of symptoms. Pentamidine and Suramin are used for treatment {{in the first phase}}. Melarsoprol, <b>nifurtimox</b> and eflornithine are drugs used in second phase of the disease. However none of the therapies available are optimal in terms of adverse events and ease of administration.|$|E
50|$|Eflornithine, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Vaniqa among others, is a {{medication}} used to treat African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) and excessive hair growth on the face in women.

50|$|Eflornithine is also {{effective}} {{in combination with}} other drugs, such as melarsoprol and <b>nifurtimox.</b> A study in 2005 compared the safety of eflornithine alone to melarsoprol and found eflornithine to be more effective and safe in treating second-stage sleeping sickness Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. Eflornithine is not {{effective in}} the treatment of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense due to the parasite's low sensitivity to the drug. Instead, melarsoprol is used to treat Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. Another randomized control trial in Uganda compared the efficacy of various combinations of these drugs and found that the nifurtimox-eflornithine combination was the most promising first-line theory regimen.|$|E
50|$|NECT, a {{combination}} therapy of <b>nifurtimox</b> and eflornithine, {{is the first}} new, improved treatment option in 25 years for stage 2 (advanced stage) human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) also known as sleeping sickness. It {{is the result of}} a six-year partnership between NGOs, governments, pharmaceutical companies, and the WHO. It was launched in 2009 and included in the WHO Essential Medicines List and WHO Essential Medicines List for Children in 2009 and 2013 respectively. It requires shorter hospitalization than previous treatment, and is much safer than previously widely used arsenic-based Melarsoprol that killed about 5% of patients. NECT is now used to treat 100% of the patients infected with HAT stage 2 in all 13 endemic countries.|$|E
50|$|Currently, no {{therapeutic}} {{drugs are}} prescribed for the disease. Therefore, prevention {{is the sole}} mode of treatment. This disease can only be prevented by quarantining sick birds and preventing migration of birds around the house, causing them to spread the disease. Deworming of birds with anthelmintics can reduce exposure to the cecal nematodes that carry the protozoan. Good management of the farm, including immediate quarantine of infected birds and sanitation, is the main useful strategy for controlling {{the spread of the}} parasitic contamination. The only drug used for the control (prophylaxis) in the United States is nitarsone at 0.01875% of feed until 5 days before marketing. Natustat and nitarsone were shown to be effective therapeutic drugs. <b>Nifurtimox,</b> a compound with known antiprotozoal activity, was demonstrated to be significantly effective at 300-400 ppm, and well tolerated by turkeys.|$|E
40|$|Introduction Women with Chagas disease {{receiving}} {{treatment with}} <b>nifurtimox</b> are discouraged from breast feeding. Many patients who would receive treatment with <b>nifurtimox</b> live in extreme poverty, have {{limited access to}} resources such as clean water and baby formula and may not have safe alternatives to breast milk. Aim We aimed to estimate, using limited available pharmacokinetics data, potential infant exposure to <b>nifurtimox</b> through breast milk. Methods Original <b>nifurtimox</b> plasma concentrations were obtained from published studies. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using non-linear mixed-effect modelling with NONMEM V. VI. A total of 1000 <b>nifurtimox</b> plasma-concentration profiles were simulated and {{used to calculate the}} amount of drug that an infant would be exposed to, if breast fed 150 ml/kg/day. Results Breast milk concentrations on the basis of peak plasma levels (1361 ng/ml) and milk-plasma ratio were estimated. We calculated infant <b>nifurtimox</b> exposure of a breastfed infant of a mother treated with this drug to be below 10 % of the maternal weight-adjusted dose, even if milk-plasma ratio were overestimated. Simulation led to similar estimates. Discussion Risk for significant infant exposure to <b>nifurtimox</b> through breast milk seems small and below the level of exposure of infants with Chagas disease receiving <b>nifurtimox</b> treatment. This potential degree of exposure may not justify discontinuation of breast feeding...|$|E
40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{improving}} the available drugs {{for the treatment of}} Chagas disease, individual enantiomers of <b>nifurtimox</b> were characterized. The results indicate that the enantiomers are equivalent in their in vitro activity against a panel of Trypanosoma cruzi strains; in vivo efficacy in a murine model of Chagas disease; in vitro toxicity and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion characteristics; and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties. There is unlikely to be any therapeutic benefit of an indi-vidual <b>nifurtimox</b> enantiomer over the racemic mixture. <b>Nifurtimox</b> is one of only two drugs currently registered for thetreatment of Chagas disease caused by the parasite Trypano-soma cruzi. While <b>nifurtimox</b> is effective when treatment is initi-ated during the acute stage of infection, its effectiveness in treating the chronic stage of infection is highly variable (1). Treatment with <b>nifurtimox</b> is associated with a high incidence of severe side effects, and as a result, the related nitroheterocycle benznidazole is currently the drug of choice for the treatment of Chagas disease. In vivo, different strains of T. cruzi have been reported to exhibit differing susceptibilities to <b>nifurtimox,</b> which may contribute to variations in its effectiveness (2, 3) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} nifurtimox-eflornithine {{combination}} therapy (NECT) {{for the treatment}} of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) has renewed interest in the potential of nitro drugs as chemotherapeutics. In order to study the implications of the more widespread use of nitro drugs against these parasites, we examined the in vivo and in vitro resistance potentials of <b>nifurtimox</b> and fexinidazole and its metabolites. Following selection in vitro by exposure to increasing concentrations of <b>nifurtimox,</b> Trypanosoma brucei brucei nifurtimox-resistant clones designated NfxR 1 and NfxR 2 were generated. Both cell lines were found to be 8 -fold less sensitive to <b>nifurtimox</b> than parental cells and demonstrated cross-resistance to a number of other nitro drugs, most notably the clinical trial candidate fexinidazole (∼ 27 -fold more resistant than parental cells). Studies of mice confirmed that the generation of <b>nifurtimox</b> resistance in these parasites did not compromise virulence, and NfxR 1 remained resistant to both <b>nifurtimox</b> and fexinidazole in vivo. In the case of fexinidazole, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies indicate that the parent drug is rapidly metabolized to the sulfoxide and sulfone form of this compound. These metabolites retained trypanocidal activity but were less effective in nifurtimox-resistant lines. Significantly, trypanosomes selected for resistance to fexinidazole were 10 -fold more resistant to <b>nifurtimox</b> than parental cells. This reciprocal cross-resistance has important implications for the therapeutic use of <b>nifurtimox</b> in a clinical setting and highlights a potential danger in the use of fexinidazole as a monotherapy...|$|E
