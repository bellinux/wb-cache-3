25|$|The Taisho School, Brazil’s first Japanese {{language}} school, {{opened in}} 1915 in São Paulo.

Japanese newspaper <b>Nikkei</b> claims that PSA will sell the electric city car Mitsubishi i MiEV in Europe by 2011.|$|E
25|$|With so {{much money}} readily {{available}} for investment, speculation was inevitable, particularly in the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the real estate market. The <b>Nikkei</b> stock index hit its all-time high on 29 December 1989 when it reached an intra-day high of 38,957.44 before closing at 38,915.87. The rates for housing, stocks, and bonds rose so much {{that at one point}} the government issued 100-year bonds. Additionally, banks granted increasingly risky loans.|$|E

25|$|The {{nomenclature}} {{for each}} of their generations who are citizens or long-term residents of countries other than Japan, used by Japanese Americans and other nationals of Japanese descent are explained here; they are formed by combining one of the Japanese numbers corresponding to the generation with the Japanese word for generation (sei 世). The Japanese American communities have themselves distinguished their members with terms like Issei, Nisei, and Sansei, which describe the first, second, and third generations of immigrants. The fourth generation is called Yonsei (四世), and the fifth is called Gosei (五世). The term <b>Nikkei</b> (日系) encompasses Japanese immigrants in all countries and of all generations.|$|E
25|$|Chongryon {{opposes the}} use of the Japanese word Kita-Chosen ("North Korea") as an {{abbreviation}} of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It refers to the country as Kyōwakoku ("The Republic") or Sokoku ("The Fatherland"). In 1972 Chongryon campaigned to get the Japanese media to stop referring to North Korea as Kita-Chosen. This effort was not successful, but as a compromise, most media companies agreed to refer to the DPRK with its full official title at least once in every article. By January 2003, this policy started to be abandoned by most newspapers, starting with Tokyo Shimbun, which announced that it would no longer write out the full name, followed by Asahi, Mainichi and <b>Nikkei.</b>|$|E
25|$|Victoire Pisa {{opened his}} racing career with three races at Kyoto Racecourse in late 2009.

Two weeks later he recorded his first win in a ten furlong maiden race. On 28 November Victoire Pisa started the 1/2 favourite for the Kyoto Two-year-old Stakes and won by one and a half lengths. On his final start of the year he was moved up in class for the domestic Group Three Radio <b>Nikkei</b> Hai Nisai Stakes at Hanshin Racecourse on 26 December. Starting the 3/5 favourite he took the lead near the finish and won by a neck from Cosmo Phantom.|$|E
25|$|On 14 February 2009, Strauss-Kahn stated 'This {{commitment}} is the single-largest supplemental financing contribution by an IMF member country ever, and it clearly demonstrates Japan's leadership and continuing {{commitment to a}} multilateral approach to global economic and financial challenges.' Strauss-Kahn said he hoped other countries would join Japan in providing support to the 185-nation institution. Prime Minister Taro Aso told Japan was ready to lend up to $100 billion from our foreign reserves to the IMF if it finds itself with insufficient funds to help emergency economies. <b>Nikkei</b> Business Daily reported that selling U.S. government bonds held by Japan to provide cash to the IMF would affect U.S. bond yields so Tokyo may consider lending U.S. government bonds to the IMF as collateral for it to raise funds.|$|E
25|$|Particularly early on, free-to-play games {{caught on}} fastest in South Korea and Russia, where they took over 90% of the gaming market. There are free-to-play, pay-to-connect games {{where there is}} no charge for playing, but often the free servers are congested. Access to uncongested servers is {{reserved}} for fee-paying members. Free-to-play games are particularly prevalent in countries such as South Korea and the People's Republic of China. Microtransaction-based free-to-play mobile games and browser games such as Puzzle & Dragons, Kantai Collection and The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls also have large player populations in Japan. In particular, the <b>Nikkei</b> Shimbun reported that Cinderella Girls earns over 1 billion yen in revenue monthly from microtransactions. Electronic Arts first adopted the free-to-play concept in one of its games when it released FIFA Online in Korea.|$|E
25|$|Reactor units 3, 4, and 7 all {{automatically}} powered down {{safely in}} response to the quake. Unit 2 was in startup mode and not online. Units 1, 5, and 6 were already shut down for inspection at the time. TEPCO was ready to restart some of the units as of the next day, but the trade ministry ordered the plant to remain idle until additional safety checks could be completed. On Wednesday, July 18, the mayor of Kashiwazaki ordered operations at the plant to be halted until its safety could be confirmed. The <b>Nikkei</b> reported that government safety checks could delay the restart for over a year, without stating the source of the information. For comparison, in 2005, a reactor at the Onagawa NPP was closed for five months following an earthquake.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, the Japanese economy shifted its {{emphasis}} from {{primary and secondary}} activities (notably agriculture, manufacturing, and mining) to processing, with telecommunications and computers becoming increasingly vital. Information became an important resource and product, central to wealth and power. The rise of an information-based economy was led by major research in highly sophisticated technology, such as advanced computers. The selling and use of information became very beneficial to the economy. Tokyo became a major financial center, {{home to some of}} the world's major banks, financial firms, insurance companies, and the world's largest stock exchange, the Tokyo Securities and Stock Exchange. Even here, however, the recession took its toll. In 1992, the <b>Nikkei</b> 225 stock average began the year at 23,000 points, but fell to 14,000 points in mid-August before leveling off at 17,000 {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
