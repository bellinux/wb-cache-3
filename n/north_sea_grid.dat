40|$|Purpose: This study aims to {{contribute}} to an improved understanding of the environmental implications of offshore power grid and wind power development pathways. To achieve this aim, we present two assessments. First, we investigate the impacts of a North Sea power grid enabling enhanced trade and integration of offshore wind power. Second, we assess {{the benefit of the}} <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>grid</b> and wind power through a comparison of scenarios for power generation in affected countries. Methods: The grid scenario explored in the first assessment is the most ambitious scenario of the Windspeed project, and is the result of cost minimization analysis using a transmission expansion planning model. We develop a hybrid life cycle inventory for array cables, HVDC links and substations. The functional unit is 1 kWh of electricity transmitted. The second assessment compares two different energy scenarios of Windspeed for the North Sea and surrounding countries. Here we utilize life cycle inventory for offshore grid components together with inventory for a catalog of power generation technologies from Ecoinvent, and couple these inventories with grid configurations and electricity mixes determined by the optimization procedure in Windspeed. Results and discussion: Developing, operating and dismantling the grid cause emissions of 2. 5 g CO 2 -Eq per kWh electricity transmission, or 36 Mt CO 2 -Eq in total. HVDC cables are the major cause of environmental damage, causing for example half of total climate change effects. The next most important contributors are substations and array cabling used in offshore wind parks. Toxicity and eutrophication effects stem largely from leakages from disposed copper and iron mine tailings and overburden. Results from the comparison of two scenarios demonstrate a substantial environmental benefit from <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>grid</b> extension and the associated wind power development compared to an alternative generation of electricity from fossil fuels. Offshore grid and wind power, however, entail an increased use of metals and hence a higher metal depletion indicator. Conclusions: We present the first life cycle assessment of a large offshore power grid, using results of an energy planning model as input. HVDC links are the major cause of environmental damage. There are differences across impact categories with respect to which components or types of activities that are responsible for damage. <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>grid</b> and wind power are environmentally beneficial by an array of criteria if displacing fossil fuels, but cause substantial metal use.    </p...|$|E

40|$|Political, {{regulatory}} and societal drivers and barriers for {{the realization of}} a meshed offshore grid between North Sea countries is here assessed. The Norwegian context {{is the point of}} departure, but with clear references to relevant processes at the European level. At the EU level there is an overall drive towards establishing common infrastructure for electricity distribution across borders, but no concrete measures concerning a meshed grid. At the Norwegian level, there is currently no clear commitment towards a <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Grid</b> development. Norwegian authorities' approach to off-shore infrastructure, and related processes in the EU and NSCOGI, has thus far been characterized by a wait-and-see attitude. The Norwegian approach is characterized by socio-economic perspectives, with limited attention towards possible long-term and cross-sectoral effects; such as innovation, and new industrial possibilities. Off-shore wind power development could constitute a 'proxy', and licensing procedures for such installations have been in place for some years, but without any economic incentives. Furthermore, interconnector projects between Norway, the UK and Germany could be considered as potential steppingstones towards a meshed grid. However, harmonization between different national licensing systems stands out as challenging, and there is limited experience of coordinating the licensing of crossborder projects. Closely related to this is the question of public acceptance, including the possible need for on-shore grid upgrading which can trigger local resistance...|$|E

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis has been to gain an {{understanding}} on the key challenges for self-organization between the relevant stakeholders necessary for rolling out a <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> Offshore <b>Grid.</b> The <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> Offshore <b>Grid</b> (NSOG) {{is an important component}} in the realization of the renewable energy potential in different European countries. Up till now no commonly accepted strategy has been composed for rolling out this offshore grid in a coordinated way. This lack of a commonly accepted strategy is affecting the trust and progress in international collaboration and in the coordinate development of national visions. This lack of coordination increases the risk for lock-in effects leading to sub-optimal development pathways. The current research and practices on the valuation of optimal grid configuration has been based on the comparison of costs and benefits of the different policy options. This research has taken a different approach, and has looked at the different stakeholder perspectives on developments in the offshore wind industry. Results show multiple challenges currently blocking a coordinated NSOG rollout. One of the major challenges is the discrepancy and the lack of common ground between stakeholders on the monetization, composition and distribution of these costs and benefits. These disagreements on costs and benefits {{are not likely to be}} resolved by yet another improved effort at classic cost-benefit analysis. Also, the identification of costs and benefits for individual projects lacks the synergy effects of a total grid. Other important challenges identified are the lack of profitability and high risk level of making (anticipatory) investments necessary to facilitate a future grid expansion and the lack of trust between the different stakeholder on future commitment and collaboration. The combination of these challenges has resulted in an equilibrium of stakeholders defecting and performing free-riders behavior, waiting for others to take the risk and invest in sufficient offshore wind capacity necessary for allowing for profitable business case to be set up. It has thus been argued that focus of the current discussions should shift from identifying the most efficient project or grid configuration, towards a discussion about ways how to increasing the willingness of Member States to express their long-term financial commitment towards the development of the grid and accept the investment risks by putting the costs and benefits of the NSOG in a broader perspective of potential gains for the individual Member States. This research has used the SES-framework and the self-organization theory from Ostrom as tools for structuring and reflecting on the results. However, both the framework as the theory have been initially developed for ecological systems. Since the <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> Offshore <b>Grid</b> is a Social Technical System (STS), a second line of research which has been presented in this report is related to the applicability of both the framework and the theory on comparable STS.

We find that in terms of overall welfare, the meshed solution is superior; however, from a distributional perspective there are losers of such a scheme, e. g. the incumbent electricity generators in France, Germany, and Poland, and the consumers in low-price countries, e. g. Norway and Sweden. Merchant transmission financing, based on congestion rents only, does not seem to be a sustainable option to provide sufficient network capacities, and much of the investment will have to be regulated to come about.

A stochastic two-stage mixed-integer linear program is used for this purpose applied to a case study of the <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> Offshore <b>Grid</b> (NSOG).

Some of them are generation scheduling, load-frequency control, reactive power-voltage control and power system stability. In this thesis, {{the stability of the}} future <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> electric <b>grid</b> in the presence of large off-shore wind farms will be studied. A test system is modeled using the simulation tool PSS/E. The first step is to estimate the configuration and parameters of the offshore wind network connected to land. Results from the static and dynamic simulations of the model are analyzed to discuss how the power balance and system reliability with the increased wind power penetration can be maintained. The new technology based in transistors HVDC Light is taken in consideration for connecting islanded systems to AC grid systems when connection points are far away. It is found that a scenario with more than 6 % of offshore wind power supply does not serve grid connection requirements in UK.

Its development is a priority for the European climate and energy policy, {{which has led to}} a number of studies on the subject.

This review develops a simple and effective methodology that can be applied to other reviews of energy systems models. It jointly considers the studies of interest, the system characteristics, a categorization framework and relevant indicators. The analysis indicates most studies focus on investment and operation of the grid using optimization models, with rare use of other research questions or other model approaches. Moreover, results vary significantly, and their comparability is limited due to differences in assumptions, methodology and detail of results publication. Nonetheless, integrated typologies frequently present economic, operational and environmental benefits, although the reviewed studies do not unambiguously warrant immediate and full cooperation on grid governance.

40|$|Short and {{long-term}} power system planning models {{are becoming more}} complex in oSrder to capture current and future market characteristics comprising more variability, uncertainty, and integration of geographically spread market areas. Dimension reduction methods {{can be used to}} keep the planning models tractable, e. g. time series sampling and clustering, but they represent a trade-off between model complexity and level of detail. The accuracy of dimension reduction methods can be measured both in terms of raw data processing and model output metrics, where the latter reveals how well a sampling technique fits that particular model instance. In this study, the robustness of several sampling and clustering techniques is quantified with different model instances by independently varying model parameters, such as e. g. the marginal cost of generation. As the obtained findings indicate that the performance of the considered techniques is, indeed, model-dependent, more insight into the performance of common dimension reduction techniques in power system planning applications is provided. The results are illustrated by a case study of the <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> Offshore <b>Grid</b> (NSOG) for the scenario year 2030, using a bi-level mixed-integer linear optimization program.

The results of all samples analysed from the survey since 1946 are stored on an Access Database at the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science (SAHFOS) in Plymouth. The database is large, containing more than two million records (~ 80 million data points, if zero results are added) for more than 450 taxonomic entities. An open data policy is operated by SAHFOS.

40|$|AbstractThe {{geometry}} of the depositional facies and the sandbody continuity in turbidite and fluvial reservoirs controls the stratigraphic heterogeneity, and therefore controls permeability structure. This has implications for CO 2 injectivity from localized pressure build up around injection wells, and migration pathways due to dispersive flow, which results in CO 2 contacting more of the rock volume than {{would be the case}} in a homogenous system. This reservoir simulation study is an investigation of the impact of geological heterogeneity in channelized sandstone formations on pressure buildup during CO 2 injection. Four geological models of fluvial and turbidite depositional systems were constructed, typical of those which occur in the Southern <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> and the Central <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> regions. Model <b>grid</b> cells were reduced to less than 10 m in places to properly represent the individual channel structures and 2 m near wellbores. This presented a challenge for simulation to capture the impact of injectivity accurately with high resolution for a basin-scale model. Sensitivity studies were carried out in two groups with different net to gross (NTG) ratios and mean permeabilities. The simulation results showed that connectivity to sand-body volumes, through the individual fluvial channel interconnections, may be poor, and so CO 2 does not readily access the entire volume. Furthermore, if the mean permeability is less than 10 mD, only NTG, or the volume fraction of high permeability channels, affects the injectivity; the facies type, i. e. fluvial or turbidite, does not affect strongly the minimum injectivity for all models with 80 % sand...|$|R

40|$|An {{integrated}} approach to climate and energy policy {{is required to}} meet the challenges associated with climate changes caused by anthropogenic emissions. At the same time, the demand for electricity is increasing. Wind power is considered as part of the solution in solving these challenges, as this is renewable energy. By relocating wind power production offshore, stronger winds are achieved that increases electricity production without having emissions of GHG during power production. Europe's ambitious goals and plans for development of offshore wind power development in the <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> have also raised questions about how to integrate wind power into existing power systems in Europe. In this study the environmental impacts of offshore wind power production and development of an offshore <b>grid</b> in the <b>North</b> <b>Sea,</b> have been considered. To quantify the environmental impacts associated with offshore wind power generation and power transmission in the <b>North</b> <b>Sea,</b> several LCA’s have been carried out. Four LCA's were conducted, whereof three of them were analyses of various submarine cables used either in offshore wind farms or long-distance power transmission. The cables studied were; 33 kV HVAC cables used internally in offshore wind farms, 132 kV HVAC cables used to transmit power from a wind farm to the grid onshore and 450 kV HVDC cables used for long-distance power transmission between for instance countries. A fourth LCA was conducted of an entire offshore wind farm, including the inventories of the 33 kV and 132 kV cables. The emissions from a 390 MW offshore wind farm with bottom-fixed windmills, were calculated to be 20. 6 g CO 2 -equivalents/kWhel. Cabling constituted only 1. 5 % of the total impacts to climate change from the wind farm. A larger wind farm of 9000 MW had lower estimated emissions of 19. 8 g CO 2 -equivalents/kWhel due to a higher electricity production. The LCA results of the 450 kV cables were used in estimating the environmental impact caused by different designs of offshore power <b>grids</b> in the <b>North</b> <b>Sea.</b> Several alternative <b>grids</b> were investigated, both with and without wind farms. For instance, a power <b>grid</b> in the <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> where the two wind farms above were implemented, had estimated emissions of 84 million tonnes of CO 2 -equivalents throughout lifetime. This represents approximately 2 % of the EU- 27 countries' total GHG emissions from 2007. In addition to the quantification of environmental impacts, a qualitative discussion was conducted of the various environmental costs and benefits associated with large-scale development of power generation and transmission in the <b>North</b> <b>Sea.</b> The results from this study indicate that the expected environmental impacts from developing offshore wind farms and power <b>grids</b> in the <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> are not insignificant. The positive environmental effects are large because the increased transmission capacity between power markets allows for increased development of electricity generation from intermittent renewable energy sources like wind power. Increased share of renewable energy reduces the need for power generation from fossil fuels, thus there will be an environmental gain. The study seeks to emphasize the complexity and the important aspects of the assessment of environmental impacts associated with large power systems. </p...|$|R

The COBRAcable presents an interesting and unique case as it {{the first of its kind}} and likely involves the expansion of the interconnector in Germany territory. Large uncertainties are present due to different national regulatory regimes, diverse groups of stakeholders with different interests, and stochastic uncertainties due to the variability of renewable energy sources. A socio-economic framework has been designed to address the interdisciplinary nature of the problem of multi-terminal expansions. Scenarios of alternate futures are developed, and Monte Carlo analysis is performed to address the future energy characteristics and stochastic uncertainties respectively. It consists of a linear optimal power flow model where a simplified grid is being tested under multiple expansions that are selected in an expansion portfolio. The results will be quantitative costs and benefits of expansions as compared to a base case. Complementary, a qualitative stakeholder analysis is carried out to address the regulatory uncertainties that are not accounted for by the model.
