30|$|The use of {{experimentally}} derived protein structures and a hybrid computational method that combines {{the advantages of}} docking algorithms with dynamic structural information provided by molecular dynamics simulation techniques has been successfully applied {{to a number of}} systems and most recently, aid in the discovery of HER 2, H 1 N 1 and M 2 inhibitors (Yang et al. 2011; Tsai et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2011 a; Lai et al. 2011; Chang et al. 2011 e; Lin et al. 2011 b). In addition, molecular dynamic simulation could also be helpful in the analysis of mechanism of drug resistance. Recently, we have identified the mechanism of oseltamivir resistance by means molecular docking and molecular dynamics approach (Karthick et al. 2012). The available literature evidences suggests that two or three Arginine residues (150 loop) surrounding the carboxylic group of NA inhibitors {{play a key role in}} orienting and stabilizing various inhibitors (Russell et al. 2006). Our computational approach also correlates well with the experimental evidences.

40|$|Antibodies (Ab) to {{neuraminidase}} (<b>NA)</b> <b>play</b> {{a role in}} limiting influenza {{infection and}} might help reduce the disease impact. The most widely used serological assay to measure func-tional anti-NA immune responses is the Enzyme-Linked Lectin Assay (ELLA) which relies on hemagglutinin (HA) mismatched virus reassortants, or detergent treated viruses as the NA source to overcome interference associated with steric hindrance of anti-HA Ab present in sera. The difficulty in producing and handling these reagents, which are not easily adapted for screening large numbers of samples, limits the routine analysis of functional anti-NA Ab in clinical trials. In this study, we produced influenza lentiviral pseudoparticles (PPs) containing only the NA antigen (NA-PPs) with a simple two-plasmid co-transfection system. NA-PPs were characterized and tested as an innovative source of NA in the NA inhibition (NI) assay. Both swine A/California/ 07 / 2009 (H 1 N 1) and avian A/turkey/Turkey/ 01 / 2005 (H 5 N 1) N 1 s within NA-PPs retained their sialidase activity and were specifically inhibited by homologous and N 1 subtype-specific, heterologous sheep sera.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} the {{mechanism by which}} the matrix (M 1) protein associates with cellular membranes during influenza A virus assembly. Interaction of the M 1 protein with the viral hemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) glycoprotein was extensively analyzed by using wild-type and transfectant influenza viruses as well as recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the M 1 protein, HA, or NA. Membrane binding of the M 1 protein was significantly stimulated at the late stage of virus infection. Using recombinant vaccinia viruses, we found that a relatively small fraction (20 to 40 %) of the cytoplasmic M 1 protein associated with cellular membranes {{in the absence of}} other viral proteins, while coexpression of the HA and the NA stimulated membrane binding of the M 1 protein. The stimulatory effect of the NA (> 90 %) was significant and higher than that of the HA (> 60 %). Introduction of mutations into the cytoplasmic tail of the NA interfered with its stimulatory effect. Meanwhile, the HA may complement the defective NA and facilitate virus assembly in cells infected with the NA/TAIL(-) transfectant. In conclusion, the highly conserved cytoplasmic tails of the HA and <b>NA</b> <b>play</b> an important role in virus assembly...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{previous}} evidence that acetylcholine (ACh) and noradrenaline (<b>NA)</b> <b>play</b> a permissive role in developmental plasticity in the kitten visual cortex, we reinvestigated this {{topic in the}} postnatal visual cortex of rats with normal vision. In rats, the functional properties of visual cortical cells develop gradually between the second and the sixth postnatal week (Fagiolini et al., 1994). Cortical cholinergic depletion, by basal forebrain (BF) lesions at postnatal day (PD) 15 (eye opening), leads to a transient disturbance {{in the distribution of}} ocular dominance (Siciliano et al., 1997). In the present study, we investigated the development of visual cortical response properties following cytotoxic lesions of the locus coeruleus (LC) alone or in combination with lesions of cholinergic BF. The main result is that early NA depletion impairs the orientation selectivity of cortical neurons, causes a slight increase of their receptive-field size, and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio of cell responses. Similar effects are obtained following NA depletion in adult animals, although the effects of adult noradrenergic deafferentation are significantly more severe than those obtained after early NA depletion. Additional cholinergic depletion causes an additional transient change in ocular-dominance distribution similarly to that obtained after cholinergic deafferentation alone. Comparisons between depletion of NA {{on the one hand and}} depletion of both NA and ACh on the other suggest that the effects of combined deafferentation on the functional properties studied result from simple linear addition of the effects of depleting each afferent system alone...|$|E

In this study, we examined the effects of maternal diabetes on excitability, action potential (AP) properties, and small conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ (SK) currents of PCMNs. Neonatal mice from diabetic (OVE 26 female, NMDM) and normal (FVB female, control) mothers that had been mated with nondiabetic fathers (FVB male) were used. Tracer XRITC was injected into the pericardial sac at P 7 - 9 to retrogradely label PCMNs. Two days later, XRITC-labeled PCMNs were identified in brain stem slices. The responses of spike frequency, AP repolarization (half-width) and afterhyperpolarization (AHP) of PCMNs to current injections were studied using whole cell current clamp. Outward and afterhyperpolarization currents (IAHP) in response to voltage steps were measured using whole cell voltage clamp. In examining the effects of maternal diabetes on excitability and AP properties, we found that in NMDM spike frequency decreased, the half-width and AHP peak amplitude increased, and the peak amplitude of outward transient currents and IAHP increased compared with those measured in control. In examining the effects of maternal diabetes on SK channels, we found that after blockage of SK channels with a specific SK channel blocker apamin, maternal diabetes significantly increased apamin-sensitive outward transient currents and IAHP, and suppressed AHP amplitude in NMDM more than those in control. Further, apamin application increased the firing rate to current injections and completely abolished the difference of the firing rate between control and NMDM. We suggest that the augmented SK-mediated currents may contribute to the increased AHP amplitude and the attenuated excitability of PCMNs in NMDM...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} the phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) activators calcium ionophore A 23187, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), bradykinin (BK), histamine and noradrenaline (NA) on the 8 -iso-prostaglandin (PG) F 2 α formation in the isolated human umbilical vein and the isolated rabbit ear. For comparison, the influence of these substances on the thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) release was also investigated. The release of total (esterified as well as free) 8 -iso-PGF 2 α, free 8 -iso-PGF 2 α and TXB 2, the stable metabolite of TXA 2, was determined by specific enzyme immunoassays. The results show that bolus injections of 5. 4 [*]mmol H 2 O 2, 30 [*]nmol A 23187, 10 [*]nmol BK, 50 [*]nmol histamine and 20 [*]nmol NA caused an increased release of total 8 -iso-PGF 2 α in the umbilical vein and the rabbit ear. A perfusion with H 2 O 2 at a final concentration of 0. 3 [*]mM also increased the release of this isoprostane. Increased formation of free 8 -iso-PGF 2 α was induced by A 23187 injection and by both modes of H 2 O 2 administration, but not by the other treatments. Bolus injections of A 23187, BK and histamine induced an increased release of TXB 2 in both organs. Both modes of H 2 O 2 administration and NA showed no releasing effects. In conclusion, our results show that the substances used are able to stimulate the formation of 8 -iso-PGF 2 α concurrently with the release of PGs. This effect might be of pathophysiological relevance in inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases in which an enhanced release of free radicals, BK, histamine or <b>NA</b> <b>play</b> an important role...|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to determine whether 5 -HT 1 A receptors (a) modulate the activity of cardiac and bronchoconstrictor vagal preganglionic neurones (CVPNs and BVPNs) in the nucleus ambiguus (NA) and (b) are involved in pulmonary C-fibre afferent-evoked excitation of CVPNs, by right-atrial injections of phenylbiguanide (PBG). These experiments were carried out on α-chloralose-anaesthetized, artificially ventilated and atenolol (1 mg kg− 1) -pretreated cats. The ionophoretic application of 8 -OH-DPAT (a selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist) influenced the activity of 16 of the 19 CVPNs tested. 8 -OH-DPAT tended to cause inhibition at low currents (40 nA) and excitation at high currents (120 nA). The activity of 15 of these neurones increased {{in response to the}} application of 8 -OH-DPAT. In six of the CVPNs tested, this excitatory action of 8 -OH-DPAT was attenuated by co-application of the selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist WAY- 100635. The pulmonary C-fibre afferent-evoked excitation of eight CVPNs was attenuated by ionophoretic application of WAY- 100635. In three out of four CVPNs, the ionophoretic application of PBG caused excitation. In five out of the nine identified BVPNs that were tested with ionophoretic application of 8 -OH-DPAT, excitation was observed that was attenuated by WAY- 100635. WAY- 100635 (i. v. or intra-cisternally) also reversed bradycardia, hypotension and the decrease in phrenic nerve activity evoked by the i. v. application of 8 -OH-DPAT (42 μg kg− 1). In conclusion, the data indicate that 5 -HT 1 A receptors located in the <b>NA</b> <b>play</b> {{an important role in the}} reflex activation of CVPNs and BVPNs, and support the view that overall, these receptors play a fundamental role in the reflex regulation of parasympathetic outflow...|$|E
40|$|Two surface glycoproteins of {{influenza}} virus, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (<b>NA),</b> <b>play</b> opposite roles {{in terms of}} their interaction with host sialic acid receptors. HA attaches to sialic acid on host cell surface receptors to initiate virus infection while NA removes these sialic acids to facilitate release of progeny virions. This functional opposition requires a balance. To explore what might happen when NA of an influenza virus was replaced by one from another isolate or subtype, in this study, we generated three recombinant influenza A viruses in the background of A/PR/ 8 / 34 (PR 8) (H 1 N 1) and with NA genes obtained respectively from the 2009 pandemic H 1 N 1 virus, a highly pathogenic avian H 5 N 1 virus, and a lowly pathogenic avian H 9 N 2 virus. These recombinant viruses, rPR 8 -H 1 N 1 NA, rPR 8 -H 5 N 1 NA, and rPR 8 -H 9 N 2 NA, were shown to have similar growth kinetics in cells and pathogenicity in mice. However, much more rPR 8 -H 5 N 1 NA and PR 8 -wt virions were released from chicken erythrocytes than virions of rPR 8 -H 1 N 1 NA and rPR 8 -H 9 N 2 NA after 1 h. In addition, in MDCK cells, rPR 8 -H 5 N 1 NA and rPR 8 -H 9 N 2 NA infected a higher percentage of cells, and induced cell-cell fusion faster and more extensively than PR 8 -wt and rPR 8 -H 1 N 1 NA did in the early phase of infection. In conclusion, NA replacement in this study did not affect virus replication kinetics but had different effects on infection initiation, virus release and fusion of infected cells. These phenomena might be partially due to NA proteins ’ different specificity to a 2 - 3 / 2 - 6 -sialylate...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{begins with}} a {{molecular}} dynamics simulation of magnesium silicate glasses. Although an extensive literature addresses various techniques in studying the structure of x(MgO). (100 -x) (Si 02) glasses, this study has discussed in detail the environment of Mg atom {{and the presence of}} non-network oxygen atoms in these glasses. The average coordination number of magnesium by oxygen was increased from 4. 5 ± 0. 3 to 5. 0 ± 0. 3 by increasing x from 50 to 67. There are - 5 % non-network oxygen for x= 50 and the proportion increases up to 16 % for x= 67. Moreover, this study reported slight changes in Si-O and Mg-O environments; however, the changes in 0 - 0 correlations were noticeable in magnesium silicate glasses at pressures up to 9 GPa. Most of this thesis presents studies of the structure of a range of important iron phosphate glasses. The,effect of the, different oxidation states of Fe in xFeO. (100 -x) P 20 s glasses and xFe 203 ~(100 -X) P 20 S glasses has been investigated by building several models using molecular dynamics simulation. The short range order in these glass models is realistic, with a well-defined phosphate network, and both Fe 2 + and Fe 3 + ions were found to have a typical c~ordination of - 4. 5 in 40 FeO and 40 F~ 03 glasses. This thesis also includes modelling of multi-component phosphate glasses such as (P 20 S) sO(CaO) 3 o(Na 20 ho glass and sodium borophosphate glasses containing niobium. Both Ca and <b>Na</b> <b>play</b> the role of modifier in the (P 20 S) SO(CaO) 3 o(Na 20) 20 glass model with estimated.;. ' coordination numbers of 5 and 6 respectively. Sodium borophosphate glasses containing niobium models confirmed that Nb 06 octahedra prefer to be isolated at low Nb content, and connected to other Nb 06 at higher Nb content. A series of techniques was used to investigate the structure of sodium iron phosphate glasses prepared by melt quenching: X-ray and neutron diffraction, X- ray absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Mossbauer spectroscopy. The environment of both Fe and Na and their effect on IV • the chemical durability in phosphate glasses have been investigated. This study proposed that Fe-O coordination number in these glasses is in the range of 4. 8 - 5. 7 with a trend of decreasing the coordination number with increasing iron content. Whereas the Na coordination number of approx. 5 remains the same through different compositions. In depth structural studies have been carried out on amorphous FeP 04 prepared by two different methods, and on amorphous LiFeP 04 " prepared by electrochemical insertion of Li. The local environment of Fe in these samples was investigated using Mossbauer spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. X-ray and neutron diffraction "and transmission electron microscopy have been applied to elucidate the first complete structural study of these materials. The Fe environment in amorphous FeP 04 was found to be similar to that in quartz FeP 04 where every Fe is surrounded by four oxygen' atoms. However, the Fe environment in amorphous LiFeP 04 is affected by the appearance of Fe metal in this sample as a consequence of Li insertion. Small- angle scattering measurements confirmed the presence of nm-scale internal structure in the amorphous FeP 04 prepared by thermal decomposition and in amorphous LiFeP 04.
