40|$|Galileo {{is to be}} Europe’s own Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). It is {{expected}} to provide a highly accurate, guaranteed global positioning service under civilian control. It will be interoperable with the Global Positioning System (GPS), the US version of GNSS. Remarkably enough, whereas GPS was introduced as a purely military system, Galileo {{will be the first}} solely civilian GNSS, offering a great number of useful -everyday life- applications. It {{is expected}} to become fully operational by the year 2020 as part of Horizon 2020, the EU’s funding program for research and innovation. For the operation of Galileo, advanced technology will need to be employed. A number of satellites will be placed into fixed orbits in outer space; the satellites will be constantly emitting navigational signals indicating their position at any given time and in a very precise way. The navigational signals will be received by any person possessing the necessary technology, such as a GNSS receiver (the so-called navis technology). When receiving the signals from at least four satellites, the receiver can accurately pinpoint the position of persons and goods around the globe. There will be many benefits in using this technology, such as more efficient navigation of different modes of transportation (i. e. navigation of planes or ships). Besides navigational data, Galileo satellites will provide information for timing and positioning. Hence, various applications concerned with the synchronization of economic networks (i. e. at banks or financial institutions) or scientific applications related to the environment and meteorology are expected to emerge. Nonetheless, where there are advantages, there are also risks and legal challenges. Questions relating to the civil liability of the Galileo’s system operator {{in the event of a}} GNSS failure -especially liabilities connected to signal provision in space- have attracted significant interest lately. For example, a failure in signal provision (i. e. signal loss or an erroneous signal) resulting from negligence with respect to the GNSS operator may lead to damage scenarios with catastrophic consequences: an aircraft crash in a densely populated area, or a shipwreck with disastrous effects for the environment would be two examples. Following these observations, several questions must be asked from a liability law perspective. Inter alia: what are possible civil liability implications emanating from the advent of civilian versions of GNSS such as the EU’s Galileo? Can the provision of defective information from signals lead to liability implications? What would be the responses under current legal provisions? And lastly, what need may arise in the future for the initiation of a centralized approach, for instance a unified instrument, either at EU or international level, regulating liabilities for the signal in space provision? Interestingly enough, once the first GNSS structures such as the US GPS or Russian GLONASS became operational, the issue of liability from a signal failure was not of such significant concern in light of their mostly military nature. Presently, the situation has changed to an important extent: due to the advent of new non-military versions such as Galileo, the issue of liability connected to the provision of navigational signals has become topical. This research aims at examining the foregoing questions related to civil <b>liability</b> implications (mainly <b>non-contractual</b> <b>liabilities)</b> from the perspective of civilian versions of GNSS. The EU’s Galileo will be the most prevailing example examined in the present study. The research attempts to investigate the civil liability ramifications especially from the GNSS-Galileo operator’s perspective. Since the governance issues surrounding the operation of Galileo are still subject to debate, the research features two hypothetical case studies: on the one hand, a public governance scheme with the EU operating the system and possible liabilities against the EU, and on the other hand, a private governance scheme with a private entity operating the system and potential liabilities towards the private operator. Both case studies are examined from a de lege lata and a de lege ferenda perspective. Yet, the present research attempts to identify some future proposals. As it is argued, the issue of GNSS liability should be first regulated at regional level rather than international level. In this respect, the EU could, for example, possibly promote a future EU Regulation. Moreover, and as established by the analysis of the present study, such a Regulation should contain two elements, a substantive and procedural one. For the resolution of disputes connected to signal provision in space, the rule of strict liability and liability channeling onto the operator from a substantive viewpoint may depict the peculiarities contained within the field of satellite navigation more efficiently. Most importantly, and as far as the resolution of such disputes is concerned, this study argues that binding arbitration may be a plausible and alternative option to be considered in the foreseeable future. To this end, certain inspirations can potentially be drawn by the new PCA Rules of Arbitration on Outer Space Disputes adopted recently in December 2011...|$|R
40|$|Impartial legal {{enforcement}} {{provided by the}} state is considered necessary for impersonal exchange, implying that the scope of enforcement determines {{the extent of the}} market and hence the division of labor and related efficiency gains. Yet, the development of effective impartial legal systems provided by the state to govern exchange relationships is a rather recent phenomenon. What were, if any, the institutions that enabled impersonal exchange prior to that development? This paper addresses this question by examining the European experience. It utilizes a game theoretic framework and historical analysis to examine the Community Responsibility System (2 ̆ 2 CRS 2 ̆ 2) that enabled exchange characterized by separation between the quid and the quo over time and space that was impersonal, up to one 2 ̆ 7 s community affiliation. The CRS built on self-governed communities, intra-community (partial) enforcement institutions, and <b>non-contractual</b> joint communal <b>liability</b> in inter-community disputes that induced communities to care about their collective reputations. The analysis touches upon issues central to institutions: the optimal size of the legal responsibility unit as a function of different units 2 ̆ 7 ability to identify, monitor, and punish wrongdoers; the endogenous elicitation of impartial justice from partial courts; the role of self-governed organizations that fall between the ways in which we model the state and communities; the complementarities between reputational mechanisms and those relying on coercive power; the importance of the distinction between personal and communal identities; how institutions endogenously determine if agents condition entering an exchange on the revelation of information regarding personal and communal identity or past actions or both; and the importance of overlapping generations 2 ̆ 7 organizations, such as communities, in facilitating inter-organizational impersonal exchange based on reputation despite each individual 2 ̆ 7 s finite life span...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contains}} the conclusions {{from the work}} of the Economic Impact Group (EIG), a part of the CoPECL Network of Excellence funded by the EU to prepare a Draft Common Frame of Reference (DCFR). Part 1 revisits basic principles which are central to the work of the whole group. For one, contract law is not just about remedying market failures, it is fundamentally a basic condition for markets to exist at all. Moreover, law and economics analysis looks for Pareto-efficiency and total welfare, without taking distributional considerations into account. Part 2 summarizes the contributions of the EIG members: they dealt with general issues of contract law (function of contract law, good faith, non-discrimination), the formation and interpretation of contracts (including standard terms), contractual performance (choice of remedies, standard for the assessment of damages), termination (including long-term contracts), specific areas such as insurance and consumer law, as well as <b>non-contractual</b> <b>liability</b> (interplay between contract and tort law, limits to extra-contractual liability). Part 3 draws general conclusions from these contributions. As regards the first question before the EIG (desirability of harmonization at European level), the costs of harmonization have been downplayed, so that the case for harmonization has probably been exaggerated, certainly as regards areas such a <b>non-contractual</b> <b>liability</b> where the DCFR cannot simply be an optional regime. As regards the second question assessed by the EIG (appropriateness of the provisions chosen in the DCFR), the work of the EIG reveals shortcomings: among others, rules have been formulated without a complete assessment of their rationales and the ex ante impact of the DCFR has been ignored. The drafters of the DCFR could have derived more added value from an economic analysis of their work than they seemed to acknowledge. Accordingly, while the DCFR is a momentous work of scholarship, it rests on fragile foundations. ...|$|E
40|$|The non-contractual-contractual divide {{represents}} the basic criterion of qualification in private law liability. The essential {{difference between them}} is that whereas tortious obligation arises as a liability obligation i. e. as an obligation to pay damages, contractual obligation arises as a duty of performance which changes itself into an obligation of damages only in case of non-performance. What is true is that both contractual and extracontractual liability have damage in common, the objective element of every private law liability. The question is not always one of alternative between contractual and <b>non-contractual</b> <b>liability.</b> On the contrary, both {{can be thought of}} as being simoultaneously apt to rule single types of fact. A coincidence between contractual and <b>non-contractual</b> <b>liability</b> is typically the case when performance is so to say applied directly to the person or a good of the creditor, as in cases of medical practice or services in general. The counterway of a possible overlap is that in which conduct of debtor is not in itself non performance but infringes some other protected interest of creditor, giving rise to a tort. The judicial trend shows that courts talk of possible concurrence of tortious liability with the contractual one when this ends up in favour of the victim; on the other hand they opt for a purely contractual approach if this produces the only or most effective remedy for the victim. Through a analytical appraisal of the courts' attitude, the author concludes that the rule of concurrence in Italian law has only a sectorial range. This explains the idea manifested in literature, according to which concurrence between contractual and non contractual liability hardly can be justified in dogmatic terms, whereas it appears to find only reasons of «pure equity and contingent empiricism»...|$|E

Is the solution reached in common law jurisdictions different than that in civil law jurisdictions? Or do completely divergent outcomes arise within similar legal systems?

As exemplary illustrated by the Hormones and Bananas disputes, when the EC fails to comply with a ruling by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body, even though it does so in pursuit of a greater public interest, it opens the door for countermeasures against it. In particular, by deciding not to bring its measures into conformity with WTO law, the EC offers protection to those categories of operators active in the sector in which the trade conflict has arisen from external competition, while at the same time it exposes other categories of traders, which have nothing to do with the original dispute, to countermeasures. By doing so, the Community de facto give rise to a redistribution of income across segment of society, without being in control though of which category of Community economic operators will bear the cost of its decision not to comply.

For this reason, every medical institution is legally obliged to have relevant medical devices.

On the other hand, in case the medial institutions fail to provide needed care or violate their obligation to use medical devices when necessary, it is regarded as medical negligence (professional error).

The {{purpose of the}} first part is to analyse how the court may interpret rules, principles and legal cases to decide whether a reconstructor bears liability towards the debtor and the creditors. In the second part it is discussed and argued for how the reconstructor´s damage liability should be drawn up and applied so that it according to economic theories should be as efficient as possible. In the thesis it is shown {{that it is not}} a <b>non-contractual</b> <b>liability</b> or a liability based on authority mission. The reconstructor´s liability is instead based on a commission concerning an intellectual service. The court is the mandator of the commission, but the debtor must be regarded as the principal. The reconstructor is liable towards the debtors on contractual grounds, the relationship can be considered as equivalent to contract. The reconstrucotr´s liablity does not fall under the limitation rules in HB 18 : 9 but falls under the limitation rules in Preskriptionslagen. In the second part, dealing with theories of Law and Economics, it is shown that a negligence rule is the most efficient. The reconstructor´s liability, according to the analysis of Swedish law, would thereby be efficient. A problem lies however in the fact that the parties does not know for sure which liability rule that is in force. This is inefficient while it can lead to that the parties observes a too low activity level, observes a too low level of care or take too many, costly, safety measures. This problem can best be solved through a non-mandatory law which allows the parties to rely entirely on the law or to make a contract where the gaps are being covered by the law...|$|E

De allí la necesidad de determinar el esquema de resolución al problema jurídico que formula la justicia administrativa con el fin de identificar sus particularidades y establecer la hoja de ruta trazada a la reparación de una de las violaciones más flagrantes a los derechos humanos y el Derecho Internacional HumanitarioInitially {{the theory of}} repairing {{the damage caused by}} act or omission attributable to the state as a subject faced the dogma of irresponsibility. This was a paradigm that {{in the context of the}} new constitutional law should not be allowed any validity because it is not a case of the exercise of a divine power or Leviathan because of its superiority over the inhabitants; as institutionalist theses of yore held. However; as it will be evident; there is some jurisprudence position that reminds us of those theses concerning the state responsibility because of the case of displaced persons and there are doctrinal realities that pose their attenuated return since the law of <b>non-contractual</b> <b>liability</b> appears as an option which is ill-suited for the victims. Hence the need to determine the pattern of resolution to the legal problem posed by the Administrative Justice in order to identify its characteristics and to establish the road map drawn to repair one of the most flagrant violations of human rights and humanitarian international law...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study on the {{protection}} of the consumer of foodstuffs in the European Union, reference will be specifically made to the history and policy of consumerism and to the complex protection of the food consumer as a specific category. The issue of information about foods needs indeed to be analysed from both the producer’s and the consumer’s perspectives. The producer must inform; the consumer has the right to be informed. <b>Non-contractual</b> <b>liability</b> as protection of the food consumer is the key of the study paper together with the protection of health as the right to information and labelling claims. Chapter I refers to the EU consumer protection policy and {{to the development of the}} movement in Europe. Importance is given to the notion of consumer as fundamental party in the contracts governed by EU law, to both producer’s duty to inform and the consumer’s right to be informed. That does not concern the final consumer of foodstuffs specifically, but rather the “consumer” in all the types of contracts in which the consumer is included. Chapter II analyzes the area of food and nutrition information as a goal for the European policy- makers and the European Union’s regime for regulating health claims made on food in commercial communications. A deep study of the Reg. 1924 / 2006 on nutrition information and health claims is conducted. Chapter III refers to Reg. 1169 / 2011 on the provision of food information to consumers as a corollary of the European system of consumer protection. The final part of the paper is indeed focused on the food labelling in the new EU legislation and to the concept of the so-called average consumer and to the role of the label. The right to information can be considered as the synthesis of the obligations imposed to the producer, of the legal instruments needed for communication and most of all, of the relation between who informs and who receives. Thus, the status of the consumer is a new status. He/she tends to be more and more informed and aware. Food safety nowadays does not only protect from unfair practices and promotes health protection. It also pursues another interest: the interest to be informed. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: In recent years, the Italian Supreme Court stated {{principles}} that led to: a) {{an increase in}} damages awarded to patients and premiums demanded by insurance, resulting in increased health care costs, b) the birth and growth of the so-called defensive medicine with major economic repercussions. The Italian legislator has tried to remedy the spread of defensive medicine by Law no. 189 / 2012. Objectives: The authors illustrate the actual innovations made by the legislature in medical liability system developed by the Italian Supreme Court in the last fifteen years. The authors analyze {{the question of the}} suitability of the reform: a) to eliminate the practice of defensive medicine; b) {{to reduce the amount of}} expenditure for compensation; c) to increase the serenity of the doctors in the practice. Methods: The authors analyze the effects of the new rules and compare them with the principles laid down by the Supreme Court on negligence, contractual liability and personal injury. Results/Discussion and Conclusions: Law no. 189 / 2012 confirms that the guidelines are not binding. In fact, the doctor who meets the guideline can also be declared liable when the circumstances of the case made ​​not applicable to the guideline itself. However, the legislative reform states that if the physician observes guidelines should not be applied, the penal responsibility can be established only when the conduct constitutes gross negligence of the doctor. Therefore, the legislator has decriminalised negligence. This new rule raises first issues of unconstitutionality. Furthermore, the application of a guideline also aimed to reduce health care spending could be considered as gross negligence because the Italian Supreme Court has stated that the predominance of the patient's health over economic interests of medical facilities is a basic rule. As a result, the doctor would still be convicted. With regard to civil liability, the legislative reform states that when there is ordinary negligence, the duty laid down in article 2043 of the Civil Code applies. Although the article 2043 of the Civil Code relates only to the pecuniary loss and <b>non-contractual</b> <b>liability,</b> the reform does not appear to change either the contractual nature of the medical liability or the obligation to compensate also the biological damage and the loss for pain and suffering. In fact, the law n. 189 / 2012 refers only to the obligation under article 2043 Civil Code, i. e. the obligation to compensate contra ius damages. As a result, article 2043 does not refer to the nature of liability, whether contractual or non-contractual. In addition, the concept of contra ius damage may also include the biological damage and the loss for pain and suffering. Otherwise, the legislative reform would be unconstitutional. Concerning the quantification of damages, the reform states that the court must take into account the fact that the physician has complied with the guidelines. But this rule determines unequal treatment of patients because the same damage caused with the same degree of negligence would be compensated with different amounts depending on whether or not the doctor has followed the guidelines. Therefore, the suitability of the reform to reduce health costs for compensation and for defensive medicine is very questionable...|$|E
40|$|Abstract While {{the initial}} preparatory steps were taken for the French Civil Code, a work which {{had such a}} great {{influence}} {{in the history of}} the western civil law, the legal expert Tarride said: “The law protects the citizens: whoever suffers a damage shall always find someone to repair it”. Nevertheless, as it is known, article 1382 of this code did not embed a solution so wide and generous for the victims; it followed the teachings of Domat, and it examined the fault; in other words, it does not order to indemnify all damages caused, but only the culpably caused damages. It is a question of a “law of closure” of a tort liability which, basically, is sustained by five articles. Soon after the sanction of this code, the fault proved itself insufficient, by itself, to cover all the scenarios which are worth be protected. Moreover, the plurality and diversity of situations implied a more detailed regulation. It is stated that “In a world where an accident is encountered at every corner, at every work place, in every house, where the individual liberties, though solemnly proclaimed, are breached daily, it is necessary to repair, to regulate and to sanctio”. The function of repair has always been essential for the invoked civil liability; the function of sanction, as seen later, continues to be seen as subject of discussions. The one related to the older regulation is connected to the process of “decoding”; in fact, until the conciliation of this phenomenon, the evolution of the civil liability, especially of the non-contractual one, has been almost exclusively the fruit of the jurisprudential work and not of the lawmaker: “The civil liability law is built from scarce legal principles; to a great extent, it is a judicial law; it is the judges who, by carrying out a permanent work of interpretative recreation, of carefully looking at a changing social reality, with its correlative alteration of mentalities, have completed the legal order with a complex of rules, derived from the necessity of solving the multiform conflicts using criteria which do not simply flow from legal provisions extremely syncopated”. Similar reflections result from the pages of one of the most respected Italian law teachers; I am referring to Francesco Galgano, who states that, just as before they said that the law reform is sufficient to make a library useless, today it is safe to say that such a uselessness may come from the change of the jurisprudence, and he draws attention to the fact that, in spite of the unaltered seventeen articles of the 1948 civil code dedicated to the <b>non-contractual</b> <b>liability,</b> the changes in the field are enormous. Therefore, it may be stated that in the field of the civil law, the theory of the liability is the one which, through the work of the judges, has produced the greatest changes. Anyway, it is necessary to point out that the permanent creation of jurisprudence is not always peacefully accepted unanimously. In Spain, Diez Picazo underlines that “The civil liability law or the tort law finds itself in a very sensible point of uncertainty due to the convergences of the doctrinal and jurisprudential tendencies which have pushed, in the last decades of its evolution, towards a very significant extension and, at the same time, the factors which advise submitting it to a certain amount of restriction; the intention to favor at maximum the viability of the indemnities has placed the legal system in a certain crisis”...|$|E
40|$|The paper aims {{to provide}} a legal {{analysis}} of project finance, examining profiles and civil problems arising from the legal instrument, also through comparative insights. In particular, the paper develops in three directions: (i) analysis of the overall phenomenon, in public contracts area {{as well as in}} the private contracts context; (ii) examination of the aforesaid theoretical framework as a whole; (iii) the existence of a legal obligation to renegotiate between the parties themselves. As regards the first issue after a brief reconstruction of the economic phenomenon and the analysis of the essential features of the project finance, the unity of the purpose of the contract was emphasized, arguing that its application in public or private contexts does not alter the nature of the contract itself that remains, therefore, the same. And in fact, the rules contained in the Italian Public Contract Code concerning the project financing cannot be considered neither as a discipline of the legal instrument nor as the discipline of the legal relations existing between the parties; rather the abovementioned rules should be considered as an adaptation of the funding model to the specific needs of the public sector. Therefore, the validity of a general unique scheme is not altered: it is therefore characterized by the presence of specific elements in both areas, public and private: this being true, the legal issues raised by the legal instruments of private and public project finance have been jointly dealt with. As for the second issue, after investigated the relationships existing among the stakeholders of the project finance, the thesis sustained is that the most convincing qualification of the legal tool supporting the economic operation should described as a unique multilateral contract with common purpose, thus rejecting the more common qualification as ‘connected contract’. Once the distinction between ‘connected contracts’ and a unique multilateral contract with common purpose has been imputed to the existence of a unitary consideration, it has been argued that in the project finance the unitary consideration consists in splitting the risk of the project among the involved parties to the contract. This thesis seems confirmed by the special operational guarantees asset, as well as by the conditioning mechanism by which the loan agreement is subject to the existence of construction building, management, supply and sales contracts, while in turn, the abovementioned contracts are subject to the condition precedent consisting in the fulfillment of the loan contract. More precisely: evidence of the common purpose is given by the existence of a common interest of all the stakeholders of the economic operation. A first commonality can be perceived among SPV and lenders, through a parallelism with the Italian agriculture associative agreements and their corresponding institutions in Islamic finance. A second commonality can be highlighted among SPV and the other “satellite” participants, thus assuming a compatibility between exchange contracts and associated contracts, as noted by some academics in the area of network contracts. Consequently, art. 1420 of the Italian civil code would apply, thus avoiding the implications of the principle simul stabunt simul cadent applied to ‘connected contracts’. In other words: the interest of the parties to the fulfillment of the project is, in fact, confirmed by the systematic presence of a specific contractual clause, defined as “terms of survival of the project”. In relation to the third and final point, project finance proves to be an elective ground for renegotiation as appropriate remedy. The legal obligation - now expressly regulated in the German, Dutch and Greek Civil Code as well as implicitly subsisting in the U. S. system - proves to be accepted in the Italian legal system, where it is based on the principle of good faith in the performance of the contract, as interpreted in the light of solidarity constitutional values ?? protected by art. 2 of the Italian Constitution. Additionally, the unified framework of project finance would be consistent with the need to overcome the logic of relativity of contractual fragments, as demonstrated both by the English academic debate now reflecting on the role of sanctity of contract and on the concept of connected contracts, and by the French experience in the area of contractual ‘indivisibilté’. Not every relationship established between the parties is contractual stricto sensu, since there are bilateral agreements: nevertheless, the close “organisational relation” generated leads to reflect on the opportunity to allow an extension of limitation or exclusion liability objections also between the parties of the global operation not linked themselves by a contract and to conclude that there is a responsibility among them that exceed the forms of <b>non-contractual</b> <b>liability.</b> The observations proposed hereabove would lead to a reinterpretation of the borderline between the two legal instruments, ‘connected contracts’ and multilateral contracts, thus leading to the conclusion that there is a legal obligation to renegotiate in both contractual schemes, as both can be defined as relational contracts...|$|E
