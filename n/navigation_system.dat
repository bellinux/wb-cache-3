40|$|Abstract: Car <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> are {{now widely}} used, whereas {{pedestrian}} <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> {{have not yet}} found widespread application. Current pedestrian <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> are designed analogously to car <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> where the movement of vehicles is constrained by the street network (specifically the lanes). Such a wayfinding model {{does not reflect the}} possibilities of pedestrians, where movement is subject to different constrains compared to car drivers. In this paper we describe a new pedestrian wayfinding model that addresses this problem. A graph model is created which consists of decision points and edges connecting them. The free (walkable) space around decision points is expanded to decision scenes where pedestrian movement is modeled in more detail, thus allowing for flexible navigation comparable to unassisted pedestrians. We connect this model with the cognitive needs of users of pedestrian <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> and show how our approach incorporates these. ...|$|R
