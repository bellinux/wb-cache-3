In each experiment, inocula with the AMF species Funneliformis mosseae, Glomus cubense and Rhizoglomus intraradices were applied, and there was a control without inoculation. A randomized block design with a 4 (inocula) x 2 (legume species) factorial arrangement was used giving 8 treatments and 4 replications. AMF inocula were applied at sowing by the seed-coating method, and legume yield, the frequency and intensity of mycorrhizal root colonization and macronutrient concentrations in aboveground biomass were evaluated. The legumes responded positively to AMF inoculation, but the effectiveness of the AMF species depended on the soil type. Rhizoglomus intraradices was more effective with respect to the frequency and intensity of mycorrhizal root colonization and in improving the nutritional status and yield of legumes grown in the Vertisol, whereas G. cubense was more effective for those grown in the <b>Nitisol.</b> Studies are required to identify the soil factors that determine the effectiveness of AMF.

The constant of the water infiltration rate into the soil varies significantly with the soil type (30. 2 mm h- 1 in the <b>Nitisol</b> and 6. 6 mm h- 1 in the Cambisol), regardless of the management system, application time and rain intensity and duration. At the end of rainfalls, soil-water infiltration varies significantly with the management system, with the timing of application and rain intensity and duration, with values ranging from 13 to 59 mm h- 1, in the two studied soils.

As human exposure to chlordecone is mainly due to food contamination, early research was focused on chlordecone transfer to crops. Field trials were conducted to investigate chlordecone contamination of yam, sweet potato, turnip, and radish grown on a Ferralic <b>Nitisol</b> polluted by chlordecone. We also carried out trials on yam, courgette, and tomato under greenhouse conditions with homogenized Andosol and <b>Nitisol,</b> polluted by chlordecone to various extents. Our results indicated that i) all tubers were contaminated in accordance with the chlordecone content of the soils; ii) the plant contamination capacity of the <b>Nitisol</b> was greater than that of the Andosol; and iii) whatever the soil type, tuber contamination was related to the soil volumetric content of dissolved chlordecone. Nevertheless, no tubers showed sufficient chlordecone uptake for efficient soil decontamination by means of plant extraction. Soil contact accounted for most of the root crop contamination, which was inversely proportional to the tuber size. Internal transfer might also increase root crop contamination when the root central cylinder contained raw sap flow, {{as in the case of}} turnip or radish. Courgette fruits showed high contamination without soil contact. Thus, further research is needed to explore the pattern of both below- and aboveground plant chlordecone contamination and assess the hypothesis of its correlation with sap flow.

Under the large scale government led SWC program, terraces with infiltration furrows were installed in 2012. The results indicate that runoff, sediment loads and sediment yields decreased significantly after the implementation of SWC practices. Sediment loads were reduced mainly because of the reduced runoff. Though sediment concentration decreased in the sub-watersheds, it decreased only marginally for the main watershed because of the entrainment of loose soil from the collapse of unstable banks of gullies. Infiltration furrows were effective in collecting runoff and suspended sediment (from rills) on the hillsides where <b>Nitisols</b> dominate (very deep, well-drained, permeable soils where rain water could infiltrate easily). But, on the saturated flat bottom lands and fields dominated by vertisols (that form wide-deep cracks during the dry season and swell during the rainy season), infiltration was restricted and conservation practices became conduits for carrying excess rainfall. Our continuous observations and photo monitoring of bunds on <b>Nitisols</b> and saturated bottomlands indicate that installing soil bunds on these areas caused the collapse of soil bunds in to the furrows. The soil from the collapsed bund is then easily washed away in a concentrated runoff and further initiated gullies in the Debre Mawi watershed. Large scale soil and water conservation interventions have short term effectiveness of reducing runoff and sediment loads. However, long term benefits can only be sustained with continuous maintenance of uphill infiltration furrows, as most ditches are filled up with sediments within two-three years. In addition, large scale soil and water conservation interventions should give priority to gully treatments, should consider local soil types and saturation dynamics to install bunds in the sub-humid Ethiopian highlands...|$|R

We studied water potentials ranging from 0 to - 700 kPa on undisturbed soil and on soil previously frozen to get rid of living nematodes. Mortality of adult R. similis decreased regularly, and was fairly well described by Teissier's model. In the previously frozen soils, R. similis survived longer in wet soils (half-life of 21 - 46 days at 0 to - 5 kPa) than in dry soils (half-life of less than 10 days between - 80 and - 250 kPa).

Farmers {{need to be able}} to foresee the risk of not complying with the regulatory threshold in each field and for each crop, if not, farmers whose fields are contaminated would have to stop cultivating certain crops in the fields concerned. To help farmers make the right choices, we studied the relationship between contamination of the soil and contamination of crops. We showed that contamination of a crop by CLD depended on the crop concerned, the soil CLD content and the type of soil. We grouped crop products in three categories: (i) non-uptakers and low-uptakers, (ii) medium-uptakers, and (iii) high-uptakers, according to their level of contamination and the resulting risk of exceeding MRL. Using a simulation model, we computed the soil threshold required to ensure the risk of not complying with MRL was sufficiently low for each crop product and soil type. Threshold values ranged from 0. 02 μgkg− 1 for dasheen grown in <b>nitisol</b> to 1. 7 μgkg− 1 for yam grown in andosol in the high-uptake category, and from 1 μgkg− 1 for lettuce grown in <b>nitisol</b> to 45 μgkg− 1 for the leaves of spring onions grown in andosol in the medium-uptake category.

Phosphorus level &times; weed control interaction over three years significantly (P &le; 0. 05) affected faba bean seed yield at Rob Gebeya but not at Welmera. Phosphorus application at the rates of 10, 20 and 30 kg P ha- 1 resulted in mean seed yield increases compared to the control of 20, 41 and 53 %, respectively on the average of locations; 13, 33 and 51 %, respectively at Welmera, and 26, 48 and 55 %, respectively at Rob Gebeya. Weeding once increased mean seed yields of faba bean by 25 % on the average (35 and 17 % at Welmera and Rob Gebeya, respectively) compared to unweeded check. Seed yield {{was positively correlated with}} total biomass and number of pods per plant (r = 0. 95 *** and 0. 75 ***, respectively) at Welmera, and (r = 0. 94 *** and 0. 55 **, respectively) at Rob Gebeya. The results of economic analysis indicated that the highest marginal rate of return was obtained from weeding once six weeks after crop emergence and application of 20 kg P ha- 1, which is economically the most feasible alternative on <b>Nitisols</b> of central Ethiopian highlands...|$|R
30|$|A {{greenhouse}} {{experiment was}} performed on a silty clay soil classified as Eutric <b>Nitisols,</b> collected from the Endibir area (Central Ethiopia). For soil collection, the fields of 20 farmers were purposely selected based {{on the extent of}} soil acidity. Soil samples were collected from 0 to 20  cm depth at random from the fields of these 20 farmers and mixed well. The dried soil sample was passed through a 4 -mm sieve to eliminate coarse rock and plant material and thoroughly mixed to ensure uniformity. A subsoil sample of about 1  kg was taken, air dried, and passed through a 2 -mm sieve and used for the determination of physical and chemical characteristics. A part of the homogenized soil sample was ground to pass through a 0.5 -mm sieve for the analysis of N, organic matter (OM), Cu, Zn, Fe and Mn concentrations.|$|R
40|$|In the French West Indies, {{chlordecone}} (CLD), an organochlorine pesticide, {{which is}} highly persistent in the environment, was applied in banana plantations from 1972 to 1993 against the banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus. Pollution surveys conducted in 2001 by the French Department of Health revealed {{the presence of}} chlordecone in soils, rivers, springs over large areas in Guadeloupe and Martinique islands. Contamination of drinking water, food crops, aquatic species by CLD has been observed {{as well as its}} presence in blood of men, pregnant women and newborns. There is therefore a large social concern about the extent and evolution of CLD pollution in the French West Indies and its impact on human health and ecosystems. From 2008 to 2012 a multidisciplinary project CHLORDEXCO took place to study the CLD fate in water, soils and the contamination characteristics of aquatic species and food crops. Here, we summarize results obtained on the processes controlling the spatial and temporal patterns of soil and water contamination at the scale of the banana cropping area in Guadeloupe and of the Perou catchment. The main soils in the contaminated areas are andosols and <b>nitisols</b> and formed from the weathering of volcanic ashes. They have a high organic carbon content and high content of secondary minerals, allophane for andosols and halloysite for <b>nitisols.</b> An analysis of the spatial distribution of CLD in soil over 1045 field plots showed that the soil type had a strong impact. Andosols, with a high sorption capacity (Koc 20 000 L/kg), had the highest CLD concentrations and stocks, unlike <b>Nitisols,</b> which had 10 -fold lower sorption capacities. A significant « farm effect », due to between-farm variations of application times and amounts, was also noticed. The observed stocks of CLD clearly correspond to the accumulation in soil of successive treatments and thereby confirm the high persistence of CLD in soil also observed in incubation studies in soil microcosms. Soil column studies of the transport of aged CLD however showed that CLD concentration in percolation water varied little (5 to 10 μg/L) and were of same magnitude for both soils although their sorption properties and hydrodynamic behaviours differed with larger macropore flow in the andosols. At catchment scale, contamination of surface waters was permanent with CLD concentrations one order of magnitude less than in percolation water. Temporal variations of contamination were due to dilution effects caused by water from uncontaminated uphill areas. CLD concentrations were highest in base flow indicating that the main pathway of applied CLD to surface waters is by percolation and groundwater flow. In conclusion, contamination of soil and water in the banana cropped areas of the French West Indies is general and permanent. If no soil remediation strategies can be elaborated this severe environmental contamination will last over centuries as estimated by Cabidoche et al. (2009, Environ. Poll., 57, 1697 - 1705). Since CLD propagates mainly by subsurface flow, buffer strips, usually recommended in many regions to limit the pollution of water by pesticides, will not be useful...|$|R
30|$|Much of the <b>Nitisol</b> {{areas in}} the Ethiopian {{highlands}} are characterized by humid to sub-humid agro-climatic conditions (Elias 2016). The main monsoon rains {{over much of the}} Ethiopian highlands are influenced by the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) weather system as blown from the Atlantic Ocean. The average annual rainfall ranges between 1300 and 1600  mm in the north-central highlands that falls between June and September months. The rainy season is much extended in the south-western highlands spanning from February to October with average annual rainfall in the range of 1800 – 2000  mm. The mean annual air temperature in much of the Ethiopian highlands is 22 – 25  °C (Elias 2016). According to Eswaren (1988) the Ethiopian highlands are categorized by udic soil moisture and hyperthermic soil temperature regimes.|$|E

The dominant {{soil of the}} region is Pellic Vertisol (277.23  km 2) which {{is found in the}} Southern and North East part of the city. Eutric <b>Nitisol</b> (111.55  km 2) is the second most dominant soil found in the central and North West part of the region. Vertisol is characterized by fine textured soil with >[*] 60 % clay in composition. As a result, the porosity of such soil is very fine making the movement of material difficult within the soil. Hence, the permeability of Vertisol is very low except within the cracks that are formed during dry seasons.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} TF values for 90 Sr and 137 Cs were {{measured}} for reference plants grown in lysimeters containing soils representative of large agricultural areas in Brazil: Ferralsol, <b>Nitisol</b> and Acrisol. These results were {{discussed in the}} light of pedological analyses and results from the follow sequential chemical extraction protocol: 1) slightly acidic phase containing readily bioavailable elements; 2) easily reducible phase containing elements bound to Mn oxides; 3) oxidizable phase containing elements bound to labile organic matter; 4) alkaline phase containing mainly elements bound to Fe compounds; 5) resistant phase not potentially available to crops. These results showed that the main soil factors influencing the 137 Cs transfer to these soils were: exchangeable K, organic matter and iron oxides content. These results showed that 90 Sr plant uptake was influenced by exchangeable Ca. All these finds are in accord with previous studies and seems confirm the vulnerability of Ferralsol and Acrisol to 137 Cs contamination. 1...|$|E
40|$|River Nyando is one {{of seven}} major rivers within the Kenyan side of the Lake Victoria Drainage Basin. The other six rivers are Sio, Nzoia, Yala, Mara, Sondu-Miriu and Kuja- Migori. The Nyando and Nzoia rivers have been the main sources of {{seasonal}} flooding in downstream areas before their waters enter Lake Victoria. The Nyando has its tributaries originating from the Nandi and Tindiret Hills in South and North Nandi Districts and Londiani, Tindiret and West Mau Forests in Kericho and Nakuru Districts. River Nyando has a total length of 170 km and a catchment area of 3450 km 2. The Nyando Drainage Basin consists of five main sub-catchment areas namely:- Nyando-Nandi; Nyando-Kericho; Awach-Kano; Nyaidho-Kano; and Nyando-Kano. More than 50 % of the total water discharge of the Nyando comes from the Nyando-Nandi sub-catchment area. River Nyando traverses Londiani, Kipkelion and Sigowet areas of Kericho District and Koru, Muhoroni, Chemelil, Lower Nyakach and Kano Plains areas of Nyando District. Londiani, West Mau, Kipkelion, Sigowet and Koru areas form the highlands zone whereas Muhoroni, Chemelil, Lower Nyakach and Kano Plains form the lowlands zone of the drainage basin. The highlands zone {{is characterized by a}} very rugged terrain particularly in Kipkelion, Aldai, Kaptumo, and Tinderet Divisions. The mean annual rainfall ranges between 1000 mm (in Tinderet Forest) and 1600 mm (in Kipkelion). The total land areas covered by West Mau Forest, Kipkelion and Londiani are 573 km 2, 441 km 2 and 238 km 2 respectively. The average annual rainfall for these areas is 1660 mm, 1390 mm and 1250 mm respectively. The dominant soils in the highlands zone include <b>Nitisols,</b> Phaeozems, Luvisols and Cambisols. These soils are well drained, deep and dark reddish brown sandy clay loam to clay. The Phaeozems and Cambisols are dominant in Kipkelion and have a rocky or stony surface. The <b>Nitisols</b> are found in the West Mau Forest area. Most of the soils in the highlands are overlain by humic topsoi...|$|R

According to FAO (2006), the gradient is gently sloping (0 – 7 %) comprising 48.5 % (12, 682  ha) and strongly sloping (8 – 16 %) with 37.13 % (9714  ha) areal {{coverage of the}} catchment. The moderately steep (16 – 30 %) and steep slope (>[*] 30 %) that cover about 11.22 % (2936  ha) and 3 % (787  ha) respectively, are commonly found in the south-east and southern corners of the catchment. Slopes more than 16 % are largely found along the south-east and southern margins of the catchment, locally called Senemariam, Debresina, and Laguna upland areas. Gleysols (54.9 %) and <b>Nitisols</b> (30.5 %) constitute the major soil types of the Gelda catchment. However, Gleysols are poorly drained with seasonal water accumulation (FAO 1997). The other soils types such as Regosols and Luvisols are commonly found on the sloping lands.|$|R
40|$|Chlordecone (CLD), an {{organochlorine}} insecticide, {{and other}} {{persistent organic pollutants}} continue to contaminate the environment worldwide and have adverse effects on human health through food exposure. Cucurbitaceae take up weathered hydrophobic pollutants from the soil and translocate them to their shoots. As Cucurbitaceae {{are an important part}} of the diet in the French West Indies, they are among the main contributors to total dietary intake of CLD. We analyzed the contamination by CLDs (CLD and 5 b-hydroCLD) of four cucurbits grown in the field and/or in the greenhouse. Different physiological (crop species) and environmental (soil type, growth conditions) variables were shown to influence uptake of the pollutant from the soil by the crop. Cucurbita species (zucchini and pumpkin) were more contaminated than Cucumis sativus (cucumber), and Sechium edule (christophine or chayote) translocated CLDs to fruits very poorly compared with cucumber and pumpkin. Greenhouse conditions and non-allophanic (<b>nitisols</b> and ferralsols) soils favored plant contamination more than field conditions and allophanic soils (andosols). (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
