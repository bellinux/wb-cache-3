5|$|The surface {{interval}} (SI) or surface interval time (SIT) is {{the time}} spent by a diver at surface pressure after a dive during which inert gas which was still present {{at the end of}} the dive is further eliminated from the tissues. This continues until the tissues are at equilibrium with the surface pressures. This may take several hours. In the case of the US Navy 1956 Air tables, it is considered complete after 12 hours, The US Navy 2008 Air tables specify up to 16 hours for <b>normal</b> <b>exposure.</b> but other algorithms may require more than 24 hours to assume full equilibrium.|$|E
500|$|At {{the surface}} the {{remaining}} excess of absorbed inert gases from the dive are eliminated as time passes. When completely [...] "desaturated" [...] {{the levels of}} those gases in the diver's body have returned to those normal at atmospheric pressure. The interval to complete desaturation varies depending upon {{factors such as the}} depth and duration of the dive, the altitude of the dive, the gas mixtures breathed on the dive, and the decompression strategy used. The maximum interval until desaturation is considered to have occurred depends on the decompression algorithm in use. On the BSAC 88 dive table it is deemed to take 16 hours. The US Navy tables revision 5 considered the diver unsaturated in 12 hours for <b>normal</b> <b>exposure,</b> and the Buhlmann tables allow 24 hours for the slowest tissues to fully desaturate after a long dive.|$|E

5000|$|This {{breakdown}} in the usual tradeoff between aperture and shutter speed is known as reciprocity failure. Each different film type has a different response at low light levels. Some films are very susceptible to reciprocity failure, and others much less so.

Conversely some films that are [...] "slow" [...] under <b>normal</b> <b>exposure</b> duration retain their light sensitivity better at low light levels.|$|E

50|$|A {{half-frame camera}} is a camera using a film format at half the {{intended}} exposure format. A common variety is the 18&times;24 mm format on regular 135 film.

30|$|Recent {{regulatory}} judgements on glyphosate {{cancer risk}} in the US and Europe are based upon an assessment of general population, dietary exposures under typical conditions, and do not take into account, nor reflect a detailed evaluation of the sometimes much-higher levels of exposure that occur {{in a variety of}} occupational mixer/loader and applicator scenarios [15], e.g., hand-held, backpack, ATV, and truck-mounted sprayers that require a person to hold and direct an application wand. Such applications lead to much higher dermal exposures compared to applicators working inside tractor or sprayer cabs. In addition, applying a GBH many days per year for several hours per day inevitably leads to greater, routine dermal exposures, as well as more numerous incidents during which significantly greater than <b>normal</b> <b>exposures</b> occur because of a leaky hose or value, wind conditions, a spill, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstance.|$|R
50|$|Long {{exposure}} time-lapse is {{less common}} {{because it is}} often difficult to properly expose film at such a long period, especially in daylight situations. A film frame that is exposed for 15 seconds will receive 750 times more light than its 1/50th of a second counterpart. (Thus it will be more than 9 stops over <b>normal</b> <b>exposure.)</b> A scientific grade neutral density filter can be used to compensate for the over-exposure.|$|E

DNA polymerase η may help bypass these lesions in an error-free manner; however, individuals with defective DNA repair function, such as sufferers of Xeroderma pigmentosum, are sensitive to sunlight and may be prone to skin cancer.|$|E
50|$|In {{photography}} reciprocity is {{the inverse}} relationship between the intensity and duration of light that determines the reaction of light-sensitive material. Within a <b>normal</b> <b>exposure</b> range for film stock, for example, the reciprocity law states that the film response {{will be determined by}} the total exposure, defined as intensity &times; time. Therefore, the same response (for example, the optical density of the developed film) can result from reducing duration and increasing light intensity, and vice versa.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Hypersensitive {{esophagus}} (HE) {{is defined}} by endoscopy-negative heartburn with a <b>normal</b> acid <b>exposure</b> time but positive symptom association probability (SAP) and/or symptom index (SI) on impedance-pH monitoring, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) responsiveness. Functional heartburn (FH) is distinguished by negative SAP/SI and PPI refractoriness. The clinical value of SAP and SI has been questioned. We aimed to investigate whether impairment of chemical clearance and of mucosal integrity, expressed by the postreflux swallow-induced peristaltic wave (PSPW) index and the mean nocturnal baseline impedance (MNBI), characterize HE independently of SAP and SI. METHODS: Impedance-pH tracings from PPI-responsive endoscopy-negative patients, 125 with nonerosive reflux disease and 108 with HE, distinguished by an abnormal and a <b>normal</b> acid <b>exposure</b> time, and from 70 patients with FH were retrospectively selected and blindly reviewed.

40|$|Lead {{in blood}} {{is a major}} concept in {{biomonitoring}} of exposure but investigations of its alternatives are scarce. The aim {{of the study was}} to describe different lead biomarkers' variances, day-to-day and between individuals, estimating their fraction of the total variance. Repeated sampling of whole blood, plasma and urine were conducted for 48 lead-exposed men and 20 individuals under <b>normal</b> environmental lead <b>exposure,</b> in total 603 measurements. For lead workers, the fraction of the total variance attributed to differences between individuals was 91 % for whole-blood lead (geometric mean 227 mg/l; geometric standard deviation (GSD) : 1. 55 mg/l); plasma 78 % (0. 57 mg/l; GSD: 1. 84 mg/l); density-adjusted urine 82 %; and unadjusted urine 75 % (23. 7 mg/l; GSD: 2. 48 mg/l). For the individuals under <b>normal</b> lead <b>exposure,</b> the corresponding fractions were 95 % of the total variance for whole blood (20. 7 mg/l; GSD: 8. 6 mg/l), 15 % for plasma (0. 09 mg/l; GSD: 0. 04 mg/l), 87 % for creatinine-adjusted urine and 34 % for unadjusted (10. 8 mg/l; GSD: 6. 7 mg/l). Lead concentration in whole blood is the biomarker with the best ability to discriminate between individuals with different mean concentration. Urinary and plasma lead also performed acceptably in lead workers, but at low exposures plasma lead was too imprecise. Urinary adjustments appear not to increase the between-individual fraction of the total variance among lead workers but among those with <b>normal</b> lead <b>exposure...</b>|$|R
50|$|Flash {{bracketing}} is {{a technique}} of working with electronic flash, especially when used as fill flash in combination with existing light, maintaining the overall amount of exposure.

Aluminium in food may be absorbed more than aluminium from water. It is classified as a non-carcinogen by the US Department of Health and Human Services.|$|E

In 96 patients (12. 5 % of total patients) with <b>normal</b> oesophageal <b>exposure</b> to acid, there was a statistically significant association between symptoms and reflux episodes. The symptom cluster of such patients was similar to that usually seen in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, but symptoms like belching, bloating, and nausea were common thus overlapping with the symptom pattern of functional dyspepsia. In these patients both the duration and the minimum pH of reflux episodes (either symptom related or asymptomatic) were significantly shorter and higher, respectively, when compared with those of patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. These results are consistent with the idea that oesophageal hypersensitivity to acid is the underlying pathophysiological feature of this syndrome...|$|R
