40|$|Despite {{the rise}} in {{importance}} {{of the private sector}} in the expansion of the use of groundwater in China and the potential implications this might have for production and poverty, little {{has been written about the}} effect of these phenomena on northern China's economy. In examining determinants of tubewell privatization and its impact on producers in northern China, data were collected using a community leader survey, carried out in 448 villages in six provinces in northern China. The results show that since 1990 collective ownership of tubewells has largely been replaced by private ownership. Increasing water scarcity, government grants and bank loans for tubewell investment and the declining investment capacity of China's local communities have led to the observed change in tubewell ownership patterns. By far, the most important positive effect on income appears to be due to the expansion of <b>newly</b> <b>irrigated</b> <b>area</b> that has been fueled by the rise of private tubewells. Many newly private tubewells also have begun to replace irrigation from surface water sources. While helping increase income and productivity, the rise of private tubewells also has contributed to the fall in groundwater levels...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a method for}} taking uncertainty into account when representing farmers ' production decisions. The main assumption is that farmers maximize their profit provided {{that the possibility of}} ruin is neg-ligible. The possibility of ruin is viewed as being closely related to Shackle's focus of loss. Results of a study incorporating the analytical apparatus de-veloped from this assumption are given here. In the particular case of farmers in southern France, the results lend support to the proposed pro-cedure, in spite of the arbitrariness involved in estimating some parameters, and particularly the foci of loss. I T IS well known that farmers ' decisions are made in an uncertain en-vironment. Unfortunately, {{one of the most difficult}} tasks in the analysis of production decisions is to go further than that and integrate the little knowledge which we have concerning producers ' behavior under uncer-tainty. There is far from unanimous agreement on the theoretical issues [14]. Besides, when one attempts to build a linear programming decision model, one is faced with another major difficulty: the expression of theore-tical considerations in a set of linear inequalities may be impossible with-out some approximation. Such an attempt was made in a study of vegetable production in a <b>newly</b> <b>irrigated</b> <b>area</b> of Provence in southern France. The problem there was to estimate producers ' response to changes in the price of water. For that, we used a linear programming decision model, as many others have done. ' But it rapidly became obvious that it was impossible to neglect farmers ' reactions to the extreme price uncertainty. The object of this article is to present the approach used to describe farmers ' behavior under uncertainty. First we review briefly the theoretical issues. Then we explain how we incorporated our analysis into a linear programming model. Theoretical Issue...|$|E

We have described the whole process by way of two consecutive stages. In the first, where the final demand is fixed, we use a demand-driven input-output model and we incorporate technical change through the reduction of the coefficients. In the second, the output of all sectors increases, with the increases in the vector of output being proportional to the forward linkages vector of the Agriculture sector. In this stage, our objective is to obtain a final demand vector that ensures that the agricultural value added increases to a prescribed value of v 1 *. Whilst the results demonstrate the positive effects of the transformation, they also reveal effects of a very different character in each sector. Thus, the Agriculture, Livestock and Agri-food industry sectors show significant increases in their gross outputs caused by the forward effects, whilst the Energy, Metal and Chemicals sectors reduce their outputs. These results shed light on the contradictory nature of the processes of development and technical change. Input-OUTPUT Model, Technical Change, Agricultural Linkages, Economic Impact,...|$|R

These areas were compared with the Indian National Statistical Data on <b>irrigated</b> <b>areas</b> reported by the: (a) Directorate of Economics and Statistics (DES) of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), and (b) Ministry of Water Resources (MoWR). A state-by-state comparison of remote sensing derived <b>irrigated</b> <b>areas</b> when compared with MoWR derived irrigation potential utilized (IPU), an equivalent of AIA, provided a high degree of correlation with R 2 values of: (a) 0. 79 with 10 -km, and (b) 0. 85 with MODIS 500 -m. However, the remote sensing derived <b>irrigated</b> <b>area</b> estimates for India were consistently higher than the <b>irrigated</b> <b>areas</b> reported by the national statistics. The remote sensing derived total area available for irrigation (TAAI), which does not consider intensity of irrigation, was 101 million hectares (Mha) using 10 -km and 113 Mha using 500 -m. The AIAs, which considers intensity of irrigation, was 132 Mha using 10 -km and 146 Mha using 500 -m. In contrast the IPU, an equivalent of AIAs, as reported by MoWR was 83 Mha. There are “large variations” in <b>irrigated</b> <b>area</b> statistics reported, even between two ministries (e. g., Directorate of Statistics of Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Water Resources) of the same national system.

Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data and time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were used to map <b>irrigated</b> agricultural <b>areas</b> as well as other land use/land cover (LULC) classes, for Ghana. Temporal variations in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) pattern obtained in the LULC class were used to identify <b>irrigated</b> and non-irrigated <b>areas.</b> First, the temporal variations in NDVI pattern were found to be more consistent in long-duration irrigated crops than with short-duration rainfed crops due to more assured water supply for <b>irrigated</b> <b>areas.</b> Second, surface water availability for <b>irrigated</b> <b>areas</b> is dependent on shallow dug-wells (on river banks) and dug-outs (in river bottoms) that affect the timing of crop sowing and growth stages, which was in turn reflected in the seasonal NDVI pattern. A decision tree approach using Landsat 30 m one time data fusion with MODIS 250 m time-series data was adopted to classify, group, and label classes. Finally, classes were tested and verified using ground truth data and national statistics. Fuzzy classification accuracy assessment for the irrigated classes varied between 67 and 93 %. An <b>irrigated</b> <b>area</b> derived from remote sensing (32, 421 ha) was 20 – 57 % higher than <b>irrigated</b> <b>areas</b> reported by Ghana’s Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA).

40|$|A {{demonstration}} of the utility of LANDSAT imagery for quickly and cheaply estimating <b>irrigated</b> land <b>area</b> was conducted in the Klamath River basin of Oregon. LANDSAT color composite images, at 1 : 250, 000 scale and acquired on two dates during the 1975 growing season, were interpreted. Irrigated lands were delineated manually, and the <b>irrigated</b> <b>area</b> was estimated, based on dot-grid sampling of the manually delineated lands. The image interpretation estimate of <b>irrigated</b> <b>area</b> was then adjusted by a comparison of interpretation results with ground data on 45 sample plots, each 2. 6 square kilometers in size. Two interpreters independently estimated the <b>irrigated</b> <b>area.</b> Their adjusted estimates were 115, 000 hectares and 108, 000 hectares respectively, with corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals of + or - 7, 880 hectares and + or - 14, 000 hectares...|$|R
