Site-directed mutagenesis is {{a powerful tool for}} achieving this goal, which is particularly suited for viruses because of their small genomes. Here, I discuss the evolutionary relevance of mutational fitness effects and critically review previous site-directed mutagenesis studies. The effects of single-nucleotide substitutions are standardized and compared for five RNA or single-stranded DNA viruses infecting bacteria, plants or animals. All viruses examined show very low tolerance to mutation when compared with cellular organisms. Moreover, for <b>non-lethal</b> mutations, the <b>mean</b> fitness reduction caused by single mutations is remarkably constant (0. 10 – 0. 13), whereas the fraction of lethals varies only modestly (0. 20 – 0. 41). Other summary statistics are provided. These generalizations about the distribution of mutational fitness effects can help us to better understand the evolution of RNA and single-stranded DNA viruses...|$|R

Players can hide behind a cover to evade enemy fire and prevent themselves being noticed.

A side effect of nicarbazin, a veterinary drug used to control coccidiosis in chickens, is decreased egg production and hatching. Exploiting this side effect, studies of nicarbazin for reducing the hatchability of eggs from Canada geese were conducted. An initial study in Coturnix quail verified reduction in hatchability in a species other than chickens. Because plasma nicarbazin was not routinely measured, a study in chickens was conducted to determine the relationship between plasma and egg nicarbazin. A comparative study in chickens, mallards, and Canada geese showed that nicarbazin absorption was lowest in geese. Studies in both penned and wild Canada geese showed that reduction in hatchability was possible but neither study used bait suitable for general field application. Bait development led to the OvoControl-G® (Innolytics LLC) bait, which resulted in reduction in hatchability of 51 % at treated sites compared to control sites in the field. Previous studies showed that nicarbazin is practically non-toxic and is environmentally friendly; timing and management of baiting will minimize non-target hazards. OvoControl-G® 2500 ppm nicarbazin bait is recommended for incorporation into a comprehensive management plan as a reproductive inhibitor for use in controlling resident Canada goose flock sizes...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{starvation}} and haemorrhage {{on the large}} bowel coliformflora with special reference to bacterial mucosal adherence and translocation by Carl-Gustaf Nettelbladt, MD Department of Surgery, Karolinska Hospital andInstitute, S- 171 76 Stockholm, Sweden Intestinal bacteria translocating to extraintestinal sites have been suggestedto {{play a role in}} the etiology of posttraumatic infections and multiple organ failure. In the present study, effects of haemorrhagic stress and /or starvation on the gutflora and bacterial translocation were studied in the rat. Hyperosmotic glucose infusion dunng haemorrhage in starved rats improved plasmarefill but did not reduce bacterial translocation. In this experiment four groupsof rats were subjected to haemorrhage. Two groups were given an i. v. infusion of hyperosmoticglucoseduring moderate (38 %bloodloss;n= 12) or severe (43 %bloodloss; n= 19) haemorrhage withoutreinfusion. Control groups received an i. v. infusion of saline during moderate (n= 12) or severe (n= 18) haemorrhage. No difference in bacterial translocation was observedbetween groups infused with glucose or saline. Starvation increased the number of coliform bacteria in caecal contents and inducedadherence of coliform bacteria to caecal epithelium. Rats in a control group (n= 19) were given their regular food. Six rats were starved for 24 hours and another 15 for 48 hours, with free access to water. Six rats underwent non-lethal haemorrhage(mean arterial pressure= 55 mm Hg). These animals were only allowed water until sampling 24 hours later. Twentyfour hours starvation increased the number of bacteria in caecalcontents 25 -fold (p< 0. 05). 48 hours starvation further increased the number (p< 0. 001) and induced a marked increase in bacteria adherent to caecal epithelium (p< 0. 001). In the haemorrhaged group similar changes were observed and bacterial translocationincreased (p< 0. 05) as compared to control rats. In order to characterise and compare coliform bacteria in caecal contents, oncaecal epithelium and in mesenteric Iymph nodes of 57 rats subjected to differentdegrees of stress a biochemical finger printing method was used. A total of 291 biochemicalphenotypes were found in caecal contents of all rats. Out of these, 108 were detectedon caecal epithelium and only 19 of these appeared in mesenteric Iymph nodes of thecorresponding rat. A total of 36 biochemical phenotypes were found in mesentericIymph nodes of all rats. Twentyone of these belonged to four common phenotypes. Theprevalence of these four phenotypes in mesenteric Iymph nodes did not differ significantly,while some of them had a low and some a high prevalence in caecal contents and oncaecal epithelium. The phenotypes found in mesenteric Iymph nodes were also, mostly,found adherent to the caecal epithelium of the corresponding rat. Orally inoculated translocating strains of E. coli were able to colonise the gut. Thus, inoculation increased bactenal translocation in rats lacking these strainsin their indigenous gut flora. Two groups of rats were inoculated with two translocatingstrains of E. coli. One group (n=l l) was starved for 24 hours and the other (n= 20) underwent <b>non-lethal</b> haemorrhage (<b>mean</b> arterial pressure= 50 mm Hg) and was starvedfor 24 hours thereafter. Two non-inoculated groups of similar size, subjected tothe same treatments served as controls. In the inoculated groups, bacterial translocationincreased both after 24 hours starvation (p< 0. 05) and haemorrhage (p< 0. 01) as compared to non-inoculated control rats. Ingestion of bulking fibre prevented mucosal adherence and translocation of atranslocating strain of E. coli. Four groups of rats were inoculated with a translocatingstrain of E coli. Animals in a control group (n= 8) were given their regular food. Eight rats were starved for 48 hours and eight given only bulking fibre for 48 hours. An additional group (n= 8) ingested bulking fibre only for 24 hours before and afterhaemorrhage (mean arterial pressure= 50 mm Hg). Bulking fibre for 48 hours reducedboth mucosal adherence (p< 0. 05) and translocation (p< 0. 001) of the inoculatedbacteria as compared to starved rats. It is concluded that haemorrhagic stress and starvation have marked effects onthe gut flora. Glucose infusion given during haemorrhage, previously shown to protectthe animal during circulatory shock, can not prevent bacterial translocation. Briefstarvation increases the number of coliform bacteria in caecum and induces bacterialmucosal adherence. Only a limited number of strains of coliform bacteria translocateafter stress. Adherence to caecal epithelium was associated with bacterial translocation. Inoculation with translocating strains of E. coli increases bacterial translocation. Bulking fibre prevents bacterial mucosal adherence and translocation. Detailed knowledgeof the gut E. coli flora is of great importance when interpreting results of studieson bactenal translocation.

Suppressing the IADS through <b>non-lethal</b> <b>means</b> would help accomplish this mission and, just as important after the Vietnam War, reduce casualties suffered by the strike group. For this reason, electronic jamming played a more prominent role in the operation than at Bekaa Valley and was carried out by both EF-111A Ravens and EA-6B Prowlers in the first ever joint US Air Force-Navy SEAD operation. For several reasons, F-4G Wild Weasels could not take part in El Dorado Canyon, requiring the use of the Navy's carrier-borne A-7E Corsair IIs and F/A-18 Hornets to attack Libyan SAM sites. Their lack of the Wild Weasel's specialized equipment required these fighters to fire their HARMs preemptively at Libyan SAM sites, a costly and wasteful method which nevertheless was effective due to the limited nature of the raid. For their part, the Libyans and their Soviet advisers had also learned lessons from the Bekaa Valley campaign: their IADS was constructed with multiple redundancies (including overlapping radar coverage and hardened landlines between defense sites) and a wider array of both Soviet and Western radar systems able to operate on multiple frequencies to avoid jamming. In the end US forces succeeded in suppressing the Libyan IADS and conducted their punitive strike with minimal casualties suffered.|$|E
