5|$|Horder {{prescribed}} her an antidepressant, a {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitor, {{a few days}} before her suicide. Knowing she was at risk alone with two young children, he says he visited her daily and made strenuous efforts to have her admitted to a hospital; when that failed, he arranged for a live-in nurse. Commentators have argued that because antidepressants may take up to three weeks to take effect, her prescription from Horder would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> full effect.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, Thompson brought another $600 million {{lawsuit against}} Cody Posey, Rockstar Games, Take-Two Interactive, and Sony Computer Entertainment. The lawsuit claimed that 14-year-old Posey {{played the game}} obsessively before murdering his father, stepmother, and stepsister on a ranch in Hondo, New Mexico. Posey's defense team argued that he was abused by his father and was taking Zoloft {{at the time of}} the killings. The suit alleged that the murders would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> place if Posey had not obsessively played Vice City. The case was {{dismissed}} in December 2007, as New Mexico held no jurisdiction over Sony or Take-Two.|$|E
5|$|San Martín made a {{new request}} for ships to Bowles, but {{received}} no answer. He moved again to Buenos Aires, to make a similar request. He arrived to Mendoza {{a few days after}} the execution of the Chileans Luis and Juan José Carrera, brothers of José Miguel Carrera. The specific initiative of those executions is controversial. Chilean historian Vicuña Mackenna indicts San Martín, while J. C. Raffo de la Reta blames O'Higgins instead. Manuel Rodríguez was also imprisoned and then killed in prison; this death may have been decided by the Lautaro lodge. San Martín could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> part in it, as he was already on the way to Buenos Aires.|$|E

5|$|Ferguson was a Jacobite. The {{records of}} the Spalding Club include a soldier's letter which {{indicates}} it is likely Ferguson was willing to offer refuge to Jacobites {{who participated in the}} Battle of Culloden. Jacobite rebels captured from throughout Scotland were taken to stand trial at Carlisle Castle in 1746. Ferguson and fellow advocate Alexander Lockhart argued in their defence. Prosecutors showed little mercy, calling for the rebels to be executed by hanging. Since the prosecution assumed anyone dressed in tartan was guilty, Ferguson and Lockhart had their servants dress in tartan and appear along with the other defendants. They called each other to the stand to testify as to the whereabouts of the servants and proved that, despite their tartan dress, the defendants could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> part in the rebellion. Many were found guilty, but the tactic succeeded, as some of the accused were acquitted, including the Laird of Dunfallandy, a kinsman of Ferguson.|$|E

25|$|The {{event was}} also {{seen as a}} way to expand the Speedweeks {{activities}} leading up to the Daytona 500.

Despite the fact that many, like Stalin, saw Trotsky's role in the October 1917 Russian revolution as central, Trotsky says that without Lenin and the Bolshevik party the October revolution of 1917 would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> place.|$|E

25|$|When {{asked about}} the working {{condition}} in sweatshops, proponents say that although wages and working conditions may appear inferior {{by the standards of}} developed nations, they are actually improvements over what the people in developing countries had before. It is said that if jobs in such factories did not improve their workers' standard of living, those workers would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the jobs when they appeared. It is also often pointed out that, unlike in the industrialized world, the sweatshops are not replacing high-paying jobs. Rather, sweatshops offer an improvement over subsistence farming and other back-breaking tasks, or even prostitution, trash picking, or starvation by unemployment.|$|E
25|$|In September 2006, Thompson brought another lawsuit, {{claiming}} that Cody Posey {{played the game}} obsessively before murdering his father Delbert Paul Posey, stepmother Tryone Schmid, and stepsister Marilea Schmid on a ranch in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The suit was filed {{on behalf of the}} victims' families. The suit alleged that were it not for his obsessive playing of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, the murders would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> place. Named in the suit were Cody Posey, Rockstar Games, Take-Two Interactive, and Sony. The suit asked for US$600 million in damages. During the criminal trial, Posey's defence team argued he was abused by his father, and tormented by his stepmother. Posey was also taking Zoloft {{at the time of the}} killings. The lawsuit was dismissed in December 2007.|$|E
25|$|An {{employee}} at Kautokeino {{claimed that he}} had observed allied aircraft in the no-fly zone {{on the day of}} the accident, but investigations showed that he was not working in Finnmark in March. Investigations of the logs at Kautokeino and Sørreisa showed no entries regarding any NATO air traffic. Captain Stein Aarbogh, working at Setermoen gunnery range, stated that {{on the day of the}} accident two Harriers were expected, but showed up several hours late, at around five o'clock in the afternoon. Aarbogh was certain of whom was range officer at the gunnery range on the day of the incident, but the commission could document that the person in question was working at Rygge Air Station on 11 March. Therefore, this incident could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> place on the day of the accident.|$|E

25|$|Alesia was an oppidum (fortified settlement) on a lofty hill, {{with two}} rivers on two {{different}} sides. Due to such strong defensive features, Caesar decided on a siege to force surrender by starvation. Considering that about 80,000 men were garrisoned in Alesia, together with the local civilian population, this would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> long. To guarantee a perfect blockade, Caesar ordered {{the construction of an}} encircling set of fortifications, a circumvallation, around Alesia. It was eleven Roman miles long (16km, each mile equivalent to around 1,000 left-foot steps, meaning one stepped with their right, then left) and had 24 redoubts (towers). While work was in progress, the Gauls carried out cavalry sallies to disrupt the construction. Caesar placed the legions in front of the camp in case of a sally by the infantry and got his Germanic allies to pursue the Gallic cavalry.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Forest {{reached their}} first FA Cup final under Clough against Tottenham Hotspur. With typical idiosyncrasy, Clough {{selected}} two players – Lee Glover and Ian Woan – {{with only a}} handful of league games behind them and left England international Steve Hodge on the substitutes' bench, preferring the young Roy Keane in the starting line up. After 90 minutes, with the score at 1–1, Clough did not go on to the pitch to encourage or advise his players before extra time, but remained on the bench. Tottenham won 2–1 with an own goal by Des Walker in extra time. Keane later claimed in his autobiography that he was injured and should <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> part in the game. The FA Cup was to be the only major domestic trophy which Clough did not win. In 1992, Forest reached another League Cup final, but lost 1–0 to Manchester United, but they did win a second Full Members Cup (the last edition of the competition) that season.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, the MMR vaccine was {{the subject}} of {{controversy}} after the publication in The Lancet of a 1998 paper by Andrew Wakefield and others reporting case histories of 12 children mostly with autism spectrum disorders with onset soon after administration of the vaccine. At a 1998 press conference, Wakefield suggested that giving children the vaccines in three separate doses would be safer than a single vaccination. This suggestion was not supported by the paper, and several subsequent peer-reviewed studies have failed to show any association between the vaccine and autism. It later emerged that Wakefield had received funding from litigants against vaccine manufacturers and that he had not informed colleagues or medical authorities of his conflict of interest; had this been known, publication in The Lancet would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> place in the way that it did. Wakefield has been heavily criticized on scientific grounds and for triggering a decline in vaccination rates (vaccination rates in the UK dropped to 80% in the years following the study), as well as on ethical grounds for the way the research was conducted. In 2004, the MMR-and-autism interpretation of the paper was formally retracted by 10 of Wakefield's 12 coauthors, and in 2010 The Lancets editors fully retracted the paper. Wakefield was struck off the UK medical register, with a statement identifying deliberate falsification in the research published in The Lancet, and is barred from practising medicine in the UK.|$|E
