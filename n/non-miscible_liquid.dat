In 1941 they published a paper entitled ‘A New Form of Chromatogram Employing Two Liquid Phases’ in the Biochemical Journal. Martin and Synge described how they had used columns of silica with water, used as the stationary phase, whilst a second, <b>non-miscible</b> <b>liquid,</b> flowed down the column. The second liquid was the organic solvent chloroform, and they separated acetamino-acids from protein hydrolysates. The components of the mixture separated were distributed between the two phases, depending on their relative affinity {{for each of the}} phases. As the components spread, they became separated from each other, and could be collected as they left the column. This is how ‘partition chromatography’ {{came to be known as}} a new form of chromatography due to the way that the sample ‘partitioned’ itself between the two liquid phases. Their paper was important because it laid the foundations of all the future work in the field of chromatography. In the first part of the paper they presented the first ever theory of chromatography that attempted to explain the concentration of the solute at any point in the column and also how the resolution of the column was affected by various factors including the column’s length. Looking at the figures they present for resolution in terms of Height Equivalent to a Theoretical Plate (HETP), underlying the importance of their work at that time. The HETP is a measure of the resolution that can be obtained by the column. There are several factors that affect HETP.|$|E

Physical examples {{are provided by}} polymer adsorption at the rough interface between two <b>non-miscible</b> <b>liquids,</b> or on a membrane. In a mean-field approach, {{we find that the}} self [...] avoiding chains undergo an adsorption transition, accompanied by a stiffening of the fluctuating surface. In particular, adsorption of polymers on a membrane induces a surface tension and leads to a strong suppression of roughness. Comment: REVTEX, 9 pages, no figure...|$|R
40|$|Contaminent-bearing {{leachates}} {{are frequently}} {{the cause of}} contamination of surface water and groundwater {{in the vicinity of}} waste sites. The remediation of such a contaminated site by means of encapsulation can be accelerated effectively by removal of the contaminated liquids from the disposal unit. The leachates usually consist preponderately of contaminant-bearing water. But they can contain also a considerable part of mineral oil, which is enriched with toxic organic substances. During the removal of <b>non-miscible</b> <b>liquids</b> water and oil, multiphase flows occur in the disposal unit which demand special dimensioning procedures for the removal systems. Beyond this, for reasons affecting work safety and environmental protection, special constructional requirements have to be applied to the removal system. Special dimensioning procedures for the removal systems were created and devices were developed for the removal of contaminant-bearing liquids. These devices were proved within a pilot test for the removal of oil out of former basins of liquid waste on the Georgswerder waste site in Hamburg. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract. The {{fractional}} {{volume of}} the reservoir sand shall {{be taken to the}} ground when the crude oil is brought up from the ground. With the deepening of the oil extraction the sand content of oil recovery is increasing. Although many measures have been used such as prevent sand, block sand and so on, the viscosity of heavy oil is big and the fractional of sand is carried into the crude oil gathering system inevitably, causing a series of problems at ground equipment, having a serious impact on the normal production and gathering of crude oil. The larger size of sand can be removed by the sedimentation and the smaller sand can be removed by hydrocyclone devices. Hydrocyclone is a separation plant used to separate non-uniform phase mixtures. It can be used to complete the liquid clarification and to wash particles, liquid degassing and grit removal, grading and classification of solid particles and the separation of two <b>non-miscible</b> <b>liquids</b> and others. Hydrocyclone separation technique is simple and convenient operation, high separation efficiency, no rotating units, small size and easy to realize automatic control. On the offshore platform，if the sand mixed with oil is discharged into sea unsatisfactory the standard, it will pollute the sea. It will cause a serious of marine pollution; this is a problem that should be solved quickly. This paper discusses the requirements for the design of the hydrocyclone desander equipment with compact structure, applicable to offshore drilling platforms，and carrying out CFD simulation, the results showing that the particle size of 75 of sand, grit removal efficiency above 90 %. 1...|$|R
