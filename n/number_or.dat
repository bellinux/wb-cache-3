5|$|Adjectives {{modify a}} noun by {{providing}} {{additional information about}} their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners. In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, {{and they do not}} agree in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases the slender boy, and many slender girls, the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the <b>number</b> <b>or</b> gender of the noun.|$|E
5|$|American Cocker Spaniels are {{susceptible}} {{to a variety of}} illnesses, particularly infections affecting their ears and, in some cases, their eyes. Although the <b>number</b> <b>or</b> percent of afflicted dogs is not known, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), glaucoma, and cataracts have been identified in some members of the breed. The American Spaniel Club recommends annual eye exams by a veterinary ophthalmologist for all dogs that are to be used for breeding. Autoimmune problems in Cockers have also been identified in an unknown <b>number</b> <b>or</b> percent of the breed, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Ear inflammations are common in drop-eared breeds of dog, including the American Cocker, and luxating patellas and hip dysplasia have been identified in some members of the breed.|$|E
50|$|The lowest <b>numbered</b> <b>or</b> {{lettered}} {{active element}} of the regiment normally has custody of the regimental properties. If, however, the lowest <b>numbered</b> <b>or</b> lettered active element is unable {{to care for the}} properties, they may be transferred to the next lowest <b>numbered</b> <b>or</b> lettered active element. If a <b>numbered</b> <b>or</b> lettered {{element of the}} regiment is activated lower than the one having custody of the regimental properties, the properties will not necessarily be transferred.|$|R

5|$|A group {{consists}} {{of a set of}} elements and a single operation which combines a first and a second element and returns a third. The operation must satisfy certain constraints for it to determine a group: It must be closed (when applied to any pair of elements of the associated set, the generated element must also be a member of that set), it must be associative, there must be an identity element (an element which, when combined with another element using the operation, results in the original element, such as adding zero to a <b>number</b> <b>or</b> multiplying it by one), and for every element there must be an inverse element.|$|E
5|$|ArtWalk {{takes place}} {{approximately}} every six weeks on Saturday evenings throughout the year. ArtWalk is organized by Galveston Arts Center, which releases an ArtWalk brochure featuring {{a map of}} participating venues as well as descriptions of shows and exhibits. Venues include GAC, Galveston Artist Residency and artist’s studios and galleries. Additionally, art is shown in “other walls”—for example MOD Coffeehouse or Mosquito Cafe—or outdoors at Art Market on Market Street. Musicians perform outdoors and at venues such as the Proletariat Gallery & Public House or Old Quarter Acoustic Cafe. While most ArtWalk events are concentrated downtown, there are a <b>number</b> <b>or</b> participants elsewhere on the island.|$|E
5|$|Claiming that {{corporations}} and government {{are planning to}} track every move of consumers and citizens with RFID as the latest step toward a 1984-like surveillance state, consumer privacy advocates, such as Katherine Albrecht and Liz McIntyre, have become Christian conspiracy theorists who believe spychips must be resisted because they argue that modern database and communications technologies, coupled with point of sale data-capture equipment and sophisticated ID and authentication systems, now {{make it possible to}} require a biometrically associated <b>number</b> <b>or</b> mark to make purchases. They fear that the ability to implement such a system closely resembles the Number of the Beast prophesied in the Book of Revelation.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} types of {{irreducible}} real representations of a finite group on a real vector space V, as the endomorphism ring commuting with the group action can be isomorphic to either the real <b>numbers,</b> <b>or</b> the complex <b>numbers,</b> <b>or</b> the quaternions.|$|R
5000|$|The {{suggestion}} that an infinity of objects characterized by certain <b>numbers</b> <b>or</b> properties implies the existence among them of objects with {{any combination of}} those <b>numbers</b> <b>or</b> characteristics ... is mistaken. An infinity does not imply at all that any arrangement is present or repeated. ... The assumption that all possible worlds are realized in an infinite universe {{is equivalent to the}} assertion that any infinite set of numbers contains all <b>numbers</b> (<b>or</b> at least all Gödel numbers of the defining sequences), which is obviously false.|$|R

5|$|Moltke and Goeben, {{improvements}} {{over the}} preceding Von der Tann, were ordered in 1908 and 1909, respectively. While their design {{was not as}} contentious as with the Von der Tann, there were still disagreements between Tirpitz and the General Navy Department over whether the main battery guns should be increased in <b>number</b> <b>or</b> caliber. Tirpitz favored the increase to ten guns, while the Navy Department preferred eight 30.5cm (12in) guns. It was eventually decided that ten 28cm guns would be mounted. In addition to the increased main battery, the two Moltke-class ships were slightly larger and better armored than Von der Tann.|$|E
5|$|Scholars face several {{problems}} {{in attempting to}} connect Khaba to royal names known from the Ramesside era (the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties). Unfortunately, these lists offer no clear consensus about the <b>number</b> <b>or</b> names of the kings of the 3rd dynasty. The Abydos king list gives Nebka, Djoser, Teti, Sedjes, and Neferkarê, while the Turin Canon offers Nebka, Djoser, Djoserteti, Hudjefa, and Huni. The kinglist of Saqqara lists Djoser, Djoserteti, Nebkarê, and Huni. The ancient historian Manetho gives nine names: Necheróphes, Tosorthrós, Týreis, Mesôchris, Sôÿphis, Tósertasis, Achês, Sêphuris, and Kerpherês. Egyptologist Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards, for example, identifies Khaba with the Ramesside cartouche name Teti.|$|E
5|$|The Rights of Men indicts monarchy and {{hereditary}} distinctions {{and promotes}} a republican ideology. Relying on 17th- and early 18th-century notions of republicanism, Wollstonecraft maintains that virtue {{is at the}} core of citizenship. However, her notion of virtue is more individualistic and moralistic than traditional Commonwealth ideology. The goals of Wollstonecraft's republicanism are the happiness and prosperity of the individual, not the greatest good for the greatest <b>number</b> <b>or</b> the greatest benefits for the propertied. While she emphasizes the benefits that will accrue to the individual under republicanism, she also maintains that reform can only be effected at a societal level. This marks a change from her earlier texts, such as Original Stories from Real Life (1788), in which the individual plays the primary role in social reform.|$|E

5|$|The {{generalized}} Euclidean algorithm {{requires a}} Euclidean function, i.e., a mapping f from R into {{the set of}} nonnegative integers such that, for any two nonzero elements a and b in R, there exist q and r in R such that a = qb + r and f(r) < f(b). An example of this mapping is the norm function used to order the Gaussian integers above. The function f can be {{the magnitude of the}} <b>number,</b> <b>or</b> the degree of a polynomial. The basic principle is that each step of the algorithm reduces f inexorably; hence, if f can be reduced only a finite number of times, the algorithm must stop in a finite number of steps. This principle relies heavily on the natural well-ordering of the non-negative integers; roughly speaking, this requires that every non-empty set of non-negative integers has a smallest member.|$|E
5|$|With the {{discovery}} of karyotype techniques in the 1950s, it became possible to identify abnormalities of chromosomal <b>number</b> <b>or</b> shape. In 1959, Jérôme Lejeune reported {{the discovery}} that Down syndrome resulted from an extra chromosome. However, Lejeune's claim to the discovery has been disputed, and in 2014, the Scientific Council of the French Federation of Human Genetics unanimously awarded its Grand Prize to his colleague Marthe Gautier {{for her role in}} this discovery. The discovery was in the laboratory of Raymond Turpin at the Hôpital Trousseau in Paris, France. Jérôme Lejeune and Marthe Gautier were both his students.|$|E
5|$|For 11 {{hours the}} German fleet sailed from Brest into the English Channel to the Dover Straits. By chance, a {{mechanic}} {{on the radar}} station at Fairlight, East Sussex had just finished repairing the equipment when he picked up 27 echos at 10:15 on 12 February, south of Cap Gris Nez. The information was relayed to Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsay, who ordered his Air Officer liaison to contact No. 11 Group RAF to ask for armed reconnaissance. Ramsay also warned No. 16 Group RAF and the FAA squadron operating out of RAF Manston that there were possible targets were in the Channel, despite not knowing the exact <b>number</b> <b>or</b> size of the enemy vessels. The performance of the radar was down to the jamming of the sets (Ballstöranlage) by two Heinkel He 111s which had been flying off the south coast from their airfield near Paris. The flights ceased at 09:00 when installations along the French coast had taken over. The detection by Fairlight {{was a piece of}} good fortune, the Germans had assumed it to be out of action. Ten Dornier Do 217s from III./KG 2 flew missions against Plymouth harbour and airfield, while 15 flew diversion missions to keep RAF fighters clear of the He 111s.|$|E
