5000|$|Wilhelm Anton [...] "Bill" [...] Leeb (born 21 September 1966, Vienna, Austria) is an Austrian-Canadian {{electronic}} {{musician and}} record producer. He {{is best known}} for being {{a founding member of the}} industrial music group Front Line Assembly. Additionally, Leeb is known for his work with groups such as <b>Noise</b> <b>Unit,</b> Delerium, Intermix, and Skinny Puppy, among others.|$|E
50|$|The {{band has}} seen several changes in line-up, with Bill Leeb {{being the only}} {{permanent}} member. The first album, Grinding into Emptiness, arose from the collaboration between Leeb and Marc Verhaeghen of Belgian industrial band Klinik. It was released in 1989 through Wax Trax! and Antler-Subway. The 1990 follow-up, Response Frequency, was the last release to feature Verhaeghen until 1996 and included Rhys Fulber who would remain with the band {{for the next three}} albums. Verhaeghen resumed his collaboration with <b>Noise</b> <b>Unit</b> for the 1996 album Drill which also featured members of German industrial band Haujobb. After an eight-year hiatus Leeb teamed with former Front Line Assembly member Chris Peterson in 2004 to release Voyeur in 2005. In 2014, Front Line Assembly announced on their official website that a new <b>Noise</b> <b>Unit</b> album is in the works and the line-up is the same as on Front Line Assembly album Echogenetic.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, Hypno5ive {{founded the}} {{historic}} Edge in Kendall, Florida and helped {{give rise to}} the fledgling South Beach dance club scene of the time while promoting EBM and industrial music. Club work since the late 80's has included: Club 1235, Club Nu’s Backdoor, Church, Kitchen Club, Club Beirut, Jonestown, Cameo, Red Room, Another World, Hell’s Kitchen, Institute, <b>Noise</b> <b>Unit,</b> Right Wing, The Catacombs at Power Studios, Thrashcan, DarkWave Club, Edge, and Marsbar.|$|E

50|$|Out of this {{environment}} also came Front Line Assembly, formed by former Skinny Puppy member Bill Leeb in 1986. Joined by Rhys Fulber (and later by Chris Peterson), FLA {{became one of}} the most commercially successful electro-industrial acts of the 1990s, and spawned a host of sideprojects, including (but not limited to) Conjure One, Pro-Tech, Synæsthesia, Will, Intermix, <b>Noise</b> <b>Unit,</b> Equinox, Cyberaktif, Mutual Mortuary, and the vastly successful Delerium, which began life as an ambient project.|$|E
50|$|Although it may {{be argued}} that Front Line Assembly has the largest cult {{following}} of all Leeb and associates projects, Delerium is undoubtedly the most financially successful. In addition to these two mainstays, related projects of the Leeb, Fulber, Peterson, Balch family include Equinox, Intermix, <b>Noise</b> <b>Unit,</b> Pro-Tech, and Synæsthesia, among others. In addition, in 2007 Leeb and Fulber collaborated with Leigh Nash under the name Fauxliage, also Rhys Fulber maintains his solo project Conjure One since his temporary exit from Delerium.|$|E

5000|$|Cryogenic Studio, Vol. 2 is a {{compilation}} album, released in 2000, and the follow-up to the 1998 album Cryogenic Studios.

The album title refers to the name of Cryogenic Studio in Vancouver that serves as headquarters studio for Front Line Assembly and related side projects.
