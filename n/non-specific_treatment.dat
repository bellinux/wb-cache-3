40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of Qingre Lishi Tuihuang therapy (QLTT) for acute icteric hepatitis B infection. Methods: Eight electronic databases were searched from inception to December 2016 with no language restrictions for reports of randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of QLTT treating acute icteric hepatitis B. Two researchers independently extracted detailed data and assessed methodological quality. Review Manager 5. 3. 0 software was {{used to analyze the}} data. Results: A total of 13 randomized controlled trials involving 2238 participants were included in this review. The methodological quality was generally poor. The results indicated that supplemented Yinchenhao decoction combined with <b>non-specific</b> <b>treatments</b> was more effective in improving the cure rate (risk ratio =  1. 80; 95 % CI 1. 21 – 2. 68) and reducing the serum levels of total bilirubin (mean difference = − 29. 74; 95 % CI − 31. 91 to − 27. 57) and aspartate aminotransferase. Other self-made prescriptions conforming to QLTT plus <b>non-specific</b> <b>treatments</b> had beneficial effect for acute icteric hepatitis B in curing this disease (risk ratio =  1. 48; 95 % CI 1. 27 – 1. 73), as well as for negative seroconversion of HBeAg (risk ratio =  1. 39; 95 % CI 1. 11 – 1. 74). Supplemented Yinchenhao decoction plus <b>non-specific</b> <b>treatments</b> was more effective than other self-made prescriptions conforming to QLTT in reducing serum total bilirubin level. Conclusion: Qingre Lishi Tuihuang therapy appears to improve effect based on <b>non-specific</b> <b>treatments</b> for the treatment of acute icteric hepatitis B. However, it is premature to draw confirmative conclusions, owing to the poor methodological quality and high clinical heterogeneity of the included trials.

40|$|Background: The {{conventional}} {{therapy for}} chronic hepatitis C {{is the combination}} of interferon-alpha and ribavirin. However, it has some adverse effects and does not response to some patients, {{and it is also}} very expensive. Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs for chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Search strategy: Electronic and manual searches were conducted and the search ended in July 2009. Inclusion criteria: We included randomized clinical trials testing Chinese herbal medicine vs placebo, <b>non-specific</b> <b>treatment,</b> antiviral treatment, or Chinese herbal medicine combined with antiviral treatment vs antiviral treatment alone. Data extraction and analysis: Selection of trials for inclusion, assessment of methodological quality, data extraction and data syntheses were conducted according to the protocol of a Cochrane systematic review by the authors. Results: Fifty-one randomized trials (involving 3 678 patients) with various methodological quality were included. The studies published in English had good quality, while studies published in Chinese were of poor quality. The pooled results showed that Chinese herbal medicine alone or in combination with antiviral treatment was generally better than <b>non-specific</b> <b>treatment,</b> or antiviral treatment alone, and herbal medicine appeared equal to antiviral treatment regarding comprehensive clinical effect in terms of symptoms, liver function and virological response. Regarding virological response including loss of serum hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA and anti-HCV antibodies, herbal medicine was better than <b>non-specific</b> <b>treatment,</b> equal to antiviral treatment, and the combination of herbs and antiviral treatment was better than antiviral treatment alone. Similar positive findings were found for liver function improvement. Adverse effects were observed among herbal injections and interferon treatment, and few cases had severe adverse effects. Conclusion: Herbal medicines included in this review have effects in improving symptoms, liver function, and loss of HCV markers in patients with chronic hepatitis C. However, for majority of the included trials were published in Chinese and had low quality, the promising effects from some herbs need to be confirmed in rigorous clinical trials, and the design and reporting of trials should follow international standards.

Randomized trials comparing extract of radix Sophorae flavescentis versus placebo, no intervention, <b>non-specific</b> <b>treatment,</b> other active medicines, or interferon for chronic hepatitis B were identified by electronic and manual searches. Trials of Sophorae herb plus other drugs versus other drugs alone were also included. No blinding and language limitations were applied. The methodological quality of trials was assessed by the Jadad scale plus allocation concealment. Meta-analysis was performed where data was available. Twenty-two randomized trials (n = 2409) were included. Methodological quality of the trials was generally low. The combined results showed that matrine (aqueous extract of Sophorae flavescentis) had antiviral activity, positive liver biochemical effects, and improved symptoms and signs compared with <b>non-specific</b> <b>treatment</b> and other herbal medicines. The combination of matrine and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), thymosin, or basic treatment showed better effects on viral and liver biochemical responses. The antiviral and biochemical responses {{were not significantly different}} between matrine and IFN-alpha. No serious adverse event was reported. Based on the review, Sophorae flavescentis extract (matrine) may have antiviral activity and positive effects on liver biochemistry in chronic hepatitis B.

40|$|Introduction: Components {{other than}} the active {{ingredients}} of treatment can have substantial effects on pain and disability. Such "non-specific" components include: the therapeutic relationship, the healthcare environment, incidental treatment characteristics, patients' beliefs, and practitioners' beliefs. This study aims to: identify the most powerful <b>non-specific</b> <b>treatment</b> components for low back pain (LBP); compare their effects on patient outcomes across orthodox (physiotherapy) and complementary (osteopathy, acupuncture) therapies; test which theoretically-derived mechanistic pathways explain the effects of non-specific components; and identify {{similarities and differences between}} the therapies on patient-practitioner interactions. Methods and analysis: This research comprises a prospective questionnaire-based cohort study with a nested mixed methods study. A minimum of 144 practitioners will be recruited from public and private sector settings (48 physiotherapists, 48 osteopaths, and 48 acupuncturists). Practitioners are asked to recruit 10 - 30 patients each, by handing out invitation packs to adult patients presenting with a new episode of LBP. The planned multilevel analysis requires a final sample size of 690 patients to detect correlations between predictors, hypothesised mediators, and the primary outcome (self-reported back-related disability on the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire). Practitioners and patients complete questionnaires measuring <b>non-specific</b> <b>treatment</b> components, mediators and outcomes at: baseline (Time 1 : after the first consultation for a new episode of LBP); during treatment (Time 2 : 2 -weeks post-baseline); and short-term outcome (Time 3 : 3 -months post-baseline). A randomly-selected sub-sample of participants in the questionnaire study will be invited {{to take part in a}} nested mixed methods study of patient-practitioner interactions. In the nested study, 63 consultations (21 /therapy) will be audio-recorded and analysed quantitatively and qualitatively, to identify treatment-enhancing communication practices. Ethics and dissemination: The protocol is approved by the host institution’s ethics committee and the NHS Health Research Authority Research Ethics Committee. Results will be disseminated via peer review journal articles, conferences, and a stakeholder workshop. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Background: Xiaochaihu Tang was a {{compound}} traditional Chinese herbal medicine recorded in ancient Chinese medical book Shanghanlun, {{and has been}} widely used for chronic liver diseases especially in Japan. Objective: To assess the beneficial effects and safety of Xiaochaihu Tang for chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Search strategy: Electronic and manual searches were conducted and the search ended in November 2009. Inclusion criteria: We included randomized clinical trials testing Xiaochaihu Tang against placebo, <b>non-specific</b> <b>treatment,</b> antivirals, or combined with antivirals against antivirals alone. Data extraction and analysis: Selection of trials for inclusion, assessment of methodological quality by Jadad score, data extraction and data syntheses were conducted according to the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group methods．Results: Sixteen randomized trials (involving 1 601 CHB patients) with various methodological quality were included. One trial published in English had good quality, while other trials published in Chinese were of poor quality. The pooled results showed that Xiaochaihu Tang combined with antiviral drugs was more effective in serum loss of hepatitis B viral markers and in improving liver function compared with antiviral drugs alone. Xiaochaihu Tang was not different from placebo in terms of viral clearance or improving liver function. However, Xiaochaihu Tang was superior to <b>non-specific</b> <b>treatment</b> in liver function improvement. There were no adverse effects reported in the trials regarding Xiaochaihu Tang, but adverse effects were reported in patients treated by interferon, and severe adverse effects occurred in few cases. Conclusion: Xiaochaihu Tang in this review appears {{to be effective in}} improving liver function and clearance of serum hepatitis B viral markers in patients with chronic hepatitis B.

A four-page questionnaire was sent to nationwide random samples of general practitioners (GP), internists and orthopaedists working in private practices. The response rate was 46 % (935 of 2018). 24 % of GPs, 44 % of internists and 57 % of orthopaedists had neither used pure placebos nor non-specific therapies in the previous 12 months. 11 % percent of GPs, 12 % of internists and 7 % of orthopaedists had exclusively used pure placebos; 30 %, 33 % and 26 %, respectively, had exclusively used non-specific therapies; 35 %, 12 % and 9 % had used both. Age, sex and agreement to the statement that physicians should harness placebo effects were not significantly associated with any pattern of use. Exclusive use of pure placebos was associated with being a GP, being an internist, and having unorthodox professional views. In addition to these three factors, a lower use of CAM therapies and a wish for having more time was associated with the exclusive use of non-specific therapies. Among physicians using both pure placebo and non-specific therapies, heterodox views were also somewhat more pronounced. However, associations were particularly strong for being a GP (Odds ratio 11. 6 (95 %CI 6. 41; 21. 3)) and having orthodox views (Odds ratio 0. 10 (95 %CI 0. 06; 0. 18)) among this group.

The aim {{of the study was}} the clinical evaluation of TF treatment and the incidence of positive tests before, during, and after therapy. Immunological data were matched using the Chi square test. 87 LMT were performed for each antigen dose and at the dilution of 1 / 50, 58. 9 % (33 / 56) tests were positive during non-treatment or <b>non-specific</b> TF <b>treatment.</b> On the contrary 83. 9 % (26 / 31) were positive during specific TF treatment (P < 0. 05).

Only during specific TF treatment was a significant increase of reactivity against the Candida antigen at the highest concentration noticed, when compared with the period of non specific treatment (P < 0. 01). Clinical observations were encouraging: all but one patient experienced significant improvement during treatment with specific TF. These data confirm that orally administered specific TF, extracted from induced lymphoblastoid cell-lines, increases the incidence of reactivity against Candida antigens in the LMT.

Nowadays, an evolution from a rather <b>non-specific</b> cytokine <b>treatment</b> to sophisticated targeted approaches in specific immunotherapy led to a re-launch of immunotherapy in clinical studies. Recent steps in the development of immunotherapy strategies are discussed in this review with a special focus on peptide vaccination which aims at a tumor targeting by specific T lymphocytes.

40|$|International audiencePain is {{a complex}} {{biological}} phenomenon that encompasses intricate neurophysiological, behavioural, psychosocial and affective components. Protracted or chronic pain alerts an individual to a possible pathological abnormality and {{is the main reason}} why patients visit a primary care physician. Despite the pervasiveness of chronic pain in the population, the effectiveness of current pharmacological therapies remains woefully inadequate and prolonged treatment often leads to the development of undesirable side-effects. Since the vast majority of chronic pain originates in a specific tissue or group of tissues, it may be advantageous to target pain control in the periphery and thereby circumvent the known risks associated with <b>non-specific</b> systemic <b>treatments.</b> This review spotlights a number of promising targets for peripheral pain control including the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of neuronal ion channels, the family of proteinase activated receptors (PARs), cannabinoids, and opioids.

40|$|Background: Challenging {{behavior}} {{interferes with}} the development of adaptive behavior and social relationships. For children with mild intellectual disabilities untreated aggressive behavior can lead to long-time institutionalisation, social isolation, physical restraint and over-use of medication. Mindfulness is a cognitive-behavioral therapy based on the awareness and non-judgemental acceptance by a clear, calm mind of one’s moment-to-moment experience, without either pursuing the experience or pushing it away. Recent literature suggests that Mindfulness can be effective in aggression regulation for (young) adults with a intellectual disability. Aim: In this study we examine the specific effects of Mindfullness training in levels of aggression in boys with a mild intellectual disability. Method: Four boys (8 to 11) with a mild intellectual disability participated in a multiple-baseline design on the effect of a mindfulness –based intervention to reduce severe acts of aggression. Each boy had shown uncontrolled verbal and physical aggression towards other group members or staff members. They participated in a four-phase study: a non-training baseline phase (A), a <b>non-specific</b> <b>treatment</b> phase (B), a specific Mindfulness treatment phase (C) and a non-training phase (D). Verbal and combined verbal/ physical acts per hour of the boys are recorded to determine the overall levels of aggression during the several phases. Results: Results from the Monte Carlo Permutation Test showed that for three of the four boys the mean aggression levels in treatment phases B and C had decreased significantly compared to phase A. In raw means all four of the boys show a positive change in aggression levels. There were, however, no significant differences in the levels of aggression between the two treatment phases. Conclusion: This study states a moderate optimistic effect, which is not due to the Mindfulness training, as already during the <b>non-specific</b> <b>treatment</b> phase B the aggression levels decreased significantly. Effects seem due to the attention effect (the Dodo Bird Verdict), instead of the specific training effect...|$|E
40|$|Background: Acupuncture is {{a popular}} form of {{alternative}} medicine. It has shown large non-specific effects, but which factors contribute to these effects is unclear. We therefore aimed to identify the psychosocial factors that could contribute to treatment outcomes in acupuncture. Methods: We interviewed a purposive sample of 35 individuals (29 women) who had used acupuncture for various conditions and to varying effect. We used framework analysis to summarise and interpret the data. Findings: Participants described intra-personal and inter-personal experiences before, during and after acupuncture needling that could contribute to treatment outcomes. Key themes in the analytic framework reflect individual physicality, cognition and emotion; social negotiation and support through the therapeutic relationship and close social networks; and societal and environmental influences.

40|$|Background: Low {{back pain}} causes more years lived with {{disability}} {{than any other}} health condition. The majority of low back pain is ‘non-specific,’ meaning it cannot {{be attributed to a}} pathological cause. Clinical guidelines therefore recommend <b>non-specific</b> <b>treatments</b> such as patient education and reassurance in primary care settings. However, there are few high-quality data on how to reassure patients effectively. Instead, patients with low back pain are receiving high numbers of inappropriate tests and treatments. Methods and Main Findings: This thesis is presented as a series of publications. In total there are seven pieces of original research on the topic of reassurance: one clinical commentary, one aetiological study, one prognostic model development and validation study, one systematic review, two study protocols, and one randomised trial. Three studies on the prognosis of low back pain {{led to the development of}} a clinical tool for predicting the onset of chronic low back pain. Based on the results in a large primary care cohort (n= 1619) using such a clinical tool has the potential to reduce inappropriate care for low back pain by 40 %. A systematic review found high-quality evidence (14 trials, n= 4872) that patient education can reduce emotional distress and subsequent health services use. A randomised trial in patients attending primary care for low back pain (n= 128) found evidence that professional attire does not influence the credibility of reassurance. The final randomised clinical trial of reassurance targeted to patients with a poor prognosis (n= 202) has completed recruitment. Follow-up rates to 6 -months in this trial have exceeded 95 %. Conclusions: High distress causes patients to consult more often for low back pain. To reduce distress, clinicians should provide structured education, which is effective in the short- and long-term. Dressing formally (in suit/tie) is not likely to improve the effects of reassurance. A new online tool developed out of the work in this thesis has the potential to improve the quality of reassurance and reduce the number of inappropriate interventions provided for low back pain. Targeted reassurance, including enhanced, prognosis-specific education, has the potential to optimise reassurance and possibly prevent chronic pain...|$|R
40|$|<b>Non-specific</b> {{responses}} to <b>treatment</b> (commonly known as placebo response) are pervasive when treating mental illness. Subjects treated with an active drug may respond {{in part due}} to non-specific aspects of the treatment, i. e, those not related to the chemical effect of the drug. To determine the extent a subject responds due to the chemical effect of a drug, one must disentangle the specific drug effect from the non-specific placebo effect. This paper presents a unique statistical model that allows for the separate prediction of a specific effect and non-specific effects in drug treated subjects. Data from a clinical trial comparing fluoxetine to a placebo for treating depression is used to illustrate this methodology. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech. {{degree in}} Pharmaceutical Sciences) [...] Tshwane University of Technology, 2009. Quality control {{procedures}} are vital in {{the pharmaceutical industry}} to guarantee the authenticity and quality of products. A major challenge in quality assurance of herbal material is the vast variation of active constituents in plants from the same species. As {{a result of this}} variation, the selection of only a few compounds as criteria for quality control is inadequate. Pelargonium (P.) sidoides is indigenous to South Africa and highly valued by traditional healers as a remedy to treat coughs, upper respiratory tract irritations and gastrointestinal conditions. An ethanolic extract of P. sidoides is used in the proprietary herbal tincture known as Umckaloabo®. The composition and concentration of polyphenols are parameters which determine the quality of this herbal medicine because it provides several therapeutic benefits in the <b>non-specific</b> medicinal <b>treatment</b> of infectious diseases. Despite the commercial development of P. sidoides very few studies have been conducted to document the full phytochemical range of variation for natural populations and no study has been published on the development of a fast accurate quality control method for the validation of raw material...|$|R
