5|$|Carrie Prejean started {{volunteering}} {{with the}} San Diego chapter of JC's Girls in 2008 and became Miss California USA the following year. At the Miss USA 2009 competition, Prejean became {{the subject of}} a controversy because of her response to a question about same-sex marriage. Scher said that the controversy would not affect Prejean's involvement with the organization and that the issue of same-sex marriage was <b>not</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> the group's activities. Prejean said that in volunteering with JC's Girls, she encountered pornographic models who, through exploitation and abuse, had developed very low self-esteem but who had regained a sense of their own dignity because of their interaction with JC's Girls volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Monsanto {{stated that}} he was {{infringing}} its patents because the soybeans he bought from the elevator were products that he purchased for use as seeds without a license from Monsanto; Bowman {{stated that he}} had not infringed due to patent exhaustion on the first sale of seed to whatever farmers had produced the crops that he bought from the elevator, on the grounds that for seed, all future generations are embodied in the first generation that was originally sold. Bowman had previously purchased and planted Monsanto seeds under a license agreement promising not to save seeds from the resulting crop, but that agreement was <b>not</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> his purchase of soybean seed from the grain elevator nor to the litigation. In 2007, Monsanto sued Bowman for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.|$|E

5|$|Submarine escape {{training}} led US Navy {{personnel to}} believe that Haldane's allowable supersaturation ratios for fast tissues were unnecessarily conservative, as calculated values indicated that supersaturation in trainees exceeded Haldane's limits, {{but they did not}} develop DCS. A large number (2143) of experimental dives were conducted over 3 years to derive allowable supersaturation ratios for a Haldanian 5 compartment model with compartment half-times of 5, 10, 20, 40 and 70 minutes. Values for critical supersaturation derived from this experimental work were different for each tissue compartment. Values for slow tissues (75 and 40-minute) were close to Haldane's findings, but considerably higher values were found for the fast tissues. These values were so high that the researchers concluded that the 5- and 10-minute tissues were <b>not</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> the development of DCS. Based on these conclusions, a set of tables was computed which omitted the 5- and 10-minute tissues.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately, many Acts {{passed by}} the Governor General during this period were <b>not</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> the Straits Settlements, and it was {{difficult}} to determine which were applicable. The situation was remedied by the passing of the Statute Law Revision Ordinance 1889 (No. 8 of 1889) (Ind.), which appointed commissioners to inquire into the matter and empowered them to publish a volume containing the text of any Indian Acts considered in force. Any Acts not included ceased to be applicable forthwith.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of whether claims under the 1934 Act were likewise exempt from the Federal Arbitration Act had first been raised in a 1974 case, Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Inc..

They had resurfaced in the previous term, in Justice Byron White's concurrence in Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd.

25|$|All {{people who}} present with red flags {{indicating}} a dangerous secondary headache should receive neuroimaging. The best form of neuroimaging for these headaches is controversial. Non-contrast computerized tomography (CT) scan {{is usually the}} first step in head imaging as it is readily available in Emergency Departments and hospitals and is cheaper than MRI. Non-contrast CT is best for identifying an acute head bleed. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is best for brain tumors and problems in the posterior fossa, or back of the brain. MRI is more sensitive for identifying intracranial problems, however it can pick up brain abnormalities that are <b>not</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> the person's headaches.|$|E
25|$|Haneef's legal {{advisers}} {{have challenged}} the Government {{to release the}} full record of the second police interview since they believe the public is entitled to judge for themselves whether the explanations given by Haneef in relation to these conversations are worthy of suspicion. His legal advisers have {{also pointed out that}} the material referred to by the Minister was available to the magistrate when she made her bail decision on 16 July and to the Director of Public Prosecutions when he decided to drop charges on 27 July. The Minister claims that these prior tests of the material are <b>not</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> his decision since, by the terms of the Act, he is not required to prove his suspicions beyond reasonable doubt. The Act also specifically exempts the Minister from the requirement to ensure his decisions comply with the principles of natural justice.|$|E
25|$|The {{natural law}} was {{inherently}} teleological, however, {{it is most}} assuredly not deontological. For Christians, natural law is how man manifests the divine image in his life. This mimicry of God's own life is impossible to accomplish except {{by means of the}} power of grace. Thus, whereas deontological systems merely require certain duties be performed, Christianity explicitly states that no one can, in fact, perform any duties if grace is lacking. For Christians, natural law flows not from divine commands, but from the fact that man is made in God's image, man is empowered by God's grace. Living the natural law is how man displays the gifts of life and grace, the gifts of all that is good. Consequences are in God's hands, consequences are generally not within man's control, thus in natural law, actions are judged by three things: (1) the person's intent, (2) the circumstances of the act and (3) the nature of the act. The apparent good or evil consequence resulting from the moral act is <b>not</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> the act itself. The specific content of the natural law is therefore determined by how each person's acts mirror God's internal life of love. Insofar as one lives the natural law, temporal satisfaction {{may or may not be}} attained, but salvation will be attained. The state, in being bound by the natural law, is conceived as an institution whose purpose is to assist in bringing its subjects to true happiness. True happiness derives from living in harmony with the mind of God as an image of the living God.|$|E

500|$|Hale's {{appeal was}} heard first in 1928. [...] It {{was based on}} {{improper}} procedure in admitting Burkhart's testimony as to the Smith bombing and again on the contention {{that the federal government}} did not have jurisdiction to try the case. [...] The Eighth Circuit Court denied the plea to the jurisdiction, noting that the Supreme Court had ruled on that very issue earlier in the case. [...] The court did find that the testimony as to the Smith bombing was <b>not</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> the Roan murder, was prejudicial against Hale, and required that the case be remanded for retrial. [...] Ramsey's appeal was likewise successful on the same grounds in 1929.|$|E
500|$|In pre-trial proceedings, the {{government}} stipulated that Noriega had received $322,000 from the U.S. Army and the CIA.

The district court held that information about the operations in which Noriega had played a part supposedly in return for payment from the U.S. was <b>not</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> his defense. It ruled that [...] "the tendency of such evidence to confuse the issues before the jury substantially outweighed any probative value it might have had."

500|$|Human {{rights are}} rights {{taken to be}} universal, of {{considerable}} importance, and relate to the individual and not collectively; among other things, they can grant freedoms, claims, immunities and powers. The European Convention on Human Rights was drawn up {{in the wake of}} the Second World War to uphold such rights. The United Kingdom ratified the European Convention on Human Rights in 1951, and accepted the right of individual petition to the European Court of Human Rights, Strasbourg, in 1966. The Human Rights Act 1998 made most Convention rights directly enforceable in a British court for the first time. Excluded are Articles 1 and 13, which the government argued were fulfilled by the Act itself, and therefore were <b>not</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> rights enforced under it. The Human Rights Act has had a considerable effect on British law, and remains an Act of [...] "fundamental constitutional importance".|$|E
500|$|The Tenth Circuit Court {{affirmed the}} {{decision}} of the district court. [...] First the court noted that the reservation boundaries were <b>not</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> the case, the issue instead being tribal immunity from state jurisdiction. [...] The court noted the prior Supreme Court decision in Okla. Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band, Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Okla. and stated that [...] "It appears as though the State of Oklahoma persists in fighting a battle it has already lost." [...] Since Oklahoma could provide no Congressional authority for collecting taxes from Sac and Fox tribal members {{it was clear that the}} state had exceeded its authority. [...] On the income tax for non-tribal employees, the Sac and Fox Nation asserted that the Commerce Clause and treaty language granted it exclusive taxing authority on tribal land. [...] The appellate court was not persuaded and ruled that the state could impose an income tax on non-tribal members.|$|E
500|$|Ron Noades, who {{purchased}} {{the club for}} £2,782 in 1976, came to see Plough Lane as a potential limitation by 1979. He surmised that it could only attract {{a relatively small number}} of fans because of its location, close to large areas of sparsely populated parkland. Noades's interest was piqued by the site the Milton Keynes Development Corporation had earmarked for a stadium next to the town's still-under-construction Central railway station. [...] "They were very keen to get a Football League club, effectively a franchise if you like, into Milton Keynes to take up that site," [...] Noades said in a 2001 interview. Planning to move Wimbledon there by amalgamating with an established Milton Keynes club, Noades purchased debt-ridden Southern League club Milton Keynes City (MK City; formerly Bletchley Town) for £1. [...] He and three other Wimbledon directors—Jimmy Rose, Bernie Coleman and Sam Hammam—were promptly voted onto MK City's board [...] "in an advisory capacity". This was a separate personal investment by the four directors, Noades said at the time, and <b>not</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> a move, though he also spoke at length about the superior long-term promise of the Milton Keynes location.|$|E
