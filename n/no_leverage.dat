2500|$|Farmland's founder, Howard A. Cowden, {{was born}} in 1893 on a southwestern Missouri farm settled by his grandfather. [...] Unlike other farms in his native Polk County, which {{averaged}} less than 100 acres in size, the Cowden farm at 500 acres {{was one of the}} largest. [...] Cowden believed strongly that farmers were at an economic disadvantage in the marketplace: they faced high interest rates on mortgages, paid high transportation costs, and had virtually <b>no</b> <b>leverage</b> in the pricing of their commodities. [...] He believed that farmers were faced with a [...] "take-it-or-leave-it" [...] proposition. [...] Cowden became active in the organization of agricultural cooperatives and in 1929 formed a new firm, Union Oil Company, which he organized as a cooperative under Missouri statutes. [...] Since Union Oil was intended as a regional enterprise, Cowden elected to establish headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri. [...] By the end of its first year of operation, Union Oil served 22 local cooperatives and was supplied by Kanotex Corporation. [...] Union Oil became the first cooperative in the country to run an oil-compounding plant. [...] With the organization becoming involved {{in a wide range of}} products, it was decided in February 1935 to change the name to [...] "Consumers Cooperative Association" [...] (CCA). [...] CCA had 259 local cooperatives as members and was generating more than $2 million in annual revenues. [...] CCA established a grocery division in 1935 and soon the CO-OP label was applied to over 200 products. [...] To support its petroleum business, CCA built a refinery in Phillipsburg, Kansas. [...] When it became operational in 1939, the facility greatly increased the organization's income and led to a period of prosperity during the 1940s. [...] CCA became involved in a variety of other areas, including the production of flour and feed, the manufacture of household and electrical appliances, and the development of insurance and finance associations. [...] Of particular importance was the feed program, which in its first year generated more revenue than the grocery business did in its tenth year. [...] Another highly profitable business for CAA was fertilizer, which farmers began to use at an accelerated rate. [...] By 1958, CCA topped $100 million in annual revenues, ranked 327th among the Fortune 500, and was one of the largest cooperatives in America. [...] In many ways it was considered an industrial powerhouse, controlling a wide range of assets: oil wells, pipelines, refineries, grease and paint factories, feed mills, fertilizer works, warehouses, and a fleet of trucks. [...] Petroleum products continued to dominate the cooperative's business, accounting for 70 percent of revenues, but that percentage would dip below 50 percent over the next few years as fertilizer became an increasingly more important revenue stream. [...] The emphasis of CCA turned to the farm supply and service field, making the use of the word [...] "consumer" [...] in its title less appropriate. [...] The organization also faced mounting pressure to better serve farmers by engaging in the marketing of agricultural products, an area which CCA had intentionally avoided. [...] In 1958, the CCA Board agreed to become involved in marketing as opportunities might arise. [...] A year later the cooperative purchased the Crawford County Packing Company in Denison, Iowa, and entered the pork processing business, ultimately acquiring food manufacturing facilities throughout the Midwest. [...] During the course of developing its food processing capability, the cooperative sought to improve operating efficiencies, marketing strategies and the relationship with facility employees.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} subnational climate {{policies in}} Belgium {{as a crucial}} case of multi-level policy-making in Europe. In Belgian federalism, the subnational governments have a large autonomy to conduct their own climate policies, while the scope to act {{at the federal level}} is very limited. Moreover, the federal system had produced complex and ineffective coordination patterns, where the federal and the subnational governments each have the possibility to block agreements, e. g. on the intra-Belgian burden sharing of the EU 20 - 20 - 20 targets. The paper demonstrates that, despite their large autonomy, the climate policies of Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels have shown only modest ambitions so far and that they lack a long-term vision. Because of an ongoing political stalemate in Belgium, the subnational governments lack the targets that should guide their new climate policy plans. An additional difficulty is the increasingly strong political divide between conservative and progressive political parties on climate change. The divide opposes Flanders, with a conservative Environment minister, to the other Belgian governments, where the Environment portfolio is held by green or socialist ministers. Since the issue is politically sensitive, it hijacks the mechanisms of intergovernmental cooperation and even prevents Belgium from taking a position in European and global decision-making bodies. It is concluded that the Belgian subnational governments, although they have multiple assets for bottom-up innovation, are no laboratories of experimentation. A partial reason is the complex multi-level architecture and its slow decision-making procedures. But it is also due to an overall lack of political will. The latter is reinforced by the particular institutional setting, which entails <b>no</b> <b>leverages</b> to force the subnational governments into a more ambitious role and thus impedes innovation. As a result, Belgian climate policies uphold a status quo. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} the first attempt to {{evaluate}} the interest rate sensitivity of return and volatility of the Dow Jones Islamic Market Indices.
