40|$|The Perturbed Chain Statistical Association Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) {{is used to}} {{investigate}} the solubility of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) in several methylimidazolium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ionic liquids (ILs) or [Cnmim][NTf 2] where n = 2; 4; 6 and 8. The pure component parameters of the studied ILs are estimated by fitting to experimental density data and binary solubility data of acid gases in ILs reported in literature. Two strategies are examined to model the studied ILs. In the first strategy, ILs are modelled as neutral molecules. As for the second strategy, ILs are modelled as charged ions: imidazolium cation [Cnmim]+ and bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide anion [NTf 2]-. For each strategy, four different self association schemes are examined. The schemes are: <b>non</b> <b>associating,</b> 2 -sites, 3 -sites and 4 -sites scheme. Results indicated that, {{the inclusion of the}} association term improves the solubility fit. The 4 -sites association scheme with two donors and two acceptors provided the best results for almost all investigated acid gases-IL binary systems with AARD% of (7. 48 %– 2. 76 %) for H 2 S-ILs systems and (4. 98 %– 1. 45 %) for CO 2 -IL systems. The solubility of acid gases in the ILs is successfully represented using PC-SAFT without the need for any binary interaction parameters if the proper association scheme is selected. The inclusion of the electrolyte term in the second strategy improves the predictive capability of the model by allowing for the examination of the effect of using different cation-anion combinations...|$|R

40|$|In {{this report}} (prepared in {{collaboration}} with Prof. Jeong Whan Yoon, Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia) a research {{effort was made to}} develop a <b>non</b> <b>associated</b> flow rule for zirconium. Since Zr is a hexagonally close packed (hcp) material, it is impossible to describe its plastic response under arbitrary loading conditions with any associated flow rule (e. g. von Mises). As a result of strong tension compression asymmetry of the yield stress and anisotropy, zirconium displays plastic behavior that requires a more sophisticated approach. Consequently, a new general asymmetric yield function has been developed which accommodates mathematically the four directional anisotropies along 0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees, and biaxial, under tension and compression. Stress anisotropy has been completely decoupled from the r value by using <b>non</b> <b>associated</b> flow plasticity, where yield function and plastic potential have been treated separately to take care of stress and r value directionalities, respectively. This theoretical development has been verified using Zr alloys at room temperature as an example as these materials have very strong SD (Strength Differential) effect. The proposed yield function reasonably well models the evolution of yield surfaces for a zirconium clock rolled plate during in plane and through thickness compression. It has been found that this function can predict both tension and compression asymmetry mathematically without any numerical tolerance and shows the significant improvement compared to any reported functions. Finally, in the end of the report, a program of further research is outlined aimed at constructing tensorial relationships for the temperature and fluence dependent creep surfaces for Zr, Zircaloy 2, and Zircaloy 4...|$|E
