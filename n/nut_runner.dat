40|$|Control laws (in some optimal sense) {{are being}} {{developed}} for the gripper/nut runner end effector. Control laws for the gripper and <b>nut</b> <b>runner</b> portions of the end effector may be developed independently since these two systems are decoupled. A hybrid force/position controller {{will be used for}} both the gripper and <b>nut</b> <b>runner.</b> The development of the gripper controller is explained. Sensory data available to the controller is obtained from an array of strain gages as well as a linear potentiometer. Applying well known optimal control theoretic principles, the control which minimizes the transition time between positions is obtained. In addition, a robust force control scheme is developed to contend with the strain gage drift caused by extreme temperature variations encountered in space...|$|E

To reduce this time further, it is proposed to use six spindle <b>nut</b> <b>runner</b> and also to automate tyre loading process. This will need additional investment and approval. As of now process reached to saturation level, additional investment may not prove to be competitive in the market because as investment increases, cost of the product also increases. There can be tradeoff {{between the number of}} vehicles produced and additional investment cost. Therefore, present state can be considered as an optimal solution for the said plant.|$|E
5000|$|A {{widespread}} {{application of}} pneumatic motors is in hand-held tools, impact wrenches, pulse tools, screwdrivers, <b>nut</b> <b>runners,</b> drills, grinders, sanders and so on. Pneumatic motors {{are also used}} stationary {{in a wide range}} of industrial applications. Though overall energy efficiency of pneumatics tools is low and they require access to a compressed-air source, there are several advantages over electric tools. They offer greater power density (a smaller pneumatic motor can provide the same amount of power as a larger electric motor), do not require an auxiliary speed controller (adding to its compactness), generate less heat, and can be used in more volatile atmospheres as they do not require electric power [...] and do not create sparks. They can be loaded to stop with full torque without damages.|$|R
30|$|As {{the designs}} for timber {{structures}} grow larger and larger, contractors are increasingly using lag screw connectors in their projects [1]. The benefits of lag screw joints include less loosening and slippage when a load is first applied than bolted timber joints; however, they also require more caution, making construction management {{an important consideration}} [2]. For example, screwing in a lag screw without first drilling a pilot hole can cause the timber member to crack, or driven in using a hammer. In addition, overtightening beyond a lag screw’s pullout strength risks damaging the joint, weakening it compared with its original performance. One potential solution to prevent the latter scenario is to apply a torque control method to provide suitable torque {{by means of a}} torque wrench or other tool. However, no one has yet developed a torque control method for lag screw timber joints: contractors today rely on their own experiences and intuition when tightening lag screw connectors, an arbitrary judgment. Torque control methods involve different tightening speeds, because tools such as torque wrenches and <b>nut</b> <b>runners</b> are turned manually to provide torque. For metallic bolted joints, differences in tightening speed are known to result in different coefficients of friction and torque, important factors that determine the feasibility of a given torque control method as well as in variation in axial force (“clamp force” below) [3]. In a previous study on bolted timber joints, we discovered that the torque coefficient decreases at higher tightening speeds and were able to reduce fluctuations in the clamp force by setting the tightening speed to 20  rpm [4]. For lag screw timber joints, however, {{there appears to be no}} research that has clarified the effects of tightening speed on the torque coefficient. This point needs to be clarified, since construction management is more important for lag screw timber joints than for bolt joints, and because no torque control method has been established for lag screw timber joints. In a previous study, we developed a high damping shear wall in which timber members were joined together, or to steel plates, with lag screws or bolts. Tightening generates a clamp force, which in turn generates a frictional resistance force between two timber members, or between one and a steel plate [5]. Our later research investigated how to apply torque control methods to control this clamp force, a serious issue that must be addressed to control the expression of this frictional resistance force [6, 7]. One of the resulting challenges we faced in developing our high damping shear wall was how to determine the effects of lag screw tightening speed on the joint’s torque coefficient.|$|R
50|$|The {{millstones}} themselves turn {{at around}} 120 rpm. They are laid {{one on top}} of the other. The bottom stone, called the bed, is fixed to the floor, while the top stone, the runner, is mounted on a separate spindle, driven by the main shaft. A wheel called the stone <b>nut</b> connects the <b>runner's</b> spindle to the main shaft, and this can be moved out of the way to disconnect the stone and stop it turning, leaving the main shaft turning to drive other machinery. This might include driving a mechanical sieve to refine the flour, or turning a wooden drum to wind up a chain used to hoist sacks of grain to the top of the mill house. The distance between the stones can be varied to produce the grade of flour required; moving the stones closer together produces finer flour.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to find and map {{correlations}} between different parameters and the resulting rotational displacement of a component being bolted. The background to this thesis emanates from a problem encountered at Volvo where components tend to rotate as they are bolted to the car body. One component in which this is visible is the car hood, where about 50 % of the hoods on a specific car model have to be adjusted post-assembly. The project was therefore mostly conducted at Volvo Cars in Torslanda. During the work a number of experiments were carried out using both generic components as well as components specific to a Volvo vehicle. A finite element simulation model was developed, yet only using a static simulation. It can however {{be used as a}} starting point for the development of a dynamic model. One of the projects most important result is the effect of SEMS bolts, that is, a bolt with a pre-assembled washer. When using a washer, the rotation and the exerted torque of the component are both reduced, on an average, by a factor of 2. 2 at a minimum. This factor was consistent across most component materials. However, the rotation was 18 times greater of components made from aluminium when no washer was used. Our studies show that the relation between the transferred torque between bolt and component and the final rotation of the component seem to be linear. Another result observed is the effect of oil applied between component, bolt, and the underlying surface. When oil is applied between bolt and component the transferred torque is reduced by a factor of two. On the other hand, when oil is applied between component and the underlying surface the rotation of the component is increased by a factor greater than five. The optimum angular velocity of bolting was found to be between 200 - 220 RPM. At lower angular velocities, the <b>nut</b> <b>runner</b> has a longer period of time to make the component rotate before it is locked into place by the axial tension. At higher speeds, it becomes difficult to get accurate readings because the <b>nut</b> <b>runner</b> jumps out of place. During the studies, a wide distribution of the results was observed. Additional iterations would most certainly have produced more reliable results and, thus, a better understanding, but time, material availability, as well as access to the tools were limited...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis was {{performed}} at Scania CV AB in Södertälje at the engine development department, NMKA and at Scania Latin America in Sao Paolo, Brazil. Scania {{is a global}} company with operations in Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa and Australia. Scania is the world’s third largest manufacturer for heavy trucks and heavy bus segment. The constant development of new design solutions demands more stable mounting in Scanias production. Assemblies with new screw joints with different parameters affect {{the value of the}} clamping force for the joint and consequently the final product. It is critical that the screw joint has the right clamping force to assure that it fulfils its purpose. Large deviations can result in total loss of clamping force and engine breakdown. The purpose with this master thesis was to find the most important factors that affect the clamping force and form the basis of how different screw joints should be handled. Knowledge about Scania screw joints were collected by working in the production, observing drawings, a thorough literature study and by interviewing representatives from different departments. The problems regarding screw joints were found to be rather different at the departments and the problems had been an issue {{for a longer period of}} time. The mapping of screw joints resulted in a number of interesting screw joints with different kinds of problems. A discussion about the interesting screw joints was held in order to select joints to take a closer look at. By focusing on area of interest, area of responsibility and resources, five screw joints were selected, rocker arm shaft, main bearing cap, connecting rod and the oil sump in both aluminum and steel. The chosen screw joints represented specific types of screw joints on which the chosen parameters were tested. The important parameters that were tested are driver speed, friction and settlement. The equipment that was used throughout the work was the Ultrasonic, which measures the length of a screw with ultrasound. The authors feel that the equipment has given reliable results and that it has been easy and convenient to use during the tests since time consuming strain gages were avoided. The test results shows that the speed of the <b>nut</b> <b>runner</b> has a great influence on the clamping force and torque. Depending on the <b>nut</b> <b>runner</b> and which kind of screw joint that is examined the clamping force and torque varies. The friction affects the result of the tightening substantially, especially when tightening by torque. If torque and angle tightening is used it is an advantage to keep the initial torque as low as possible but high enough to keep the surfaces tight together before applying the angle. The test results regarding settlement show that the settlement is extremely dependent on the ingoing parts in the screw joint. Parameters such as screw and clamped parts affect both the tightening procedure and degree of settlement. The authors recommendations are that a decision has to be made about what information is important for each department. Furthermore, as the tightening procedure is really important for the final clamping force it is advisable to decide which department that is responsible of making the correct tightening parameters of a specific screw joint in the production. Hopefully this master thesis has woken an interest which in the future can make a difference for an even more stable production and in the end an even better quality at Scania CV AB.
