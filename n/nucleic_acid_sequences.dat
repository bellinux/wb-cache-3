5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences</b> from the {{internal transcribed spacer}} and elongation factor EF-1α regions suggests that the genus Morchella {{can be divided into}} three lineages. M.rufobrunnea belongs to a lineage that is basal to the esculenta clade ("yellow morels"), and the elata clade ("black morels"). This phylogenetic placement implies that it has existed in its current form since the Cretaceous era (roughly 145 to 66 million years ago), and all known morel species evolved from a similar ancestor. M.rufobrunnea is genetically closer to the yellow morels than the black morels. M.anatolica, described from Turkey in 2012, is a closely related sister species.|$|E

25|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} from genetics that all organisms {{have a common}} ancestor. For example, every living cell makes use of nucleic acids as its genetic material, and uses the same twenty amino acids as the building blocks for proteins. All organisms use the same genetic code (with some extremely rare and minor deviations) to translate <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences</b> into proteins. The universality of these traits strongly suggests common ancestry, because the selection {{of many of these}} traits seems arbitrary. Horizontal gene transfer makes it more difficult to study the last universal ancestor. However, the universal use of the same genetic code, same nucleotides, and same amino acids makes the existence of such an ancestor overwhelmingly likely.|$|E
2500|$|Both DNA microarrays [...] and {{quantitative}} PCR exploit the preferential binding or [...] "base pairing" [...] of complementary <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences,</b> {{and both are}} used in gene expression profiling, often in a serial fashion. While high throughput DNA microarrays lack the quantitative accuracy of qPCR, it takes {{about the same time}} to measure the gene expression of a few dozen genes via qPCR as it would to measure an entire genome using DNA microarrays. So it often makes sense to perform semi-quantitative DNA microarray analysis experiments to identify candidate genes, then perform qPCR on some of the most interesting candidate genes to validate the microarray results. Other experiments, such as a Western blot of some of the protein products of differentially expressed genes, make conclusions based on the expression profile more persuasive, since the mRNA levels do not necessarily correlate to the amount of expressed protein.|$|E

2500|$|A DNA {{microarray}} (also {{commonly known}} as DNA chip or biochip) {{is a collection of}} microscopic DNA spots attached to a solid surface. Scientists use DNA microarrays to measure the expression levels of large numbers of genes simultaneously or to genotype multiple regions of a genome. Each DNA spot contains picomoles (10−12 moles) of a specific DNA sequence, known as probes (or reporters or oligos). These can be a short section of a gene or other DNA element that are used to hybridize a cDNA or cRNA (also called anti-sense RNA) [...] sample (called target) under high-stringency conditions. Probe-target hybridization is usually detected and quantified by detection of fluorophore-, silver-, or chemiluminescence-labeled targets to determine relative abundance of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences</b> in the target. The original nucleic acid arrays were macro arrays approximately 9cm × 12cm and the first computerized image based analysis was published in 1981.|$|E
2500|$|The core {{principle}} behind microarrays is hybridization {{between two}} DNA strands, {{the property of}} complementary <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences</b> to specifically pair with each other by forming hydrogen bonds between complementary nucleotide base pairs. A high number of complementary base pairs in a nucleotide sequence means tighter non-covalent bonding between the two strands. After washing off non-specific bonding sequences, only strongly paired strands will remain hybridized. Fluorescently labeled target sequences that bind to a probe sequence generate a signal {{that depends on the}} hybridization conditions (such as temperature), and washing after hybridization. Total strength of the signal, from a spot (feature), depends upon the amount of target sample binding to the probes present on that spot. Microarrays use relative quantitation in which the intensity of a feature is compared to the intensity of the same feature under a different condition, [...] and the identity of the feature is known by its position.|$|E
2500|$|George Gamow {{established}} {{a group of}} scientists interested in the role of RNA as an intermediary between DNA as the genetic storage molecule in the nucleus of cells and the synthesis of proteins in the cytoplasm (the RNA Tie Club). It was clear to Crick that {{there had to be a}} code by which a short sequence of nucleotides would specify a particular amino acid in a newly synthesized protein. In 1956, Crick wrote an informal paper about the genetic coding problem for the small group of scientists in Gamow's RNA group. In this article, Crick reviewed the evidence supporting the idea that there was a common set of about 20 amino acids used to synthesize proteins. Crick proposed that there was a corresponding set of small [...] "adaptor molecules" [...] that would hydrogen bond to short sequences of a nucleic acid, and also link to one of the amino acids. He also explored the many theoretical possibilities by which short <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences</b> might code for the 20 amino acids.|$|E

2500|$|One of Dayhoff's most {{important}} contributions to bioinformatics was her Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, a book reporting all known protein sequences (totaling 65) that she published in 1965. It was subsequently republished in several editions. [...] This {{led to the}} Protein Information Resource database of protein sequences, the first online database system that could be accessed by telephone line and available for interrogation by remote computers. The book has since been cited nearly 4,500 times. It and the parallel effort by Walter Goad {{which led to the}} GenBank database of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences</b> are the twin origins of the modern databases of molecular sequences. [...] The Atlas was organized by gene families, and she is regarded as a pioneer in their recognition. Frederick Sanger's determination of the first complete amino acid sequence of a protein (insulin) in 1955, led a number of researchers to sequence various proteins from different species. In the early 1960s, a theory was developed that small differences between homologous protein sequences (sequences with a high likelihood of common ancestry) could indicate the process and rate of evolutionary change on the molecular level. The notion that such molecular analysis could help scientists decode evolutionary patterns in organisms was formalized in the published papers of Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling in 1962 and 1965.|$|E
