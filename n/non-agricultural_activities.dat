But the type of diver-sification activity encouraged, {{as well as their}} scale, appears to be very different across the EU. Therefore the analysis of spatial diversification of other gainful activity of farm households in EU countries is the main purpose of this paper. 27 UE coun-tries described with 9 variables relating to the <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>activity</b> of farms are the analysed objects. The carried survey helps to show spatial disparities and to discriminate groups of countries with a similar farmers <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>activity.</b> There were used chosen methods of multidimensional comparative analysis which enable clustering the multicriterial objects: Czekanowskis diagram, Wards method, and k-mean algorithm. As a final result there were formed 5 clusters with countries about similar level of farm diversification. It may be stated, that a development of diversifica-tion of agricultural holdings is correlated with a spatial arrangement. Neighbouring countries belong to the same clusters of other gainful activity kinds.

The Red Terror (1977–1978) marked the beginning of a steady deterioration in the economic state of the nation, coupled with extractive policies targeting rural areas. The reforms of 1975 were revoked and the Agricultural Marketing Corporation (AMC) was tasked with extracting food from rural peasantry at low rates to placate the urban populations. The very low fixed price of grain served as a disincentive to production, and some peasants had to buy grain on the open market in order to meet their AMC quota. Citizens in Wollo, which continued to be stricken with drought, were required to provide a [...] "famine relief tax" [...] to the AMC until 1984. The Derg also imposed a system of travel permits to restrict peasants from engaging in <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>activities,</b> such as petty trading and migrant labor, a major form of income supplementation. However, the collapse of the system of State Farms, a large employer of seasonal laborers, resulted in an estimated 500,000 farmers in northern Ethiopia losing a component of their income. Grain wholesaling was declared illegal in much of the country, resulting in the number of grain dealers falling from between 20,000 and 30,000 to 4,942 in the decade after the revolution.|$|E

50|$|Agriculture was {{practiced in}} sub-Saharan Africa since the third {{millennium}} BC. Because of this, cities could develop as centers of <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>activity,</b> well before the influence of Arab urban culture. One of the oldest sites documented thus far, Jenné-Jeno in what is today Mali, has been dated to the third century BC. According to Roderick and Susan McIntosh, Jenné-Jeno did not fit into traditional Western conceptions of urbanity as it lacked monumental architecture and a distinctive elite social class, but it should indeed be considered a city based on a functional redefinition of urban development. In particular, Jenné-Jeno featured settlement mounds arranged according to a horizontal, rather than vertical, power hierarchy, {{and served as a}} center of specialized production and exhibited functional interdependence with the surrounding hinterland. Archaeological evidence from Jenné-Jeno, specifically the presence of non-West African glass beads dated from the third century BC to the fourth century AD, indicates that pre-Arabic trade contacts probably existed between Jenné-Jeno and North Africa. Additionally, other early urban centers in sub-Saharan Africa, dated to around 500 AD, include Awdaghust, Kumbi-Saleh the ancient capital of Ghana, and Maranda a center located on a trade rout between Egypt and Gao.|$|R
