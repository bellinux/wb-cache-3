30|$|The {{indiscriminate}} {{disposal of}} MSW without covering {{is considered a}} dangerous practice in integrated waste management at the global level. The fresh solid waste composition study shows that samples from the open dump site contained about 90 – 95  % combustible materials and <b>non-combustible</b> <b>fraction</b> is about 1 – 5  %. The composition of existing solid waste from old dumping area shows a significant variation at all depths and locations. It was observed that the dead leaves and wood chips and soil were 40 – 60 and 15 – 40  %, respectively. The plastic and paper composition was 8 – 15 and 0.5 – 15  %, respectively. Debris waste composition was 5 – 18  %. The physicochemical characteristic of leachate shows that the range of COD varies from 26, 880 to 45, 120  mg/l and the BOD 5 /COD ratio was less than 0.1. Hence, the characterization of leachate confirms the methanogenic condition of the dumpsite. Based on the average concentration, the heavy metal components in the old solid waste, leachate and soil {{were found in the}} following orders: Mn > Cu > Pb > Cd; Pb > Mn > Cu > Cd; Mn > Pb > Cu > Cd. The presence of heavy metals (Pb, Cu, Mn, and Cd) in soil sample indicates that there is appreciable contamination of the soil by leachate migration. This is indicated that the migration and distribution of the contaminants species are still localized and not diffused with a wide area. However, these pollutant species continuously migrate and percolate through the soil strata and after certain period of time might contaminate the groundwater system if no action is taken to prevent this phenomenon.|$|E
30|$|The {{indiscriminate}} disposal {{and crude}} dumping of MSW are {{considered as a}} dangerous practice in integrated waste management at the global level. The fresh solid waste composition study shows that samples from the open dump site contained about 90 – 95  % combustible materials and <b>non-combustible</b> <b>fraction</b> is about 1 – 5  %. The fresh leachate sample possesses very high concentration of chemical parameters except pH, when compared to stabilized leachate samples. The heavy metal concentration range of collected fresh leachate sample showed {{a higher degree of}} metal solubilization when compared to stabilized leachate samples. The pH values of all groundwater samples are within the range of BIS and WHO standards. The physicochemical analysis indicated that chlorides (range between 215.15 and 4, 098.73  mg/L) and TDS (ranges from 740 to 14, 200  mg/L) of the groundwater samples are higher than the permissible limits in all the sampling locations when compared to other parameters. The presence of heavy metals (Pb, Mn, Cu, Cd and Zn) in groundwater samples indicates that there is appreciable contamination by leachate migration from an open dumping site. Based on the average concentration, the heavy metal components in the groundwater samples were found in the following order: Pb > Mn > Cu > Cd > Zn. From the present study, {{it was found that the}} groundwater is non-potable because most of the physicochemical parameters and heavy metals examined exceed the permissible limits. Ultimately, all results presented show that the Ariyamangalam open dump site constitutes a serious threat to local aquifers. The details such as solid waste composition, leachate characteristics and characteristics of groundwater samples will be used to develop contaminant transport model using Visual MODFLOW and MT 3 DMS software for leachate migration into subsurface system from open dumping site.|$|E
40|$|Approximately 60 % of the CO 2 {{release from}} clinker pyroprocessing {{originates}} in limestone calcination, being the remaining related to fuel combustion. Biomass alternative fuels, such as wood wastes or sewage sludge, are currently considered effectively climate-neutral. Thus, this could enable {{a means to}} reduce global emissions without hindering the calcination capacity. On the other hand, a major advantage of the energy recovery in a kiln is that the <b>non-combustible</b> ash <b>fraction</b> is effectively recovered. High combustion temperatures, long residence times, high turbulence and alkaline conditions allow the complete conversion {{of even the most}} stable organic compounds. The kiln size provides a high thermal inertia resulting in very slow temperature changes. Thus, transient conditions due either to process malfunctions or feed changes do not lead to a significant conversion loss (safe use of alternative fuels). Recovery operations in cement plants are in compliance with both Directive 1996 / 61 /EC –also known as IPPC- and the Directive 2000 / 76 /EC.
