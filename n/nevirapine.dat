25|$|<b>Nevirapine</b> is a {{substrate}} for liver CYP3A and CYP2B6 enzymes. Concomitant {{administration of}} drugs that are inhibitors of these enzymes may increase serum <b>nevirapine</b> levels significantly. Some examples of these drugs include ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fluconazole. On the other hand, drugs that are inducers of these enzymes such as rifampicin may lower serum <b>nevirapine</b> levels.|$|E
25|$|Resistance to <b>nevirapine</b> {{develops}} rapidly if {{viral replication}} {{is not completely}} suppressed. The most common mutations observed after <b>nevirapine</b> treatment are Y181C and K103N, which are also observed with other NNRTIs. As all NNRTIs bind within the same pocket, viral strains which are resistant to <b>nevirapine</b> are usually also resistant to the other NNRTIs, efavirenz and delavirdine. However, second generation NNRTIs like rilpivirine and etravirine are effective in treatment for HIV strains resistant to <b>nevirapine</b> and other first generation drugs in that same class.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nevirapine</b> is used {{in adults}} and in {{children}} 6 years of age infected with HIV-1 as part of combination antiretroviral treatment (ART or cART). Mono treatment use of <b>nevirapine</b> is not indicated due to increased risk of resistance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nevirapine</b> {{may cause}} severe or {{life-threatening}} liver toxicity, usually {{emerging in the}} first six weeks of treatment. In 2000, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a black box warning on <b>nevirapine,</b> warning that it could cause life-threatening liver toxicity and skin reactions. Unacceptably high risk of serious liver symptoms in certain patient groups (women with CD4 count >250 and men >400) has led the U.S. DHHS to recommend the restriction of <b>nevirapine</b> use to those at lower risk, unless the benefit to the patient clearly outweighs the risk; although in the 2NN study which found these CD4 limits, the effect was seen only in patients recruited from Thailand. More recent studies on the use of <b>Nevirapine</b> in people with higher CD4 cell counts have come to the following conclusion: Treatment-experienced patients who start NVP-based combination therapy with low pre–ART and high current CD4 cell counts and an undetectable VL have a similar likelihood for discontinuing NVP therapy because of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), compared with treatment-naive patients with low CD4 cell counts. This suggests that NVP-based combination therapy may be safely initiated in such patients. However, in similar patients with a detectable VL, it is prudent to continue to adhere to current CD4 cell count thresholds. The U.S. Public Health Service Task Force advocates caution in the use of <b>nevirapine</b> in pregnancy due to toxicity issues, which may be exacerbated during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nevirapine</b> is not {{effective}} against HIV-2, as {{the pocket of}} the HIV-2 reverse transcriptase has a different structure, which confers intrinsic resistance to the NNRTI class.|$|E
25|$|Former U.S. President George W. Bush's PEPFAR {{funding of}} $500 {{million to help}} combat the African AIDS {{epidemic}} included <b>nevirapine,</b> among other medications and programs.|$|E
25|$|Although {{concerns}} {{have been raised}} about nevirapine-based regimens in those starting therapy with high viral load or low CD4 count, some analyses suggest that <b>nevirapine</b> may be effective in this group of people.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect of <b>nevirapine</b> is the {{development}} of mild or moderate rash (13%). Severe or life-threatening skin reactions have been observed in 1.5% of patients, including Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and hypersensitivity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nevirapine</b> is an inducer of {{cytochrome}} P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. It {{may reduce}} levels of several co-administered drugs including the antiretrovirals efavirenz, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir, {{as well as}} clarithromycin, ketoconazole, forms of hormonal contraception, and methadone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nevirapine</b> {{may also}} form a useful {{component}} of salvage regimens after virological failure, usually {{in combination with}} one or more PIs as well as nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTIs), especially in those who have not previously taken an NNRTI.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nevirapine</b> in triple {{combination}} therapy {{has been shown}} to suppress viral load effectively when used as initial antiretroviral therapy (i.e., in antiretroviral-naive patients). Some clinical trials have demonstrated comparable HIV suppression with nevirapine-based regimens to that achieved with protease inhibitors (PIs) or efavirenz.|$|E
25|$|Four {{drugs in}} the class of NNRTIs have been {{approved}} by regulatory authorities. These are the first generation NNRTIs <b>nevirapine,</b> delavirdine and efavirenz and the next generation NNRTI etravirine. Several other NNRTIs underwent clinical development but were discontinued due to unfavourable pharmacokinetic, efficacy and/or safety factors.|$|E
25|$|A {{major concern}} with this {{approach}} is that NNRTI resistance mutations are commonly observed in both mothers and infants after single-dose <b>nevirapine,</b> and may compromise the response to future NNRTI-containing regimens. A short course of maternal zidovudine/lamivudine is recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service Task Force to reduce this risk.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nevirapine</b> (NVP), marketed {{under the}} trade name Viramune among others, is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} and prevent HIV/AIDS, specifically HIV-1. It is generally recommended for use with other antiretroviral medication. It {{may be used to}} prevent mother to child spread during birth but is not recommended following other exposures. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|As HIV uses reverse {{transcriptase}} to copy its genetic material and generate new viruses (part of a retrovirus proliferation circle), specific drugs {{have been designed}} to disrupt the process and thereby suppress its growth. Collectively, these drugs are known as reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and include the nucleoside and nucleotide analogues zidovudine (trade name Retrovir), lamivudine (Epivir) and tenofovir (Viread), as well as non-nucleoside inhibitors, such as <b>nevirapine</b> (Viramune).|$|E
25|$|<b>Nevirapine</b> was {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in the United States in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is 2.16 to 16.62 USD per month as of 2014. As of 2015, the cost for a typical month of medication in the United States was more than 200 USD.|$|E
25|$|Co-administration of {{atorvastatin}} {{with one}} of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole, may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This {{is less likely to}} happen with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, protease inhibitors, or verapamil, and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as amiodarone and aprepitant. Often, bosentan, fosphenytoin, and phenytoin, which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, <b>nevirapine,</b> oxcarbazepine, rifampin, and rifamycin, which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Oral contraceptives increased AUC values for norethisterone and ethinylestradiol; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.|$|E
25|$|If HIV {{treatment}} {{has to be}} started while a patient is still on TB treatment, then {{the advice of a}} specialist HIV pharmacist should be sought. In general, there is no significant interactions with the NRTI's. <b>Nevirapine</b> should not be used with rifampicin. Efavirenz may be used, but dose used depends on the patient's weight (600nbsp&mg daily if weight less than 50nbsp&kg; 800nbsp&mg daily if weight greater than 50nbsp&kg). Efavirenz levels should be checked early after starting treatment (unfortunately, this is not a service routinely offered in the US, but is readily available in the UK). The protease inhibitors should be avoided if at all possible: patients on rifamycins and protease inhibitors have an increased risk of treatment failure or relapse.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 and 2002, {{the number}} of {{patients}} living with HIV/AIDS being identified through treatment services began to increase. As many as 69,000 of these people were the rural poor who had been infected when they sold their blood and plasma in the mid-1990s and who were unable to access or afford much-needed antiretroviral treatment. On the basis of the successes of programmes in other nations, such as Brazil, a free antiretroviral therapy programme was piloted in late 2002 in Shangcai county, Henan province, one of the most severely affected areas. Patients were provided with a combination of zidovudine or didanosine plus lamivudine and <b>nevirapine.</b> On the basis of the improved health status and survival of the initial cohort, the programme was scaled up in early 2003, mainly through the China CARES programme.|$|E
25|$|Mbeki's {{government}} did, however, {{introduce a}} law allowing cheaper locally produced generic medicines, and in April 2001 succeeded in defending a legal action brought by transnational pharmaceutical companies {{to set aside}} the law. AIDS activists, particularly the Treatment Action Campaign and its allies, thought that the law was intended to support a cheap antiretroviral drugs programme and applauded Mbeki's government. However, the Treatment Action Campaign and its allies were eventually forced to resort to the South African Courts which in 2002 ordered the government to make the drug <b>nevirapine</b> available to pregnant women to help prevent mother to child transmission of HIV. Notwithstanding and despite international drug companies offering free or cheap antiretroviral drugs, until 2003, South Africans with HIV who used the public sector health system could only get treatment for opportunistic infections they suffered because of their weakened immune systems, but could not get antiretrovirals designed to specifically target HIV. In November 2003, the government finally approved a plan to make antiretroviral treatment publicly available. It appears that this was only after the Cabinet had over-ruled the President.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Nevirapine</b> was {{discovered}} by Hargrave et al. at Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., one of the Boehringer Ingelheim group of companies.

2500|$|R100943 {{inhibited}} HIV-1 and {{was considerably}} effective against {{a number of}} key NNRTI-resistant mutants like G190A mutation, which caused high-level resistance to loviride (α-APA) and <b>nevirapine.</b> [...] G190A mutation was thought to cause resistance by occupying a part of the binding pocket that would otherwise be filled by the linker part of the butterfly shaped NNRTIs. R100943, in the horseshoe mode of binding, is located at a distance of approximately 6.0 Å from G190. When compared with <b>nevirapine</b> and loviride which bind in the butterfly shape the ITU derivatives revealed improved activity against Tyr-181C and Tyr-188L mutants. A structural study suggested that a potent TIBO compound could partly supplement for the effects of the Tyr-181C mutation by moving itself in the non-nucleoside inhibitor binding pocket (NNIBP) of the mutant RT. In this context, R100943 has [...] torsional freedom that enables the conformational alternations of the NNRTI. This torsional freedom could be used by the ITU derivate to bind to a mutated NNIBP and thus compensating for the effects of a resistance mutation. Nevertheless, the potency of R100943 against HIV-1 resistant mutants was not adequate for it to be considered as an effective drug candidate. Additionally, [...] the chemical stability of the imidoylthiourea part of the ITU derivative was not favorable for an oral drug.|$|E

[...] Both nucleoside and non-nucleoside RTIs inhibit the same target, the reverse transcriptase enzyme, an essential viral enzyme which transcribes viral RNA into DNA. Unlike nucleoside RTIs, which bind at the polymerase active site, NNRTIs bind to a hydrophobic pocket in the subdomain of p66 which is about 10 angstrom away from the active site (known as the NNRTI pocket).
