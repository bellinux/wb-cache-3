The two songs were arranged by Billy May, who had collaborated with Horner several times in the past.|$|E
5|$|Another riot {{occurred}} in August 1992 at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, during a co-headlining tour with Metallica. Prior to Guns N' Roses' appearance, Metallica's set {{was cut short}} after singer-guitarist James Hetfield suffered second-degree burns in a pyrotechnics accident. However, Guns N' Roses was unable to go on stage early, because Rose once again was late arriving at the venue. <b>Nearly</b> <b>an</b> hour into their show, Rose complained of voice problems before walking off stage, following which a riot erupted in downtown Montreal, resulting in an estimated $400,000 in damages. In November of that year, Rose was convicted of property damage and assault {{in relation to the}} Riverport riot; he was fined $50,000 and received two years' probation.|$|E
5|$|By early 2000, McKagan {{had begun}} {{working on a}} new project with singer Mark Lanegan and drummer Geoff Reading.

5|$|Despite the {{withering}} fire, Klenau's force reached Essling's edge, {{where his}} men set up 64 artillery pieces and bombarded the French for <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> hour. Taking the village by storm, Austrian cavalry {{poured into the}} village from the north, and the French were pushed out in a methodical advance. Klenau's batteries were able to fire on the French-held bridges south of the village, over which the French had to retreat. In bitter house-to-house fighting, the Austrians entered the village. Combat at the granary was especially brutal, as Hungarian grenadiers battled unsuccessfully to dislodge the French from their positions {{in the second and}} third floors. The battle resumed at dawn of 22 April. Masséna cleared Aspern of Austrians, but while he did so, Rosenberg's force stormed Jean Lannes' position at Essling. Lannes, reinforced by Vincent Saint-Hilaire's division, subsequently drove Rosenberg out of Essling. At Aspern, Masséna was driven out by Hiller and Bellegarde's counter-attacks.|$|E
5|$|In another case, 28-year-old British student Nathan Layton was {{bitten by}} a black mamba and {{died of a heart}} attack in less than an hour in March 2008. The black mamba had been found near a {{classroom}} at the Southern African Wildlife College in Hoedspruit, where Layton was training to be a safari guide. Layton was bitten by the snake on his index finger while it was being put into a jar, but he didn't realize he'd been bitten. He thought the snake had only brushed his hand. Approximately 30 minutes after being bitten Layton complained of blurred vision. He collapsed and {{died of a heart attack}}, <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> hour after being bitten. Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at the scene.|$|E
5|$|On {{flowering}} plants, {{the leaves}} are alternately arranged up the stem. They are thick and decurrent, with much variation in leaf shape between {{the upper and lower}} leaves on the stem, ranging from oblong to oblanceolate, and reaching sizes up to 50cm long and 14cm across (19inches long and 5inches wide). They become smaller higher up the stem, and less strongly decurrent down the stem. The flowering stem is solid and 2–2.5cm (<b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> inch) across, and occasionally branched just below the inflorescence, usually following damage. After flowering and seed release, the stem and fruits usually persist in winter, drying into dark brown, stiff structures of densely packed, ovoid-shaped, and dry seed capsules. The dried stems may persist into the following spring or even the next summer. The plant produces a shallow taproot.|$|E

5|$|The ship, with Stars of David {{painted on}} her funnels, {{pulled away from}} the dock at eight minutes before noon, <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> hour later than her planned {{departure}} time, and headed to Haifa, with an intermediate stop in Naples. On board were some 400passengers from all over the United States and Canada, most of whom were tourists wanting to see the Holy Land. Many of the passengers, including a contingent from the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, were also sailing in order to attend the dedication of the Hebrew University at Mount Scopus by former British Foreign Secretary Lord Balfour. President Arthur also carried agricultural equipment and trucks to be used for farm development in Palestine. In addition, the liner featured Bernice P. Schmitt and Rebeccca Adelman, who, according to contemporary news reports, were the first ever female officers on an ocean liner.|$|E
5|$|The BPF {{returned}} to action on 12 May and no Japanese aircraft were seen or detected that {{day or the}} next. One of Formidables Avengers made a successful landing aboard Indomitable with only one landing gear leg extended and no flaps on 13 May. The BPF continued its routine of two days of operations alternating {{with one or two}} days to replenish its ships for the next several days with minimal interference by the Japanese. On the morning of 18 May, armourers were loading ammunition into aircraft when a Corsair's guns were accidentally fired into an Avenger, which caught fire. The overhead fire sprinklers were immediately turned on, but the fire could not be extinguished for <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> hour, not least because the electric motors driving the steel fire curtains had been damaged in the first kamikaze attack and could only be repaired by a dockyard. Twenty-one Corsairs and seven Avengers were either damaged or destroyed in the incident. Rawlings decided to detach Formidable early to give her extra time for repairs in Sydney and she was ordered to depart on 22 May.|$|E
5|$|When the Secretary of State for Defence {{announced}} the {{contract for the}} vessels, the cost was initially estimated at £3.9billion. The contracts were officially signed one year later on 3 July 2008, after the creation of BVT Surface Fleet through the merger of BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions and VT Group's VT Shipbuilding which was a requirement of the UK Government. At the time of approval the first carrier was expected to enter service in July 2015 and the budget was £4,085m for two ships. The financial crisis led to a decision in December 2008 to slow production, delaying the first ship until May 2016 and the second by two years. This decision alone added £1,560m to the cost. By March 2010 the budget was estimated at £5,900m; taking off the cost of capital led to a MPR10 Capital DEL baseline cost of £5,254m at this time. If the carriers had been abandoned in the 2010 SDSR then the MoD could have cancelled £1.5bn of planned spending on Queen Elizabeth and £1.3bn of planned spending on Prince of Wales, but the loss of VAT exemption meant that cancelling one or two carriers would have overall saved £989m and £2,098m respectively. These long term savings were {{less important than the}} short term costs, there would have been <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> extra £1bn of expenditure on cancellation costs in the FY11/12 budget. In November 2013 the contract was renegotiated with a budget of £6,200m and BAE agreeing to pay 50% of any cost overruns rather than 10% as previously.|$|E

5|$|While Smith was {{attending}} junior high school, his parents divorced. Continuing {{to pursue his}} interest in baseball, he would ride the bus for <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> hour to reach Dodger Stadium, cheering for the Los Angeles Dodgers at about 25 games a year. Upon becoming a student at Locke High School, Smith played on the basketball and baseball teams. Smith was a teammate of future National Basketball Association player Marques Johnson on the basketball team, and a teammate of future fellow Hall-of-Fame player Eddie Murray on the baseball side. After high school Smith attended Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 1974 on a partial academic scholarship, and managed to walk-on to the baseball team. In addition to his academic education, he learned to switch-hit from Cal Poly coach Berdy Harr. When Cal Poly's starting shortstop broke his leg midway through the 1974 season, Smith subsequently took over the starting role. Later named an All-American athlete, he established school records in career at bats (754) and career stolen bases (110) before graduating in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Once in the environment, {{neptunium}} generally oxidizes fairly quickly, {{usually to}} the +4 or +5 state. Regardless of its oxidation state, the element exhibits {{a much greater}} mobility than the other actinides, largely due to its ability to readily form aqueous solutions with various other elements. In one study comparing the diffusion rates of neptunium(V), plutonium(IV), and americium(III) in sandstone and limestone, neptunium penetrated more than ten times {{as well as the}} other elements. Np(V) will also react efficiently in pH levels greater than 5.5 if there are no carbonates present and in these conditions it has also been observed to readily bond with quartz. It has also been observed to bond well with goethite, ferric oxide colloids, and several clays including kaolinite and smectite. Np(V) does not bond as readily to soil particles in mildly acidic conditions as its fellow actinides americium and curium by <b>nearly</b> <b>an</b> order of magnitude. This behavior enables it to migrate rapidly through the soil while in solution without becoming fixed in place, contributing further to its mobility. Np(V) is also readily absorbed by concrete, which because of the element's radioactivity is a consideration that must be addressed when building nuclear waste storage facilities. When absorbed in concrete, it is reduced to Np(IV) in a relatively short period of time. Np(V) is also reduced by humic acid if it is present on the surface of goethite, hematite, and magnetite. Np(IV) is absorbed efficiently by tuff, granodiorite, and bentonite; although uptake by the latter is most pronounced in mildly acidic conditions. It also exhibits a strong tendency to bind to colloidal particulates, an effect that is enhanced when in soil with a high clay content. The behavior provides an additional aid in the element's observed high mobility.|$|E
