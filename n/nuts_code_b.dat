In early 1939 {{it was decided that}} since a war might break out without warning or time to pass an Act of Parliament to bring in emergency regulations, the Regulations should be split into two codes. Code A would be needed immediately if war broke out and could be passed in peacetime, while <b>Code</b> <b>B,</b> containing more severe restrictions on civil liberties, would be brought in later. In order not to alert the public to the existence of <b>Code</b> <b>B,</b> <b>Code</b> A was simply numbered consecutively. Defence Regulation 18 concerned restrictions on movement of aircraft.

40|$|Through dynamic linking, Java {{supports}} a novel paradigm for code deployment, which ensures fast program start-up and linking {{with the most}} recent version of code. Thus Java dynamic linking, gives support for software evolution, by supporting a piece of code A which uses a piece of <b>code</b> <b>B,</b> to link at run-time with a version of <b>code</b> <b>B</b> which was created after A was created. Dynamic linking involves loading, verification, resolution and preparation of code. Programmers are normally {{not aware of the}} dynamic linking process. Nevertheless, in some situations, dynamic linking does manifest itself, and affects program execution and the integrity of the virtual machine. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} a description of dynamic linking at the level of the Java source language.
