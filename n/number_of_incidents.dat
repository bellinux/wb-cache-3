5|$|A key {{influence}} on the plot of The Calculus Affair was an article that Hergé had read in a February 1954 issue of the Belgian weekly La Face à Main, reporting {{that there had been}} a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidents</b> along the road from Portsmouth to London in southern England in which motorists' car windscreens had spontaneously shattered; the article's author suggested that it may have been caused by experiments undertaken in a nearby secret facility. To develop this plot further, Hergé consulted Professor , an astrophysicist at Liège.|$|E
5|$|Cemeteries, {{including}} those of war dead, are targets for vandalism. The gravestones, cemeteries and buildings of the Commission are no exception. The Commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework are usually the work of young people, noting the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidents</b> increases when schoolchildren are on school holidays. Metal theft is also a problem: determined thieves target the bronze swords from the Cross of Sacrifice, which are now replaced with replicas made of fibreglass.|$|E
50|$|Euler's {{proof of}} the degree sum formula uses the {{technique}} of double counting: he counts the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>incident</b> pairs (v,e) where e is an edge and vertex v {{is one of its}} endpoints, in two different ways. Vertex v belongs to deg(v) pairs, where deg(v) (the degree of v) is the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> edges <b>incident</b> to it. Therefore, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>incident</b> pairs is the sum of the degrees. However, each edge in the graph belongs to exactly two incident pairs, one for each of its endpoints; therefore, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>incident</b> pairs is 2|E|. Since these two formulas count the same set of objects, they must have equal values.|$|R

5|$|In {{the course}} of its history, Norwich City has survived a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidents</b> that {{threatened}} its survival, including ousting from amateur football, {{the need to be}} re-elected to The Football League and financial crises. Geoffrey Watling, who was to become club Chairman and after whom a stand at the club's stadium, Carrow Road is named, was instrumental in saving the club from bankruptcy, both in the 1950s and 1990s; his father had played a similar role in 1919.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidents</b> in recent years where the river has been {{polluted}} and fish have been killed. In 2004 a pipe was broken by builders while {{they were working on}} the upgrade of the Fofanny water treatment works, near the source of the river. This resulted in sediment running into the river and the flooding of the plant. Fish were not directly harmed by this incident, and the Water Service carried out an investigation to assure drinking water had not been affected. However, concerns were raised by the Shimna Anglers Club that {{this was not the first}} time building work had affected the river, and that there was the possibility of long term harm to the salmon and sea trout.|$|E
5|$|Worle {{has had a}} large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidents</b> of railway {{vandalism}} and antisocial behaviour, and {{the stretch}} of line through Worle {{is considered one of}} the most vandalised in the United Kingdom– obstructions have been left on the line and stones have being thrown at railway staff. There have been several incidents of train guards being attacked by passengers who refused to pay their fares, including one incident where the guard was dragged from the train and knocked to the ground. Vandals have also damaged the station's ticket machines, attacked passengers and slashed the tyres of cars parked at the station.|$|E
40|$|After {{machining}} {{of steel}} by femtosecond laser ablation unexpected surface structures are {{found at the}} bottom of the machined area.

5000|$|To force this {{alternative}} emission to occur, an incident photon must strike the fluorophore. This {{need to be}} struck by an incident photon has two implications for STED. First, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>incident</b> photons directly impacts the efficiency of this emission, and, secondly, with sufficiently large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> photons fluorescence can be completely suppressed. [...] To achieve the large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>incident</b> photons needed to suppress fluorescence, the laser used to generate the photons must be of a high intensity. Unfortunately, this high intensity laser {{can lead to the}} issue of photobleaching the fluorophore. Photobleaching is the name for the destruction of fluorophores by high intensity light.|$|R

5|$|Doom 3 {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2145. Much of the game's story and {{dialogue}} was created by author Matthew J. Costello. According to the game's backstory, the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC) has grown to become the largest corporate entity in existence, and has set up a research facility on Mars. At this base, the UAC are able to conduct research into several scientific areas, including advanced weapons development, biological research, space exploration and teleportation. On Mars, the UAC can perform its operations outside of legal and moral boundaries. As the player progresses through the game, they learn that the employees on the base are unsettled due to a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidents</b> involving hearing voices, unexplained sightings and increasing cases of paranoia and insanity, often leading to fatal accidents with the facility's machinery. Rumors regarding the nature of experiments in the UAC's Delta Labs division are especially prevalent among the base's employees.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{owing to the}} success both {{domestically}} and in Europe of Aberdeen and Dundee United, the pair were known as the New Firm. However, Dundee United have their city neighbours Dundee as close rivals, and the antagonism was not always reciprocated to the same degree. The same situation applies to Aberdeen's rivalry with Rangers, in that Rangers have their own much older and well-known Old Firm rivalry with Celtic. Aberdeen's rivalry with Rangers arose after a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidents</b> in matches between the two clubs in the 1980s, namely Willie Johnston's stamp on John McMaster's neck in the Scottish League Cup and Neil Simpson's tackle on Ian Durrant in 1988, as well as Aberdeen's dominance in Scottish football throughout the decade. There are still often violent clashes between both sets of supporters within and outwith the stadium to this day.|$|E
5|$|At 12:50, a force {{comprising}} {{elements of}} the 121st and 125th Home Guard regiments and the 265th Reconnaissance-Sabotage Company managed to cross the Sava River at {{the confluence of the}} Sava and Una. The crossing force of 80 soldiers, encountered a minefield, VRS artillery fire and small arms fire from bunkers near the river bank. Extraction of the force began after 14:00, leading to an exchange of heavy artillery fire between the VRS on one bank and the 121st and the 125th Home Guard regiments' battlegroups on the other. The withdrawal required several river crossings using the available boats, and resulted in further losses. The situation was further complicated for the HV but a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidents</b> and factors. These included a tugboat towing a damaged amphibious vehicle which caught fire because of faulty wiring, insufficient fire support from river gunboats, and boat crews provided by the 34th Engineer Battalion who refused to cross the river against VRS fire and had to be replaced by conscripts of the 33rd Engineer Battalion. Despite HV use of unmanned aerial vehicles to locate the VRS guns as targets for counter-battery fire, the artillery exchange continued late into the night of 19/20 September.|$|E
40|$|Many non-iterative imaging {{algorithms}} {{require a}} large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>incident</b> directions.

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Acton, west London, Friday was scouted, but not retained, by four {{professional}} clubs during his teenage years. He appeared for local semi-professional sides in the Isthmian League until he joined Charlie Hurley's Fourth Division Reading team in 1974—quickly becoming a key player, he helped Reading to win promotion to the Third Division during the 1975–76 season. As his drug habit intensified, Friday's form began to dip {{in the first half}} of the 1976–77 season, leading Reading to sell him to Second Division side Cardiff City around the New Year. Friday travelled to join his new team by train without a valid ticket and had to be bailed by the Cardiff manager Jimmy Andrews before he signed for the club. He performed strongly on his debut, but afterwards his form declined and his personal life caused him to repeatedly miss matches altogether. Following a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidents,</b> on and off the field—including kicking Mark Lawrenson in the face —Friday retired from football in December 1977, aged 25. He died in Acton in 1990, aged 38, after suffering a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|On 27 February 2002, the Godhra train burning {{incident}} {{initiated a}} series of riots in Gujarat. Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya on the Sabarmati Express train were attacked and the train, which had stopped at Godhra station, was set on fire causing the death of 58 Hindus including 25 women and 15 childrenactivists of Vishva Hindu Parishad and Kar Sevaks. Following the attack, false rumours were spread by a senior Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader that Muslims had kidnapped three Hindu girls during the incident. Retaliatory attacks on Muslims began the same evening; a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidents</b> in which Muslims were attacked and killed were reported in various cities in Gujarat before the Naroda incident. The first attacks on the Muslim community occurred at Ahmedabad, where Hindu mobs began throwing stones and later burnt Gulbarg Society, a Muslim housing complex.
