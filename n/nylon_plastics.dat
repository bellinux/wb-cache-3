40|$|The plasticizer, n-butylbenzenesulfonamide (NBBS), is {{reported}} to be neurotoxic when inoculated intracistemally or intraperitoneally into rabbits. Because NBBS is commonly used in the production of polyamide (<b>nylon)</b> <b>plastics</b> and is soluble in water, the disposal of NBBS-containing plastics in landfill sites could result in NBBS appearing in the leachate. Further, NBBS could also be leached from packaging into their contents. To allow us to examine the risks posed by NBBS in the environment, we have developed a quantitative assay for this compound. The assay employs a one-step extraction into dichloromethane followed by gas chromatography with accurate mass selected ion recording. The assay incorporates [t 3 C 6]NBBS as an internal standard to allow precise quantitation, and four separate ion chromatograms are recorded. NBBS was found in some Australian domestic solid-waste landfill leachate (from less than 0. 3 to 94. 6 ng/mL), but ground water in the vicinity of a landfill had only trace quantities of NBBS. NBBS was also quantitated in some bottled and cask wines, and levels varied from not detected to 2. 17 ng/mL (n = 14). Additional studies are required to assess the public health risks {{associated with the use of}} NBBS as a plasticizer...|$|E

50|$|Plastic casings are {{generally}} made from polymers such as polyamide, polypropylene, or polyethylene. Polyamide (<b>Nylon)</b> <b>plastic</b> casings {{are the most}} commonly used in production of cooked sausages and hams such as luncheon meat and bologna. Polyamide casings come in two main varieties: Oriented and non-oriented. The oriented polyamide are shrinkable casings and will shrink during the cooking process thereby reducing the water loss. Non-oriented polyamide casings remain the same diameter during the cooking process and thereby allow for expansion of the meat during cooking. The use of polyamide casings has expanded recently with the advent of various varieties and structures of casings such as multilayer casings.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, there were {{selected}} societies such as the 'Coliseo Derkes' and 'Grupo Primavera', which endowed performing arts as well as scientific events. By the mid-twentieth century, Guayama achieved great industrial development, especially {{with the establishment of}} Univis Optical Corp., Angela Manufacturing Company and a petrochemical complex of the Phillips Petroleum Company. In 1968, the company started production of paraffin, benzene, synthetic fibers, <b>nylon,</b> <b>plastic</b> anhydrous, a million gallons of gasoline a day, and many other products. During that same decade agriculture began to decline as a result of land loss, industrialization and the construction of multiple housing developments. The urban growth affected the sugar cane industry. However, in 1974, 155,595 tons of sugar cane was harvested in the Municipality producing 12,655 tons of refined sugar.|$|R
50|$|Muzzles are {{sometimes}} used on untrained dogs, large or small, to prevent unwanted biting or scavenging. They {{can also be}} used on dogs who display aggression, whether motivated by excitement, fear or prey drive. They are usually made with a strong buckle or other fastening device to ensure that they do not come off accidentally. Muzzles are also used on dogs when there is a risk of them taking baits that have been laid for vermin. The most suitable materials for dog muzzles are leather, <b>nylon,</b> <b>plastic</b> and others. The most comfortable muzzles for dogs are those with wire cage construction. Muzzles of this kind give enough freedom for a dog to eat, drink and freely pant. The latter two are of vital importance, especially in hot weather.|$|R

50|$|Many trail runners use {{specially}} designed shoes that have aggressively knobby soles that {{are generally more}} rigid than road running shoes. The usually EVA compound midsole often contain a lightweight, flexible <b>nylon</b> <b>plastic</b> layer to protect the feet from puncture wounds from sharp rocks or other objects. Since trail running take place on softer surfaces (e.g., grass, dirt) than road races, cushioning is not as important so often the shoes are less 'cushioned' than their counterparts designed for tarmac, that's why you often get shoe brands like Vivobarefoot who specialise in thin soled trainers for trail runners. Additionally, trail running shoes are {{low to the ground}} which provides the best stability on uneven terrain. Recently, very thick sole running shoes are gaining popularity especially in Ultra-marathons. In events over 100 miles, they were {{the most common type of}} shoe used in 2013.|$|R

50|$|In martial arts, a waster is a {{practice}} weapon, usually a sword, and usually {{made out of}} wood, though <b>nylon</b> (<b>plastic)</b> wasters are also available. The use of wood or nylon instead of metal provides an economic and safe option for initial weapons training and sparring, at some loss of genuine experience.

Wasters as wooden practice weapons have been found in a variety of cultures over a number of centuries, including ancient China, Ireland, Scotland, Rome, Egypt, medieval and renaissance Europe, Japan, and into the modern era in Europe and the United States. Over the course of time, wasters took a variety of forms not necessarily influenced by chronological succession, ranging from simple sticks to clip-point dowels with leather basket hilts to careful replicas of real swords.|$|R

40|$|In the {{production}} of complex plastic parts, injection molding {{is one of the}} most popular industrial processes. This paper addresses the modeling and analysis of the flow process of the nylon (polyamide) polymer for injection molding process. To determine the best molding conditions, a series of simulations are carried out using Autodesk Moldflow Insight software and the processing parameters are adjusted. This mold filling commercial software simulates the cavity filling pattern along with temperature and pressure distributions in the mold cavity. In the modeling, during the plastics flow inside the mold cavity, different flow parameters such as fill time, pressure, temperature, shear rate and warp at different locations in the cavity are analyzed. Overall, this Moldflow is able to perform a relatively sophisticated analysis of the flow process of pure nylon. Thus the prediction of the filling of a mold cavity is very important and it becomes useful before a <b>nylon</b> <b>plastic</b> part to be manufactured...|$|R

50|$|In May 1998 a NEO {{head was}} fitted, which enabled {{the engine to}} be {{classified}} as a low emission vehicle (LEV) engine due to their lower fuel consumption and emission output. The NEO head featured solid lifters rather than hydraulic, revised camshafts, with on/off solenoid Variable VCT, used a hotter 82 °C thermostat, model-specific coil packs and a revised inlet manifold (the runner diameter is reduced from 50mm to 45mm to increase air velocity and low end torque) in particular the RB25DE NEO which had two inlets going into the inlet manifold. The combustion chamber of the head is smaller so GT-R spec connecting rods are used to compensate as well as model-specific pistons. The turbo received the larger OP6 turbine which some came with steel compressor and turbine wheels, where others had the <b>nylon</b> <b>plastic</b> compressor wheel and ceramic turbine wheel.

50|$|Bicycle frames {{utilizing}} pressed bearing standards do {{not have}} any threads inside the bottom bracket shell. The bottom bracket is pressed directly into the frame. Using pressed in standards allows frame manufacturers greater flexibility in frame design that many times offers greater stiffness and weight reductions. The current pressed-bearing standards (and developed by) are: BB30 (Cannondale), PF30 (SRAM), BB90 & BB95 (Trek), BB86 & BB92 (Shimano), BB79 (Cervelo’s BBRight), and BB386EVO (FSA and BH bicycles). In BB30, BB90 & BB95 systems: the bearings are pressed directly into the frame. For PF30, BB86 & BB92, BB79, and BB386EVO; the bearing is housed in a <b>nylon</b> <b>plastic</b> cup that is pressed into the frame’s bottom bracket shell. Pressed in standards usually require two-piece cranksets where the spindle is attached to one of the crankarms. Due to fixed spindle length and diameter, cranksets designed for one pressed standard may not be compatible with another. For example, a crankset made specifically for BB30 will not fit in a BB86 bottom bracket and frame. There are other instances where adapters can be used to fit a crankset made for one standard into another. For example, a Shimano (two piece Hollowtech II 24mm OD spindle) road crankset can fit into a BB30 bottom bracket shell (42mm ID) using aftermarket adapters.|$|R
