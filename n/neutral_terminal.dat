The lamp's power cord must be connected so that the wire from the wide blade on the power cord plug (neutral) connects to the <b>neutral</b> <b>terminal</b> on the socket, and the wire from the narrow blade on the plug (hot) connects to the black wire on the switch.|$|E

In this configuration, the switched lamp one live terminal for the night light socket is exposed externally on the base of the socket, to be wired to the remote candelabra socket. Hence, this type of socket has a Hot terminal, a <b>Neutral</b> <b>terminal,</b> and a switched Hot terminal. This creates a confusing situation in which a keyed 3-way socket (which has a 3-contact socket at the top of it) has only two terminal screws, while a night-light socket (which does not have a 3-contact socket at the top) has three terminal screws on the base.|$|E
50|$|When {{mains voltage}} TRIACs are {{triggered}} by microcontrollers, optoisolators are frequently used; for example optotriacs {{can be used}} to control the gate current. Alternatively, where safety allows and electrical isolation of the controller isn't necessary, one of the microcontroller's power rails may be connected one of the mains supply. In these situations it is normal to connect the <b>neutral</b> <b>terminal</b> to the positive rail of the microcontroller's power supply, together with A1 of the triac, with A2 connected to the live. The TRIAC's gate can be connected through an opto-isolated transistor, and sometimes a resistor to the microcontroller, so that bringing the voltage down to the microcontroller's logic zero pulls enough current through the TRIAC's gate to trigger it. This ensures that the TRIAC is triggered in quadrants II and III and avoids quadrant IV where TRIACs are typically insensitive.|$|E

Its effects have been investigated for single generator unit connection. However, there is a dearth of information on its effects on parallel generator unit connection which is a more practical situation in generating stations. In this work, the effect of parallel generator unit-connection on third harmonic earth fault protection is investigated. Ordinary non-linear algebraic equations obtained from non-fault and earth fault circuit models of two generators connected in parallel using Kirchhoff’s voltage and current laws for different load conditions were solved using Cramer’s rule. Simulation of the models for earth fault at stator <b>neutral</b> and <b>terminal</b> were performed for no-load, light load and full load using MATLAB/SIMULINK. The value of third harmonic voltage at stator <b>neutral</b> and <b>terminal</b> were estimated for the different load conditions.

50|$|The {{danger of}} not {{following}} that rule {{is perhaps best}} illustrated by considering, as an example, a light with a screw-in bulb. If you were to make the error of connecting the 'hot' from the 3-way switch's common terminal to the neutral wire of the light (or the light's <b>neutral</b> <b>terminal),</b> you will in fact have connected the 'hot' to the fixture's 'shell' (the threaded metal outer shell that the bulb screws into). Then, whenever the power is 'on' at the fixture, the shell is energized. If you then ever go to change the bulb without first being sure the power is off at the fixture, you will be at {{a greater risk of}} being shocked versus if you had not wired the 3-way hot to the load neutral. That is because now you will get 'shocked' if you touch the shell while changing the bulb if the fixture is powered, whereas if you had connected the hot from the 3-way switch to the light fixture's hot side, and if the power were on at the fixture when you change the bulb, the only way you could get shocked is by touching the small bare terminal that is all the way inside {{at the base of the}} shell.|$|E

40|$|The {{behavior}} of transformers under DC components {{has been since}} long studied. One of the principal sources of these components is the AC-DC energy conversion, in which unsymmetrical direct current components can arise. Another important phenomenon are the Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GIC), caused by an increased solar activity, which introduce an off-set in the grounded <b>neutral</b> <b>terminals</b> of power transformers. Among the literature there {{can also be found}} different investigations about the harmful effects that DC components may cause in power transformers. The presence of a DC component induces an offset on the flux flowing through the transformer core, which can lead the transformer into saturation. An increase on the magnetic field is immediate, and high associated magnetization currents appear. As a consequence of this, harmful harmonics and a distorted secondary voltage can also be observed. Furthermore, the increased magnetizing currents caused by the DC bias can lead to high leakage fluxes (increasing the losses) and localized hot spots on the tank walls. Experimental setups and different measurements like the ones shown in this thesis can be useful in order to know in detail how the {{behavior of}} the transformer under DC influence is and which are the most harmful effects that may occur during transformer operation.

The photolysis of the uranium azide species [{U(TrenDMBS) } 4 (Il:r(r{N 3) 4] led to the isolation of the mixed valent bimetallic uranium (IV IV) nitride complex [{U(TrenDMBS) h(Il-N) ], which is best formulated as containing a [U-N=U] core. In contrast, photolysis of the terminal azide complex [U(N 3) (Tren TIPS) ], resulted in intitial N 2 evolution to yield a transient uranium(VI) nitride which quickly underwent C-H activation of the ligand to afford the uranium(IV) amido complex [U {(NHCMe 2 Siipr 2 NCH 2 CH 2) N(CH 2 - CH 2 NSiipr 3) 2 }]. A two-electron redox reaction of the sterically demanding uranium(III) complex, [U(Tren TIPs) ] with sodium azide afforded the dimeric bridging uranium(V) nitride species [{U(Il-N) (Il-K) (Tren TIPS) h]' Abstraction and encapsulation of the sodium cation was achieved through treatment with polydentate crown ether 12 -crown- 4 to afford the first example of a terminal uranium(V) nitride complex, [U (N) (Tren TIPs) ] [N a(l 2 C 4 h]. This species can be oxidised to the <b>neutral</b> <b>terminal</b> uranium(VI) nitride, [U(N) (Tren TIPS) ], through oxidation with iodine. [U(N) (Tren TIPs) ] exhibits an exceptionally short U=N bond length of 1. 799 (9) A, consistent with a triple bond. The U=N linkage has been analysed by X-ray diffractometry, 15 N-isotopic labelling, electronic absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies, magnetometry, and electronic structure calculations. Additionally the uranium(V) imido complexes [U(NSiMe 3) (Tren TIPS) ] and [U(NAd) (Tren TIPS) ] (Ad = adamantyl) were synthesised through two-electron oxidation of organic azides with [U(Tren TIPS) ]. The terminal amido complex [U (NH 2) (Tren TIPS) ] was synthesised through the reaction of [U (Tren TIPs) ] with [NI 1 BU 4] [N 3]. Single-molecular-magnets, defined as molecules that exhibit slow relaxation of the magnetisation of purely molecular origin, are intensively researched due to the prospective applications in molecular electronics. Recently chemists have reported a handful of uranium(III) complexes which exhibit SMM behaviour. However observation of slow relaxation is not limited to uranium(lII) species. In this work the first monometallic uranium(V) SMM, [U(O) (Tren TIPs) ], synthesised through a two electron oxidation of [U(Tren TIPs) ] with Me 3 NO, is reported. Attempts to synthesise ~ VI ~ n The Synthesis of Terminal Uranium Nitride Complexes the analogous terminal uranium sulphide through various routes only resulted in the isolation of the dinuclear uranium(IV) sulphido complex [{U(Tren TIPS) b(/l-S) ]. The isolation of a uranium(V) SMM suggests that uranium may offer a substantial role in the future of SMM chemistry. ~ VIIEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A new {{criterion}} {{to detect}} the stator single-phase-to-ground fault for Powerformer is proposed in this paper, {{which is based on}} the direction of leakage currents, magnitude of leakage currents, and fault point energy dissipation. New fault character-istics of Powerformer are analyzed and a novel criterion is put forward. The proposed approach detects the ground fault by an-alyzing the direction, magnitude, and energy of leakage current, which is the difference of zero-sequence current fault component between the <b>neutral</b> and the <b>terminal</b> of Powerformer. The funda-mental component and the third-harmonic component of leakage current are combined to realize 100 % coverage of fault detection for the stator windings of Powerformer. Simulation results have shown that, under different fault conditions, the new scheme can distinguish internal faults from external faults reliably, and can detect in which machine a stator single-phase-to-ground fault is occurring even if the fault resistance is at 5 kΩ.

30|$|The PK {{properties}} of YTE Fc variant and WT huE 6 F 6 {{were examined in}} hFcRn transgenic mice following a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of 10 mg/kg antibody (n =  6 animals per antibody). The relevant PK parameters and average serum concentration time profiles were shown in Table  1 and Fig.  1 E, respectively. As expected, the YTE variant, with substantial binding to hFcRn at both acidic and <b>neutral</b> pH, showed <b>terminal</b> half-life significantly extended by 1.5 -fold compared with WT huE 6 F 6 in mice (WT, t 1 / 2  =  20.1 ± 7.5 h; YTE, t 1 / 2  =  30.9 ± 10.8 h; P < 0.05; Table  1, Fig.  1 E). Mean CL, the volume of serum antibody cleared per unit of time, was approximately 1.2 -fold lower for the YTE variant compared with WT in mice (WT, CL =  0.01063 ± 0.0029 mL/min/kg; YTE, CL =  0.00897 ± 0.00224 mL/min/kg; P < 0.05; Table  1, Fig.  1 E), indicating {{a significant decrease in}} the clearance of the YTE variant. Since the area under the curve (AUC) is inversely proportional to CL, the area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated from time zero to infinity (AUCinf) was ~ 1.2 -fold higher for the YTE variant (20, 100 ± 6, 730 h·μg/mL) than for WT huE 6 F 6 (17, 200 ± 6, 240 h·μg/mL, P < 0.05, Table  1, Fig.  1 E), indicating {{a significant increase in the}} total exposure of the YTE variant in mice.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{theoretical}} {{study is}} presented of complex formation between DNA fragments of different base sequences and isolexins, "isohelical base reading polymers", formed of heteroaromatic pentagonal rings joined by appropriate linkers. Extensive computations are performed for the isolexin {{composed of the}} furan-pyrrole-furan sequence. They involve charged ligands with propioamidinium groups at both ends as well as <b>neutral</b> molecules with <b>terminal</b> methyl, carbonyl and amino groups. Two different groups (C = O and NH) are used as linkers between the base reading moieties. The role of these elements on the binding preference of the ligands has been examined. The {{results show that the}} mere possibility of formation of hydrogen bonds between a ligand and the nucleic acid bases is not sufficient to ensure its binding specificity which is determined largely by the interplay of electrostatic factors. Thus the dicationic isolexins uniformly prefer AT sequences. For the neutral isolexins the nature of the groups forming the linkers is a major factor in defining the specificity, although these groups do not participate directly in the interaction with DNA. The C = O linkers favour binding to AT sequence while the N-H linkers permit preferential binding to the GAG sequence. Finally, {{for the first time in}} theoretical computations, a ligand is proposed which should bind preferentially to the minor groove of GC sequences: this ligand is a neutral isolexin composed of three furan rings linked by two N-H groups. This ligand is considered as an improvable prototype. Altogether the results presented open the path for the designing of minor groove ligands specific for any desirable DNA base sequence.

40|$|The {{identification}} of two unsaturated N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) produced by Rhodobacter sphaeroides bacteria, based on liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to a hybrid quadrupole linear ion trap (LTQ) -Fourier transform {{ion cyclotron resonance}} (FTICR) mass spectrometer upon electrospray ionization (ESI), is presented. Along the confirmation of the signaling molecule already described in the literature, i. e. (Z) -N-tetradec- 7 -enoyl-homoserine lactone (C 14 : 1 -HSL), we have discovered the occurrence, at low yet significant levels, of another monounsaturated compound, C 12 : 1 -HSL, which may extend the number of small diffusible chemical signals known for R. sphaeroides. Both unsaturated AHLs were identified by high resolution FTICR mass spectrometry in extracts of bacterial culture media and the occurrence of a C=C bond was assessed upon their conversion to bromohydrins. Collision induced dissociation (CID) spectra were then collected on the LTQ mass analyser. A careful comparison of tandem MS spectra of monounsaturated (i. e., C 12 : 1 -HSL and C 14 : 1 -HSL) and saturated AHLs (i. e. C 12 -HSL and C 14 -HSL) led to emphasise two series of product ions, exhibiting 14 Da-spaced m/z ratios. Both series were referred to progressive fragmentations at the aliphatic end of the AHL acyl chains, followed by <b>neutral</b> losses of <b>terminal</b> alkenes (i. e., CH 2 =CH(CH 2) nH). In particular, the series located at the higher end of the explored m/z range (> 200 Da), observed only for monounsaturated species, enabled {{the location of the}} C=C bond between carbons 7 and 8 of the acyl chain...|$|R
