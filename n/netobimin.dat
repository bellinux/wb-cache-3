5000|$|Ruminants are {{the main}} {{definitive}} host of this fluke but other herbivorous animals, carnivores, and humans can be accidental definitive host. [...] Most infections, especially in cows, are asymptomatic but {{the effect on the}} liver depends on the number of flukes and the length of infection. Since the fluke migrates up the biliary duct—but does not penetrate the gut wall or liver tissue—long infections may cause hypertrophy of the bile duct and liver lesion, {{even in the absence of}} symptoms. [...] While infections with D. dendriticum are usually symptom free, some animals may show anemia, edema, emaciation, and liver cirrhosis. [...] However, many of the symptoms of dicroceliosis are similar to those of other gastro-, intestinal-, and lung-nematode infectionsThe diagnosis of D. dendriticum flukes is mainly from the recovery of adults in liver during necropsy or detecting eggs in animal feces. There is some evidence connecting decreased liver function from the trematode infection with pregnancy toxaemia and mastitis in ewes when combined with other risk factors. Treatment can be difficult due to the fluke's complex life-cycle. Various antihelminths, especially <b>Netobimin,</b> have been shown to be effective treatment when an entire herd is infected. Animal husbandry practices can decrease the incidence of infection. This includes the avoidance of animal grazing early in the day or late in the evening when ants are more likely to climb to the top of the grass blade.|$|E

Faecal strongyle egg counts (EPG) were performed by a modified McMaster???s technique before and after the treatment. Neither NTB nor ABZ were present and only albendazole sulphoxide (ABZSO) and sulphone metabolites (ABZSO 2) were detected in the plasma samples. Maximum plasma concentration of ABZSO (0. 53 ?? 0. 14 ??g/ml) and ABZSO 2 (0. 36 ?? 0. 09 ??g/ml) were observed at (tmax) 10. 50 and 19. 50 h, respectively following administration of NTB. The area under the curve (AUC) of the two metabolites was similar to each other. <b>Netobimin</b> was not detected, and ABZ was predominant in faecal samples. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of (???) ABZSO was significantly higher than (+) ABZSO, but the area under the curves (AUCs) of the enantiomer were not significantly different each other in plasma samples.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the influence of route of administration, drug formulation and modified-liver metabolism on the pharmacokinetic and metabolic patterns of benzimidazole anthelmintics in ruminants.

The efficacy of NTB conversion by the gastrointestinal (GI) microflora, was markedly lower after subcutaneous (SC) administration of NTB pro-drug compared with enteral administrations in both species. Although trisamine and zwitterion formulations of NTB were bioequivalent after SC treatment, the zwitterion suspension was two-fold more bioavailable in terms of ABZ metabolites, after oral administration to cattle. ABZ sulphoxide (ABZSO) and ABZ sulphone (ABZSO$ sb 2 $), the main metabolites found in plasma, were reversibly exchanged between plasma and GI compartments and concentrated in the abomasum.

The rate of ABZ sulphoxidation by liver microsomes was significantly lower in cattle compared to sheep. However, while the oxidizing activity was greater in GI fluids of cattle, the reducing activity was prevalent in those of sheep. This was consistent with the higher ABZSO$ sb 2 $/ABZSO ratio and the markedly faster disposition of both metabolites in cattle compared to sheep.

The areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) for ABSO and ABSO 2 were significantly (P < 0. 05) larger following administration for ABSO than NTB in 1 -month- and 8 -month-old sheep. The AUC for the ABSO and ABSO 2 metabolites were larger following administration of ABZ than NTB in 1 -month- but not 8 -month-old sheep and the AUC of the ABSO and ABSO 2 metabolites were greater following ABSO than ABZ as parent compound in 8 -month-old sheep only. The larger AUC values for metabolites following administration of ABSO as the parent compound were generally coincident with significantly higher maximum (Cmax) concentrations {{and not with}} persistence in the body, since mean residence times (MRT) of the metabolites {{were not significantly different}} from those determined following ABZ and NTB as parent compounds. The lower metabolite concentration following administration of NTB may have been a feature of its requirement for metabolic conversion and its larger molecular weight. Correction of AUC values for molecular weight removed any significant differences between AUC values for either metabolite in 8 -month-old lambs. The corrected metabolite AUCs following NTB were, however, significantly lower than those following ABSO administration in 1 -month-old lambs, suggesting that immature metabolic processes in these animals contributed to the lower relative bioavailability of NTB in this age group.

The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of commonly used oral drenches in sheep in France, Greece and Italy. In each country, 10 farms were selected. On each farm, 50 animals were blocked based on the pre-treatment faecal egg count (FEC). Within each block, animals were randomly allocated to one of 5 treatment groups. In addition to an untreated control group, there were 4 groups treated per oral route: moxidectin (MOX) and ivermectin (IVM), both at 0. 2 mg/kg bodyweight, levamisole (LEV; at 7. 5 mg/kg bodyweight) and a benzimidazole (BZ; at 3. 75 - 5 mg/kg bodyweight). In France, animals were not treated with LEV, but with <b>netobimin</b> (NET; at 7. 5 mg/kg bodyweight). The FEC was monitored using a modified McMaster technique. Two weeks after treatment, individual faecal samples were taken from all animals and efficacy was calculated as the difference between arithmetic mean FEC of the control group versus each respective treatment group. The results of the present study indicate the high efficacy of treatment with oral formulations of MOX (99 - 100 %) and IVM (98 - 100 %) on all farms, except on 1 farm in Greece. On this farm, multi drug resistance (MDR) was identified involving 4 anthelmintics (efficacy MOX: 91 %; IVM: 0 %; BZ: 58 % and LEV: 87 %).
