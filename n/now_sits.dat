5|$|The stadium <b>now</b> <b>sits</b> amongst {{a unique}} urban skyline {{and is the}} oldest Division I FBS {{football}} stadium. In fact, the only Division I stadiums older are Franklin Field at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard Stadium. Grant Field was natural grass until 1971. The astroturf was replaced by grass in 1995. The stadium officially holds 55,000 but has held up to 56,412 in 2005 and 56,680 in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In a {{nighttime}} raid, {{under the cover}} of darkness and a distraction by a P-61 Black Widow, the group surprised the Japanese forces in and around the camp. Hundreds of Japanese troops were killed in the 30-minute coordinated attack; the Americans suffered minimal casualties. The Rangers, Scouts, and guerrillas escorted the POWs back to American lines. The rescue allowed the prisoners to tell of the death march and prison camp atrocities, which sparked a new rush of resolve for the war against Japan. The rescuers were awarded commendations by MacArthur, and were also recognized by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. A memorial <b>now</b> <b>sits</b> {{on the site of the}} former camp, and the events of the raid have been depicted in several films.|$|E

5|$|Nearby is {{the former}} site of St. Mary's (Whitechapel Road) tube station. It opened in March 1884 but its close {{proximity}} to both Whitechapel and Aldgate East tube stations made it superfluous, leading to its closure in April 1938. It {{was used as an}} air raid shelter in the Second World War, but was destroyed by bombing in 1940. Opposite to the south {{is the former}} Royal London Hospital building, built in 1740. The hospital suffered significant structural damage during the Second World War, but much of the 18th and 19th centuries architecture still remains. A new building <b>now</b> <b>sits</b> adjacent to the original.|$|E
5|$|A log {{portion of}} the {{original}} Oklahoma Row was moved north and <b>now</b> <b>sits</b> {{on the east side}} of Highway 94 in Monte Ne. It is used for storage. The three-story concrete-and-stone tower still stands and remains above water on the edge of Beaver Lake. This section is often incorrectly referred to as the bank building and the honeymoon suite. Monte Ne was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 because of the historic significance of being so closely associated with Harvey and its unique architecture and engineering. Despite this, what is left of Monte Ne has fallen victim to severe neglect and vandalism. It is covered with spray paint and graffiti, as well as being cracked and full of debris. In 2011 the fire department was called to help a person who had climbed to the top floor and gotten stuck in the chimney. Because of this incident and the general state of the remains, the Army Corps of Engineers erected a temporary barbed wire fence around the tower.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to professional baseball and football, the stadium hosted other amateur and professional sports, large entertainment events, and other civic affairs. It was demolished by implosion in March 2004 after {{being replaced by}} the adjacent Citizens Bank Park and Lincoln Financial Field. A parking lot <b>now</b> <b>sits</b> on its former site.|$|E

25|$|The Tallapoosa River, at {{the site}} where Yates Dam <b>now</b> <b>sits,</b> was the earlier site of the first {{hydroelectric}} dam in Alabama, built in 1902, by Henry C. Jones, an Auburn University electrical engineer. Rebuilt after the flood of 1919, the dam that then belonged to the Montgomery Light & Water Power Company {{was replaced by a}} third dam, the 1928 Yates Dam.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the first Sydney cricket test in February 1882, the ground could boast two grandstands; the Brewongle Stand at the {{southern}} end and the original Members' Stand, which had been built in 1878 in the north west corner where the current Members' Stand <b>now</b> <b>sits.</b> On opposite sides of the ground to the stands two spectator mounds were built.

25|$|Sculptor Brenda Putnam {{was hired}} in May 1930 to design a {{sculpture}} of Puck for a garden {{on the west side}} of the building. Decades of exposure weakened the statue, and after Puck's right hand was found across the street at the Library of Congress in 2000, the original piece was moved. It <b>now</b> <b>sits</b> above the entrance to the Elizabethan Theatre, and an aluminum statue replaced the original in the garden.|$|E
25|$|A fragmentary late 10th century cross {{located in}} St Stephen's Church, Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria, England, {{features}} a bound figure with horns and a beard. This figure is sometimes theorized as depicting the bound Loki. Discovered in 1870, the stone consists of yellowish-white sandstone, and <b>now</b> <b>sits</b> {{at the front}} of the Kirkby Stephen church. A depiction of a similarly horned and round-shouldered figure was discovered in Gainford, County Durham and is now housed in the Durham Cathedral Library.|$|E

25|$|The Shirley family pew {{was carved}} in 1627. The {{rest of the}} box pews date from the 18th century. The Shirley family pew <b>now</b> <b>sits</b> {{to the left of}} the main {{monument}} in the north aisle. In the past this wooden structure was said to be in the main body of the church. It is appropriate that it is now in the vaulted north aisle, as this entire aisle was in the separate ownership of the Shirley family until the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Cox is a Eurosceptic. She rebelled {{over the}} Maastricht Treaty, {{supporting}} {{an amendment to}} require a nationwide referendum on ratification on 14 July 1993. In May 2004 she joined three other Conservative peers in signing a letter published by the UK Independence Party urging voters to support it in the elections to the European Parliament. The Leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Howard, immediately withdrew the party whip, formally expelling them from the parliamentary party. Cox <b>now</b> <b>sits</b> in the House of Lords as a crossbencher.|$|E
25|$|While {{the site}} on which Yellowknife <b>now</b> <b>sits</b> was long {{known to the}} Dene whose copper knives later gave it its name, and had been visited by European explorers in the late 18th century, it did not attract any {{settlement}} until gold {{was found in the}} greenstone belts of the Canadian Shield underlying the area. By 1936 it was a mining boomtown, and most of today's Old Town was built on the bay. Canada's entry into World War II three years later put that on hold, but after the war mining and development resumed.|$|E
