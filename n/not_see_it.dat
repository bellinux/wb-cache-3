5|$|Another {{person to}} testify was Robert Havelka, {{who worked as}} a {{security}} guard the night of the incident. Havelka said that the guardrail was too close to the stage, but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage. He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan's fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, though he did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> precisely.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{days later}} Dundas claimed a {{probable}} victory against a Bf 110, after {{a battle with}} German aircraft six miles north of RAF Warmwell at 16:30. Despite firing a 12–14 second burst at the enemy fighter, he did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> crash. During the battle Dundas {{was hit in the}} leg when a cannon round exploded in his cockpit, but flew again the next day. The Spitfire Dundas flew that day, R6915, still exists, having been preserved by the Imperial War Museum. By 9 October 1940, his score stood at 10 and he was award the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E

Reyes says that Doggett has spent the last few years convincing himself he did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> Reyes believes it was a psychic clue, and now with the other crime scene, she has seen it again.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{traditional}} Israeli historiography, Arab {{sources in}} general do <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as {{a turning point}} in the war. They agree that the Egyptian declarations regarding Tel Aviv as the main strategic objective were ostentatious rather than operative. In his book 1948, New Historian Benny Morris also disagrees with the traditional Israeli view, and states that portraying the operation as the catalyst for the Egyptian halt is a mistake. However, in a March 15, 2007 panel of historians, Morris said that at least in the Egyptian expeditionary force, the Israeli attack did lead to a decision to stop advancing.|$|E
5|$|As the war progressed, Hitler's {{attention}} became {{focused on}} foreign affairs and {{the conduct of the}} war, to the exclusion of all else. Hess, not directly engaged in either of these endeavours, became increasingly sidelined from the affairs of the nation and from Hitler's attention; Bormann had successfully supplanted Hess in many of his duties and usurped his position at Hitler's side. Also concerned that Germany would face a war on two fronts as plans progressed for Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union scheduled to take place in 1941, Hess boldly decided to attempt to bring Britain to the negotiating table by travelling there himself to seek meetings with the British government. He asked the advice of Albrecht Haushofer, who suggested several potential contacts in Britain. Hess settled on fellow aviator Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, the Duke of Hamilton, whom he had never met. On Hess's instructions, Haushofer wrote to Hamilton in September 1940, but the letter was intercepted by MI5 and Hamilton did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> until March 1941. Hamilton was chosen in the mistaken belief {{that he was one of}} the leaders of an opposition party opposed to war with Germany, and because he was a friend of Haushofer.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} {{primarily}} in Cornwall and the Upper Boat Studios in Wales. The {{exterior of the}} pirate ship was filmed at a dock in Cornwall, while the lower decks were built from a set at the studio. The principal challenge to film at the dock was to ensure the audience would <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> The crew set up smoke machines to simulate fog. To create the storm the crew used wind and rain machines, the latter of which went through 15,000 litres of water. The loud noise from the wind machines caused communication difficulties during takes. Anticipating they would get soaked, the cast present on the deck wore dry suits underneath their clothes. Before filming began on the storm sequences, Darvill heard that he would perform the stunt where he is thrown into the sea, and was willing to perform it. The stunt would later be performed by a double.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{returned}} to operational flying in early 1941 in 616 Squadron, which was forming {{part of the}} Tangmere Wing. Johnson often found himself flying alongside Wing Commander Douglas Bader and Australian ace Tony Gaze. On 15 January 1941, Johnson, the recently appointed Squadron Leader Burton and Pilot Officer Hugh Dundas, who arrived back at the squadron on 13 September 1940, took off to offer cover for a convoy off North Coates. The controller vectored the pair onto an enemy aircraft, a Dornier Do 17. Both attacked the bomber and lost sight of it and each other. Although the controllers intercepted distress signals from the bomber Johnson did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> crash. They were credited with one enemy aircraft damaged. It {{was the only time}} Johnson was to engage a German bomber. By the end of January, Johnson had added another 16.35 flying hours on Spitfires.|$|E
5|$|KG 53 {{approached}} North Weald {{from the}} east between Maldon, Essex and Rochford. No. 56 Squadron's 12 Hurricanes engaged the bombers, while No. 54 Squadron’s 11 Spitfires engaged the escorting Bf 109s and Bf 110s. In the engagement, at least one Bf 110 was shot down. The line of advance was now clear to the British ground controllers. Five Squadrons: No. 46, 85, 151, 257, and 310 with 61 Hurricanes, were scrambled to intercept the bombers in front of, or over the target. By 17:00 the airfield was covered in 5/10ths stratocumulus at 5,000 feet. Within thirty minutes the cloud base fell to just 3,500 feet. The German formation leaders soon realised {{that there was no}} hope of hitting a target from 12,000 feet, particularly when they could <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> At 17:40, KG 53 turned away and headed for base. They had lost a single bomber to 56 Squadron. Things were about to change. As they turned around, 28 Hurricanes from Nos. 46, 85, and 151 Squadron prepared for a head-on attack. Meanwhile, 12 Hurricanes from 256 Squadron closed on the Germans from behind.|$|E

25|$|California Memorial Stadium {{has seen}} {{a number of major}} events {{throughout}} the years other than California football. Before 1970, the general commencement exercises of the University of California was regularly held at Memorial Stadium. The large campus-wide commencement, however, was cancelled in 1970 because of the many protests that were taking place at the time—university officials at the time did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> wise to have such a large gathering annually with the protests going on. General Commencements have since returned to the University of California campus, with the exercises being performed at Haas Pavilion, Hearst Greek Theatre, and most recently Edwards Stadium. On March 23, 1962, to commemorate Charter Day (the anniversary of the founding of the University of California), President John F. Kennedy gave a speech at Memorial Stadium in front of an above capacity crowd of 88,000.|$|E
25|$|The police further {{speculated that}} the victims did not {{initially}} realize the danger they were facing, {{the location of the}} bodies in the estate's second floor indicated that they did not consider escaping when they faced their intruder, and in spite of the unexpected and dramatic break-in nobody made any effort to alert the police or others. One explanation may be that the victims initially did not feel the intruder to be threatening or did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> necessary to contact the police. The fact that Kristian Orderud was killed while lying in his bed, indicated that the perpetrator was not a random predator without intimate knowledge of the family, but rather knew exactly who his victims were. This was backed up by the fact that nothing was missing from the house, ruling out a robbery.|$|E

25|$|On the ground, a Bosnian Serb Army 2K12 Kub {{surface-to-air missile}} battery near Mrkonjić Grad was readying to fire its {{missiles}} on NATO aircraft. The Serbs had moved the mobile tracked missile battery and laid a trap. They switched on their missile radars sparingly, giving F-16 fighters little warning. Waiting until a plane was directly overhead, where the aircraft's warning and countermeasures {{would be at}} their weakest, they fired two missiles. In the cockpit, O'Grady's instruments alerted him that a missile was coming but, because he was flying through an overcast, he could <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> The first missile exploded between the two aircraft. The second struck the F-16 piloted by O'Grady. His flight lead, Captain Bob Wright, saw O'Grady's plane burst into flames and break in two. Wright did not see a parachute, but O'Grady survived by ejecting from the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Beach {{appeared}} on {{maps of the}} time, notably that of Abraham Ortelius of 1570 and that of Jan Huygen van Linschoten of 1596, as the northernmost part of the southern continent, the Terra Australis, along with Locach. According to Marco Polo, Locach was a kingdom where gold was “so plentiful that no one who did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> could believe it”. Beach {{was in fact a}} mistranscription of Locach. Locach was Marco Polo’s name for the southern Thai kingdom of Lavo, or Lop Buri, the “city of Lavo”, (ลพบุรี, after Lavo, the son of Rama in Hindu mythology). In Chinese (Cantonese), Lavo was pronounced “Lo-huk” (羅斛), from which Marco Polo took his rendition of the name. In the German cursive script, “Locach” and “Boeach” look similar, and in the 1532 edition of Marco Polo’s Travels his Locach was changed to Boëach, later shortened to Beach.|$|E
25|$|Britain {{declared}} war on Germany on 3 September 1939. Staton commanded the first British air raid on Berlin {{on the night of}} 1/2 October 1939, leading four of No. 10 Squadron's Whitleys to the enemy capital through severe weather to drop propaganda leaflets. On 20 February 1940, Staton was awarded one of the first three Distinguished Service Orders (DSO) granted to the RAF during the war. The DSO is customarily awarded for meritorious or distinguished service in combat. He is known to have flown on numerous raids during this time and been disappointed by the inaccuracy he observed. He attempted to rectify the situation by use of flares for target marking. He also suggested forming a unit dedicated to marking targets; though he would <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> this suggestion would eventually lead to formation of the Pathfinder Force, later raised as No. 8 Group, Bomber Command. In the same edition of the London Gazette he also received a mention in despatches.|$|E
