5|$|Rosenberg left a will {{in which}} he {{requested}} that his body be cremated using quicklime. Most of his estate was left to his children; the will stated that his Torah and yad were {{to be given to}} his son Adolph, but this was <b>not</b> <b>done</b> as they remained in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{lesson from the}} Tunisia Campaign was that neuropsychiatric casualties had {{to be treated as}} soon as possible and not evacuated from the combat zone. This was <b>not</b> <b>done</b> {{in the early stages of}} the Sicilian Campaign, and large numbers of neuropsychiatric casualties were evacuated to North Africa, with the result that treatment became complicated and only 15 percent of them were returned to duty. As the campaign wore on, the system became better organized and nearly 50 percent were restored to combat duty.|$|E
5|$|Around 1812 Lambert Rosey, {{a member}} of the Terrouanne family, {{demolished}} the building's north wing. In 1832, Rosey sold the building to Amédée Naudin for 12,000 francs. Work began in the east wing, with its depth reduced and its layout becoming more irregular. Naudin died on 21 November 1864, and his two daughters sold the residence on 5 June 1866 for 40,000 francs. From 1868 to 1869, it was restored under the direction of Félix Duban; in 1877, further restoration work was planned but <b>not</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Pratt & Whitney studied {{retrofitting}} B-52s {{with four}} Pratt & Whitney PW2000 (F117) engines, {{but this was}} <b>not</b> <b>done,</b> since all B-52s were {{to be replaced by}} B-1s and B-2s by the late 1990s. In 1996 Rolls-Royce and Boeing jointly proposed to fit B-52s with four leased Rolls-Royce RB211-535 engines, but this plan failed because of Air Force resistance to leasing combat assets and a negative Air Force economic analysis which was later disputed as flawed.|$|E
5|$|Isabel Macedo {{had played}} several villains, {{including}} in Floricienta, {{and took the}} Patricia Longo-Jimena Benitez role because it was something she had <b>not</b> <b>done</b> before. Although Patricia's past identity as Jimena {{was intended to be}} a secret for only ten episodes, Macedo insisted that the mystery should be maintained for a longer time. She read about victims of school bullying to inform her character and declined other work during the year to stay focused on the series, becoming emotionally attached to her character.|$|E
5|$|Korene Hinds {{participated in}} the women's 3000meters steeplechase, an {{obstacle}} run event. Born in the former Jamaican capital of Spanish Town, Hinds participated in Beijing at age 31.

She was the only Jamaican in the heat. However, Hinds did not finish the race, and was one of three athletes in the heat (along with Brazil's Zenaide Vieira and Bulgaria's Dobrinka Shalamanova) do have <b>not</b> <b>done</b> so.|$|E

Now in charge of Dong Zhuo's army, he defeats Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Sun Jian in several campaigns, and takes over the land.|$|E
5|$|Most ALF vapor cells use {{alkali metals}} {{because of their}} high vapor pressures; many alkali metals also have {{absorption}} lines and resonance in the desired spectra. Common vapor cell materials are sodium, potassium and caesium. Note that non-metallic vapors such as neon may be used. As the early quantum counters used solid state metal ions in crystals, {{it is conceivable that}} such a medium could be used in the ALFs of today. This is presumably <b>not</b> <b>done</b> because of the superiority of atomic vapors in this capacity.|$|E

5|$|Purchasing {{the section}} allowed Gardiner {{to fix the}} {{drainage}} problems that had deteriorated {{the surface of the}} trail, and to ban the use of motor vehicles, something the Wallkill Valley Land Trust had <b>not</b> <b>done.</b> Though the section was worth $307,300, the Wallkill Valley Land Trust sold it to Gardiner for $70,000.|$|E
5|$|The B {{converted}} {{the line to}} Taunton to mixed gauge by 1 June 1875, but {{the remainder of the}} line to Exeter was <b>not</b> <b>done</b> until 1 March 1876, three months after the B had amalgamated with the GWR. The remainder of the lines beyond Exeter were converted to standard gauge on 21 May 1892 so the extra rails at Temple Meads fell into disuse and were removed to leave a purely standard gauge layout. This allowed the through station to be rebuilt with two additional platform faces.|$|E

The family {{remained}} in Finland, a former Grand Duchy under Russian rule, which had declared its independence in December 1917. They hoped that the White Russians would prevail. They gradually ran out of supplies and had to beg for help from family. In July 1918, Victoria wrote to her first cousin, Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, begging her to send baby food so she could feed Vladimir. She was alienated from England because she felt her English relatives had <b>not</b> <b>done</b> enough to help the Romanovs.|$|E
