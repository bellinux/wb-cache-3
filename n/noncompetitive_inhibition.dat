In a study of DAHP synthase sensitive to tyrosine in E. coli, it was determined that the enzyme is inhibited by tyrosine through <b>noncompetitive</b> <b>inhibition</b> with respect to phosphoenolpyruvate, the first substrate of the reaction catalyzed by DAHP synthase, while the enzyme is inhibited by tyrosine through competitive inhibition with respect to D-erythrose 4-phosphate, the second substrate of the reaction catalyzed by DAHP synthase when the concentration of tyrosine is above 10 μM. It was also determined that the enzyme is inhibited by inorganic phosphate through <b>noncompetitive</b> <b>inhibition</b> with respect to both substrates and inhibited by DAHP through competitive inhibition with respect to phosphoenolpyruvate and <b>noncompetitive</b> <b>inhibition</b> with respect to D-erythrose 4-phosphate. Studies of product inhibition have shown that phosphoenolpyruvate is the first substrate to bind to the enzyme complex, inorganic phosphate is the first product to dissociate from the enzyme complex.

40|$|AbstractActive {{transport}} of thiamin (vitamin B 1) into Escherichia coli occurs through {{a member of}} the superfamily of transporters known as ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Although it was demonstrated that the sulfhydryl-specific modifier N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) inhibited thiamin transport, the exact mechanism of this inhibition is unknown. Therefore, we have carried out a kinetic analysis of thiamin transport to determine the mechanism of inhibition by NEM. Thiamin transport in vivo exhibits Michaelis–Menten kinetics with KM= 15 nM and Vmax= 46 U mg− 1. Treatment of intact E. coli KG 33 with saturating NEM exhibited apparent <b>noncompetitive</b> <b>inhibition,</b> decreasing Vmax by approximately 50 % without effecting KM or the apparent first-order rate constant (kobsd).

Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of inhibition of these receptors is important for the development of new tools for drug discovery. Our objective has been to determine the pharmacological activity of the antagonist suramin, the most important antagonist of purinergic receptor function, as well as to demonstrate its <b>noncompetitive</b> <b>inhibition</b> and confirm a competitive mechanism between ATP and TNP-ATP in 1321 N 1 glial cells stably transfected with the recombinant rat P 2 X(2) receptor. A radioligand binding assay was employed to determine whether suramin, TNP-ATP, and ATP compete for the same binding site on the receptor. TNP-ATP displaced [alpha-P- 32]ATP, whereas suramin did not interfere with [alpha-P- 32]ATP-receptor binding. To determine the inhibition mechanism relevant for channel opening, currents obtained in fast kinetic whole-cell recording experiments, following stimulation of cells by ATP in the presence of suramin, were compared to those obtained by ATP in the presence of TNP-ATP. Supported by a mathematical model for receptor kinetics [Breitinger, H. G., Geetha, N., and Hess, G. P. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 84198429], the inhibition factors were plotted as functions of inhibitor or agonist concentrations.

A kinetic model based on an ordered Bi-Bi mechanism was proposed considering the <b>noncompetitive</b> product <b>inhibition</b> of dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and the competitive product inhibition of NADH. By obtaining preliminary kinetic parameters of substrate and product inhibition, the number of estimated parameters was reduced from 10 to 4 for a nonlinear regression-based kinetic parameter estimation. The simulated values of time-concentration curves fit the experimental values well, with an average relative error of 11. 5 % and 12. 7 % for Mn-GDH and GDH, respectively. A comparison of the binding energy of enzyme ternary complex for Mn-GDH and GDH derived from kinetic parameters indicated that metal ion substitution accelerated the release of dioxyacetone. The metal ion’s role in catalysis enhancement was explicated...|$|R
40|$|A chlorosis-inducing toxin of Pseudomonas phaseolicola was {{examined}} for inhibition of ornithine carbamoyltransferease prepared from acetone powder of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) plants. The enzyme has a pH optimum at 8. 5, involves a ternary complex reaction mechanism, and shows Michaelis constants of 5. 0 mm and 1. 7 mm for ornithine and carbamoylphosphate, respectively. Assuming reversible catalysis, Michaelas constants of 11 mm and 3. 3 mm are calculated for citrulline and arsenate. Toxin induces allosteric competitive inhibition {{in relation to}} carbamoylphosphate and a <b>noncompetitive</b> mode of <b>inhibition</b> in relation to ornithine, except at high toxin concentrations where uncompetitive inhibition is observed. In the backward assay, competitive inhibition is observed for both arsenate and citrulline. Inhibition is increased with preincubation time and shows saturation kinetics with regard to toxin concentration...|$|R
40|$|A {{protease}} inhibitor has been purified by ultracentrifugation, affinity chromatography on trypsin-sepharose 4 B, and chromatofocusing on PBE- 94 from hemolymph of the scorpion Heterometrus bengalensis. Homogeneity of the {{protease inhibitor}} was demonstrated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The protease inhibitor is a monomeric glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 120, 000 dalton, which is stable between pH 4 and pH 8. The molecule inhibits serine proteases like trypsin and ot-chymotrypsin and shows a <b>noncompetitive</b> mode of <b>inhibition</b> towards trypsin, with a Ki value of 6. 1 x 10 - 6 mM. Amino acid analysis shows {{a preponderance of}} aspartic acid, glutamic acid, serine, and glycine. The protease inhibitor is efficient in inhibiting phenoloxidase activity in both the hemolymph and the isolated phenoloxidase. Melanin synthesis by phenoloxidase {{may be influenced by}} this protease inhibitor...|$|R
