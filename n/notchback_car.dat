40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} investigation of the bootdeck flow structure of a 36 per cent scale model <b>notchback</b> <b>car</b> are presented together with a general review of advanced laser diagnostic techniques suitable for large-scale wind tunnel flow measurement. The tests were used to characterize the flow behaviour over the Reynolds number range 0. 74 x 10 (6) - 4. 93 x 10 (6) in the Cranfield University 2. 4 m x 1. 8 m wind tunnel. The experiments involved flow visualization, rear bootdeck and backlight three-dimensional stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements, and mean static and unsteady static pressure measurements. Initial results from the flow visualization suggested flow asymmetries originating in the backlight region that were sensitive to the Reynolds number. The PIV data and static pressure data, however, showed little or no sensitivity of flow to Reynolds number with consistent flow structure and levels of unsteadiness from the backlight to the rear bootdeck region. At this stage no definitive reasons can be given for the discrepancies between the flow visualization and the other data, although the flow visualization data were particularly difficult to interpret near the backlight, and the near-wake structure may be bi-stable in this Reynolds number range. More detailed three-dimensional stereoscopic, time-resolved PIV flow data are now planned to quantify conclusively the correct flow structure and its sensitivities...|$|E

50|$|The Fastback, or TL version, a {{fastback}} coup√©, {{arrived in}} August 1965, {{at the same}} time the 1600 engine was introduced. Volkswagen's intention was that this model should replace the Notchback, which is what happened in the UK market, but in other markets, including the German domestic market, the number of customers preferring the older <b>Notchback</b> shaped <b>car</b> was higher than foreseen, and in the end both Notchback and Fastback body shapes remained in production until July 1973.|$|R

The Century name was now applied to the entire range except for the coupe, which retained the Regal name. A fastback coupe ("aeroback") and aeroback sedan were added (the body was shared with the Oldsmobile Cutlass Salon), which was a revival of an appearance used in the late 1940s on the Buick Super {{and again in the}} late 1960s on the Buick Skylark. It was also offered as a station wagon and two- and four-door <b>notchbacks.</b> The <b>car</b> was over a foot shorter, several inches narrower, and several hundred pounds lighter than its predecessor. V6 engines were still standard due to fuel economy regulations. Big block engines were gone and the new base powerplant was Buick's new [...] V6, introduced specifically for the Century and Regal. The [...] V6, and the Chevrolet 305 V8 were options. The Pontiac [...] and [...] replaced the Chevrolet engine for 1979.|$|R
