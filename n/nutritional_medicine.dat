Jackson {{expressed}} his desire for Diprivan; [...] "it was the only medication that makes him fall asleep straight away". Lee was concerned, he seemed to have a familiarity with it. Jackson told Lee he had been administered Diprivan before but only for surgery, not for anything else. Lee says she didn't know what Diprivan was, so she called a doctor friend of hers who said it was an anesthetic used for surgery in hospital. Jackson told her other doctors had said Diprivan was safe to use, that all he needed was to be monitored. Jackson asked her to stay that night because he wanted to show Lee he was unable to sleep, he slept for 5 hours, woke up and was upset that he didn't sleep longer and that the <b>nutritional</b> <b>medicine</b> wasn't working. He then said [...] "the only thing that helps is Diprivan, can you find someone to help me sleep?" [...] "as soon as Diprivan gets in my veins it knocks me out and I go to sleep right away". Lee said [...] "I know you want to be knocked out but what if you don't wake up?" [...] "I just need to be monitored". She told Jackson that no one who cared or had his best interests at heart would give him propofol. Jackson complained to Lee that not sleeping would [...] "mess up my performance".

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{unprecedented}} growth in both the quantity and methodological quality of research directed at exploring the relationship between nutrition and mental health.

40|$|This action {{research}} {{was carried out}} {{within the context of}} a Professional Doctorate thesis. The aims were: to build up sound evidence to substantiate my arguments for the role of <b>Nutritional</b> <b>Medicine</b> as a vital partner of 21 st century medicine, particularly in the area of prevention and treatment of chronic disease; to critically investigate the context and conditions within which this profession aspires to secure a respectable position along the spectrum of contemporary medical practice; and to evaluate the possibility of inclusion of <b>Nutritional</b> <b>Medicine</b> in the National Health System of Cyprus. Aiming to enhance and strengthen the validity and reliability of the evidence, four different methodologies were used, based on the logic of triangulation. A volume of existing knowledge, obtained from a profound review of the work and writings of several scholars, and researchers, and from official reports, both at national (Cyprus) and international level, was contrasted, compared, and updated with fresh knowledge created by: A Survey conducted in Cyprus during the period October-December 2008, with the support of the University of Nicosia; Interviewing a representative number of key actors, on the basis of their authority to directly or indirectly influence the workings and politics of the practice of medicine in Cyprus; and, Analysis of a number of randomly selected case studies from my clinical practice as a <b>Nutritional</b> <b>Medicine</b> practitioner. The analysis and synthesis of findings revealed that the first decade of the twenty first century coincides with a high awareness, both worldwide and in Cyprus, for the rising incidence of chronic disease which, in spite of the unprecedented developments in several areas of the provision of healthcare of the last decades, appears to occur at increasingly lower ages and within the most deprived groups of the population. A multitude of developments at all levels - political, medical, academic, and social - demonstrate significant trends towards a new philosophy in the provision of healthcare which, as proposed by key actors and scholars, focuses on the whole patient rather than the disease and emphasises prevention rather than treatment. Within this New Paradigm in the provision of healthcare <b>Nutritional</b> <b>Medicine</b> appears to be an important, evidence-based, partner. The volume of evidence substantiating the vital inter-disciplinary role of Nutritional Science is impressive and increasingly rising. The example of the United Kingdom is presented in this report, where, in recognition of its important contribution in enhancing public health, <b>Nutritional</b> <b>Medicine</b> (otherwise termed Nutritional Therapy) is coming under regulation.

40|$|In {{particular}} situations, {{clinical trials}} researchers {{could have a}} potential interest in assessing trends {{at the level of}} individual subjects. This paper establishes a common approach and applies it in two different situations, one from <b>nutritional</b> <b>medicine</b> and one from cardiovascular medicine. The approach consists of running as many regression models as the number of subjects, looking at the behavior of some parameter of interest in time. The regression parameters, particularly the slope of the regression line, offer the general sense of the trend and allow for testing its statistical significance. Extrapolation {{at the level of the}} entire sample is possible using some version of the binomial test. In both cases, significant results were obtained despite of small sample sizes...|$|E
40|$|Adjuvant use of <b>nutritional</b> and herbal <b>medicines</b> has {{potential}} {{to increase the}} efficacy of synthetic pharmaceuticals, and perhaps also decrease their side-effects by allowing lower doses to be prescribed. We evaluated current evidence for adjuvant use of <b>nutritional</b> and herbal <b>medicines</b> with antidepressants, mood stabilizers and benzodiazepines; and explored novel future areas of research. The paper also critiques current evidence for co-administration of St. John’s wort with synthetic antidepressants. We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, The Cochrane database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and the Chinese Science Citation Database. Search results were supplemented by a review of reference lists and a forward search using the Web of Science. Where possible we calculated effect sizes. Encouraging evidence exists {{for the use of}} omega- 3 fatty acids, SAMe, folic acid and l-tryptophan adjuvantly with antidepressants to enhance response and improve efficacy. Various nutrients also have emerging evidence as effective adjuncts with antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. While some evidence supports nutritional adjuvancy with various psychopharmacotherapies, adjuvant use of herbal therapies has not been sufficiently studied to warrant standard clinical application. This remains a promising area of research via robust, safety-conscious studies. Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved...|$|R
