50|$|An {{increase}} in moisture {{stress in the}} rooting medium as small as 5 atmospheres affects growth, transpiration, and internal water balance in seedlings, much more so in Norway spruce than in birch, aspen, or Scots pine. The decrease in <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>rate</b> is greater in the spruce than in the other species, and, of those species, only the spruce shows no {{increase in}} water use efficiency as the soil becomes drier. The two conifers show larger differences in water potential between leaf and substrate than do the hardwoods. Transpiration rate decrease less in Norway spruce than in the other three species as soil water stress increases up to 5 atmospheres in controlled environments. In field conditions, Norway spruce needles lose {{three times as much}} water from the fully turgid state as do birch and aspen leaves, and twice as much as Scots pine, before apparent closure of stomata (although there is some difficulty in determining the exact point of closure). Assimilation may therefore continue longer in spruce than in pine when plant water stresses are high, though spruce will probably be the first to “run out of water”.|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{influence}} of balanced mineral fertilization on <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>rate</b> during maize ontogenesis was examined. Two groups of hybrids were {{used throughout the}} experiments: hybrids with middle early ripeness (400 FAO) and late ripeness hybrids (700 FAO). A seven-year field experiment was carried out on Chromic Luvisol (WRBSR FAO, 1998) at the experimental station of G. Lozen and on Calcic Chernozem (WRBSR, FAO, 1998) at the experimental station of Kovachitza. It {{was found that the}} effect of mineral fertilization on the average values of <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>rate</b> was more strongly expressed in maize cultivated on Chromic Luvisol (WRBSR, FAO, 1998). The trend of dependency showed a maximum of <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>rate</b> at fertilizer concentrations of 214 kg. ha- 1 and 150 kg. ha- 1 for N and P, respectively. When maize was grown on Calcic Chernozem (WRBSR, FAO, 1998), the effect of mineral fertilization was more slightly expressed.

40|$|Effects {{of drought}} on {{photosynthesis}} of two co-occurring oak species (Quercus robur and Q. petraea) have been assessed under natural conditions in a 30 -y-old stand. Leaf conductance and <b>net</b> CO 2 <b>assimilation</b> <b>rates</b> have been measured at midday in situ during two successive summers (1991 and 1992). Chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters were monitored before dawn {{during the summer}} of 1991. A severe drought was imposed on two trees per species, resulting in decreases of pre-dawn leaf potential to about - 2. 0 MPa during both years. Both species showed the same overall response to drought: gradual decrease of <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> and leaf conductance but maintenance at substantial levels down to strong water deficits, stability of the pre-dawn photochemical efficiency of PS II during the whole period of drought, and declines in pre-dawn fluorescence (both basic and maximal levels) owing probably to changes in the optical properties of leaves during maturation. It was concluded that both species displayed a strategy of tolerance to drought, and they displayed efficient protection mechanisms against permanent high irradiance damage. Slight differences were observed between both species, Q. robur displaying smaller leaves, lower chlorophyll contents, and a larger stomatal conductance at equivalent <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>rates</b> than Q. petraea.

The response variables evaluated were: crop growth rate, relative growth rate, <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>rate,</b> leaf area ratio and leaf weight ratio. In early and late spring, the highest crop growth rate was recorded for treatment 95 / 15 (11. 2 and 10. 1 g m- 2 day- 1, respectively), along with high values of <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>rate</b> (4. 4 and 6. 9 g m- 2 day- 1, respectively), leaf area ratio (0. 0095 and 0. 0103 m- 2 g- 1, respectively) and leaf weight ratio (0. 56 and 0. 56 g g- 1, respectively).

Such changes {{are believed to}} have significant effects on species performance. In subarctic coastal dune systems, Leymus mollis colonizes the embryo dunes, on the upper limit of the beach. It reaches its maximum density on the foredune, but also grows on older, stabilized ridges. This paper reports on the phenotypic variations of some ecophysiological traits associated with the persistence of L. mollis on a dune system on the east coast of Hudson Bay (northern Quebec). Leymus mollis ramets tend to have a lower <b>net</b> carbon <b>assimilation</b> <b>rate</b> and water use efficiency, and a higher substomatal CO 2 concentration on the stabilized dune than on the foredune. However, these physiological differences cannot be explained by differences in leaf morphology or nitrogen content. Under controlled conditions, ecophysiological differences observed in the field disappear, suggesting that these are not genetic but determined by environmental changes along the foredune-stabilized dune gradient.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Plant {{production}} {{is driven by}} photosynthesis. Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L., Malvaceae) is a highly productive, warm-season annual crop, with a C 3 – photosynthetic pathway. In the present work, the effect of different light intensity and temperature regimes on leaf photosynthesis (CO 2 <b>assimilation)</b> and transpiration <b>rate</b> were investigated. The gas exchange measurements took place in an open field kenaf crop in central Greece, on three days (July 11 th, August 11 th and September 8 th) {{during the summer of}} 2004, using an LC-pro portable leaf chamber. The results demonstrated that maximum <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>rates</b> of about 50 kg CO 2 ha- 1 h- 1 could be reached (at 1675 µmol PAR m- 2 s- 1), particularly at early stages of development.

Moreover, the optimum temperature for maximum assimilation increased with an increase in light intensity. Transpiration rates increased exponentially with an increase in leaf temperature at all light levels.

In particular, we tested whether episodically regenerating (ER) species, including monodominants, have higher <b>assimilation</b> <b>rates</b> at high irradiances and lower tolerance of shade than continuously regenerating species (CR). ER species had higher maximum <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>rates</b> (A(max-area)) in sun plants (9. 6 +/- 0. 4 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1)) than CR species (6. 2 +/- 0. 3 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1)) and high plasticity, typical of shade-intolerant species, but monodominant species did not differ from other ER species. CR species had leaf-level traits consistent with shade tolerance, including lower dark respiration rates (Rd-area = 0. 47 +/- 0. 03 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1); Rd-mass = 7 +/- 1 nmol g(- 1) s(- 1)) than ER species (Rd-area = 0. 63 +/- 0. 06 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1); Rd-mass = 11 +/- 2 nmol g(- 1) s(- 1)) in shade plants. Hence leaf-level assimilation traits were largely consistent with regeneration patterns, but do not explain why some shade-intolerant species can achieve monodominance...|$|R
40|$|Plants in Mediterranean {{ecosystems}} face multiple environmental stresses {{during the}} growing season. Such stresses greatly affect ecosystem function, but are poorly represented by current ecosystem models. Here, we review recent advances in understanding the responses of ecosystem photosynthesis to drought and photoinhibition. Reductions in canopy <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>rates</b> by recurrent water limitations {{during the day and}} during drought periods result from multiple limitations at the biochemical, cellular and structural levels, including reductions in stomatal, and mesophyll diffusion conductances, foliage biochemical potentials, light harvesting efficiency and modifications in canopy structure. Overall, a hierarchy of environmental effects, from instantaneous, short- and long-term influences, shape photosynthetic responses to stress in the field. The processes involved can be incorporated into photosynthesis models to different degrees, given our current understanding of each. However, fully mechanistic consideration of certain phenomena such as non-reversible, hysteretic and lagged heat and drought effects, or photoinhibition, would require the use of models including dynamic damage and repair mechanisms. We outline further model and experimental work needed to describe the parameter space for quantitative simulation of such phenomena, especially considering the need to simulate plant production under global change. 18 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Growth {{parameters}} such as leaf area (LA), total {{dry mass}} (TDM) production, crop growth rate (CGR), relative growth rate (RGR), and <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>rate</b> (NAR) were compared in six varieties of mungbean under subtropical condition (24 ° 8 ′[*]N 90 ° 0 ′[*]E) to identify limiting growth characters for the efficient application of physiology breeding for higher yields. Results {{revealed that a}} relatively smaller portion of TDM was produced before flower initiation and the bulk of it after anthesis. The maximum CGR was observed during pod filling stage in all the varieties due to maximum leaf area (LA) development at this stage. Two plant characters such as LA and CGR contributed to the higher TDM production. Results indicated that high yielding mungbean varieties should possess larger LA, higher TDM production ability, superior CGR at all growth stages, and high relative growth rate and <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>rate</b> at vegetative stage which would result in superior yield components...|$|E
40|$|Low {{phosphorus}} supply markedly limits leaf {{growth and}} genotypes {{able to maintain}} adequate leaf area at low P could adapt better to limited-P conditions. This work aimed to investigate the relationship between leaf area production of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) genotypes during early pod filling and plant adaptation to limited P supply. Twenty-four genotypes, comprised of the four growth habits in the species and two weedy accessions, were grown at two P level applied to the soil (20 and 80 mg kg- 1) in 4 kg pots and harvested at two growth stages (pod setting and early pod filling). High P level markedly increased the leaf number and leaf size (leaf area per leaf), slightly increased specific leaf area but {{did not affect the}} <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>rate.</b> At low P level most genotypic variation for plant dry mass was associated with leaf size, whereas at high P level this variation was associated primarily with the number of leaves and secondarily with leaf size, specific leaf area playing a minor role at both P level. Determinate bush genotypes presented a smaller leaf area, fewer but larger leaves with higher specific leaf area and lower <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>rate.</b> Climbing genotypes showed numerous leaves, smaller and thicker leaves with a higher <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>rate.</b> Indeterminate bush and indeterminate prostrate genotypes presented the highest leaf area, achieved through intermediate leaf number, leaf size and specific leaf area. The latter groups were better adapted to limited P. It is concluded that improved growth at low P during early pod filling was associated with common bean genotypes able to maintain leaf expansion through leaves with greater individual leaf area...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{potential}} contribution to tropical tree species coexistence of niche differentiation along light gradients has receivedmuch attention, {{the degree to}} which species perform differentially along soil resource gradients remains unclear. To examine differential growth response to soil resources, we grew seedlings of nine tropical tree species at 6. 0 % of full sun for 12 mo in a factorial design of two soil types (clay and white sand), two phosphate fertilization treatments (control and addition of 100 mgP kg− 1) and two watering treatments (field capacity and water limitation to one-third field capacity). Species differedmarkedly in biomass growth rate, but this hierarchy was almost completely conserved across all eight treatments. All species grew more slowly in sand than clay soils, and no species grew faster with phosphate additions. Only Eperua grandiflora and E. falcata showed significant growth increases in the absence of water limitation. Faster-growing species were characterized by high specific leaf area, high leaf allocation and high <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>rate</b> but not lower root allocation. Slower-growing species exhibited greater plasticity in <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>rate,</b> suggesting that tolerance of edaphic stress in these species is related more to stomatal control than to whole-plant carbon allocation. Although relative growth rate for biomass was correlatedwith both its physiological and morphological components, interspecific differences were best explained by differences in <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>rate</b> across six of the eight treatments. A suite of traits including high assimilation and high specific leaf area maintains rapid growth rate of faster-growing species across awide gradient of soil resources, but the lack of plasticity they exhibit may compromise their survival in the poorest soil environments...|$|E
40|$|Groundsel (Senecio vulgaris L.), healthy or {{infected}} with the rust fungus Puccinia lagenophorae Cooke, was grown at a range of nutrient concentrations in sand culture. There were statistically significant interactions between the effects of infection and nutrient supply upon the dry weights of stems, leaves, roots and reproductive tissues, leaf area and cumulative capitulum production. This interaction occurred since infection caused significant inhibitions of growth only at moderate or high nutrient concentrations. At low concentrations rusted plants were similar to or slightly larger than controls. Both in controls and rusted plants root: shoot ratios increased as nutrient supply declined. The ratio of root: shoot dry weight was consistently reduced by infection whilst root length: leaf area ratio was relatively unchanged. More detailed investigations confirmed that infection {{had little effect on}} plant growth under nutrient deficient conditions despite suppression of the host's ability to increase root: shoot ratios in response to nutrient stress. This reflected the inhibition of relative growth rates in rusted plants at high but not low nutrient concentrations, which in turn reflected reduced <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>rates</b> (NAR). Increases in leaf-area ratio (LAR) often ameliorated the decline in NAR in rusted plants...|$|R
40|$|During {{a period}} of 18 months {{observations}} have been made above bog vegetation in The Netherlands. The observations {{have been used to}} evaluate an assimilation model in which nitrogen shortage has been taken into account In this study we analyse observations of water vapour and carbon dioxide fluxes over bog vegetation in the Netherlands. The observations are used to evaluate an assimilation photosynthesis (so-called A-g(s)) model on the canopy scale. Next, a simple estimate for the soil respiration has been added to the A-g(s) model. Leaf sample analysis showed that nitrogen concentration was well below optimum conditions, so the A-g(s) model was adjusted appropriately. Transpiration calculations with the adjusted model result in an excellent agreement with the measurements over the bog area. The total simulated fluxes of plant assimilation and soil respiration have been compared with the measured total CO 2 flux. The agreement between simulations and experiments appears to be reasonably good. For practical applications a simplified relationship has been derived between the transpiration and the <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>rates.</b> This relation has been tested and appears to work well for practical purposes.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{long-term}} (months) exposure to low temperature (5 [deg]C) on growth, photosynthesis, and carbon metabolism was studied {{in spring and}} winter cultivars of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rape (Brassica napus). Cold-grown winter rape and winter wheat maintained higher <b>net</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>rates</b> and higher in situ CO 2 exchange rates than the respective cold-grown spring cultivars. In particular, the relative growth rate of spring rape declined over time at low temperature, and this {{was associated with a}} 92 % loss in in situ CO 2 exchange rates. Associated with the high photosynthetic rates of cold-grown winter cultivars was a 2 -fold increase per unit of protein in both stromal and cytosolic fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphatase activity and a 1. 5 - to 2 -fold increase in sucrose-phosphate synthase activity. Neither spring cultivar increased enzyme activity on a per unit of protein basis. We suggest that the recovery of photosynthetic capacity at low temperature and the regulation of enzymatic activity represent acclimation in winter cultivars. This allow these overwintering herbaceous annuals to maximize the production of sugars with possible cryoprotective function and to accumulate sufficient carbohydrate storage reserve to support basal metabolism and regrowth in the spring...|$|R
