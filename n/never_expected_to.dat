The warning was dropped after Norman made landfall the next day. No additional warnings were issued upon Norman's reemergence over water because it was <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> restrengthen.|$|E

Although Sarria <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> win He almost won {{one of the five}} available seats until city officials realised only five candidates had registered. Sarria ended up getting 6,000 votes and finishing in ninth. However the voting stunned the political community who now saw the LGBT community as a voting block with power.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{branch of}} the House of Bourbon was founded by Philip V. He was born in 1683 in Versailles, the second son of the Grand Dauphin, son of Louis XIV. He was Duke of Anjou and {{probably}} <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be raised to a rank higher than that. However King Charles II of Spain, dying without issue, willed the throne to his grand-nephew the Duke of Anjou, younger grandson of his eldest sister Marie-Thérèse, daughter of King Philip IV of Spain who had married Louis XIV of France.|$|E
25|$|The Marine Corps’ {{military}} operations in urban terrain doctrine recognizes that tactical success does not necessarily translate to strategic victory. It notes the Israeli’s tactical victory in Beirut was a strategic defeat—and observes the same about the Battle of Hue in the Vietnam War, when Marines defeated an enemy that sought {{to put up a}} good fight but <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> win. Much {{the same can be said}} of Fallujah’s defenders. In spite of the beating they took in November, they will continue to assert they repelled the initial attack and fought well thereafter.|$|E

25|$|At the meeting, Sarah Jane {{is stunned}} {{to learn that}} Kettlewell was the mastermind behind the plot; he had rebuilt K1 with Winters and Jellicoe so as to get the launch codes to force {{humanity}} to change its ways, and had feigned K1's attack at his home. K1 discovers Sarah Jane's presence, and Winters orders K1 to kill her; Kettlewell had <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> put Sarah Jane in harm and realises Winters is more vicious than he originally thought. When UNIT arrives, Winters, Jellicoe, Kettlewell, and K1 escape with Sarah Jane as their hostage. Harry, having entered the Think Tank {{under the guise of}} medical inspections, sees the group enter a bunker and warns UNIT before he is captured.|$|E
25|$|Henry {{possesses}} a diverse repertoire of musical talents. He plays the piano, violin and guitar and is well-versed in different dance forms. Henry started {{to learn to}} play the piano from his mother at the age of 5 and also learned to play the violin at the age of 6. Henry later learned to play the electric violin in 2005. Additionally, he learned a unique form of dancing called boogaloo popping while in high school. After only one year of dancing, Lau was competing in dance (popping) competitions and shows. He also achieved the Canadian Royal Conservatory of Music (RCM) Regional Gold Medal (formerly known as the Silver Medal) for Level 10 in both the violin and piano. Lau said he had planned to become a professional violinist, but <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> become an idol star before being selected by S.M. Entertainment in 2006.|$|E
25|$|NBC {{began its}} 2007–08 {{schedule}} on January 1, 2008, with the NHL Winter Classic, an outdoor hockey {{game between the}} Buffalo Sabres and Pittsburgh Penguins at Ralph Wilson Stadium. The game went head-to-head {{with some of the}} New Year's Day college football bowl games, but none of the feature Bowl Championship Series games. While <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> beat or directly compete with football ratings, the timing was designed {{to take advantage of the}} large audience flipping between channels to watch the different bowl games. It was the first such game to be televised live by an American network and the NHL's first outdoor regular season game since the Edmonton Oilers and Montreal Canadiens played the Heritage Classic, which aired on CBC, which served as the Canadian broadcaster of the 2008 Classic. Although originally maligned as a mere publicity stunt by some in the media, the 2008 Winter Classic drew a 2.6 rating in the U.S. (or about 2.9 million viewers) according to Nielsen, the highest rating for a regular-season contest since February 1996, when Fox was the league's network partner. By comparison, CBS received a 2.7 rating for the Gator Bowl, which also had a 1:00p.m. start.|$|E

25|$|The biggest {{upheaval}} in Harris' {{life was the}} disastrous 1809 Walcheren Expedition, in which a British force {{was sent to the}} islands of Walcheren of the Dutch coast with the aim of destroying the dykes and lock gates there to render the port of Antwerp unusable for the French navy. The expedition totally failed, as it was unable to take any of the island's major towns and bivouacked in squalid conditions during the summer, resulting in a plague of malaria and typhoid which killed over 4,000 soldiers and permanently disabled 12,000 from a force of 40,000. Harris was amongst those disabled, spending months in plague wards from which he was <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> recover, and on at least one occasion only surviving through the extra medical care he received thanks to his financial reserves. Although he was recalled to his regiment in 1810 for service in Spain, he was unable to attend due to recurring bouts of malaria, and spent much of the period between 1809 and 1814 in hospitals or his father's home in Stalbridge, especially after Wellington had decreed that no men who served in Walcheren were to be sent to the Peninsula as they were unfit for further service. Those few months when he was able to live normally he spent in London with Veterans Battalions of unfit and wounded men, including numerous French deserters.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after moving}} to Athens, Tryfonos {{attended}} the Athens auditions for the first season of Greek Idol. There she received all yes votes from the judges along with praise, while judge Kostas Kapetanidis predicted {{that she would be}} in the top ten. Tryfonos initially did not want to audition for the show, but did so after encouragement from family and friends, as well as after having viewed a television commercial for the show; producers called her back the next day. She had not told anyone she was auditioning besides her brother and best friend, and instead told her parents about it shortly before the first episode was set to air. Tryfonos had also previously auditioned for the second season of rival Greek talent competition The X Factor, and passed the audition phase before ultimately being cut before the live shows. In response, she later stated that {{she did not want to}} join any reality show as she did not want to be judged on anything other than her voice, but auditioned for Greek Idol as she believed it was more of a simple talent show. Throughout the competition, she was considered a favourite to win. Recalling her experience on the show later on, she stated that she thought she would make it as a finalist onto the live shows with some difficulty, but <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> win the completion. Following recall rounds and ten live shows, Trifonos came first in the competition and won a recording contract with Sony Music Entertainment Greece.|$|E

Though the men later expressed their disappointment with the outcome, Panikkar said they <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> win the competition.|$|E
500|$|Along with baseball, {{playing music}} was among Adams' {{favorite}} activities. Occasionally, he and Henry Ward Beecher performed flute duets. Although no longer {{actively involved in}} baseball, Adams was still a follower of the sport. He played in an exhibition as late as 1875, and stories exist that he played recreationally into the following decade. Late in his life, {{he said of the}} growth of baseball, [...] "We pioneers <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> see the game so universal as it has now become." [...] Adams contracted pneumonia following a bout of influenza, and died on January 3, 1899, at the age of 84. He was buried at New Haven's Evergreen Cemetery.|$|E

500|$|Dillard's {{primary reader}} for Pilgrim was a Hollins {{professor}} called John Rees Moore. [...] After finishing a chapter, she would {{bring it to}} Moore to critique. [...] Moore specifically recommended that she expand the book's first chapter [...] "to make clear, and to state boldly, what it was [...] was up to," [...] a suggestion that Dillard at first dismissed, but would later admit was good advice. [...] Previous to publication, chapters of the book appeared in publications including Harper's Magazine, The Atlantic, and The Living Wilderness. [...] Pilgrim at Tinker Creek was published by Harper's Magazine Press in 1974, and was dedicated to Dillard's husband. [...] Editor in chief Larry Freundlich remarked upon first reading the book: [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> see a manuscript this good in my life ....

Wigner professed that he had never considered the possibility that this might occur, and added: [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> get my name in the newspapers without doing something wicked." [...] He also won the Franklin Medal in 1950, the Enrico Fermi award in 1958, the Atoms for Peace Award in 1959, the Max Planck Medal in 1961, the National Medal of Science in 1969, the Albert Einstein Award in 1972, and the eponymous Wigner Medal in 1978.

500|$|Former congressman Hoeppel, who {{gathered}} just over {{one percent of}} the vote, wrote Nixon after the election, stating that he had <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> win, and that his purpose had been [...] "to expose what I considered to be the alien-minded, un-American, PAC, Red, congressional record of the Democratic incumbent". [...] Despite any hard feelings, Voorhis sent Nixon a letter of congratulations in early December 1946. Nixon and Voorhis met for an hour at Voorhis's office, and parted, according to Voorhis, as friends. In 1971, Voorhis said that the two had never spoken again. [...] Voorhis's final letter as a congressman, written on December 31, was to his father, who had been his political adviser throughout his congressional career.
