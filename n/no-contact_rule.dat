40|$|The Citizens Protection Act (CPA) of 1998 {{has always}} been a {{lightening}} rod for criticism, and it remains so today. This article reassesses the CPA’s perceived inadequacies in light of how it has actually affected (or, not affected) federal prosecutors’ involvement in criminal investigations. The article takes issue with the critics and demonstrates that the CPA succeeded where it should have, failed where it should have, and left us—however inadvertently—with a remarkably coherent and consistent approach to regulating federal prosecutors’ involvement in criminal investigations regardless of whether a suspect retains counsel early in the proceedings. The CPA requires federal prosecutors to follow state rules of professional conduct “to the same extent and in the same manner” as all other lawyers. The CPA was intended to—and did—nullify a U. S. Department of Justice (DOJ) declaration that unilaterally exempted federal prosecutors from much of the “no-contact” rule, which prohibits a lawyer in a matter from communicating with the client of another lawyer in the matter. The CPA was also intended to—but did not—require federal prosecutors to comply with various state interpretations of the <b>no-contact</b> <b>rule</b> that might have restricted their ability to participate in both covert and overt communications with represented criminal suspects. It is a good thing the CPA passed because DOJ’s assertion of authority over the <b>no-contact</b> <b>rule</b> for its own lawyers would inevitably have undermined public confidence in federal prosecutors’ commitment to fair and ethical investigatory processes. By the same token, it is a good thing that the CPA failed because broadly depriving DOJ of federal prosecutors’ involvement in communications with represented suspects would have substantially hindered criminal investigations for no good reason...|$|E
40|$|The {{questions}} whether and when federal prosecutors may ethically contact parties who have retained attorneys {{about the subject}} of the representation recently have been the focus of considerable controversy. In this note, Alafair S. R. Burke traces the history of attempts by the Department of Justice to formulate a uniform rule governing such direct communications and analyzes the regulations the Department finalized in August 1994. Ms. Burke argues that federal government attorneys should be subject to a single national standard rather than numerous state no-contact rules, and that certain limited exceptions to the rule are justified in the criminal context. She contends, however, that the new regulations are overbroad because they go beyond the legitimate needs of law enforcement by allowing most direct contacts prior to an arrest. She offers an alternative approach that would create narrow exceptions to the <b>no-contact</b> <b>rule</b> based on the special needs of federal prosecutors. Finally, Ms. Burke argues that prosecutors who violate the rule should be disciplined by state bars but that, contrary to the Second Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s holding in United States v. Hammad, courts need not suppress evidence gathered in violation of the rule...|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{new class}} in Canada called SS (street studs) where a car can run with the same {{modifications}} as a rubber to ice class, {{without the need for}} a roll bar. This same SS classing, although referred to as Super Stud or Studded class, by some American Clubs (such as the Anchorage Alaska Sports Car Lions Club) require any car running studded tires to meet at least IT rules and requires a roll cage and full safety gear. [...] Some clubs even encourage people to ice-race their daily driver, and have strict <b>no-contact</b> <b>rules</b> to allow that safely.|$|R
