He remembers that while they sat by a fire that night, they saw a near-meltdown at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. The next day, they go to the old quarry for a swim, and Homer jumps in, only to find that there was <b>no</b> <b>water</b> but only mud. However, Homer recalls that there was <b>no</b> <b>water</b> in the quarry because {{something}} was blocking the inlet pipe. When Homer unblocks it, he finds a rotting corpse in it, causing him to scream.|$|E
5|$|As Alcatraz had <b>no</b> <b>water</b> {{supply of}} its own, {{it had to}} import it from the mainland, brought by tug and barge. During the island's {{military}} years, there were in-ground water tanks and water tanks were situated {{on the roof of}} the citadel. The water tower was built in 1940–41 by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, after the island received a government renovations grant to supply the majority of the island's fresh water.|$|E

5|$|Compositional mapping and Io's {{high density}} suggest that Io {{contains}} little to <b>no</b> <b>water,</b> though small pockets of water ice or hydrated minerals have been tentatively identified, most notably {{on the northwest}} flank of the mountain Gish Bar Mons. Io has {{the least amount of}} water of any known body in the Solar System. This lack of water is likely due to Jupiter being hot enough early {{in the evolution of the}} Solar System to drive off volatile materials like water in the vicinity of Io, but not hot enough to do so farther out.|$|E
5|$|For these {{long-range}} desert operations, it {{was necessary}} for all supplies to be well-organised and suitably packaged for transportation on camels, moving with the column or following closely behind. It was vital that the soldiers were well trained for these conditions. If a man was left behind in the inhospitable Sinai, he might die in the burning desert sun during the day, or bitter cold at night. If a water bottle was accidentally tipped up or leaked, it could mean <b>no</b> <b>water</b> for its owner, for perhaps 24 hours in extreme temperatures.|$|E

40|$|AIMS—To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} probing in the initial treatment of epiphora and the symptom free period in adults with blocked nasolacrimal ducts.  METHODS—The results of probing in 85  eyes with epiphora due to nasolacrimal duct obstruction were studied retrospectively after a mean follow up of 7. 4  months (SD 11. 6) by a questionnaire and interview survey of patients.  RESULTS— 35 % of the eyes had an outcome of <b>no</b> <b>watering</b> after probing, 17 % mild watering, 35 % moderate watering, and 11 % severe watering. The patients' satisfaction (watering subjectively improved) after undergoing this procedure was 82 %, which is higher than previously reported. The mean symptom free period in eyes with <b>no</b> <b>watering</b> was 11. 25  months, in eyes with mild watering 8. 20  months, in eyes with moderate watering 5. 35  months, and in eyes with severe watering 0. 95  months. There {{was a significant difference}} (p= 0. 001) in the symptom free period between the <b>no</b> <b>watering</b> and severe watering groups.  CONCLUSIONS—Probing in adults with confirmed nasolacrimal duct obstruction can be recommended as an initial treatment procedure because of its relatively good efficacy and high patient satisfaction without compromising subsequent surgical treatment if unsuccessful.    Keywords: epiphora; nasolacrimal ducts; probin...|$|R

5|$|In {{front of}} the total failure of the attack, Shlomo Shamir ordered the retreat at 11.30 am. But this {{occurred}} on open ground under a heavy sun and the soldiers had <b>no</b> <b>water.</b> Numerous men were killed or injured by Arab fire. It was only at 2 pm that the first injured men reached the transport they had left in the morning. However, the Arab Legion didn't {{take advantage of this}} victory while, according to Benny Morris, it could easily have performed a counter-attack up to the Israeli headquarters located at Hulda.|$|E
5|$|The oppressive heat slows McTeague's {{progress}}. Schouler's {{progress is}} also beginning to wane when he spies McTeague and moves in to arrest him. After a confrontation, McTeague's horse bolts and Schouler shoots it, puncturing the water container. The water spills onto the desert floor. The pair fight one last time, with McTeague proving the victor; however, Schouler has handcuffed himself to McTeague. The film ends with McTeague {{left in the}} desert with no horse and <b>no</b> <b>water,</b> handcuffed to a corpse and unable to reach the remaining money.|$|E
5|$|Bill Pugh, {{the chief}} {{plastics}} designer at Cascelloid, based in Leicester, and former Royal Air Force pilot, created {{a prototype of}} the blown lemon-shaped plastic shaped container based upon Hack's idea sometime in the 1950s, {{as well as other}} types of blown containers. Pugh's experimented with the initial design until he was satisfied with its appearance. This plastic lemon product was then used for Hax lemon juice. Edward Hack, Ltd. produced and marketed Hax brand squeezable plastic lemon containers filled with two ounces of Sicilian lemon juice. Per Edward Hack, Ltd., the juice was unfiltered, had <b>no</b> <b>water</b> added to it, and contained a preservative to prevent spoilage. Retailers could purchase the product in packs of six bags that contained 12 squeeze packs each, totalling 72 units. Upon introduction to the marketplace, Hax juice and the plastic lemon design received some press coverage. The Hax logo used on Hax lemon juice dates back to at least 1935, at which time it was used in advertisements for Hax brand iodine pencils and Hax brand aspirin.|$|E

5|$|Burnham {{would not}} smoke and seldom drank alcohol, fearing these habits would injure the acuteness of {{his sense of}} smell. He found ways to train himself in mental patience, took power naps instead of indulging in periods of long sleep, and drank very little liquid. He trained himself to accept these abstinences in order to endure the most appalling fatigues, hunger, thirst, and wounds, so that when {{scouting}} or traveling where there was <b>no</b> <b>water,</b> he might {{still be able to}} exist. On more than one occasion he survived in environments where others would have died, or were in fact dying, of exhaustion. He was quiet-mannered and courteous, according to contemporaries. Their reports describe a man who was neither shy nor self-conscious, who was extremely modest, and who seldom spoke of his many adventures.|$|E
5|$|By 1782, the Johnsons {{had moved}} to Bryan's Station (future Lexington) in Fayette County. Johnson's mother was {{considered}} among the heroic women of the community because of her actions during Simon Girty's raid on Bryan's Station in August 1782. According to tradition, as Girty's forces surrounded the fort, the occupants discovered that they had almost <b>no</b> <b>water</b> inside to withstand a siege. Several Indians had concealed themselves near the spring outside the fort. The Kentuckians reasoned that the Indians would stay hidden until they attacked. Jemima Johnson approved {{a plan for the}} women to go alone and collect water from the spring as usual. Many men disapproved of the plan, fearing the women would be attacked and killed. However, faced with no other option they finally agreed. Shortly after sunrise, the women went to the spring and returned without incident.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{kinds of}} amphibians, which drink <b>no</b> <b>water</b> but absorb it through their {{permeable}} skins, {{have been identified}} in Petrified Forest National Park. Tiger salamanders, found in grassland and near major drainages, are the only salamander species known in Arizona. Woodhouse’s toads, which are seldom seen, are the largest toads in the park. They like grasslands, riparian corridors, and developed areas. Red-spotted toads, most active in the rainy season, July through September, are found in rocky areas near streams and in canyons. The Great Plains toad, the most common toad in the park, prefers grasslands. Resident spadefoot toads include the New Mexico, plains, and Couch's varieties.|$|E

5|$|Spines, {{which are}} {{modified}} leaves, are present on even those cacti with true leaves, showing {{the evolution of}} spines preceded the loss of leaves. Although spines have a high surface area-to-volume ratio, at maturity they contain little or <b>no</b> <b>water,</b> being composed of fibers made up of dead cells. Spines provide protection from herbivores and camouflage in some species, and assist in water conservation in several ways. They trap air near {{the surface of the}} cactus, creating a moister layer that reduces evaporation and transpiration. They can provide some shade, which lowers the temperature of the surface of the cactus, also reducing water loss. When sufficiently moist air is present, such as during fog or early morning mist, spines can condense moisture, which then drips onto the ground and is absorbed by the roots.|$|E
5|$|The {{approaching}} Turkish forces convinced Chetwode to {{call off}} the attack. But at 16:30, as the other brigades were retiring, the New Zealanders charged and captured their objective. This allowed them to bring enfilade fire onto {{the rest of the}} position. The rest of the division then resumed the attack and captured the village. By now the Turkish relief force was about two miles away to the north-east. By 17:15 all the wounded had been evacuated and the covering patrols recalled. As there were <b>no</b> <b>water</b> supplies at Rafa, at 18:30 the brigade was ordered to withdraw back to Sheikh Zowaiid. Although not as heavily involved in the battle as other units, the regiment still had twelve men dead and eighteen wounded.|$|E
5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had <b>no</b> <b>water</b> pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E
