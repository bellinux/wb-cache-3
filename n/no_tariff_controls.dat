The primary purpose of these policies has been to maintain political and economic balance. Consequently, Malaysia’s leaders have concentrated on modifying agricultural pricing policies in degrees (for example, by adjusting to fluctuating world prices) rather than in kind, and they have endeavored to keep the producer price of rice stable and thus maintain the real purchasing power of the country’s politically powerful paddy farmers; help rubber and palm oil farmers improve productivity; set taxes on rubber and palm oil levels that provide funds for public investment; maintain an economy with fairly low or <b>no</b> <b>tariffs</b> on imported consumer goods and with very low or <b>no</b> <b>tariffs</b> on imported inputs; and contribute significant amounts of the revenues obtained from export of oil to the agricultural sector.

We also show that when the transport cost is sufficiently large, both countries impose a positive tariff, which decreases the welfare of both countries. ...|$|R

50|$|They have {{historically}} served {{a key role}} in the nation's foreign trade policy. Tariffs were the greatest (approaching 95% at times) source of federal revenue until the Federal income tax began after 1913. For well over a century the federal government was largely financed by tariffs averaging about 20% on foreign imports. There are <b>no</b> <b>tariffs</b> for imports or shipments from one state to another. Since the 1940s, foreign trade policies have focused more on reciprocal tariffs and low tariff rates rather than using tariffs as a significant source of Federal tax revenue.|$|R
