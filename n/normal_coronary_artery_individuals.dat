OBJETIVO: O presente estudo investigou a influência do polimorfismo 4 G/ 5 G do PAI- 1 nos níveis plasmáticos de PAI- 1 e sua associação com DAC avaliada por angiografia coronária.

40|$|Objectives. We used {{intravascular}} {{ultrasound imaging}} of the epicardial vessels to assess coronary morphology, vasomotor response to exercise and exercise-vasomotion after betaadrenoceptor blockade {{in patients with}} syndrome X. Background. Syndrome X is defined as chest pain, abnormal exercise test results and <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> angiographic findings. Because {{of the limitations of}} coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasound was used to define coronary pathophysiology. Methods. Thirty patients with syndrome X were studied with intravascular ultrasound imaging (30 MHz, 4. 3 F catheter) of all three major epicardial vessels. Supine arm exercise was performed during coronary imaging. Lumen area was assessed at rest and during peak exercise. The exercise-imaging protocol was repeated after loading with 0. 1 mg/kg body weight of intravenous propranolol. Results. Three morphologic groups were identified using intravascular ultrasound: <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> (no plaque, intimal thickness < 0. 25 mm, n = 12), atheromatous disease (mean [±SD] area stenosis 37. 9 ± 7. 2 %, n = 10) and marked intimal thickening (0. 73 ± 0. 11 mm, n = 8). Patients with <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> displayed a vasodilatory response to exercise (+ 16. 9 % area increase); patients with abnormal <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> displayed a vasoconstrictive response to exercise (− 17. 4 % in the group with plaque; − 17. 6 % in the group with intimal thickening). Propranolol loading attenuated the vasodilatory response in the group with <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> (+ 6. 4 % area increase) and attenuated the vasoconstrictive response in the two groups with abnormal <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> (− 8. 0 % in the group with plaque; − 8. 8 % in the group with intimal thickening). Conclusions. Most patients with syndrome X have abnormal <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> by intravascular ultrasound. Intravascular ultrasound identifies three distinct morphologic groups: <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries,</b> atheromatous plaque and intimal thickening. Exercise-vasomotion is normal in patients with syndrome X who have <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> by ultrasound; patients with abnormal arteries (plaque or intimal thickening) have an abnormal (constrictive) response to exercise.

40|$|AbstractThe {{causes of}} chest pain in {{patients}} {{found to have}} angiographically <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> during cardiac catheterization remain controversial. Cardiac sensitivity to catheter manipulation, pacing at various stimulus intensities and intracoronary injection of contrast medium was examined in several groups of patients who underwent cardiac catheterization. Right heart (especially right ventricular) catheter manipulation and pacing and intracoronary contrast medium provoked chest pain typical of that previously experienced in 29 (81 %) of 36 patients with chest pain and angiographically <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> and 15 (46 %) of 33 symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In contrast, only 2 (6 %) of 33 symptomatic patients with <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease experienced their typical chest pain with these sensitivity tests (p < 0. 001). None of 10 patients with valvular heart disease but without a chest pain syndrome experienced any sensation with these tests. Cutaneous pain threshold testing demonstrated that patients with chest pain and <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> had a higher pain threshold to thermal stimulation compared with patients who had <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. No relation existed between cardiac sensitivity and cutaneous sensitivity testing. Thus, patients who have chest pain despite angiographically <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> may have abnormal cardiac sensitivity {{to a variety of}} stimuli. This increased sensitivity may be of causal importance to their chest pain syndrome or may contribute to their perception of ischemia-induced pain.

40|$|This {{case report}} {{discusses}} an unusual presentation of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> and severe mechanical complications successfully treated with surgery. An 82 -year-old man presented STEMI with angiographically <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> and no major echocardiographic alterations at discharge. At {{the first month}} follow-up, he complained of fatigue and dyspnea, and contrast echocardiography complemented by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large left ventricular apical aneurysm with a thrombus communicating by two jets of a turbulent flow to an aneurysmatic formation of the right ventricular apex. The patient underwent a Dor procedure, which was successful. Ventricular septal defects and ventricular aneurysms are rare but devastating complications of STEMI, with almost all patients presenting multivessel <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease. Interestingly in this case, the angiographic pattern was normal...|$|R
