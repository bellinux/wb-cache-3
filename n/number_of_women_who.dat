5|$|Another {{political}} issue surrounding the double burden is {{what sort of}} policies directly or indirectly affect those who do domestic work. Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant {{can be seen as}} disempowering women. Debate as to whether this is gender segregation continues. On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> do part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that there should be allowances made for women. However, there is also the argument that similar to men who fail to meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.|$|E
5|$|Issues arose {{after the}} {{erection}} of the memorial concerning the names {{inscribed on the}} Cenotaph. The committee had identified 1,793 names of Southampton men, and a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> <b>who</b> had died {{during the war and}} these had been inscribed on the Cenotaph. After the unveiling of the monument various relatives approached the committee requesting that additional names be added; after a newspaper campaign in the Southern Daily Echo newspaper, Kimber agreed to this and 203 additional names were inscribed in 1921. Another name was added in 1922, bringing the total to 1,997. More controversy surrounded the exclusion of the Jewish war dead from the memorial. Jews in Southampton had donated to the committee on the understanding that the memorial would commemorate not only Christian casualties but Jewish ones as well: one in ten adult male Jews in Southampton died during the conflict, twice the proportion for Southampton as a whole. Following the final decision on the design of the Cenotaph, however, which featured a prominent Christian cross, Jewish names were predominantly excluded from the memorial and only one Jewish name was finally inscribed on it.|$|E

It is unknown when her name began being styled as Frieda Helen Fraser. Her {{father was a}} native Ontarian who had graduated from the University of Toronto (U of T) and taught at the Upper Canada College before being appointed as a lecturer in Italian and Spanish at U of T. He prolifically wrote textbooks which {{were used in the}} provincial schools for many years. Her mother was a native of Germany and the couple's children, William Kaspar, Donald and Frieda were fluent in German and French. Fraser was home schooled until 1914, when she enrolled in Havergal College. Soon thereafter, in 1916, her father died and her brother Donald became an encouraging influence for her. In 1917, Fraser entered University College to study physics and biology. During her college years, she joined the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority where she met Edith Williams. She completed her undergraduate degree in 1922 and enrolled in medical school, earning her Bachelor of Medicine in 1925. Hers was the first class that required students to complete six years of study and had quotas limiting the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> could attend. Because few hospitals would accept women doctors for internships, Fraser went to the United States in the summer of 1925 to begin her internship at the New York Infirmary for Women and Children.|$|E

When Davidson returns to Smith Camp, he finds the entire camp burned to the ground, and all of the humans dead. He lands to investigate, and while on the ground is overpowered by four Athsheans. He recognizes one of them as Selver, an Athshean who was a personal servant at the headquarters of the colony, and later an assistant to Raj Lyubov, the colony anthropologist. A few months prior to the attack, Davidson had raped Selver's wife Thele, who died in the process, prompting an enraged Selver to attack Davidson. Davidson nearly kills him, before he is rescued by Lyubov; however, he is left with prominent facial scars, which render him easily recognizable. The Athsheans allow Davidson to leave and carry a message about the destruction of the camp back to the colony headquarters.|$|E

40|$|In the 1670 s Margaret Blagge, a maid of honour at Court {{refused to}} marry her suitor Sidney Godolphin in order to devote her life to religion. In her refusal Margaret wrote, “I will keep my Virgin, present it unto Christ, and not put myself into the temptation of loving {{anything}} in competition with my God”. The Reformation in England ended the practice <b>of</b> <b>women</b> residing in convents. My thesis investigates the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>women</b> choosing a religious life over marriage in the generations immediately following the Reformation. In this period an unprecedented rise in the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> never marry is apparent. Using the ‘Last Will and Testament’ of over one hundred <b>women</b> <b>who</b> never marry, my thesis reconstructs the religious beliefs and experiences of this marginalised group. My work puts forward a theory that a significant portion <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> never marry in {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries devote their lives to the pursuit of their religious beliefs. I develop several models for a religious life in this period, arguing, that like Margaret Blagge, these women are identifiable in society by their vows of celibacy. In order to further contextualise these changes my thesis also examines the economic basis and livelihood <b>of</b> these <b>women</b> and their experiences in the legal system, primarily the ways they constructed their own characters and actions in courts of law. I conclude that in accounting for the significant rise in <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> never marry the theory that a large portion <b>of</b> these <b>women</b> devoted their existences to religion and celibacy needs to be considered.
