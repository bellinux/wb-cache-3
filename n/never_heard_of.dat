5|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} problem Biden faced {{was the fact that}} voters did not know about him and his candidacy. An April 2–5 poll {{conducted}} by Gallup found that 38% of the public had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Joe Biden and 17% had no opinion at all about him. In contrast, 0% of the public had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Hillary Clinton and only 3% had no opinion according to a June 1–3 poll by Gallup.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, it was {{sometimes}} {{claimed that the}} original letter could be found on display at Brasenose College at the University of Oxford along with other great works in the English language. Lincoln scholar F. Lauriston Bullard investigated this claim in 1925, discovering that it was untrue and the college had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> the Bixby letter.|$|E
5|$|A September poll {{conducted}} by Clemson University found that 36% {{of the public}} had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Joe Biden and only 44% had a favorable opinion of him. However, this was the highest awareness rating in the Democratic field outside of the frontrunners (Clinton, Obama, and Edwards) and non-declared but highly discussed Al Gore. A September 18 poll found that 56% of respondents had not heard enough about Biden to form an opinion about him.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, it was rumoured that Prince Charles Edward Stuart {{and some}} of his senior Jacobite aides had escaped to St Kilda. An {{expedition}} was launched, and in due course British soldiers were ferried ashore to Hirta. They found a deserted village, as the St Kildans, fearing pirates, had fled to caves to the west. When they were persuaded to come down, the soldiers discovered that the isolated natives knew nothing of the Prince and had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> King George II either. Paradoxically, Lady Grange's letters and her resultant evacuation from the island may have prevented her being found by this expedition.|$|E
5|$|Another elite unit {{would be}} the Black Guard, a 25-man guerrilla unit under a certain Lieutenant García. García, one of Luna's favorites, was a modest but brave soldier. His unit was tasked to {{approach}} the enemy by surprise and quickly return to camp. Luna had admired García's unit very much {{that he wanted to}} increase their size. However, García declined the offer. He believed that a larger force might undermine the efficiency of their work. Jose Alejandrino, the chief army engineer and one of Luna's aides, stated that he <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> García and his unit again after Luna's resignation on February 28.|$|E
5|$|During World War II Russell Spurr was a {{lieutenant}} in the Royal Indian Navy fighting the Japanese in Burma. After the war, in February 1946, Spurr {{was part of the}} Commonwealth occupation force stationed in the Japanese naval base of Kure in southern Japan. There he noticed a huge drydock standing empty, and after querying what it had been used for, he learnt that it was where Yamato had been built. Spurr had been isolated in Burma for several years and had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Yamato, but he became interested in her story and started collecting information about the battleship.|$|E

5|$|Ireland once {{dominated}} the world's market for whiskey, producing 90% of the world's whiskey {{at the start}} of the 20th century. However, as a consequence of bootleggers during the prohibition in the United States (who sold poor-quality whiskey bearing Irish-sounding names thus eroding the pre-prohibition popularity for Irish brands) and tariffs on Irish whiskey across the British Empire during the Anglo-Irish Trade War of the 1930s, sales of Irish whiskey worldwide fell to a mere 2% by the mid-20th century. In 1953, an Irish government survey, found that 50 per cent of whiskey drinkers in the United States had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Irish whiskey.|$|E
5|$|Separated by {{distance}} and weather, the natives knew little of mainland and international politics.

5|$|An Alid revolt led by Muhammad ibn Qasim {{broke out}} in Khurasan in early 834, but was swiftly {{defeated}} and Muhammad brought as a prisoner to the Caliph's court. He managed to escape during the night of 8/9 October 834, {{taking advantage of the}} Eid al-Fitr festivities, and was <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> again. In June/July of the same year, 'Ujayf ibn 'Anbasa was sent to subdue the Zutt. These were people brought from India by the Sassanid emperors and settled in the Mesopotamian Marshes. The Zutt had rebelled against caliphal authority since , and had been regularly raiding the environs of Basra and Wasit since that time. 'Ujayf was successful in encircling the Zutt and forcing them to surrender after a seven-month campaign, making a triumphal entry into Baghdad in January 835 with his numerous captives. Many of the Zutt were then sent to Ayn Zarba on the Byzantine frontier, where they fell fighting against the Byzantines.|$|E

5|$|Lehuby's company readied a ship at Le Havre {{and began}} to gather French emigrants, of whom about 30 {{obtained}} passports to travel to Poyais. Discarding the idea of co-operation with Spain, MacGregor published a new Poyaisian constitution in Paris in August 1825, this time describing it as a republic—he remained head of state, with the title Cazique—and on 18 August raised a new £300,000 loan through Thomas Jenkins & Company, an obscure London bank, offering 2.5% interest per annum. No evidence survives {{to suggest that the}} relevant bonds were issued. The Sketch was condensed and republished as a 40-page booklet called Some Account of the Poyais Country. French government officials became suspicious when an additional 30 people requested passports to travel to this country they had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of,</b> and ordered the Nouvelle Neustrie company's ship to be kept in port. Some of the would-be emigrants became concerned themselves and made complaints to the police, which led to the arrest of Hippisley and MacGregor's secretary Thomas Irving in Paris in the early hours on 4 September 1825. Lehuby's ship never left Le Havre, and his colonists gradually dispersed.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlers}} {{were discovered}} in early May 1823 by the Mexican Eagle, a schooner from British Honduras carrying the Chief Magistrate of Belize, Marshal Bennet, to the Mosquito king's court. Seven men and three children had died, and many more were sick. Bennet informed them that Poyais did not exist {{and that he had}} <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> this Cazique they spoke of. He advised them to return with him to British Honduras, as they would surely die if they stayed where they were. The majority preferred to wait for Hall to come back, hopefully with news of passage back to Britain. About half a week later Hall returned with the Mosquito king, who announced that MacGregor's land grant was revoked forthwith. He had never granted MacGregor the title of Cazique, he said, nor given him the right to sell land or raise loans against it; the emigrants were in fact in George Frederic Augustus's territory illegally and would have to leave unless they pledged allegiance to him. All the settlers left except for about 40 who were too weakened by disease to make the journey.|$|E
