The curve of SINGLE which represents the sensing performance of SU 2 (i.e., the one with average SNR γ 2 [*]=[*]− 5 dB) is shown as reference. As can be seen, every CSS scheme works quite well through cooperation in a <b>non-hostile</b> <b>environment.</b> It should be pointed out that, although our proposed TRU D-S scheme works better than SIM D-S scheme, it is slightly worse than OPT LIN, OPT LRT, and RSE D-S schemes. However, the limited advantage of OPT LIN, OPT LRT, and RSE D-S schemes is achieved by using the average SNR of each SU in the fusion. Since no such prior knowledge is required at FC for the proposed scheme, {{it is much easier to}} implement in practice.|$|E
40|$|Too {{many girls}} and women still confront ‘No Trespassing’ signs {{throughout}} educational institutions,” read {{the introduction to the}} Report Card of Gender Equity written twenty five years after the passing of Title IX. 1 Now, forty-three years after the passing of Title IX of the Education Amendment Act, the ‘No Trespassing’ signs have not been removed. As of 1972, females can participate in federally funded education programs—but it comes at a cost. 2 A 2007 study revealed that one out of every five female college students is sexually assaulted. 3 The alarming rate of sexual assault on college campuses interferes with students’ autonomy to attend a university in a <b>non-hostile</b> <b>environment.</b> Title IX {{has the potential to be}} a powerful tool to end sexual assault on campus, or at least severely reduce the prevalence of it. However, Congress’ ability to expand Title IX may depend on its spending authority. This Comment addresses Congress’ authority to expand Title IX both before and after the Supreme Court’s National Federation of Independent Business. v. Sebelius decision...|$|E

50|$|One of {{the ways}} that {{heterosexism}} is enabled on college campuses was through heterosexist language and communicated anti-gay sentiments towards LGBTQ people. One factor that effects the college climate they experience is how they choose or if they choose to disclose their identities. Resources have been created to help promote <b>non-hostile</b> <b>environments</b> are initiatives like The Transgender On-Campus NonDiscrimination Project (TONI). TONI is an online resource center for students, faculty, and staff alike to learn about and gather general information on transgender students in higher education.|$|R
30|$|Since the {{selected}} CHs are SNs that {{are prone to}} failure and malfunction, the fault tolerance property is indispensable in WSNs, especially in <b>non-hostile</b> and harsh <b>environment</b> [20]. In order to bypass node(s) failure that is always the case in WSNs, a re-clustering strategy is proposed. To achieve fault tolerance through re-clustering, we select alternative CHs and plan the itinerary among them using MST. This way, an alternative itineraries for MAs is planned in case the first ones fail.|$|R
40|$|Background: Flagellar {{secretion}} {{systems are}} utilized {{by a wide}} variety of bacteria to construct the flagellum, a conserved apparatus that allows for migration towards <b>non-hostile,</b> nutrient rich <b>environments.</b> Chlamydia pneumoniae is an obligate, intracellular pathogen whose genome contains at least three orthologs of flagellar proteins, namely FliI, FlhA and FliF, but the role of these proteins remains unknown. Results: Full length FliI, and fragments of FlhA, FliF, and FliI, were cloned and expressed as either GST or His tagged proteins in E. coli. The GST-tagged full length FliI protein was shown to possess ATPase activity, hydrolyzing ATP at a rate of 0. 15 ±. 02 μmol min- 1 mg- 1 in a time- and dose-dependant manner. Using bacterial- 2 -hybrid and GST pull-down assays, the N-terminal domain of FliI was shown to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of FlhA, but not with FliF, and the cytoplasmic domain of FlhA was shown to interact with the C-terminus of FliF. The absence of other flagellar orthologs led us to explore cross-reaction of flagellar proteins with type III secretion proteins, and we found that FliI interacted with CdsL and CopN, while FlhA interacted with CdsL and Cpn 0322 (YscU ortholog CdsU). Conclusions: The specific interaction of the four orthologous flagellar proteins in C. pneumoniae suggests that they interact in vivo and, taken together with their conservation across members of the chlamydiae sps., and thei...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nursing {{students}} {{have to deal with}} many different clinical and practical aspects of knowledge to become skilled professionals. Student perception may be considered an indicator of teaching quality, since positive perception of students is strictly related to their effective professional learning. The Clinical Learning Environment and Supervision plus Nurse Teacher (CLES+T) scale is considered the gold standard psychometric instrument to evaluate both the quality and the climate of clinical learning environment. AIMS: To evaluate the quality of nurse teaching by means of CLES+T scale and to highlight significant correlations between CLES+T scale and selected characteristics of both students and clinical environments. METHODS: On 4 March 2013, a cross-sectional survey was conducted at University of Modena: CLES+T scale was administered during a plenary convocation to 242 nursing students who attended the second and third years of Nursing Degree. All 34 items of the scale were statistically analysed using the median test. RESULTS: The median values were uniformly represented by " 4 " level (on the Likert scale). The final marks of clinical learning experience were the only variable statistically significantly related to the scale scores. The paediatrics and emergency areas obtained the highest scale scores. CONCLUSIONS: The nursing student evaluations were uniformly positive and related to their positive final marks. A positive ward atmosphere was identified as especially important in this study. These data indicate that a <b>non-hostile</b> and hospitable <b>environment</b> can favour the best clinical learning. We conclude that CLES+T scale can be a useful instrument to explore the clinical climate in all hospital areas and to highlight critical clinical situations...|$|R
40|$|Our {{research}} {{examines the}} relationships among four factors thought to be important to new product developing organizations. Those factors include {{the speed with which}} product developers produce new products and bring them to market; the degree of integration among the various groups participating in the New Product Development (NPD) process; the proficiency with which the product developers perform their tasks; and the degree of success attained upon the completion of the NPD process. Market dynamism, or the degree of customer changeability, and market hostility, or the degree of market competitiveness, are thought to moderate {{the relationships among}} the four previously noted factors. The research questions driving our investigation include: (1) Does NPD project success vary with NPD process speed?; (2) Does NPD speed vary across innovation types (new-to-the-world products, line extensions, etc.) ?; (3) Does the strength of the relationships among NPD speed, organizational integration, NPD proficiency (overall and Fuzzy Front End [FFE]), and success vary with the degree of environmental dynamism (changing customer needs) ?; and (4) Does the strength of the relationships among NPD speed, organizational integration, NPD proficiency (overall and FFE), and success vary with the degree of market hostility (competition) ? We probed the electrical equipment, medical device, and heavy construction equipment industries to provide the data to address our research questions. Our research suggests that the speed with which projects were completed in our sample did not vary between projects that were more or less successful. We also found that the speed with which projects were completed did not vary across various product categories (new-to-the-world, line extensions, etc.) of newly developed products for the industries studied. Primarily, we found that market dynamism moderates the relationship between NPD speed and NPD proficiency whereas environmental hostility mediates NPD speed and NPD proficiency, NPD speed and organizational integration, and NPD speed and new product market success. Our data indicate that speed is not associated with NPD proficiency, degree of organizational integration, and new product success in less dynamic markets whereas speed has an inverse relationship with successfully entering new markets, the proficiency with which development and launch activities are performed, and the proficiency with which new product marketing strategies were implemented in more dynamic markets. Finally, we found that speed is inversely related to successfully entering new markets, overall NPD proficiency and organizational integration, predevelopment stage proficiency and organizational integration, and development and launch proficiency and organizational integration in <b>non-hostile</b> (competitive) <b>environments</b> whereas we found no significant relationships between these factors and speed in hostile environments. We provide several implications for both scholars and NPD managers. Innovation, market, dynamism, speed, success, competition, mediator, proficiency...|$|R
