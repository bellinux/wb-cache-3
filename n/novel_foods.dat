40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on synthetic l-ergothioneine, marketed as Ergoneine®, as a <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> submitted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 258 / 97 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The <b>novel</b> <b>food,</b> synthetic l-ergothioneine, is produced by a one-pot patented manufacturing process. Chemically, l-ergothioneine is a derivative of thiolhistidine, and it is naturally present {{in a number of}} foodstuffs such as mushrooms, some varieties of black and red beans, offal and cereals. The production process for the <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> is sufficiently described and does not raise concerns about the safety of the <b>novel</b> <b>food.</b> The information on the composition, specifications, batch-to-batch variability and stability of the <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> is sufficient and does not raise safety concerns. The applicant intends to use the <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> in quantities of up to 5 mg per serving in alcohol-free beverages, cereal bars, milk, fresh dairy products and chocolate. The applicant also proposes to provide the <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> as a food supplement, with a daily dose of up to 30 mg/day for adults and 20 mg/day for children. The target population is children above 3 years of age and the general adult population, except pregnant and breastfeeding women. Considering the NOAEL of 800 mg/kg bw per day, which was based on two subchronic toxicity studies in rats, and the maximum estimated intake levels for l-ergothioneine from all sources, the Panel concludes that the margins of safety of 470 for adults (except pregnant and breastfeeding women) and of 216 for children above 3 years of age are sufficient.

40|$|Previous {{research}} on tourist food consumption acknowledges that food-related personality traits, including neophilic and neophobic tendencies, can impede or encourage tourists to try <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> at a destination. However, the travel motivation literature advocates that tourists {{tend to be}} in a general condition of seeking novel experiences, including sampling a destination’s <b>novel</b> <b>food.</b> How food-related personality traits interact with novelty pursuits to influence tourists’ food consumption and subsequent satisfaction and travel outcomes remains unknown. The study proposes a framework of tourist food experience that leads from food-related personality traits, <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> consumption, and satisfaction to travel outcomes.

2500|$|The use of immunoinformatics tools can {{be useful}} to predict protein {{allergenicity}} and will become increasingly important in the screening of <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> before their wide-scale release for human use. Thus, there are major efforts under way to make reliable broad based allergy databases and combine these with well validated prediction tools in order to enable the identification of potential allergens in genetically modified drugs and foods. Though the developments are on primary stage, the World Health organization and Food and Agriculture Organization have proposed guidelines for evaluating allergenicity of genetically modified foods. According to the Codex alimentarius, a protein is potentially allergenic if it possesses an identity of ≥6 contiguous amino acids or ≥35% sequence similarity over an 80 amino acid window with a known allergen. Though there are rules, their inherent limitations have started to become apparent and exceptions to the rules have been well reported [...] So to make these things easier computational tools and algorithms have been actively developed to assess the allergenic potential of genetically modified food crops, bio-pharmaceuticals and various other products.|$|E

Gastrointestinal illness was induced by administering encapsulated lithium chloride (LiCI; 160 mg kg- 1 body weight) to lambs using a bailing gun. In the long-delay study, lambs were offered a <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> for 5 min. If they consumed 10 g {{or more of the}} food, LiCI was administered 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 h later.

40|$|Social {{learning}} {{involves the}} transmission of information from demonstrators to conspecifics, and {{it is expected that}} the mother is the main demonstrator in solitary species, whereas several individuals can be demonstrators in group-living species. We studied social learning about <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> in two populations of the African striped mouse, with different social systems: desert population (group-living, paternal care and natal philopatry) and grassland population (solitary, paternal care in captivity only, and natal dispersal). We predicted that both parents would be reliable demonstrators for desert striped mice but only the mother would be a demonstrator for grassland striped mice. Adults and unweaned young were assigned to one of five treatments in captivity: 1) father or 2) mother fed <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> away from young; 3) <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> fed to both adults with young present; and 4) father or 5) mother fed mouse cubes (control) away from young.

The responses of juveniles to <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> were greater (shorter latency, more sniffs) when the mother was the demonstrator, regardless of population. Mothers may be more reliable demonstrators than fathers because information can be transmitted using multiple channels (olfaction, lactation). Our study also showed that fathers were more reliable demonstrators for desert than grassland striped mice, and that responses to the <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> were greater in desert than grassland striped mice. These population differences reflect the different social organisation of the populations and the unpredictable availability of highly nutritious food in the desert...|$|R

40|$|Novel {{microbes}} {{are either}} newly isolated genera and species from natural sources or bacterial strains derived from existing bacteria. Novel microbes are gaining increasing attention {{for the general}} aims to preserve and modify foods and to modulate gut microbiota. The use of novel microbes to improve health outcomes {{is of particular interest}} because growing evidence points to the importance of gut microbiota in human health. As well, some recently isolated microorganisms have promise for use as probiotics, although in-depth assessment of their safety is necessary. Recent examples of microorganisms calling for more detailed evaluation include Bacteroides xylanisolvens, Akkermansia muciniphila, fructophilic lactic acid bacteria (FLAB), and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. This paper discusses each candidate's safety evaluation for <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> or <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> ingredient approval according to European Union (EU) regulations. The factors evaluated include their beneficial properties, antibiotic resistance profiling, history of safe use (if available), publication of the genomic sequence, toxicological studies in agreement with <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> regulations, and the qualified presumptions of safety. Sufficient evidences have made possible to support and authorize the use of heat-inactivated B. xylanisolvens in the European Union. In the case of A. muciniphila, the discussion focuses on earlier safety studies and the strain's suitability. FLAB are also subjected to standard safety assessments, which, along with their proximity to lactic acid bacteria generally considered to be safe, may lead to <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> authorization in the future. Further research with F. prausnitzii will increase knowledge about its safety and probiotic properties and may lead to its future use as <b>novel</b> <b>food.</b> Upcoming changes in EUU Regulation 2015 / 2283 on <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> will facilitate the authorization of future novel products and might increase the presence of novel microbes in the food market. </p...|$|R
