40|$|Regulations {{specify the}} maximum amount of waste that can be stored on site by a waste {{generating}} firm. When this regulatory threshold is reached, a polluting firm must move its on site waste to an <b>off</b> <b>site</b> recipient. In this setting, we analyse two questions in a stochastic framework from the viewpoints of a waste generator and a recipient that have received scant theoretical attention in the literature. First, given that <b>off</b> <b>site</b> storage is costlier than on site storage, we derive the long-run average cost incurred by a waste generating firm that stores waste both on and <b>off</b> <b>site.</b> Second, we compute the expected amount of time until the <b>off</b> <b>site</b> recipient's waste storage facility is full. ...|$|R
