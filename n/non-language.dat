5000|$|The {{temporal}} lobes {{are very}} important in the visual system {{as well as in}} the production and comprehension of language. The left temporal lobe contains Wernicke's area and Broca's area, which are both important in the production and comprehension of language.The right temporal lobe is a part of the ventral stream in the visual pathway. The ventral stream is involved in object perception and visual recognition such as faces and objects, and is therefore often referred to in relation to the McGill Picture Anomaly test. The ventral stream is often referred to as the [...] "what" [...] stream and provides a portrayal of the objects in the receptive field that ultimately aids in identifying the importance of the object.

50|$|Thinkers have {{produced}} several theories concerning how learners use their internal L2 knowledge structures to comprehend L2 input and produce L2 output. One {{idea is that}} learners acquire proficiency in an L2 {{in the same way}} that people acquire other complex cognitive skills. Automaticity is the performance of a skill without conscious control. It results from the gradated process of proceduralization. In the field of cognitive psychology, Anderson expounds a model of skill acquisition, according to which persons use procedures to apply their declarative knowledge about a subject in order to solve problems. On repeated practice, these procedures develop into production rules that the individual can use to solve the problem, without accessing long-term declarative memory. Performance speed and accuracy improve as the learner implements these production rules. DeKeyser tested the application of this model to L2 language automaticity. He found that subjects developed increasing proficiency in performing tasks related to the morphosyntax of an artificial language, Autopractan, and performed on a learning curve typical of the acquisition of <b>non-language</b> cognitive skills. This evidence conforms to Anderson’s general model of cognitive skill acquisition, supports the idea that declarative knowledge can be transformed into procedural knowledge, and tends to undermine the idea of Krashen that knowledge gained through language “learning” cannot be used to initiate speech production.|$|E
