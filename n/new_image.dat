5|$|As the DVD {{featurette}} Within a Minute illustrates, {{the film}} required 910 artists and 70,441 man-hours to create 49 seconds of footage for the Mustafar duel alone. Members of Hyperspace, the Official Star Wars Fan Club, received a special {{look into the}} production. Benefits included not only special articles, but they also received access to a webcam that transmitted a <b>new</b> <b>image</b> every 20 seconds during {{the time it was}} operating in Fox Studios Australia. Many times the stars, and Lucas himself, were spotted on the webcam.|$|E

5|$|Krusty is {{inspired}} {{to return to}} doing low-key events, where he structures a <b>new</b> <b>image</b> for himself as a stand-up comedian who tells the truth, criticizes commercialism, and refuses to sell out to corporate America. He also changes his appearance, sporting a dark sweater and tying his hair in a ponytail. Observing his newfound popularity, two marketing executives try to persuade Krusty to endorse a new sport utility vehicle called the Canyonero. Although he tries to resist, he eventually succumbs to the lure of money. After promoting the Canyonero at a comedy performance in Moe's Tavern, he is booed off stage by the patrons. He finally admits to himself that comedy is not in his blood and selling out is. The episode ends with an extended advertisement for the Canyonero, as Krusty and Bart leave Moe's tavern in Krusty's new SUV.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to drug smuggling, Noriega's associates such as Floyd Carlton and Cesar Rodríguez also eventually {{became involved with}} money laundering: large sums from drug revenues were brought in from Miami and elsewhere to Panama for laundering, and Noriega received protection payments in these instances as well. American Steven Kalish also began a large scale business selling drugs, laundering money and selling hardware to the Panamanian military for large profits with Noriega's assistance. Dinges writes that in {{at the time of}} the 1984 election, Kalish was preparing to ship a load of marijuana worth U.S. $1.4 million through Panama, for which Noriega had agreed to provide false Panamanian customs stamps to help it avoid scrutiny in the U.S.; Noriega was to be payed $1 million for this exercise. However, beginning in 1984 Noriega appeared to reduce the scale of his operations, and even ordered a raid against a cocaine factory in the interior of Panama, a raid which he then emphasized as evidence of his cooperation with the U.S. in their fight against drugs. He also ordered a crackdown on money laundering by the Colombian cartel. Noriega's <b>new</b> <b>image</b> was symbolized by his being invited as a speaker in 1985 to Harvard University, for a conference on the role of the military in Central America's wars, a speech which received a lot of attention in Panama's pro-government press.|$|E

25|$|In 1976, Frazier (32–3) fought George Foreman for {{a second}} time. With a shaved head for a <b>new</b> <b>image</b> Frazier fought well enough, {{somewhat}} more restrained than usual, avoiding walking onto the big shots which he had done in their first match. However, Foreman awaited his moment and then lobbed in a tremendous left hook that lifted Frazier off his feet. After a second knock down it was stopped in the fifth. Shortly after the fight, Frazier announced his retirement.|$|E

25|$|In 1834, the Government of Portugal {{transferred}} the sanctuary, definitively, {{to the senate}} of Caria, followed ten years later (1844), {{with the return of}} the Church's possessions to the Bishopric of Lamego, by the Court of the Exchequer. This return had the effect of reigniting donatives and decoration in the sanctuary: in 1852, the painter Carlos Augusto Massa, from Cujó, began work on several works, in 1879, the retables were re-gilded (at a cost of 374$520 réis); issues with the azulejos, which were in deteriorating conditions, were addressed; and, in 1881, a <b>new</b> <b>image</b> of Saint Anthony was purchased.|$|E
25|$|Torquay United {{went through}} various team colours before {{settling}} on the familiar yellow and blue of today. In the club's formative days they played in a light and dark blue kit, before switching to {{a black and white}} striped kit reminiscent of a modern day Newcastle United kit. This identity change led to the club being dubbed 'the magpies'. The magpies played in this colour scheme until the club opted for a fresh identity In 1954. United based their <b>new</b> <b>image</b> around the town's traditional seaside character and they chose a more distinctive yellow, or gold and blue kit. The new colours were chosen to represented the area's golden sands and blue sky and sea.|$|E

25|$|The {{buildings}} of this era reflect current attitudes toward architectural style. The International Style, with its rejection of historical tradition and its emphases on functionalism and expression of structure, {{had been in}} vogue in urban settings since the 1930s. It came late to the Carnegie campus because of the hiatus in building activity and a general reluctance among all {{institutions of higher education}} to abandon historical styles. By the 1960s, it was seen as a way to accomplish the needed expansion {{and at the same time}} give the campus a <b>new</b> <b>image.</b> Each building was a unique architectural statement that may have acknowledged the existing campus in its placement, but not in its form or materials.|$|E
25|$|The {{image is}} of a funeral {{procession}} of beings, possibly celestial, {{led by an}} angel-figure floating above the ground. The profiles of the figures suggest pre-Columbian art, and possibly an ancient Egyptian influence, as well. The angel-figure {{as well as the}} mourners have luminous peaks above their heads, in a re-imagining of halos. The shapes of the peaks are repeated by tongues of fire that point up from the bottom edge of the painting. The image strongly suggests an afterworld, {{but it is not clear}} from the image whether the environment correlates to tradition Christian understandings of heaven or hell. Xul Solar provides his viewer with a <b>new</b> <b>image</b> of an afterlife.|$|E
25|$|In If I'm Lucky (1946), her {{follow-up}} {{film for}} Fox {{when she was}} no longer under contract, Miranda was again fourth on the bill with her stock screen persona firmly in evidence: heavily-accented English, comic malapropisms, and bizarre hairstyles recreating her famous turbans. When Miranda's contract with 20th Century Fox expired on January 1, 1946, she decided to pursue an acting career free of studio constraints. Miranda's ambition was to play a lead role showcasing her comic skills, which she set out to do in Copacabana (1947, an independent production for United Artists with Groucho Marx). Although her films were modest hits, critics and the American public did not accept her <b>new</b> <b>image.</b>|$|E
