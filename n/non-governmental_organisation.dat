The primary task of capturing Tskhinvali was accomplished by the 4th Brigade with support from the 2nd and 3rd Brigades. According to the EU fact-finding mission, 10,000–11,000 soldiers took part in the war.|$|E
5|$|Nani is a {{young man}} who specialises in {{preparing}} fireworks. He is in love with his neighbour Bindu, a micro artist who runs Project 511, a <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisation</b> (NGO). Bindu also develops feelings for Nani though she does not express them. Seeking to raise money for her NGO, Bindu visits the office of a rich, powerful industrialist named Sudeep, who also finds her attractive. He befriends her, donates 1.5 million (US$ thousand), and gains her trust. Sudeep sees Nani as a rival and plans to kill him. One night, Nani helps Bindu to finish a piece of micro art—a locket made from a pencil. While returning home, he is kidnapped by Sudeep, who kills him, making his death look like an accident. Unaware of the incident, Bindu proposes to the dying Nani by telephone; it is the last thing Nani hears before he is reincarnated as a housefly that cannot remember its previous life.|$|E

40|$|Although {{case studies}} exist of the {{influence}} of <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> in international environmental negotiations, theoretical conclusions remain scattered, and the separation in previous literature between the study of environmental <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> (ENGOs) and business and industry <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> (BINGOs) reduces the generalisability of conclusions. The conclusions drawn in both fields are brought together and the resulting explanatory framework is applied to empirical material from the negotiations on reform of the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism, comparing the influence of environmental <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> and business and industry <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations.</b> The explanatory factors identified in previous research generally play out in favour of BINGOs as compared to ENGOs. The structural influence of business and industry <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> seems to have resulted in a larger influence on the outcome of the negotiations, which may be problematic from a democratic point of view as private economic interests and public interests frequently diverge...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Local <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> play an {{important}} role in the development processes of Zimbabwe. However, they face an uncertain future, as they depend on volatile external donor funding which leaves them financially unsustainable. This research sought to determine whether local <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> in Zimbabwe were sustainable, and to analyse the main factors that influenced their financial sustainability. Through a mixed methods research design including literature review, secondary data analysis and a survey using a structured questionnaire, this research revealed that local <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> in Zimbabwe were financially unsustainable. A regression analysis was employed to determine the relationships between the different factors and financial sustainability. The research focused on four factors of financial sustainability of local non-governmental organisations: sound financial management practices, income diversification, own income generation, and good donor relationship management practices. Data used for the research was from 2009 to 2013. The survey of 52 local <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> spread throughout Zimbabwe provided primary data for the research. The research confirmed findings of others that local <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> in Zimbabwe were not financially sustainable and depended on external donor funds. The research revealed that most local <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> were funded entirely by external donors, had no reserve funds, were not generating own income, and depended on average on about three donors. This meant that if the external donors pulled out these organisations would cease operations. The research revealed that on average donor dependency ratios for Zimbabwean <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> were above 93 percent, while survival ratios were very low with 22 days being the maximum. These results meant that if external donors completely pulled out their funding, local <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> would operate for at most 22 days before closing down. The research also revealed that most local <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> in Zimbabwe were not leveraging their assets to generate income, and most were not engaged in own income generating activities while their funding sources were not diversified enough to be regarded sustainable. The government of Zimbabwe was not funding local <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> and local donors were scant. The regression analysis ascertained that sound financial management practices had the largest influence on financial sustainability of local <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> in Zimbabwe, followed by income diversification, then own income generation and good donor relationship management. The research recommends that international donors should provide local <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> with some unrestricted income to support start-up of social entrepreneurship activities and small businesses to ensure the financial sustainability of the programmes they fund. The government of Zimbabwe must view local <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> as partners that complement its work and are therefore deserving of government funding. <b>Non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> need to change their mind-set, start social entrepreneurship and small business activities, and refrain from just seeing external donors as their main source of funding. Networks of <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> must fundraise to train and enhance the capacity of their member organisations in running social enterprises and small businesses, and hire staff with expertise in running profit-making activities to complement their non-profit work...|$|R
