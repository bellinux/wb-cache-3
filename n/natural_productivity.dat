5|$|From {{the time}} of British {{colonization}} of Australia in 1788, Indigenous Australians were characterised as nomadic hunter-gatherers who did not engage in agriculture, despite evidence to the contrary. In 1969, the archaeologist Rhys Jones proposed that Indigenous Australians engaged in systematic burning {{as a way of}} enhancing <b>natural</b> <b>productivity,</b> what has been termed fire-stick farming. In the 1970s and 1980s archaeological research in south west Victoria established that the Gunditjmara and other groups had developed sophisticated eel farming and fish trapping systems over a period of nearly 5,000 years. The archaeologist Harry Lourandos suggested in the 1980s that there was evidence of 'intensification' in progress across Australia, a process that appeared to have continued through the preceding 5,000 years. These concepts led the historian Bill Gammage to argue that in effect the whole continent was a managed landscape.|$|E

As such, the wetlands offered, next to hunting and fishing, optimized conditions for cattle and small scale cultivation of different crops, each having conditions for growing of their own. The agrarian transformation of the prehistoric community was an exclusively indigenous process, that ultimately realized itself only {{at the end of the}} Neolithic.

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that the longevity and low fecundity of sharks makes them particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation. Previous studies have emphasized the range of <b>natural</b> <b>productivities</b> observed across elasmobranch species and have used this to explain the sustainability of some elasmobranch fisheries and the depletion of others.

It presents modeling results which illustrate that other patterns of behaviour and interactions with fisheries may be equally or more important in determining the relative robustness of different species under exploitation. Counter-intuitively concentrating a fishery on a few year-classes of pups, juveniles or sub-adults proves to be a robust management strategy for elasmobranch fisheries as long as the means exist for protecting adults from fishing mortality. Furthermore this management strategy proves to be most effective with the least productive species with the greatest longevity. The obverse of this finding is to highlight the damaging impact on elasmobranch fisheries of human activities such as by-catch, finning, sport fishing and beach protection that cause even low levels of adult mortality...|$|R
5000|$|The Coral Triangle {{sits at a}} {{crossroads}} of rapidly expanding populations, economic growth and international trade. The biodiversity and <b>natural</b> <b>productivity</b> of the Coral Triangle are under threat from poor marine management (primarily from the coastal development, and overfishing and destructive fishing), lack of political will, poverty, a high market demand and local disregard for rare and threatened species, and climate change (warming, acidifying and rising seas). Coral reefs have experienced mass bleaching, which threaten to degrade the important ecosystems. An estimated 120 million people live within the Coral Triangle, of which approximately 2.25 million are fishers who depend on healthy seas to make a living. These threats are putting at risk livelihoods, economies and future market supplies for species such as tuna. Studies have highlighted the alarming decline of coral cover in this region.|$|E

5000|$|Lord Fax - the greedy, violent self-styled [...] "Lord of Seven Holds" [...] in Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series. Originally {{a nephew}} of Lord Faroguy of High Reaches, Fax {{was known as}} being greedy and {{ruthless}} even in his youth. He carefully conquered Hold after Hold by means of trickery, marriage, murder and force. He repressed his Holders, denied them education and encouraged them to mistrust harpers and dragonriders. At {{the height of his}} power, he controlled High Reaches, Crom, Nabol, and Ruatha, as well as three minor holds. Fax married many women, including Lady Gemma of Crom. Fax's downfall was engineered by Lessa, the orphaned daughter of the Lord Holder of Ruatha, who hid for ten years as a kitchen drudge and mentally repressed Ruatha's <b>natural</b> <b>productivity.</b> On a visit to Ruatha Hold, Fax died in a brutal fight with Bronze dragonrider F'lar, who had come to Search Ruatha Hold for potential dragonriders, but not before he had named his infant son Jaxom (son of Gemma, who was distantly related to the Ruathan bloodline) as his successor. In The White Dragon, Jaxom notices that people are willing {{to talk to him about}} his mother Gemma but never about his father Fax (perhaps fearing that he might take after Fax), and later at the uncovering of Landing Lessa compares Southern Holder Toric to Fax, remarking that they were both ambitious.|$|E

5000|$|Rent, Anderson argued, was {{a charge}} {{for the use of}} the more fertile soil. The least fertile soils in {{cultivation}} generated an income that simply covered the costs of production, while the more fertile soils received a [...] "certain premium for an exclusive privilege to cultivate them; which will be greater or smaller according to the more or less fertility of the soil. It is this premium which constitutes what we now call rent; a medium by means of which the expence (sic) of cultivating soils of very different degrees of fertility may be reduced to a perfect quality." [...] For Malthus and Ricardo this differential rent was sourced in the <b>natural</b> <b>productivity</b> of the soil apart from human influence. Anderson, however, insisted that continual improvement of the soil was possible and that the productivity of the least fertile soil could rise to a point that brought it much closer to that of the most fertile land; but also that the converse was true and humans could degrade the soil. Where fertility problems arise in agriculture, for Anderson this was a consequence of the failure to adopt rational and sustainable agricultural practices. He argued that since the land in England was farmed by capitalist farmers, this posed obstacles to rational agriculture, since the farmer tended to avoid all improvements, the full return for which would not be received for the duration of the lease.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{relative}} contribution of <b>natural</b> <b>productivity</b> and compound food to the growth of the juvenile blue shrimp Litopenaeus stylirostris reared in a biofloc system. Two experiments were carried out based on the same protocol with three treatments: clear water with experimental diet (CW), biofloc with experimental diet (BF) and biofloc unfed (BU). Shrimp survival was significantly higher in biofloc rearing than in CW rearing. The contribution of the biofloc to shrimp diet was estimated through measurement of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios in shrimp and food sources. Different isotopic compositions between feeds were obtained by feeding <b>natural</b> <b>productivity</b> with a mixture rich in fish meal and the shrimps with a pellet containing a high level of soy protein concentrate. Using a two source one-isotope mixing model, we found that the <b>natural</b> <b>productivity</b> of the biofloc system contributed to shrimp growth at a level of 39. 8 % and 36. 9 %, for C and N, respectively. The natural food consumed by the shrimps reared in the biofloc system resulted in higher gene expression (mRNA transcript abundance) and activities of two digestive enzymes in their digestive gland: α-amylase and trypsin. The growth of shrimp biomass reared in biofloc was, on average, 4. 4 times that of those grown in clear water. Our results confirmed the best survival and promoted growth of shrimps using biofloc technology and highlighted the key role of the biofloc in the nutrition of rearing shrimps. Statement of relevance In this study, we have applied an original protocol to determine the respective contribution of <b>natural</b> <b>productivity</b> and artificial feeds on the alimentation of the juvenile blue shrimp L. stylirostris reared in biofloc system by using C and N natural stable isotope analysis. Moreover, we have compared, in shrimp digestive gland, the α-amylase and trypsin enzyme activities at biochemical and molecular levels for two different shrimp rearing systems, biofloc and clear water. In our knowledge, the use of molecular tool to study the influence of biofloc consumption on digest process of shrimp was never carried out.
