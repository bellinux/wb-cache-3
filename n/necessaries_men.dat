He and his two trusted companions had been betrayed by Aila Woudiver, the underworld kingpin who had provided the <b>necessary</b> <b>men</b> and equipment in return for an extortionate amount of money.

Here the Commandant, who had been instructed to hold himself in readiness with the <b>necessary</b> <b>men</b> against the need to effect the arrest of Captain Blood, was amazed by the curious spectacle of the Deputy-Governor of Jamaica strolling forth arm in arm and apparently on the friendliest terms with the intended prisoner.

50|$|The territories {{granted to}} Alan {{encompassed}} {{most of what}} is today County Antrim and County Londonderry, stretching from Glenarm to Coleraine. The vast scale of Alan's allotment suggests {{that it was almost}} certainly a speculative grant, with little prospect that he could assemble the <b>necessary</b> <b>men</b> and resources to enfeoff and populate the area. Furthermore, his territories lay on the fringes of former Lacy power, in a region where native Gaelic power was still strong. Alan was not the only member of his family allotted Ulster lands from the English. His brother, Thomas, and his cousin, Donnchad mac Gilla Brigte, Earl of Carrick, also received grants of lands nearby.|$|R

Governor Nye approved the idea and asked General George Wright, Commander of the Department of the Pacific, for a fifty-man escort for the mission. General Wright ordered Captain E. A.

60|$|The other colony {{was that}} of Will Atkins, where there were four {{families}} of Englishmen, I mean those I had left there, with their wives and children; three savages that were slaves, the widow and children of the Englishman that was killed, the young man and the maid, and, by the way, we made a wife of her before we went away. There were besides the two carpenters and the tailor, whom I brought with me for them: also the smith, who was a very <b>necessary</b> <b>man</b> to them, especially as a gunsmith, {{to take care of}} their arms; and my other man, whom I called Jack-of-all-trades, who was in himself as good almost as twenty men; for he was not only a very ingenious fellow, but a very merry fellow, and before I went away we married him to the honest maid that came with the youth in the ship I mentioned before.|$|R
40|$|The SIMFAC {{has played}} {{a vital role in}} the design, development, and {{performance}} verification of the shuttle remote manipulator system (SRMS) to be installed in the space shuttle orbiter. The facility provides for realistic man-in-the-loop operation of the SRMS by an operator in the operator complex, a flightlike crew station patterned after the orbiter aft flight deck with all <b>necessary</b> <b>man</b> machine interface elements, including SRMS displays and controls and simulated out-of-the-window and CCTV scenes. The characteristics of the manipulator system, including arm and joint servo dynamics and control algorithms, are simulated by a comprehensive mathematical model within the simulation subsystem of the facility. Major studies carried out using SIMFAC include: SRMS parameter sensitivity evaluations; the development, evaluation, and verification of operating procedures; and malfunction simulation and analysis of malfunction performance. Among the most important and comprehensive man-in-the-loop simulations carried out to date on SIMFAC are those which support SRMS performance verification and certification when the SRMS is part of the integrated orbiter-manipulator system...|$|R

50|$|Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays (1974), by Murray Rothbard, {{takes its}} title from its lead essay, which argues that egalitarian theory always {{results in a}} {{politics}} of statist control because it is founded on revolt against the ontological structure of reality itself. The Ethics of Liberty, also by Rothbard, is an exposition of the libertarian political position. It roots the case for freedom {{in the concept of}} natural rights and applies it to a host of practical problems. For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto helped launch the modern libertarian movement in the United States, and was the first modern free market anarchist manifesto. Power and Market: Government and the Economy is another work by Rothbard in which he analyzes the negative effects of the various kinds of government intervention, and denies that government is either useful or <b>necessary.</b> <b>Man,</b> Economy, and State is a book on economics by Rothbard, {{and is one of the}} most important books in the Austrian School of economics.|$|R
40|$|The {{total cost}} of {{ownership}} of a naval ship is largely influenced by decisions made during concept design. In recent years the US Navy has undertaken numerous initiatives to reduce total ownership cost. This has prompted particular interest in reducing manning, as this is the largest single expenditure in total ownership cost. Normally ships are designed and then a study is performed to determine their required manning, but manning has a significant design impact and designs can either be too small to accommodate <b>necessary</b> <b>manning</b> or too large and costly if manning is overestimated. Manpower analysis implemented early in the design process and included in design synthesis could significantly minimize total ownership cost while optimizing ship design performance. The Department of Aerospace and Ocean Engineering at Virginia Tech has developed a Multi-Objective Genetic Optimization process to aid in ship concept exploration. This thesis describes a manning model created to be incorporated into this ship synthesis and optimization. DDG- 51 guided missile destroyer manning is used as a baseline for a guided missile destroyer (DDGx) concept exploration. ISMAT (Integrate...|$|R
