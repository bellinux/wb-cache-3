5|$|The Swiss {{government}} has been a coalition {{of the four major}} political parties since 1959, each party having a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> that roughly reflects its share of electorate and representation in the federal parliament.|$|E
5|$|The total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> in the Parliament are {{allocated}} to parties proportionally {{to the number}} of votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'Hondt method. For example, to determine who is awarded the first list seat, the number of list votes cast for each party is divided by one plus the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> the party won in the region (at this point just constituency seats). The party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat, which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat. This is repeated iteratively until all available list seats are allocated.|$|E

5|$|Although the SDP's <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> {{was lower}} than ever with the {{exception}} of the 1962 election, party leader Jutta Urpilainen was proud of her party finishing second in the election after placing third in the previous election. The SDP's support was highest in North Karelia with 26.4% of the votes and lowest in the electoral district of Oulu with 11% of the votes.|$|E
5|$|Black was {{an ardent}} {{supporter}} of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal.

5|$|In {{addition}} to political campaigning, the NSDAP engaged in paramilitary {{violence and the}} spread of anti-communist propaganda in the days preceding the election. On election day, 6 March 1933, the NSDAP's share of the vote increased to 43.9 percent, and the party acquired the largest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> in parliament. Hitler's party failed to secure an absolute majority, necessitating another coalition with the DNVP.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{the public}} commented that {{although}} some events were sold out, {{there appeared to be}} many unoccupied seats at venues, and claimed that this was because the Ministry of Education (MOE) made a block purchase of 87,000 passes to be given to schools. However, students usually did not stay for the full duration of sessions, which can be up to seven hours long. The MOE denied that students were to blame, stating that more than 95% of students allocated tickets had attended events, and that some schools had asked to purchase additional tickets due to overwhelming demand. The SYOGOC announced that once sessions had begun, unoccupied seats would be resold to people who turned up in person at venues. To enable venue managers to gauge the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> available for resale, teachers escorting students to events were instructed to inform venue managers if they intended to leave before sessions ended and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> occupied by students. On 20 August, the organisers reported that tickets were sold out for all 26 sports except girls' football.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} sale to FirstGroup closed, Greyhound began {{a program in}} select markets, where riders could reserve a seat for an {{additional}} $5.

5|$|The {{election}} gave Harper's Conservatives {{the largest}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> in the House, although {{not enough for}} a majority government, and shortly after midnight on January 24, Martin conceded defeat. Later that day, Martin informed Governor General Michaëlle Jean that he would resign as prime minister, and at 6:45p.m. Jean asked Harper to form a government. Harper {{was sworn in as}} Canada's 22nd prime minister on February 6, 2006.|$|E

5|$|The president's {{power is}} checked by a Senate and a House of Representatives, which are {{combined}} in a bicameral body called the National Assembly. The Senate is a 109-seat body with three members from each state {{and one from}} the capital region of Abuja; members are elected by popular vote to four-year terms. The House contains 360 seats, with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> per state is determined by population.|$|E

5|$|During {{the fifth}} term, 1999 to 2004, {{there was a}} break in the grand {{coalition}} resulting in a centre-right coalition between the Liberal and People's parties. This was reflected in the Presidency of the Parliament with the terms being shared between the EPP and the ELDR, rather than the EPP and Socialists. In the following term the liberal group grew to hold 88 seats, the largest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> held by any third party in Parliament.|$|E

Judiciary has been separated from the executive in all the states and Union territories except Jammu and Kashmir and Nagaland.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian {{province}} of Alberta holds elections to its unicameral legislative body, the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. The maximum period between general elections {{of the assembly}} is five years, but the Lieutenant Governor is able to call one at any time. However, the Premier has typically asked the Lieutenant Governor to call the election in {{the fourth or fifth}} year after the preceding election. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> has increased over time, from 25 for the first election in 1905, to the current 87.|$|E
5|$|The PPP and the PML-N won {{the largest}} and second largest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> {{respectively}} in the February elections. He and Sharif agreed to form a coalition government, ending American hopes of a power-sharing deal between him and Musharraf. They agreed to restore the judiciary, but Zardari took a less stringent stance than Sharif. He met with U.S. ambassador Anne W. Patterson, who pushed for a pact with Musharraf. To strengthen the new coalition, {{he reached out to}} Awami National Party, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, and Baloch nationalist leaders, who had all boycotted the elections.|$|E

5|$|The Reform Act itself did {{not affect}} {{constituencies}} in Scotland or Ireland. However, reforms there were {{carried out by the}} Scottish Reform Act and the Irish Reform Act. Scotland received eight additional seats, and Ireland received five; thus keeping the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> in the House of Commons the same as it had been before the Act. While no constituencies were disfranchised in either of those countries, voter qualifications were standardised {{and the size of the}} electorate was expanded in both.|$|E
5|$|The block {{voting system}} was used, with each peer casting as many votes {{as there were}} seats to be filled. The system, however, {{permitted}} the party with {{the greatest number of}} peers, normally the Conservatives, to procure a disproportionate <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats,</b> with opposing parties sometimes being left entirely unrepresented. The Lord Clerk Register was responsible for tallying the votes. The return issued by the Lord Clerk Register was sufficient evidence to admit the representative peers to Parliament; however, unlike other peers, Scottish representatives did not receive writs of summons.|$|E
5|$|The {{divide between}} the Dutch-speaking north (Flanders) and the French-speaking South (Wallonia) has caused the {{parliamentary}} democracy to become ethnically polarized. Though an equal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> in the Chamber of Representatives are prescribed to the Flemish and Walloons, Belgian political parties have all divided into two ideologically identical but linguistically and ethnically different parties. The political crisis has grown so bad {{in recent years that}} the partition of Belgium has been feared.|$|E
50|$|Population {{reviews of}} each electoral {{district}} are conducted before each general election, {{which can lead}} to certain districts being granted a smaller or greater <b>number</b> <b>of</b> parliamentary <b>seats.</b> İstanbul has the largest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> allocated <b>seats</b> and also the largest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> electoral districts within its provincial boundaries.|$|R

While the case of k= 2 corresponds to the classical problème des ménages with a well-studied solution, no closed-form expression for the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>seating</b> arrangements is known when k>= 3. We propose a novel approach for this type of problems based on enumeration of walks in certain algebraically weighted de Bruijn graphs. Our approach leads to new expressions for the menage numbers and their exponential generating function and allows one to efficiently compute the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>seating</b> arrangements in general cases, which we illustrate in detail for the ternary case of k= 3...|$|R
