Leonard, he declared, had owned country as wide as a horse could gallop across in a day; moreover, he had two hundred tribesmen, heads of families, who fed upon oxen killed for them--twenty oxen a week; and ten principal wives had called him husband.

The tale took about two hours to tell, and after hearing it Juanna conceived a great respect for Otter, but she saw clearly that if she wished for reliable information she must obtain it from Leonard himself.|$|E

50|$|Ideally every {{adult person}} should be married, and every married woman should have her own {{household}} and bring her own household utensils. The husband is said to technically own his wife's hut, fields, {{and most of the}} household's food, but a wise husband usually listened to the wife's advice. There was little ranking between co-wives, although seniority in terms of who was first married was at times recognized. Jealously and sorcery were common, much depending on how well co-wives got along. Unlike the Wagogo, divorce was common, a large majority of persons experiencing al least one divorce {{by the time they were}} fifty years of age, which included the return of bridewealth minus the <b>number</b> <b>and</b> <b>sex</b> of the children born. Divorce was most often accomplished by the separation of either party. Chiefdom courts found certain reasons to automatically justify divorce: a woman's desertion, being struck by a wife, the wife's adultery, sexual refusal of the wife, and having an abortion, were all adequate reasons. Grounds for a husband to claim divorce were failure of the wife to carry out household duties, visiting a doctor without permission, and possible infertility. A wife could divorce if the husband deserted for a period of time without supporting her; if the husband seriously injured her by, for example, breaking a limb, but not simply beating her; the husband's impotence or perversions; or if her husband generally failed to maintain her and her children properly. A husband's adultery would not be one of the grounds.|$|E

Management efforts to preserve this population require {{a comprehensive knowledge}} of the <b>number</b> <b>and</b> <b>sex</b> of the remaining individuals and their respective home ranges. This goal has been achieved {{using a combination of}} noninvasive genetic sampling of hair and faeces collected in the field and corresponding track size data. Genotypic data were collected at 24 microsatellite loci using a rigorous multiple-tubes approach to avoid genotyping errors associated with low quantities of DNA. Based on field and genetic data, the Pyrenean population was shown to be composed at least of one yearling, three adult males, and one adult female. These data indicate that extinction of the Pyrenean brown bear population is imminent without population augmentation. To preserve the remaining Pyrenean gene pool and increase genetic diversity, we suggest that managers consider population augmentation using only females. This study demonstrates that comprehensive knowledge of endangered small populations of mammals can be obtained using noninvasive genetic sampling...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{the impact of}} siblings on the education {{of men and women}} born in the United States between 1920 and 1965. We examine the effect of the <b>number</b> <b>and</b> <b>sex</b> composition of a boy or girl's siblings on that child's educational attainment. We find that throughout the century women's educational choices have been systematically affected by the sex composition of her siblings, and that men's choices have not. Women raised only with brothers have received on average significantly more education than women raised with any sisters, controlling for household size. Since sibling sex composition affects women's educational attainment and plausibly may be unrelated to other determinants of earnings, it may provide a useful instrument for education in earnings functions for women. Our results suggest that standard estimates significantly underestimate the return to schooling for women.

The typical BSA-specific IgM responses followed by IgG responses to the primary immunization were boosted by the secondary immunization. The kinetics of these responses were not altered by l-carnitine treatment. However, BSA-specific total Ig and IgG, but not IgM, responses were significantly increased by dietary l-carnitine supplementation, after both the primary and the secondary immunization.

Karyotypes of 16 {{species of the}} family Eresidae as well as 2 species of the other families of the superfamily Eresoidea, Hersiliidae and Oecobiidae, are presented. Furthermore, DNA content and base proportion was determined in 14 species. In two species, DNA content of sex chromosomes was also measured. Obtained results revealed considerable variability of diploid <b>numbers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sex</b> chromosomes systems in eresids. Obtained karyotype data allow to divide eresids into four groups.

Karyotypes of S. lineatus and E. annulipes differ substantially from other representatives of the genera Stegodyphus and Eresus which indicates paraphyly of these genera.
