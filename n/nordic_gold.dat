50|$|The <b>Nordic</b> Folkboat <b>Gold</b> Cup is a sailing race in Nordic Folkboat held {{annually}} in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, or Germany. The cup is subject for competition between yacht clubs competed in regular fleet racing style with individual crew. If any yacht club manages {{to win the}} cup for six times, the club wins it to keep it forever. It has been conquered forever three times, by Kjøbenhavns Amatør-Sejlklub in 1974 and by Kerteminde Sejlklub in 1982 and 1994. Luckily both yacht clubs have donated the cup back to continue {{the tradition of the}} prestigious cup. With the lack of a World Championships, the Gold Cup is the most prestigious event in the class.|$|R

50|$|Alloys {{similar to}} {{aluminium}} bronze {{are used in}} making coins, for example the 20, 200 and 500 Italian Lire, the one and two dollar coins of Australian and New Zealand currency produced by the Royal Australian Mint, some Mexican coins and the <b>Nordic</b> <b>gold</b> used for some Euro coins. The Canadian 2 dollar coin, produced by the Royal Canadian Mint and circulated since 1996, is a bi-metallic piece with an outer ring of nickel-plated steel and an inner circle of Aluminium bronze composed of 92% copper, 6% Aluminium, and 2% nickel (also known as Bronzital).|$|E
50|$|Finland, like {{no other}} country in the union, has a {{tendency}} to use mainly silver in their collectors' coin issues and a very distinctive way of alternating other materials, like gold, nickel-copper, <b>Nordic</b> <b>gold,</b> etc. They have minted more bimetal collectors' coins than gold coins. That is the main reason why {{the vast majority of the}} Finnish coins have a low face value, with almost 70% of their issues having a face value of €10 or €5. As a result, the Finnish gold coins have a really high value in the market because they are fairly difficult to find.|$|E
25|$|The flag of Sweden is the {{national}} flag of the Kingdom of Sweden. It consists of a yellow or <b>gold</b> <b>Nordic</b> Cross (i.e. an asymmetrical horizontal cross, with the crossbar closer to the hoist than the fly, with the cross extending {{to the edge of}} the flag) on a field of blue. The Nordic Cross design traditionally represents Christianity. The design and colors of the Swedish flag are believed to have been inspired by the present coat of arms of Sweden of 1442, which is blue divided quarterly by a cross pattée of gold, and modeled on the Danish flag. Blue and yellow have been used as Swedish colours at least since King Magnus III's royal coat of arms of 1275.|$|R
5|$|Georg Hackl of Germany {{finished}} in {{second in the}} men's luge singles event, becoming the first athlete to win a medal at five consecutive Games in the same individual event. The United States teams, in the four-man bobsleigh event, won the country's first bobsleigh medals in 46 years. The 2002 Games also saw the first Winter Olympics gold medalists of African origin: Vonetta Flowers of the United States in the women's bobsleigh event, and Canada's Jarome Iginla in men's ice hockey. The Games were affected by doping problems; four medalists were stripped of their medals {{as a result of}} doping disqualifications. Additionally, a judging scandal in figure skating led to the declaration of joint Olympic champions in the pairs event. Ole Einar Bjørndalen was the Games' most decorated athlete, winning four gold medals; Janica Kostelić was the best-performing female athlete with three golds and a silver medal. Finnish athlete Samppa Lajunen became the first person to win three <b>Nordic</b> combined <b>gold</b> medals at a single Olympics, while Simon Ammann of Switzerland, who had not won a FIS Ski Jumping World Cup event before the Games, was the surprise performer, winning the gold medal on both the normal and large hills.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. {{finished}} {{fifth in}} the gold and seventh in the overall medal count. While the United States' total medal count was down from the 2002 Winter Paralympics {{because the number of}} disability classes in both alpine and nordic skiing were significantly reduced, there were many standout U.S. performances. Steve Cook won three medals in <b>nordic</b> skiing, including <b>gold</b> in the men's standing category of the 5K and the 10K. In alpine skiing, Laurie Stephens won three medals in the women's sitting category, including gold in the downhill and super G, while in the men's downhill, Kevin Bramble won gold in the sitting category and his teammate Chris Devlin-Young took the silver. Allison Jones and Sandy Dukat won gold and bronze, respectively, in the women's standing category of the slalom. Stephani Victor was the gold medal winner in the women's sitting slalom. The U.S. sledge hockey team was unable to repeat its gold medal from the 2002 Winter Paralympics after losing 4-2 to Norway in the semifinals, but held on to win the bronze by beating Germany 4-3.|$|R
50|$|After quitting racing, Ina Scot {{started her}} new {{career as a}} {{breeding}} mare. Her first offspring, Ambassadeur Brunn, was born in April 1998 before Ina Scot was purchased by German Michael Schröer. During her years in Germany, {{she gave birth to}} <b>Nordic</b> <b>Gold</b> November (b. 2000), Oscar November (b. 2001) and Paul November (b. 2002, finalist in the Swedish Trotting Derby 2006). In August 2007, the Italian-born colt Michael November was the most expensive among 63 one-year-olds sold at a horse sale in the Netherlands, costing €66,000. At this time, it was reported that Schröer had sold Ina Scot to Dutch real estate broker Ger Visser.|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps {{best known}} is the Kraftkar blue cheese that became World Champion in World Cheese Awards 2016.

40|$|The {{analytical}} {{study of}} infra red femtosecond laser induced particles has been performed using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Low Pressure Impaction (ELPI). Various natural and synthetic matrices have been tested: monazite (phosphate), zircon (silicate), NIST 610 (glass), spinel (oxide), quartz (silicate structure), silicon (semiconductor) and <b>Nordic</b> <b>gold</b> (metallic alloy). Three types of particles are systematically observed: very rare large round spherical particles (d(p) approximate to 1 mm) whose composition {{is close to}} the initial sample, spherical particles of smaller size (d(p) <= 250 nm) and agglomerates of d(p) approximate to 10 nm particles. Chemical compositions of the latter two are complementary with respect to the ablated sample. Isolated occurrence of hydrodynamic sputtering may explain the creation of rare large droplets. Other particles are probably generated from the irradiated matter in the supercritical state during the cooling process and plasma expansion. A recent model provides a strong basis to describe vapour to particle conversion and further condensation/coalescence processes for simple systems (single component). Additional assumptions must be included to apply the model to our observations of complex multi-elemental systems. A qualitative interpretation may be proposed on the basis of fractionated condensation/coalescence and further agglomeration of particles, depending on plasma pressure and the ablated elements properties (mainly density and melting period) as well as the thermal evolution of the plume. This interpretation is discussed and validated for each sample type. Previous results concerning ablation mechanisms using the same system are included in our model. The generation of particles from a vapour phase confirms that vaporization is the main ablation mechanism in the femtosecond regime. Moreover, the possible presence of molecular sized clusters in the initial plasma, which can accelerate the nucleation process, strongly suggests that fragmentation is the secondary ablation mechanism. Finally, the present study is an experimental validation for recent femtosecond laser ablation simulation, and it brings new insights for interpreting particles generation processes for complex systems. Correlations between laser ablation ICP-MS measurements must now be made with the present results...|$|E
