We assessed {{the impact of a}} pilot dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) programme on reducing trauma-related symptoms and improving emotional regulation, suicidality, and NSSI in adolescents. Methods. Six adolescents attending a community mental health service received 26 weeks of DBT, together with a parent. Independent assessors collected measures on each participant at baseline, posttreatment, and three-month followup. We implemented further improvements over past research with the use of adolescent-specific outcome measures as well as independent assessment of treatment integrity, <b>noted</b> as <b>problematic</b> in previous studies, using videotapes. Results. Firstly, adolescents reported a decrease in trauma-based symptoms, suicidality, and NSSI following participation in the DBT programme that was maintained at the three-month followup. Secondly, adolescents also reported improved emotion regulation immediately following treatment, and this was maintained, albeit more moderately, three months later. Given the burgeoning demand on mental health services, it is notable that five of the six adolescents were discharged from the service following the DBT intervention. Conclusions. The results of this pilot programme suggest that DBT has the potential to improve the symptoms of this at-risk population...|$|R

Overall, while <b>noting</b> various <b>problematic</b> areas for the business community, and the usual uncertainties in any medium- to long-term forecasting exercise, we remain broadly confident that Russia's economy will continue to grow quite rapidly, and that the opportunities for foreign investors in an increasingly wide range of branches will steadily expand.

40|$|Historically {{students}} from Latin American countries {{participating in the}} secondary-level, cross-cultural homestay exchange program of Youth for Understanding (YFU) have failed to complete the exchange at a rate significantly {{greater than that of}} other students. Differences in gender stereotypes and gender role expectations between Latin America and the USA were hypothesized to be a factor in this. Fifty-three adolescent Latin American and West German students in the YFU program participated in this longitudinal study to (1) determine the influence of similarity of gender stereotypes between USA host parents and exchange student on student functioning, (2) test the effect of an orientation program focusing on gender role expectations in the USA and using a modified cultural assimilator format on student functioning, and (3) determine what issues in the area of gender stereotypes and gender roles were problematic for the students. Criterion variables for Questions 1 and 2 were (1) ratings of student functioning in the exchange by YFU Area Representatives and (2) rate of referral to the counseling service. Question 3 was investigated using a semi-structured interview format. Results showed that (1) student/host parent gender stereotype compatability was not a factor in student functioning; (2) the orientation program was effective in improving the functioning of Latin American students on Criterion 1 at 3 ̆c. 75 and Criterion 2 at 3 ̆c. 02; and (3) concerns <b>noted</b> as <b>problematic</b> were specific to the culture of the student and were focused on behavioral aspects of gender role issues.

Inspection of the correlation matrix revealed no inter-item correlation exceeding r[*]=[*] 0.8, thus indicating no problems with multicollinearity within the data. Item 12 ‘experience of fluorescein angiogram’ was <b>noted</b> as potentially <b>problematic</b> with all correlations <[*] 0.2.

40|$|Fundamental to the {{principle}} of justice is the notion of ‘equality’, equality before the law, equal opportunities, etc., aligned with which are various spatial metaphors, e. g. ‘level playing field’. The space of justice is thus in significant ways a space without qualities, abstract, neutral, balanced and disinterested in its formal groundings. These qualities of social discourse, however, engage the spatial metaphor materially through architecture and the discourse of architecture through aesthetics. The space of justice becomes the space of the theatre of the public realm. The space of the city. This paper seeks to identify the origins of this set of correlations and translations {{in the development of the}} concept of space in the neoclassical Western tradition. It proposes a set of qualitative distinctions that characterise its developmental structure as symbolic language, imaginary identity, and ineffable potency, <b>noting</b> the explicit <b>problematic</b> posed for this tripartite construct by the advent of Modernism.

[...] Theologie der Auferstehung was his manifesto on the subject, and he updated it many years later, with {{a chapter on}} eschatology and the aeon of aeons, {{as well as more}} arguments aimed at Bultmann. He also included a new, need discussion on the nature of Time (something Augustine had <b>noted</b> as <b>problematic</b> long ago), in which (predictably) he rejected the dichotomy between eternity and earthly time: [...] "This positing of an exclusive antithesis between time and eternity makes impossible any union of the eternal God with temporal man" [...] (p.182).

30|$|In Section 2.2, it {{was noted}} that Borjas (2017 a, b) had found wages of the least-skilled Miami workers to be {{negatively}} impacted following the Mariel shock. If his findings are correct, one would expect fertility responses of natives to differ also by skill level (since perceptions of job security and wages ought to be differently affected for low-skilled and high-skilled women). In particular, we would expect fertility effects to be concentrated on low-skilled women. Although it would be insightful to test as well if heterogeneous impacts exist across skill levels, this is not possible in practice. This is because of the tiny sample sizes which result when the sample is split by skill level. To see this, consider that, on average, there are only around 24 women age 25 to 44 with less than high school education (high school dropouts) in Miami each year. Sample sizes this small mean that fertility impact estimates would be very noisy. Statistical inference would therefore be <b>problematic.</b> <b>Note</b> that when analysing heterogeneity by skill level, a modification needs to be made to the age restriction of the sample. In particular, the lower bound of the age restriction should be increased from 15 (to something like 25). This is to ensure that only women who would be old enough to have had a choice between completing or dropping out of high school are analysed.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{ethnography}} {{of the phenomenon}} of self-help. It begins by <b>noting</b> a <b>problematic</b> at {{the centre of the}} topic: the term self-help connotes, on the one hand, an autonomous agent ("self'), and on the other, a reliance on other agents ("help"). More substantively, the term attaches itself to two opposing ideological positions, individualism and collectivism. This strange splitting of the term is reproduced in a contemporary context, where we see the genre of self-help books, which is built around the highly individualistic activity of reading as a quest for self-help, and self-help groups, which are built around the collective, co-presence of members as they mutually help one another. But the phenomenon is engaged by separate, non-overlapping literatures that treat self-help books as having a status independent of self-help groups; one attends to self-help books, but disregards self-help groups, while the other attends to self-help groups, but disregards self-help books. Thus self-help books and self-help groups get polarized. This effectively makes the original problematic around the term itself disappear, because it' simply ignores it. This research turns this character of self-help into a topic for study. It looks at what holds the term together, that is to say, self-help books and self-help groups, when they appear to be entirely independent phenomena, and yet still share the term self-help. It is interested in the significance of the term, why it gets invoked as a description of particular activities and what that entails as a practical matter. It wants to see how self-help is performed. It identifies a hybrid of self-help books and self-help groups - a self-help workshop. This third site of self-help brings individual readers of self-help books into a context of collective, social activity. It uses this as a strategy with which to examine the relationships between self-help books and self-help groups, self and help. It undertakes a detailed empirical analysis of a corpus of self-help books, a selfhelp workshop and a range of self-help groups, drawing on textual, discursive and ethnographic modes of inquiry. It then uses this empirical work to map self-help and engage it as a wider, cultural phenomenon in the modem period. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

As Pernoud and Clin note, [...] "That trial was now a symbol of complex cultural fissures in search of closure: of the internal fractures of a riven France, of national splits enervated by English invasion, and of religious and civil power struggles sustained by the University of Paris." [...] The rehabilitation trial focused strongly on the transvestism charge, which Pope Pius II <b>noted</b> was <b>problematic.</b> Individuals testifying during the trial stressed the necessity of her dress, both for means of keeping order in her troops in battle and for protecting her chastity. As the trial noted, she wore [...] "long, conjoined hosen, attached to the aforesaid doublet with twenty cords (aiguillettes)" [...] and [...] "tight leggings", with the cords being used to securely tie the parts of the garment together so her clothing couldn't be pulled off by the English guards. Guillaume Manchon testified, [...] "And she was then dressed in male clothing, and was complaining that she could not give it up, fearing lest in the night her guards would inflict some act of sexual outrage upon her," [...] a claim backed up by a number of other witnesses. The same justification was given for her relapse by a number of witnesses, such as Friar Martin Ladvenu, Pierre Cusquel, Giullaume Manchon, and Friar Isambart de la Pierre, although a number of others, such as Jean Massieu, Pierre Daron, and Guillaume Colles, alternatively claimed that she was entrapped into wearing male clothing by a guard who took away her female clothing). Jean Moreau testified that he had heard Joan reply to the preacher that she had adopted male clothing during her campaign because she had to live among soldiers, among whom it was more appropriate for her to be in male, rather than female clothing. The court ruled that [...] "nothing improper has been found in her, only good humility, chastity, piety, propriety, simplicity." ...|$|R

The article contends that these permutations on the state competition debate do not provide a satisfactory positive explanation of the behavior or the influence of the states and federal government.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine a new conceptual framework for the readjustment process using existing loss and grief models. This study examined nine variables associated with the grieving process (Despair, Anger/Hostility, Guilt, Social Isolation, Loss of Control, Rumination, Depersonalization, Death Anxiety and Somatization) and applied them to the cross-cultural transition of American Field Service (AFS) high school exchange students back into New Zealand after one year abroad. 207 sojourners responded to mail-in questionnaires measuring grief (Grief Experience Inventory; GEI) and psychological adjustment (the short form of the Profile of Mood States; POMS-SF). Their responses on the POMS-SF were compared to that of a home based control of high school students while responses on the GEI were compared with three reference groups and a control group from the GEI manual. Results suggest sojourners are more similar to people grieving after a death than people experiencing loss by divorce. While sojourners were typically satisfied with their exchange, 61 % <b>noted</b> re-entry was <b>problematic.</b> Further support for the results came from the unsolicited qualitative information participants provided.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} the Distress Thermometer in an Australian population using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) as the criterion measure for case detection. Patients and methods: A cross-sectional survey of 439 cancer patients (61. 2 % response) under current medical care at a regional tertiary cancer centre was undertaken. Assessments included general distress, anxiety and depression, general health and well-being, cancer-specific distress, social support, and social constraints. The screening properties of the Distress Thermometer were evaluated against cases identified using the full-scale scores of the HADS as has been done previously. In addition, we used the separate scores on the depression and anxiety scales to {{evaluate the}} utility of the Distress Thermometer in detecting cases of anxiety only, depression only, and depression and anxiety together. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of the Distress Thermometer with the HADS full scale were found to be similar to that of previous research. Use of the sub-scale scores of the HADS to detect cases led to some differences in the Distress Thermometer performance. In particular, detection of cases of depression only was quite poor. The positive predictive value (PPV) of the HADS generally and specifically was <b>noted</b> to be <b>problematic.</b> Conclusions: Although we obtained similar results to previous research, our results suggested that caution may need to be exercised when using the Distress Thermometer as a screening instrument. It may not be as effective a screen for depression symptoms and has a high rate of false positives. No Full Tex...|$|R
5000|$|The Kitáb-i-Aqdas was {{completed}} by Bahá'u'lláh in 1873. It {{was published in the}} Arabic for circulation among Bahá'ís speaking the language circa 1890. A Russian translation was undertaken by Alexander Tumansky in 1899 and was his most important contribution to Bahá'í studies. Around 1900 an informal English translation was made by Bahá'í Anton Haddad, which circulated among the early American Bahá'í community in a typewritten form. In 1961, an English scholar of Arabic, Dr. Earl E. Elder, and William McElwee Miller, an openly hostile Christian minister, published an English translation, [...] "Al-Kitab Al-Aqdas", through the Royal Asiatic Society, however its translation of the <b>notes</b> section was <b>problematic</b> and overall lacked [...] "poetic sensibility, and skill in Arabic translation". Indeed, Miller only ever used it to further his polemical agenda. In 1973 a [...] "Synopsis and Codification" [...] of the book was published in English by the Universal House of Justice, with 21 passages of the Aqdas that had already been translated into English by Shoghi Effendi with additional terse lists of laws and ordinances contained in the book outside of any contextual prose. Finally, in 1992, a full and authorized Bahá'í translation in English was published. This version is used as the basis of translation into many other languages highlighting the practice of an indirect translation and how the purpose of the translation affects the act of translation. The Bahá'í Library Online provides a side-by-side comparison of the authorized translation with earlier translations of Anton Haddad and Earl Elder.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{provides an}} outline of the topics to be considered during the two days of lectures I will be giving on evaluation design and methods as they apply to various types of so-cial programs and/or organized interventions into communities and targeted populations. My lec-tures are intended to provide an introduction to issues that one needs to confront in designing an evaluation of some program or intervention {{and the range of}} options available to address these issues. I will focus on three issues: Experimental Evaluation Designs, Non-Experimental Evalua-tion Designs and Process Analysis. Even though the prospects of using an experimental design may be remote, I will treat experimental designs because it provides a useful contrast between ideal evaluation designs and the practical problems in social contexts which the feasibility of ex-perimental evaluations <b>problematic.</b> <b>Note</b> that I will not cover cost-benefit analysis in my lec-tures, even though it is often a focus of evaluations. I have omitted it because I suspect the Bank’s Research Division already has expertise in this area and/or can find experts who are more versed in this area than I. Below, I provide a preliminary reading list of background material for these lectures. I have “* ” those readings which you might want to look at in advance of the lectures. I will at-tempt to structure most of my lectures so that they do not depend upon your reading specific pieces.

40|$|Cartoon {{images are}} often stored as pixel-based, raster data. This format {{is not the}} most {{appropriate}} for representing cartoon images that are initially drawn as geometric areas of colour. Raster images cannot be scaled without creating pixelisation artefacts and modification of such images must be performed pixel by pixel. A vector-based representation is a more suitable format for storing cartoon images. This thesis investigates a novel process for converting colour raster images into colour vector images. The process has been refined to facilitate the conversion of colour cartoon images, natively stored as raster data, into a scalable vector representation consisting of areas of uniform colours. The process is composed of a number of stages which are reviewed in some detail. These include; colour quantisation, colour decomposition, shape outlining, path tracing, path simplification, rendering and storage. An investigation into the use of colours in different types of images has been performed and used to improve the colour quantisation stage of the process which was <b>noted</b> to be <b>problematic.</b> Using the enhanced colour quantisation scheme together with additional novel optimisations an efficient colour area-based vectorisation system has been produced. The system has been extended to process multiple sequential images to support efficient conversion of cartoon video sequences into scalable vector animation. The developed colour area-based vectorisation system has been applied to a database of raster cartoon images. The generated vector representation is shown to offer a number of benefits including reduced storage requirements, the ability to render at higher resolutions without creating pixelation artefacts and simplified image manipulation for future modifications.

40|$|The {{waveform}} for Blazhko stars can {{be substantially}} different during the ascending and descending {{parts of the}} Blazhko cycle. A hybrid model, consisting of two component oscillators of the same frequency, is proposed {{as a means to}} fit the data over the entire cycle. One component exhibits a sawtooth-like velocity waveform while the other is nearly sinusoidal. One method of generating such a hybrid is presented: a nonlinear model is developed for the first overtone mode, which, if excited to large amplitude, is found to drop strongly in frequency and become highly non-sinusoidal. If the frequency drops sufficiently to become equal to the fundamental frequency, the two can become phase locked and form the desired hybrid. A relationship is assumed between the hybrid mode velocity and the observed light curve, which is approximated as a power series. An accurate fit of the hybrid model is made to actual Kepler data for RR Lyr. The sinusoidal component may tend to stabilize the period of the hybrid which is found in real Blazhko data to be extremely stable. It is proposed that the variations in amplitude and phase might result from a nonlinear interaction with a third mode, possibly a nonradial mode at 3 / 2 the fundamental frequency. The hybrid model also applies to non-Blazhko RRab stars and provides an explanation for the light curve bump. A method to estimate the surface gravity is also proposed. Comment: No major changes. Emphasizes the ability of the hybrid mode to explain changes in the pulsation waveform throughout the Blazhko cycle that may otherwise be <b>problematic.</b> <b>Notes</b> that first-overtone/fundamental combination is just one possible means to generate the hybrid and suggests alternatives.
