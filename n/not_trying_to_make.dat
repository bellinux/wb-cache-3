500|$|Mulder's {{dream and}} {{decisions}} in [...] "The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati" [...] heavily allude to {{the actions of}} Jesus in Nikos Kazantzakis's novel The Last Temptation of Christ. Duchovny, {{a fan of the}} book, found parallels between its central story and Mulder's ordeal, and incorporated many of the novel's concepts into the episode. In The Last Temptation of Christ, Jesus is torn between his higher calling as the son of God and his desire towards his own humanity. Duchovny was drawn to the fact that Christ's struggle in the novel was [...] "not only godlike, but also profoundly human" [...] and used this template for Mulder; in the series, Mulder is destined towards greater things—in this case, stopping the oncoming alien invasion—but he also desires to have a personal life. Duchovny noted that [...] "Mulder is a guy who's been given the same problem [...] What I'm doing is using the very human model of Christ". Duchovny cautioned that he was <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Mulder into a Christ-like savior figure but rather [...] "an everyman". Executive producer Frank Spotnitz described the concept as a risk, but Duchovny felt that this exploration of Mulder's character was important to the series.|$|E
500|$|In November 1996, Björk {{released}} the [...] "often-delayed" [...] remix project Telegram, which contained reworkings of several songs from Post, with her voice re-recorded. Telegram {{has been described}} as [...] "effectively a completely new album". Author Mark Pytlik writes, [...] "Promises of a Post remix album had been circulating since the release of [...] "Army of Me" [...] in April 1995. To compensate, Björk announced the release of a string of 12" [...] remixes beginning in June, limited to only 1,000 copies each. Producers and musicians featured on Telegram include: Dillinja, Eumir Deodato, LFO, and Graham Massey, among others; Björk only remixed [...] "You've Been Flirting Again" [...] herself. The album also contains a new composition, [...] "My Spine", a collaboration with British percussionist Evelyn Glennie. According to CMJ New Music Monthly, musically the album contains [...] "a real and surprising taste for recent trends in dance music". Regarding the release, Björk said: [...] "It's like the core of Post. That's why it's funny to call it a remix album, it's like the opposite. [...] Telegram is more stark, naked. <b>Not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it pretty or peaceable for the ear. Just a record I would buy myself". The singer also declared that the release of Telegram meant {{the end of an era}} consisting of Debut and Post. At the release of the compilation, Björk was already relocating to Spain to produce her next studio album solely by herself. The compilation was well received by music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote, [...] "Telegram works as an excellent introduction to techno for alternative pop fans unsure of where to begin exploring." [...] Douglas Wolk of CMJ New Music Monthly felt the music of Telegram was [...] "actually better than Post", describing the tracks as, [...] "well-considered reworkings". The Rolling Stone Album Guide gave the album three and a half stars, and stated it, [...] "shed new light on the songs". Telegram spent five weeks on the Billboard 200 chart, peaking at the 66th spot. In the UK, it peaked at the 59th spot, spending two weeks in the albums chart.|$|E

60|$|No year of Etheldred May's {{life had}} been so trying as this last. It seemed like her first {{step away from the}} {{aspirations}} of youth, into the graver fears of womanhood. With all the self-restraint that she had striven to exercise at Coombe, it had been a time of glorious dreams over the two young spirits who seemed to be growing up by her side to be faithful workers, destined to carry out her highest visions; and the boyish devotion of the one, the fraternal reverence of the other, had made her very happy. And now? The first disappointment in Leonard had led--not indeed to less esteem for him, but to that pitying veneration that could only be yielded by a sharing in spirit of the like martyrdom; a continued thankfulness and admiration, but a continual wringing of the heart. And her own child and pupil, Aubrey, had turned aside from the highest path; and in the unavowed consciousness that he was failing in the course he had so often traced out with her, and that all her aid and ready participation in his present interests were but from her outward not her inward heart, he had never argued the point with her, never consulted her on his destination. He had talked only to his father of his alteration of purpose, and had at least paid her the compliment of <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her profess that she was gratified by the change. In minor matters, he depended on her as much as ever; but Harry was naturally his chief companion, and the prime of his full and perfect confidence had departed, partly in the step from boy to man, but more from the sense that he was not fulfilling the soldiership he had dreamt of with her, and that he had once led her to think his talents otherwise dedicated. She had few fears for his steadiness, but she had some for his health, and he was something taken away from her--a brightness had faded from his image.|$|E

60|$|In 1847, {{a certain}} Count Leopold Ferri died at Padua, leaving a library entirely {{composed}} of works written by women, in various languages, and this library amounted to nearly 32,000 volumes. We will not hazard any conjecture {{as to the}} proportion of these volumes which a severe judge, like the priest in Don Quixote, would deliver to the flames, but for our own part, most of these we should care to rescue would be the works of French women. With a few remarkable exceptions, our own feminine literature {{is made up of}} books which could have been better written by men—books which have the same relation to literature is general, as academic prize poems have to poetry: when not a feeble imitation, they are usually an absurd exaggeration of the masculine style, like the swaggering gait of a bad actress in male attire. Few English women have written so much like a woman as Richardson’s Lady G. Now we think it an immense mistake to maintain that there is no sex in literature. Science has no sex: the mere knowing and reasoning faculties, if they act correctly, must go through the same process, and arrive at the same result. But in art and literature, which imply the action of the entire being, in which every fibre of the nature is engaged, in which every peculiar modification of the individual makes itself felt, woman has something specific to contribute. Under every imaginable social condition, she will necessarily have a class of sensations and emotions—the maternal ones—which must remain unknown to man; and the fact of her comparative physical weakness, which, however it may have been exaggerated by a vicious civilization, can never be cancelled, introduces a distinctively feminine condition into the wondrous chemistry of the affections and sentiments, which inevitably gives rise to distinctive forms and combinations. A certain amount of psychological difference between man and woman necessarily arises out of the difference of sex, and instead of being destined to vanish before a complete development of woman’s intellectual and moral nature, will be a permanent source of variety and beauty as long as the tender light and dewy freshness of morning affect us differently from the strength and brilliancy of the midday sun. And those delightful women of France, who {{from the beginning of the}} seventeenth to the close of the eighteenth century, formed some of the brightest threads in the web of political and literary history, wrote under circumstances which left the feminine character of their minds uncramped by timidity, and unstrained by mistaken effort. They were <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a career for themselves; they thought little, in many cases not at all, of the public; they wrote letters to their lovers and friends, memoirs of their every-day lives, romances in which they gave portraits of their familiar acquaintances, and described the tragedy or comedy which was going on before their eyes. Always refined and graceful, often witty, sometimes judicious, they wrote what they saw, thought, and felt in their habitual language, without proposing any model to themselves, without any intention to prove that women could write as well as men, without affecting manly views or suppressing womanly ones. One may say, at least with regard to the women of the seventeenth century, that their writings were but a charming accident of their more charming lives, like the petals which the wind shakes from the rose in its bloom. And it is but a twin fact with this, that in France alone woman has had a vital influence on the development of literature; in France alone the mind of woman has passed like an electric current through the language, making crisp and definite what is elsewhere heavy and blurred; in France alone, if the writings of women were swept away, a serious gap would be made in the national history.|$|E
