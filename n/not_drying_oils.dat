40|$|Typical Japanese {{natural resin}} films, i. e., oriental lacquer films, cashew resin films, and <b>drying</b> <b>oil</b> {{polymers}} were characterized, and also an ancient coating was identified using two-stage pyrolysis-gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). Urushiol, laccol, and thitsiol components, {{which are the}} main constituents of the respective oriental lacquers, were detected by the pyrolysis at 400. Additionally, the pyrolysis products, which reflect {{the structure of the}} urushiol, laccol, and thitsiol polymers, were detected by pyrolysis at 500 after pyrolysis at 400. All the results have shown a significant progress occurring in the side chain-side chain CC coupling and aromatic nucleus-side chain CO coupling of urushiol, laccol, and thitsiol concurrently with the formation of the respective lacquer films. The cashew resin film was found to be terminated with saturated cardols and cardanols by the pyrolysis at 400. Furthermore, pyrolysis at 500 revealed that the autoxidative side chain-side chain CC coupling accelerated the cross-linking of trienyl- and dienylcardanols during the polymerization.

We demonstrate {{that in the case of}} nonlinear instrument response the ratios of palmitic to stearic (P/S), distinctive for each oil type and used for <b>drying</b> <b>oil</b> identification, depend on sample dilution so that different dilutions of the same sample can give different P/S ratios. This phenomenon can hinder <b>drying</b> <b>oil</b> identification and lead to erroneous interpretations. This is an important observation as nowadays very often the P/S ratio is calculated from the corresponding peak area ratios or by the use of one-point calibration method. In these approaches, the linearity of the instrument response is not controlled and ensured. In the case analyzed, the nonlinear instrument response was attributed to incomplete sample evaporation in the injector. Packing of the glass liner with deactivated glass wool improved the sample evaporation and ensured the linearity of the instrument response and independence of the P/S ratio from sample dilution. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
