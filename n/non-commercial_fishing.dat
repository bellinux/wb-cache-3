Long term monitoring of an ecosystem’s fish community, along with abiotic and biotic factors that influence the fish community, is crucial in establishing effective management strategies. Currently, numerous monitoring programs exist across the United States. However, a long term monitoring program of non-game and <b>non-commercial</b> <b>fish</b> community dynamics has not been established within Kentucky Lake in Western Kentucky.

40|$|This paper {{serves to}} fill a gap in the {{existing}} literature by mapping the current seafood supply flows from various sources (local, U. S. domestic, and foreign) in Hawai‘i. Not since the earlier works of Hudgins (1980) and SMS Research (1983), have we seen any attempts to update estimates on the apparent consumption of seafood in Hawai‘i. We estimated the apparent consumption of seafood in Hawai‘i from all commercial sources at an annual average of 29 edible pounds per capita in the 10 -year period from 2000 to 2009. When non-commercial catch is included, the apparent consumption of seafood in Hawai‘i increases to an estimated annual average of 37 edible pounds per capita for the same time period. These results suggest <b>non-commercial</b> <b>fishing</b> is an important source of seafood supply in Hawai‘i. Overall, fresh tuna is the single largest consumed species, followed by salmon.

40|$|In stocks {{experiencing}} intensive fisheries, {{the quantitative}} assessment of food con-sumption is important in understanding the trophic interrelationships. As an example {{it has been reported}} that exploitation of the planktophage capelin stock in the Barents Sea resulted in the loss of the stable food base of the Arcto-Norwegian cod. The period of the sharpest decline in capelin abundance (1987 - 88) was followed by transition of food consumption of cod to the young of commercial fish and other small <b>non-commercial</b> <b>fish</b> and crustaceans. Consequently, changes were noted in some biological conditions of cod (Orlova et al., 1990 a). Food consumption investigations formed the basis for the construction of multi-type models in this study. The Arcto-Norwegian cod distribution is close to that of the Newfound-land cod, and hence similarities in rate of growth and sexual maturing, and also hydrological conditions and food composition, with the exception of sand eel (Ammodytes sp.), are known (Popova, 1962; Turuk, 1973, 1976; Lilly, 1987).

40|$|To {{find ways}} of {{reducing}} the by-catch in the North Sea brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) fishery, experiments were carried out with electric pulses. The basic idea was to selectively invoke a startle response in shrimp without stimulating any by-catch species. A selective groundrope could then be used in combination with electric pulses to obtain catch separation. Sea trials with the electro-net showed that the raised groundrope created an escape route for most fish species regularly caught in shrimp trawls, while the electric field made the shrimps tail-flip high enough to be caught. The electro-net with raised groundrope and small meshes in the top panel gave satisfactory results. The losses of commercial shrimp catches were negligible. Part of the undersized commercial fish catch could escape and <b>non-commercial</b> <b>fish</b> and invertebrates were caught in lower numbers compared to the standard gear.

40|$|Since its {{introduction}} to the Barents Sea from the North Pacific in the 1960 s, the red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) has become invasive.

A literature review was conducted, identifying factors contributing {{to the success of the}} crab as well as its interactions with native biota. Characteristics of the Barents Sea and the crab itself that may explain its success include suitable habitat for settlement and growth of the larvae; the wide range of habitats occupied throughout its life history, high mobility, generalist prey choice, low fishing pressure during establishment, and the lack of parasites. Being a large, bottom-feeding omnivore of great mobility, the king crab can significantly impact the ecosystem. Reduced benthic diversity and biomass have been registered in invaded areas.

40|$|The fishery for brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) in the North Sea {{is carried}} out by more than 600 vessels, with total annual brown shrimp {{landings}} of around 20, 000 t. Due to the small mesh size used, the catches also contain large amounts of unwanted by-catch. To find ways of reducing this by-catch, experiments were carried out during a one-year period with a sieve net rigged in a brown shrimp beam trawl. It was tested for its selective properties and an evaluation was made of its operational characteristics. The loss of commercial shrimp catch when using a sieve net was 15 % or less in favourable conditions. Certain components of the catch can. however, lead to a distortion of the outlet with a reduction of the commercial catch of over 30 %. It is likely that technical alterations to the outlet can prevent this. The sieve net showed very poor selective properties for commercial fish species with a length below 10 cm. Above 10 cm the selection improved with increasing length. Especially for Age 1 and older fish, this selective device serves its purpose.

40|$|Despite {{the common}} fleet {{segmentation}} in the DCR, {{it is still}} quite difficult to compare economic figures among countries. The reason behind this is that some member states are using thresholds based on the activity level of the fleet and some are not. From 2004 onwards, each EU member state is obliged to collect economic information on their fishing fleet, which is defined as all vessels registered in the EU fishing fleet register. This implies that Member States also have to submit data about {{a large number of}} vessels that show little or no fishing activity. This paper questions whether the goal of the DCR is served by including these commercially inactive vessels. This paper investigates the economic importance of the commercially inactive fishing fleet in The Netherlands and shows that for this large group of vessels (55 % of the registered fleet) the economic importance is negligible. In addition to this investigation, this paper shows that it is relatively easy to estimate the main economic indicators from readily available data sources. This data should be enough to have a general idea on the economic potential of the <b>non-commercial</b> <b>fishing</b> fleet. Based on these conclusions, it is proposed that a distinction be drawn between commercially active and inactive vessels based on a minimum income from fishing, as is already done in the agricultural data collection system. Collection of economic data by Member States should primarily focus on commercially active fleet segments; data about the commercially inactive fleet can be estimated.

40|$|Spatial {{priorities}} {{for the conservation of}} three key Mediterranean habitats, i. e. seagrass Posidonia oceanica meadows, coralligenous formations, and marine caves, were determined through a systematic planning approach. Available information on the distribution of these habitats across the entire Mediterranean Sea was compiled to produce basin-scale distribution maps. Conservation targets for each habitat type were set according to European Union guidelines. Surrogates were used to estimate the spatial variation of opportunity cost for commercial, <b>non-commercial</b> <b>fishing,</b> and aquaculture. Marxan conservation planning software was used to evaluate the comparative utility of two planning scenarios: (a) a wholebasin scenario, referring to selection of priority areas across the whole Mediterranean Sea, and (b) an ecoregional scenario, in which priority areas were selected within eight predefined ecoregions. Although both scenarios required approximately the same total area to be protected in order to achieve conservation targets, the opportunity cost differed between them. The whole-basin scenario yielded a lower opportunity cost, but the Alboran Sea ecoregion was not represented and priority areas were predominantly located in the Ionian, Aegean, and Adriatic Seas. In comparison, the ecoregional scenario resulted in a higher representation of ecoregions and a more even distribution of priority areas, albeit with a higher opportunity cost. We suggest that planning at the ecoregional level ensures better representativeness of the selected conservation features and adequate protection of species, functional, and genetic diversity across the basin. While there are several initiatives that identify priority areas in the Mediterranean Sea, our approach is novel as it combines three issues: (a) {{it is based on the}} distribution of habitats and not species, which was rarely the case in previous efforts, (b) it considers spatial variability of cost throughout this socioeconomically heterogeneous basin, and (c) it adopts ecoregions as the most appropriate level for large-scale planning.

40|$|Abundances of warm-water {{fish species}} (e. g. red mullet, john dory, triggerfish) have {{increased}} in UK waters during recent decades, while many coldwater species have experienced declines. There has been a massive influx of snake pipefish to UK waters since 2004, but unusual fish occurrences or sudden proliferations of species cannot definitively be attributed to climate change. A number of commercial and <b>non-commercial</b> <b>fish</b> species are suggested to have exhibited shifts in mean latitude over the past 25 years. Poor ‘recruitment’ in traditional fishery target species such as cod, plaice and herring {{may be related to}} a shift in the composition of zooplankton, which are a key prey for developing larvae. In some parts of the southern North Sea, cold-water species, such as cod and eelpout, have been shown to experience metabolic stress during warm years, as evidenced by slower growth rates and difficulties in supplying oxygen to body tissues. Climate change will have far-reaching impacts on the dynamics of fish populations, however knowledge of underlying mechanisms is rather limited, especially in <b>non-commercial</b> species. Excessive <b>fishing</b> pressure has caused fish populations to become more vulnerable to short-term natural climate variability by removing the oldest individuals, and making such populations less able to ‘buffer’ against occasional poor year classes. In the short term, climate change will have little influence on fish stock recovery, which depends instead upon reducing fishing effort to allow existing year classes to survive to maturity. Climate-related shifts in species distribution, behavior and depth preference may affect the ‘catchability’ of certain stocks to fishing fleets. Long-term climate change may affect the overall productivity of fish stocks in a given area. Some species may be adversely affected leading to reductions in sustainable yield whilst others, for example seabass, red mullet and John Dory, may be positively affected leading to enhanced fishing opportunities...|$|R
40|$|The Brown Shrimp (Crangon crangon L.) {{fishery in}} the North Sea, {{the focus of}} this study, is carried out with small meshed nets in {{vulnerable}} areas like coastal zones and estuaries. The discarding practices associated with it have been regarded as a problem for many years. The discussion, however, was difficult since no sufficiently reliable discard data were available. The need for data on this issue and a solution for the discard problem was the starting point of the study. The main objectives were to quantify the biological and economic consequences of discarding in the Brown Shrimp fishery and to evaluate possible technical alterations to the shrimp beam trawl to reduce discarding in this fishery. To fill the gap in knowledge on discarding practices in the North Sea Brown Shrimp fishery, a cooperative discard sampling programme was set up. In this study, absolute numbers of discards were produced. These were carefully examined in relation to other factors that determine the composition of a fish stock by using a newly designed biological and economic model. A next step in the project was a detailed study of the selectivity of the shrimp trawl. This was done for the sake of having a good description of the selective properties of the shrimp beam trawl and as a preparation for the experiments with selectivity improving devices. Three such devices were selected for study: 1) a selective sorting grid, 2) a selective sieve net and 3) electric pulses as an alternative stimulation. Although the selective grids have some clear advantages, like catch reduction of Age 1 + <b>fish,</b> <b>non-commercial</b> <b>fish</b> and invertebrates and better cod-end selectivity, they were found to be too susceptible to malfunction. The sieve net on the other hand, seemed to be a more acceptable device to fishermen with better selective properties. The basic idea in the application of electric pulses was to invoke selectively a startle response for shrimp with electric ticklers and to allow non-reacting species to escape underneath a raised groundrope. From the sea trials, it can be concluded that the electro-net gave satisfactory results. The losses of commercial shrimp were small or even non-existent. Part of the catch of undersized commercial fish species could escape and especially <b>non-commercial</b> <b>fish</b> and invertebrates were caught in lower numbers compared to the standard net. New technical measures were established in 2002 and included, for Belgium, the enforcement of the use of sieve nets in the Brown Shrimp fishery. Without doubt, these measures will reduce the impact that shrimp fishing has on the fish stocks and on the ecosystem as a whole. Nevertheless, where fishing occurs, impact on the ecosystem is inevitable. The Sea Fisheries Department has the intention to continue to strive towards more environmental friendly fishing...|$|R
50|$|A {{major factor}} {{that contributed to}} the {{depletion}} of the cod stocks off the shores of Newfoundland was the introduction and proliferation of equipment and technology that increased the volume of landed fish. For centuries local fishermen used technology that limited the volume of their catch, the area they fished, and allowed them to target specific species and ages of fish. From the 1950s onwards, as was common in all industries at the time, new technology was introduced that allowed fishermen to trawl a larger area, fish to a deeper depth and for a longer time. By the 1960s, powerful trawlers from the Soviet Union and its satellite countries, Great Britain, Spain, Portugal, Japan, and Canada, equipped with radar, electronic navigation systems and sonar allowed crews to pursue fish with unparalleled success, and Canadian catches peaked in the late 1960s and early 1970s.These new technologies adversely affected the Northern Cod population in two important ways: by increasing the area and depth that was fished, the cod were being depleted {{to the point that the}} surviving fish were incapable of replenishing the stock lost each year; and secondly, the trawlers caught enormous amounts of <b>non-commercial</b> <b>fish,</b> which although economically unimportant, held huge ecological significance: incidental catch undermines the functioning of the ecosystem as a whole, depleting stocks of important predator and prey species.

Gene mapping using {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNPs) to identify functional genes, gene expression (analogue microarrays and real-time PCR), and digital sequencing technologies looking at RNA transcripts present new concepts and opportunities in support of effective and sustainable fisheries. Genomic tools have been rapidly growing in aquaculture research addressing aspects of fish health, toxicology, and early development. Genomic technologies linking effects in functional genes involved in growth, maturation and life history development have been tied to selection resulting from harvest practices. Incorporating new and ever-increasing knowledge of fish genomes is opening a different perspective on local adaptation that will prove invaluable in wild fish conservation and management. Conservation of fish stocks is rapidly incorporating research on critical adaptive responses directed at the effects of human disturbance and climate change through gene expression studies. Genomic studies of fish populations can be generally grouped into three broad categories: 1) evolutionary genomics and biodiversity; 2) adaptive physiological responses to a changing environment; and 3) adaptive behavioral genomics and life history diversity.

40|$|The present {{fishing effort}} {{regulation}} for bottom trawls in the North Sea (EU 40 / 2008) reduces the fishing effort with larger co-dend mesh sizes (> 100 mm mesh opening) to 86 fishing days per year. The {{aim of this}} technical measure is {{the protection of the}} weak cod stock usually harvested with this mesh opening. By combining the results of our selectivity investigations on plaice during a commercial fishing trip and the samples taken within the frame of the EU data collection regulation (DCR) we could draw conclusions on commercial and <b>non-commercial</b> <b>fish</b> species. When using codend meshes with larger mesh opening the discard was reduced remarkably. In the reference codend with 80 mm mesh opening the undersized bycatch was 47 % of the total catch of plaice, in the experimental codends with 120 mm mesh opening it was only 7 % and with 130 mm mesh opening just 3 %. On the other hand however, the applied mesh openings in the experimental codends let escape marketable plaice to some extent. The loss of catch was assessed on the basis of fish numbers per length class using a length-weight conversion rate from the DCR. The loss by weight of marketable fish with 120 mm codend mesh opening was 18 %, and 28 % with 130 mm codend mesh opening. To assure the protection of young round and flatfish with one general mesh size, a new regulation should prescribe a minimum mesh opening of 120 mm, accompanied by an expansion of the fishing effort...|$|R

A comprehensive literature review, a general survey on perceptions and attitudes, and workshops using policy relevant decision support frameworks were used to understand, educate and assist west coast fishery management participants in evaluating the strengths, weaknesses, and trade offs associated with the potential use of MBI compared to traditional CAC regulations in managing the adverse impacts of fishing on marine ecosystems. Survey results suggest that although there were some differences among the various stakeholder groups, fishery management participants are familiar, receptive and perceive MBI as an effective, potential way to manage the adverse environmental impacts of fishing on the west coast. Workshop results indicate that there was little difference among the diverse stakeholder groups in evaluating the different policy approaches towards managing the adverse environmental impacts of fishing on the west coast. An individual transferable bycatch quota of <b>non-commercial</b> <b>fish</b> species is a market-based policy option that had high criteria satisfaction, while managing the essential fish habitat through market based instruments was ranked low and had high uncertainties.

The interviews are taken according to present-day rules of good conduct in 'oral history' projects. The period is set at between 1930 and 1980.

The interviews ideally yield many biologically and ecologically relevant data. The themes and questions are chosen accordingly but leave room for the unexpected. The main bulk of information is expected to be related to commercial species.

In {{the present}} paper we study effect of {{information}} uncertainty on efficiency of multispecies fishery contracts, when private harvesting costs are uncertain. A static game between a principal and two fishing fleets is considered, when fishermen are completely selective about allocation of their harvesting efforts between the commercial and <b>non-commercial</b> <b>fish</b> species. It is assumed that the two fish stocks are antagonistic (i. e. high level of the non-commercial stock prevents growth of the commercial stock). Costs associated with harvesting non-commercial species is private information of each fisherman, and can be either high or low. In case of outgrowth of non-commercial species, the principal wishes to propose a contract to the fishermen to harvest non-commercial species as well as commercial, to recover the stock of the commercial species. Such contract regulates harvesting efforts for both species and specifies contract payments to the fishermen for harvesting non-commercial species. We show that such two-species regulation under the contract leads to recovery of the commercial stock in the long run. However, if harvesting costs are private information of the fishermen {{and there is no}} learning, implementation of the social optimum leads to potential loss of efficiency and requires implementation of second best solution (contract under adverse selection) ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2004 Multispecies {{demersal}} trawl {{surveys are}} used in the United States and internationally to estimate the relative abundance of commercial and <b>non-commercial</b> <b>fish</b> species. Their usefulness for estimating species' abundance is often limited by the variance associated with estimates. This study implemented and evaluated alternative sampling and estimation methods, with the goal to incorporate additional sources of information for increased precision of individual species' estimates from multispecies trawl surveys. First, habitat characteristics and past spatial distributions of four flatfish species' density were incorporated into a multispecies trawl survey design conducted in Kalsin and Middle Bays, Kodiak Island, Alaska. Stratification by depth and percent sand produced estimates of relative abundance with lower CV s than those from unstratified sampling. Additional decreases in relative precision were generally not achieved by estimating the relative abundance of multiple species from regions of species-specific suboptimal habitat. Second, a poststratification technique was used to incorporate species-specific habitat characteristics and previous distributions of species' density into the estimation of species' abundance from the Kalsin and Middle Bays' trawl survey. Poststratification by habitat gave estimates with lower variance and/or less design-bias than an unstratified estimator for all species in all years. Poststratification by habitat and fish density produced estimates with the least design-bias for all species in all years and the lowest variance when stratum sample sizes were sufficient. Third, mixed model linear regression (MMLR), empirical Bayes (EB) and hierarchical Bayes (HB) estimation methods were used to incorporate historical trends of yellowfin sole, Limanda aspera biomass from the eastern Bering Sea trawl survey into annual biomass estimates. Using MMLR, EB, and HB methods resulted in biomass estimates that were less anomalous than survey estimates with respect to a linear regression trend. Estimates for all three methods had lower CV s than surveys in most years. The results of this thesis suggest that incorporating additional information into survey design and estimation can decrease the variability of survey estimates and/or correct for possible bias.

This makes modelling of advective ocean transports a powerful tool in various fields of science where a displacement of something over time is studied. The present thesis comprises four different applications of ocean-transport modelling, ranging from large-scale heat transports to the dispersion of juvenile marine organisms. The aim has been to adapt the method {{not only to the}} object of study, but also to the available model-data sets and in situ-observations. The first application in the thesis is a study of the oceanic heat transport. It illustrates the importance of wind forcing for not only the heat transport from the Indian to the Atlantic Ocean, but also for the net northward transport of heat in the Atlantic. In the next study focus is on the particle-transport differences between an open and a semi-enclosed coastal area on the Swedish coast of the Baltic Sea. The modelled patterns of sedimentation and residence times in the two basins are examined after particles having been released from a number of prescribed point sources. In the two final studies the transport-modelling framework is applied within a marine-ecology context and the transported entities are larvae of some Scandinavian sessile and sedentary species and <b>non-commercial</b> <b>fishes</b> (e. g. the bay barnacle, the blue mussel, the shore crab and the gobies). The effects of depth distribution of dispersing larvae on the efficiency of the Marine Protected Areas in the Baltic Sea are examined. Further, the diversity in dispersal and connectivity depending on vertical behaviour is modelled for regions with different tidal regimes in the North Sea, the Skagerrak and the Kattegat. The spatial scales dealt with in the studies varied from global to a highly resolved 182 -metres grid. The model results, excepting those from the global study, are based on or compared with in situ-data. At the time of the doctoral defense, the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 2 : Submitted. Paper 3 : Submitted. 4 : Manuscript. </p...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{changes have}} been {{observed}} in South African marine ecosystems. The main pressures on these ecosystems are fishing, climate change, pollution, ocean acidification and mining. The best long-term datasets are for trends in fishing pressures {{but there are many}} gaps, especially for <b>non-commercial</b> species. <b>Fishing</b> pressures have varied over time, depending on the species being caught. Little information exists for trends in other anthropogenic pressures. Field observations of environmental variables are limited in time and space. Remotely sensed satellite data have improved spatial and temporal coverage but the time-series are still too short to distinguish long-term trends from interannual and decadal variability. There are indications of recent cooling on the West and South coasts and warming on the East Coast over a period of 20 - 30 years. Oxygen concentrations on the West Coast have decreased over this period. Observed changes in offshore marine communities include southward and eastward changes in species distributions, changes in abundance of species, and probable alterations in foodweb dynamics. Causes of observed changes are difficult to attribute. Full understanding of marine ecosystem change requires ongoing and effective data collection, management and archiving, and coordination in carrying out ecosystem research. DHE...|$|R
40|$|Research PaperThe 1992 {{fisheries}} settlement {{between the}} New Zealand government and Maori {{is the largest}} Treaty settlement to date in New Zealand and is significant internationally for {{the extent of the}} transfer of rights to a resource from the state to an indigenous people. In this paper, the challenges presented by the ongoing implementation of the fisheries settlement are assessed on three fronts - the challenges for Maori, the government, and other fisheries stakeholders respectively - particularly in the context of moves to encourage greater stakeholder participation in fisheries management and the promotion of stakeholder driven ‘Fisheries Plans’ as a tool for achieving greater participation. The decade since 1992 has seen a slow but steady implementation of the fisheries settlement on two main fronts - the negotiation and implementation of <b>non-commercial</b> customary <b>fishing</b> regulations, and the less steady path towards the allocation of commercial fisheries assets to iwi (tribes). While progress in both these areas to date has been relatively self-contained, the implications of each for wider fisheries management are large. The integration of Maori customary and commercial fishing rights into the overall fisheries property rights framework will impact on all fisheries stakeholders in the immediate future...|$|R
40|$|One of the sectors gravely {{hampered}} by water hyacinth (WH) on L. Victoria (Kenya) is the fishery sector. This has prompted {{the need to}} develop an approach for modeling impacts of WH on fish production. The main objective of this study was assessing the impact of (WH) on production and fish species composition on the L. Victoria fishery (Kenya). It was postulated that WH infestation has led to reduced fish catch, net benefits and change in fish species composition. Cost benefit analysis (CBA) provided information on the net benefits of fishing with and without WH, while Production functions (PF) were used to establish determinants of fish production using cross sectional data. Error Correction Models (ECM) used beach sample times series data (1990 - 2000) to assess the effect of WH, climate and fish prices on the major L. Victoria fisheries, while Vector Auto regression (VAR) models were used to measure the effects of fish price and WH intensity on fish species composition of L. Victoria (1986 - 2000). The results showed that WH intensity was highest between 1996 - 1999 and increased fishing costs by 35 % and decreased net income by 52 %. The PFs identified fishing crew, boat size and WH as having significant effects on fish catch and income. Both the PF and ECM results indicated that WH had a negative and positive effect on the Tilapiines and mixed fish respectively. In the short run ECM results indicated that both rainfall and price had less significant effect on catch per unit effort (CPUE) in all fisheries. However, in the long run price had significant impacts in most of the fisheries as compared to the rainfall factor. Trends in the fish species composition indicated an increase in the mixed Tilapiines and Protopterus while there was a decline in the R. argentea and Mormyrus. The impulse response analysis indicated that a 10 % shock in WH led to a decline of fish catch for R. argentea (1. 5 %) and an increase in Protopterus (8 %), Mixed Tilapiines (10 %) and Haplochromis (2 %). Generally, the prices moved in the same direction with the catch and then changed to opposite direction as from the third year. Since the benefits of WH are realized on the <b>non-commercial</b> <b>fish</b> species but little or negative on the three major commercial species, there is need to develop a suitable surveillance and control system for WH in order to keep this weed below economic injury levels The CBA, PF, ECM and VAR models were recommended for impact assessments of WH on fish productivity, net benefits and fish species composition. The choice of each will depend on the objectives of the study and data availability...|$|R
40|$|While {{the health}} {{benefits}} of eating fish are well established, Australian seafood consumption remains below the average for industrialised nations. While considerable research has been conducted into fish consumption in European countries, little research has been conducted on how and why Australians consume fish. This research sought to address that gap by investigating Australian consumers’ consumption of, and attitudes toward, Finfish. The research objectives sought to determine current fish consumption, future consumption intentions, drivers for and barriers to fish consumption, and the impact of convenience orientation, health involvement, food involvement, food-related lifestyle, and personal characteristics on fish consumption. An online survey of 899 people was administered in June 2010 via an online consumer panel. Respondents were screened for fish consumption and selected for regular, light, and very light fishconsumption. The research revealed that fish consumption is influenced by evaluative and affective attitudes including perceptions of the sensory qualities of fish and hedonic attributes, extrinsic cues (branding, packaging, labelling, display, point of sale information, pricing), preferences, perceived benefits (taste, convenience, health, diet variety and versatility) and perceived barriers (price, availability, concerns about fish safety and lack of knowledge and confidence in selecting, storing, serving and preparing fish). Other factors found to influence fish consumption included social norms or acceptability, moral obligations (to the household, sustainable and humane production, and local industry), and commercial and <b>non-commercial</b> influences. <b>Fish</b> consumption was also found to be impacted by past experience, habits, childhood fish consumption, convenience orientation, foodrelated lifestyle, consumption occasion and personal characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Climate change, {{specifically}} temperature, {{affects the}} distribution and densities of species in marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Here, {{we looked at the}} effect of temperature during winter and spawning period on latitudinal range shifts and changes in abundance of two <b>non-commercial</b> North Sea <b>fish</b> species, solenette (Buglossidium luteum) and scaldfish (Arnoglossus laterna). Both species have increased in abundance and moved to the north since the late 1980 s, coinciding with a series of mild winters. In 1996, following a very cold winter, the abundance of both species temporarily decreased as they retracted to the south. The shift in temperature affected adult habitat conditions, allowing them to immigrate into new areas where they subsequently reproduced successfully. We can conclude this because recruitment improved following the increase in abundance. The recruitment relates significantly to the higher adult stock and higher temperatures. The predictions of higher average temperatures and milder winters in the North Sea make it likely that these species will increase further in abundance and move northward. The observed increase in abundance of these small flatfish species will affect the North Sea food web and therefore commercial species, e. g. plaice, by predation on juveniles and competition for benthic food resource...|$|R
40|$|EPA's {{proposed}} {{rule for}} mercury reductions from coal-fired utility boilers {{is unlikely to}} provide significant health benefits, both because mercury exposure at current levels {{is unlikely to be}} causing harm, and because even in a best case scenario the mercury rule could reduce mercury in fish by {{no more than a few}} percent. The claim that reducing mercury in fish will reduce neurological harm to fetuses of exposed pregnant women is based on the assumptions that the results of an epidemiologic study of mothers and children in the Faroe Islands represents a genuine cause-effect relationship between low-level mercury exposure and children's neurological health, and that Faroes-like effects would occur in Americans even at mercury exposures as low as 1 / 15 th the minimum level associated with health effects in the Faroes study. But even accepting these assumptions at face value, the reported health effects are subtle and at current American mercury exposure levels have no implications for general neurological or cognitive health. For example, based on the Faroes results, a complete elimination of U. S. utility mercury emissions could, in a best-case scenario, move children who are at, say, the 10 th percentile on neurological and cognitive test scores to between the 10. 3 and 10. 6 percentiles. Even this small improvement is unrealistically optimistic, because it also assumes a one-to-one correspondence between mercury emission reductions and mercury levels in freshwater fish, and that people with high mercury exposures receive all of their mercury from <b>non-commercial,</b> freshwater <b>fish.</b> Furthermore, a similar study of children in the Seychelles reported no harm from mercury exposures several times higher than even relatively highly exposed Americans. The Seychelles study may be more relevant to Americans, because people in the Seychelles are exposed to mercury through eating ocean fish, while people in the Faroe Islands are exposed through eating whale blubber. EPA's mercury rule is thus likely to provide few or no health benefits. On the other hand, EPA estimates even modest utility mercury reductions will cost about $ 1. 4 billion per year. These costs will in part be passed through to consumers, reducing the resources available for other health- and welfare-enhancing expenditures. If EPA still wishes to go forward with utility regulations, rather than regulate mercury directly, EPA should scrap both its mercury rule and its companion Interstate Air Quality Rule, which would regulate utility nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and instead require reductions only in SO 2 emissions. SO 2 reductions will reduce mercury levels in fish by reducing sulfate levels in lakes and streams, which reduces methylmercury formation, the form of mercury that gets into fish and to which people are exposed. Furthermore, the SO 2 reductions will reduce mercury in freshwater fish regardless of where the mercury in fish is coming from and will cost less than mercury reductions. SO 2 reductions will also reduce sulfate particulate matter and regional haze, and the measures necessary to reduce SO 2 emissions will also modestly reduce mercury emissions. While the costs of additional SO 2 reductions might still outweigh their benefits, the cost-benefit picture for utility SO 2 reductions is far superior to even the most generous best-case benefit estimates for EPA's proposed utility mercury rule. ...|$|R
