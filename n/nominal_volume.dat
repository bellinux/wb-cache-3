Also, as an arising concern in networking research area, the protocol-independent traffic redundancy elimination (RE) technique helps to reduce (a. k. a compress) traffic load on backbone network. Motivation from a formulation perspective, we first present an extended model of the classical multi-commodity flow problem with compressible flows. Moreover, our model is robust with fluctuation of traffic demand and compression rate. In details, we allow any set of a predefined size of traffic flows to deviate simultaneously from their <b>nominal</b> <b>volumes</b> or compression rates. As an applicable example, we use this model to combine redundancy elimination and energy-aware routing to increase energy efficiency for a backbone network.

We formally define the problem and model it as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). We then propose an efficient heuristic algorithm that is suitable for large networks.

They can directly reflect {{the amount of}} incoming solar radiation into space; by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), they can indirectly impact climate by affecting cloud albedo. Our current assessment of the interactions of aerosols and clouds is uncertain and parameters used to estimate cloud droplet formation in global climate models are not well constrained. Organic aerosols attribute much of the uncertainty in these estimates and are known to affect the ability of aerosol to form cloud droplets (CCN Activity) by i) providing solute, thus reducing the equilibrium water vapor pressure of the droplet and ii) acting as surfactants capable of depressing surface tension, and potentially, growth kinetics. My thesis dissertation investigates various organic aerosol species (e. g., marine, urban, biomass burning, Humic-like Substances). An {{emphasis is placed on}} the water soluble components and secondary organic aerosols (SOA). In addition the sampled organic aerosols are acquired via different media; directly from in-situ ambient studies (TEXAQS 2006) environmental chamber experiments, regenerated from filters, and cloud water samples.

40|$|In a {{laboratory}} flume, a comparative {{study on the}} near-bottom performance of the Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) was conducted. Two different ADV systems were tested for different configurations and two flow velocities (9 cm s− 1, 18 cm s− 1). The results were compared with synchronous measurements with a Laser Doppler Anemometer (LDA). Near-bottom velocity measurements with the ADV have to be interpreted carefully as the ADV technique underestimates flow velocities in a zone close to the sediment. The height of this zone above the sediment varies with different ADV systems and configurations. The values for <b>nominal</b> sampling <b>volume</b> height (SVH) given by the software often underestimate the true, effective sampling <b>volume</b> heights. Smaller <b>nominal</b> SVH improve the ADV near-bottom performance, but the vertical extent of the zone in which the ADV underestimates flow by more than 20 % may be larger than true SVH/ 2 {{by a factor of}} 2 (=true SVH). When the measurement volume approaches the bottom, ADV data quality parameters (signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and signal amplitude) exceeding the average ‘open water’ level, are clear indicators that the ADV has begun to underestimate the flow velocity. Unfortunately, this is not a safe indicator for the range of reliable measurements as the ADV may begin to underestimate velocities even with unchanged ‘open water’ data quality parameters. Thus, one can only recommend avoiding measurements below a distance from the bottom that was defined empirically comparing the ADV and the LDA velocity profiles. This distance is 2. 5 times <b>nominal</b> sampling <b>volume</b> height for the tested ADV systems and experimental settings...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of the AiF {{research}} project No 11503 N 1 "Test and Improvement of the Measuring Accuracy of Multichannel Piston Pipettes", the time for testing a multichannel pipette was reduced from 11 - 12 hours (using the nominal gravimetric test method) or 6 hours (using a modified gravimetric method) to 1. 5 hours by developing a semiautomatic gravimetric unit with weighing cells operating with strain gauges (testing unit 1). This was achieved by simultaneously pipetting with up to 12 channels and then simultaneously weighing the dispensed fluid volume. For this purpose, a testing unit was constructed in which the distance between the weighing scales is equal to the distance between the channels of a multichannel pipette (= 9 mm). By the use of weighing cells with strain gauges, a weighing accuracy was obtained that corresponds to an analytical balance of 0. 1 mg resolution. Thus, this unit can test multichannel pipettes with a <b>nominal</b> <b>volume</b> from 50 to 300 µ. It was not possible to further increase resolution and accuracy by using strain gauges. Based on previous experience, a second, significantly optimised unit (testing unit 2) was developed. The most important new aspect was the introduction of weighing cells with electromagnetic force compensation, as they are used in semi-microbalances. Using this new testing unit, pipettes with a <b>nominal</b> <b>volume</b> of up to 10 µ can be tested in significantly reduced time. For the very first time, a complete, standardised gravimetric test of a multichannel pipette was performed in less than 15 minutes.

The larger volume hopper is designed to handle variability in the output of the READCO mixer and process upsets without entering set back during processing. The objectives of this task involve scaling the proposed hopper design and testing the scaled hopper for the following processing issues: (1) The effect of agitation on radar measurement. Formation of a vortex may affect the ability to accurately measure the tank level. The agitator was run at varying speeds and with varying grout viscosities to determine what parameters cause vortex formation and whether measurement accuracy is affected. (2) A dry feeds over addition.

A grout with a W/P of 0. 53 represents the upper bound of grout rheology that could be processed at the facility.
