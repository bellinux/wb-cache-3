5|$|The most {{significant}} {{change to the}} district is the extension on the southeast, to the boundary of the city's Eighth Ward in 1870. Between Adams and Ferry streets, three blocks would be added, with the new boundary following {{the west side of}} St. Mary's Avenue, excluding a newer house at the <b>northwest</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the Washington Avenue intersection, and then rear property lines to Kennedy Lane and Hill Street just south of Adams. Two-story rowhouses predominate in this area, many built as worker housing during the 19th century, some as early as the Federal period. Some have intact storefronts. It also has the only significant industrial building in the proposed expanded district, the former Lusco Paper Works on the <b>northwest</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> Fifth and Liberty streets. The area has begun to see some restoration efforts, such as some Greek Revival rowhouses on Liberty Street near Fourth, which will benefit from state tax credits should the area be added to the district.|$|E

The Toronto General Burying Grounds Trust was formed by {{the owners of the}} Potter's Field cemetery, which lay at the <b>northwest</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> Yonge and Bloor. As the cemetery blocked the growth of Yorkville, the village pressured the province to move the interred to a new burial ground; the trust purchased The Necropolis.|$|E

5|$|East of {{the main}} {{gatehouse}} was a two-storey building with a basement. The basement was probably used for storage while the above two floors provided accommodation. The purpose of the buildings along {{the west end of}} the north range is uncertain. The sparse arrangement, with little provision for lighting, has led to suggestions that it was used as stables, however there are no drains which are usually associated with stables. The tower in the <b>northwest</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the castle had a garderobe and fireplace on each of the three above-ground floors, and there was a basement underneath.|$|E
5|$|For 32 {{years there}} was no {{permanent}} memorial to the victims.

The memorial, a -high concave wall with interlocking bricks displaying {{the names of the}} crash victims, was formally dedicated in a ceremony on October 15, 2011. The memorial is located at Lake Park at the <b>northwest</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> Lee and Touhy Avenues, two miles east of the crash site.|$|E

The areas having problems right now include the northeast and <b>northwest</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> Iowa and west central Iowa. Some of these heavily-infested fields were sprayed with an insecticide earlier this year. From my observations this week, I noticed aggregated colonies at the end rows...|$|R

5|$|In the <b>northwest</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the Khilawat Khana {{stands the}} Kala Burj ("Black Pavilion"). The {{pavilion}} {{is the most}} significant of the Jahangir-era additions to the Lahore Fort. The vaulted ceilings in the pavilion feature paintings in a European-influenced style of angels which symbolize the virtuosity of King Solomon, who is regarded as the ideal ruler in the Quran, and a ruler with whom Jahangir identified. Angels directing djinns are also painted on tiles in the ceiling, which also reference King Solomon. Kala Burj was used as a summer pavilion.|$|E

I-96/I-275 passes through an interchange with 8Mile Road while crossing into Oakland County entering {{the southwest corner of}} Farmington Hills. North of 10Mile Road, I-96/I-275 crosses Grand River Avenue. Here the ramps start to connect with both directions of M-5, the start of eastbound I-696 or the continuation of westbound I-96. MDOT ends the I-275 designation at this massive interchange.|$|E
