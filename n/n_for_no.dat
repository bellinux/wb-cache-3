5000|$|For printing, the 407 used type wheels, an {{improvement}} over earlier tabulators that used print bars. The 48-character wheels were stationary until a character impulse was to be printed; the wheel then rotated in two steps. the first step rotated each wheel to one of 12 groups of characters based on the digit impulse associated with that print position. Digit impulses included the digits 1 through 9 (in reverse order), the 8-3 and 8-4 combination punches and a group (<b>N)</b> <b>for</b> <b>no</b> digit impulse. One of four characters in each group was then selected based on the zone impulse (0, 11, 12 or none) for that character position. This selection happened {{at the same time}} the type wheel was driven against the ribbon. The timing of the zone impulse selection was controlled by a complex set of linkages and electromagnets called the Analyzer, one for each of the 120 print positions. Each type wheel also emitted an impulse (called [...] "echo") for the character actually printed. The control panel could be wired so the echo impulses were accumulated for totals; report totals then reliably reflected what had actually been printed.|$|E
5000|$|Louisiana {{is one of}} {{the easiest}} states to get on the ballot. Anyone may obtain a spot on the ballot by either paying a {{qualifying}} fee, or submitting petition signatures. For independent candidates for President (or non-recognized parties) the fee is $500 or 5000 signatures, with at least 500 from each Congressional district. Recognized Parties simply file their slate of Electors - their access is automatic, no fee or signatures required. For statewide office, the signature requirement is the same as that for President, but the fees are $750 for Governor and $600 for all other statewide offices. District and local office fees range from $40 or 50 signatures for a small town office, to $600 or 1000 signatures for US House. All signatures for district offices must come from within that district. If the office is for a political party committee, the signatures must be from people affiliated with that party. For Presidential Preference Primaries, the fee is $750 or 1000 signatures affiliated with that party from each Congressional district.(pdf) Present Louisiana law only allows for Presidential Primaries if a party has more than 40,000 registered voters statewide. Currently, this only applies to the Democratic and Republican Parties. Louisiana law changed in 2004 under efforts from the Libertarian Party of Louisiana to relax rules in place at that time for recognizing political parties in the state. There are now two methods to gain official recognition. Method A allows a party to be recognized if it pays a $1000 fee AND has 1000 or more voters registered under its label. To retain recognition, it must field a candidate at least once in any four-year period in a statewide election - with no requirement on performance in the election. Statewide election slots include Presidential Elector, Governor, Senator, Lt. Governor, Secretary of State, Attorney General, Treasurer, Comm. of Insurance, and Commissioner of Agriculture. To date, the Libertarian Party and the Green Party have used this method to attain and retain official party recognition. Method B allows a party to be recognized if one of its candidates in a statewide race or for Presidential Elector achieves 5% of the vote. To retain recognition, it must repeat the 5% tally for statewide office or Presidential Elector at least once in any four-year period. To date, the Reform Party has used this method to gain and retain official party recognition. Due to their size, parties recognized by these methods are exempt from certain laws governing public elections of political committee offices and from certain financial reporting requirements until their membership reaches 5% of registered voters statewide. Recognized political parties in Louisiana are allowed to have their party name appear alongside their candidates on the ballot, and for their party to be offered as a specific choice on voter registration cards. Non-recognized parties appear as OTHER, and the party name must be written in on the registration card. Non-affiliated voters are listed as <b>N</b> <b>for</b> <b>No</b> Party. In the 2008 and 2010 Congressional elections, Louisiana experimented with closed primaries for House and Senate. Under this system, recognized parties participated in semi-closed primaries before the general election. Only one candidate from each party was allowed on the General Election ballot; there was no limit for OTHER or NONE. An attempt to pass a law differentiating [...] "minor" [...] parties similar to the rule for Presidential Primaries was defeated but made irrelevant by Louisiana reverting to its [...] "Jungle Primary" [...] system where all candidates, regardless of number from any party, all compete together on the same ballot. If no one achieves a majority, a general election is held as a run-off between the top two, also regardless of party affiliation.|$|E

40|$|Mobilization {{of natural}} nitrate (NO 3 -) {{deposits}} in the subsoil by irrigation water in arid and semiarid regions {{has the potential}} to produce large groundwater NO 3 - concentrations. The use of isotopes to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic NO 3 - sources in these settings could be complicated by the wide range in δ 15 N values of natural NO 3 -. An 10 000 year record of paleore-charge from the regionally extensive High Plains aquifer indicates that δ 15 <b>N</b> values <b>for</b> <b>NO</b> 3 - derived from natural sources ranged from 1. 3 to 12. 3 ‰ and increased systematically from the northern to the southern High Plains.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{elucidate}} the early detachment of the Solitaire stent during mechanical thrombectomy, {{we tested the}} stent in vitro under various conditions and evaluated with microscopy. METHODS: A total of five stents were tested. Using a dynamic mechanical analysis machine, we calculated the tensile force needed for separation of the four stents from the pusher wire. Stent Nos 1 and 2 were tested without any prior manipulation. During the retraction test, no sheathing around the stent-wire junction was applied to stent No 1 whereas stent No 2 was partially covered with a sheath in accordance with instructions for use (IFU) recommendations. Stent No 3 was tested after deployment and retrieval were performed three times in an in vitro vascular replica with sheathing during retrieval. Stent No 4 was tested after one deployment and retrieval using the same replica as in stent No 3 without sheathing. In addition, forward pushing force was applied intentionally during retraction to induce excessive bending of the stent. Stent No 5 was pulled apart by both hands. After separation, stent tips and pusher wires were studied for all stents under the microscope. RESULTS: The tensile force needed for separation was about 6 <b>N</b> <b>for</b> stent <b>Nos</b> 1, 2, and 3, and about 4 <b>N</b> <b>for</b> stent <b>No</b> 4.

The mechanical characteristics of FRC posts can influence the clinical prognostic. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the flexural strength and fracture resistance of commercially available FRC posts Material and methods: Fourteen human single-rooted premolars with completely formed apices were selected and received endodontic treatment. The specimens were divided into two groups related to the post system: i) Group A – cylindrical-conical fiber-reinforced post (White post DC, FGM), and ii) group B – conical fiber-reinforced post (EXACTO, Angelus). The fracture resistance was evaluated and two point bending tests were carried out. The glass fiber characteristics and the tag penetration of the luting material into the radicular dentin structure were evaluated through scanning electronic microscopy in an illustrative way. One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD test (α = 0. 05) were applied.

Method and Materials: One electrophoretic deposition alumina ceramic (Wolceram, Wolceram) and 4 zirconia-based systems (ce. novation, ce. novation; Cercon, DeguDent; Digizon, Amann Girrbach; and Lava, 3 M ESPE) were investigated. A porcelain-fused-to-metal method (Academy, Bego Medical) {{was used in}} either conventional casting technique or laser sintering. Sixteen crowns of each material were fabricated and veneered with glass-ceramic as recommended by the manufacturers. Crown and root dimensions were measured, and 8 crowns of each system were adhesively bonded or conventionally cemented. After the crowns were artificially aged in a simulated oral environment (1, 200, 000 mechanical loads with 50 N; 3, 000 thermal cycles with distilled water between 5 °C and 55 °C; 2 minutes per cycle), fracture resistance and fracture patterns were determined and defect sizes investigated. Results: The fracture force varied between 1, 111 N and 2, 038 <b>N</b> <b>for</b> conventional cementation and between 1, 181 N and 2, 295 <b>N</b> <b>for</b> adhesive bonding. <b>No</b> {{significant differences were found}} between adhesive and conventional cementations. Fracture patterns presented mostly as a chipping of the veneering, in single cases as a fracture of the core, and in 1 case as a fracture of the tooth. Conclusions: Crown material and cementation do not have any significant influence on the fracture force and fracture performance of all-ceramic and metal-based crowns. Therefore, it may be concluded that adhesive bonding is not necessary for the application of high-strength ceramics...|$|R

40|$|A new genus of Agathidinae (Hymenoptera, Braconidae), Neothlipsis, is {{proposed}} to include 10 species. Nine {{of these species}} were formerly included in the polyphyletic genus Therophilus Wesmael 1837, formerly referred to as Bassus. A new species, Neothlipsis parysae, parasitic on Samea multiplicalis (Guenée), is described. The ten described species transferred to Neothlipsis are:, Neothlipsis agathoides, comb. <b>n.</b> <b>for</b> Bassus agathoides Newton and Sharkey 2000; Neothlipsis agilis, comb. <b>n.</b> <b>for</b> Bassus agilis Cresson 1868; Neothlipsis brevicauda, comb. <b>n.</b> <b>for</b> Bassus brevicaudus Muesebeck 1932; Neothlipsis californica, comb. <b>n.</b> <b>for</b> Bassus californicus Muesebeck 1927; Neothlipsis cincta, comb. <b>n.</b> <b>for</b> Microdus cinctus Cresson 1873; Neothlipsis coleophorae, comb. <b>n.</b> <b>for</b> Bassus coleophorae Rowher 1915; Neothlipsis discolor, comb. <b>n.</b> <b>for</b> Microdus discolor Cresson 1873; Neothlipsis nigricoxa, comb. <b>n.</b> <b>for</b> Microdus nigricoxus Provancher 1886; Neothlipsis petiolate, comb. <b>n.</b> <b>for</b> Bassus petiolatus Muesebeck 1932; Neothlipsis taeniativentris, comb. <b>n.</b> <b>for</b> Microdus taeniativentris Enderlein 1920. Phylogenetic analyses support the sister relationship between the new genus and Camptothlipsis.

40|$|Electrospray-ionization tandem mass {{spectrometry}} {{was used to}} determine the binding energy of HSO 4 -(H 2 SO 4) <b>n</b> ions <b>for</b> <b>n</b> up to 4 and NO 3 -(HNO 3) <b>n</b> ions <b>for</b> <b>n</b> up to 3. The binding energies obtained experimentally are substantially lower than those in the literature except for the values <b>for</b> <b>NO</b> 3 -(HNO 3) and HSO 4 -(H 2 SO 4). The geometries of HSO 4 -(H 2 SO 4) n and NO 3 -(HNO 3) <b>n</b> <b>for</b> <b>n</b> up to 3 were optimized using the following levels of theory: AM 1, HF/ 3 - 21 G, HF/ 6 - 31 + G(d) B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 + G(d), and B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 + G(d,p). The values calculated at B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 + G(d,p) are in fair agreement with those in the literature. For the same order of clustering, sulfuric acid clusters are bound more strongly than the nitric acid analogues. Neutral acid molecules form clusters with core ions via hydrogen bonds. As the number of neutrals increases, the binding energy decreases...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a global three-dimensional model for tropospheric O 3 -NO x-hydrocarbon chemistry with synoptic-scale resolution. A suite of 15 chemical tracers, including O 3, NO x, PAN, HNO 3, CO, H 2 O 2, and various hydrocarbons, is simulated in the model. For computational expediency, chemical production {{and loss of}} tracers are parameterized as polynomial functions to fit {{the results of a}} detailed O 3 -NO x-hydrocarbon mechanism. The model includes state-of-the-art inventories of anthropogenic emissions and process-based formulations of natural emissions and deposition that are tied to the model meteorology. Improvements are made to existing schemes for computing biogenic emissions of isoprene and NO. Our best estimates of global emissions include among others 42 Tg <b>N</b> yr- 1 <b>for</b> <b>NO</b> x (21 Tg N yr- 1 from fossil fuel combustion, 12 Tg N yr- 1 from biomass burning, 6 Tg N yr- 1 from soils, and 3 Tg N yr- 1 from lightning), and 37 Tg C yr- 1 for acetone (1 Tg C yr- 1 from industry, 9 Tg C yr- 1 from biomass burning, 15 Tg C yr- 1 from vegetation, and 12 Tg C yr- 1 from oxidation of propane and higher alkanes) ...|$|R
