40|$|Background and Purpose: Variation in wood is {{a common}} phenomenon. Eliciting {{information}} on the pattern and extent of variation in wood properties is crucial to knowing the end use of wood species. This to a larger extent helps in the efficient and sustainable utilization of wood. Pinus caribaea has been internationally affirmed to be suitable for the manufacturing of pulp and paper. Since its introduction into Nigeria, the possibility for its use for pulp and paper has been grossly undermined because of the non-functional paper mills in Nigeria. Hence, the established plantations of the species in the country have gradually been exploited for timber. In order to ensure the efficient use of the species for structural purposes, it is therefore pertinent to understand the variation pattern in its anatomical and physical properties. Materials and Methods: Five trees of 31 year old P. caribaea wood were harvested at Shasha Forest Reserve, South-West Nigeria. Bolts of 50 cm in length were obtained from each felled tree at breast height (1. 3 m). Discs of 5 cm thickness were obtained from each bolt which {{were used for the}} anatomical investigation. The bolts were used for the investigation of the physical properties. The data generated were subjected to ANOVA and Regression Analysis. Results: The results show that considerable differences exist in the anatomical properties among trees (p 0. 05). Both the physical and anatomical properties differ insignificantly within the tree (p> 0. 05). Tree’s basic density, tracheid wall thickness and lumen diameter only explained 49 % of the variation in the preservative absorption within the tree (R 2 = 0. 4884, P-value= 0. 053), re-emphasizing the major role played by bordered pits in the permeability of softwoods. Conclusions: Due to the high preservative absorption observed using a <b>non-pressure</b> <b>treatment,</b> it is concluded that the species is very porous. Its porosity may pose a disadvantage when moisture absorption is concerned. Thus, it is recommended that the wood be properly treated in order to reduce its potentials in absorbing excessive moisture during service...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} {{undertaken}} {{to study how}} storage conditions (at constant temperatures of 2 ± 1 and 12 ± 1 °C and temperature fluctuations at 7 ± 5 °C) affect microbial development {{and the production of}} biogenic amines in vacuum-packaged cooked sliced ham subjected to high pressure (400 MPa/ 10 min/ 30 °C). Initially, the product exhibited low levels of contamination. Microbiological changes during storage depend on the processing (<b>non-pressure</b> and pressure <b>treatment)</b> and the chilled storage conditions. Generally, microbial growth in pressurized samples was similar to that in the non-pressurized samples, although the total viable count and lactic flora were lower and growth was delayed. Processing and storage conditions affected the formation of each amine differently. The most important changes were in tyramine, which formed more quickly in non-pressurized products stored at 12 °C and with temperature fluctuations. The formation of biogenic amines in these products can be prevented not only by ensuring good manufacturing practices and applying high pressure but also by ensuring the right chilled storage conditions. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
