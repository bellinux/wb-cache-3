It was not until 1971 when an agreement was reached to reduce the permanent storage pool at Los Esteros.

This name came from Boulder Canyon and yet the dam is built in Black Canyon. How did all this name confusion happen? By 1920, Government hydrographers and geologists had been looking for 18 years for the best place to put a dam on the Colorado River. Based on preliminary reconnaissance by government engineers, Boulder Canyon was chosen in April 1920. Thus when California Congressman Phil Swing and California Senator Hiram Johnson introduced their legislation for construction <b>of</b> a <b>dam</b> in 1923, they called it the Boulder Canyon Project Act. That site eventually proved less favorable than Black Canyon, but the name Boulder Canyon stuck. The press and the public had begun referring to the project as the Boulder Canyon Dam and later Boulder Dam and the name became so associated with the project that it was hard to change. " [...] unknown author (part 1 of 2).; "On September 17, 1930, Interior Secretary Ray Wilbur, after driving a spike into the beginning of the new railroad from Las Vegas to the dam, gave a short speech at the end of which he announced that he had the honor <b>of</b> <b>naming</b> this great project Hoover Dam. Immediately the anti-Hoover press was up in arms about changing the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dam</b> by executive fiat. Others questioned the propriety <b>of</b> <b>naming</b> the project after an incumbent president. The name became a political football for the next seventeen years. On May 8, 1933, new Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes in one of his first administrative acts declared that the dam would be called Boulder Dam, a 'fine, rugged, individual name'. During the dedication <b>of</b> the <b>dam</b> on September 30, 1935, Ickes used the name Boulder Dam five times in his speech. President Franklin Roosevelt finished his address by congratulating the men who created 'Boulder Dam'. But, finally, the issue was put to rest on April 30, 1947, when a joint resolution of Congress permanently decreed the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dam</b> to be Hoover Dam.
