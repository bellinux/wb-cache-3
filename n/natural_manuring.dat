30|$|Conversely, a {{decrease}} in the area of ban oak may be attributed to heavy anthropogenic pressure on oak forests in hill states which results in indiscriminate lopping of the species. Ban oak is a multipurpose species having a good fodder and fuel quality; hence, it is under a high biotic stress in Himalayan forests (Saxena et al. 1978; Tiwari and Singh 1982; Bankoti et al. 1986; Joshi and Tiwari, 2011). Gouri et al. (2004), reported scarcity of fodder in Himachal Pradesh due to factors like forest fire, decrease in grasslands and mounting land utilisation pressure due to the adoption of horticulture. This has resulted in people keeping fewer cattle thereby affecting the availability of cow dung and <b>natural</b> <b>manure.</b> As a result the fuel requirements which were to some extent met through cow dung cakes, are now solely dependent on forests (Gouri et al. 2004) such as those of oak which are facing the problem of severe degradation. The total annual consumption of rural domestic fuel in the state is around 2.5 to 3.2 million tones, half of which is extracted from public forests (Singh and Sikka 1992). Decrease in the area of ban oak may also be due to poor regeneration observed in these forests compared to forests of chir pine in ground surveys of the study area. According to Bhandari et al. (1997), the regeneration potential of Pinus roxburghii is greater than that of Quercus species.|$|R

Experiment I was established in 1972 on grey brown podzolic soil; experiment II, in 1973 on brown soil. In both experiments crops were cultivated in a 7 -year rotation, with a 75 % share of cereals. The experimental samples were taken from the top layer of soil after 36 (experiment I) and 35 (experiment II) years following the establishment of the experiments. It was demonstrated that the presence of phenolic compounds in the soils was significantly dependent on the contents of organic C and total N, type of soil and the type and dose of used fertilizers. In grey brown podzolic soil, the content of total phenolic compounds was at a lower level than the content found in brown soil. Multiannual fertilization contributed to an increase in the content of total phenolic compounds in relation to the values obtained in control objects, which was particularly reflected in the soil originating from objects fertilized with slurry applied at a dose being equivalent to manure in terms of the amount of introduced organic carbon.

Field sealing of geotextiles liners was confirmed using a 20 micrometers fabric subjected to swine slurries of various total solids (TS) concentrations ranging from 1 % to 10 %. Infiltration rates indicate that satisfactory sealing requires slurries with a minimum TS content of 4 %. As well, higher TS levels favour a longer lasting manure seal at the fabric surface. Sterilized manure of 5 % total solids (TS) used to simulate cool field conditions or poor biological sealing mechanisms showed that the sterilized manure retained a constant infiltration rate after 1000 hours.

40|$|Better {{soil for}} better food {{supplements}} Cue: A low input garden {{has so many}} advantages: less work and good yields, to name just two. But what you put into the soil can determine the quality of what {{you get out of}} the soil. Nitrogen-rich crops can feed the soil with nitrogen, which help following crops to grow stronger. Adding composted manure and other organic matter will feed the soil with minerals which the fruits and vegetables can absorb. Silundika AIDS Health Council is running a training programme in Zimbabwe to teach a community in the town of Bulawayo how to set up their own low input gardens. Ivy Sibanda is the project Director, and the enthusiast behind the work. And she took Busani Bafana on a walk through the plots to see the plants and meet the people who grow them. IN:	?What is the starting point? OUT:	?vegetables that I need. ? DUR?N:	 2 ? 48 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: From Zimbabwe that was farmer Elizabeth Thebe ending that report. Try and look for a use for everything in your garden ? that is her message. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Bafana	What is the starting point in the soil preparation for this low input garden? Sibanda	They do not need a lot of work. First of all you prepare your bed by digging, level your soil, make water pits where you can hold water so that it does not run away from the soil. Bafana	How can people who live with HIV and AIDS improve the content of the minerals and the vitamins in the soil they use to grow these vegetables? Sibanda	They can improve by crop rotation. Usually when you have ploughed some legumes in one bed the next time you put spinach on the other side, you put lets say carrots so that they rotate to improve the soil. Bafana	How then I want to find out what kind of manure can be used and why? Sibanda	<b>Natural</b> <b>manure</b> can be used. Bafana	So then do you mean to say that <b>natural</b> <b>manure</b> is healthy in a way that it is absorbed through the vegetables that are grown in that particular patch of land? Sibanda	Yes they are easily absorbed. Bafana	What low foods then can people living with HIV and AIDS be advised to grow? Sibanda	They can be advised to grow foods like beans, they are easily grown, they do not need much labour. Spinach for iron as their bodies really need a lot of iron, green vegetables, cabbage, the Chinese cabbage which takes a short time to ripen, like within three months they can reap and start again, to rotate again. Bafana	There are a number of your members who are here, can I talk to some of your members to find out how they have benefited? Sibanda	Yes you can do. Bafana	Good afternoon to you. Please could you tell us your name? Thebe	My name is Elizabeth Thebe. Bafana	How is the training that you got in low input gardening helped improve the soil content of your garden? Thebe	This really has helped me because I used to take all the weeds from my garden, the leaves from my garden I used to throw them away and burn them but for now I am really keeping those because they are really helpful. I make all the compost, the compost that I get from my garden, the leaves from my trees that I do use them for the compost. All the weeds like the blackjacks, boil the blackjack, use it in my garden. Any of the soils in your yard must not be just lying there unused, you can use them. Now I see that I am making a lot of vegetables from my yard only, I cannot buy vegetables on the streets whatever. Whatever I grow, my pumpkins, I grow my spinach, carrots in that area that I live in. I learnt that that small space of mine can give me all the vegetables that I need.

However, phosphorus reductions with phytase may vary from farm to farm due to feed ingredient variation and amounts, an incorrect ration formulation for phosphorus, and possibly the amount of manure dilution with wastewater. Manure management plans on a phosphorus basis will be easier to implement with a phytase diet. Therefore, because swine premixes are commercially available with phytase, swine producers should take advantage of reducing manure phosphorus levels.

In the very earliest days of my islands' existence, indeed, a few stray feathered fowls of the air were driven ashore here by violent storms, {{at a time when}} vegetation had not yet begun to clothe the naked pumice and volcanic rock; but these, of course, perished for want of food, as did also a few later arrivals, who came under stress of weather at the period when only ferns, lichens, and mosses had as yet obtained a foothold on the young archipelago. Sea-birds, of course, soon found out our rocks; but as they live off fish only, they contributed little more than rich beds of guano to the permanent colonising of the islands. As well as I can remember, the land-snails were the earliest truly terrestrial casuals that managed to pick up a stray livelihood in these first colonial days of the archipelago. They came oftenest in the egg, sometimes clinging to water-logged leaves cast up by storms, sometimes hidden in the bark of floating driftwood, and sometimes swimming free on the open ocean. In one case, as I recall to myself well, a swallow, driven off from the Portuguese coast, a little before the Glacial period had begun to whiten the distant mountains of central and northern Europe, fell exhausted at last upon the shore of Terceira. There were no insects then for the poor bird to feed upon, so it died of starvation and weariness before the day was out; but a little earth that clung in a pellet to one of its feet contained the egg of a land-shell, while the prickly seed of a common Spanish plant was entangled among the winged feathers by its hooked awns. The egg hatched out, and became the parent of a large brood of minute snails, which, outliving the cold spell of the Ice Age, had developed into a very distinct type in the long period that intervened before the advent of man in the islands; while the seed sprang up on the <b>natural</b> <b>manure</b> heap afforded by the swallow's decaying body, and clinging to the valleys during the Glacial Age on the hill-tops, gave birth in due season {{to one of the most}} markedly indigenous of our Terceira plants.|$|R

In certain cases, the pit is cemented and in others, it is simply a hole dug in the ground. The animals receive a health check and surveillance (vermifuge and trypanocide treatments), are watered once a day, and fed on stalks from the bush and from maize. The major supplement given is cotton seed. The system is seen as a 'technology package' which results in organic manure for fertiliser and for producing biogas. The cowshed system is viable, {{according to a recent study}} conducted on twelve family small-holdings in villages around the town of Tambacounda. Sales of milk and the production of manure are well in excess of the costs of the health treatments and the cotton seed. Profits are even higher for farmers that have concreted cowsheds. Still, this system's success depends heavily on Sodefitex's cotton seed price subsidies. Even so, manure sheds help to conserve natural resources, which benefits rural people. For this reason alone this innovation deserves to be supported as an integral part of the cotton production chain, and it should help maintain productivity over the long term.

Finally, phytase-treated soil, manure, and soil-manure mixtures were evaluated for their P-supplying capacity to wheat plants grown under greenhouse conditions. Treating cattle manure with phytases stabilized in nanoclays resulted in a significant (P a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0. 05) increase of inorganic P in soil extracts (NaOH-EDTA and Olsen). The use of phytase-treated cattle manure increased dry weights by 10 % and the P concentration by 39 % in wheat plants grown under greenhouse conditions, which is equivalent to a P fertilizer rate of about 150 kg of P per hectare. The inoculation of cattle manure with beta-propeller phytase-producing bacteria led to an similar to 10 % increase in inorganic P in the manure extracts.

40|$|Nitrate {{leaching}} from agricultural {{sources is}} a worldwide concern and in Europe {{a large part}} of farmed areas are affected by nitrate pollution since decades. In Italy, the Po River valley is the largest and more intensively farmed alluvial plain, heavily impacted by agricultural pollution and especially by NO 3 - groundwater contamination and surface water eutrophication. With the enactment of the European Directive for water protection (2000 / 60 CE), {{a large portion of the}} Po river valley has been declared vulnerable to nitrate from agricultural sources and limitations to the use of N fertilizers have been applied. However, in agricultural practices, the types of soils and soil tillage, different crops and irrigation techniques and different nitrogen fertilizers, which may be synthetic, as ammonium nitrate and urea, or <b>natural,</b> as <b>manures</b> and sludge from different animal farming, form a variety of terms emphasizing site specificity of WFD application and results. Moreover, the general knowledge of key factors governing patterns and processes of N transport and transformations through the vadose zone to the water table are not fully clarified. Within this multidisciplinary framework, for any applied research finalised to reduce nitrogen losses, it is essential to fix a benchmark to star from, which in our view is aquifer recharge assessment, i. e. to quantify water resources and flux toward aquifers. Presently, the most effective tool to quantify recharge flux is to model the unsaturated soil water dynamics, although this process faces many challenges in field conditions. In order to identify the dominant processes affecting nitrate leaching in the Po River Delta area, a series of tracer tests were performed to determine conservative mass transfer and the fate and transport of nitrogen species. Results highlight the reliability of the use of conservative tracers and numerical modeling jointly, to understand nitrate mass transfer rate and mass balance. For the practical interest of WFD application, this approach has evidenced that in the sandy soil, more permeable and intrinsically more vulnerable, the relatively low amount of organic matter lasting from manure use in the previous year, was sufficient to prevent nitrate leaking, by removing the excess via denitrification. This result highlights the need to pay attention to the kind of manure used and to the relative degradation kinetics which may also be heavily affected by farming type, organic or industrial. This last term, in fact, other than impacting water quality for the presence of hormones and other undesired chemicals, may influence organic matter and nitrogen mineralization rates, interfering with bacterial activities due to the presence of antibiotics...|$|R
40|$|In the {{production}} of greenhouse vegetables, {{the decline of the}} wholesale price of tomato and cucumber has impaired the profitability of greenhouse enterprises. New species are sought for production to improve the profitability. In Finland only one quarter of {{the production}} of sweet pepper is domestic and the proportion of organic production is small. There is a remarkable market for domestic sweet pepper. However, the shortage of nutrients and water as well as the tolerance of stress are limiting the yield of sweet pepper. In the organic greenhouse production commercial liquid fertilizers are used to insure the availability of nutrients during the formation of the yield. They are significantly more expensive than chemical fertilizers. The cost of supplemental liquid fertilizer could be reduced by developing a fertilizer based on animal urine. Urine is commonly available for free on farms. On the other hand, the sales of urine could when proven a functional liquid fertilizer, in principle make a significant source of income of the same order of the income from milk, when the price of urine would be derived from the price of the nutrients in the organic liquid fertilizers. Some entrepreneurs have already tried to use urine as a liquid fertilizer with great success. In the greenhouse production the availability of nutrients, the uptake of water, the growth of plants, flowering and the tolerance of stress could be improved by mycorrhizal inoculation. Actually, almost all the plants cultivated in the greenhouse; vegetables, spices and berries (except cabbages e. g. rucola) benefit from mycorrhiza when the conditions for the function of these fungi are optimal. Because mycorrhiza supplies the plants especially with phosphorus there is not much use of mycorrhiza when the phosphorus content of the media is high. Mycorrhiza works best when the solubility of phosphorus in the media is low. On the contrary, a high nitrogen content does not impair the function of mycorrhiza. From the Finnish soil, effective mycorrhiza strains have been isolated but these are not yet developed to commercial preparations. However, there have been positive experience of their advantages e. g. in spices, strawberry and flowers. The aim of this part of study is to develop an animal originating affordable ecological liquid fertilizer for production of organic sweet pepper in greenhouses and clarify the feasibility of mycorrhiza inoculation in {{the production of}} spices and vegetables on different medias. Materials and methods MTT Agricultural Engineering develops in co-operation with the University of Helsinki an animal urine originated liquid fertilizer suitable for organic greenhouse production. There is in {{the first phase of the}} research a test in a greenhouse lasting whole the production period (approx. 6 months) where 1) bovine urine as a supplemental fertilizer, 2) pig urine as a supplemental fertilizer, 3) a commercial organic liquid fertilizer by Biolan as a supplemental fertilizer, 4) media fertilized with chicken <b>manure</b> (<b>natural</b> fertilizer by Biolan) and 5) media fertilized with chicken <b>manure</b> (<b>natural</b> fertilizer by Biolan) with a commercial organic liquid fertilizer by Biolan as a supplemental fertilizer are tested.

More and more people have no access to protein. In addressing the first Millennium Development Goal; reduction of poverty and hunger, low-cost strategies are sought that can ameliorate food scarcity {{in many parts of the}} region principally in the drier seasons. Fish culture in seasonal wetland fish ponds 'Fingerponds' on the shores of Lake Victoria provides a wise use option for the management of natural wetlands while at the same time improving food security for resource-poor communities. The core objective of this dissertation is to evaluate the functioning and management of Fingerponds based on the application of <b>natural</b> organic <b>manure</b> and the use of artificial substrates. This thesis determines how nutrient dynamics and primary productivity regulate fish production in these systems and examines the underlying factors that determine the variability in pond water quality and fish production. The thesis provides suitable management practices that are easily adoptable by resource-poor communities. Eight Fingerponds (each 192 m 2) were constructed in two villages (Gaba and Walukuba) on the northern shores of Lake Victoria, Uganda. In 2002, the wetland ecotone (i. e. ponds, wetland and lake inshore zones) characteristics were determined and their potential for fish culture ascertained. Natural stocking of ponds occurred in April/May 2003. This research demonstrates that Fingerponds provide a conducive environment for the culture of fish which is dependant on soil conditions, seasonal flooding, natural stocking, and water quality. Seasonal floods enable fish from lakes or rivers to migrate to the ponds and their levels and duration determine the fish species stocked in the ponds. An assessment of the ecological processes revealed buffering capacity and sedimentation/re-suspension as the main ecological processes determining water quality in these freshwater wetland ecosystems. To sustain good fish growth throughout the dry season in Fingerponds, natural food production for fish was enhanced through the application of organic manure (chicken and fermented green manure) and use of artificial substrates for periphyton development. Firstly, the effects of chicken manure application on primary productivity and water quality were examined. The experiments revealed that rates of chicken manure 520 to 1563 kg ha- 1 applied fortnightly increased phytoplankton primary productivity without adversely affecting pond water quality. Furthermore, concentrations of oxygen and ammonia were maintained within limits acceptable for fish survival and growth. The mam limitations to primary productivity phytoplankton and periphyton) in these flood-fed ponds were inorganic clay turbidity, decreasing water levels and nitrogen limitation. Secondly, use of bamboo and local wetland plants {Raphia, papyrus and Phragmites) revealed that bamboo and Phragmites substrates were the most suitable for periphyton development. In the presence of artificial substrates, primary productivity doubled. This study revealed that Fingerponds can play a major role in ameliorating food security for resource-poor communities through the provision of protein (fish). A maxirnum fish yield of up to 2. 67 tonnes ha 1 yr- 1 (i. e. per capita fish consumption of 6. 2 kg over a 310 day growth period) was attained from periphyton-based organically manured Fingerponds. However, the study also reveals that fish growth in flood-fed Fingerponds is limited by high reproduction/recruitment of fingerlings (leading to high feeding pressure and subsequent stunting of fish) hence small sized fish; low water levels, high light limitation due to inorganic clay turbidity (hence lowered primary productivity) and low zooplankton biomass. Manual sexing of fish as a management strategy results in an increased ratio of male to female fish. Furthermore, periodic removal of female fish and fingerlings is unsuccessful in curbing reproduction. Fingerponds can be distinctively separated into two types: typical lake-floodplain Fingerponds and those fed also with inflowing rivers in this case referred to as river floodplain Fingerponds. A dynamic model was used to simulate fish growth in these ponds. The model was able to capture the dynamics of hydrology, nutrients and fish in the two types of Fingerponds, demonstrating that similar fundamental processes underlie fish production in these systems. Model fish yields of up to 2 S 00 kg ha" 1 and water quality predictions were comparable to field measurements. Using the model, nitrogen budgets for Fingerponds were calculated and quantitative estimates of all process flows were given. The model though preliminary once subjected to sensitivity analysis and validation can be used as a management tool. Main knowledge gaps pertain to light limitation of primary productivity and the food selectivity of tilapia and their fingerlings. In its current state, the model is a research tool that identifies knowledge gaps and can be applied to frame hypotheses for further applied research. Ultimately, the model can contribute to improving the management of Fingerponds. Finally in conclusion, the research has demonstrated that with correct management, enhanced fish production in Fingerponds is possible...|$|R
40|$| in some villages {{virtually}} every household {{has at least}} one pond. Most ponds in Luapula are less than 200 m 2 and at present two species are produced: Tilapia rendalli and, to a lesser extent, Oreocromis macrochir. Inputs to fish ponds are largely plant materials, both agricultural byproducts and <b>natural</b> vegetation. Animal <b>manure</b> is also used where available but is generally scarce. Climatic factors limit production to the rainy season (September/October to March) and current outputs are extremely variable. The best yields are estimated to be about 500 kg/ha/ year, although most active farmers produce significantly less. Nevertheless, despite this seemingly low productivity, many farmers declare themselves to be happy with their ponds. Less encouraging are reports that although many ponds are being dug in Luapula, management practices are often very poor. Ponds are badly sited or incorrectly constructed, fish are fed only infrequently despite the availability of food, compost cribs are either not constructed or are poorly maintained, and ponds are left unstocked. Evidently much has to be learned about which farmers adopt integrated agriculture-aquaculture systems and what factors influence the success of some and the failure of others. Success or failure? Some farmers will recognise the benefits of integrating fish into their farming system, while others may not feel that they can cope with the added workload, investment or more complex management. Studies by ALCOM in Zambia show that farmers with the fewest options for employing their time, land and water are often early adopters and achieve the highest yields of fish. This is advantageous because the poorer the farmer's household, the more likely that the increased income from fish production will ensure a long-term increase in productivity in the farm as a whole. Conversely, if a farmer is fully occupied and already earning a good income from the land and water available to him or her, there is little justification for persuading him to take up fish farming. However, some successful farmers will have the imagination, financial resources and energy to develop their farming business even further by integrating aquaculture into their crop and/or livestock enterprise. Research workers from the Universities of Sussex and Stirling are undertaking work on why some farmers in Luapula Province, who have the potential to undertake fish farming, fail to do so. The indications are that those who adopt fish farming tend to be slightly better educated, slightly better off financially, {{and are more likely to}} be male, than non-fish farmers. Evidence shows that women have been slower to take up fish farming than men and, overall, relatively few Luapula women have ponds in their own right. There are signs that one major constraint for women is the difficulty they have in constructing their own ponds: there seems to be a general unwillingness by menfolk to assist with pond construction while the women already have other domestic and farming responsibilities and so have little time to spare. Women may also not have direct access to tools for digging. It is not yet clear what the role of emergent fish farmers in communities where aquaculture is a strategy for survival at subsistence level will be. There is the potential for some to specialize as suppliers of fingerlings to others to their mutual benefit, but there is a danger also that a few 'elite' farmers will take over the prime means of production and dominate fish production to the detriment of their neighbours. However, this is probably less of a risk where fish farming is a part of an integrated system because, once established, external inputs are minimal. The future The current ways in which farmers in many ACP countries use their land and water can neither meet the demands for food and income, nor for environmental conservation. Intensification of food production is required, but without the usual environmental degradation. And yet any system that fulfills these criteria must be within the management and financial capabilities of large numbers of resource-poor farmers. Integrating fish farming with agriculture appears to be such an option. Aquaculture can be integrated with agriculture to the benefit of farmers and the environment but it is a new production system with many aspects that are totally novel to the great majority of rural people in ACP countries. If such a new system is to be successful government assistance will be essential for training, initial supply of fingerlings, advice on management while farmers gain experience and encouragement of the less advantaged who could benefit most. There is a growing database of practical experience to draw on from ICLARM, ALCOM, FAO projects in francophone Africa and private enterprises in Nigeria. The efforts that governments should put into aquaculture will depend on several factors, including its expected contribution to economic growth, by raising consumption of fish. However, an additional economic factor that must be taken into account is the synergistic effect on food production that will result from integrating fish farming with agriculture, and its beneficial effects on the environment by reducing, and even reversing, degradation. Present systems of farming will not meet the projected food needs for most ACP countries in the twenty-first century. Where sufficient water is available and soils are suitably water retentive, the integration of aquaculture with agriculture could [...] ...|$|R
