5|$|To have {{qualified}} for the national team under IIHF rules, a player must have met several criteria. He must be {{a citizen of the}} nation, and be under the jurisdiction of that national association. Players are allowed to change which national team they represent, providing they fulfill the IIHF criteria. If participating {{for the first time in}} an IIHF event, the player was required to have played two consecutive years in the national competition of the <b>new</b> <b>country</b> without playing in another country. If the player has already played for a national team before, he may switch countries if he is a citizen of the <b>new</b> <b>country,</b> and has played for four consecutive years in the national competition of the <b>new</b> <b>country.</b> This switch may happen only once in the player's life.|$|E

However, he did not feature in the 3–0 victory.|$|E

5|$|After the {{successful}} American War of Independence, the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized {{the independence of}} the newly formed United State and set the terms of peace, ceding British North American territories south of the Great Lakes to the <b>new</b> <b>country.</b> The American war of independence also caused a large out-migration of Loyalists the settlers who had fought against American independence. Many moved to Canada, particularly Atlantic Canada, where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories. New Brunswick was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes. To accommodate the influx of English-speaking Loyalists in Central Canada, the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province of Canada into French-speaking Lower Canada (later Quebec) and English-speaking Upper Canada (later Ontario), granting each its own elected legislative assembly.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{emergence}} of <b>new</b> <b>countries</b> as contributors to technology generation {{in the world economy}} and assesses the relationship between this and globalisation (through trade, inward FDI and international migration). It considers two measures of technology generation, viz. a country's share of licensing revenues and of foreign origin patenting in the US, thus covering different phases and aspects of technological catch-up across countries. The paper uses a novel index to track the influence of <b>new</b> <b>countries</b> as technology generators in these datasets and uses time series techniques to understand the causal relationship between globalisation and {{the emergence of}} new technology producers. Our findings suggest a role for increasing international direct investment as a factor causing the emergence of <b>new</b> <b>countries</b> with the higher level competitiveness associated with patenting, but not in the recent surge of <b>new</b> <b>countries</b> with the basic capabilities needed to become licensors in the world economy. However, an increase in the international spread of the subsidiary sources of the patenting activity of multinationals appears to follow periods when the world economy becomes less open to trade...|$|R

Marques de Sousa was sent to Montevideo to serve under field marshal (present-day divisional general) Manuel Jorge Rodrigues, who commanded a Brazilian force temporarily stationed in the <b>new</b> <b>country.</b> On 29 March 1829, Marques de Sousa was made brevet (acting) major, and, on 28 August 1830, he was placed in command of the 6th company of 4th Regiment of Light Cavalry. Stationed in Rio Grande do Sul, the unit had previously been commanded by his father and his paternal grandfather.|$|E

During his work, he was arrested by Dutch colonial authorities and expelled from the country. Kahin received a Ph.D. in political science from Johns Hopkins University in 1951. His dissertation, titled Nationalism and Revolution in Indonesia , is considered a classic on Indonesian history.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald and his {{government}} faced immediate problems upon formation of the <b>new</b> <b>country.</b> Much work remained to do in creating a federal government. Nova Scotia was already threatening {{to withdraw from the}} union; the Intercolonial Railway, which would both conciliate the Maritimes and bind them closer to the rest of Canada, was not yet built. Anglo-American relations were in a poor state, and Canadian foreign relations were matters handled from London. The withdrawal of the Americans in 1866 from the Reciprocity Treaty had increased tariffs on Canadian goods in US markets. Much of present-day Canada remained outside confederation—in addition to the separate colonies of Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, and British Columbia, which remained governed by the British, vast areas in the north and west belonged to the British and to the Hudson's Bay Company. American and British opinion was that the experiment of Confederation would quickly unravel, and the nascent nation absorbed by the United States.|$|E

In 2010, Amadou Koundoul, who was the assistant coach for the UC Irvine Anteaters men's basketball team at the time, saw N'Diaye participate in a pick-up game in a gymnasium at Dakar. He asked him {{to travel to the}} United States, and N'Diaye accepted the offer. He arrived in the US without knowing how to speak English.

5|$|Nefarious explores how sex {{trafficking}} {{differs from}} country to country, and suggests that all the victims are both psychologically and emotionally enslaved. One of the initial assertions in the film is that slavery has not been abolished but is increasing, and that half of this slavery is sexual in nature. Nefarious identifies political corruption and difficult socioeconomic situations as elements that prevent sex slaves from escaping exploitation, and suggests that most victims do not survive {{for more than seven}} years after initially being trafficked. While the violent acquisition of sex slaves depicted in the first sequence of the film does occur in reality, Jimmy Stewart of Charisma wrote that most girls who are sexually trafficked in Europe are recruited through a fraudulent offer of employment and an improved lifestyle overseas, neither of which ultimately materializes in the <b>new</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E

In New York City and other locations, new citizens learned {{they were expected to}} register for the draft to fight for their <b>new</b> <b>country.</b> Black men were excluded from the draft as they were largely not considered citizens, and wealthier white men could pay for substitutes.|$|E
