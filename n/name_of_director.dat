40|$|Tags are {{a useful}} tool for film search and {{recommendation}} because they contain valuable information in a compressed form. However, manual tagging is time-consuming and needs the involvement of many people. We are working on automated cross-modal video classification algorithms based on signal processing. These algorithms assign subcategories to film scenes. The subcategories are useful to cluster scenes in different groups and therefore can also be used as tags. In this paper, we point out the advantages of tags generated by automated video classification and present the determination of five possible categories with their associated subcategories. The determination was obtained with five group studies to ensure that the categories fit the way humans classify. Because they are based on the audiovisual content and do not include additional external information like <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>director</b> or year of production, they are suited for automated classification as well. The final categories are called Dynamic, Valence, Interaction, Suspense and Essential Features. They contain between two and nine subcategories...|$|E

They started with the list of 200 largest production companies and 50 largest financial companies. For various reasons, they reduced the list to 55 production companies and 15 financial companies. They collected the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>directors</b> <b>of</b> these companies for the years 1960, 1964, 1969, 1972, 1976 and 1980. In case of mergers they used data {{of the most important}} partner. The database contains information about the name, function and title <b>of</b> the <b>directors.</b> The database also shows the years in which a person is director at a particular company. Due to a large number of mergers between 1964 and 1969, the number of included companies reduced from 86 to 70. Since 1964 the number <b>of</b> multiple <b>directors</b> is stable around 160. Between 1960 and 1980 there were only 405 different multiple directors...|$|R
