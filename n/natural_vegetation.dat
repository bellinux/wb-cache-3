5|$|Basalt, mostly {{covered by}} silt in the uplands and {{sediment}} in the lowlands, underlies the Balch Creek watershed. The {{upper part of}} the watershed includes private residential land, the Audubon Society of Portland nature sanctuary, and part of Forest Park. Mixed conifer forest of Coast Douglas-fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock with a well-developed understory of shrubs and flowering plants is the <b>natural</b> <b>vegetation.</b> Sixty-two species of mammals and more than 112species of birds use Forest Park. A small population of coastal cutthroat trout resides in the stream, which in 2005 was the only major water body in Portland that met state standards for bacteria, temperature, and dissolved oxygen.|$|E
5|$|The area {{occupied}} by Kent Ridge Park and the National University of Singapore was {{formerly known as}} Pasir Panjang Ridge, and was originally a lowland evergreen rainforest. The park's <b>natural</b> <b>vegetation</b> now consists of groves of Tembusu, Acacias and Dillenias. When the first settlers arrived in Singapore in the early 19th century, they grew crops such as rubber, pepper, gambier and pineapple on the ridge. During World War II, it {{was used as a}} fortress by the British in the defence of Singapore. Many of these plantations were either abandoned or destroyed during the Japanese Occupation (1942–1945), which allowed such crops to grow wild.|$|E
40|$|Blown sand is a serous {{problem in}} the {{district}} facing the Japan Sea where seasonal wind is very strong in winter. In order to prevent the blown sand, the construction technique using <b>natural</b> <b>vegetations</b> had been developed. The growth of the <b>natural</b> <b>vegetations</b> is encouraged by the improvement of sand ingredients in this method. The effects of the method were investigated by the field survey and observation at the seashore in Kashiwazaki, Niigata Prefecture. As a result, {{the increase in the}} ground level by the sedimentary sand, which was caught by the vegetations, was observed in contrast with the natural beach, It was confirmed that this method is effective on the growth of the <b>natural</b> <b>vegetations</b> and the prevention of the blown sand...|$|R

5|$|The city's {{design was}} {{influenced}} by the garden city movement and incorporates significant areas of <b>natural</b> <b>vegetation.</b> The growth and development of Canberra were hindered by the World Wars and the Great Depression, which exacerbated a series of planning disputes and the ineffectiveness of a procession of bodies that were created in turn to oversee the development of the city. The national capital emerged as a thriving city after World War II, as Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies championed its development and the National Capital Development Commission was formed with executive powers. Although the Australian Capital Territory is now self-governing, the Commonwealth Government retains some influence through the National Capital Authority.|$|E
5|$|The {{major threat}} for crested and marbled newts is habitat loss. This {{concerns}} especially breeding sites, which are lost through the upscaling and intensification of agriculture, drainage, urban sprawl, and artificial flooding regimes (affecting {{in particular the}} Danube crested newt). Especially in the southern ranges, exploitation of groundwater and decreasing spring rain, possibly caused by global warming, threaten breeding ponds. Aquatic habitats are also degraded through pollution with agricultural pesticides and fertiliser. Introduction of crayfish and predatory fish threatens larval development; the Chinese sleeper {{has been a major}} concern in Eastern Europe. Exotic plants can also degrade habitats: the swamp stonecrop replaces <b>natural</b> <b>vegetation</b> and overshadows waterbodies in the United Kingdom, and its hard leaves are unsuitable for egg-laying to crested newts.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of the 20th century saw {{increasingly}} sophisticated educational, visitor service, and interpretation services. Botanical gardens started to cater for many interests and their displays reflected this, often including botanical exhibits on themes of evolution, ecology or taxonomy, horticultural displays of attractive flowerbeds and herbaceous borders, plants from different parts of the world, special collections of plant groups such as bamboos or roses, and specialist glasshouse collections such as tropical plants, alpine plants, cacti and orchids, as well as the traditional herb gardens and medicinal plants. Specialised gardens like the Palmengarten in Frankfurt, Germany (1869), one of the world's leading orchid and succulent plant collections, have been very popular. There was a renewed interest in gardens of indigenous plants and areas dedicated to <b>natural</b> <b>vegetation.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{trend towards}} more {{intensive}} farming {{began to be}} partially reversed {{by the end of}} the century as more environmentally friendly practices were encouraged by government and European Union grants. For example, Richard Zawadzki, owner of Balfour Mains (the largest farm on the island), ceased to breed livestock (instead keeping animals bred elsewhere) and grew less grain (some barley is still grown on the farm). Instead, some of the land is now managed under a Habitat Creation Scheme, which aims to encourage <b>natural</b> <b>vegetation,</b> wild flowers and nesting birds by limiting grazing and reducing the use of chemical fertilisers.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, gardens became {{focused on}} the plant conservation. The Botanic Gardens Conservation Secretariat was {{established}} by the IUCN, and the World Conservation Union in 1987 {{with the aim of}} coordinating the plant conservation efforts of botanical gardens around the world. It maintains a database of rare and endangered species in botanical gardens' living collections. Many gardens hold ex situ conservation collections that preserve genetic variation. These may be held as: seeds dried and stored at low temperature, or in tissue culture (such as the Kew Millennium Seedbank); as living plants, including those that are of special horticultural, historical or scientific interest (such as those held by the NCCPG in the United Kingdom); or by managing and preserving areas of <b>natural</b> <b>vegetation.</b> Collections are often held and cultivated with the intention of reintroduction to their original habitats. The Center for Plant Conservation at St Louis, Missouri coordinates the conservation of native North American species.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{discussed}} {{the rank of}} <b>natural</b> grade of <b>vegetation</b> on the forest communities around the Lake Teganuma in the previous report (Hukusima et al. 1981). In the present paper, the actual distribution of the <b>natural</b> grade of <b>vegetation</b> {{in the same area}} is studied by making the distribution map. The map revealed interesting facts on the distribution of different grades. Two regions, i. e. Shonan and Abiko areas along the shoreline, generally showed a higher rank of <b>natural</b> grade of <b>vegetation</b> than the Abiko region. The forests occuring on the slope of Shonan and Abiko regions consisted of different distributional patterns of the <b>natural</b> grade of <b>vegetation,</b> and in general were occupied by the higher rank. The Abiko region which is in a more advanced stage of development as residential area showed a characteristic distributional pattern of the <b>natural</b> grade of <b>vegetation,</b> forming a number of blocks with various grade of composition. The location of each block in the region appeared to be influenced by human habitation. Based upon the findings, the following suggestions are made for forest conservation in this area. With regard to the Abiko region, an emphasis must be placed on the improvement of the quality of forests for each block employing the concept of the <b>natural</b> grade of <b>vegetation.</b> On the other hand, an emphasis should be placed on the maintenance of the proper distribution of the plant communities in case of the Shonan region...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} paper assesses {{the effect of}} seasonal variation on mycorrhizal fungi. Based on the richness of medicinal plants in Himalayan region, this research work considered three medicinal plants i. e. Catharanthus roseus Linn., Ocimum spp. and Asparagus racemosus Willd. The study was conducted at five districts of Uttarakhand state of India viz. Pauri Garhwal, Haridwar, Dehradun, Udham Singh Nagar and Almora. To account for seasonal variations, soil and root samples were collected in months of Jan-Feb, May-June and Sep-Oct from year 2006 to 2008. Furthermore, the study was directed to collect information about the distribution of VAM fungi in the medicinal plants in relation to spore population. This research work evaluated and analyzed the effect of temperature, altitude and seasonal conditions. The undisturbed <b>natural</b> <b>vegetations</b> revealed maximum spore numbers followed by cultivated and non-cultivated regions. Similarly, root colonization by VAM fungi was observed at higher levels in <b>natural</b> <b>vegetations</b> and cultivated sites in comparison to non-cultivated lands. The monthly and seasonal temperature varied and had considerable effect on VAM fungal population. The data obtained {{in the present study}} undoubtedly indicate that the sea-sonal variation in VAM fungi is significant with few exceptions. VAM fungi in medicinal plants differ in the manner and extent with which root colonization rate occurs and also differ in their capacity to form propagules. Most of the study reveals that host plant had much more effect on spore population. Number of spores also varied with the growing season of the host plant. During the present study most of the sites showed a general increase in spore number from Sep-Oct to Jan-Feb...|$|R
