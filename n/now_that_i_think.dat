500|$|Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Johnson {{was raised}} as the {{youngest}} of three siblings. Johnson began fighting {{at the age of}} 10, after his father's fatal heart attack. The incident made Johnson want to exert his anger physically. Johnson later said, [...] "I lost something, a huge part of me....Fighting was my way of not dealing with my dad's passing. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it, of course, it was the wrong thing to do, especially putting all that burden on my mom having to deal with it." [...] Athletic, Johnson was a three-sport varsity athlete at Marquette High School in Chesterfield, Missouri. Johnson later received a full scholarship to play football at Central Methodist University, but transferred after one year to Meramec Community College where {{he was one of the}} top NJCAA wrestlers in the country.|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE. Because liking is not enough. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{down into}} it seriously, I don't know whether I like you or not.|$|E
60|$|L. Never mind, she can't scratch {{you while}} Florrie is holding her. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it {{you had better}} pull out two.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{sometimes}} happens. For worlds I {{would not}} deceive you; and <b>I</b> <b>now</b> say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> our chance for escape {{equal to that}} of being ingulfed with the vessel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have got}} our wives here <b>now,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you'll admit is something, Bob, when you {{remember}} the pains taken by yourself to bring so great a happiness about," ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Signifies! Yes; it does signify a great deal. But, Thorne, Thorne, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{remember}} it, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can <b>think</b> of things, it was--was it not {{you yourself}} {{who told me}} that the baby did not live?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it, I have seen, in {{the reports}} of our campaigns in India, {{the name of a}} Captain Lindsay {{frequently}} mentioned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has turned}} us off; and I've sich an opinion of him <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> if he'd tak me on again to-morrow I wouldn't work for him." ...|$|E
60|$|MAGGIE. Mr. Venables, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it, surely John {{wrote to}} me that you were {{dissatisfied}} with his first speech, and that he was writing another.|$|E
6000|$|Julius {{laughed a}} little, and added, [...] "I {{am not saying}} he deserves you--hush!--or {{that it would be}} well to take him <b>now,</b> only <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> to find himself utterly {{rejected}} for so insufficient a reason, and when he was really deceived, would not only half kill him now, but do his whole nature cruel harm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank Him <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can <b>think</b> [...] Of {{those same}} future days, [...] Nor from the {{harmless}} image shrink [...] Of what I there might see-- [...] Strange babies on their mothers' knee, [...] Whose innocent soft faces might [...] From off mine eyelids strike the light, [...] With looks {{not meant for}} me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Billie met his eye {{squarely}} and steadily. [...] "Well, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> come to <b>think</b> of it, not many. In fact, very few. As {{a matter}} of fact, only...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it, I {{never told}} you, did I? Yes, your uncle made another will {{at the very}} last moment, leaving all he possessed to Miss Boyd.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} I need trouble you to answer my question, which, indeed, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it, was one I {{had no right to}} put," [...] he said as she {{recovered}} herself.|$|E
6000|$|And, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it well, I'm no nearer The riddle's {{solution}} than ever--for how's My pretty invented word, [...] "tose," [...] any clearer [...] In {{point of}} its signification than [...] "towse"? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You take {{a strange}} {{interest}} in our Pearl-Maiden, Cabbage-seller," [...] he said. [...] "And, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> come to <b>think</b> of it, {{you are a}} strange-looking man for a peasant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, John; I cannot do that; {{and perhaps}} I {{ought to say}} <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> it will ever be possible. It has all so {{surprised}} me, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> haven't known how to speak; and I am afraid I shall be letting you go from me with a false idea. Perhaps I ought to say at once that it cannot be." ...|$|R
6000|$|Barbara laughed. [...] "Pshaw!" [...] she said. [...] "You had a {{much better}} reason than <b>that.</b> <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we were {{what might be called}} good comrades in the bush?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, see ye here," [...] {{continued}} Dick, [...] "an we but escape whole we'll marry; and an we're to die, we die, and there's an end on't. But <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> how found ye my chamber?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{may well}} say, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it over, {{that it was}} this {{particular}} hen that started the mutiny. The men, well-driven by Mr. Pike, were ripe for an explosion, and Possum and the hen laid the train.|$|E
6000|$|... "And doubtless {{will end}} by falling between them. Well, you see, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it, the wounded Kaffir only {{said that they}} were ordered to take our guns and oxen, and {{incidentally}} our lives. The wagon was not mentioned." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{argument}} seems remarkably absurd. Yet {{it must be}} common, for <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> come to <b>think</b> of it, no gipsy {{will tell}} a [...] "true fortune" [...] unless her hand is crossed with silver.|$|R
60|$|Seti {{burst out}} {{laughing}} and I looked at the old priest angrily, though <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> came to <b>think</b> of it my father always said {{that his mother was}} one of the biggest liars in Egypt.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've seen {{pictures}} of Jesus," [...] said Felix meditatively. [...] "He looks just like a man, only better and kinder. But <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> come to <b>think</b> of it, I've never seen a picture of God." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can hardly}} explain. I {{can only say}} that he looked like a hawk and she like a dove--and, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it, that is what they each did look like; and do look like in their normal condition." ...|$|E
60|$|A pretty set of savages, thought he, am I taking home to America; {{people will}} think them all catamounts and Turks. Besides, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it, it's against the law. It will never do. They must be shaven and shorn--that's flat.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{who does}} manage the hospital?" [...] asked the warden. [...] "Oh, let them find that out; that's another question: {{the action is}} brought against you and Chadwick; that's your defence, and a perfect and full defence it is. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> very satisfactory." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{tell you}} frankly, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> come to <b>think</b> of it, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should prefer {{you did not}} see M. de Kercadiou with me. Your duty to your client cannot be a help to me." ...|$|R
60|$|SHE. I shouldn't {{have let}} you: <b>I</b> see <b>that</b> <b>now.</b> When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of Georgina sitting there at Teddy's feet and reading {{them to him}} for the first time, I feel I shall just go distracted.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could see}} <b>that</b> <b>now,</b> se√±or. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{it will be}} of {{advantage}} to talk, for I am sure if I were to lie with my eyes straining, and thinking of nothing else, they would soon begin to close." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good," [...] she answered, [...] "and so you {{can tell}} it to me. And <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it, you can tell me, at the same time, why you wanted to find my cousin Junius. You refused once to tell me that, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What I {{would like}} to know is if Aunt Olivia is going to be married," [...] said the Story Girl absently. [...] "I can hardly believe it. But <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it--Uncle Roger has been teasing her ever since she was in Halifax last summer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, uncle, to Gibraltar. It {{is a nice}} station, {{everyone}} says, and I am very pleased. There are so {{many places}} where there is fighting going on, <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we are most fortunate in going there. I was so afraid the regiment might be sent either to America, or India." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind <b>that</b> <b>now.</b> It {{seems so}} long ago <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can hardly <b>think</b> much about it, and I have had another visitor," [...] she added, as Mr. Clare left them to themselves, [...] "Mrs. Carleton--that poor son of hers is in such distress." ...|$|R
6000|$|His {{forgetfulness}} wounded Agatha. [...] "No {{doubt you}} are well accustomed to--" [...] She checked herself, {{and made a}} successful snatch at her normal manner with gentlemen. [...] "I scarcely remember what it was, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> begin to <b>think.</b> Some trifle, <b>I</b> suppose. Do you like orchids?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is better, if you {{can find}} a way to do it," [...] agreed Googly-Goo. [...] "Everything would come right if you could kill Gloria's love for that gardener's boy. Really, Sire, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> come to <b>think</b> of it, there must be fully a bushel and a half of those jewels!" ...|$|R
