5|$|On March 17, Brunson helped Stevenson {{qualify for}} a third {{consecutive}} appearance in the IHSA final four with a victory over Riverside Brookfield Township High School. In the game, Brunson became the Lake County career scoring record holder. On March 19, Brunson received the highest vote total for the Illinois Class 4A Associated Press All-state team. On March 20, he repeated as Illinois Gatorade Player of the Year. Brunson led Stevenson to the IHSA final four for a third consecutive time, but he led the team to the first state championship by a Lake county school with an IHSA Class 4A title-game record 30 points in a 57-40 victory over <b>Normal</b> <b>Community</b> High School. Brunson was 9-for-15 {{from the field and}} 9-for-9 from the free throw line. 2015 was Lake county's ninth consecutive year with a team reaching the IHSA final four; Stevenson became the first school in the large school division and the third school overall to win IHSA football and basketball state championships in the same year. The win got him out of the shadow of IHSA final four losses to Parker- and Okafor-led teams. Following the season, he won Illinois Mr. Basketball with 552 points and 99 of the 132 first place votes ahead of fellow Jordan Brand All-American selection Charles Matthews who had 157 points. Brunson finished his senior season with averages of 23.3 points, 5.2 assists and 4.7 rebounds per game and with shooting percentages of 38% on three point shots and 83% on free throws. At the March 30 POWERADE Jam Fest associated with the McDonald's All-American game, Brunson won the skills competition over finalists Carlton Bragg and Isaiah Briscoe and was a finalist for the three-point shooting contest. Brunson was a first-team Parade All-American, as well as a third-team USA Today All-USA high school basketball team selection. In the April 11 Nike Hoops Summit, Brunson had 12 points and 7 assists in a 103101 loss. In the April 17 Jordan Brand Classic, Brunson had a game-high 3 steals. He finished his high school career ranked #16 in the ESPN 100 and as the #2 point guard (behind Isaiah Briscoe).|$|E

Reporting to a government select committee into the operation of the reserves later the same year, Homeswest director Greg Joyce defended Quartermaine: [...] "She has done her best over a long time to run the place. One of the dilemmas we always get involved with is that when families are dysfunctional in the <b>normal</b> <b>community,</b> the tendency is for the system to ask Mrs Quartermaine to take them."

60|$|Essentially {{this type}} of {{association}} presents a localised community, a community of which the greater proportion of the individuals are engaged more or less directly in the cultivation of the land. With this there is also associated the grazing or herding over wider or more restricted areas, belonging either collectively or discretely to the community, of sheep, cattle, goats, or swine, and almost always the domestic fowl is commensal with man in this life. The cultivated land at least is usually assigned, temporarily or inalienably, as property to specific individuals, and the individuals are grouped in generally monogamic families of which the father is the head. Essentially the social unit is the Family, and even where, as in Mohammedan countries, there is no legal or customary restriction upon polygamy, monogamy still prevails as the ordinary way of living. Unmarried women are not esteemed, and children are desired. According to the dangers or securities of the region, {{the nature of the}} cultivation and the temperament of the people, this community is scattered either widely in separate steadings or drawn together into villages. At one extreme, over large areas of thin pasture this agricultural community may verge on the nomadic; at another, in proximity to consuming markets, it may present the concentration of intensive culture. There may be an adjacent Wild supplying wood, and perhaps controlled by a simple forestry. The law that holds this community together is largely traditional and customary and almost always as its primordial bond there is some sort of temple and some sort of priest. Typically, the temple is devoted to a local god or a localised saint, and its position indicates the central point of the locality, its assembly place and its market. Associated with the agriculture there are usually a few imperfectly specialised tradesmen, a smith, a garment-maker perhaps, a basket-maker or potter, who group about the church or temple. The community may maintain itself in a state of complete isolation, but more usually there are tracks or roads to the centres of adjacent communities, and a certain drift of travel, a certain trade in non-essential things. In the fundamentals of life this <b>normal</b> <b>community</b> is independent and self-subsisting, and where it is not beginning to be modified by the novel forces of the new times it produces its own food and drink, its own clothing, and largely intermarries within its limits.|$|E

By introducing the rational random selection, our method reveals the hidden deterministic and <b>normal</b> diverse <b>community</b> states of community structure. To demonstrate this method, we test it with real-world systems. The results show that our method could not only detect community structure with high sensitivity and reliability, but also provide instructional information about the hidden deterministic community world and our <b>normal</b> diverse <b>community</b> world by giving out the core-community, the real-community, the tide and the diversity.

In this research, the prevalence of major psychiatric disorders including mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders in HIV-infected patients of Rafsanjan and Kerman health care centers were determined. Materials and Methods: Eighty three HIV-infected patients were interviewed by a psychiatrist in above-mentioned health centers and their information was registered through a standard CIDI questionnaire (version 2. 1) and was statistically analyzed. Results: In this study, Out of 83 participants, 71 cases (85. 5 %) were males and 12 (14. 5 %) were females. Their age range was from 21 to 62 years old. Sixty-nine cases (83. 1 %) were diagnosed {{with at least one}} major psychiatric disorder and 14 cases (16. 9 %) with none. Among the HIV-infected patients, 54 cases (65. 1 %) suffered from a mood disorder, 21 (25. 3 %) had psychotic and 41 (49. 4 %) had anxiety disorders. Conclusion: The current study showed that major psychiatric disorders were more common in HIV-infected patients in comparison to <b>normal</b> <b>communities,</b> so on-time diagnosis and therapy and proper management of these problems could be truly a promising step in globa...|$|R
40|$|Linked or {{networked}} {{data are}} ubiquitous in many applications. Examples include web data or hypertext documents connected via hyperlinks, social networks or user profiles connected via friend links, co-authorship and citation information, blog data, movie reviews and so on. In these datasets (called “information networks”), closely related objects that {{share the same}} properties or interests form a community. For example, a community in blogsphere could be users mostly interested in cell phone reviews and news. Outlier detection in information networks can reveal important anomalous and interesting behaviors that are not obvious if community information is ignored. An example could be a low-income person being friends with many rich people even though his income is not anomalously low when considered over the entire population. This paper first introduces the concept of community outliers (interesting points or rising stars for a more positive sense), and then shows that wellknown baseline approaches without considering links or community information cannot find these community outliers. We propose an efficient solution by modeling networked data as a mixture model composed of multiple <b>normal</b> <b>communities</b> {{and a set of}} randomly generated outliers. The probabilistic model characterizes both data and links simultaneously by defining their joint distribution based on hidden Markov random fields (HMRF). Maximizing the data likelihood and the posterior of the model gives the solution to the outlier inference problem. We apply the model on bot...|$|R
