40|$|Fresh {{blueberries}} {{are very}} susceptible to mechanical damage, which limits postharvest life and firmness. Softening and susceptibility of cultivars 'Duke' and 'Brigitta' to developing internal browning (IB) after mechanical impact and subsequent storage was evaluated during a 2 -year study (2011 / 2012, 2012 / 2013). On each season fruit were carefully hand-picked, segregated into soft (< 1. 60 N), medium (1. 61 - 1. 80 N), and firm (1. 81 - 2. 00 N) categories, and then either were dropped (32 cm) onto a hard plastic surface or remained <b>non-dropped.</b> All fruit were kept under refrigerated storage (0 ºC and 85 - 88 % relative humidity) to assess firmness loss and IB after 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days. In general, regardless of cultivar or season, high variability in fruit firmness was observed within each commercial harvest, and {{significant differences in}} IB and softening rates were found. 'Duke' exhibited high softening rates, as well as high and significant r 2 between firmness and IB, but little differences for dropped vs. <b>non-dropped</b> fruit. 'Brigitta,' having lesser firmness rates, exhibited almost no relationships between firmness and IB (especially for <b>non-dropped</b> fruit), but marked differences between dropping treatments. Firmness loss and IB development were related to firmness at harvest, soft and firm fruit being the most and least damaged, respectively. Soft fruit were characterized by greater IB development during storage along with high soluble solids/acid ratio, {{which could be used}} together with firmness to estimate harvest date and storage potential of fruit. Results of this work suggest that the differences in fruit quality traits at harvest could be related to the time that fruit stay on the plant after turning blue, soft fruit being more advanced in maturity. Finally, the observed differences between segregated categories reinforce the importance of analyzing fruit condition for each sorted group separately.

5000|$|One {{nomenclature}} {{for describing}} certain classes of voicings is the [...] "drop-n" [...] terminology, such as [...] "drop-2 voicings", [...] "drop-2-and-4 voicings", etc. (sometimes spelled without hyphens). This systems views voicings as being built {{from the top}} down (probably from horn-section arranging where the melody is a given). The implicit, <b>non-dropped,</b> default voicing in this system is where all voices are in the same octave, with the individual voices being numbered {{from the top down}}. The highest voice is the first voice or voice 1. The second-highest voice is voice 2, etc. There is no provision in this nomenclature for having more than one voice on the same pitch.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I present {{a simple and}} {{efficient}} queue management (EQM) technique based on optimal bandwidth allocation for networks. Each router calculates the bandwidth share (throughput) (1) of each interfering flow at a link using link capacity and Interface IP Address (see RFC 3630) or round trip time (RTT) and congestion window size of the flows which are carried in the packets. The sources send packets and the routers in the path drop or allow the packets based on a certain probability and label the <b>non-dropped</b> packets with the allowable optimal throughput for the next round. Each router in the path modifies this label and the sources eventually adjust their sending rates based on the allowable throughput they get from the returning ACKs. In this way EQM finds the fair bandwidth allocation and gives fair queue management. I also a prove that EQM can converge to a stable point...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} 10 - 15 years, the {{epidemiological}} research literature on juvenile delinquency {{has suggested that}} there is an over-representation of males and Hispanics within the juvenile justice system, and a disproportionate number of youths having an IDEA disability, including emotional disability, learning disability, and mental retardation. In addition, juvenile delinquents tend to perform lower academically than their peers, come from low socioeconomic status backgrounds, drop out of school more often, and frequently come into contact with law enforcement agencies. Moreover, low academic achievement, male gender, and drop out contribute to the increased chances that adolescents will become involved in delinquent activities. Characteristics of juvenile delinquents also tend to be stable over time and resistant to most types of intervention. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to examine whether there were significantly greater percentages of school drop out in adjudicated versus non-adjudicated delinquent high school youths with and without an IDEA disability diagnosis. Significant differences between standardized test scores of those adjudicated and non-adjudicated youths who dropped out versus remained in school were also examined. Other variables studied in conjunction with these included gender, minority, and free/reduced lunch status. Chi-Square Tests of Independence revealed a significant association between adjudication and drop out, regardless of disability, gender, minority, or free/reduced lunch status. Chi-Square results also showed a significant association between adjudication and disability, but for <b>non-drop</b> out delinquent youths only. Drop out and disability was found to be significantly associated for males only. Univariate Analyses of Variance revealed significant differences in AIMS Reading standard scores between delinquents who had, versus had not, been identified as having a disability. Significant differences in reading scores were also found between those identified, versus not identified as SLD. Furthermore, an interaction effect between disability and minority status was present. Similar differences were found with respect to AIMS Math scores. Limitations and implications of findings as well as future research directions were discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Traffic {{engineering}} {{tools are applied}} to design a set of paths, e. g., using MPLS, in the network {{in order to achieve}} global network utilization. Usually, paths are guaranteed long-term traffic rates, while the short-term rates of bursty traffic are not guaranteed. The resource allocation scheme, suggested in this paper, handles bursts based on maximal traffic volume allocation (termed TVAfB) instead of a single maximal or sustained rate allocation. This translates to better SLAs to the network customers, namely SLAs with higher traffic peaks, that guarantees burst <b>non-dropping.</b> Given a set of paths and bandwidth allocation along them, the suggested algorithm finds a special collection of bottleneck links, which we term the first cut, as the optimal buffering location for bursts. In these locations, the buffers act as an additional resource to improve the network short-term behavior, allowing traffic {{to take advantage of the}} under-used resources at the links that precede and follow the bottleneck links. The algorithm was implemented in MATLAB. The resulted provisioning parameters were simulated using NS- 2 to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. ...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} for the motion of neutrally buoyant drops of non-Newtonian fluid through a wavy wall tube within a Newtonian suspending fluid. The motion of these drops exhibits very different behavior with respect to both Newtonian drop-Newtonian suspending fluid system and Newtonian drop-viscoelastic suspending fluid system. In particular, drop breakup behavior is strongly modified. At small flow rates (small capillary numbers) viscoelastic drops undergo drop breakup. At large flow rates (large capillary numbers) breakup phenomena do not occur and axial drop elongation is inhibited. For the cases in which drop breakup occurs, it produces important effects on the time-dependent response of the extra pressure drop and on the drop mobility. For high polymer concentration (1 %) in the viscoelastic drop, the resulting elastic effects are overshadowed by the increase in viscosity which accompanies the addition of polymer. The effects of flow type on {{the dynamics of the}} drop motion in a wavy wall tube are investigated. According {{to the nature of the}} driving mechanism there are two types of flow, each one of them presenting different properties (though identical for <b>non-drop</b> conditions). One flow is susceptible to changes in flow resistance that may appear in the experimental setup, the other is such that the volumetric flow rate is constant. The former is generated by imposing a constant pressure gradient (CPG conditions), the latter is generated by a gear pump (CFR conditions). Drop deformation in a CPG experiment is less severe than it is in a CFR experiment. Also, under CPG conditions, the axial elongation and the mobility of a moving drop are independent of the viscosity ratio, whereas under CFR conditions they depend on it. In addition, the magnitude of the extra pressure drop caused by the passage of the drop through the test section is smaller under CPG conditions than it is under CFR conditions. Finally, a more realistic simulation of flow dynamics in porous media is considered. For this purpose, a parallel channel device was tested under constant pressure gradient conditions. Measurements were taken in both arms of this device for the extra pressure drop caused by the passage of drops through one of the channels (a wavy wall tube). The ratio of the mean value of such measurements is nearly constant regardless of the value of the total volumetric flow, drop size or viscosity ratio. Obviously, the pressure drop measured in the bypass tube is a tangible indication of the increase (or decrease) in the volumetric flow through it, due to the motion of the drop through the other arm of the experimental apparatus...|$|E
