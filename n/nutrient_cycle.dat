In March 2013, data reported by researchers in October 2012, was published. It was suggested that bacteria thrive in the Mariana Trench, which with a depth of up to 11 kilometres is the deepest known part of the oceans. Other researchers reported related studies that microbes thrive inside rocks up to 580 metres below the sea floor under 2.6 kilometres of ocean off the coast of the northwestern United States.

40|$|Given the {{principles}} of organic agriculture, nutrient cycling in Dutch organic farming can be characterised as imperfect, mainly because of large imports of nutrients from conventional agriculture and from abroad. Recently, research has been initiated into the perspectives for better closing <b>nutrient</b> <b>cycles</b> by intensifying the exchange of (by-) products between organic farming sectors. The linear programming model was developed to quantify under different scenarios the agronomic consequences of further closing <b>nutrient</b> <b>cycles</b> in terms of changes in land use and exchange of (by-) products. Better closing of <b>nutrient</b> <b>cycles</b> requires {{an increase in the}} proportion of Dutch feed ingredients in animal diets, an increase in the proportion of feed and leguminous crops in rotations, an increase in the export of manure from the organic dairy sector and an increase of the import of `acceptable¿ nutrients from society. Depending on the sector and the degree in which `undesirable¿ nutrient imports are banned, current sizes of the main farming sectors will have to change to be in equilibrium, i. e. a situation in which total organic manure production determines organic crop areas and crop productivity per ha and vice versa.
