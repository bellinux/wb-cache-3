5|$|In 2003 Trump {{tried to}} move the Sybase Classic, a LPGA tournament, from Wykagyl Country Club to Trump's club for 2007; the Wykagyl lease would run out in that year. Briarcliff Manor's mayor Peter Chatsky was opposed to the plan; Trump {{attempted}} to persuade the mayor {{to talk to his}} wife, Jean Chatzky, about the financial benefit of hosting the tournament, adding that village residents would be hired for the event. A Trump Organization vice president suggested donating some proceeds to the Briarcliff Manor Public Library's then-proposed expansion or toward improving a village baseball field. The club's special-use permit with the village restricted the course to 300 people and banned large-scale tournaments from taking place there. The discussion between the Trump Organization and village government stopped that year, however in 2004, Trump submitted a <b>new</b> <b>request</b> to bring a LPGA or PGA tournament to the club.|$|E
5|$|San Martín made a <b>new</b> <b>request</b> for {{ships to}} Bowles, but {{received}} no answer. He moved again to Buenos Aires, {{to make a}} similar request. He arrived to Mendoza {{a few days after}} the execution of the Chileans Luis and Juan José Carrera, brothers of José Miguel Carrera. The specific initiative of those executions is controversial. Chilean historian Vicuña Mackenna indicts San Martín, while J. C. Raffo de la Reta blames O'Higgins instead. Manuel Rodríguez was also imprisoned and then killed in prison; this death may have been decided by the Lautaro lodge. San Martín could not have taken part in it, as he was already on the way to Buenos Aires.|$|E

Thinking that the federal authorities did not react quickly enough, Onis addressed the Maryland state authorities, getting a Justice of the Peace to arrest Almeida on charges of piracy.|$|E
40|$|M {{hotel rooms}} are {{available}} at a date n periods from now. Reservations are made by customers for that date, {{which is at the}} peak of the high season. Typically, for such a time period, a policy of overbooking is exercised by the hotel management. Customers, however, may cancel their previously confirmed reservations at any time prior to their arrival, with no penalty. On the other hand, <b>new</b> <b>requests</b> for rooms for that particular date are generated anew. At the end of each period the hotel management reviews both the "inventory" level of remaining uncanceled (previously confirmed) reservations and the total number of not-yet-confirmed <b>new</b> <b>requests.</b> At that time a decision is made regarding the inventory level of confirmed reservations with which to start the next period. A decision is one of three actions: (i) to keep the inventory at its present level (i. e., declining all new requests); (ii) to increase the level of overbooking by confirming some of the <b>new</b> <b>requests</b> and, if necessary, by trying to obtain some additional reservations (at some extra cost); (iii) to decrease the level of inventory by canceling some of the previously confirmed reservations (incurring a penalty for each such cancellation). Each occupied room at the target day carries a given profit, while each unhonored reservation at that time incurs a penalty. The problem is to find the optimal over-booking strategy that will maximize net profit. For both criteria, maximization of the expected total net profit, and maximization of the expected discounted net profit, it is shown that the optimal strategy is a 3 -region policy as follows: For each period there exist upper and lower bounds and an intermediate point such that, (a) if the overbooking level at the end of a period is greater than the upper bound, it should be decreased to that bound; (b) if the inventory level is below the lower bound, two cases may occur: (i) if the discrepancy is greater than the number of <b>new</b> <b>requests,</b> all <b>new</b> <b>requests</b> should be confirmed and additional reservations should be acquired such that the inventory level will be equal to the lower bound; and (ii) if the discrepancy is smaller than the number of <b>new</b> <b>requests,</b> some of the <b>new</b> <b>requests</b> are confirmed but the inventory level may not exceed the intermediate point; (c) if the inventory level is between the two bounds there are two possibilities: (i) if it is above the intermediate point none of the <b>new</b> <b>requests</b> are confirmed, but (ii) if it is below that point, some of the <b>new</b> <b>requests</b> should be confirmed provided that the new inventory level will not exceed the intermediate point. ...|$|R

25|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the Second World War, the Jewish Agency led by Chaim Weizmann submitted to the Allies a memorandum demanding reparations to Jews by Germany but it received no answer. In March 1951, a <b>new</b> <b>request</b> was made by Israel's foreign minister Moshe Sharett which claimed global recompense to Israel of $1.5billion based on the financial cost absorbed by Israel for the rehabilitation of 500,000 Jewish survivors. West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer accepted these terms and declared he was ready to negotiate other reparations. A Conference on Jewish Material Claims against Germany was opened in New York City by Nahum Goldmann in order to help with individual claims. After negotiations, the claim was reduced to a sum of $845millions direct and indirect compensations to be installed in a period of 14 years. In 1988, West Germany allocated another $125million for reparations.|$|E
25|$|FOA's Torsten Magnusson {{met with}} the American envoy Howard A. Robinson in November 1954, and Malte Jacobsson from the Atom Committee talked to Counter Admiral Lewis Strauss from Atomic Energy Commission in April 1955. Sweden {{indicated}} {{that it would be}} interested in purchasing approximately 25 nuclear devices. In 1957, Ambassador Erik Boheman raised the question at the US State Department, while the Swedish Ministry of Defense inquired about sending Swedish officers to train on the use of nuclear weapons. Boheman also mentioned that Denmark and Norway had already purchased weapons systems that could carry nuclear warheads, although neither country had devices to deploy on such systems. The American response was dismissive because Sweden, as a non-NATO state, did not have any mutual defense agreement with the US, which was a requirement in American law to even consider nuclear weapons cooperation. The message was clear - if Sweden reconsidered its nonalignment policy, the US would consider a <b>new</b> <b>request</b> from Sweden, otherwise discussions would be fruitless. Analysis from the US State Department in 1959, showed that Sweden {{did not have to be}} a NATO-member for the proposed nuclear weapons sales, but it had to, at the very minimum, have an agreement with the US regarding use of nuclear weapons, which would imply Sweden renouncing nonalignment. On April 6, 1960, the United States National Security Council decided that the Americans should not support the Swedish ownership of nuclear weapons, nor did it approve of the idea of a Swedish nuclear weapons program. The US Government believed that Western interests would be best served against the Soviet Union if Sweden invested its limited resources in conventional weapons, rather than an expensive nuclear weapons program.|$|E
