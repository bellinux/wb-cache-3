Differences among treatments were evaluated by means of statistical analyses (ANOVA, principal components and discriminant analyses). All formulations diminished PPO activity during storage successfully. The melanosis score was higher in sulphite-treated Norway lobsters, and a formulation with 0. 05 % 4 -hexylresorcinol was enough to prevent the appearance of melanosis for 12 days.

Results indicate that the process of visual selection into one of four possible vigour categories reflects with good accuracy the underlying physiological state ofthe animals, as assessed by the level of adenylate 5 –triphosphate in the tailmuscles, by the proportions of other nucleotides as expressed in the Adenylate Energy Charge, and by the amount of intra-muscular l-lactate present.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Organisms {{in natural}} {{habitats}} must frequently respond {{to changes in}} their environments through various physiological mechanisms. My laboratory has developed several methods for the quantifi-cation of stress in crustaceans. An ELISA was developed for the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) from the American lobster (Homarus americanus). It is sensitive to as little as 0. 2 fmol of peptide. Increases in hemolymph CHH were observed under conditions of acute hypoxia, elevated temperature, and altered salinity. In addition, elevated CHH concentrations were observed in <b>Norway</b> <b>lobsters</b> (<b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus)</b> that were parasitized with the dinoflagellate Hematodinium sp. Stress proteins, also known as heat-shock proteins (HSPs), comprise a highly conserved class of proteins that display elevated transcription during periods of stress. Using homologous molecular probes, my collab-orators and I have examined the influence of heat-shock, osmotic stress, and the molt cycle upon HSP expression at the protein and mRNA levels. We observed a significant elevation in HSP mRNA expression after 1 hr of heat-shock or after 0. 5 hr of osmotic stress. When comparing claw and abdominal muscles during molting, we observed a tissue-specific HSP response. Quantification of these different stress responses may serve as early indicators of the degradation of environmental health...|$|E
40|$|Dinoflagellates of the genusHematodinium infect over 40 {{species of}} marine crustaceans. Since the initial {{description}} of this parasite in France in the 1930 s [1], {{it appears to}} have spread glob-ally, causing economic loss in some species, including Tanner crabs (Chionoecetes bairdi) in Alaska [2], blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) in the United States [3], edible crabs (Cancer pagurus) and <b>Norway</b> <b>lobsters</b> (<b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus)</b> in Europe [4 – 7], sand crabs (Portunus armatus) in Australia [8], and Chinese swimming crabs (Portunus trituberculatus) in northern China [9]. Because this disease is thought to be fatal, it may be of great significance to the sus-tainability of both captive shellfish fisheries and aquaculture [10, 11]. For instance, the decline in blue crabs from the Atlantic to Gulf Coasts in the US appears to be linked to epizootic out-breaks of disease caused byHematodinium [12]. Similarly, the reduction in velvet swimmer crab (Necora puber) numbers in Brittany in the 1980 s has been attributed to the high preva-lence of such infections [13]. Finally, the recent reports ofHematodinium infections in crabs and shrimp raised under aquaculture conditions in China [9, 14, 15] highlight the danger to ad-ditional, cultured crustacean populations.

40|$|<b>Norway</b> <b>lobsters,</b> <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus,</b> are sediment-dwelling decapod {{crustaceans}} that excavate burrows {{from which}} they make short excursions to feed by predation and scavenging. The females of this species are known to reside within their burrows {{for an extended period}} of time over the winter while brooding their eggs. The aim of this study was to assess the likelihood of these females being able to feed during this brooding period. Biophysical and biochemical measurements that had previously been shown to change with starvation under laboratory conditions in male N. norvegicus were taken for female N. norvegicus under similar conditions. These measurements were also compared in both sexes obtained from monthly trawl samples from the Clyde Sea Area, Scotland, UK, together with trawl composition data. The laboratory study showed that the hepatosomatic index, and the copper, lipid and water content of the hepatopancreas can be used as indicators of the state of starvation in females, as in males. In the wild, both sexes have reduced nutritional status during the winter, but not to the degree seen in animals starved for 20 weeks in aquarium trials. This study does not support the hypothesis that females cease feeding over winter, during their brooding period. Firstly, some females were unable to sustain ovary development during starvation under controlled conditions, contrary to field observations.

40|$|Hematodinium and Hematodinium-like {{species have}} emerged in the last 3 decades as {{important}} parasitic pathogens of crustaceans worldwide, causing a significant economic loss to fisheries and related markets. In some species (notably the Tanner crab Chionoecetes bairdi), the parasite reportedly causes the cooked meat to taste bitter and aspirin-like. The bitter taste, together with the gross pathology of the infection, renders these crabs unmarketable. Surprisingly, no organoleptic tests have ever been conducted to date, and the cause for the bitter taste is still unknown. Nevertheless, it is generally assumed that the bitter taste occurs widely in cooked meats and products derived from crustaceans infected with Hematodinium. In the present study, we analysed the meat quality and organoleptic attributes after capture and during storage of <b>Norway</b> <b>lobsters</b> <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus</b> from Scottish waters that were either asymptomatic or symptomatic of patent Hematodinium infection. Results from the sensory evaluation of the cooked product indicate that tail meat from symptomatic N. norvegicus is bland in flavour and aftertaste, and more friable or sloppier in texture than meat from asymptomatic animals. As a consequence, infected meat tends to be less palatable, although surprisingly no bitter taste is reported. From an analytical point of view, tail meat from patently infected animals is at an advanced stage of auto - lysis, while no difference in microbial load is detected. These results suggest that Norway lobsters heavily infected with Hematodinium are of inferior marketing quality even after the tails have been cooked...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – The {{necessity}} {{to move from}} a traditional fishery management to an ecosystem approach is now acknowl-edged. Indicators are required to support {{the development of this}} approach. For example, community indicators have been proposed {{to assess the impact of}} fishing. We tested here the applicability of one such community indicator, the abundance-biomass comparison (ABC method), as a measure of the impact of bottom trawling (years of sampling: 2001 and 2003) on the benthic invertebrates – typically starfishes, crabs, squat lobsters, shrimps and large hard-shelled molluscs- of “Grande Vasière”, a major French fishing zone, in the Bay of Biscay. The ABC method is generally used as an impact indicator for different types of physical, biological and anthropogenic disturbances on benthic communities. This method is based on the assumption that increasing disturbance shifts communities from dominance by large-bodied species with low turnover rates toward dominance by small-bodied species with high turnover rates. At less disturbed areas the average biomass of individuals is greater than at more heavily disturbed areas. The ABC method measures this effect by comparing the ranked distributions of abundance and biomass within a given community. We applied the ABC method and compared the size structure and the species diversity at two areas exposed to moderate and high bottom trawl effort. Species diversity was lower in the most exploited area. The highly trawled area was dominated by opportunistic organisms, mainly one species of swimming crab Liocarcinus depurator, one species of squat lobster Munida rugosa and <b>Norway</b> <b>lobsters</b> <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus,</b> which are large-bodied species.

From spring to autumn, {{this is the}} coldest water mass in the Mediterranean basin. Climatologically, it has a temperature of 11. 62 ?C, salinity of 38. 47, density anomaly > 29. 2 kg m- 3. In late winter - early spring, a denser water mass (the Northern Adriatic Dense Water - NAdDW), which forms in winter in the Northern Adriatic shelf, arrives in the Pomo Pits and renews the resident bottom waters. The Pomo Pits area is important for climatic studies, being a test site where significant fluctuations of the dense water formed in the Northern Adriatic are "memorised".

40|$|The {{recovery}} {{potential of}} <b>Norway</b> <b>lobsters</b> (<b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus)</b> held in on-board seawater tanks after trawl-capture was assessed at two {{different times of}} the year (winter and summer). Survival recorded 24 h after trawl-capture was 84. 83 ± 0. 93 % in the winter compared to 75. 35 ± 2. 92 % in the summer. Stress-related parameters in the muscle (arginine phosphate, glycogen and L-lactate) and in the haemolymph (L-lactate) were measured, together with nucleotide breakdown products in the muscle (yielding the “Adenylate Energy Charge” or AEC ratio). All parameters analysed were responsive to the stress of the trawl-capture and subsequently recovered towards resting values, but did so at different rates. The fact that some measures recovered at a faster rate than others should be taken into account when trying to develop an index of metabolic stress for this species. Animals trawled in the winter recovered to AEC values above 0. 8 within 4 h of placing them in on-board seawater tanks, whereas animals trawled in the summer took 24 h to reach these values. Furthermore, {{at the end of the}} trials animals trawled in the summer presented significantly higher haemolymph L-lactate and lower muscle glycogen reserves than the animals trawled in the winter, suggesting a faster recovery in the winter compared to the summer. Finally, animals in the winter were better able to endure further stresses (an emersion of 1 h while animals were transported to the commercial handling facilities). Therefore, as a code of practice it is advised that trawled N. norvegicus directed to the live trade should be allowed to recover for at least 4 – 6 h in on-board tanks, and extra care should be taken especially in the summer, if further stresses such as additional emersion are to be applied within the first 24 h after capture...|$|E

The majority of the Norwegian monitoring and research on the lobsters and Norway lobster are the IMR. Besides the IMR, the Norwegian Research Council supports on average 3 to 5 projects per year. This is mainly applied studies, directed to develop aquaculture as well as monitoring the reestablishment of lobster stocks and stock indexes. Monitoring of the fisheries {{is the responsibility of}} the IMR and is based on fisheries data (log books, landing weight and value, catch per unit effort (CPUE) and survey data. CPUE from selected fishermen has been monitored for lobsters in the Skagerrak for nearly a century. Due to illegal fishery the registered landings are not resentative for the total landings for these species. About 4 man year (5 500 h/year) are invested in the North Sea. The effort is split between the shrimp survey and various lobster studies. The lobster studies are partly monitoring of the lobster fishery in general, lobster migration and the lobster fishery in and around the MPAs, and ecological and rearing studies in sea ranching-related studies. Norway lobsters are not monitored except for as bycatch in shrimp surveys. This presentation will be a review of the ongoing activities and a short summary over results from previous projects.

Landings in terms of biomass, income and catch composition were compared under commercial conditions. Four métiers were identified in the fishery: European hake (Merluccius merluccius), red mullet (Mullus barbatus), red shrimp (Aristeus antennatus) and <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster</b> (<b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus).</b> No significant differences were observed in biomass or income owing to the new mesh in either European hake or red mullet.
