25|$|Cucumeropsis mannii is {{a member}} of the Cucurbitaceae family. Vernacular names for this crop include egusi-itoo and white seed melon. This crop is often {{referred}} to as “the real egusi” given its long history in West Africa, dating back 4,000 years. This crop is primarily harvested for its large white seeds called egusi-itoo. The seeds are commonly processed into soups and oil products, and are also eaten individually as a snack. Benefits of Cucumeropsis mannii crops are many. The crop thrives in harsh climates and high yields are attainable in barren landscapes. Pests and disease are rarely a problem for farmers of this crop. Further benefits include increased soil quality through ground cover and suppression of weeds. This crop also holds significant nutritional value. Oil makes up 44% of the seed, where 30% is protein rich in essential amino acids. The seed is an excellent vegetable protein, and is ideal for battling nutritional debilitations. High in essential vitamins and minerals, egusi-itoo compliments the starch and grain diet of most Africans. Despite the crops obvious advantages, Cucumeropsis mannii remains an underutilized tool for <b>nutritional</b> <b>intervention</b> in Africa.|$|E

40|$|Objective Including {{developing}} countries, between 20 and 88 % of gynecological oncology {{patients may}} present {{with at least}} mild malnutrition at diagnosis. Significant morbidity and mortality is attributed to malnutrition. Here we reviewed randomized clinical trials of <b>nutritional</b> <b>interventions</b> used to achieve early return to oral diet, enhance recovery from surgery and reduce adverse events in gynecological cancer patients undergoing surgery. Methods Ebscohost (CINAHL + Medline + PsycINFO), Cochrane, Embase, PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for articles published from 2000 onwards. Potentially eligible articles were screened by two reviewers. Length of hospital stay (LOS), postoperative complications, recovery of intestinal function, quality of life (QOL), hematological and immunological parameters were outcome measures of the <b>nutritional</b> <b>interventions.</b> Results Seven randomized clinical trials {{were included in the}} review. Early clear liquid diet, semiliquid diet, regular diet or immune-enhanced enteral diets were all found to be safe as <b>nutritional</b> <b>interventions.</b> In five of the seven trials significantly better outcomes were observed in the intervention group compared to usual care for one of more of the outcomes intestinal recovery time, LOS, postoperative complications and immunological parameters. However, the <b>nutritional</b> <b>interventions</b> varied greatly between the trials, making it difficult to directly compare their findings. Trial quality was low to moderate. Recommended malnutrition screening and assessment tools and guidelines for treatment are reviewed. Conclusions From the limited findings it would appear that <b>nutritional</b> <b>interventions</b> of early oral feeding and enteral feeding are safe. Receiving <b>nutritional</b> <b>interventions</b> seems to reduce LOS, intestinal recovery time and postoperative complications for some patients.

40|$|Abstract Sleep has {{numerous}} important {{physiological and}} cognitive functions {{that may be}} particularly important to elite athletes. Recent evidence, as well as anecdotal information, suggests that athletes may experience a reduced quality and/or quantity of sleep. Sleep deprivation can have significant effects on athletic performance, espe-cially submaximal, prolonged exercise. Compromised sleep may also influence learning, memory, cognition, pain per-ception, immunity and inflammation. Furthermore, changes in glucose metabolism and neuroendocrine function {{as a result of}} chronic, partial sleep deprivation may result in alterations in carbohydrate metabolism, appetite, food intake and protein synthesis. These factors can ultimately have a negative influence on an athlete’s nutritional, met-abolic and endocrine status and hence potentially reduce athletic performance. Research has identified a number of neurotransmitters associated with the sleep–wake cycle. These include serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid, orexin, melanin-concentrating hormone, cholinergic, galanin, nor-adrenaline, and histamine. Therefore, nutritional interven-tions that may act on these neurotransmitters in the brain may also influence sleep. Carbohydrate, tryptophan, vale-rian, melatonin and other <b>nutritional</b> <b>interventions</b> have been investigated as possible sleep inducers and represent promising potential interventions. In this review, the factors influencing sleep quality and quantity in athletic popula-tions are examined and the potential impact of <b>nutritional</b> <b>interventions</b> is considered. While there is some research investigating the effects of <b>nutritional</b> <b>interventions</b> on sleep, future research may highlight the importance of <b>nutritional</b> and dietary <b>interventions</b> to enhance sleep. ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review {{addresses}} {{the relationship between}} <b>nutritional</b> <b>intervention</b> {{and quality of life}} in oncology patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Nutrition related symptoms, such as anorexia and weight loss, reflect impaired nutritional status, which is often associated with reduced quality of life. Malnutrition can be related to reduced response or tolerance to cancer treatment. Early <b>nutritional</b> <b>intervention</b> may positively impact on quality of life and enhance clinical response in oncology patients. SUMMARY: <b>Nutritional</b> <b>intervention</b> should be considered as a supportive measure within the global oncology strategy. In curative oncology care, it contributes to reduced postoperative infection rate, better control of cancer-related symptoms, shortened length of hospital stay and improved tolerance to treatment. In palliative care, the <b>nutritional</b> <b>intervention</b> focuses on controlling symptoms, thus improving quality of life. The evaluation of nutritional status should include an assessment of quality of life in order to optimize nutritional treatment for patients' individual requirements. Because of the potentially clinically relevant impact of <b>nutritional</b> <b>intervention</b> on quality of life, nutritional care should be included in any antineoplastic strategy. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{worldwide}} ageing {{demographic trend}} {{has resulted in}} a growing number of frail elderly who are in the last stages of autonomous living. Oral <b>nutritional</b> <b>interventions</b> for the frail elderly address the body’s natural weight loss, sometimes reversing weight loss, though the literature is not of one accord. No review of <b>nutritional</b> <b>interventions</b> has been conducted for community-dwelling frail elderly, {{who are most likely to}} benefit from these interventions and delay adverse outcomes. Objective: (i) This systematic review analyzes results from randomized controlled trials of oral nutrition interventions for the community-dwelling frail elderly to determine their efficacy in making gains in nutritional and functional status. (ii) The secondary objective is to analyze the quality of the studies in this review and draw conclusions for further areas of development in the field of nutrition in elderly care. Methods: Randomized controlled trials of oral nutritional supplements were searched in The Cochrane Library and PubMed, and hand searched in reference lists of systematic reviews. These interventions targeted protein-energy deficiency and included oral supplementation or supplementation paired with exercise compared to a placebo or usual practice. Community-dwelling frail elderly not institutionalized or hospitalized were eligible. Studies targeting disease-specific elderly were excluded. Results: Out of 120 search results, six trials were included in this review. A small weight gain from oral <b>nutritional</b> <b>interventions</b> among frail community-dwelling elderly was reported in five out of six studies. Functional status did not improve significantly with the interventions. Studies used unstandardized definitions and different ways to measure outcomes, resulting in heterogeneity.
