We demonstrate that neurogenic differentiation 1 (NeuroD 1) is a regulatory hub securing cross talk among survival and migratory-inducing signaling pathways in neuroendocrine lung carcinomas. We find that NeuroD 1 promotes tumor cell survival and metastasis in aggressive neuroendocrine lung tumors through regulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB). Like TrkB, the prometastatic signaling molecule neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is a downstream target of NeuroD 1, whose impaired expression mirrors loss of Neu-roD 1.

40|$|<b>Neuroendocrine</b> {{prostate}} <b>cancer</b> is {{a lethal}} variant {{of prostate cancer}} {{that is associated with}} castrate-resistant growth, metastasis, and mortality. The tumor environment of <b>neuroendocrine</b> prostate <b>cancer</b> is heterogeneous and characterized by hypoxia, necrosis, and numerous mitoses. Although acidic extracellular pH has been implicated in aggressive cancer features including metastasis and therapeutic resistance, its role in <b>neuroendocrine</b> prostate <b>cancer</b> physiology and metabolism has not yet been explored. We used the well-characterized PNEC cell line as a model to establish the effects of extracellular pH (pH 6. 5, 7. 4, and 8. 5) on <b>neuroendocrine</b> prostate <b>cancer</b> cell metabolism. We discovered that alkalinization of extracellular pH converted cellular metabolism to a nutrient consumption-dependent state that was susceptible to glucose deprivation, glutamine deprivation, and 2 -deoxyglucose (2 -DG) mediated inhibition of glycolysis. Conversely, acidic pH shifted cellular metabolism toward an oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) -dependent state that was susceptible to OXPHOS inhibition. Based upon this mechanistic knowledge of pH-dependent metabolism, we identified that the FDA-approved anti-helminthic niclosamide depolarized mitochondrial potential and depleted ATP levels in PNEC cells whose effects were enhanced in acidic pH. To further establish relevance of these findings, we tested the effects of extracellular pH on susceptibility to nutrient deprivation and OXPHOS inhibition in a cohort of castrate-resistant prostate cancer cell lines C 4 - 2 B, PC- 3, and PC- 3 M. We discovered similar pH-dependent toxicity profiles among all cell lines with these treatments. These findings underscore a potential importance to acidic extracellular pH in the modulation of cell metabolism in tumors and development of an emerging paradigm that exploits the synergy of environment and therapeutic efficacy in cancer...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE To {{investigate}} response, survival, {{and safety}} {{profile of the}} somatostatin-based radiopeptide (90) yttrium-labeled tetraazacyclododecane-tetraacetic acid modified Tyr-octreotide ([(90) Y-DOTA]-TOC) in <b>neuroendocrine</b> <b>cancers.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS In a clinical phase II single-center open-label trial, patients with <b>neuroendocrine</b> <b>cancers</b> were treated with repeated cycles of [(90) Y-DOTA]-TOC. Each cycle consisted of a single intravenous injection of 3. 7 GBq/m(2) body-surface [(90) Y-DOTA]-TOC. Additional cycles were withheld in case of tumor progression and/or permanent toxicity. Results Overall, 1, 109 patients received 2, 472 cycles of [(90) Y-DOTA]-TOC (median, two; range, one to 10 cycles per patient). Of the 1, 109 patients, 378 (34. 1 %) experienced morphologic response; 172 (15. 5 %), biochemical response; and 329 (29. 7 %), clinical response. During a median follow-up of 23 months, 491 patients (44. 3 %) died. Longer survival was correlated with each: morphologic (hazard ratio [HR], 0. 46; 95 % CI, 0. 38 to 0. 56; median survival, 44. 7 v 18. 3 months; P >. 001), biochemical (HR, 0. 75; 95 % CI, 0. 59 to 0. 96; 35. 3 v 25. 7 months; P =. 023), and clinical response (HR, 0. 68; 95 % CI, 0. 56 to 0. 82; 36. 8 v 23. 5 months; P >. 001). Overall, 142 patients (12. 8 %) developed grade 3 to 4 transient hematologic toxicities, and 103 patients (9. 2 %) experienced grade 4 to 5 permanent renal toxicity. Multivariable regression revealed that tumoral uptake in the initial imaging study was predictive for overall survival (HR, 0. 45; 95 % CI, 0. 29 to 0. 69; P >. 001), whereas the initial kidney uptake was predictive for severe renal toxicity (HR, 1. 59; 95 % CI, 1. 17 to 2. 17; P =. 003). CONCLUSION This study documents the long-term outcome of [(90) Y-DOTA]-TOC treatment in a large cohort. Response to [(90) Y-DOTA]-TOC is associated with longer survival. Somatostatin receptor imaging is predictive for both survival after [(90) Y-DOTA]-TOC treatment and occurrence of renal toxicity...|$|R
