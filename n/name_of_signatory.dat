5000|$|Mary Katherine Goddard (June 16, 1738 [...] - [...] August 12, 1816) was {{an early}} American publisher, and the {{postmaster}} of the Baltimore Post Office from 1775 to 1789. She was the second printer to print the Declaration of Independence. Her copy, the Goddard Broadside, was commissioned by Congress in 1777, {{and was the first}} to include the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> the <b>signatories.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Linguists are {{interested}} in the letter because the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> the community members are of Turkic, Slavic, and Hebrew origins (for example, names such as: [...] "Hanukkah," [...] "Yehudah," [...] "Gostata," [...] and [...] "Kiabar"). There is some disagreement as to whether these Jews were Israelites who had taken local names, or whether their names indicate Turkic or Slavic origins. The debate is complicated by the presence <b>of</b> the <b>name</b> Kiabar Kohen. According to Omeljan Pritsak, this name indicates that non-Israelite Khazars adopted the status of Kohen, possibly because they had formed a pre-conversion priestly caste. An alternative scenario is that Israelite Jews in Khazaria adopted Khazar Turkic names, much {{in the same way that}} Jews, including prominent rabbis, had adopted Aramaic, Persian, Arabic, Greek, and German names. [...] Recent studies determined that at least one <b>of</b> the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>signatories</b> is Slavic and that it is likely that the signatories with non-Jewish names, were Jews who adopted local names.|$|R

50|$|When on January 18, 1777, the Second Continental Congress moved {{that the}} Declaration of Independence be widely distributed, Goddard {{was one of}} the first to offer the use of her press. This was in spite of the risks of being {{associated}} with what was considered a treasonable document by the British. Her copy, the Goddard Broadside, was the second printed, and the first to contain the typeset <b>names</b> <b>of</b> the <b>signatories,</b> including John Hancock. During the American Revolution, Goddard opposed the Stamp Act vehemently, recognizing it would increase the cost of printing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} Hermenegild as a bishop of Oviedo probably dates to 899. In that year, Alfonso III of Asturias, who kept his capital at Oviedo, founded {{the temple of}} Santiago in a church council held at Oviedo. The acts of the council are preserved in the Tumbo Nuevo of Lugo Cathedral, and Hermenegild's name is attached to them. Their date, however, is controversial. A date of 14 June 927 that comes down to us in one copy of the acta is certainly false, as Alfonso III was long dead at the time, but the alternative date of 7 May 899 provided by another copy {{is consistent with the}} <b>names</b> <b>of</b> all <b>signatories</b> <b>of</b> the acta.|$|R

Variants of the 1620 Mayflower Compact frequently excluded the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> the forty-one <b>signatories</b> <b>of</b> that accord, yet for those instruments that furnished this list, the spellings were anything but consistent. This variance was also evident in the few references to the appellations of the Mayflower participants found in the 1621 Conference and Agreement Between Plymouth Colony and Massasoit, Wampanoag Sachem. In particular, Levenshtein edit distance analyses assessed these Compact name disparities and the texts of that manifesto, and examined the provenance of its later renditions. A strong correlation between observed pairs <b>of</b> text and <b>signatory</b> list errors was also found. We welcome your comments, as well as your error reports. The URL for this resource is [URL] Attached below, as Additional Files, are 6 tables (Excel files) presenting the data characteristics and correlation data for the Mayflower Compact text and signatories...|$|R

So {{it is with the}} prefecture, the police, the fire department, the criminal judiciary, the public prosecutor. Justices of the Peace, the sub-offices of the District Court, prosecutors, and the local Catholic diocese all consider the Mappano area as an extension of Turin. A project called “PRUSST 2010 plan” envisaged investments of around 500 million EUR, of which approximately two-thirds are private and the rest public. PRUSST was prepared by the municipality of Settimo Torinese in agreement with the municipalities of Torino, Brandizzo, and Borgaro Torinese planning a connection and completion of the Green Crown creating an inter-connected park between urban parks (in Borgaro and Turin) and regional parks (La Mandria Park and the Po River) to form a corridor. The plan for the area of BorSetTo (from the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> the <b>signatory</b> municipalities) is another similar intervention of inter-institutional cooperation and coordination. BorSetTo involves approximately 3 million square meters to be used as public park, residential areas and services (12  % of the total area), and a technology center in the Mappano area belonging to Borgaro Torinese.|$|R
