40|$|Graduation date: 1991 For {{the purpose}} of {{investigating}} the fundamental nature of the interannual oscillation observed in the tropical Pacific in conjunction with El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set was analyzed. Based upon this analysis, an "intermediate" tropical atmosphere-ocean coupled model was developed. For reason of their particular importance to atmosphere-ocean interactions, moisture processes such as condensation-convergence, evaporation-sea surface temperature and evaporation-wind feedbacks were given special emphasis in both the data analysis and modeling processes. The atmospheric component of the model {{is based on the}} first baroclinic mode, which is driven by the atmospheric internal heating. The oceanic model consists of two layers with an imbedded oceanic mixed-layer, by which SST is predicted. The present study has demonstrated that despite the structural simplicity of the oceanic model, it is capable of simulating mean oceanic circulation. In preparation for coupling, individual models were first tested with the use of appropriate time-dependent boundary conditions specified from the composite ENSO data. Both model simulations reproduced the major features associated with the ENSO events. Coupling was performed following the imposition of wind stress anomalies over the western Pacific for a given time period and the removal of all external forcing for a period of eight years thereafter. The coupled responses simulated during the the first two-year period provided reasonable simulations of the following ENSO-like features: the appearance of warm sea-surface temperature anomalies in the central Pacific, deepening/shallowing of mixed-layers in the eastern/western Pacific, weakening of the trades in the central Pacific, strengthening/weakening of the <b>North</b> <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Counter</b> Current/South <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Currents,</b> and enhanced convective activities around the dateline. The long-term coupled integration showed a pattern of interannual oscillation over a period of approximately three years. The results obtained from this coupling study have illustrated (1) that the necessary condition for the interannual oscillation is the interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean and (2) that it is likely that oceanic wave dynamics plays {{a crucial role in the}} determination of the growth and decay of ENSO events...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This {{paper offers}} a {{technical}} and geopolitical reappraisal of a macro-engineering proposal to plumb Earth’s freshwater, siphoning {{some of it}} from a region of surplus (Amazon River Basin) to a region of shortage (arid northern Africa) via his positively buoyant (subsurface floating) seabed-anchored Transatlantic Freshwa-ter Aqueduct. Two different routes for the pipeline, of length 4, 317 and 3, 745 km, respectively, have been considered. Pipe diameters larger than 60 m are necessary for “reasonable ” low pumping power (i. e., less than 20 GW). Using a bundle of smaller size pipes instead of a larger single pipe might overcome technical difficulties but the advantage of simplifying the construction technology might be exceeded by the disadvantage of consuming more power in operation. To keep the number of pumping stations reasonably small (i. e. fewer than 20) a single pipe of diameter higher than 30 m (or bundles of smaller diameter pipes) is required. The Atlantic Ocean currents {{may be used to}} provide the necessary power for pumps. The available power possibly provided by the North Brazil Current ranges between 2 and 9 GW.

For comparative analysis, data of the physico-chemical properties and chl-a were matched to the two sampling depths (surface mixed layer and thermocline depth- 200 m) of zooplankton. Latitudinal differences in the mesozooplankton distribution were mainly influenced by diver-gence formed at a boundary line formed by currents of opposing directions, consisting of North Equatorial Current (NEC) and <b>North</b> <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Counter</b> <b>Current</b> (NECC). High concentrations of chl-a south of 9 oN, caused by equatorial upwelling related nutrients, {{is thought to be}} affected by the role of this divergence bar-rier, supported by relatively low concentrations in waters north of 9 oN.

Previous studies estimate that the mean rate of wind work (or wind power) acting on the surface currents over the global ocean amounts to 1. 1 TW (1 TW 1012 Watts), though values remain highly uncertain. By analyzing the output {{from a range of}} ocean-only models and data assimilations, we show that the tropical Pacific Ocean contributes around 0. 2 to 0. 4 TW, which is roughly half of the total tropical contribution. Not only does this wind power represent a significant fraction of the total global energy input into the ocean circulation, it is also critical in maintaining the east-west tilt of the ocean thermocline along the equator. The differences in the wind power estimates are due to discrepancies in the wind stress used to force the models and discrepancies in the surface currents the models simulate, particularly the <b>North</b> <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Counter</b> <b>Current</b> and the South Equatorial Current. Decadal variations in the wind power, more prominent in some models, show a distinct decrease in the wind power in the late 1970 s, consistent with the climate regime shift of that time and a flattening of the equatorial thermocline.

Both delta C- 13 and delta N- 15 isotopic values increased with zooplankton size class. The largest zooplankton group (> 2000 mu m), with a diverse composition, showed relatively higher stable isotope signatures, covering a wider range.

McGregor et al. (2008) suggested additional complexity within this region caused by a change in the reservoir value over time in response to changing climatic conditions. We present a series of 14 new and extant published ∆R and R values on historic shells, combined with 8 values from archaeological terrestrial/marine pairs and U-Th dated coral, that support observations of localized variability caused by a complex interplay between seasonal currents, riverine input, and ocean eddies. On the basis of these values and oceanographic data, we divide the Bismarck Sea surface marine 14 C reservoir into 6 tentative subregions. In particular, our results support significant variation within channels at the southwest and southeast ends of New Britain and towards the equatorial boundary of the sea. Our results indicate that within the Bismarck Sea geographical variation appears to be more extreme than temporal over the last 3000 yr...|$|E
40|$|An upper-ocean vortex {{associated}} with tropical instabilities was observed during fall 1990 at 1408 W in the shear region between the Pacific South Equatorial Current and the <b>North</b> <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Counter</b> <b>current.</b> The velocity and thermohaline {{structures of the}} vortex were mapped in three dimensions using hydrography, acoustic Doppler current measurements, drifters, and satellite infrared images. The vortex translated westward at 30 cm s 21 (0. 248 day 21), stationary relative to the mean flow, and {{less than half the}} 80 cm s 21 speed of contemporaneous meridional oscillations of the Equatorial Undercurrent and South Equatorial Current. The coherent flow pattern was restricted to above the thermocline. Convergence at the North Equatorial Front and divergence near the vortex center occurred in a dipole pattern similar to those predicted by various numerical models. The convergence and the anticyclonic vorticity were of the same magnitudes as the local inertial frequency, suggesting that the feature was a fully nonlinear, large Rossby number vortex, and may have been subject to centrifugal instability. The anticyclonic flow was {{associated with}} a thermocline depression of 30 m and a deformation of the North Equatorial Front. Northward advection of cold, saline, equatorial water and southward advection of warmer, fresher, tropical water yielded the cusplike surface temperature pattern commonly associated with tropical in-stabilities. Equatorward heat and freshwater fluxes implied cooling and freshening from 38 N to 58 N, comparable to the annual-mean net surface heating and evaporation minus precipitation for the region. 1...|$|E
40|$|Types and {{densities of}} flotsam in the <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Counter</b> <b>Current</b> {{area of the}} western Pacific were {{recorded}} for 19 years. In all 16 types were observed, of which drift wood accounted for 81 %. Densities of flotsam fluctuated seasonally, presumably reflecting the seasonal flucutuation of rain fall on the lands where flotsam originated. The densities were relatively low in the years of El Nino period. Responses of fish on echo-sounder record positively related {{with the size of}} drift wood, whereas the effect of the flotsam size on catch with purse seine was obscured by a high degree of variance in the latter. Out of 69 hauls of the purse seine operated during the survey period for training purposa, two hauls yielded more than 100 tons of skipjack indicating extremely large school of fish sometimes accompany flotsam. 1) 西部太平洋の赤道反流域で,過去 19 年間漂流物の種類や分布密度を調べた。 2) 漂流物の種類は 16 種類におよんだが,流木が最も多く全体の 81 %に達した。 3) 漂流物の分布密度は季節により異なり、雨期と乾期の影響があることが示唆された。 4) エルニーニョ現象発生年の漂流物の分布密度は,多くの場合その季節の平均分布密度を下回った。 5) 魚探反応の強さが流木の大きさと正の相関関係を示したが,漁獲は変動がきわめて大きく,漁獲高と流木の大きさとの関係ははっきりしなかった。 6) カツオ・マグロは時として大群となって漂流物に付くことがあり, 100 トン以上の魚群を網に入れたことが 2 回あった...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a circulation model for the west African coast. The model covers all of the southern Atlantic but has enhanced resolution along the west African coast and in particular in the Angola Basin and Gulf of Guinea. An 11 year hind cast run was performed from 1986 to 1996 using synoptic forcing fields. This simulation has produced {{a large amount of}} data which has been analyzed and intercompared with results in the open literature, and a validation has been carried out using current meter data from several locations off the west coast of Africa. Introduction The oceanic processes along the western coast of Africa are strongly influenced by the Equatorial current system. The Northern <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Counter</b> <b>Current</b> (NECC) which continues as the Guinea Current (GC) induces strong currents and upwelling along the Ivory Coast. The Benguela Current (BC) originates from the dynamically active Benguela upwelling zone and propagates Northwards along the coast until it sepa [...] ...|$|R
40|$|During {{three to}} four < 518 O cycles (determined on Globigerinoides ruber), more {{positive}} S 18 O (= higher global ice vol-ume) values correlated with higher Globorotalia menardii percentages, total numbers of benthic foraminifers, number of benthic foraminifer species, and the percent of total foraminifers composed of benthic foraminifers. During the same intervals, barite and insoluble residues also generally recorded higher values; however, there was no clear evidence of systematic variation in cadmium/calcium ratios (in benthic foraminifers). Maximum percentages of Globigerinoides sacculifer and Globigerinoides ruber correlate with more negative 518 O (= lower global ice volume) values, although they sometimes appear to lead the 518 O changes by < = 4, 000 yr. The increase in percentage of the tropical "divergence " planktonic foraminifer species G. menardii and the reduc-tion of the "nondivergence " tropical species G. ruber and G. sacculifer at times of inferred ice growth is attributed to periodic intensification of divergence associated with the <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Counter</b> <b>Current.</b> Barite and insoluble residue sedi-mentation at the site also generally show a relative increase at those times...|$|R
