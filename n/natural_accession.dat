In Arabidopsis thaliana, alleles responsible for intraspecific morphological variation {{are increasingly being}} identified. However, the fitness consequences remain unclear in most cases. • Here, the fitness effects of alleles of the BRX gene are investigated. A brx loss-of-function allele, which {{was found in a}} <b>natural</b> <b>accession,</b> results in a highly branched but poorly elongated root system. • Comparison between the control accession Sav- 0 and an introgression of brx into this background (brx S) indicated that, surprisingly, brx loss of function did not negatively affect fitness in pure stands. However, in mixed, well-watered stands brx S performance and reproductive output decreased significantly, as the proportion of Sav- 0 neighbors increased. Additional comparisons between brx S and a brx S line that was complemented by a BRX transgene confirmed a direct effect of the loss-of-function allele on plant performance, as indicated by restored competitive ability of the transgenic genotype. Further, because plant height was very similar across genotypes and because the experimental setup largely excluded shading effects, the impaired competitiveness of the brx loss-of-function genotype likely reflects below-ground competition. • In summary, these data reveal conditional fitness effects of a single gene polymorphism in response to intraspecific competition in Arabidopsis...|$|E

THE production of new heritable phenotypic variation isan essential aspect of evolution. It shapes the capacity of a population to adapt to environmental change and thus provides the raw material for natural selection. Our current view posits rare DNA sequence mutations as the primary source of this process (Ossowski et al. 2010).

40|$|Offspring {{number and}} size are key traits {{determining}} an individual’s fitness and a crop’s yield. Yet, extensive natural variation within species is observed for these traits. Such variation is typically explained by trade-offs between fecundity and quality, for which an optimal solution is environmentally dependent. Understanding the genetic basis of seed size and number, {{as well as}} any possible genetic constraints preventing the maximization of both, is crucial from both an evolutionary and applied perspective. We investigated the genetic basis of natural variation in seed size and number using a set of Arabidopsis thaliana multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) lines. We also tested whether life history affects seed size, number, and their trade-off. We found that both seed size and seed number are affected by a large number of mostly nonoverlapping QTL, suggesting that seed size and seed number can evolve independently. The allele that increases seed size at most identified QTL is from the same <b>natural</b> <b>accession,</b> indicating past occurrence of directional selection for seed size. Although a significant trade-off between seed size and number is observed, its expression depends on life-history characteristics, and generally explains little variance. We conclude that the trade-off between seed size and number might have a minor role in explaining the maintenance of variation in seed size and number, and that seed size could be a valid target for selection...|$|E
40|$|Malate {{transporters}} play {{a critical}} role in aluminum (Al) tolerance responses for some plant species, such as Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Here, we further characterize AtALMT 1, an Arabidopsis aluminum-activated malate transporter, to clarify its specific role in malate release and Al stress responses. Malate excretion from the roots of accession Columbia was sharply induced by Al, which is concomitant with the induction of AtALMT 1 gene expression. The malate release was specific for Al among rhizotoxic stressors, namely cadmium, copper, erbium, lanthanum, sodium, and low pH, which accounts for the specific sensitivity of a null mutant to Al stress. Al-specific malate excretion can be explained by a combined regulation of AtALMT 1 expression and activation of AtALMT 1 protein, which is specific for Al. Although low pH treatment slightly induced gene expression, other treatments did not. In addition, malate excretion in Al-activated seedlings was rapidly stopped by removing Al from the solution. Other rhizotoxic stressors were not effective in maintaining malate release. Protein kinase and phosphatase inhibitor studies indicated that reversible phosphorylation was important for the transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of AtALMT 1. AtALMT 1 promoter-β-glucuronidase fusion lines revealed that AtALMT 1 has restricted expression within the root, such that unnecessary carbon loss is likely minimized. Lastly, a natural nonsense mutation allele of AtALMT 1 was identified from the Al-hypersensitive <b>natural</b> <b>accession</b> Warschau- 1...|$|E

In Medicago truncatula, MtNF-YA 1 was previously identified as a key determinant for nodule development and establishment of rhizobial symbiosis. Here we highlight a new role for this protein in compatibility to Aphanomyces euteiches, a root pathogenic oomycete. The Mtnf-ya 1 - 1 mutant plants showed better survival rate, reduced symptoms, and increased development of their root apparatus as compared to their wild type background A 17. MtNF-YA- 1 was specifically up-regulated by A. euteiches in F 83005. 5, a highly susceptible <b>natural</b> <b>accession</b> of M. truncatula while transcript level remained stable in A 17, which is partially resistant. The role of MtNF-YA 1 in F 83005. 5 susceptibility was further documented by reducing MtNF-YA 1 expression either by overexpression of the miR 169 q, a microRNA targeting MtNF-YA 1, or by RNAi approaches leading to a strong enhancement in the resistance of this susceptible line. Comparative analysis of the transcriptome of wild type and Mtnf-ya 1 - 1 led to the identification of 1509 differentially expressed genes. Among those, almost 36 defence-related genes were constitutively expressed in Mtnf-ya 1 - 1, while 20 genes linked to hormonal pathways were repressed.

In order to study the circadian clock in <b>natural</b> <b>accessions</b> of Neurospora multiple techniques have been explored.

In this study, we measure the quantitative responses of disease symptoms and plant fitness to a gradient of infection, focusing on the gene-for-gene interaction between the Rpm 1 resistance gene in Arabidopsis thaliana and the AvrRpm 1 avirulence gene in the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Two complementary sets of plant material were used: resistant (R) and susceptible (S) isogenic lines and a set of six <b>natural</b> <b>accessions,</b> three of which are Rpm 1 resistant (R) and three of which are rpm 1 susceptible (S). Nine initial pathogen densities were applied to each plant line. Using isogenic lines allows any differences between R and S lines to be attributed directly to the Rpm 1 gene, whereas using <b>natural</b> <b>accessions</b> allows the <b>natural</b> variation of resistance and tolerance over a gradient of infection dosages within R and S accessions to be described. For both sets of plant material, increased infection dosage results in more extensive disease symptoms, with a subsequent decrease in seed production. The severity of disease symptoms was reduced in R relative to S subgroups, and the presence of the Rpm 1 allele led to an increase in plant fitness. Tolerance, defined as the ability to sustain infection without a reduction in fitness, was directly affected by Rpm 1, providing a novel demonstration of an R gene affecting tolerance. Genetic variation for tolerance was also found within the S and R <b>natural</b> <b>accessions,</b> suggesting the potential for selection to act upon this important trait...|$|R

These data management tools should integrate defined workflow controls for genomic-scale data acquisition and validation, data storage and retrieval, and data analysis, indexed around the genomic information of the organism of interest. To maximize the impact of these large datasets, it is critical that they are rapidly disseminated to the broader research community, allowing open access for data mining and discovery. We describe here a system that incorporates such functionalities developed around the Purdue University high-throughput ionomics phenotyping platform.

We looked for variation in resistance to R. solani AG 8 in a diverse Bd <b>natural</b> <b>accession</b> collection and in Bd T-DNA insertion lines selected based on putative mechanisms reported for tagged genes. All lines were susceptible to the pathogen. Repeatable and significant variation in resistance was measured in both groups, with greater variation in resistance found across the natural accessions than in the T-DNA lines. The widest and most repeatable variation in resistance was between lines Koz- 3 and BdTR 13 a. The ratio of R. solani AG 8 -inoculated to uninoculated root length for line Koz- 3 was 33 % greater than the same ratio for line BdTR 13 a. The increased resistance of Koz- 3 was associated with nodal root initiation in response to the pathogen. A negative correlation between seedling vigour and resistance was observed, but found not to be the sole source of variation in resistance to R. solani AG 8. The only T-DNA line with significantly greater resistance to R. solani AG 8 than the reference line had an insertion in a putative galactosyltransferase gene; however, this result needs further confirmation. Genetic resistance to Rhizoctonia root rot is not available in wheat cultivars and only a few instances of quantitative resistance to the pathogen have been described within close relatives of wheat. Brachypodium distachyon offers potential for further investigation to find genes associated with quantitative resistance and mechanisms of tolerance to R. solani AG 8...|$|E

The main purpose of this case study is to investigate whether or not there was a significant agricultural change in this Reserve, particularly in the colonial period 1923 - 1939. The Ntabazinduna area was sparsely populated before 1918. After the First World War the African population and number of livestock increased rapidly in the Reserve because of new immigrants from the Insiza District and <b>natural</b> <b>accession.</b> Then, the African cultivators were often faced with serious problems of congestion, poor harvests and overstocking. Oral and written sources do not suggest that there was tension between the new immigrants and the local population. In response to a general realisation that the Reserves generally were deteriorating alarmingly, the Colonial State intervened in the African agrarian sector between 1920 and 1939. The White Settler Government's chief agents of change in this area were Alvord, the Agriculturalist for Natives, the NC of the Bubi District and a trained African Agricultural Demonstrator. These men went out to the Reserve where they carried out agricultural experiments in the inter-war period. It was hoped that after they had delivered lectures and conducted these experiments, then the African cultivators would abandon their old ways of farming and adopt new, scientific agricultural methods which were introduced into the Reserve by the Colonial State's agents of change. As African cultivators used these new agricultural techniques, it was assumed that they would probably be in a better position to grow enough food for local consumption. In that way some of the above economic problems could be solved. This dissertation attempts to measure the responses of the African cultivators to the agricultural experiments conducted by Alvord and the demonstrators in the Ntabazinduna Reserve. In addition, this case-study will make use of new oral evidence collected by certain individuals and submitted to the National Archives of Zimbabwe. This new material will be checked against published and unpublished sources or vice versa. Oral evidence which I collected from some elderly people of the Ntabazinduna Reserve between 1983 and 1988 will also be used to throw light on the subject of agricultural change...|$|E

A three-fold quantitative variation in total leaf O-AS was found among the <b>natural</b> <b>accessions.</b> Experiments with <b>natural</b> <b>accessions</b> and crosses between high- and low-O-AS accessions revealed that total O-AS levels were associated with resistance against herbivores and pathogens.

Finally, silencing {{the expression of a}} putative branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase E 1 beta subunit encoding gene (NaBCKDE 1 B) in the trichomes reduced total leaf O-AS by 20 - 30 % and increased susceptibility to Fusarium pathogens.

40|$|Although the {{occurrence}} of epistasis and pleiotropy is widely accepted at the molecular level, {{its effect on the}} adaptive value of fitness-related genes is rarely investigated in plants. Knowledge of these features of a gene is critical to understand the molecular basis of adaptive evolution. Here we investigate the importance of pleiotropy and epistasis in determining the adaptive value of a candidate gene using the gene FRI (FRIGIDA), which is thought to be the major gene controlling flowering time variation in Arabidopsis thaliana. The effect of FRI on flowering time was analyzed in an outbred population created by randomly mating 19 <b>natural</b> <b>accessions</b> of A. thaliana. This unique population allows the estimation of FRI effects independent of any linkage association with other loci due to demographic processes or to coadapted genes. It also allows for the estimation of pleiotropic effects of FRI on fitness and inflorescence architecture. We found that FRI explains less variation in flowering time than previously observed among <b>natural</b> <b>accessions,</b> and interacts epistatically with the FLC locus. Although early flowering plants produce more fruits under spring conditions, and nonfunctional alleles of FRI were associated with early flowering, variation at FRI was not associated with fitness. We show that nonfunctional FRI alleles have negative pleiotropic effects on fitness by reducing the numbers of nodes and branches on the inflorescence.

Taken together, these observations provide a first indication that de novo originated genes might be particularly prone to epigenetic variation in their initial stages of formation...|$|R

Uncovering the genetic architecture underlying mineral ion homeostasis in plants is a critical first step towards understanding the biochemical networks that regulate a plant's {{elemental composition}} (ionome). <b>Natural</b> <b>accessions</b> of Arabidopsis thaliana provide a rich source of genetic diversity that leads to phenotypic differences. We analyzed the concentrations of 17 different elements in 12 A. thaliana accessions and three recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations grown in several different environments using high-throughput inductively coupled plasma- mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Significant differences were detected between the accessions for most elements and we identified over a hundred QTLs for elemental accumulation in the RIL populations. Altering the environment the plants were grown in had a strong effect on the correlations between different elements and the QTLs controlling elemental accumulation.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of BiologyMark UngererElucidating the {{molecular}} basis of adaptive phenotypic variation represents a central aim in evolutionary biology. Using the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana, I studied the intra-specific variation in freezing tolerance among <b>natural</b> <b>accessions</b> across its native range. Considerable variation in freezing tolerance among 71 selected accessions was observed both {{with and without}} a prior cold acclimation treatment, suggesting that both differences in cold-acclimation capacity and in intrinsic physiology contribute to this variation. A highly significant positive relationship was observed between freezing tolerance and latitude of origin of these accessions. This clinal pattern of variation {{is found to be}} attributable, at least in part, to relaxed purifying selection on CBF/DREB 1 genes in the species’ southern range. These CBF/DREB 1 genes encode transcriptional activators that {{play a critical role in}} the ability of A. thaliana plants to undergo cold acclimation and thereby achieve maximum freezing tolerance. Relative to accessions from northern regions, accessions of A. thaliana from the southern part of their geographic range exhibit significantly higher levels of nonsynonymous polymorphisms in coding regions of CBF/DREB 1 genes. Relaxed selection on the CBF/DREB 1 s in southern accessions also has resulted in mutations in regulatory regions that lead to abrogated expression. These mutations in coding and regulatory regions compromise the function of CBF/DREB 1 transcriptional activators during the cold acclimation process, as determined by reductions in rates of induction and maximum levels of expression in the downstream genes they regulate. These mutations could be selective neutral or beneficial in southern accessions depending on whether there is an allocation cost associated with cold acclimation. The fitness benefit and possible allocation cost of cold acclimation was examined in freezing and freezing-free environments using <b>natural</b> <b>accessions</b> exhibiting contrasting abilities of cold acclimation as well as transgenic CBF gene over-expression or knockdown/knockout lines. The extent to which cold acclimation benefits the plant in presence of freezing temperature is revealed, but a cost of cold acclimation wasn’t detected in the absence of freezing temperature under our experimental design, which suggests that these mutations in CBF genes in southern accessions might be neutral to natural selection...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{variation}} {{has been}} observed for various traits in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we investigated natural variation {{in the context of}} physiological and transcriptional responses to the phytohormone auxin, a key regulator of plant development. A survey of the general extent of natural variation to auxin stimuli revealed significant physiological variation among 20 genetically diverse <b>natural</b> <b>accessions.</b> Moreover, we observed dramatic variation on the global transcriptome level after induction of auxin responses in seven accessions. Although we detect isolated cases of major-effect polymorphisms, sequencing of signaling genes revealed sequence conservation, making selective pressures that favor functionally different protein variants among accessions unlikely. However, coexpression analyses of a priori defined auxin signaling networks identified variations in the transcriptional equilibrium of signaling components. In agreement with this, cluster analyses of genome-wide expression profiles followed by analyses of a posteriori defined gene networks revealed accession-specific auxin responses. We hypothesize that quantitative distortions in the ratios of interacting signaling components contribute to the detected transcriptional variation, resulting in physiological variation of auxin responses among accessions...|$|R
