2500|$|China's Wei Yanan {{brought the}} women's record down to 2:25:06 in 2002, {{knocking}} over five minutes off the previous course best. Gert Thys had two consecutive victories in 2003 and 2004 (recording a record time of 2:07:06 in the latter), but a third win in 2006 was erased after he failed a drugs {{test for the}} banned steroid <b>norandrosterone.</b> [...] The runner-up Jason Mbote was declared the winner, but after a protracted legal battle Thys had his ban overturned in 2012 due to a breach of the rules in the way his sample was handled. At the 2002 edition, Zhou Chunxiu of PR China became the seventh woman to ever finish under two hours and twenty minutes as she set the women's record at 2:19:51 hours. Kenyan runner Sylvester Teimet beat the men's record in 2010 with his win in 2:06:49 hours. Three Kenyans went under this time in 2012, with Wilson Loyanae's time of 2:05:37 hours knocking {{more than a minute}} off the record.|$|E

50|$|At the 2000 Summer Olympics, {{he won the}} {{freestyle}} tournament, {{winning the}} final 4 - 0 against Brandon Slay. Leipold then tested positive for <b>norandrosterone</b> and norethiocholanolone, which are used to prove {{the presence of the}} steroid nandrolone, and the gold medal was awarded to Slay. Prince Alexandre de Merode, the chairman of the IOC medical commission, was quoted as saying that Leipold's sample showed 20 nanograms of nandrolone per milliliter of urine, whereas the limit was 2 nanograms per milliliter.|$|E
50|$|On May 8, 2011 Manju Wanniarachchi was {{provisionally}} disqualified by the Commonwealth Games Federation after {{testing positive}} for <b>Norandrosterone</b> during the Games. He had 21 days to appeal the decision but on May 26 announced {{that he did not}} wish to file an appeal and retired from the sport. On 6 June 2011 the Commonwealth Games Federation announced Sean McGoldrick of Wales as the new gold medallist. Tirafalo Seoko of Botswana was upgraded from bronze to silver on the basis that he had lost to Wanniarachchi in the semi-finals. Nicholas Okoth of Kenya joins Louis Julie from Mauritius as a bronze medal winner.|$|E
50|$|Thipe {{also sought}} to qualify for her second Olympics in London. She {{finished}} fifth in {{the final of the}} 400 metres at the 2012 African Athletics Championships in Porto Novo, Benin; however, her time of 52.26 seconds was insufficient to secure her place at the Olympics. On October 16, 2012, Thipe was among the ten South African athletes who had failed the drug test for banned substances, including <b>norandrosterone,</b> from the African Championships. She blamed the national team's doctor for prescribing her a contraceptive pill called Norlevo, which contains the banned substance, and slammed Athletics South Africa (ASA) for their failure to follow correct procedure by disclosing the results of her doping test to the media before convening a hearing in which she could defend herself.|$|E

5000|$|He {{also had}} success in East Asia at the Seoul International Marathon, where he won three times between 2003 and 2006, {{as well as}} taking the runner-up spot in 2005. However, he was disqualified after his 2006 win because his doping test at the race was {{positive}} for the banned steroid <b>norandrosterone.</b> Thys contested the outcome and a protracted hearing following his competitive ban by Athletics South Africa eventually resulted in his exoneration. Laboratory errors in processing his sample meant the Court of Arbitration for Sport CAS found in his favour. In May 2010 the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland overruled this decision, declaring that the CAS has no jurisdiction over this case. Thys successfully argued to the court {{that the fact that}} the same technician had analysed both his positive samples (a breach of the anti-doping rules) had meant that the validity of the tests could not stand. His doping ban was overturned on this basis in 2012 and he was re-instated as the winner of the 2006 Seoul Marathon.|$|E
40|$|Nandrolone (19 -nortestosterone) is an {{anabolic}} androgenic steroid commonly abused for doping purposes. Nandrolone {{is mainly}} metabolized in the liver into 19 -norandrosterone prior to glucuronidation and excretion through urine {{over an extended period}} of time. Several UGTs (i. e. UGT 2 B 7, UGT 2 B 15 and UGT 2 B 17) are thought to be the major enzymes responsible for conjugation of androgens in human. An in-vitro study using recombinant enzymes expressed in insect cells showed that UGT 1 A 4 and UGT 2 B 7 are the two main enzymes responsible of 19 -norandrosterone glucuronidation. However, the identity of the enzyme involved in nandrolone metabolism in vivo together with their relative contribution and regulation remain unknown. Inhibition assays using human liver microsomes incubated with 19 -norandrosterone and selective inhibitors confirmed that UGT 2 B 7 and UGT 2 B 15 are involved in 19 -norandrosterone glucuronidation, since the presence of the specific UGT 2 B 7 and UGT 2 B 15 inhibitors gemfibrosil and valproic acid inhibited the 19 -norandrosterone glucuronidation by 35 and 45 %, respectively. Human liver microsomes were genotyped for UGT 2 B 15 D 85 Y, UGT 2 B 7 H 268 Y and the UGT 2 B 17 deletion polymorphism. The glucuronidation activity on 19 <b>norandrosterone</b> was significantly higher in UGT 2 B 15 DD than in the other UGT 2 B 15 genotypes (p< 0. 05). Moreover, human liver cancer HepG 2 cells were exposed to androgens to determine if the transcriptional activity of the genes of interest was affected. Only UGT 2 B 7 mRNA expression was significantly increased (1. 8 -folds) after incubation with nandrolone decanoate. These results show that the UGT 2 B 7 and UGT 2 B 15 are involved in 19 -norandrosterone glucuronidation and that the UGT 2 B 15 polymorphism (D 85 Y) is the only UGT genetic variation that influences the glucuronidation activity. This could partly explain the inter-individual variation in 19 <b>norandrosterone</b> excretion...|$|E
40|$|The {{previously}} presented {{screening method}} for doping substances using GC-MS/MS by Van Eenoo et al. {{has been one}} year in operation in our laboratory. This experience allowed us to make improvements to this method in terms of detection limits and quality control. Now the method is able to detect over 150 compounds from different classes (steroids, narcotics, stimulants, beta- 2 -agonists and hormone antagonists) in a qualitative way. In the quantitative part, the traditional steroid profile with most important endogenous steroids is expanded {{in order to improve}} the detection and identification of endogenous steroid misuse. Besides these also <b>norandrosterone,</b> salbutamol, morfine and the major metabolite of cannabis are quantified. Methods developed for anti-doping purposes should be subjected to the highest level of quality. Here, parameters to control each step in the methodology were added: hydrolysis efficiency, derivatisation efficiency and microbiological degradation are monitored in every single sample. Additionally, special attention is paid to the relation between parameters indicating degradation by micro-organisms and the reliability of the steroid profile. In this presentation, the modifications, improvements and ‘tricks’ will be presented...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the annual}} report of the World Anti-Doping Agency, steroids are the most {{frequently}} detected class of doping agents. Detecting the misuse of endogenously occurring steroids, i. e. steroids such as testosterone that are produced naturally by humans, {{is one of the}} most challenging issues in doping control analysis. The established thresholds for urinary concentrations or concentration ratios such as the testosterone/epitestosterone quotient are sometimes inconclusive owing to the large biological variation in these parameters. For more than 15 years, doping control laboratories focused on the carbon isotope ratios of endogenous steroids to distinguish between naturally elevated steroid profile parameters and illicit administration of steroids. A variety of different methods has been developed throughout the last decade and the number of different steroids under investigation by isotope ratio mass spectrometry has recently grown considerably. Besides <b>norandrosterone,</b> boldenone was found to occur endogenously in rare cases and the misuse of corticosteroids or epitestosterone can now be detected with the aid of carbon isotope ratios as well. In addition, steroids excreted as sulfoconjugates were investigated, and the first results regarding hydrogen isotope ratios recently became available. All of these will be presented in detail within this review together with some considerations on validation issues and on identification of parameters influencing steroidal isotope ratios in urine...|$|E
