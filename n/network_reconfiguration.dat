50|$|Congestion Management is {{performed}} automatically {{in a number}} of ways. Message routing will use alternative paths to minimize congestion. When Dynamic TDMA (DTDMA) is enabled, a unit that is not congested can donate spare transmission capacity to a congested unit. This affects the allocation of timeslots within the ONCS, but does not affect the NCT. All of this occurs automatically, with no operator or DLP actions required.The NMU can change the ONCS to redistribute capacity. This function, called <b>Network</b> <b>Reconfiguration,</b> causes little or no network interruption. The NMU provides or causes the SNC to generate a new NCS, which can have a different NCT. On successful reconfiguration the NCS becomes the new ONCS.Media parameters can be modified by the NMU in an attempt to increase the available capacity of the network. This requires the network to be temporarily paused and reinitialized with new parameters, which causes a minor interruption of network operations. This procedure is called Network Re-Initialization. The NMU can optionally provide or causes the SNC to generate a new NCS, which can have a different NCT. On successful Re-Initialization the NCS becomes the new ONCS.Unit congestion arises from two sources: the messages the DLP requests to be transmitted, and the messages received from other units that must be relayed to ensure that the messages are received by their addressees. The DLP has full control over messages it has requested to be transmitted. The DLP could delete selected requests to reduce the congestion, and it could reduce the rate of transmission requests.Tactical messages that are being relayed are normally not under control of the DLP. In cases of high congestion, however, the DLP can be informed of the relay messages and decide whether it wants to delete any. This last resort reduces the congestion, but it also affects the delivery of messages. This decision process is called Relay Flow Control.|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} this {{doctorate}} dissertation is {{the solution of the}} problem of loss reduction by <b>network</b> <b>reconfigurations</b> in Distribution <b>Networks</b> (DNs) in real time, {{and at the same time}} the investigation of potential reliability improvement. At first the implementation of a Multiagent System (MAS) that deals with both aforementioned problems is examined. In this analysis it is considered that the installation of MAS in DNs aims to optimize the problem of faults isolation and power restoration to the maximum possible number of customers within the minimum possible time period after the fault occurance. At the same time the analysis investigates whether the MAS’s installation could contribute in real time management of the network for loss reduction due to the increased automation level that incurs. The results of this analysis show that optimization of both problems presupposes universal automation upgrade in the DN and based on feasibility studies that are presented, the payback time for the required investments could be determined. Next, o novel algorithm that incorporates load variations in the problem of <b>network</b> <b>reconfigurations</b> for loss reduction is presented. It is assumed that the implementation of the proposed algorithm simulates real operational conditions since it takes into account the stochastic load variations and thus, it examines the influence of these variations to the necessary switching operations for optimal reconfigurations. The algorithm is implemented in 3 DNs of the published literature and in a real segment of the urban DN of Thessaloniki. Useful conclusions are depicted regarding the tolerance in load variations that defines whether a new reconfigured topology should be searched or not for real operational conditions. Finally, a novel method is proposed concerning selective automation upgrade in DNs that result in near optimum management for loss reduction in real time, and at the same time contributes in significant reliability improvement. ...|$|R

The proposed structure is a special type of load balanced graph designed to tolerate processor failure. In balanced hypercubes, each processor has a backup (matching) processor that shares the same set of neighboring nodes. Therefore, tasks that run on a faulty processor can be reactivated in the backup processor to provide efficient system reconfiguration. Other properties of balanced hypercubes are examined. It is also shown that odd-dimensional balanced hypercubes have smaller diameters than that of standard hypercubes.

40|$|Abstract. Dynamic <b>reconfiguration</b> of {{interconnection}} <b>networks</b> {{is defined}} as the process of changing from one routing function to another while the network remains up and running. The main challenge is in avoiding deadlock anomalies while keeping restrictions on packet injection and forwarding minimal. Current approaches fall in one of two categories.

In this paper we describe a simple and powerful method for dynamic <b>networks</b> <b>reconfiguration.</b> It guarantees a fast and deadlock-free transition from the old to the new routing function, it works for any topology and between any pair of old and new routing functions, and it guarantees in-order packet delivery when used between deterministic routing functions. ...|$|R
