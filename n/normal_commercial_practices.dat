Artists were not in a reserved occupation and were liable for call up for military service along with everyone else. Many were recalled from the services to work for the Ministry in 1942, a year in which £4 million was spent on publicity, approximately a third more than in 1941. £120,000 of this was spent on posters, art and exhibitions. Of the many officially employed war artists, several, including Eric Kennington, Paul Nash and William Rothenstein, were war artists during both World Wars. Many extra designs were prepared to cope with short lead-times and the changing events of war. Through the Home intelligence Division, the MOI collected reactions to general wartime morale and, in some cases, specifically to publicity produced.|$|R

Initially cold stored plants were used for early spring cropping only. Meanwhile this technique has become a <b>normal</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>practice</b> among growers in central Europe and has given them the opportunity to extend the strawberry production season from July until January. Cold stored waiting bed plants have been used since the early seventies in The Netherlands and Belgium and currently represent an important part of strawberry production. These sixty-day-plants are planted mainly outdoors in the soil for a production from July until September. More recently waiting bed plants have gained popularity in the UK, Germany and northern Italy to extend the season. Alternatively in France and Germany cold stored runner (A+) plants are traditionally being used for a summer production outdoors followed by a spring crop. During the last decade module or tray plants have gained popularity for autumn cropping on substrate culture in plastic tunnels and greenhouses. During the most recent years the programmed ¿out of season¿ production of strawberries has become more important in several European countries.

40|$|Leaf removal is a <b>normal</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>practice</b> in {{viticulture}} {{to lower}} disease pressure through reduction in humidity and increased light exposure. However, New Zealand has 30 - 40 % {{higher levels of}} UV radiation compared to similar latitudes in the Northern hemisphere, an increase of light exposure may therefore have a profound influence on berry composition. The aim {{of this research was}} {{to determine the effects of}} leaf removal and UV-B on flavonoid biosynthesis and regulation of gene activity in Vitis vinifera L. var. Sauvignon blanc grapes, particularly those genes associated with the low and high fluence UV-B responses. During the 2010 and 2011 seasons, three north-south oriented rows of Sauvignon blanc grapevines in the Lincoln University research vineyard were chosen to study the specific effects of UV-B on flavonoid accumulation and gene expression. This was achieved by using a combination of leaf removal and plastic screening techniques, which alter the light environment that the fruits are exposed to. UV-B exposure had a dramatic effect on the physical appearance of the berries causing specific pigmentation post-veraison. However, the accumulation of the total soluble solids and berry tissue development were not affected either by leaf removal around the fruiting zone or increased exposure to UV-B. In contrast, flavonols, particularly quercetin and kaempferol glycosides, increased substantially on fruit exposure due to UV-B. Spatial analysis of these flavonols located the changes to the berry skin. To understand the role of UV-B in regulating flavonoid biosynthesis, the transcript abundance for genes and transcription factors that are involved in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway were analysed by qRT-PCR. These genes include five flavonol synthase genes (VvFLS 1 - 5), three chalcone synthase genes (VvCHS 1 - 3), and genes for the MYB-bHLH-WD 40 transcription factor complex (VvMYB 12, VvMYCA 1 and VvWDRs). Of the five identified VvFLS, only two (VvFLS 4 and VvFLS 5) were found to be transcriptionally active in Sauvignon blanc berries and responsive to UV-B exposure. Of three VvCHS, only VvCHS 1 and VvCHS 2 showed a significant UV-B induction. Of the transcription factor genes, only VvMYB 12 was found to be responsive to UV-B radiation and its expression pattern was consistent with VvFLS. The relative involvement of genes in the high and low fluence UV-B transduction pathways (VvUVR 8, VvHY 5 and VvCOP 1; PR genes and VvMAPK 3; respectively) were also studied. VvUVR 8 did not response to UV-B but showed a developmental regulation. A similar lack of a UV-B response was found for VvCOP 1. In contrast, VvHY 5 showed a UV-B induction and higher levels of transcript abundance took place at harvest. All of PR genes showed a significant developmental regulation, with very low or no detectable transcript abundance pre-veraison and high transcript abundance post-veraison. These PR genes were not responsive to the natural fluence UV-B in the vineyard environment, but some showed a significant UV-B induction to a relatively high fluence UV-B under the controlled environment. Overall, this study clearly demonstrates the effect of UV-B exposure on the flavonoid biosynthesis in Sauvignon blanc grapes is achieved through a complex regulation of genes and transcription factors involved in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. This research makes a substantial contribution, not only in improvement of our scientific understanding of UV-B responses in important commercial species, but also provides valuable information for vineyard management to ultimately improve wine quality...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUnfair <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices</b> Directive {{remains one}} of the most ambitious acts of {{secondary}} legislation adopted in the field of consumer protection over the past decade. This legal instrument seeks to establish a common European understanding of “unfairness” in business-to-consumer legal relations. Hereby Directive introduced a comprehensive regulatory regime applied to all types of commercial activities that can influence the economic behavior of consumers, covering any business-to-consumer <b>commercial</b> <b>practice</b> before, during and after a transaction, thus including marketing, negotiation, sales practices and after-sales conduct. Unfair <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices</b> Directive into Lithuanian legal system was transposed by adopting a completely new legal act – Law on Prohibition of Unfair Business-to-Consumer <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices</b> of the Republic of Lithuania. The implementation of the Unfair <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices</b> Directive in Lithuania led to a split-up between misleading business-to-consumer <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> and misleading business-to-business advertising regulation regimes. Implementing act among other rules introduced into the national legal system provisions on the prohibition of misleading <b>commercial</b> <b>practices,</b> ensuring that consumers are not misled, thus enabling them to make informed and reasonable choices. The purpose of this article is to examine the norms of national act, implementing the prohibition of misleading <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> into the national legal system in the context of implementing provisions of the other Member States and to reveal core national regulation and application problems. Also, having in mind that in the text of the Directive a distinction between misleading actions and misleading omissions is made, it is analyzed whether the clear line between the application of these rules is made in legal practice. In conclusion authors formulate key recommendations for consumer protection institutions and courts, applying the rules on misleading <b>commercial</b> <b>practices...</b>|$|R

Each section compares the European protection of aggressive <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> (and also through European legislation implemented in Czech law) with the protection of those practices in U. S. law. The first part of thesis deals with the protection of consumers against aggressive <b>commercial</b> <b>practices.</b> In European law it mainly regulated by Directive on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices.</b> The Directive is implemented in Czech Republic in mainly in Consumer Protection Code and in the Advertising Code. Private protection against aggressive <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> is embodied in provision of unfair competition of the Commercial Code. Protection of personality, privacy and personal data is another form of protection against aggressive practices. In U. S. law, public consumer protection is represented by Federal Trade Commission. In private law, consumers seek redress in court through actions for torts. In relations between competitors is the protection against aggressive <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> regulated by unfair competition and by antirust law. Antitrust law in European Union is represented by 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty. Unfair Competition Law in the U. S. in the B 2 B market is the part of business torts. Antitrust law is represented by Federal Trade Commission and the Ministry of Justice.

40|$|Since the {{adoption}} of the European directive on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices,</b> its provisions started to apply alongside the existing sector-specific European legislation on consumer protection. With the aim of ensuring a coherent system of European consumer law, the directive stated that, in the case of conflict between its rules and other Community law regulating specific aspects of unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices,</b> the latter shall prevail and apply to those aspects. The directive, however, did not mandate any enforcement mechanism at the national level. The Italian legislation which implemented the European directive conferred a general enforcement power on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> to the national antitrust authority. Italian law was not, however, very clear regarding the competence of the agency in markets subject to the oversight of a different sector-specific authority. This issue was raised before the Italian administrative law Court which, at first, seemed to limit the general competence of the antitrust authority in fields where the contested practices were also considered by sector-specific regulation. For this reason, the European Commission started an infringement proceeding against Italy for not having correctly implemented the directive on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices.</b> As a consequence, a recent reform in Italian law conferred the antitrust authority an exclusive competence to combat unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> also in regulated sectors, after having consulted the sector-specific regulator, apart when the breach of sector-specific regulation does not result in an unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practice.</b> After {{the adoption}} of this provision, the Italian administrative judge finally interpreted the law on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practice</b> consistently with the European directive. The Court denied that {{the adoption of}} secondary legislation by a national sector-specific regulators can exclude the application of the general provisions on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> and affirmed the relevant enforcement competence of the antitrust authority also in regulated sectors. In the light of these different approaches, this paper will attempt to examine the benefits and the drawbacks of the enforcement mechanisms endorsed by the Italian Courts and legislator. The aim of the work is to assess, from a legal perspective, which role should the general antitrust authority play in the enforcement of unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> in markets subject to sector-specific regulation. </p...|$|R
