40|$|In many {{countries}} of the world investments are made for obtaining energy efficiency, pursuing to increase the generation of <b>non-polluting</b> <b>fuels</b> {{due to the fact that}} energy is vital for any economy. The increase in <b>non-polluting</b> <b>fuels</b> and in renewable energy generation might lead to diminishing the dependence of countries less endowed with conventional energy resources on oil and natural gas from Russia or from Arab countries. Nevertheless, environmental issues represent serious questions facing the mankind, requiring the identification, prevention, and why not, their total solving. European Union countries depend on imports of energy, especially on oil imports. At the same time, the European Union countries record a high volume of greenhouse gas emissions, substances adding to global warming. The transport sector is the main consumer of fossil fuels and generator of greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, diversifying the energy supply used in the transport sector with less polluting sources is an essential objective of the European Union policy in the transport, energy and environment sector. Road transports’ is the sector recording the highest consumption of energy and the highest volume of greenhouse gas emissions. The use of ecologic fuels in the transport sector is an important factor for achieving the objectives of European policies in the field.

The three-fuel mixture consist of diesel, turpentine blend and acetylene gas. Acetylene gas is produced from lime stone (CaCO 3) and turpentine oil is obtained from pine trees. The performance of the three-fuel mixture has been analyzed experimentally in a single cylinder direct injection and compression ignition engine with diesel and turpentine blend as primary fuel and acetylene as secondary gaseous fuel i. e., diesel and turpentine blend (40 % turpentine(40 T) and 60 % diesel) were considered for the study. The results have shown that the blend and the acetylene gas flow rate of 3 liters per minute (through a gas flow meter) offer higher brake thermal efficiency by between 1 % and 3 % than the fuel of the baseline diesel operation...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen is {{regarded}} in certain quarters as the ultimate, <b>non-polluting</b> <b>fuel</b> and energy storage medium for future centuries. This view {{is based upon}} a scenario in which fossil fuels are reserved for chemical use, while other primary energy sources are employed to generate hydrogen from water. This paper reviews briefly the prospects for such a future and outlines the technical and engineering problems to be solved and the economic disincentives in terms of present-day fuel prices. Likely trends in hydrogen production technology are discussed, followed by a consideration of hydrogen storage, either as liquid hydrogen or {{in the form of}} metallic hydrides. Future uses of hydrogen are reviewed, first as a chemical in industry, then as a fuel for heating purposes and finally as a portable fuel for aircraft and road vehicles. In reaching a conclusion as to the prospects for hydrogen, the importance of timescales is emphasised, together with likely technical developments in the primary energy sectors. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is getting}} more and more a {{significant}} problem for governments, industrials and the eco-system itself that known transportation systems do not provide the market between fast airplanes with small payloads and slow ships with weighty payloads. Without affecting the eco-system with harbors, rails, highways, runways and exhaust gases actual and future transportation needs seem to be impossible. Conventional airships are very sensitive towards weather, fly slowly and mostly necessitate a ground-crew while take off and landing due to its large surface. The proposed aircraft concerns a VTOL hybrid airplane with the synergetic advantage, that every component which is necessary for a rotation symmetric VTOL, also can be used for a mirror symmetric cruise, whilst during take-off, cruise-flight and landing the demanded lift will be generated in a hybrid way using dynamic lift and static buoyancy. At the same time the potential capacities of lighter-thanair constructions to lift heavy payloads are exploited optimal through a lenticular shell. Two wings with fully symmetric airfoils are mounted marginally while both, the front and the back of the airfoils, can be flapped in a definite angle. It is consequently possible to adopt an axially symmetric configuration (helicopter) as well as a mirror-symmetrical configuration (airplane). The power supply consists of <b>non-polluting</b> <b>fuel</b> and solar cells. This paper presents the functionality, the short-term plans for research and development of such a small scale slowly flying autonomous observation drone and plans to the long-run realization of the introduced hybrid airplane for the described middle market gap...|$|E
40|$|The {{global economy}} {{development}} {{has not only}} positive effects but also negative consequences, in terms of air pollution with a major impact against the climate change and human health. This fact stimulated the intensification of research endeavours to identify and develop new options for sustainable energy supply and further for reducing the dependence on fossil fuels, as considered the major air pollutants globally. Among the <b>non-polluting</b> <b>fuels,</b> the currently biodiesel second generation becomes a viable solution {{in order to develop}} an alternative sustainable source of fueling. Even if this type of fuel has been implemented and approved as viable for land and air transportation meanings, the maritime transportation sector is still reluctant in implementing this new fuel on board to commercial vessels.

40|$|Biodiesel {{is a more}} {{attractive}} alternative fuel to diesel engines. Because, it is a renewable and <b>non-polluted</b> <b>fuel</b> that can be produced from plant and animal fats. Biodiesel emits low pollutants (except NOx) than petroleum diesel. But the major problem arises for the commercialization of biodiesel is its cost. Since most of the biodiesels were derived from edible oils like soy bean, sunflower, rapeseed, palm etc. These oils are essentially edible in India and other developing countries. On the other hand, diversion of edible oils as feed stocks for biodiesel production leads to food crisis. Therefore this research mainly concentrates the non-edible oils as feed stocks for biodiesel production {{to reduce the cost}} of biodiesel. Normally alkali catalyzed method was followed for biodiesel production process. However the non-edible oils having high FFA content which is not suitable for normal transesterification process. Hence a two-step catalyzed method was used to prepare the biodiesel. For this study the following non-edible oil samples such as Jatropha, Pongamia, Madhuca and Azhadirachta were used to extract the biodiesel. For this study biodiesel yield from various non-edible oils and its cost optimization were discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies {{implementation}} {{and use of}} Tradable Green Certificates in a multi-market equilibrium framework. The system of Tradable Green Certificates is designed to induce substitution from polluting fuels to renewable, i. e. <b>non-polluting,</b> <b>fuels</b> in electricity generation, and hence alleviate the climate warming problem. Our basic model {{is in line with}} Amundsen and Mortensen (2001) but we also include cost uncertainty and the social welfare analysis into our study. The model consists of two representative electricity companies, one producing electricity from conventional sources and the other producing with renewable fuels. It is assumed that the marginal cost of producing green electricity is higher than the marginal cost of producing conventional electricity. Comparative static analysis shows that the price of certificates is always increasing and the producer price of electricity decreasing in the quota. Under certain assumptions about the parameters of the cost function, the price faced by consumers increases when certificates are introduced. When tradable emission permits are included in the analysis, the consumer price can be either increasing or decreasing in the quota, and it is decreasing in the level of emissions. Uncertainty to renewable power production is introduced by assuming multiplicative random disturbance term into the cost function. Atkinson and Stiglitz (1981) show that this formulation can be used to describe, for example, a random increment to costs when weather conditions are unfavorable to power production. The results with respect to market clearing prices do not change remarkably, but it is shown that if the firms are risk averse, changes in the variability of the disturbance term could either increase or decrease the production of green electricity. Our main result is derived from the social welfare maximization problem. The result states that in the absence of emission permits the socially optimal quota for green electricity depends on the difference between the marginal costs of two representative producers. However, if emission permits are present then the optimal quota is zero. When cost uncertainty is included and the social planner is risk neutral, then the use of green certificates could increase the social welfare also in the presence of emission permits.

40|$|Hydrogen is a clean burning, <b>non-polluting</b> {{transportation}} <b>fuel.</b> It {{is also a}} {{renewable energy}} carrier that can be produced from non-fossil fuel resources such as solar, wind and biomass. Utilizing hydrogen as an alternative fuel for vehicles will diversify the resources of energy, and reduce dependence on oil in the transportation sector. Additionally, clean burning hydrogen fuel will also alleviate air pollution {{that is a very}} severe problem in many parts of world, especially major metropolitan areas in developing countries, such as India and China. In our efforts to foster international collaborations in the research, development, and demonstration of hydrogen technologies, through a USAID/DOE cost-shared project, Energy Conversion Devices, Inc.,(www. ovonic. com) a leading materials and alternative energy company, in collaboration with Bajaj Auto Limited, India's largest three-wheeler taxi manufacturer, has successfully developed and demonstrated prototype hydrogen ICE three-wheelers in the United States and India. ECD's proprietary Ovonic solid-state hydrogen storage technology is utilized on-board to provide a means of compact, low pressure, and safe hydrogen fuel. These prototype hydrogen three-wheelers have demonstrated comparable performance to the original CNG version of the vehicle, achieving a driving range of 130 km. The hydrogen storage system capable of storing 1 kg hydrogen can be refilled to 80 % of its capacity in about 15 minutes at a pressure of 300 psi. The prototype vehicles developed under this project have been showcased and made available for test rides to the public at exhibits such as the 16 th NHA annual meeting in April 2005, Washington, DC, and the SIAM (Society of Indian Automotive Manufacturers) annual conference in August 2005, New Delhi, India. Passengers have included members of the automotive industry, founders of both ECD and Bajaj, members of the World Bank, the Indian Union Minister for Finance, the President of the Asia Development Bank, members of USAID, USDOE and many other individuals, all of whom have had praise for the vehicle and the technology. The progress made through this phase I work and the importance of hydrogen three-wheelers has also resulted in extensive press coverage by the news media around the world...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{carbon dioxide}} and {{pollution}} due to the {{burning of fossil fuels}} is increasing. Many scientists attribute global warming to the rising levels of {{carbon dioxide and}} other pollutants, some of which also pose risks to health. These can be reduced by the more efficient use of conventional fuels and the development of <b>non-polluting</b> energy resources. <b>Fuel</b> cells offer a highly efficient and low polluting method of generating electricity, and are under development for both the power generation and transport sectors. There is a need to assess (a) emissions from fuel cells using various fuels and (b) ways of introducing such technology to transportation in the near future. Fuel consumption, energy and emissions from the production and use of fuels (hydrogen, methane, propane, petrol, diesel, alcohols and rape methyl ester) are calculated per kilowatt hour of fuel cell output over a range of efficiency. These are compared with those for internal combustion engines with advanced exhaust control and for the recharging of battery driven vehicles. The results, which are applicable to both transport and power generation, enable the best low pollution fuels to be selected and are used to calculate through life emissions for public transport buses. Fuel cells are an ideal solution to reduce pollution from transport, but their commercial development in this field is further away than that for stationary applications. Thus, a transition stage is recommended where fuel cell electrical power stations, based on existing demonstrators, are used to recharge fleets of battery driven vehicles during the development of mobile fuel cell systems. These fleets include public transport and commercial vehicles. Also, fuel cell power stations could provide energy for electric trains. A combined system is proposed where electric trains recharge battery driven commercial vehicles during long journeys. The above proposals would enhance fuel cell development, introducing them alongside current transport systems, possibly using the same fuel...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen, {{a wholly}} <b>non-polluting</b> and {{renewable}} <b>fuel,</b> {{may be obtained}} by the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Electrocatalytic hydrogen production calls for efficient and durable electrodes by finding {{the origin of the}} electrocatalytic activity, and improving the properties. The candidate materials for cathodes are limited. Those that have high surface area suffer from low physical stability and deterioration in long-term operation. If physical stability is improved the activity is decreased. When both properties are improved the production expense is increased. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to prepare new electrode materials and study their activity and reaction mechanism for the HER. Three categories of the electrodes of nickel phosphorous family were studied, Ni-P, Ni-Mo-P, and Ni-Zn-P. Ni-P materials are very stable in alkaline solutions. Their stability is better than Ni. Phosphorous is not removed by means of leaching the electrodes in HF, alkaline solutions, heating, and/or oxidation to produce a rough surface. Electrodes prepared at low current densities and temperature were active for the HER due to increase in the surface roughness. The most active Ni-P electrode prepared in this study had a surface roughness of 10 [subscript 3] XRD patterns of Ni-P electrodes have amorphous structure. After heating at 400 [degree Celsius] the structure of electrodes changed to crystalline with domination of Ni[subscript 3]P phase (for high phosphorous content electrodes) or Ni[subscript 3]P and Ni (for low phosphorous content electrodes). Ni-Mo-P electrodes were prepared by"multi-step" electrodeposition. The activity of the electrodes was increased through increase in surface roughness as well as intrinsic activity. Cycling of the electrodes between the HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) deactivated them. Mo was mostly dissolved during electrooxidation of these materials. Ni-Zn-P electrodes were prepared by subsequent electrodeposition of Ni, Ni-P, and Ni-Zn-P. The top-most layer was obtained by gradual addition of zinc to the plating bath. After leaching the electrodes in 30 % KOH, about 80 % of Zn was removed leading to a porous surface with a large area with excellent stability. Those prepared at high current densities are the most active ones. They are characterized by low Tafel slopes and large surface area with roughness factor of 10 [subscript 4]. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and steady-state polarization are mainly used to explain activity of the electrodes using real surface area. A new technique for the surface roughness determination i. e.,"CO molecular probe" was developed. Ni-Zn-P porous electrode surface roughness was measured by the EIS and compared with results from surface oxidation, cyclic voltammetry (cv), ratio of the polarization current densities, and CO molecular probe showing good agreement with those obtained by the EIS. Besides, the results show that dissolved CO in NaOH can be oxidized on Ni and Ni-Zn-P electrodes. This is a new observation of CO behavior on nickel based electrodes.
