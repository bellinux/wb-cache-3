5|$|At the time, {{very few}} people in Wales had seen an opera, and they had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was like. The opera {{programmes}} provided explanations, especially that the singers would wear costumes but would not be acting. Those {{who were members of}} Welsh nonconformist churches needed reassurance {{that this was not a}} theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to the tenets of his faith for his entire life. The majority of participants in the first performance of Blodwen were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and harmonium. Before the performance, Parry spoke to the audience. He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: that the participants were not acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.|$|E

500|$|... "Love Story" [...] was {{recorded}} in March 2008 at Blackbird Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, alongside record producer Nathan Chapman and various personnel. Swift sang into an Avantone CV-12 multi-pattern tube microphone, manufactured by Avant Electronics. The microphone had a new old stock tube that was designed and built by country singer, record producer, and audio engineer Ray Kennedy for Chapman. Chapman had received the microphone from Kennedy as a loan, as a [...] "try this for a while" [...] experiment. Although he previously had tested numerous microphones on Swift, {{he had not been}} able to find one to match her voice perfectly. When Swift came to Chapman's home to record a radio edit for one of the singles from Taylor Swift, she immediately grew fond of the microphone. [...] "When she put on the headphones and said, 'Test,' completely unprompted, she said, 'This is my mic. I love this mic. I just wanna use this one from now on!' She had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was, just loved it, and I went along with something that felt right for her. We've been using it ever since, and it sounds great on her voice," [...] Chapman said.|$|E
500|$|Erica Hahn was {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} minor character, and occasional guest-star rival of Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). The character first appeared in three episodes of the show's second season, followed by another two episodes of the show's third season. Discussing whether she thought Hahn might become a main character after her season three appearance, Smith has stated that at the time: [...] "I didn't really {{think it was going}} to work out", joking that [...] "After every time I would hope that they would call and also hope not too– kind of like when I used to be single." [...] However, following Washington's departure from the show, Hahn was brought back as a main character in the show's fourth season, replacing Burke as Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Smith has said that she was not expecting her character to be introduced to the show full-time, as she [...] "didn't want to be disappointed if it didn't happen." [...] She has stated that a deciding factor in her return was the opportunity it presented to explore the character in greater depth, explaining: [...] "When I work on something that has a beginning, middle and end, I can create an arc. With Dr. Hahn, I need to figure out who she is". Researching the role, Smith watched a heart surgery performed, and liaised with the surgical nurses employed by Grey's Anatomy producers to maintain realism in the show's operating room. She dubbed this research stressful, stating that [...] "I got very neurotic about the fact that I didn’t go to medical school. I’m not actually a doctor", explaining; [...] "I have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> really is to be a surgeon and yet I have to act like I am really good at it.

His death came {{during the height of the}} LDS church's fight to ban same-sex marriage in California with Prop 22 also known as Knight's Initiative. Shortly before his death he wrote a 12-page letter to his cousin in which he states that when he heard the church was asking members to donate time and money in support of Prop 22 he [...] "cried for hours in [...] room" [...] and he felt that the church's positions created an environment [...] "hostile for young gay Mormons". The letter also stated [...] "straight members have absolutely <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is like to grow up gay in this church.... It is a life of constant torment, self-hatred and internalized homophobia." [...] The same month he also wrote a letter to the editor published in the BYU newspaper pleading for the acceptance of homosexual individuals in response to a letter published five days before comparing homosexuality to pedophilia, bestiality and Satanism. Right before his death he wrote a note stating, [...] "The church has no idea that ... there are surely boys and girls on their callused hands and knees imploring God to free them of their pain. They hate themselves ... God never intended me to be straight. Hopefully, my death might be a catalyst for some good." [...] Two weeks after Stuart's death on March 9, D.J. Thompson a 33-year-old gay Mormon man in Florida completed suicide after writing a note referencing Stuart's death and stating that Proposition 22 was the [...] "last straw in my lifelong battle to see peace in the world".

The question seems to be well formed to everyone from philosophers, psychologists, and cognitive scientists, to students taking introductory philosophy classes. The answer, by contrast, seems unclear. Nonetheless, we have some <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> would take to answer such a question. In initially posing the question, the psychologist Brian Farrell (1950, 183) claimed that the only answer that would satisfy him would be the answer he would get if a sorceress changed him into a bat. More optimistic philosophers and cognitive scientists—particularly those who have spent some time in Medford, MA and San Diego, CA—tend to think that a detailed analysis of echolocation, including an account of the construction of quasi-spatial maps from the temporal properties of 30 - 120 Khz echoes, will do the trick. Hence, even though most people have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>it’s</b> like to be a bat, many remain convinced that there must be something that it’s like.
