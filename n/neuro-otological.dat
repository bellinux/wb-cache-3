40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{determine}} <b>neuro-otological</b> {{and psychiatric}} abnormalities associated with complaints of dizziness in an epidemiological community sample {{of people of}} working age, {{and the extent of}} comorbidity between <b>neuro-otological</b> and psychiatric dysfunction.  METHOD—A survey of 3884 people randomly selected from six general practice lists identified 262 people with significant dizziness, from which a subsample of 15 men and 22 women were recruited for testing. Dizzy subjects were evaluated by blind <b>neuro-otological</b> testing, computerised dynamic posturography, a computerised psychiatric assessment, <b>neuro-otological</b> and general medical examination, and diagnosis. An age matched control group of 18 men and 22 women underwent the same evaluation.  RESULTS—Tests of auditory, vestibular, and oculo-motor function did not discriminate between dizzy subjects and controls, but dizzy subjects had significantly worse balance on posturographic testing, more diagnoses of medical disorder, and a higher prevalence of psychiatric morbidity.  CONCLUSIONS—The findings suggest that dizziness in the community is typically characterised by mild physical disorder accompanied by some psychiatric disturbance. As the combination of minor physical and psychiatric disorder is known to be unusually persistent and handicapping, treatment programmes must be provided for this prevalent syndrome, perhaps by a partnership between primary care and <b>neuro-otological</b> and psychiatric hospital outpatient clinics with experience and expertise in the diagnosis and management of dizziness and psychiatric disturbance. ...|$|E

The aim was to evaluate the presence of auditory and vestibular symptoms, and assess neurophysiological involvement of the VIII cranial nerve, correlating these findings with clinical and neurophysiological features of peripheral neuropathy. We studied 36 patients with FD with a complete neurological and <b>neuro-otological</b> evaluation including nerve conduction studies, quantitative sensory testing (to evaluate small fiber by warm and cold threshold detection and cold and heat pain), vestibular evoked myogenic potentials, videonistagmography, audiometry and brainstem auditory evoked potentials. Neuro-otologic symptoms included hearing loss (22. 2 %), vertigo (27. 8 %) or both (25 %). An involvement of either cochlear or vestibular function was identified in most patients (75 %). In 70 % of our patients the involvement of both cochlear and vestibular function could not be explained by a neural or vascular mechanism. Small fiber neuropathy was identified in 77. 7 %. There were no significant associations between neurootological and QST abnormalities. Neuro-otologic involvement is frequent and most likely under-recognized in patients with FD. It lacks a specific neural or vascular pattern, suggesting multi-systemic, end organ damage.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} under-diagnosed <b>neuro-otological</b> {{disorders and}} {{to evaluate whether}} under-diagnosing depends on {{the age of the}} patient. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of medical charts from 951 consecutive patients (685 under and 266 above the age of 65 years) who entered diagnostic procedures at the Interdisciplinary Center for Vertigo and Balance Disorders, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. Final diagnoses were compared to referral diagnoses. RESULTS: Relative to referral diagnoses, the proportion of patients finally diagnosed with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) almost doubled both in younger (< 65 year from 12. 7 % to 25. 1 %) and older patients (from 20. 7 % to 37. 6 %). Striking relative increases were found for the diagnoses multisensory dizziness in older patients (from 20. 7 % to 37. 6 %) and vestibular migraine in younger patients (1. 8 % to 20. 2 %). In both age groups, the proportion of patients with undetermined diagnoses was reduced by about 60 % (younger: 69. 8 % to 9. 8 %; older: 69. 2 % to 12. 4 %) by the diagnostic procedures in the vertigo center. These changes were all significant (p < 0. 05) in McNemar tests with continuity correction (2 x 2 tables: focused diagnosis vs. other diagnoses, referral vs. final). CONCLUSION: Significant changes of diagnoses can be expected by a specialized <b>neuro-otological</b> work-up.

Five cases are presented to illustrate the potential for diagnostic delay unless a routine battery of investigations is undertaken in patients with <b>neuro-otological</b> disorders.

We found absence of waves or prolonged interpeak latencies in 25 % of the vertiginous subjects with normal hearing and magnetic resonance images of the brain. We conclude that in selected cases, lesions affecting the vestibular system can influence the ABR, and the electrophysiological tests of audition may suggest regionalization of the dysfunction in the hindbrain and midbrain.

Posturography testing showed that five patients showed abnormally large body sway induced by full field visual motion stimulation. This group included the two patients with CNS disease and four with strabismic symptoms (diplopia, squint surgery, and ocular muscle weakness). It is concluded that visual vertigo is a heterogeneous syndrome with peripheral or central aetiologies and may occur if patients with balance disorders show high visual field dependence. In patients with visual vertigo, the presence of additional CNS or strabismic symptoms may cause inappropriate postural reactions in environments with conflicting or disorienting visual stimuli, probably by reducing the ability to resolve the sensory conflict...|$|E

40|$|We {{conducted}} a retrospective observational study {{to assess the}} consequences of conservative management of vestibular schwannoma (VS). Data were collected from tertiary <b>neuro-otological</b> referral units in United Kingdom. The study included 59 patients who were managed conservatively with radiological diagnosis of VS. The main outcome measures were growth rate and rate of failure of conservative management. Multivariate analysis sought correlation between tumor growth and (i) demographic features, (ii) tumor characteristics. The mean tumor growth was 0. 66 mm/y. 11 patients (19 %) required intervention. Mean time to intervention was 37 months with two notable late “failures” occurring at 75 and 84 months. Tumors extending into the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) grew significantly faster than intracanalicular tumors (p[*]=[*] 0. 0045). No association was found between growth rate and age, sex, tumor laterality, facial nerve function, and grade of hearing loss. Conservative management is acceptable for a subset of patients. Tumors extending into the CPA at diagnosis grow significantly faster than intracanalicular tumors. No growth within 5 years of surveillance does not guarantee a continued indolent growth pattern; surveillance must therefore continue...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades methods of {{vestibular}} rehabilitation to enhance adaptation to vestibular loss, habituation to changing sensory conditions, and sensory reweighting in the compensation process have been developed. However, {{the use of these}} techniques still depends to a large part on the educational background of the therapist. Individualized assessment of deficits and specific therapeutic programs for different disorders are sparse. Currently, vestibular rehabilitation is often used in an unspecific way in dizzy patients irrespective of the clinical findings. When predicting the future of vestibular rehabilitation, it is tempting to foretell advances in technology for assessment and treatment only, but the current intense exchange between clinicians and basic scientists also predicts advances in truly understanding the complex interactions between the peripheral senses and central adaptation mechanisms. More research is needed to develop reliable techniques to measure sensory dependence and to learn how this knowledge can be best used—by playing off the patient’s sensory strength or working on the weakness.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{evaluate}} prospectively, in a group of patients affected by VN, a diagnostic protocol employing C-VEMPs, O-VEMPs and vHIT together. The diagnosis of vestibular neurolabyrinthitis was based on the clinical history, absence of associated auditory or neurological symptoms, and a <b>neuro-otological</b> examination with an evaluation of lateral semicircular canal function using the Fitzgerald-Hallpike caloric vestibular test and ice test. Our series revealed an incidence of 55  % of superior and inferior vestibular neurolabyrinthitis, 40  % of superior vestibular neurolabyrinthitis and 5  % of inferior vestibular neurolabyrinthitis. These data, however, comprised different degrees of vestibular involvement considering the evaluation of each single vestibular end-organ with potential different prognosis. Four patients had only deficits of the horizontal and superior semicircular canals or their ampullary nerves. The implementation of C-VEMPs, O-VEMPs and vHIT in a vestibular diagnostic protocol has made possible to observe patients with ampullary VN, unidentifiable with other types of vestibular exams. The effect of age seems to have some impact on the recovery.

Of these 73 cases, 42 involved central diseases and 31 cases involved peripheral diseases. Head shaking nystagmus was observed in 7 subjects of the control group. A highly significant correlation was noted between head shaking nystagmus and positional nystagmus, between head shaking nystagmus and the caloric test and between head shaking nystagmus {{and all the other}} spontaneous types of nystagmus that were investigated (eyes open in light/gaze straight ahead; eyes open behind Frenzel's glasses; eyes closed; eyes open in darkness). No correlation was found between head shaking nystagmus and cervical nystagmus and positioning nystagmus. The sensitivity of head shaking nystagmus, in comparison with other types of spontaneous nystagmus, was found to be slightly higher in cases with peripheral lesions than in those with central lesions.

40|$|Introduction. Panic {{attacks are}} {{characterized}} with sudden attacks of anxiety with numerous somatic symptoms, such as palpitations, tachycardia, tachypnea, nausea, vertigo. The {{objective of this}} study was to analyze symptoms of panic attacks in patients with panic disorder, especially, to determine the specific relationship of somatic and neurological symptoms of panic attacks in boundaries of somatic systems. Material and methods. The study sample consisted of 97 patients with primary diagnosis of panic disorder, without any acute, severe and unstable somatic illness. The presence and frequency of symptoms of panic attacks were estimated by the Panic Disorder Questionnaire. Results. The study results indicate that the most frequent symptoms of panic attacks were cardiological signs (heart pounding or racing) and trembling, followed by unsteady and fainting feeling symptoms, sweating, respiratory symptoms and gastroenterological symptoms. The results of correlation analyses indicate that symptoms of panic attacks classified into cardio-vascular, gastro-enterological, respiratory and <b>neuro-otological</b> systems show statistically significant correlations. Conclusion. The results of analyses of symptoms of panic attacks point to their intercorrelation. This specific association of the symptoms, if they are examined on their own in the patients, could lead to false clinical manifestation of some somatic illness. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze adequately and make the proper differential diagnosis of patients with panic disorder...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dizziness is {{a common}} symptom which is {{frequently}} due to either peripheral or central vestibular dysfunction. However, some patients may lack typical signs suggesting a vestibular or cerebellar lesion and they mostly complain of vertigo or posture imbalance induced by visual stimulation. The symptoms immediately improve either on cessation of the visual input or upon closure of the eyes. Such a presentation is typical of visual vertigo. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1993 to 2003, 242 patients were examined for either "vertigo" or "dizziness". The diagnosis of visual vertigo was based on both history and clinical examination and was present in 11 patients. RESULTS: Visual vertigo was diagnosed in 11 / 242 patients (4. 5 %). Age range was 31 - 77 years (mean 47 years) with a sex ratio of 8 females for 3 males. Neuro-ophthalmological examination was normal in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Visual vertigo is not a rare condition but the disease is underdiagnosed. The symptoms result from a mismatch between vestibular, proprioceptive and visual inputs. Neuro-ophthalmological, neurological and <b>neuro-otological</b> examination are often normal or not relevant and the diagnosis is largely based on history.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundVestibular evoked myogenic {{potentials}} (VEMPs) {{have become}} {{an important part of}} the <b>neuro-otological</b> test battery. They are recorded from averaged electromyography in response to intense auditory stimuli and are used for the assessment of the otolith function. VEMPs have been recorded from tonically contracted cervical muscles and this approach is called ‘‘cervical” VEMPs (cVEMPs). They can also be recorded from extra-ocular muscles in response to loud sound and are termed ‘‘ocular” VEMPs (oVEMPs). The combined VEMPs procedure can be substituted for individual oVEMPs and cVEMPs tests. ObjectivesComparing the results of combined (cVEMPs and oVEMPs) to individual cVEMPs and oVEMPs in healthy subjects. MethodIndividual cVEMPs and oVEMPs then combined (cVEMPs and oVEMPs) are measured and compared with each other in 50 normal healthy adults. ResultscVEMPs have a detectability of 100 % in both individual and combined modes with comparable latency and amplitude. While the detectability of oVEMPs was 94 % in both modes of recordings, with no significant difference as regard latencies or amplitudes. ConclusionBoth oVEMPs and cVEMPs tests can be recorded simultaneously with high degree of accuracy and without affecting results of each other.

However, the pathophysiology of MV {{is still a}} matter of speculation {{and it is not}} known to what extent the dysfunction is located in the central or peripheral vestibular system. The aim of this prospective study was to describe the clinical spectrum of acute MV and to clarify which structures of the vestibular system are involved. Testing of 20 patients with acute MV included <b>neuro-otological</b> examination, recording of spontaneous and positional nystagmus with 3 D video-oculography, and audiometry. Pathological nystagmus was observed in 70 % of patients during acute MV: six had isolated spontaneous nystagmus, five had isolated positional nystagmus and three had a combination of the two. Only a few patients showed additional ocular motor deficits. Imbalance was observed in all patients except one. Hearing was not affected in any patient during the attack. The findings during acute MV point to central– vestibular dysfunction in 10 patients (50 %) and to periph-eral vestibular dysfunction in three patients (15 %). In the remaining seven patients (35 %) the site of involvement could not be determined with certainty. MV should be considered in the differential diagnosis of vertigo with spontaneous and positional nystagmus and can present both as a central and a peripheral vestibular disorder...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dizziness {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{neurological}} symptoms for visiting the emergency department. Acute vertigo and severe imbalance may be the only presenting features of cerebellar stroke that could masquerade as a peripheral vestibular lesion. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) proved to be very sensitive in detecting acute stroke involving brainstem or cerebellum. In this retrospective study, we investigated the diagnostic yield of emergency brain MRI among the patients who visited emergency department with acute dizziness. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of consecutive patients with acute dizziness who were seen in emergency department of Cheju National University Hospital between May 2005 and Oct 2006. We collected following the information from medical records. (1) Age, sex, and blood pressure at emergency department (2) Type, duration, accompanying symptoms of dizziness and positive finding from neurological and <b>neuro-otological</b> examination (3) Vascular risk factors (4) Results of MRIs. Results: During the study period, 360 patients visited emergency department due to isolated acute dizziness. Emergent MRIs were performed in 84 (23. 3 %) patients. Although about 90 % of them were older than 50 years and 60 % of them had at least one or more vascular risk factors, central causes of dizziness were found in only five patients including four acute cerebellar infarctions and a cerebellar hemorrhage. Diagnostic yield of emergent MRI was only 6 %...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackground: Do central {{mechanisms}} {{account for}} the variability of clinical recovery following peripheral vestibulo-cochlear lesions? Objective: To investigate structural (morphological) plasticity in the human brain following unilateral vestibulo-cochlear lesions which might contribute to central vestibular compensation. Methods: We compared regional grey matter volume (GMV) changes in patients after surgical removal of unilateral acoustic neuroma with age-matched control subjects. We hypothesized morphometric changes in the vestibular and auditory cortices which {{may be related to}} functional disability scores. Patients were examined with a battery of <b>neuro-otological</b> tests and clinical scores to assess vestibular and auditory disability. Results: Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used for categorical comparison between patients and age- and gender- matched controls. GMV increase was found bilaterally in primary somatosensory cortices and motion sensitive areas in the medial temporal gyrus (MT). Simple regression analysis revealed GMV increase (i) in the contralesional superior temporal gyrus / posterior insula to be correlated with decreasing clinically assessed vestibular deficits; (ii) in the contralesional inferior parietal lobe with decreasing functional impairment of daily living activities; and (iii) in the contralesional auditory cortex (Heschl gyrus) with decreasing hearing impairment. Conclusions: These data may suggest structural cortical plasticity in multisensory vestibular cortex areas of patients with unilateral peripheral vestibulo-cochlear lesion after surgical removal of acoustic neuroma. As changes of GMV were related to vestibular function structural brain changes may reflect central mechanisms of vestibular compensation...|$|E
40|$|This report {{identifies}} {{fundamental problems}} {{to be addressed in}} order to build relevant clinical tests of human balance while standing. The stated purpose of these tests is identification of lesion site and/or definition of functional balance deficits in a specific patient. During a recent consensus meeting (ESCEBD), 60 researchers and experienced clinical users of posturography (14 European countries, 9 different disciplines) inventoried and critically analyzed the various methodologies of posturography currently used for clinical evaluation. To complement posturography, alternative methods of assessment of balance control were considered. The indications for the clinical use of posturography were defined as well as recommendations regarding measurement parameters, type of perturbations and signal analysis techniques to improve assessment of balance control. Consensus was reached that a force platform cannot be considered as a technique which is sufficient on its own to perform a clinically relevant test for the assessment of <b>neuro-otological</b> and musculo-skeletal conditions, evaluation of compensation or treatment (rehabilitation) or prediction of falls. It should be supported by complementary methods, such as segment motion analysis, body-fixed 2 D or 3 D accelerometer-gyroscope or electromyography. At present, no generally applicable posturography test is available with reasonable sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of balance disorders. Perturbation techniques are most likely needed to enhance the diagnostic yield of posturography. © 2011 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

40|$|An {{audit of}} surgery for {{acoustic}} neuroma {{was carried out}} to determine the frequency and nature of postoperative symptoms and their impact upon the patient's {{quality of life and}} vocation. Fifty-six patients were interviewed between 6 months and 5 years (mean 26 months) after surgical excision of an acoustic neuroma. The objective surgical results in these patients are good, with normal or near normal functional preservation rates of 80 % for the facial nerve (House-Brackmann grade I/II), and 27. 3 % for a previously functioning acoustic nerve. Despite this there was no significant overall reduction in the reported occurrence of balance problems, tinnitus, headache and other neurological sequelae of the tumour after surgical excision. In 20 % of the patients persistent symptoms, including deafness and facial weakness, had prevented the resumption of former social activities. As a result of these symptoms 8. 6 % of the patients were certified medically unfit for work, but of those employed preoperatively over 70 % had returned to their jobs. The success of <b>neuro-otological</b> surgical management of acoustic neuroma is offset by some degree of chronic morbidity. Our patients expressed the need to know whether their symptoms would resolve, but were often too afraid to ask. Patients can be reassured that the majority resume their former social and vocational activities, but should be advised that some symptoms can persist or occur de novo after surgery. Our data suggest that early intervention would reduce the incidence of these troublesome sequelae...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES—Non-acoustic tumours of the cerebellopontine angle {{differ from}} {{vestibular}} schwannomas in their prevalence, clinical features, operative management, and surgical outcome. These features were studied in patients presenting {{to the regional}} <b>neuro-otological</b> unit.  METHODS—A retrospective analysis of clinical notes identified 42 patients with non-acoustic tumours of the cerebellopontine angle. Data were extracted regarding presenting clinical features, histopathological data after surgical resection, surgical morbidity and mortality, and clinical outcome (mean 32 months follow up).  RESULTS—The study group comprised 25 meningiomas (60 %), 12 epidermoid cysts/cholesteatomata (28 %), and five other tumours. In patients with meningiomas, symptoms differed considerably from patients presenting with vestibular schwannomas. Cerebellar signs were present in 52 % and hearing loss in only 68 %. Twenty per cent of patients had hydrocephalus {{at the time of}} diagnosis. After surgical resection, normal facial nerve function was preserved in 75 % of cases. In the epidermoid group, fifth, seventh, and eighth nerve deficits were present in 42 %, 33 %, and 66 % respectively. There were no new postoperative facial palsies. There were two recurrences (17 %) requiring reoperation. Overall, there were two perioperative deaths from pneumonia and meningitis.  CONCLUSIONS—Patients with non-acoustic lesions of the cerebellopontine angle often present with different symptoms and signs from those found in patients with schwannomas. Hearing loss is less prevalent and cerebellar signs and facial paresis are more common as presenting features. Hydrocephalus is often present in patients presenting with cerebellopontine angle meningiomas. Non-acoustic tumours can usually be resected with facial nerve preservation. ...|$|E
