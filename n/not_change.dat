5|$|A 2014 Cochrane review {{found that}} using heparin in medical {{patients}} did <b>not</b> <b>change</b> {{the risk of}} death or pulmonary embolism. While its use decreased people's risks of DVTs, it also increased people's risks of major bleeding. The review thus recommended the need to balance risks and benefits.|$|E
5|$|A third {{possibility}} {{is where the}} primary and moon are tidally locked to each other. In that case, the tidal bulge stays directly under the moon, there is no transfer of angular momentum, and the orbital period will <b>not</b> <b>change.</b> Pluto and Charon are {{an example of this}} type of configuration.|$|E

5|$|Astronomers {{estimate}} that the Solar System {{as we know it}} today will <b>not</b> <b>change</b> drastically until the Sun has fused almost all the hydrogen fuel in its core into helium, beginning its evolution from the main sequence of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram and into its red-giant phase. Even so, the Solar System will continue to evolve until then.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, {{protactinium}} crystallizes in the body-centered tetragonal structure {{which can}} be regarded as distorted body-centered cubic lattice; this structure does <b>not</b> <b>change</b> upon compression up to 53 GPa. The structure changes to face-centered cubic (fcc) upon cooling from high temperature, at about 1200°C. The thermal expansion coefficient of the tetragonal phase between room temperature and 700°C is 9.9/°C.|$|E
5|$|August 13: Kenneth Nichols replaces Marshall {{as head of}} the Manhattan Engineer District. One of {{his first}} tasks as {{district}} engineer is to move the district headquarters to Oak Ridge, although its name did <b>not</b> <b>change.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of the de novo pathway, the salvage reactions are essential in humans; a lack of niacin in the diet causes the vitamin deficiency disease pellagra. This high requirement for NAD results from the constant consumption of the coenzyme in reactions such as posttranslational modifications, since the cycling of NAD between oxidized and reduced forms in redox reactions does <b>not</b> <b>change</b> the overall levels of the coenzyme.|$|E
5|$|Erudite speeches by both Bergh and Quisling {{himself could}} <b>not</b> <b>change</b> the outcome. When {{the verdict was}} {{announced}} on 10 September, Quisling was convicted on {{all but a handful}} of minor charges and sentenced to death.|$|E
5|$|Groves soon {{decided to}} {{establish}} his project headquarters {{on the fifth floor}} of the New War Department Building (now known as the Harry S Truman Building) in Washington, D.C., where Marshall had maintained a liaison office. In August 1943, the MED headquarters (and Nichols, {{who was in charge of}} the production facilities at Hanford and Oak Ridge) moved to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, but the name of the district did <b>not</b> <b>change.</b>|$|E

5|$|He {{showed that}} {{coloured}} light does <b>not</b> <b>change</b> its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and {{that regardless of}} whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour {{is the result of}} objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour.|$|E
5|$|In his {{doctoral}} thesis, Ehlers {{pointed out}} a duality symmetry between different components of the metric of a stationary vacuum spacetime, which maps solutions of Einstein's field equations to other solutions. This symmetry between the tt-component of the metric, which describes time as measured by clocks whose spatial coordinates do <b>not</b> <b>change,</b> and a term known as the twist potential {{is analogous to the}} aforementioned duality between E and B.|$|E
5|$|Mortal Kombat: Deception was {{released}} for the PlayStation 2 (PS2) and Xbox in North America on October 4, 2004, and in PAL territories on November 19, 2004. While {{the game is}} known as Mortal Kombat Mystification in France, other countries did <b>not</b> <b>change</b> its original name. A GameCube version was later released exclusively in North America on March 1, 2005.|$|E

5|$|Numerical {{studies have}} shown that over {{millions}} of years, the general nature of the alignment between the orbits of Pluto and Neptune does <b>not</b> <b>change.</b> There are several other resonances and interactions that enhance Pluto's stability. These arise principally from two additional mechanisms (besides the 2:3 mean-motion resonance).|$|E
5|$|Other {{economists and}} analysts {{have argued that}} the {{underground}} economy would continue to bear the same tax burden as before. They state that replacing the current tax system with a consumption tax would <b>not</b> <b>change</b> the tax revenue generated from the underground economy—while illicit income is not taxed directly, spending of income from illicit activity results in business income and wages that are taxed.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} also an attempt to place the {{relationship}} between the House of Commons and House of Lords on a new footing. As well as the direct issue of money Bills, it set new conventions about how the power the Lords continued to hold would be used. It did <b>not</b> <b>change</b> the composition of the Lords, however.|$|E

The Epistles have been translated, at least partially, into German, French, English, Russian, Polish, Finnish, Italian and Dutch, as shown below.|$|E
5|$|The demands made on Beatrice {{during her}} mother's reign were high. Despite {{suffering}} from rheumatism, Beatrice {{was forced to}} endure her mother's love of cold weather. Beatrice's piano playing suffered as her rheumatism got gradually worse, eliminating an enjoyment in which she excelled; however, this did <b>not</b> <b>change</b> her willingness to cater to her mother's needs. Her effort did not go unnoticed by the British public.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{match was}} between MVP and Kane for the United States Championship. Kane quickly gained control, but MVP had the {{advantage}} after attacking Kane's injured ribs. Kane came back, and targeted MVP's ribs. Kane dominated until MVP rolled outside the ring and was counted out. Kane won the match, and MVP retained his title as a title could <b>not</b> <b>change</b> hands on a countout.|$|E
