40|$|In {{this work}} {{different}} modelling techniques are investigated {{to simulate the}} dynamic behaviour of slender structures on which electrostatic forces are acting. In particular, <b>non-conforming</b> <b>elements</b> are tested to model micro- mechanical devices (or MEMS) having a very large aspect ratio. These elements are constructed on linear shape functions enriched by internal second-order polynomials. As a consequence the element compatibility is not exactly satisfied, but such elements can efficiently model beam- or shell-like structures with {{a small number of}} degrees of freedom. The advantage of <b>non-conforming</b> <b>elements</b> compared to shell or beam elements is that they are volume elements and can therefore easily be combined with other volume finite elements. For micro-mechanical systems the structure must be coupled to the electrostatic domain with the so-called electro-mechanical elements that solve for the electrostatic potential and generate the electrostatic forces. This paper shows that constructing coupled electro-mechanical models for high aspect ratio systems is then greatly simplified when <b>non-conforming</b> finite <b>elements</b> are used. The theory is presented for small deformations and also for large displacements where geometric non-linearities must be accounted for. The elements proposed in this paper are based on non-conforming formulations published earlier. The efficiency of the non-conforming approach combined with specific electro-mechanical elements is highlighted in the analysis of two simple MEMS for which the pull-in voltage is computed.

40|$|Based on the refined <b>non-conforming</b> <b>element</b> method, simple flat {{triangular}} elements {{with standard}} nodal displacement parameters are {{proposed for the}} analysis of shell structures. For ensuring the convergence of the elements a new coupled continuity condition at the inter-element has been established in a weaker form. A common displacement for the inter-element, an explicit expression of refined constant strain matrix, and an adjustable constant are introduced into the formulation, in which the coupled continuity requirement at the inter-element is satisfied in the average sense. The non-conforming displacement function of the well-known triangular plate element BCIZ [1] and the membrane displacement of the constant strain triangular element CST [2] are employed to derive the refined flat shell elements RTS 15, and the refined flat shell elements RTS 18 is derived by using the element BCIZ and the Allman's triangular plane element [3] with the drilling degrees of freedom. A simple reduced higher-order membrane strain matrix is proposed to avoid membrane locking of the element RTS 18. An alternative new reduced higher-order strain matrix method is developed to improve the accuracy of the elements RTS 15 and RTS 18.

40|$|Since its introduction, Topology Optimization (TO) {{has been}} applied to a broad range of design cases. TO is a {{material}} distribution method which finds the optimal material lay-out for a given design space while upholding given constraints and boundary conditions. This has made the method popular in structural mechanics where it is used to find concept designs {{for a wide range of}} structural problems. In this thesis TO will be applied to a structural case inspired by a problem found in ship design: the connections between the hull and the decks as well as the connections between decks. These connections have a significant influence on the behaviour of the ship as they determine the stiffness of the ship. With TO it is possible to find new designs for these connections. Applying TO on these connections is not straightforward as they are a part of a large system, and the interaction with the system must be taken into account for realistic results. This complicates the transformation of the ship response into boundary conditions for the TO model. In this thesis this problem is translated into a general problem where the design region and the global model will be modelled as separate substructures. The Lagrange multiplier method is introduced in this thesis to couple the substructures with non-conforming meshes. Tests in this thesis show the advantages of the method, it is able to couple non-conforming substructures and the error between a coupled highly nonconforming structure (up to 6 times smaller elements between the substructures) and a single structure remains below 1 %. However, the Lagrange multiplier method is not free of disadvantages: it introduces additional unknowns, it makes the system indefinite and gaps and penetrations can be present on the interface due to the weak compatibility, changing the stiffness of the interface. The optimization process is only applied to one substructure. The test results show that the coupling has an effect on the stiffness of the interface, resulting in a different design when the non-conformity between substructures increases. A buffer-zone is introduced in order to exclude the interface elements from the optimization process and this will prevent the influence of coupling on the TO. The designs almost match perfectly with this buffer zone and the differences between the displacements and the compliance of the single structure case is _ 0. 3 %. Using static condensation it is possible to reduce the size of the system resulting in a reduction of the computational cost. The Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) of the global structures, and the Lagrange multipliers are removed, leaving only the DoFs of the substructure that is optimized. This will lead to a system that has the size of the model in the design region and which is unaffected by the size of the systems connected to it. The designs obtained using the condensed systems do not differ from the design obtained using the complete system, while the computational cost per iteration is greatly reduced and made constant. New steps are introduced that will add to the total computational time, such as constructing the condensed stiffness matrices. But these steps only need to be done once and this increase of computational cost is lower than the total reduction obtained. The method has been tested on a problem consisting of 4 substructures with <b>non-conforming</b> <b>element</b> sizes. With the correct buffer-zone the designs found by TO are almost equal and the difference in compliance is low (_ 2. 3 %). The power of static condensation is also shown in this test case, the calculation time of the optimization process is reduced by 40 to 80 %. Concluding that a design region can be coupled as a substructure to an existing model and optimized without substantially increasing the computational cost.

40|$|Generalizing the {{approach}} of a previous work [15] the authors present multilevel preconditioners for three-dimensional (3 D) elliptic problems discretized by a family of Rannacher Turek <b>non-conforming</b> finite <b>elements.</b> Preconditioners based on various multilevel extensions of two-level finite element methods (FEM) lead to iterative methods which often have an optimal order computational complexity {{with respect to the}} number of degrees of freedom of the system.

40|$|AbstractFor the {{iterative}} {{solution of}} linear systems of equations arising from finite element discretization of elliptic problems there exist well-established techniques to construct numerically efficient and computationally optimal preconditioners. Among those, most often preferred choices are Multigrid methods (geometric or algebraic), Algebraic MultiLevel Iteration (AMLI) methods, Domain Decomposition techniques. In this work, the method in focus is AMLI. We extend its construction {{and the underlying}} theory over to systems arising from discretizations of parabolic problems, using <b>non-conforming</b> finite <b>element</b> methods (FEM). The AMLI method {{is based on an}} approximated block two-by-two factorization of the original system matrix. A key ingredient for the efficiency of the AMLI preconditioners is the quality of the utilized block two-by-two splitting, quantified by the so-called Cauchy–Bunyakowski–Schwarz (CBS) constant, which measures the abstract angle between the two subspaces, associated with the two-by-two block splitting of the matrix. The particular choice of space discretization for the parabolic equations, used in this paper, is Crouzeix–Raviart <b>non-conforming</b> <b>elements</b> on triangular meshes.
