A Probit model estimated over a cross-section of Indian manufacturing firms for 2003, indicates that bankers on boards seem to exert a healthy impact on the companies. In fact, large public limited companies are likely to exhibit banker representation, primarily in their role as expertise providers. The evidence from Tobit model reconfirms these results. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{board of}} {{directors}} {{plays an important role}} in solving the agency problem between shareholders and management. This paper investigates the relationships between ownership and board structure with the diversification strategy of large Japanese firms. The results show that corporate <b>nominee</b> <b>directors</b> are associated with lower levels of product diversification of their investee firms. This suggests that <b>nominee</b> <b>directors</b> in large Japanese corporations see themselves representing specific interests and therefore investors should pay attention to board composition in order to assess the level of protection they can expect to receive. Even without any apparent agency problem with management, there remains a potential "principal-principal" problem. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005. ...|$|R

40|$|The term {{corporate}} governance {{has been defined}} in the broad sense and is {{also referred to as}} the process through which shareholders induce management to act in their interest A <b>nominee</b> <b>director</b> is usually appointed by the nominators to sit {{on the board of directors}} of a company to represent their interests. These nominators are usually the major shareholders or a class of shareholders or the creditors. Nominee directors are commonly found in companies such as in corporate groups, joint ventures and government-linked companies. It is a trite law that the board of directors act in the best interest of the company. A <b>nominee</b> <b>director,</b> in discharging his or her duties to the company will face the dual loyalty. Firstly is his or her loyalty to the nominators who have nominated him or her to represent their interest in the company. Secondly is the <b>nominee</b> <b>director</b> s duty to the company. Hence, the <b>nominee</b> <b>director</b> is in a delicate position in discharging his or her duty. Section 132 (1 E) of the Malaysian Companies Act 1965, stipulates the position of the <b>nominee</b> <b>director</b> under the strict approach that is to act in the best interest of the company and shall not subordinate the interest of the company to his or her nominators. Malaysian corporate ownership is in the concentrated category and the position of nominee directors is common. Companies in Malaysia are required to adhere to the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance 2012. This paper aims to provide clearly the position of the <b>nominee</b> <b>director</b> as the gatekeeper and will assist the corporate regulators to improve and promote good {{corporate governance}} practice in the Malaysian corporate landscape...|$|E
