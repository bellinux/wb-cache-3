40|$|Because {{of their}} highly {{developed}} skills, {{major league baseball}} players generate significant economic rents. According to the 'weak version' of the Coase theorem, the allocation of these players is independent of who controls the rights to these rents, which depends on the rules governing competition in the baseball labour market. The rules of Major League Baseball establish a dual system. For senior players the market is competitive, and players have the right of 'free agency,' allowing them to attempt to contract with the team of their choice; for players with fewer years of experience the market is monopsonistic, and a player's right to play baseball is owned by his current team. Consequently, we simultaneously observe two different allocations of property rights. Using individual player data for 1979 and 1980 we test whether baseball player movement is independent of the ownership of these rents. We estimate the wage (marginal revenue) determination process for free-agent and non free agent movers and non-movers. This permits us to generate expected gains from a move for both free-agent <b>eligible</b> and <b>non</b> free-agent <b>eligible</b> players. Coase's theorem is tested by determining if both player types, and, hence, player allocation, are equally responsive to gains from migration. ...|$|R
40|$|Failure {{detection}} protocols—an important {{building block}} of fault-tolerant distributed systems—are often de-scribed by their authors {{making use of}} informal pseudo-codes of their own devising. Often these pseudo-codes use syntactical constructs that are not available in COTS pro-gramming languages such as C or C++.

40|$|BackgroundExtracorporeal {{life support}} (ECLS) {{provides}} mechanical cardiopulmonary support {{and has been}} used for intractable heart failure as a bridge to heart transplantation or to recovery. Intractable arrhythmic storm is associated with high mortality. Little is known about the effectiveness of ECLS to treat refractory ventricular arrhythmias responsible for cardiogenic shock in patients <b>non</b> <b>eligible</b> for an urgent ablation. MethodsPatients with intractable refractory ventricular arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock despite optimal medical therapy, and treated by ECLS implantation were retrospectively included. Patients’ characteristics and outcome were analyzed. Results 20 patients (53 ± 10 yo) were included. The underlying etiology to the refractory ventricular storm was ischemic cardiomyopathy (75 %), short coupled Torsades de Pointes (10 %), dilated cardiomyopathy (5 %), myocarditis (5 %) or unknown (5 %). Mean LVEF was 33 ± 17 %. An average of 2. 3 ± 1. 2 anti-arrhythmic drugs was tried before implantation. Arrhythmic storm stopped after a median time of 15 min after ECLS implantation. 8 patients (40 %) eventually died, none of them because of a complication of ECLS implantation. The remaining 12 patients (60 %) had ECLS withdrawn after a median time of 5. 3 days, and were discharged after a median time of 29 days after admission (survival curve in the figure). ConclusionThis is the largest database of patients temporary implanted with ECLS for refractory ventricular arrhythmia responsible for cardiogenic shock and <b>non</b> <b>eligible</b> for ablation. It provides efficient hemodynamic support to these critically ill patients, and survival rate after the implantation is 60 %. Figure: Survival curv...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{a natural}} {{experiment}} {{that took place}} in Ecuador {{in the context of a}} capital outflow tax, this paper presents suggestive evidence of the emergence of an abnormal transfer pricing behavior. We exploit the fact that some imports were eligible to a tax-credit measure aiming to offset the capital outflow tax. The identification strategy relies on the fact that a foreign multinational enterprise has only an incentive to increase the unit value -transfer price- for profit shifting motivations of products eligible to the tax-credit. Then, comparing the evolution of the unit value of eligible products (the treatment group) with that of <b>non</b> <b>eligible</b> products (the comparison group) before and after the tax-credit measure, we estimate the over-reporting incentive's impact on the reported value. Results show that the declared unit value of eligible imports increased following the introduction of the tax-credit measure. Various tests suggest that this abnormal increase is attributable to a profit-shifting behavior...|$|E
40|$|Background: An opportune, {{efficient}} and low cost medical {{attention should be}} provided to all patients, without discrimination. When the need for medical attention outweighs the available resources, permanently increasing waiting lists are generated. The aim of the Universal Access and Explicit Guaranties Plan (AUGE) is to attend selected patients in periods predefined by the health authority. Aim: To describe {{the first six months}} of implementation of AUGE plan for chronic renal failure in a public hospital of Santiago. Material and methods: As a health care quality monitoring system, the lapse between the generation of a nephrological consultation and the specialist assessment, is registered periodically. These lapses were evaluated before and after the AUGE plan implementation, for eligible and <b>non</b> <b>eligible</b> patients for the plan. Results were modeled according queue theory. Results: After three months of implementation, the AUGE plan prolongs waiting periods and increases the number of all patients seeking for nephrological attention. Conclusions: According to these results AUGE plan will be successful only if its present functioning is modified and receives more financial resources (Rev Méd Chile 2003; 131 : 545 - 51) ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To assess English-speaking reviewers' {{accuracy}} {{in determining the}} eligibility of foreign-language articles for a systematic review. Study Design and Settings: Systematic review of randomized controlled trials of therapy for fibromyalgia. Guided by 10 questions, English-speaking reviewers screened non English-language articles for eligibility. Teams of two native-language speakers provided reference standard judgments of eligibility. Results: Of 15, 466 potentially eligible articles, we retrieved 763 in full text, of which 133 were published in 19 non-English languages; 53 trials published in 11 languages other than English proved eligible. Of the 53 eligible articles, English-language reviewers guided by the 10 questions mistakenly judged 6 as ineligible; of the 80 ineligible articles, 8 were incorrectly judged eligible by English-language reviewers (sensitivity = 0. 89; specificity = 0. 90). Use of a simple three-step rule (excluding languages with less than three articles, reviewing titles and abstracts for clear indications of eligibility, and noting {{the lack of a}} clearly reported statistical analysis unless the word "random" appears) led to accurate classification of 51 of 53 articles (sensitivity = 0. 96; specificity = 0. 70). Conclusion: Our findings show promise for limiting the need for non English-language review teams in systematic reviews with large numbers of potentially <b>eligible</b> <b>non</b> English-language articles.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the developmental climb of students at one large Midwestern community college based on their Assessment and Learning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS) placement scores in remedial mathematics. Specifically, the purpose of this research study was to assess and explore the predictors of student progression and their progression rates in remedial math at this college. Remediation is important because of the nature of the community college with its open access that attracts underprepared students. Further, community colleges are growing in popularity and are often used as a stepping stone for students who may be underprepared to enter four-year institutions. The conceptual framework used for this investigation of remedial students at one community college was the Developmental Climb of Hagedorn, Lester, and Cypres (2010), who focused on the nature of remedial/developmental courses and the difficulty of progression through the sequence to college-level math. This study examined 2, 172 students’ transcript data and demographic information from a secondary data source at one Midwestern community college. The data set was followed for four consecutive terms starting in Fall 2015 and ending in Fall 2016. Using quantitative research analysis, including descriptive analysis and logistic regression, the researcher hypothesized which factors contributed to the students’ remedial math progression to college-level math. The results indicated that there is a slight demographic difference in this community college sample compared to community college students nationally. This college is trending toward more of a four-year institution population where the majority are White, female, <b>non</b> Pell grant <b>eligible,</b> and of a traditional college age (18 - 22). A significant difference lies in the fact that over 50 % of the students were placed in remedial math per their college-mandated ALEKS score. Of those, more non White females and nontraditional aged students were placed in remedial math compared to students placed in college-level math. Additionally, progression rates for the remedial students were identified showing that many did not complete the full sequence of courses in developmental math, nor did most remedial students reach college-level math. Utilizing logistic regression, the progression model for the remedial students showed that race, gender, and academic standing were predictors of student progression in remedial math. The logistic model for college-level progression found that the ALEKS score, math grades, and good academic standing were predictors of student progression to college-level math. The findings generated implications for policymakers, administrators, faculty, and students. Depending on the stakeholder, remedial math can look very different. To the policymaker and administrator, these findings can indicate a serious problem in completion and enrollment. For the faculty member, the classroom is more likely filled with similarly skilled students who may or may not do well. And for the student, remedial math can pose either the opportunity to achieve college-level math or failure to because of the barriers of limited time and financial resources. According to this study, community college students are not progressing in remedial math at high rates; therefore, each stakeholder has specific decisions to make as to their approach to it...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: In October 2009 the French National Authority for Health {{recommended}} that HIV testing be proposed {{at least once}} to all persons aged 15 to 70 years in all healthcare settings. We examined whether routine HIV screening with a rapid test in emergency departments (EDs) was feasible without dedicated staff, and whether newly diagnosed persons could be linked to care. METHODS: This one-year study started in December 2009 in 6 EDs in the Paris area, using the INSTI™ test. Eligible individuals were persons 18 to 70 years old who did not present for a vital emergency, for blood or sexual HIV exposure, or for HIV screening. Written informed consent was required. RESULTS: Among 183 957 eligible persons, 11 401 were offered HIV testing (6. 2 %), of whom 7936 accepted (69. 6 %) and 7215 (90. 9 %) were tested (overall screening rate 3. 9 %); 1857 <b>non</b> <b>eligible</b> persons were also tested. Fifty-five new diagnoses of HIV infection were confirmed by Western blot (0. 61 % (95 % CI 0. 46 - 0. 79). There was one false-positive rapid test result. Among the newly diagnosed persons, 48 (87 %) were linked to care, of whom 36 were not lost to follow-up at month 6 (75 %); median CD 4 cell count was 241 /mm(3) (IQR: 52 - 423 /mm(3)). CONCLUSIONS: Screening rates {{were similar to those}} reported in opt-in studies with no dedicated staff. The rate of new diagnoses was similar to that observed in free anonymous test centres in the Paris area, and well above the prevalence (0. 1 %) at which testing {{has been shown to be}} cost-effective...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundPremature {{discontinuation}} of antiplatelet {{therapy is}} a major risk factor of stent thrombosis after drug-eluting stent placement leading to {{an increased risk of}} death. ObjectivesWe sought to determine by a simple questionnaire the prevalence of patients at risk for premature discontinuation of oral antiplatelet therapy in elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). MethodsPatients scheduled for elective PCI underwent a routine interview (RI) and a specific questionnaire (SQ) by two independent physicians the day before the intervention. The SQ was designed to identify bleeding disorders, suspected cancer, planned invasive procedures and self evaluation of compliance. The final decision of drug eluting stent (DES) implantation was made by a third independent physician who performed the planned PCI and who had full access to the patient record. ResultsAt least one contraindication to DES implantation was found in one third of the study population (82 / 302, 27 %) after the RI. All these patients were also identified by the SQ. At total of 31 additional patients were identified by the SQ as <b>non</b> <b>eligible</b> for DES implantation. Active bleeding (n = 14) and scheduled biopsies (n = 4) were the two main contraindications to DES implantation isolated by the SQ. Patients characteristics and angiographic findings identified 59. 9 % patients (n = 181 / 302) eligible for a DES implantation. Finally the physician performing the PCI excluded 66. 3 % of the patients (n = 79 / 302) who could receive a DES and implanted a bare metal stent (BMS) instead. This decision was based on the findings of the dedicated questionnaire on top of the interview in 30 patients (38 %) and in 49 patients (62 %) for other reasons. ConclusionsIn elective PCI, a simple questionnaire used before DES implantation can improve identification of patients at high risk for premature discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackground: Access {{to health}} care is a global public problem. In French Guiana, there exists social inequalities which are {{specially}} marked amongst immigrants who make up a third of the population. Health care inequalities are prevalent. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine factors associated with why health care amongst the poor population of Cayenne was renounced. Study design The study was cross sectional. It focused on knowledge, attitudes, practices and beliefs of the population living in poor neighborhoods of the Cayenne area. Methods: Populations coming at the Red Cross mobile screening unit in poor urban areas of Cayenne were surveyed from July 2013 to June 2014. Structured questionnaires consisted of 93 questions. Written informed consent was requested at the beginning of the questionnaire. The predictors for renouncing medical care were determined using logistic regression models and tree analysis. Results: Twenty percent of persons had renounced care. Logistic regression showed that renouncement of health care was negatively associated with having no regular physician Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 0. 43 (95 %CI= 0. 24 - 0. 79) and positively associated with being embarrassed to ask certain questions AOR= 6. 81 (95 %CI= 3. 98 - 11. 65) and having been previously refused health care by a doctor AOR= 3. 08 (95 %CI= 1. 43 - 6. 65). Tree analysis also showed that three of these variables were linked to renouncement, with feeling shy to ask certain questions as the first branching. Conclusion: Although most people felt it was easy to see a doctor, one in five had renounced health care. The variables identified by the models suggest vulnerable persons generally had previous negative encounters with the health system and felt unwanted or <b>non</b> <b>eligible</b> for healthcare. Health care mediation and welcoming staff may be simple solutions to the above problems which were underscored in our observations...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{description}} of the follow up {{during the first year of}} 706 consecutive patients admitted at from the coronary care unit of the Thoraxcenter with a proven diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction between March 1981 and December 1983. The main aim, outlined in this chapter, was to assess the relative value of the usual clinical variables compared to that of multiple noninvasive tests at discharge to predict survival after hospital discharge • In chapter 2 we addressed the problem of comparing clinical variables and predischarge bicycle ergometry results to predict mortality and other non-fatal events during follow up. Patients judged <b>non</b> <b>eligible</b> for stress test were separately analyzed. In chapter 3 we assessed the relative merits of clinical data, bicycle ergomet. ry, radionuclide ventriculography and 24 -hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring to predict one year survival. Since the 12 -lead electrocardiogram is always performed at discharge and since there has recently been renewed interest in the prognostic value of the electrocardiogram in post-infarction patients, we studied in chapter 4 the prognostic value of different variables derived from the electrocardiogram. In particular the risk estimation compared to that obtained from other clinical variables was analyzed. In chapter 5 the follow up is described during the first year of patients with a first myocardial infarction, in terms of their peak serum creatine phosphokinase. The rationale for that analysis was to test whether patients with a small initial infarct were subject to more or fewer ischemic events during follow-up, compared to those with intermediate or large size infarctions. The prognosis of patients below 60 years who survived the hospital phase of a first myocardial infarction with an uncomplicated clinical course, was investigated in Chapter 6. Here the role of exercise testing in guiding the decision to proceed with coronary angiography formed the main study object...|$|E
