He did <b>not</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> steal very often but used his speed to take extra bases. Between 1916 and 1927 Hornsby had 30inside-the-park home runs, and he led the league with 17triples in 1917 and 18triples in 1921; he had 20triples in 1920.|$|E

The radio station does <b>not</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> duplicate C-SPAN television coverage, and takes a more selective approach to its broadcast content.

5|$|JC's Girls (short for Jesus Christ's Girls, {{also called}} the JC's Girls Girls Girls Ministry) is an Evangelical Christian women's {{organization}} in the United States whose members evangelize to female workers in the sex industry. The organization supports women wishing to leave the industry, but does <b>not</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> persuade them to do so. The group does not focus upon conversion but rather on communicating its message that Christians exist who are not judging female sex workers {{and are willing to}} accept them. The organization also helps both women and men seeking to overcome pornography addiction.|$|E

The expedition was to retake Louisbourg and then Annapolis Royal.

5|$|The strike {{heightened}} public fear {{of labor}} unrest {{and the possible}} radicalism that lay behind it. It contributed to the public anxiety of the period known as the Red Scare of 1919–1920. The failure of this and other strikes {{in the years following}} World War I contributed to declining union membership in subsequent years. The American Federation of Labor responded to political pressure experienced during the strike and revoked the charters it had granted to police unions. That ended police unionism in the U.S. for two decades, as police would <b>not</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> organize until World War II.|$|E

Voss riddled Cronyn's SE.5 from close range, putting {{him out of the}} dogfight. Cronyn had to turn in under his attacker and throw his aircraft into a spin to escape being killed.

5|$|About 1,500 {{members of}} the Front for the National Liberation of the Congo (FNLC) invaded Shaba Province (modern-day Katanga Province) in Zaire from eastern Angola on 7 March 1977. The FNLC wanted to {{overthrow}} Mobutu, and the MPLA government, suffering from Mobutu's support for the FNLA and UNITA, did <b>not</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> stop the invasion. The FNLC failed to capture Kolwezi, Zaire's economic heartland, but took Kasaji and Mutshatsha. The Zairean army (the Forces Armées Zaïroises) was defeated without difficulty and the FNLC continued to advance. On 2 April, Mobutu appealed to William Eteki of Cameroon, Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, for assistance. Eight days later, the French government responded to Mobutu's plea and airlifted 1,500 Moroccan troops into Kinshasa. This force worked {{in conjunction with the}} Zairean army, the FNLA and Egyptian pilots flying French-made Zairean Mirage fighter aircraft to beat back the FNLC. The counter-invasion force pushed the last of the militants, along with numerous refugees, into Angola and Zambia in April 1977.|$|E
5|$|According to Skeat {{the note}} in the codex {{indicated}} that the manuscript had not previously been in the Patriarchal Library in Alexandria. The manuscript was carried from Constantinople to Alexandria between 1308 and 1316, together with two mentioned above manuscripts of Chrysostom. It remained in Alexandria until 1621, when Cyril removed it once to Constantinople. Whether was originally written, in Constantinople or in Alexandria, is another question. Skeat did <b>not</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> give the answer on this question ("if any future scholar wisches to claim a Constantinopolitan origin for the Codex Alexandrinus, {{it is at least}} open to him to do so"). This view was supported by McKendrick, who proposes Ephesian provenance of the codex.|$|E

Roy encourages Pam to pursue her feelings for Jim {{but she says she}} will <b>not</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get him. Roy does not understand his long-time fiancée, especially her choice to not pursue Jim.|$|E

Paulo either resents or is indifferent toward the often heroic actions {{of some of the}} survivors, spending much of his time golfing. He complains to Nikki about not being included; however, he does little to help out around the camp and does <b>not</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> improve his status in the survivors' hierarchy. When he does get chances to participate in treks, for example, when Hurley finds a car, Paulo is uninterested and discourages Nikki from joining Hurley on his adventure. Nikki tries to participate, tending to a wounded Mr. Eko and volunteering to go with Locke to the Pearl station, much to the surprise of Paulo. Paulo accompanies her, and he exhibits a constant sarcastic behavior in the Pearl.|$|E
5|$|The AFIS air {{controller}} has {{a different}} role in Norway than in Russia, and the crew were not aware {{that they were being}} given information and advice, rather than orders. Communication with AFIS was left with the navigator, which is a breach of norms. Communication between air control and the crew was problematic, since the crew lacked sufficient English skills. The pilot in command had insufficient crew resource management. After the crew decided to carry out the approach to Runway 28, a new approach briefing was not accomplished. The aircraft overshot the approach centerline when turning inbound, because they did <b>not</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> intercept the outbound track from Advent. The crew showed a lack of situational awareness following their uncertainty of the aircraft position in relation to LLZ 28, caused by indications on the HSIs.|$|E
5|$|The largely free {{elections}} of 1950 were {{won by the}} popular Árbenz, and represented the first transfer of power between democratically elected leaders in Guatemala. Árbenz had personal ties to {{some members of the}} communist PGT, which was legalized during his government, and a couple of members played a role in drafting the new president's policies. Nonetheless, Árbenz did <b>not</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> turn Guatemala into a communist state, instead choosing a moderate capitalist approach. The PGT too committed itself to working within the existing legal framework to achieve its immediate objectives of emancipating peasants from feudalism and improving workers' rights. The most prominent component of Árbenz's policy was his agrarian reform bill. Árbenz drafted the bill himself, having sought advice from economists across Latin America. The focus of the law was on transferring uncultivated land from large landowners to poor laborers, who would then be able to begin viable farms of their own.|$|E

Both the Americans and the South Vietnamese lodged complaints to the International Control Commission about the violations of the Geneva Accords, but little action was taken. According to B. S. M.

5|$|This {{variation}} {{is named after}} Alekhine thanks to his wins in the games Alekhine–Rabinovic (Baden Baden, 1925) and Alekhine–Seitz (Hastings, 1926). White does <b>not</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> keep its material advantage (the e5-pawn) and concentrates on establishing a strong pawn center and space advantage. A controversial point is whether the typical black manoeuvre Bf8–b4–xc3 is advantageous for Black (as it saddles White with doubled pawns) or for White (as it reinforces his centre). Lalic thinks both, considering 6...Bb4+ {{to be a bad}} move after 4...Nxe5 5.f4 Nec6 6.Nf3, but a good one after 4...Nxe5 5.f4Nec6 6.Be3. After 4.e4 the main line is 4...Nxe55.f4 when Black has an important choice to make about where to move the Ne5. The retreat to the queenside with 5...Nec6 is considered best, while the retreat to the kingside with 5...Ng6 is probably playable.|$|E
5|$|Though these {{measures}} were established to counter {{many of the}} irrationalities in the Soviet economic system, the reform did <b>not</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> change the existing system radically; it instead tried to improve it gradually. Success was ultimately mixed, and Soviet analyses on why the reform failed to reach its full potential have never given any definitive answers. The key factors are agreed upon, however, with blame being put on {{the combination of the}} recentralisation of the economy with the decentralisation of enterprise autonomy, creating several administrative obstacles. Additionally, instead of creating a market which in turn would establish a pricing system, administrators were given the responsibility for overhauling the pricing system themselves. Because of this, the market-like system failed to materialise. To make matters worse, the reform was contradictory at best. In retrospect, however, the Eighth Five-Year Plan as a whole is considered {{to be one of the}} most successful periods for the Soviet economy, and the most successful for consumer production.|$|E
