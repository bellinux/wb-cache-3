5|$|Losses on {{the ground}} {{amounted}} to eight fighters (two Spitfires). Around 28 aircraft of other types were destroyed {{on the ground}}. The total destroyed or damaged beyond repair amounted to 68 aircraft, although 17 of these were trainers or <b>non-operational</b> types.|$|E
5|$|Olds was {{promoted}} to brigadier general after returning from Vietnam but did not hold another major command. The remainder of his career was spent in <b>non-operational</b> positions, as Commandant of Cadets at the United States Air Force Academy and as an official in the Air Force Inspector General's Office. His inability to rise higher as a general officer is attributed to both his maverick views and his penchant for drinking.|$|E
5|$|Attempting to {{list the}} {{equipment}} available to the DRC's land forces is difficult; most figures are unreliable estimates based on known items delivered in the past. The IISS's Military Balance 2007 and Orbat.com's Concise World Armies 2005 give only slightly differing figures however (the figures below are from the IISS Military Balance 2007). Much of the Army's equipment is <b>non-operational</b> due to insufficient maintenance—in 2002 only 20 percent of the Army's armoured vehicles were estimated as being serviceable.|$|E
5|$|He {{joined the}} Royal Canadian Air Force in 1939 as a flight lieutenant, {{completed}} an advanced course and served until mid-1941 as instructor of British Commonwealth Air Training Plan instructors. After {{a short period}} in England at a glider and paratrooper training center, he was posted to No. 405 Squadron RCAF. On returning in difficult weather conditions after bombing Berlin with the squadron {{on the night of}} November 7, 1941, he was forced to land his aircraft on a <b>non-operational</b> airfield, and as a result was temporarily suspected of being a spy by the Home Guard.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the {{fighting}} the Australian Army sustained approximately 61,000 battle casualties, the bulk of them from the Second AIF. This included 11,323 killed in action, 1,794 died of wounds, and 21,853 wounded. 5,558 were killed or died in captivity, while another 20,920 survived as prisoners of war. Non-battle casualties included 1,088 killed and 33,196 wounded/injured in operational areas, and another 1,795 killed and 121,800 wounded/injured in <b>non-operational</b> areas. The large number of non-battle casualties was significant, illustrating the toll that sickness and disease took upon the Army.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June 1941, most MiG-1s and MiG-3s were in {{the border}} {{military}} districts of the Soviet Union. The Leningrad Military District had 164, 135 {{were in the}} Baltic Military District, 233 in the Western Special Military District, 190 in the Kiev Military District and 195 in the Odessa Military District {{for a total of}} 917 on hand, of which only 81 were <b>non-operational.</b> An additional 64 MiGs were assigned to Naval Aviation, 38 in the Air Force of the Baltic Fleet and 26 in the Air Force of the Black Sea Fleet.|$|E
5|$|This {{prompted}} a {{transfer to a}} landing ground at Semallé, south-east of Alençon. As the unit was establishing itself here, they came under fresh attack from Mustangs, which shot up the airfield, destroying 15 Fw 190s and putting II./JG 1 out of the battle. Around 11 <b>non-operational</b> Fw 190s were also destroyed– resulting in the final losses of II./JG 1 in Normandy. In ten weeks in Normandy, II./JG 1 had lost 27 pilots, 3 captured and 2 wounded. A total of 106 aircraft were lost for various reasons.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the force}} was {{commanded}} by its commissioner, {{there was also}} an influential senior post of comptroller, created in 1880 in response to Macleod's financial mismanagement of the force. For most of the force's history the role was occupied by Frederick White, until replaced by A. A. Mclean in 1913. The comptroller was responsible for keeping account of expenditure, auditing and managing procurement, and effectively removed most of the <b>non-operational</b> functions from the commissioner's responsibility. White was a political client of Prime Minister John Macdonald, who took a close interest in the management of the force, and the post became critical for garnering support from Ottawa for investment in the police.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Northcott was {{attached}} to the British 7th Armoured Division in the Middle East to study armoured warfare, returning to Australia in December 1941 to organise the new 1st Armoured Division. In March 1942, he assumed command II Corps. In September 1942, he was appointed Chief of the General Staff. As General Sir Thomas Blamey's principal <b>non-operational</b> subordinate, he was responsible for administering and training the wartime army. After the war, he served as commander of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in the post-war Occupation of Japan. He retired from the Army in 1946 to become the Governor of New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|No.114 MFCU {{was rapidly}} reduced in size {{following}} {{the end of}} the war. It departed Tarakan for Australia on 3December 1945 with No.78 Wing, arriving at RAAF Station Deniliquin, New South Wales, on the 14th. Still under the wing's control, it relocated to RAAF Station Schofields on 31May and then to RAAF Station Williamtown on 1August, disbanding on 1April 1948. No.114 MFCU was re-established under a newly organised No.78 Wing on 24January 1949—"in name only", however, as it remained <b>non-operational.</b> It began training in late 1955 prior to anticipated reactivation, and was renamed No.114 Mobile Control and Reporting Unit (MCRU) on 12March 1956. It relocated to RAAF Dubbo and stood up as an independent unit on 14November.|$|E
5|$|Although operationally {{placed at}} the {{disposal}} of the British, the AIF was administered as a separate national force, with the Australian government reserving the responsibility for the promotion, pay, clothing, equipment and feeding of its personnel. The AIF was administered separately from the home-based army in Australia, and a parallel system was set up to deal with <b>non-operational</b> matters including record-keeping, finance, ordnance, personnel, quartermaster and other issues. The AIF also had separate conditions of service, rules regarding promotion and seniority, and graduation list for officers. This responsibility initially fell to Bridges, in addition to his duties as its commander; however, an Administrative Headquarters was later set up in Cairo in Egypt. Following the redeployment of the Australian infantry divisions to the Western Front it was relocated to London. Additional responsibilities included liaison with the British War Office as well as the Australian Department of Defence in Melbourne, whilst also being tasked with the command of all Australian troops in Britain. A training headquarters was also established at Salisbury.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, some major units were disbanded {{and a lot}} of {{equipment}} was phased out or scrapped due to a severe shortage of funds. The whole land forces structure was reorganized from armies into territorial corps, and from regiments into battalions. In the mid-1990s, the situation of the land forces was critical: the military budget was three times lower than in 1989 (636 million dollars), 50% of the equipment was older than 30 years, and 60% of the armoured vehicles and 85% of the missile units were <b>non-operational.</b> Due to lack of fuel and training, the level of combat readiness and military capability was extremely low (only about 30% of the entire land forces were operational). However, after 1996 the government took serious action; the military budget was increased greatly, and modernisation of equipment commenced. Officially, the program to modernize and restructure the armed forces began on 11 April 2000.|$|E
5|$|No.86 Squadron {{departed}} Merauke on 25April 1944; {{the squadron}} was subsequently {{reduced to a}} cadre and its Kittyhawks transferred to Nos.78 and 81 Wings of No.10 Operational Group on Noemfoor Island. It {{was replaced by the}} Dutch-Australian No.120 Squadron, which arrived from Canberra in early May and became operational on the 9th of the month. The same month, Walters handed over command of the wing to Group Captain Bill Hely. In July, No.12 Squadron was withdrawn to Strathpine, Queensland, where it was reduced to cadre status ahead of converting to B-24 Liberator heavy bombers and eventually serving with another new formation, No.85 Wing. Hely departed in September 1944 to establish an army cooperation formation, No.84 Wing, at Cairns. Most of the RAAF units at Merauke were redeployed in late 1944 but No.120 Squadron remained there until February 1945, when it was declared <b>non-operational.</b> The squadron returned to operational status and departed for eventual service at Biak in April that year. No.72 Wing headquarters returned to Townsville in May 1945, disbanding on 20June.|$|E
5|$|On 11March 1944, No.84 Squadron was hurriedly redeployed to North-Western Area {{to replace}} the Supermarine Spitfires of No.1 Wing, which had been {{despatched}} to Perth {{in response to a}} feared Japanese naval attack. No attack took place, and No.84 Squadron returned to Horn Island less than two weeks later. On 17May, the squadron departed Horn Island for Townsville, and was subsequently reduced to cadre. No.7 Squadron continued operations in the Dutch East Indies from Higgins, generally in conjunction with other forces such as B-25 Mitchells from North-Western Area, before its tasking was reduced in August pending transfer to No.71 Wing in New Guinea. No.23 Squadron was equipped with A-31 Vengeance dive bombers and undertook army-cooperation duties out of Higgins until being declared <b>non-operational</b> in June. That month, a squadron leader from North-Eastern Area Command arrived at No.75 Wing headquarters to investigate Vengeance accidents and unserviceability; on departure his Vengeance crash-landed on the beach at Princess Charlotte Bay and the crew had to be rescued by an aircraft of No.9 Squadron. No.23 Squadron was subsequently re-equipped with B-24 Liberator heavy bombers and transferred to North-Western Area.|$|E
5|$|With the Allies' {{decision}} to confine RAAF minelaying operations to areas south of China from June onwards, {{the number of}} worthwhile targets for the Catalinas was reduced. Sorties for the month were down to 58, a number of which were carried out from Labuan against Banka Strait. The wing's last minelaying missions of the war took place in July, again in the Banka Strait. In the final months before the Japanese surrender, the Catalinas also delivered propaganda leaflets around the Dutch East Indies and South China Sea, dropping over a million in June alone. No.76 Wing and its squadrons remained at Darwin {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the war, conducting routine patrols, transporting supplies and medicine to prisoners-of-war in the South West Pacific, and assisting in the repatriation of Australian personnel. In November 1945, under a reorganisation of RAAF units at Darwin, the wing headquarters was given orders to disband. It became <b>non-operational</b> on 16November and was officially dissolved five days later. No.42 Squadron disbanded the same month, while Nos.20 and 43 Squadrons transferred to Rathmines, where they disbanded in 1946.|$|E

A training headquarters was also established at Salisbury. The AIF Headquarters and its subordinate units were almost entirely independent from the British Army, which allowed the force to be self-sustaining in many fields. The AIF generally followed British administrative policy and procedures, including for the awarding of imperial honours and awards.|$|E
5|$|The {{demands of}} combat during World War II led {{to changes in}} the {{composition}} of Army units. The success of German mechanised units during the invasions of Poland and France convinced Australian defence planners that the Army required armoured units, and these began to be raised in 1941. These units were not suitable for jungle warfare, however, and most were disbanded during 1943 and 1944. Conditions in the South West Pacific also led the Army to convert its six combat divisions to jungle divisions in early 1943 and 1944 with fewer heavy weapons and vehicles. This organisation proved only moderately successful, and the divisions were strengthened for their 1944–45 campaigns. The process of demobilisation began immediately after the end of hostilities in August 1945 and was finally completed on 15 February 1947. A total of 730,000 personnel enlisted in the Australian Army during the war, a figure which represented around 10 percent of the population. Nearly 400,000 men ultimately served overseas, with 40 percent of the total force serving in front line areas. As a proportion of its population, the Australian Army was ultimately one of the largest Allied armies during World War II. Casualties included 11,323 killed in action, 1,794 who died of wounds, and 21,853 wounded. Another 5,558 were killed or died as prisoners of war (POWs), while non-battle casualties in operational areas were also significant and included 1,088 killed and 33,196 wounded or injured. In addition, the Army suffered a substantial number of casualties in <b>non-operational</b> areas: 1,795 soldiers killed and 121,800 wounded or injured.|$|E

25|$|In a <b>non-operational</b> {{area which}} was not {{subjected}} to air attack and {{which was not}} closely threatened, the requirement was 360 days (one year) of service overseas from or outside the individual's country of residence. Military service overseas from the United Kingdom could qualify up to 2 September 1945, when {{the war in the}} Pacific ended. Service was reckonable from the date of embarkation and was counted at its full rate for the voyage to the <b>non-operational</b> area.|$|E
25|$|A mock-up of an Innovia ART 100 car was {{stored at}} the Toronto Transit Commission Wychwood Carhouse by Disney Displays. This car was {{unpainted}} and <b>non-operational.</b> The fate of this vehicle is unknown.|$|E
25|$|The {{force is}} overseen by an elected Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) on <b>non-operational</b> matters (i.e. budget and priorities). The current Hampshire PCC is Michael Lane, of the Conservative Party, {{who was elected}} in May 2016.|$|E
25|$|The Defence Medal {{was awarded}} for <b>non-operational</b> {{service in the}} Armed Forces, the Home Guard, the Civil Defence Service and other {{approved}} civilian services {{during the period from}} 3 September 1939 to 2 September 1945 inclusive.|$|E
25|$|The Defence Medal is a {{campaign}} medal which was instituted by the United Kingdom in May 1945, {{to be awarded}} to subjects of the British Commonwealth for both <b>non-operational</b> military and certain types of civilian service during the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Service by Indian Army {{personnel}} in India did not count as qualifying {{service for the}} Defence Medal, since such service qualified for the India Service Medal, awarded {{to members of the}} Indian Armed Forces instead of the Defence Medal for three years of <b>non-operational</b> service in India.|$|E
25|$|The mill {{contains}} {{a number of}} other steam powered exhibits, including a working Ashworth fire pump, already at Coldharbour, but repaired in 1984 with components from Bliss Mill; a very rare example of a low pressure wagon boiler dating from the late 1700s; and a (<b>non-operational)</b> steam powered flue fan.|$|E
25|$|The two PNG vessels {{were listed}} in Jane's Fighting Ships as <b>non-operational</b> since 2011, and {{awaiting}} refits. By 2013, {{they had been}} returned to service.

25|$|In May 1943, 54 HAA Regiment {{moved to}} Egypt, {{where it came}} under the <b>non-operational</b> 8th AA Bde in Middle East Forces. 312 Battery moved up and came under 89th HAA Rgt/AA Defence Command at Benghazi {{but the rest of}} the {{regiment}} remained in Egypt until it was placed in suspended animation in February 1945.|$|E
25|$|Royal Mail {{drafted in}} {{managers}} from <b>non-operational</b> roles {{to attempt to}} keep some mail moving through the system, and offered opportunities for those CWU members who wish to work to do so at other offices to avoid conflict with striking colleagues, but the strike still had {{a major impact on}} the operation.|$|E
25|$|On 27 August, the OCHA {{announced}} that airstrikes targeting that Al-Hudaydah port facilities late on 17 August and early 18 August {{had brought the}} port activities to a near halt and that the port was empty of all vessels and remained <b>non-operational.</b> A UN-chartered aid vessel carrying 2,230 MT of mixed food commodities left the port and was rerouted to Djibouti.|$|E
25|$|In December 1943 No. 71 Squadron's {{headquarters}} {{moved to}} Coffs Harbour, with the flight at Lowood following in June. In July 1944 {{it was decided}} to disband No. 71 and No. 73 squadrons as part of a reduction in the RAAF's ASW effort. The squadron was declared <b>non-operational</b> on 12 July 1944 but continued to fly training exercises until it was disbanded on 28 August.|$|E
25|$|The {{squadron}} {{was equipped}} with Handley Page Halifax B. Mk. II heavy bombers and flew its first operation {{on the night of}} 8–9 September 1942 against ground targets at Tobruk. No. 462 Squadron was the only Halifax-equipped squadron in North Africa during 1942 and suffered from shortages of aircrew as a result. This problem became so severe in December that the squadron became <b>non-operational</b> until January 1943.|$|E
25|$|The 301st Bombardment Wing at MacDill AFB, Florida {{received}} some B-50As reassigned from Davis-Monthan in early 1951, but used them for <b>non-operational</b> training pending {{the delivery of}} B-47A Stratojets in June 1951. The B-50 was built as an interim strategic bomber {{to be replaced by}} the B-47 Stratojet, but delays to the Stratojet forced the B-50 to soldier on until well into the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, this {{included}} military personnel working in headquarters, on training bases and airfields {{for the duration}} of the War in Europe from 3 September 1939 to 8 May 1945, and service by members of the Home Guard during its existence from 14 May 1940 to 31 December 1944.
