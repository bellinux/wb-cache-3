40|$|In {{the last}} seven years, {{tropical}} cities with a climate plan have tripled compared to the previous seven years. According to the 11 th United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal, climate planning should significantly increase by 2030. The Sendai framework for disaster risk reduction (2015) and the New urban agenda signed in Quito (2016) indicate how {{to achieve this goal}} through analysis, categories of plans and specific measures. This chapter identifies the main obstacles to the significant increase in tropical human settlements with a climate plan and the possible solutions. First of all, the distribution and trend at 2030 of tropical human settlements are ascertained. Then local access to information on damage, hazard, exposure, vulnerability and risk, and the consideration of these aspects in the <b>national</b> <b>guides</b> to local climate planning are verified. Lastly, the categories of plans and climate measures recommended by the United Nations are compared with those that are most common today, using a database of 401 climate plans for 338 tropical cities relating to 41 countries. The chapter highlights the fact that the prescription for treating tropical cities affected by climate change has been prepared without an accurate diagnosis. Significantly increasing climate planning must consider that small-medium human settlements in the Tropics will prevail at least until 2030. And most effort will be required from Developing and Least Developed Countries. The recommendations of the United Nations concerning the preliminary analyses ignore the fact that local authorities usually {{do not have access to}} the necessary information...|$|E
40|$|The <b>National</b> <b>guide</b> to a {{preventive}} health assessment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people was conceived and started by NACCHO in 2001 {{and went on}} to be supported by the RACGP from 2002. The first edition was published in 2005 and has proven to be widely used by health services and health policy makers to inform best practice in preventing disease in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. This second edition has been significantly updated and improved, with appraisal and endorsement from peak bodies across Australia. The <b>National</b> <b>Guide</b> is a practical resource intended for all health professionals delivering primary healthcare to Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people. Its purpose is to provide GPs and other health professionals with an accessible, user-friendly guide to best practice in preventive healthcare for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients. This second edition of the <b>National</b> <b>Guide</b> comprises: • the <b>National</b> <b>Guide,</b> which contains evidence statements, recommendations, risk calculation tables and an outline of the development of the guide • the evidence base: the collection of evidence underpinning the guide and recommendations (electronic only) (see the Methodology section ‘Searching the evidence base and drafting recommendations’) • a child and adult lifecycle summary chart listing activities recommended at each age group. The <b>National</b> <b>Guide</b> is available on the NACCHO and the RACGP websites at www. naccho. org. au and at www. racgp. org. au/aboriginalhealth/nationalguide. The <b>National</b> <b>Guide</b> is being integrated into clinical software over time to support primary healthcare professionals to implement best practice by providing them with accessible, accurate and up-to-date preventive health information relevant to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. For further information contact the RACGP National Faculty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health on 03 8699 0499 or email aboriginalhealth@racgp. org. au. Purpose: The <b>National</b> <b>Guide</b> is intended for all health professionals delivering primary healthcare to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. This includes general practitioners (GPs), Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health workers, nurses and those specialists with a role in delivering primary healthcare. The <b>National</b> <b>Guide</b> makes specific recommendations regarding the elements of {{a preventive}} health assessment across the lifecycle of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. The aim of the <b>National</b> <b>Guide</b> is to provide an up-to-date, evidence-based national resource that can help inform health providers and policy makers on a defined set of activities that are of particular relevance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. These activities may prevent disease, detect early and unrecognised disease, and promote health in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population while allowing for variations based on regional and local circumstances. The health status of Torres Strait Islander people is very {{similar to that of the}} Aboriginal population, and the information in the <b>National</b> <b>Guide</b> can be applied to both population groups...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Pregnant {{women often}} report {{a lack of}} {{knowledge}} concerning the safety of exercising during pregnancy. Healthcare providers play an integral role in providing pregnant women with the necessary knowledge to promote antenatal physical activity. Thus, the objective {{of this study was to}} assess healthcare providers’ beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and practices related to antenatal physical activity counseling. Study Design: 188 Providers (i. e. obstetricians, midwives, and family medicine physicians) completed a 39 closed-item survey. Characteristics among healthcare providers’ physical activity counseling practices as well as belief, attitudes and knowledge were explored. Results: The majority of all providers agreed that physical activity during pregnancy will result in numerous improved health outcomes for mother and baby. Approximately half of the providers (48 %, n = 89) were not familiar with the current <b>national</b> <b>guides</b> recommending that women free of obstetric complications should engage in at least 150 minutes of exercise per week. Only 43 % of providers believed their patients followed the advice they are given about physical activity. Over half of the providers reported that they provide in-office physical activity counseling, and FMs provide individualized counseling less often than OBs and CNMs (i. e. 33 %, 60 %, and 65 %, respectively; p = 0. 0014). Importantly, 17 % (n = 31) of providers reported that they never received professional training in antenatal physical activity counseling and of those that did receive training, 69 % (n = 107) claimed their training was “fair” or “poor”. Conclusion: Findings from the pre- sent study demonstrate a need for further continuing education opportunities on the current national guide- lines on antenatal physical activity...|$|E

40|$|The <b>National</b> <b>guide</b> to a {{preventive}} health assessment in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples (<b>National</b> <b>guide)</b> is an {{initiative of the}} National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO), lead agency of the Chronic Disease Alliance of Non- Government Organisations. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) supported {{the development of the}} <b>guide.</b> The <b>National</b> <b>guide</b> is intended for all health professionals delivering primary health care to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. This includes general practitioners (GPs), Aboriginal health workers, nurses and those specialists with a role in deliveringprimary health care. The <b>National</b> <b>guide</b> package consists of: The <b>National</b> <b>guide</b> • Recommendations compiled from the review of the Evidence base • Child and adult preventive health life cycle summaries. The Chronic Disease Alliance determined that recommendations in the <b>National</b> <b>guide</b> should be based on a review of the evidence, seeking where possible existing systematic reviews addressing questions related to preventive health care, expert opinion and consensus statements of relevance to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. The Evidence base documents the research literature used to form the <b>National</b> <b>guide</b> and can be accessed on the RACGP website at: www. racgp. org. au and on the NACCHO website at: www. naccho. org. au. Users of this guide are encouraged to access this Evidence base for more information. Health care providers (particularly in regional and remote areas) are also encouraged to refer to local guidelines (where they are appropriate and available) in order to optimise preventive health assessments. Many of the recommendations in the <b>National</b> <b>guide</b> describe health problems that may be of concern only in certain regional areas. For example, trichiasis screening is not appropriate in Victoria except when an elderly Aboriginal person from northern Australia is assessed. Consequently, many recommendations highlight the importance of clinical discretion in decision making. The <b>National</b> <b>guide</b> makes specific recommendations regarding the elements of {{a preventive}} health assessment in the non-pregnant adult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population as well as children. The aim is to provide a national evidence based resource that can inform health care providers and policy makers on a defined set of activities that are of particular relevance to this population, or that are different from those for the non-Indigenous population. These activities may prevent disease, detect early and unrecognised disease, and promote health in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population while allowing for variations based on regional and local circumstances. General practitioners should use the recommendations to enhance the clinical care that they provide to their Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients. The <b>National</b> <b>guide</b> aims to complement the RACGP Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice (known as the ‘red book’) by dealing with health issues that are specific to the Aboriginal and TorresStrait Islander population. The chosen subject areas represent key health issues that are amenable to primary health care intervention and contribute to morbidity and mortality in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. Where issues common in the general Australian population have not been dealt with in this guide (eg. osteoporosis), GPs are encouraged to cross reference with the ‘red book’ which is available on the RACGP website at: www. racgp. org. au/document. asp?id= 4169. To assist health care providers, the Evidence base used to form the <b>National</b> <b>guide</b> provides a summary of recommendations from the ‘red book’ and from other groups, such as the Central Australian Rural Practitioners Association and the Northern Zone Management Unit of Queensland Health in north Queensland. The authors have presented the information in this guide so that it can apply to both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It is recognised that, while the health of Torres Strait Islanders is very similar to the Aboriginal population, they represent a distinct Indigenous Australian population. Health care providers should use the <b>National</b> <b>guide</b> to systematically appraise current preventive practice, especially where recommendations for the general population have previously been applied to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients. Providers may also benefit by appraising certain screening activities for which there is little evidence. These activities may draw resources away from other activities to improve the health of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population, eg. risk factor modification and immunisation programs. General practitioners may undertake preventive health assessment activities as part of their normal consultations. Medicare benefits are payable for a medical examination or test on a symptomless patient by that patient’s own medical practitioner in the course of normal medical practice, to ensure the patient receives any medical advice or treatment necessary to maintain his or her state of health...|$|R
