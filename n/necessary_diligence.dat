Many children find the medication unpleasant and are not even aware of their HIV status. Part of this can be attributed to lapses in communication.

Sexual lifestyles are typically frowned upon in Uganda, particularly for women, which contributes to a poor dissemination of sexual related health information.|$|E

Based on this meta-model, we present a hypothesis on what adequacy means and how the adequacy of business processes and software can be determined. ...|$|E

40|$|This report reviews {{all options}} {{to reduce the}} risk of catastrophic bushfires from the {{electricity}} supply. The Powerline Bushfire Safety Taskforce (the Taskforce) was established to review all options {{to reduce the risk}} of catastrophic bushfires from the electricity supply. The Taskforce prepared a report, which was presented to the Victorian Government on 30 September 2011. The Taskforce has been supported by a Stakeholder Reference Group and a Victorian Government Interdepartmental Working Group. The members of the Taskforce, Stakeholder Reference Group and Interdepartmental Working Group have a broad range of skills, knowledge and experience, including in network and non-network technology solutions, bushfires, risk management and consumer behaviour. This mix of skills has facilitated a thorough examination of, and robust debate on, all the issues. The electricity distributors, Country Fire Authority and Energy Safe Victoria have been actively considering how to reduce the likelihood of powerlines starting bushfires, and provided the outcomes of their considerations to the Taskforce. New information that was not available to the Royal Commission has been gathered and considered. This information related to: the energy required to ignite a bushfire under a range of conditions variation in fire loss consequence across Victoria new technologies that substantially reduce the likelihood of powerlines starting bushfires. The Taskforce commissioned customer research that provided a better understanding of the trade-off that the community would support between reducing the risk of bushfires and the consequent impacts on the cost of electricity, supply reliability, and on the environment and landowners. Meetings were held with regional and rural communities at seven centres around Victoria and the Taskforce received written submissions to its Consultation Paper. Field trials provided valuable information to assist the Taskforce in making its recommendations. The Taskforce‘s recommendations prioritise actions to reduce the likelihood of bushfire from powerlines to those areas of Victoria that have the highest fire loss consequence. By doing so, the increase in the cost of electricity should be manageable for Victorians, while minimising adverse impacts on supply reliability, the environment and landowners. Taskforce members have undertaken the <b>necessary</b> due <b>diligence</b> of all the information that is available at the time of writing this report. They have applied their expertise and professional judgement to make the recommendations in this report.

40|$|May 2011 was a {{very bad}} month for UK banks. In the {{previous}} month, a long-running legal case was resolved when the UK High Court ruled against the British Bankers 'Association, which had petitioned for a judicial review of regulatory action concerning mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI) products. Following the ruling, the four major UK banks announced provisions totaling over £ 6 billion to cover restitution to buyers of their PPI products. Some of the banks also decided to exit the PPI business. At first glance, PPI {{appears to be a}} standard insurance product. For an up-front or monthly premium, an insurer will sell protection to a borrower against being unable to make loan repayments, as a result of illness or unemployment, for example. Before the market collapsed, the main distributors/arrangers of PPI contracts were the largest UK banks, often using their affiliated insurance subsidiary as the insurer. The underlying problems that generated the so-called PP I scandal should not have come as a complete surprise to the banks. For several years prior to the ruling, consumer advocacy groups had been complaining loudly about banks selling PPI products to customers who did not fully understand the policies and, in many cases, did not need the protection provided. Yet, having seemingly taken {{on a life of its}} own, the practice of selling PPI policies continued and grew rapidly in all major banks. Various official inquiries found that the "people" involved, including frontline bank staff, lending managers and insurers, simply did not e:cercise the due <b>diligence</b> <b>necessary</b> to check the suitability of PPI for many customers. Prudence seems to have been diluted or even abandoned in a chase for increased product volume across the whole UK retail banking sector. This paper argues that the losses incurred as a result of the PPI scandal were, in most part, precipitated by systemic operational risk, particularly people-related risks. Using examples from official inquiries, this paper identifies some of the people risk that went unmanaged in this part of the UK retail banking sector system, until the PPI market seized up in 2011. The paper then suggests proactive approaches to people risk management that should help to detect and minimize the impact of similar scandals in the future. This topic is important as the demographic shift toward longer periods of retirement and the prevalence of the "universal banking model" means that nontraditional banking products such as insurance, pensions and investments will be increasingly sold through banks, raising the specter of further mis-selling scandals in the future. 61 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical thesis. Bibliography: leaves 304 - 321. 1. Introduction and {{outline of}} thesis {{structure}} [...] 2. Context for governance of {{mergers and acquisitions}} [...] 3. Literature review [...] 4. Research question and objectives [...] 5. Methodology selected and research design [...] 6. Results and analysis [...] 7. Conclusions and {{emergence of a new}} theory. Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are critical mechanisms for corporate growth and potentially for increased shareholder returns. The reality, however, often does not live up to the promise, as is borne out by empirical data on the high incidence rates of M&A under-performance. At present in Australia, directors and executive management, particularly of the acquiring company, have considerable latitude to put at-risk shareholder value via M&A without any meaningful pre-event restraints or post-event sanctions (and with the benefit of the Business Judgment Rule defence). The old adage caveat emptor (‘let the buyer beware’) still holds true for buyers, {{but when it comes to}} ensuring that shareholders’ interests and capital are properly protected, there is little clarity on what are the acceptable ‘checks and balances’, key activities and behaviours of the directors of the acquiring company, that represent responsible standards of conduct. The initial question to be considered is whether there is a discernible set of ‘right practices’ that provide a reference set of benchmarks for non-executive directors to know whether they are exercising the <b>necessary</b> care, <b>diligence</b> and skill in selecting and overseeing transactions. Looking from the ‘outside in’, the corollary is ‘How do shareholders in the acquiring company have some visibility and assurance that their executive management team and board are exercising (or have exercised) sufficient due diligence (in the broadest sense of the word) ?’The challenge thus arises as to how to describe the ‘right practice’ stewardship that should be exercised by ‘reasonable directors’ of the acquiring entity to manage the risks and performance of transactions – before, during and after acquisition. This thesis focuses on identifying and describing ‘right governance’ i. e. the required level and mix of actions and responsibilities of directors of the acquiring company, necessary for protecting the interests of their shareholders. To carry out this research, and to shed light on these gaps in knowledge and required practices, the extant commercial, governance and legal literature relating to M&A practice has been studied; and has been juxtaposed with the opinions and experiences of a cross-section of non-executive directors and Chairmen, emerging from targeted interviews (‘grounded research’). From these gaps has arisen an emergent theory regarding ‘right practice’. The emergent theory points to six key themes that those directors interviewed believe make a difference to deal performance: (1) the Board’s degree of strategic thinking (‘Clear strategy upfront’); (2) planning and preparation (‘Early preparation and planning’); (3) the extent of board members’ cultural due-diligence (‘Proper understanding of culture’); (4) robust business-case scrutiny and investment assessment (‘Rigorous testing of the investment business case and funding strategy’); (5) their focus on tracking the delivery of the targeted benefits (‘Effective monitoring post transaction’); and (6) the quality of their mutual challenge and critical debate (‘Well-chaired board with constructive challenge’). These emergent board-level themes have been compared to the extant literature to examine whether similar learnings and congruent practices have been articulated or whether there are key gaps or contradictions between the emergent theory and the extant literature. In most cases there is alignment, although the interviewed directors’ views have crystallised what in the literature could best be described as ‘un-consolidated ideas’ based on ‘an extrapolation of managerial practices’, as the body of documented knowledge is generally not targeted at board members. This process of comparison has indicated that these initial findings have merit and should be regarded as an emergent theory. Whilst still not a guarantee for success, these themes – once subjected to further testing and validation for relevance and impact – could help to crystallise standard board practices in a way that better meets M&A transaction demands and more effectively serves shareholder expectations in the 21 st century.
