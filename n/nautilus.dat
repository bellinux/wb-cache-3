5|$|After {{entering}} service, <b>Nautilus</b> and Albatross alternated between {{service with}} the High Seas Fleet; <b>Nautilus</b> {{participated in the}} annual fleet maneuvers in 1907 and 1908, {{and was replaced by}} Albatross thereafter. <b>Nautilus</b> was modernized at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel in 190910, and Albatross underwent a similar modernization there in 191011. While Albatross was out of service, <b>Nautilus</b> temporarily returned to the fleet. Once the former's refit was completed in 1911, the latter was transferred to mine warfare training in the North Sea before being decommissioned {{at the end of the}} year. Albatross remained in service through 1914, but apart from a collision with the steamer , the time passed uneventfully.|$|E
5|$|The ships' hulls were {{constructed}} from transverse and longitudinal steel frames, and {{were divided into}} nine watertight compartments, with a double bottom that extended for 60percent {{of the length of}} the hull. Both vessels had two pole masts fitted with spotting tops. <b>Nautilus</b> and Albatross had different bows; <b>Nautilus</b> received a clipper bow, while Albatross had a ram bow like contemporary German light cruisers. Albatross also had a higher forecastle that extended {{to the base of the}} main mast, while <b>Nautilus</b> was completed with a superstructure deck that began just aft of the fore mast.|$|E
5|$|Deimatic display {{occurs in}} widely {{separated}} groups of animals, including moths, butterflies, mantises and phasmids among the insects. In the cephalopods, {{different species of}} octopuses, squids, cuttlefish and the paper <b>nautilus</b> are deimatic.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{study in}} 2008, a group of <b>nautiluses</b> (N. pompilius) were given food as a bright blue light flashed until they began to {{associate}} the light with food, extending their tentacles every time the blue light was flashed. The blue light was again flashed without the food 3 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours later. The <b>nautiluses</b> continued to respond excitedly to the blue light for up to 30 minutes after the experiment. An hour later they showed no reaction to the blue light. However, between 6 and 12 hours after the training, they again responded to the blue light, but more tentatively. The researchers concluded that <b>nautiluses</b> had memory capabilities similar to the [...] "short-term" [...] and [...] "long-term memories" [...] of the more advanced cephalopods, despite having different brain structures. However the long-term memory capability of <b>nautiluses</b> was much shorter than that of other cephalopods. The <b>nautiluses</b> completely forgot the earlier training 24 hours later, in contrast to octopuses, for example, which can remember conditioning for weeks afterwards. However, this may be simply {{the result of the}} conditioning procedure being suboptimal for sustaining long-term memories in <b>nautiluses.</b> Nevertheless, the study showed that scientists had previously underestimated the memory capabilities of <b>nautiluses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Both {{octopuses}} and <b>nautiluses</b> {{are capable}} of vertebrate-like spatial learning.|$|R
5|$|Jenner had {{licensed}} {{her previous}} name for Bruce Jenner's Westwood Centers for <b>Nautilus</b> & Aerobics {{in the early}} 1980s to David A. Cirotto, president of other local <b>Nautilus</b> & Aerobics Centers. She had no ownership in the licensed name centers, which were solely owned by Cirotto. Jenner's company, Bruce Jenner Aviation, sells aircraft supplies to executives and corporations. Jenner was the business development vice president for a staffing industry software application known as JennerNet, {{which was based on}} Lotus Domino technology.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nautilus</b> {{spent her}} peacetime career {{conducting}} training exercises {{with the main}} fleet and minesweeping experiments before being placed in reserve in 1911. Reactivated {{at the start of}} World War I, she initially laid both defensive and offensive mine fields in the North and Baltic Seas. She was permanently transferred to the Baltic in 1916, and the following year she supported Operation Albion, the conquest of the Gulf of Riga. After Germany's defeat, <b>Nautilus</b> was demilitarized and used as a hulk from 1921 to 1928 before being sold for scrap and broken up in Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|Albatross was {{returned}} to Germany {{after the war ended}} in 1918, and both vessels were stricken from the naval register in 1919. Albatross, never repaired from the damage sustained in 1915, was sold for scrap immediately, but <b>Nautilus</b> was retained as a hulk until 1928, when she too was broken up.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nautiluses</b> {{reproduce}} {{by laying}} eggs. Gravid females attach the fertilized eggs to rocks in shallow waters, whereupon the eggs take eight to twelve months to develop until the 30 mm juveniles hatch. Females spawn once {{per year and}} regenerate their gonads, making <b>nautiluses</b> the only cephalopods to present iteroparity or polycyclic spawning.|$|R

50|$|The {{lifespan}} of <b>nautiluses</b> may exceed 20 years, {{which is}} exceptionally lengthy for a cephalopod, {{many of whom}} live less than three even in captivity and under ideal living conditions. However, <b>nautiluses</b> typically do not reach sexual maturity until they are about 15 years old, limiting their reproductive lifespan to often less than five years.|$|R
5|$|HMS Glasgow {{returned}} to Newport, {{suffering from the}} battle and having dumped her dispatches. She {{was found to be}} in bad shape; she was made as seaworthy as possible and sent to Portsmouth for repairs. Her mission was reassigned to HMS <b>Nautilus,</b> another ship in the Newport squadron.|$|E
5|$|Ballard's {{subsequent}} {{search for}} the Japanese carriers was unsuccessful. In September 1999, a joint expedition between Nauticos Corp. and the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office searched for the Japanese aircraft carriers. Using advanced renavigation techniques {{in conjunction with the}} ship's log of the submarine USS <b>Nautilus,</b> the expedition located a large piece of wreckage, subsequently identified as having come from the upper hangar deck of Kaga. The main wreck of Kaga has yet to be located.|$|E
5|$|Deimatic {{behaviour}} {{is found}} in cephalopods including the common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, squid such as the Caribbean reef squid (Sepioteuthis sepioidea) and bigfin reef squid (Sepioteuthis lessoniana), octopuses including the common octopus Octopus vulgaris and the Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Octopus macropus), and the paper <b>nautilus</b> (Argonauta argo). Deimatic cephalopod displays involve suddenly creating bold stripes, often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web {{to make it look}} as big and threatening as possible.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{many other}} cephalopods, <b>nautiluses</b> {{do not have}} what many {{consider}} to be good vision; their eye structure is highly developed but lacks a solid lens. Whereas a sealed lens allows {{for the formation of}} highly focused and clear, detailed surrounding imagery, <b>nautiluses</b> have a simple pinhole eye open to the environment which only allows for the creation of correspondingly simple imagery.|$|R

5|$|His {{observations}} on catfish, electric fish (Torpedo) and angler fish are detailed, {{as is his}} writing on cephalopods including the octopus, cuttlefish and the paper <b>nautilus.</b> His claim that the octopus had a hectocotyl arm which was perhaps used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved, until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays {{were part of the}} group he called SelachÄ“ (roughly, the modern zoologist's selachians).|$|E
5|$|In the argonaut (paper <b>nautilus),</b> {{the female}} secretes a fine, fluted, papery shell {{in which the}} eggs are {{deposited}} and in which she also resides while floating in mid-ocean. In this she broods the young, and it {{also serves as a}} buoyancy aid allowing her to adjust her depth. The male argonaut is minute by comparison and has no shell.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nautilus</b> was {{transferred}} to the Baltic in 1916, and took part in Operation Albion in 1917, where she supported the conquest of the Gulf of Riga. In 1918, she was modified to support amphibious operations, with her 8.8cm guns replaced by a host of smaller weapons. She was assigned to the Sonderverband tasked with supporting the White Finns during the Finnish Civil War, though she did not see action. Instead, she spent the remainder of the war patrolling in the eastern Baltic. After the war ended in November 1918, <b>Nautilus</b> was demilitarized according to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and hulked; she was renamed Hulk I and later Hulk A, eventually being scrapped in 1928. Albatross, meanwhile, had been refloated by a Swedish salvage company in July 1915 and interned {{for the rest of the}} war. She was returned in 1919, stricken from the naval register and scrapped that year.|$|E

5|$|Snow meets Cid and Fang, {{two members}} of the Cavalry, after he is {{captured}} and detained aboard the airship Lindblum. Meanwhile, the others flee from PSICOM before getting separated by an airstrike; Hope and Lightning travel to Palumpolum, while Sazh and Vanille travel to <b>Nautilus.</b> In Lightning's scenario, she unintentionally supports Hope's goal of killing Snow to avenge his mother's death. In Vanille's scenario, Sazh discusses how his son Dajh was turned into a l'Cie by a Cocoon fal'Cie and was taken by PSICOM to discover his Focus. In Palumpolum, Lightning attempts to dissuade Hope from going through with his revenge and meets Snow and Fang. Fang reveals that she and Vanille were l'Cie from Pulse who were turned into crystals; they were turned back into humans 13 days earlier, sparking the Purge. Hope attempts to murder Snow, but after being rescued during an airstrike, he decides not to go through with it. The four then flee the city with Cid's aid. In <b>Nautilus,</b> Vanille reveals herself to Sazh as a l'Cie from Pulse, and indirectly the reason that Dajh was turned into a l'Cie. Sazh and Vanille are then captured and detained on board the airship Palamecia.|$|E
5|$|Spirals {{are common}} in plants and in some animals, notably molluscs. For example, in the <b>nautilus,</b> a {{cephalopod}} mollusc, each chamber of its shell is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor and arranged in a logarithmic spiral. Given a modern understanding of fractals, a growth spiral {{can be seen as}} a special case of self-similarity.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 NOAA divers {{and volunteers}} {{returned}} to the Monitor {{with the goal of}} obtaining overall video of the site to create a permanent record of the current conditions on the wreck after the turret recovery. Jeff Johnston of the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary (MNMS) also wanted a definitive image of the vessel's pilothouse. During the dives, Monitors iron pilothouse was located near the bow of the vessel and documented for the first time by videographer Rick Allen, of <b>Nautilus</b> Productions, in its inverted position.|$|E

50|$|The Argonautidae are {{a family}} of {{cephalopods}} encompassing the modern paper <b>nautiluses</b> of the genus Argonauta along with several extinct genera of shelled octopods.|$|R
50|$|<b>Nautiluses</b> {{are found}} in only the Indo-Pacific, from 30Â° N to 30Â° S {{latitude}} and 90Â° E to 175Â° E longitude. They inhabit the deep slopes of coral reefs.|$|R
5|$|Logarithms {{have many}} {{applications}} {{inside and outside}} mathematics. Some of these occurrences {{are related to the}} notion of scale invariance. For example, each chamber of the shell of a <b>nautilus</b> is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor. This gives rise to a logarithmic spiral. Benford's law on the distribution of leading digits can also be explained by scale invariance. Logarithms are also linked to self-similarity. For example, logarithms appear in the analysis of algorithms that solve a problem by dividing it into two similar smaller problems and patching their solutions. The dimensions of self-similar geometric shapes, that is, shapes whose parts resemble the overall picture are also based on logarithms.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{is responsible}} for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the bee-eater, kingfisher and roller, for example), as well as many butterfly wings, beetle wing-cases (elytra) and (while rare among flowers) the gloss of buttercup petals. These are often iridescent, as in peacock feathers and nacreous shells such as of pearl oysters (Pteriidae) and <b>Nautilus.</b> This is because the reflected colour depends on the viewing angle, which in turn governs the apparent spacing of the structures responsible. Structural colours can be combined with pigment colours: peacock feathers are pigmented brown with melanin, while buttercup petals have both carotenoid pigments for yellowness and thin films for reflectiveness.|$|E
5|$|The stage musical {{follows the}} basic {{structure}} of the film, but there are some differences between the two. In this version, Ursula is Triton's sister and Ariel's aunt. In a new subplot, Grimsby holds a contest inviting all the princesses in the land for a singing competition for Eric to choose his bride; Ariel cannot sing, but she dances for Eric, and he chooses her. Ariel also has {{a more active role in}} the final battle, where she is the one who defeats Ursula by destroying her <b>Nautilus</b> shell that contains her power.|$|E

25|$|Cuttlefish or cuttles are marine {{animals of}} the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda, which also {{includes}} squid, octopuses, and <b>nautiluses.</b> Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone. Despite their name, cuttlefish are not fish but molluscs.|$|R
50|$|Various {{accounts}} of cephalopod attacks on humans {{have been reported}} since the 13th century. Cephalopods {{are members of the}} class Cephalopoda, which include all squid, octopi, cuttlefish, and <b>nautiluses.</b> Some members of the group are capable of causing injury or even death to humans.|$|R
