50|$|In economics, a {{time-based}} {{currency is}} an alternative currency or exchange system where the unit of account/value is the person-hour or some other time unit.Some time-based currencies value everyone’s contributions equally: one hour equals one service credit. In these systems, one person volunteers to work for an hour for another person; thus, they are credited with one hour, which they can redeem for an hour of service from another volunteer. Others use time units that might be fractions of an hour (e.g. minutes, ten minutes - 6 units/hour, or 15 minutes - 4 units/hour). While most time-based exchange systems are service exchanges in that most exchange involves the provision of services that {{can be measured in}} a time unit, it is also possible to exchange goods by 'pricing' them in terms of the average national hourly wage rate (e.g. if the average hourly rate is $20/hour, then a commodity valued at $20 in the <b>national</b> <b>currency</b> would be <b>equivalent</b> to 1 hour).|$|R

40|$|When {{countries}} {{of different sizes}} participate in a cooperative agreement, the potential gain from deviation determines the minimum power that each country requires in the common decision-making. This paper studies {{the problem in the}} context of a common currency, which requires coordination of monetary policies. In the presence of externalities in the decentralized equilibrium with <b>national</b> <b>currencies,</b> it is shown that a small economy will in general require, and obtain, more than proportional power in the agreement. With a common <b>currency,</b> this is <b>equivalent</b> to a transfer of seigniorage revenues in its favour. With <b>national</b> <b>currencies</b> such transfer would not occur, and without additional unconstrained fiscal instruments it would be impossible to sustain coordination with fixed exchange rates. When the number of potential countries in the union is large, it is not generally possible to prevent deviations from individual countries or from coalitions. The probability of deviation rises sharply with the number of countries and of possible coalitions. Cooperation; Currency Union; Seigniorage...|$|R

In other countries, the <b>national</b> <b>currency's</b> value fluctuates within a band (generally 15%) around a set rate. Currencies pegged to the euro include the currencies of Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Cape Verde. Denmark has a foreign exchange band tied to the euro.|$|R

40|$|Measuring the {{economic}} stock of money, defined {{to be the}} present value of current and future monetary service flows, is a difficult asset pricing problem, because most monetary assets yield interest. Thus, an interest yielding monetary asset is a joint product: a durable good providing a monetary service flow and a financial asset yielding a return. The currency equilivant index provides an elegant solution, but it does so by making strong assumptions about expectations of future monetary service flows. These assumptions cause the <b>currency</b> <b>equivalent</b> index to exhibit significant downward bias. In this paper, we propose an extension to the <b>currency</b> <b>equivalent</b> index that will correct for a significant amount of this bias. ...|$|R
5000|$|Changes {{in price}} indices trigger {{changes in prices}} of goods. Contracts are made to {{accommodate}} this price-changing scenario by means of indexation. Indexation in a high-inflation economy is evident when, for instance, a given price must be recalculated at a later date, incorporating inflation accumulated over the period to [...] "correct" [...] the price. In other cases, local currency prices can be {{expressed in terms of}} a foreign currency. At some point in the future, prices are converted back from the foreign <b>currency</b> <b>equivalent</b> into local <b>currency.</b> This conversion from a [...] "stronger" [...] <b>currency</b> <b>equivalent</b> value (i.e. the foreign currency) is intended to protect the real value of goods, as the nominal value depreciates.|$|R
