Introduction Australia’s Federation has worked well since 1901. Since that time, Australian governments have worked together to help deliver a standard of living that makes us the envy of much of the world. Australia today, though, {{is very different from the}} country it was back then—the world in which Australians live has changed enormously, and continues to change at a rapid rate. So, the question needs to be asked—is our Federation still fit for purpose? Does it provide the system of national governance that Australians <b>need</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> and will it help or hinder efforts to adapt and thrive in the vastly different economic, political and social realities of the 21 st century? There are many opportunities and challenges facing the Australian economy. Asia’s economic strength continues to increase and the global economy is becoming more integrated. There is no room for complacency, otherwise Australia risks being left behind on the world stage—meaning fewer jobs, lower economic growth, and lower living standards. This challenge should not be underestimated. Technological change is disrupting and making obsolete traditional models of business and government. It is also empowering individuals and local communities with new knowledge and opportunities. Is Australia ready for this...|$|E

5000|$|Kanban: Kanban is the {{foundational}} practice of lean thinking (the Toyota Production System {{used to be}} first known as the Kanban system). Any process will have different output. For instance, nowadays, a writer will produce books, keynote speeches, blog posts, tweets and answer e-mails. The question is, {{at the present time}} <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> how can the person using the process know whether they are doing what is <b>needed</b> for customers <b>right</b> <b>now</b> or whether they are working ahead on something not that important and lagging behind on something critical. In project management this creates segments ahead and segments late, and end of project panic. In production this creates entire warehouses of inventories to compensate for the inability to produce <b>right</b> <b>now</b> what is <b>needed.</b> Kanban is a simple technique using cards or post-it notes to visualize “leveled” (i.e. averaged to avoid peaks and troughs) activity at the process. The writer will start a new book when she’s delivered one. She will worry about the new conference when it’s time to. She will write a new blog post at a steady rhythm rather than publish five in a rush and then one and so on. In production, Kanban cards make sure employees are working on what is <b>needed</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> and not overproducing parts which will then linger in inventory whilst others will be unavailable. Kanban is the main practice to reveal all misfits between today’s activities and how the market behaves. Kanban teaches one lean thinking by constantly challenging assumptions about market behavior and our own flexibility.|$|R
40|$|Academic Medical Centers (AMCs) are an {{integral}} component {{of the health care}} system in the United States. With such a unique purpose and sweeping influence, AMCs play an indispensable role in transforming the health care delivery system. To transition from volume to value, value-based purchasing programs play an equally important role. The purpose of this study is to understand if the hospital value-based purchasing program is achieving its stated goal of improving patient outcomes, safety, and patients’ care experience in the academic medical center setting. Objectives include evaluating how AMCs have been impacted by this program, what results have been realized so far, and if any adverse effects exist. This will be accomplished by reviewing literature and publications relevant to hospital value-based purchasing in the context of academic medical centers and the broader category of tertiary care providers. Pay-for-performance and value-based purchasing programs preceding the hospital value-based purchasing program, showed no statistically significant results on clinical quality, outcomes, costs, unintended effects, and effects on disparities in the hospital setting. In 2016, 64 % of teaching hospitals received penalties, while only 36 % received bonuses. Under the hospital value-based purchasing program, academic medical centers are currently at a financial disadvantage due to the vulnerable populations they serve, along with the cost and implications of teaching and researching. It is critical to innovation and redesign that AMCs flourish and thrive, with enough funding to achieve their tripartite mission of care, research, and education. They function as an incubator for cutting-edge treatments, are responsible for training future generations of medical professionals, and act as a safety net for the communities they serve. They are the economic engine of many communities and improve the health of the people that surround them. Although there is limited quantifiable outcomes associated with HVBP’s goals currently, the program is an important and necessary step in the evolution of the United States health care system. Outcomes and results must be analyzed intensively and used to constantly improve value-based purchasing measures. The hospital value-based purchasing program is significant to public health because many people can’t afford the medical care they <b>need</b> <b>right</b> <b>now...</b>|$|E
40|$|If "me too-ism" means bipartisanship then it 2 ̆ 7 s not all bad, writes NICHOLAS GRUEN JUST as Paul Keating’s {{penchant for}} divisiveness and {{cultural}} warfare was {{a prelude to}} his successor John Howard’s brand of politics, so the template for Rudd’s “me too” election was Howard’s “small target” strategy in 1996. “Me too” {{is a response to}} the (growing?) advantages of political incumbency and the rigorously enforced media values of infotainment, though Wednesday’s campaign launch suggests we’ve already seen the high watermark of “me too. ” In an age where politicians’ messages only travel in sound bites and photo ops, every unscripted moment or departure from the conventional wisdom spells danger. Dr Hewson’s very reasonable (but complex) explanation of how his GST would affect the price of a birthday cake is a legendary cautionary tale of how not to campaign. His error? Answering the question. And discussing policy [...] . in detail. That’s no way to handle the mother of all scare campaigns, where the media had long since abandoned interest in the policy detail and were back to race-calling the election and telling us how disastrously “off message” John Hewson had been. Governments can control the news with policy making (and leaking), agenda setting and “information campaigns. ” And they can thrash out new policy over long periods of feedback between themselves and officials. By contrast, under the Charter of Budget Honesty oppositions get one hour’s notice of officials’ first and final costings of their policies before they’re released. Living in terror of the next “wedge” or scare campaign and the embarrassment - deserved or not - of official disagreement with their costings, those words “me too” are a haven in a heartless world for an Opposition. Still, where “me too” is a dirty word for the media, robbing it of the oxygen of set piece battles to report, we might ask whether “me too” - that’s bipartisanship we’re talking about - is all bad. When it comes to constitutional change, history teaches that each major party has a veto. There’s now a tacit understanding that it’s “me too” or a lost referendum. And there’s a class of policies which, though broadly agreed as worthy by informed policy makers, would also be electoral poison if a party tried to implement them without bipartisan agreement. For example, reducing concessions on taxing the family home, capital gains and negative gearing could fund large reductions in other taxes. And both state and Commonwealth governments should replace the plethora of special deals given to senior citizens and others with greater assistance for those in genuine <b>need.</b> <b>Right</b> <b>now</b> neither party can say much about these issues for fear of the inevitable scare campaign. Political leaders might cut through this Gordian knot by indicating that they support such measures but only if there was broader political support including from their opponents. Could this happen soon? Probably not. It’s simpler to stick to the pantomime morality in which words and deeds move in lock step. There’s another kind of “me tooism” that requires no great courage for a politician to grasp - only the imagination to see its advantages. Caution in the absence of stronger support can guard against hubris and so lead to a firmer and more long lasting grip on power. After the debacle of Iraq, the new British prime minister Gordon Brown is making a splash by reasserting the role of parliament over the executive, for instance in committing troops abroad. Had John Howard stayed truer to public sentiment regarding our participation in Iraq (not to mention workplace reform) he might look a little less worried today. It’s not too late, even in this campaign, for either side to get the ball rolling in making the transition from the negativity of “me tooism” to a more constructive “you tooism. ” It could do a Gordon Brown and commit itself never to send Australian soldiers into direct combat overseas without bipartisan support. Meanwhile, if the government had thought harder about the dynamics of “me too” it might have pitched Monday’s policy launch differently. If the election were a simple auction, the government’s near 10 billion of new spending provided a budget, a new benchmark of respectability, from which Labor could play “me too” and cherry pick. As it’s turned out, it gave Rudd the opportunity to differentiate his offering more fully. Whose judgement is superior? Time will tell. • Nicholas Gruen is CEO of Lateral Economics and Visiting Fellow at ANU and University of Melbourne. This article first appeared in the Australian Financial Review.

40|$|Growth’ {{is back on}} the {{business}} agenda for 2016, underscored by the release of the highly anticipated Innovation Statement. Consumer confidence is 10 per cent higher than a year ago, and the retail sector just had one of its best Christmas seasons in years. But while the shift towards optimism marks a refreshing change for our economy, disruption is wrecking havoc on traditional businesses. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has recognised that what we’ve been doing in the past isn’t working anymore. He has urged all Australians to think differently, be nimble, and look for segments with untapped potential for economic growth. Many global economies, including Australia, have identified ‘commercialising innovation’ and ‘more start-ups’ as ‘segments with untapped potential’.   While both certainly do have potential, it takes time for research to be commercialised, and early-stage companies simply cannot grow fast enough to create the numbers of jobs we <b>need,</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> in Australia. Where can we draw our growth vision? Big business (companies with over $ 40 m in revenue and 200 employees) occupies a large part of our mindshare in Australia. Big business has ample access to financial resources, ongoing government support, and is well covered by the media. And even though big business constitutes less than 1 per cent of all companies in Australia, it employs approximately 30 per cent of the workforce and in 2011 provided 43 per cent of the value-add to the Australian economy. However, big business has recently announced closures and is laying off large numbers of people, with severe impacts on state and local economies. Of Australia’s 2. 13 million companies with ABNs, 85 per cent of them are sole proprietors or micro businesses with fewer than 5 employees. Only 15 per cent have more than five employees and $ 5 m in revenue. The 2015 federal budget provided tax breaks for Australia’s smallest businesses, and incentives for them to invest in technology and other major purchases. There’s no question that small business and start-ups are important to our economy; they are the seeds from which the corporations of the future will emerge. But any hope that the tax breaks would kickstart a recruitment spree has faded. Very few Australian small businesses have the revenue or the management capacity to scale up significantly and recruit substantial numbers of new employees. In short, it’s clear that neither big business nor start-ups {{are going to be able}} to solve the employment problem we are facing, right now. On the other hand, there are approximately 300, 000 companies in the ‘upper small to medium’ size category with annual revenues between $ 5 m and $ 50 m. These are the companies that hold the key to our current economic problems. These companies have products, customers, revenue, a team, and employees. With a bit of education and some knowledge about how to scale, many managing directors and chief executives could accelerate their growth and create a substantial number of new job opportunities in a matter of months, not years. As a case in point, the University of South Australia’s Centre for Business Growth, with support from ANZ, selected 10 ANZ customer companies from ten different industries across Australia. All had revenues between $ 5 m and $ 50 m.   At the end of the nine-month business growth program, this group achieved an aggregate revenue increase of 24 per cent. In addition to top-line growth (from $ 132 m to $ 164 m), their bottom line grew as well: profit increased 29 per cent. Jobs increased by 114, and the companies are projecting 332 new employees by the end of the fiscal year. In 2015 the centre held growth clinics with chief executives and managing directors of 85 mid-sized companies that had stopped growing. The chief executives wanted to continue growing but didn’t know how. We found that some had the wrong people on the bus — or in the wrong seats on the bus. Others did not have the right marketing or channel strategy. Some didn’t understand the roles they should be playing at that stage of growth; others did not understand their leadership responsibilities. Some had the wrong business model; others had hit the ‘ceiling of complexity’. The good news is that in one day many of these executives were able to learn what to stop doing, what to begin doing, why, and how. They left the clinic with an action plan, and follow-up research indicates that 56 per cent of them are growing again. Given these results, consider what could happen if we enabled just 10 per cent (30, 000) of our ‘upper small’ and medium-sized companies to learn how to grow. The results would be staggering. In short, we need to continue to support research commercialisation and start-ups. But if we want to create jobs right now, we need to be much more proactive about engaging with the leaders of ‘upper small’ and mid-sized Australian businesses that have the desire and the potential to grow. If we provide them with education and support and develop their capacity to grow their companies, we will unlock the next phase of economic growth in Australia. • Dr Jana Matthews is ANZ Chair in Business Growth, Director, Centre for Business Growth, University of South Australia, and a board member of StartupAUS.
