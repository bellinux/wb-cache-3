25|$|In their ROs, Gibson used {{incandescent}} lamps, {{which required}} relatively large currents. Fender {{replaced them with}} <b>neon</b> <b>lamps,</b> which increased the modulation frequency and reduced the controlling currents. However, {{in contrast to the}} continuous modulation by Gibson, Fender used the on/off switching mode that resulted in less pleasant sound. For this reason, other producers like Univibe preferred incandescent lamps.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Gibson and Fender started using ROs to {{modulate}} the tremolo effect in guitar amplifiers. Both companies were assembling their ROs from discrete lamps, photoresistors and coupling tubes. While Gibson used cheap but slow incandescent lamps as light sources, Fender {{replaced them with}} <b>neon</b> <b>lamps,</b> which increased the maximum frequency to tens of Hz and reduced controlling currents, but resulted in a nonlinear modulation. Therefore, other producers preferred incandescent lamps for their linearity.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} signs used {{incandescent light}} bulbs; these were replaced with neon lights and with moving signs (there {{was a large}} Guinness clock at one time). The first Neon sign was for the British meat extract Bovril. From December 1998, digital projectors {{were used for the}} Coke sign, the square's first digital billboard, while in the 2000s there was a gradual move to LED displays, which completely replaced <b>neon</b> <b>lamps</b> by 2011. The number of signs has reduced over the years as the rental costs have increased.|$|E
25|$|For simple, low-powered loads {{such as a}} <b>neon</b> <b>lamp</b> or a LED, a fixed {{resistor}} is commonly used.

5000|$|A <b>neon</b> <b>lamp</b> (also <b>neon</b> glow <b>lamp)</b> is a {{miniature}} gas discharge lamp. The lamp typically {{consists of a}} small glass capsule that contains a mixture of neon and other gases at a low pressure and two electrodes (an anode and a cathode). When sufficient voltage is applied and sufficient current is supplied between the electrodes, the lamp produces an orange glow discharge. The glowing portion in the lamp is a thin region near the cathode; the larger and much longer neon signs are also glow discharges, but they use the [...] which is not present in the ordinary <b>neon</b> <b>lamp.</b> <b>Neon</b> glow <b>lamps</b> are widely used as indicator lamps in the displays of electronic instruments and appliances.|$|R
25|$|The term {{can also}} {{refer to the}} {{miniature}} neon glow lamp, developed in 1917, about seven years after neon tube lighting. While neon tube lights are typically meters long, the <b>neon</b> <b>lamps</b> can be less than one centimeter in length and glow much more dimly than the tube lights. They are still in use as small indicator lights. Through the 1970s, neon glow lamps were widely used for numerical displays in electronics, for small decorative lamps, and as signal processing devices in circuity. While these lamps are now antiques, the technology of the neon glow lamp developed into contemporary plasma displays and televisions.|$|E
25|$|Daily {{observations}} of color {{can be related}} to spectroscopy. Neon lighting is a direct application of atomic spectroscopy. Neon and other noble gases have characteristic emission frequencies (colors). <b>Neon</b> <b>lamps</b> use collision of electrons with the gas to excite these emissions. Inks, dyes and paints include chemical compounds selected for their spectral characteristics in order to generate specific colors and hues. A commonly encountered molecular spectrum is that of nitrogen dioxide. Gaseous nitrogen dioxide has a characteristic red absorption feature, and this gives air polluted with nitrogen dioxide a reddish-brown color. Rayleigh scattering is a spectroscopic scattering phenomenon that accounts for the color of the sky.|$|E
25|$|Vactrols {{have been}} used as {{remote-controlled}} resistors for precise ground termination of Beverage and Ewe type antennae. In a typical ham radio setup, the vactrol is placed in the termination box at the farthest point of the antenna. The LDR modifies total resistance between antenna and ground (termination resistance); the operator fine-tunes this resistor from his radio shack by varying the vactrol's LED or bulb current with a potentiometer. Tuning with vactrols improves directional cardioid pattern of the antenna. According to Connelly, vactrols are superior to traditional resistors in this function. In this simple layout, the LED or bulb of the vactrol is prone to damage by voltage surges induced by lightning, and must be protected by a pair of <b>neon</b> <b>lamps</b> acting as gas dischargers.|$|E

50|$|The {{television}} receiver {{would use the}} output of the photoelectric cell to drive a <b>neon</b> <b>lamp.</b> When the photoelectric cell was detecting a bright spot, the <b>neon</b> <b>lamp</b> would be bright. The receiver also had a scanning disk with the same hole-pattern as the camera and it spun at the same speed. The result was a small neon orange image (two inch diagonal) of the remote subject.|$|R
2500|$|Although some <b>neon</b> <b>lamps</b> {{themselves}} are now antiques, {{and their use}} in electronics has declined markedly, the technology has continued to develop in artistic and entertainment contexts. [...] Neon lighting technology has been reshaped from long tubes into thin flat panels used for plasma displays and plasma television sets.|$|E
2500|$|Atoms emit {{and absorb}} light at {{characteristic}} energies. This produces [...] "emission lines" [...] in {{the spectrum of}} each atom. Emission can be spontaneous, as in light-emitting diodes, gas discharge lamps (such as <b>neon</b> <b>lamps</b> and neon signs, mercury-vapor lamps, etc.), and flames (light from the hot gas itselfâ€”so, for example, sodium in a gas flame emits characteristic yellow light). Emission can also be stimulated, as in a laser or a microwave maser.|$|E
2500|$|The {{small size}} of the {{negative}} glow region of a neon lamp, and the flexible electronic properties that were exploited in electronic circuits, led {{to the adoption of}} this technology for the earliest plasma panel displays. The first monochrome dot matrix plasma panel displays were developed in 1964 at the University of Illinois for the PLATO educational computing system. They had the characteristic color of the neon lamp; their inventors, Donald L. Bitzer, H. Gene Slottow, and Robert H. Wilson, had achieved a working computer display that remembered its own state, and did not require constant refreshing from the central computer system. The relationship between these early monochrome displays and contemporary, color plasma displays and televisions was described by Larry F. Weber in 2006, [...] "All plasma TVs on the market today have the same features that were demonstrated in the first plasma display which was a device with only a single cell. These features include alternating sustain voltage, dielectric layer, wall charge, and a neon-based gas mixture." [...] As in colored <b>neon</b> <b>lamps,</b> plasma displays use a gas mixture that emits ultraviolet light. Each pixel has a phosphor that emits one of the display's base colors.|$|E

Notable later uses included the 1998 Lincoln Mark VIII with a neon tube spanning {{the width of}} the trunk decklid, and the BMW Z8, which made extensive use of neon. Concept cars such as those from Volvo have included <b>neon</b> <b>lamp</b> features. Hella offered an aftermarket neon CHMSL in the late 1990s.|$|R

50|$|The {{breakdown}} {{feature of}} <b>neon</b> <b>lamps</b> {{allows them to}} be used as very simple voltage regulators or overvoltage protection devices. In the 1960s General Electric (GE), Signalite, and other firms made special extra-stable <b>neon</b> <b>lamps</b> for electronic uses.|$|E
50|$|Cold-cathode lamps include cold-cathode {{fluorescent}} lamps (CCFLs) and <b>neon</b> <b>lamps.</b> <b>Neon</b> <b>lamps</b> primarily rely on excitation of gas molecules to emit light; CCFLs use a discharge in mercury vapor to develop ultraviolet light, {{which in turn}} causes a fluorescent coating {{on the inside of}} the lamp to emit visible light.|$|E
50|$|Once the <b>neon</b> <b>lamp</b> {{has reached}} breakdown, it can support a large current flow. Because of this characteristic, {{electrical}} circuitry {{external to the}} <b>neon</b> <b>lamp</b> must limit the current through the circuit or else the current will rapidly increase until the lamp is destroyed. For indicator-sized lamps, a resistor typically limits the current. In contrast, larger sized lamps often use a specially constructed high voltage transformer with high leakage inductance or other electrical ballast to limit the available current (see neon sign).|$|R
