5|$|The {{traditional}} family {{structure in the}} United States is considered a family support system involving two married individuals providing care and stability for their biological offspring. However, this two-parent, <b>nuclear</b> <b>family</b> has become less prevalent, and alternative family forms have become more common.

Limited archaeological evidence indicates that throughout Northern Britain, farming was done on single homesteads or amongst a small cluster of three or four homes. Each of these probably contained a <b>nuclear</b> <b>family,</b> with kinship relationships likely to be common among neighbouring houses and settlements, reflecting the partition of land through inheritance. A system was adopted that distinguished between the infield, around the settlement, where crops were grown every year, and the outfield, further away, where crops were grown and then left fallow in different years.

40|$|Abstract Background The Wnt/beta-catenin {{signaling}} pathway {{plays an important}} role in skeletal development. Polymorphisms of frizzled-related protein (FRZB), an antagonist of this pathway, may generate variations in bone mineral density (BMD). In this study, we analyzed the association between FRZB genotypes and peak BMD variation in the spines and hips of two relatively large samples of Chinese female-offspring and male-offspring <b>nuclear</b> <b>families.</b> Methods We recruited 1, 260 subjects from 401 female-offspring <b>nuclear</b> <b>families</b> and 1, 296 subjects from 427 male-offspring <b>nuclear</b> <b>families</b> and genotyped four tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) (rs 6433993, rs 409238, rs 288324, and rs 4666865) spanning the entire FRZB gene. The SNPs rs 288326 and rs 7775, which are associated with hip osteoarthritis, were not selected in this study because of their low minor allele frequencies (MAFs) in Chinese people. The quantitative transmission disequilibrium test (QTDT) was used to analyze the association between each SNP and haplotype with peak BMD in female- and male-offspring <b>nuclear</b> <b>families.</b> Results In the female-offspring <b>nuclear</b> <b>families,</b> we found no evidence of an association between either single SNPs or haplotypes and peak BMD in the spine or hip. In the male-offspring <b>nuclear</b> <b>families,</b> no within-family association was observed for either SNPs or haplotypes, although a significant total association was found between rs 4666865 and spine BMD (P = 0. 0299). Conclusion Our results suggest that natural variation in FRZB is not a major contributor to the observed variability in peak BMD in either Chinese females or males. Because ethnic differences in the FRZB genotypes may exist, other studies in different population are required to confirm such results. </p...|$|R

5|$|The Spanish conquest {{stripped}} away {{most of the}} defining features of Maya civilization. However, many Maya villages remained remote from Spanish colonial authority, {{and for the most}} part continued to manage their own affairs. Maya communities and the <b>nuclear</b> <b>family</b> maintained their traditional day-to-day life. The basic Mesoamerican diet of maize and beans continued, although agricultural output was improved by the introduction of steel tools. Traditional crafts such as weaving, ceramics, and basketry continued to be practised. Community markets and trade in local products continued long after the conquest. At times, the colonial administration encouraged the traditional economy in order to extract tribute in the form of ceramics or cotton textiles, although these were usually made to European specifications. Maya beliefs and language proved resistant to change, despite vigorous efforts by Catholic missionaries. The 260-day tzolk'in ritual calendar continues in use in modern Maya communities in the highlands of Guatemala and Chiapas, and millions of Mayan-language speakers inhabit the territory in which their ancestors developed their civilization.|$|E

5|$|The typical Han-era Chinese {{household}} {{contained a}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>family</b> {{with an average}} of four to five members, unlike in later dynasties when multiple generations and extended family members commonly lived in the same household. Families were patrilineal, which made the father the supreme head of the house. Arranged marriages were the norm, while a new wife was expected to join the clan of her husband. Having sons over daughters was considered extremely important for the sake of carrying on ancestor worship. Although girls and women were expected by custom and Confucian tradition to behave passively towards their male relatives, mothers were given a familial status above that of their sons. Women also engaged in various professions in and outside of the home and were given protection under the law. The empress was superior in status to the male relatives of her consort clan, while the mother of the emperor—the empress dowager—had the authority to override his decisions and choose his successor (if one had not been appointed before his death).|$|E
5|$|Chinese kinship {{relations}} {{during the}} Han {{were influenced by}} Confucian mores and involved both immediate <b>nuclear</b> <b>family</b> and extended family members. The Chinese family was patrilineal, since a father's sons did not consider a mother's kin {{to be part of}} their clan; instead, they were considered 'outside relatives'. The Han dynasty law code inherited the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE) law that any family with more than two sons had to pay extra taxes. This was not repealed until the Cao Wei period (220–265 CE). The average Han family under one household typically had about four or five immediate family members, which was unlike the large extended families under one household in later dynasties. It was common during Han to send adult married sons away with a portion of the family fortune and visit them occasionally, yet in all dynasties during and after the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE), a son who moved away and lived separately from his living parents would be considered a criminal. Larger families appeared during the Eastern Han when some married brothers chose to live with each other's families. However, a household with three generations living under its roof was incredibly rare. This is in contrast to the Jin dynasty (265–420), when having three or more generations under one roof was commonplace.|$|E

40|$|Parent-of-origin {{effects are}} {{important}} in studying genetic traits. More than 1 % of all mammalian genes are believed to show parent-of-origin effects. Some statistical methods may be ineffective or fail to detect linkage or association for a gene with parent-of-origin effects. Based on case-parents trios, the parental-asymmetry test (PAT) is simple and powerful in detecting parent-of-origin effects. However, it is common in practice to collect <b>nuclear</b> <b>families</b> with both parents as well as <b>nuclear</b> <b>families</b> with only one parent. In this paper, when only one parent is available for each family with an arbitrary number of affected children, we firstly develop a new test statistic 1 -PAT to test for parent-of-origin effects {{in the presence of}} association between an allele at the marker locus under study and a disease gene. Then we extend the PAT to accommodate complete <b>nuclear</b> <b>families</b> each with one or more affected children. Combining families with both parents and families with only one parent, the C-PAT is proposed to detect parent-of-origin effects. The validity of the test statistics is verified by simulation in various scenarios of parameter values. A power study shows that using the additional information from incomplete <b>nuclear</b> <b>families</b> in the analysis greatly improves the power of the tests, compared to that based on only complete <b>nuclear</b> <b>families.</b> Also, utilizing all affected children in each family, the proposed tests have a higher power than when only one affected child from each family is selected. Additional power comparison also demonstrates that the C-PAT is more powerful than a number of other tests for detecting parent-of-origin effects. Copyright © 2008 S.

5|$|During {{this period}} greater {{emphasis}} was laid upon {{the civil service}} system of recruiting officials; this was based upon degrees acquired through competitive examinations, {{in an effort to}} select the most capable individuals for governance. Selecting men for office through proven merit was an ancient idea in China. The civil service system became institutionalized on a small scale during the Sui and Tang dynasties, but by the Song period it became virtually the only means for drafting officials into the government. The advent of widespread printing helped to widely circulate Confucian teachings and to educate more and more eligible candidates for the exams. This {{can be seen in the}} number of exam takers for the low-level prefectural exams rising from 30,000 annual candidates in the early 11th century to 400,000 candidates by the late 13th century. The civil service and examination system allowed for greater meritocracy, social mobility, and equality in competition for those wishing to attain an official seat in government. Using statistics gathered by the Song state, Edward A. Kracke, Sudō Yoshiyuki, and Ho Ping-ti supported the hypothesis that simply having a father, grandfather, or great-grandfather who had served as an official of state did not guarantee one would obtain the same level of authority. Robert Hartwell and Robert P. Hymes criticized this model, stating that it places too much emphasis on the role of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>family</b> and considers only three paternal ascendants of exam candidates while ignoring the demographic reality of Song China, the significant proportion of males in each generation that had no surviving sons, and the role of the extended family. Many felt disenfranchised by what they saw as a bureaucratic system that favored the land-holding class able to afford the best education. One of the greatest literary critics of this was the official and famous poet Su Shi. Yet Su was a product of his times, as the identity, habits, and attitudes of the scholar-official had become less aristocratic and more bureaucratic with the transition of the periods from Tang to Song. At the beginning of the dynasty, government posts were disproportionately held by two elite social groups: a founding elite who had ties with the founding emperor and a semi-hereditary professional elite who used long-held clan status, family connections, and marriage alliances to secure appointments. By the late 11th century, the founding elite became obsolete, while political partisanship and factionalism at court undermined the marriage strategies of the professional elite, which dissolved as a distinguishable social group and was replaced by a multitude of gentry families.|$|E
