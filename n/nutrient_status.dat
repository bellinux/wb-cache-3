Chapter 2 compared porewater methylmercury and ancillary chemistry across two Northern Ontario fens. The lower water table, greater dissolved organic carbon, and lower pH in the poor fen resulted in 3. 1 times greater methylmercury. Chapter 3, riparian zones in intermediate fen were evaluated to see if groundwater nutrient supply controlled methylmercury production and transport. Rather than groundwater supply, riparian zones with lower and greater water table fluctuations resulted in greater available sulphate and enhanced methylmercury.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the effect of different fertilizing and farming systems in annual medic (Medicago scutellata ‘Robinson’) on soil organic matter and <b>nutrients</b> <b>status.</b> Fertilizing systems consisted of control (no fertilizer), chemical fertilizer, biological fertilizer and integrated fertilizers (different combinations of chemical and biological fertilizing systems). The farming systems included irrigated and dry-farming systems. The {{experiment was}} conducted in two experimental sites with diverse climatic and soil conditions in Kermanshah province, Iran, during 2009 growing season. The highest amount of soil organic matter of 1. 28  % was observed in integrated fertilizing system of nitrogen-fixing bacteria + phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria. Most of the nitrogen applied through chemical fertilizers was leached out of the plant access, however, application of integrated fertilizer resulted in increasing the concentration of nitrogen in soil because of its slow release and efficient utilization by plants. According {{to the results of}} this study it was concluded that the integrated fertilizing system was more successful in dry farming compared to other fertilizing systems. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{greenhouse}} {{experiment was}} conducted to assess the influence of rooting medium application of phosphorus on mineral <b>nutrients</b> <b>status</b> of rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants under normal or saline conditions. There were four levels (control, 20, 40 and 60 mmol kg- 1) of NaCl and three levels of phosphorus (control, 30 and 60 mg kg- 1) applied through rooting medium. Imposition of varying levels of salt stress markedly decreased the plant fresh and dry biomasses due to increase in the leaf, and root Na+, and Cl- concentrations. In contrast, {{a significant reduction in}} the leaf and root K+, Ca 2 + and root P was also observed in the rice plants. A non-significant effect of salt stress was observed on leaf P, and grain Cl-, K+, Ca 2 + and P concentrations. Maximum increase or decrease in these nutrients was observed at 60 mmol NaCl/kg. Different levels of phosphorus applied through rooting medium inhibit the accumulation of Na+ and Cl- in leaf and roots, while enhance the leaf and root K+, P along with Ca 2 +. Among all levels, 60 mg kg- 1 of phosphorous was observed most effective in relation to these nutrients studied in rice plants...|$|R
30|$|There {{are also}} {{significant}} differences in the <b>nutrient</b> supply <b>status.</b> These differences are, however, small in relation to the differences found in the other landscape attributes and are not stressed here. Both in the Reinhardswald and in the Kellerwald-Edersee National Park, 93  % of the forest sites are classified as mesotrophic.

30|$|Firstly, {{the forest}} site survey data were {{evaluated}} {{in order to}} compare the average water and <b>nutrient</b> supply <b>status</b> of the whole study areas with the water and <b>nutrient</b> supply <b>status</b> at the charcoal kiln sites. Concerning the water supply status, we found significant differences when conducting these comparisons. In the Reinhardswald, most of the charcoal kiln sites are located both on fresh (57  %) and markedly fresh (26  %) soils, while fresh (49  %) and markedly fresh (14  %) soils are much less common throughout the whole Reinhardswald area. On the contrary, periodically moist soils, which occupy 23  % of the whole Reinhardswald area, are significantly under-represented at charcoal kiln sites with a portion of 6  %. Comparable patterns {{were found in the}} Kellerwald-Edersee National Park, where fresh (30  %) and particularly fresh (13  %) soils are significantly over-represented at charcoal kiln sites. Throughout the whole National Park area, these water supply statuses account for 18 and 6  %, respectively. Moderately fresh (42  %) and moderately dry (11  %) soils are also relatively common at charcoal kiln sites. However, compared to the whole area of the National Park, where these water supply statuses account for 47 and 25  %, they are under-represented at charcoal kiln sites.|$|R

50|$|Because the {{nutrient}} holding capacity is low, soil tests are crucial for sand-based athletic fields. Soil tests {{should be taken}} frequently to measure what nutrients are lacking.

Unlike a native soil field, where most nutrients that are applied stay in the soil, sand-based fields <b>nutrient</b> <b>status</b> fluctuates. That is why a yearly fertilizer program can not be followed. It is more important to obtain soil tests during the establishment of a new field because organic matter will be low and amounts of nutrients will fluctuate even more.|$|E
50|$|The {{common alder}} {{is used as}} a pioneer species and to {{stabilise}} river banks, to assist in flood control, to purify water in waterlogged soils and to moderate the temperature and <b>nutrient</b> <b>status</b> of water bodies. It can be grown by itself or in mixed species plantations, and the nitrogen-rich leaves falling to the ground enrich the soil and increase the production of such trees as walnut, Douglas fir and poplar on poor quality soils.

40|$|Quaking aspen is a clonal {{species that}} can produce suckers {{throughout}} its life cycle, resulting in multiple-age classes within a clone. Although each ramet in a clone is genetically identical, we hypothesize that there is physiological variation between the different age classes of the clone. This variation leads to phenotypic diversity, which may increase clonal fitness in response to selection forces. We conducted a study in seven pure aspen clones with 10 identifiable age classes that ranged from first year suckers to overstory trees 3 ̆e 150 years old. We measured specific leaf area, leaf defense chemistry (tannins and phenolic glycosides), carbohydrate and leaf <b>nutrients</b> <b>status,</b> stem water potential and leaf photosynthesis. Each tree was aged by coring and then counting annual rings and clonal relationships were confirmed using microsatellite marker analysis. Phenolic glycosides decreased linearly with age, while condensed tannins increased. Photosynthesis and stem water potential declined markedly after age 40. The data suggests that aspen switch their defense strategy from resistance to tolerance once they grow above the mammal browse line, which may allow them to re-allocate resources from defense to growth. Reductions in photosynthesis and leaf water potential as clones age, may result in greater sensitivity to abiotic and biotic stresses...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} Jatropha curcas L. {{has emerged as}} a biofuel crop with {{potential}} for its production in marginal land with application of treated sewage water. Since this is a new crop for its profitable cultivation, additional research is needed to develop optimal management programs, including macro and micronutrients applications. A pot experiment was conducted in a Greenhouse at the National Research Center, Dokki, Cairo, Egypt, during 2010 summer to evaluate effects of varying concentrations of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn) in irrigation water (0, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 ppm) on the growth, biomass production, photosynthetic pigments, and mineral <b>nutrients</b> <b>status</b> in the plants. Increasing concentrations of Fe, Mn, and Zn in irrigation water up to 150 ppm increased the biomass weight, photosynthetic pigments, and nutrient uptake by Jatropha plants. Further increase in concentrations of micronutrients showed negative effects on the above response parameters. Therefore, this study demonstrates that Jatropha can be grown under irrigation using waste water containing reasonable concentrations of micronutrients and heavy metals. This property of Jatropha provides some support for potential use of this crop for phytoremediation of metal contaminated soils. However, long term field research is needed to further verify both the above beneficial effects...|$|R
50|$|Reed beds vary in {{the species}} that they can support, {{depending}} upon water levels within the wetland system, climate, seasonal variations, and the <b>nutrient</b> <b>status</b> and salinity of the water.

Reed fens have water levels at or below the surface during the summer and are often more botanically complex. Reeds and similar plants do not generally grow in very acidic water; so, in these situations, reed beds are replaced by bogs and vegetation such as poor fen.|$|E

50|$|Different {{parts of}} the root are {{associated}} with different microbial communities.

Additionally different plant species, and even different cultivars, harbor different microbial communities, probably due to host specific immune responses and differences in carbon root exudates.
