500|$|An {{alternative}} ending {{was made}} for the special which was never broadcast, but was put as an extra on the DVD. In {{this version of the}} ending, when Mac sees Caroline floating away, he runs down the stairs and out of the castle to save her. Caroline begins to descend, and both Mac and Guy grab hold of one her legs to bring her down, but instead they are lifted into the air with her. While the three fly away Caroline exclaims [...] "We're all going to die!", to which Mac quite sternly says [...] "Caroline, there's something I've been meaning to tell you", opening the possibility that Mac is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die.</b> Meanwhile, Alan and Joanna, after walking into the sea, are last seen hanging onto a buoy waiting to drown. They are still talking and waiting for the ocean to drown them.|$|E

60|$|But {{on looking}} at {{the man on the}} ground, he saw that he was an African like himself, and in a moment he {{recognized}} him as one of his fellow-slaves, with whom he had worked in Guiana, and also for a short time on the Panama Canal. This made him think that perhaps he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> and he went up to the other man and spoke to him. Then the other man thought perhaps he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> and he sat up and spoke.|$|E
5000|$|However {{he failed}} a medical examination, so {{he wrote to}} John Kerr, the Chief Secretary of Bengal, saying"...all I had {{to do in the}} ICS is to live in the country, so I {{would like to know what}} I am <b>to</b> <b>die</b> of and how soon, and could I now go to the War." [...] John Kerr sent for him and after seeing that he was <b>not</b> {{immediately}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> ordered a medical re-examination which he passed.|$|R

5000|$|Again {{something}} {{written before}} Tommy {{had actually been}} formed as a total idea, and that particular song wasn't about Tommy's devotees at all. It was about the rabble in general, how we, myself as part of them, were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take fascism, were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take dreary, <b>dying</b> politics; were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take {{things the way they}} were, the way they always had been and that we were keen to change things."

5000|$|Osterhaus {{has been}} criticised {{for what has}} been {{described}} as a 'fear campaign', for exaggerating the consequences of the 2009 flu pandemic and pushing for extensive measures, even though the pandemic influenza (H1N1) is now treated as if it were a common flu. Physician and microbiologist Miquel Ekkelenkamp called Osterhaus a 'scaremonger' in an opinion piece in nrc.next and said: [...] "'Expert' Osterhaus should be banned indefinitely from television. Everything he claimed turned out to be untrue: we're <b>not</b> all <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> like we did in 1918, not everyone needs a vaccination, we are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> give Tamiflu to everyone and the virus has not mutated into something much more dangerous." [...] Osterhaus claimed he has not exaggerated the risks. During debate 'De Kwestie live' he said [...] "I have named a wide spectrum of possibilities and minister Ab Klink decided to go for the worst-case scenario" ...|$|R

Already Tony, Hastings and I {{have agreed to}} return to Paris. There are one or two hidden places {{in and around the}} city known only to Percy and {{to the members of the}} League where he must find one or more of us if he succeeds in getting away. All the way between Paris and Calais we have places of refuge, places where any of us can hide at a given moment; where we can find disguises when we want them, or horses in an emergency. No! no! we are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> despair, Lady Blakeney; there are {{nineteen}} of us prepared to lay down our lives for the Scarlet Pimpernel. Already I, as his lieutenant, have been selected as the leader of as determined a gang as has ever entered on a work of rescue before. We leave for Paris to-morrow, and if human pluck and devotion can destroy mountains then we'll destroy them. Our watchword is: 'God save the Scarlet Pimpernel.'" ...|$|R
