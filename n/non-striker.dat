25|$|The Spirit of Cricket, {{which is}} a {{preamble}} to the Laws, lists a series of behaviours considered by the cricket community to be unsporting or contrary to the Spirit of the Game, but dismissing the <b>non-striker</b> whilst backing up is not mentioned.|$|E
25|$|A {{method of}} {{dismissal}} in indoor cricket {{that is far}} more prevalent than its outdoor counterpart is the mankad. A mankad is given out if the bowler completes their bowling action without releasing the ball, breaks the stumps at their end without {{letting go of the}} ball and the <b>non-striker</b> is out of their ground.|$|E
50|$|Tension persisted between strikers and <b>non-strikers.</b> Some of the {{officers}} who did not strike opposed amnesty for those who did.|$|R
25|$|A run out cannot {{occur if}} no fielder has touched the ball. As such, if a batsman plays a {{straight}} drive which breaks the <b>non-striker's</b> stumps whilst he is outside his crease, {{he is not}} out. However, if a fielder (usually the bowler, in this case) touches the ball at all before it breaks the stumps at the <b>non-striker's</b> end, then it is a run out, even if the fielder never has any control of the ball.|$|R
25|$|After 40 days of strike action, {{the union}} called {{an end to}} the dispute, having secured {{promises}} of a pay deal of 9.8 percent for all workers including <b>non-strikers</b> and improved working conditions.|$|R
25|$|Law 37: Obstructing the field. If a batsman {{wilfully}} obstructs {{the opposition}} by word or action or strikes {{the ball with}} a hand not holding the bat, he is out. If {{the actions of the}} <b>non-striker</b> prevent a catch taking place, then the striker is out. Handled the Ball was previously a method of dismissal in its own right.|$|E
25|$|Abid was the <b>non-striker</b> when Sunil Gavaskar {{scored the}} winning runs against the West Indies in the Port of Spain Test of 1971. When West Indies tried to chase a {{difficult}} {{target in the}} final Test of the series, Abid bowled Rohan Kanhai and Garry Sobers in consecutive balls. A few months later, he hit the winning boundary when India defeated England by four wickets at the Oval.|$|E
25|$|During an innings {{two members}} of the batting side are on the pitch at any time: the one facing the current {{delivery}} from the bowler is denoted the striker, while the other is the <b>non-striker.</b> When a batsman is out, he is replaced by a teammate. This continues {{until the end of the}} innings or until 10 of the team members are out, where upon the other team gets a turn to bat.|$|E
50|$|On January 30, 2017 tailender Josh Hazlewood (Aus) {{became the}} first player to be {{dismissed}} for a diamond duck in a partnership of more than fifty runs. He was run out at the <b>non-striker's</b> end without facing a delivery.|$|R
5000|$|As I {{stood at}} the <b>non-striker's</b> end, I felt a wave of admiration for my partner; wiry, slight, dedicated, a lonely man doing a lonely job all these years. - Mike Brearleyadmiring Boycott's talent with the bat in 1979.|$|R
25|$|When a ball {{is being}} bowled, one umpire (the bowler's end umpire) stands behind the stumps at the <b>non-striker's</b> end (that is, the end {{from which the}} ball is being bowled), which gives him a view {{straight}} down the pitch.|$|R
25|$|West Indies beat India 5–0 at home next year, and in 1963, {{they beat}} a fine English team by three matches to one. The Lord's Test {{of this series}} saw a famous finish. With two balls left, England needed six runs to win, and West Indies one wicket. The <b>non-striker</b> was Colin Cowdrey, who had his left arm in a sling, having {{fractured}} it earlier in the day. However, David Allen safely played out the last two balls and the match ended in a draw. Worrell retired {{at the end of}} the series. The selectors picked Garry Sobers to succeed him.|$|E
25|$|In all matches played {{under the}} Laws of cricket with no {{augmented}} playing conditions, the bowler may, {{after he has}} started his run up, but before he would normally {{have been expected to}} release the ball, attempt to run out a <b>non-striker</b> who has strayed outside his crease, with no warning mentioned. If the fielding side appeal the umpire will give the batsman out run out Under Law 41.16. The previous Laws were more restrictive as to when a bowler could attempt this, but they still allowed an attempt up until a bowler entered his delivery stride, which differed from the international game.|$|E
25|$|The most {{involved}} hat-trick {{was perhaps}} when Melbourne club cricketer Stephen Hickman, playing for Power House, achieved a hat-trick spread over three overs, two days, two innings, involving the same batsman twice, and observed {{by the same}} <b>non-striker,</b> with the hat-trick ball being bowled from the opposite end to the first two. In the Mercantile Cricket Association C Grade semi-final at Fawkner Park South Yarra in Melbourne, Gunbower United Cricket Club were 8 for 109 when Hickman came on to bowl his off spin. He took a wicket with the last ball of his third over and then bowled number 11 batsman Richard Higgins with the first ball of his next over to complete the Gunbower innings, leaving Chris Taylor the not out batsman. Power House scored 361 putting the game {{out of reach of}} Gunbower. In the second innings opener Taylor was joined by Higgins at the fall of the fourth wicket as Hickman returned to the attack. With his first ball, observed by an incredulous Taylor at the non-striker's end, he clean bowled Higgins leaving Higgins with a pair of golden ducks.|$|E
2500|$|On January 30, 2017 tailender Josh Hazlewood (Aus) {{became the}} first player to be {{dismissed}} for a diamond duck [...] in a partnership of more than fifty runs. He was run out at the <b>non-striker's</b> end without facing a delivery.|$|R
50|$|When a ball {{is being}} bowled, one umpire (the bowler's end umpire) stands behind the stumps at the <b>non-striker's</b> end (that is, the end {{from which the}} ball is being bowled), which gives him a view {{straight}} down the pitch.|$|R
50|$|The stranglehold was claustrophobic: soon Gower edged one off Amarnath to Syed Kirmani; Lamb {{hung around}} before {{he tried to}} sweep one from Azad, and Yashpal Sharma’s direct hit at the <b>non-striker’s</b> end found him short; and Amarnath jagged one back to uproot Gatting’s leg-stump.|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} the powerplay overs, Taibu {{brought on}} his spinners Gavin Ewing and Prosper Utseya, and the two {{frustrated}} the Indian batsmen, only giving up eight runs in four overs. With the required run rate ballooning, India needed singles, and Keith Dabengwa could run out the <b>non-striker</b> Venugopal Rao with a direct hit as Rao attempted the single while Yuvraj stood his ground. Dhoni, coming in at seven, kept his head cool against the spinners in the remaining overs, though, as he was tied down by Sean Williams and Dabengwa. However, in the 39th over he unleashed himself, taking a six and a four off Sean Williams as he quickly moved to 42. Yuvraj also hit plenty of runs, as the Zimbabwean seamers were smashed around the ground, and his 120 eventually secured victory – even though he was caught by Dabengwa off Blignaut. It didn't matter. India needed six from the last three overs, but only hit one off the third to last, before Dhoni got to face Mahwire and promptly smashed the last ball for six to win the game for India.|$|E
25|$|Included in that haul {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous caughts-and-bowled ever taken. Ulyett sent down a {{straight}} half-volley to Bonnor, who drove at it with all his considerable might and got it right out of the middle of the bat. The ball flew back towards the bowler with a resounding crack. It seemed to Ulyett barely to have left his hand—yet already it was flying back to him at what seemed like the speed of light. He had no time to judge it but held out the right hand instinctively, and the leather stuck, right in the middle of his palm. With the sound of Bonnor's stroke still echoing about the ground, many eyes in the gallery were looking for the area near the boundary where they thought that the ball would land. The eyes of George Giffen, the <b>non-striker,</b> were among the wanderers, and he was certain that everyone else must be looking for it, too: indeed, a segment of the crowd, in panic, had even opened up a space in the ring in anticipation of the ball’s descent. Giffen reckoned it to have been a very mighty drive indeed—but he could not see where it had gone. When, finally, his and other eyes were diverted back towards the pitch, they noticed Ulyett celebrating and Bonnor was departing. It soon dawned on them that Ulyett had taken the catch. Although Ulyett felt no pain in the centre of his hand, there was definitely a fair amount of it on the outside. Bonnor looked at him disgustedly, thinking it almost immoral to have done such a thing, and he walked off gloomily. The England players gathered around Ulyett in wonderment. They seemed to the Wisden correspondent to be curious as to what kind of man this was—although they were also keen to congratulate him on his evasion of impending danger. The looks on the faces of Allan Steel and Alfred Lyttelton would stay with Wisdens man for a long time. WG Grace and Lord Harris both told Ulyett that he was foolish to have attempted to take the catch: had it hit his wrist or arm instead, that bone would surely have snapped. Giffen believed that this {{was one of the}} finest catches that he had ever seen, and, although on the team which it had adversely affected, he definitely appreciated it.|$|E
500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1902–03, Bosanquet took part in another tour, this time with Lord Hawke's team which played matches in New Zealand and Australia and was captained by Warner. In New Zealand, he played two matches against a New Zealand {{representative}} side, and in all matches scored 148 runs {{at an average of}} 18.50 with one fifty, an innings of 82 against South Island. Bosanquet also took 18 wickets at an average of 22.61; his style of bowling attracted a great deal of attention. [...] In one game, Charles Bannerman, who played in Australia's first Test match in 1877, was umpire. He told Warner: [...] "When the next team goes to Australia, be sure that Mr Bosanquet is in it. He bowls a lot of bad 'uns; but that ball of his that breaks the wrong way will be very useful on the hard Australian wickets." [...] However, the tour was more notable for an incident in the match against Canterbury. Bosanquet had taken an early wicket in the first innings, but bowled poorly afterwards. He was the fourth bowler used in the second innings and with his third ball, it {{looked as if he had}} bowled Walter Pearce behind his legs as he attempted a big hit. However, both umpires were unsighted and the <b>non-striker</b> Arthur Sims, who also had his view obscured, urged Pearce not to leave the middle. The tourists' wicket-keeper, Arthur Whatman, Bosanquet and other English players surrounded the umpire, who decided Pearce was not out. Bosanquet then turned to Sims and said: [...] "You're a nice cheat. I bowled him round his legs. Anybody could see that." [...] Sims responded that there was reasonable doubt, but Whatman began to swear and call him a cheat. Bosanquet later bowled Sims and Canterbury were easily defeated. However, the incident continued to attract attention. The English team were severely criticised in the press and Sims' employers refused to release him for any further matches unless Bosanquet apologised. Bosanquet wrote letters of apology to Sims and to the Canterbury Cricket Association, and Sims later told him to forget about it, but Sims' employers would not let him take part in the remaining games.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to 2013, Finn had a {{frequent}} habit of knocking over the <b>non-striker's</b> stumps with his knee during his delivery. This ultimately caused controversy during the 2012 South Africa tour of England: after the South African batsmen complained of being distracted, the umpire {{decided to use}} a provision within the Laws to call a dead ball whenever Finn broke the stumps – with the first such call negating a wicket-taking delivery. In 2013, Finn changed his run-up to correct the problem; and, the ICC introduced a new law to declare a delivery a no ball, rather than a dead ball, if the <b>non-striker's</b> wicket is broken {{in the act of}} delivery – a regulation now commonly known as [...] "Finn's Law".|$|R
25|$|A batsman who is {{dismissed}} without {{facing a}} ball (most usually run {{out from the}} <b>non-striker's</b> end, but alternatively stumped or run out off a wide delivery) {{is said to be}} out for a diamond duck, but in some regions that term has an alternative definition.|$|R
25|$|Rationing led {{to violent}} incidents, when truck drivers chose to strike {{for two days}} in December 1973 over the limited {{supplies}} Simon had allocated for their industry. In Pennsylvania and Ohio, non-striking truckers were shot at by striking truckers, and in Arkansas, trucks of <b>non-strikers</b> were attacked with bombs.|$|R
2500|$|... "For {{the life}} of me, I can't {{understand}} why [...] questioned his sportsmanship. The laws of cricket make it quite clear that the <b>non-striker</b> must keep within his ground until the ball has been delivered. If not, why is the provision there which enables the bowler to run him out? By backing up too far or too early, the <b>non-striker</b> is very obviously gaining an unfair advantage." ...|$|E
2500|$|A batsman is not run out if {{the ball}} has not been touched by a fielder, after the bowler has {{delivered}} the ball, before the wicket is put down. (This means that the <b>non-striker</b> is not out if a ball hit by the striker puts down the non-striker's wicket, provided the ball did not touch {{any member of the}} fielding side before doing so.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Laws state that, {{throughout}} an innings, [...] "the ball {{shall be}} bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 balls". The name [...] "over" [...] {{came about because}} the umpire calls [...] "Over!" [...] when six balls have been bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batsmen do not. A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can (and usually does) bowl alternate overs, from the same end, for several overs which are termed a [...] "spell". The batsmen do not change ends {{at the end of}} the over, and so the one who was <b>non-striker</b> is now the striker and vice-versa. The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at [...] "square leg" [...] now stands behind the wicket at the non-striker's end and vice-versa.|$|E
2500|$|The {{series was}} tied 1–1, with New Zealand having {{won the first}} match, and Australia the second. At {{the end of the}} third match, the batsman at the <b>non-striker's</b> end, Bruce Edgar, was on 102 not out, and his innings has been called [...] "the most {{overlooked}} century of all time".|$|R
25|$|He was {{involved}} in a bizarre run-out with Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the third Test against New Zealand in 2006. Morton drove the ball to mid-on where Daniel Vettori was fielding and ran to the non striker end. Chanderpaul, at the other end, initially took a few steps down the wicket but then turned {{and went back to the}} <b>non-striker's</b> end. Morton believed he was out, and, furious at his captain, began to walk off. However, following a call to the third umpire, it was decided that Morton had grounded his bat at the <b>non-striker's</b> end just before Chanderpaul, and hence was safe and that Chanderpaul was out. Video evidence suggests that the umpire's decision was wrong: although Morton made his ground first, he then left it before the run-out was made, so he should have been the one dismissed.|$|R
25|$|From 30 April 2013 (ICC playing regulation) and 1 Oct 2013 (Law) a No ball {{results when}} the bowler breaks the <b>non-striker's</b> wicket during {{the act of}} delivery. For a short period prior to this, umpires had adopted the {{convention}} of calling 'dead ball' when this happened. See Steven Finn for origins of the change.|$|R
2500|$|The {{equivalent}} in cricket {{is almost impossible}} because the bowler is next to the runner, and in fact {{used to be able}} to mankad him if he strayed out of his crease; nowadays the batsman can leave the crease when the bowler's back foot touches the ground during his delivery action without risk of being 'mankaded' (but there have been cases of a <b>non-striker</b> having been run out backing up when a bowler's misfield has hit the stumps). Tactical running in cricket rarely strays beyond the consideration of [...] "can I make it to the other end before the ball does". One exception of this is towards the end of a closely fought limited overs game, where a batsman (normally a tail-ender) would sacrifice his wicket to allow the better batsman to remain on strike, usually in the last few balls. While in baseball, steals, sacrificial running, forces, double plays, intimidation, and physical contact enter into the equation.|$|E
2500|$|A special form of run out is {{when the}} batsman at the non-striker's end {{attempts}} to gain an advantage by leaving the crease before the next ball has been bowled (a common practice known as [...] "backing up", but against the laws of cricket if the <b>non-striker</b> leaves his crease before the bowler has released the ball). The bowler may then dislodge the bails at his/her end without completing the run-up and dismiss the batsman. This form of run-out is called the Mankad (the dismissed batsman {{is said to have}} been [...] "Mankaded"), in reference to Vinoo Mankad, the first bowler to dismiss a batsman in this manner in a Test match, running out Bill Brown in 1947. [...] With changes in the Laws of Cricket, a bowler cannot Mankad a batsman once they reach the point in their delivery where they would normally release the ball. It is considered good etiquette to warn a batsman that he is leaving his crease early, before attempting a Mankad run out on a subsequent ball.|$|E
2500|$|Hurst was an {{athletic}} {{man in the}} outfield who bowled with an elaborate, [...] "winding" [...] delivery stride that generated real pace. He was a terrible batsman, scoring 10 ducks in 20 Test innings. In the 1978-79 Ashes series, he set a record by scoring two pairs. The only truly controversial incident of his career happened in the 1979 Perth test when Alan Hurst ran out Pakistan’s number eleven batsman Sikander Bakht at the bowler's end as Bakht was backing up too far - the fourth such instance in Test cricket. Later in the day, Australian batsman Andrew Hilditch was given out after an appeal for handled the ball and became the only <b>non-striker</b> to have suffered that decision. Hilditch picked up a wayward throw that had dribbled onto the pitch and handed the ball back to Sarfraz Nawaz who appealed and the umpire {{had to give him}} out. This incident was in retaliation for Hurst’s actions. The brief series {{was one of the most}} bad-tempered in history, caused in part by Pakistan’s decision to play their WSC-contracted men.|$|E
2500|$|The feud resurfaced {{during the}} final of the 2016 ICC World Twenty20, during which Samuels scored a crucial 85. Stokes bowled the final over of the match to Carlos Brathwaite, with Samuels at the <b>non-striker's</b> end. After Brathwaite hit 4 sixes to win the game for the West Indies, Samuels claimed that Stokes [...] "never learns".|$|R
50|$|The general {{secretary}} of the PCF, Maurice Thorez, was concerned about the radicalization of the movement, as shown in the reports of SDECEE. Saboteurs activists believed that the train was carrying CRS to support <b>non-strikers</b> from Arras, supported by the Gaullist militants. The government was secretly negotiating with the PCF, exchanging immunity against four activists supporting the resumption of work.|$|R
5|$|Australia took a first innings lead of 134 and Davidson removed Subba Row and Barrington {{with the}} new ball in the second innings to end with 2/50 and help set up a five wicket victory.
