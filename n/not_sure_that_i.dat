500|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] were often {{difficult}} for listeners to decipher, both {{due to their}} nonsensicality and because of Cobain's slurred, guttural singing voice. This problem was {{compounded by the fact}} that the Nevermind album liner notes did not include any lyrics for the songs aside from selected lyrical fragments. This incomprehensibility contributed to the early resistance from radio stations towards adding the song to their playlists; one Geffen promoter recalled that people from rock radio told her, [...] "We can't play this. I can't understand what the guy is saying." [...] MTV went as far as to prepare a version of the video that included the lyrics running across the bottom of the screen, which they aired when the video was added to their heavy rotation schedule. The lyrics for the album—and some from earlier or alternate versions of the songs—were later released with the liner notes of the [...] "Lithium" [...] single in 1992. American rock critic Dave Marsh noted comments by disc jockeys of the time that the song was [...] "the 'Louie Louie' of the nineties" [...] and wrote, [...] "Like 'Louie,' only more so, 'Teen Spirit' reveals its secrets reluctantly and then often incoherently." [...] Marsh, trying to decipher the lyrics of the song, felt after reading the correct lyrics from the song's sheet music that [...] "what I imagined was quite a bit better (at least, more gratifying) than what Nirvana actually sang," [...] and added, [...] "Worst of all, I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> know more about [...] 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' now than before I plunked down for the official version of the facts." ...|$|E

I am all {{the writers}} that I have read, {{all the people}} that I have met, all the women that I have loved; all the cities that I have visited, all my ancestors." [...] As a young man, he visited the frontier pampas which extend beyond Argentina into Uruguay and Brazil. Borges said that his father wished him [...] "to become a citizen of the world, a great cosmopolitan," [...] in the way of Henry and William James. Borges lived and studied in Switzerland and Spain as a young student. As Borges matured, he traveled through Argentina as a lecturer and, internationally, as a visiting professor; he continued to tour the world as he grew older, finally settling in Geneva where he had spent some of his youth. Drawing on the influence of many times and places, Borges's work belittled nationalism and racism. Portraits of diverse coexisting cultures characteristic of Argentina are especially pronounced in the book Six Problems for don Isidoro Parodi (co-authored with Bioy Casares) and Death and the Compass. Borges wrote that he considered Mexican essayist Alfonso Reyes to be [...] "the best prose-writer in the Spanish language of any time." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh! A continuosity? I {{know what}} that is in the {{ordinary}} acceptation of the term, but I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> follow your meaning exactly." ...|$|E
6000|$|Appleby nodded. “It’s Spanish, {{which is}} the same thing. They’re a {{consistent}} people,” he said. “Still, I’m <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> quite catch your meaning.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>not</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{understand}} you," [...] replied Fan, with {{a little}} hesitation. [...] "Do you mean religious, Mr. Travers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{said just}} {{now he was}} vestry-clerk, like his father before him. <b>I</b> am <b>not</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> know what a vestry-clerk is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{absolutely}} needless," [...] replied G--. [...] "I am <b>not</b> more <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> breathe than <b>I</b> am <b>that</b> {{the letter is}} not at the Hotel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{shall have}} time. You know I have been {{intending}} {{to make a}} walking tour through Switzerland before joining at Corfu.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “No,” said Tony, {{and there}} was a trace of anxiety in his glance, “I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do, though I have some {{passable}} friends.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I may be exaggerating to myself," [...] he answered. [...] "But I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{could go}} on with my work without her--not now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't say. I really don't know. It's a very {{important}} step to take at my age, and I'm <b>not</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should be doing wisely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe you}} can, Julian," [...] he admitted. [...] "Sometimes <b>I</b> am <b>not</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{understand}} you. <b>That's</b> {{the worst of}} a man with the gift for silence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> quite <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can," [...] {{he replied}} with a slight laugh. [...] "Its name is as outlandish as itself--gnu, or yak, or perhaps Jamrach." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Really," [...] said Louise, [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{approve of}} this! A supper club with Sophy until half past {{three in the}} morning!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘There’s {{another thing}} yet,’ said Francie, {{stopping}} his father. ‘There’s {{another thing that}} I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am very caring for. She—she sends me errands.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{ask your}} forgiveness; {{it would be}} too much, and I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wish to have it. But I feel that you are generous." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{sergeant}} {{went out}} fuming inwardly, and Coulthurst laughed. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{should have let}} the fellow off," [...] he said. [...] "What made you do it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There again!" [...] she protested. [...] "I am <b>not</b> so <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want to {{be taken}} away from it. I like adventures--I adore excitement; in fact I must have it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Austin {{smiled as}} he looked at him. [...] "To be correct, I'm <b>not</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did," [...] he said, reflectively. [...] "I mean, it wasn't exactly because I wished to." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Stackpole seemed unmoved by this consideration; she was {{thinking}} of something else and presently expressed it. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> understand you about Lord Warburton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You seem to {{have been}} brought into it," [...] her brother {{observed}} grimly, [...] "and I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am satisfied. I can pay my own debts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Glittering Lady is {{all very}} well, but I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> care for a {{glittering}} dog. It doesn't look quite natural," [...] said Bastin, contemplating him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>not</b> so <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{ever really}} {{cared for the}} princess," [...] replied the chief; [...] "but of this <b>I</b> am quite <b>sure,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never loved her {{half as much as}} I love you, Branwen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see what}} you mean," [...] said March, with a dubious glance at the statue, [...] "but I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure,</b> now, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't like {{something}} quieter in my Madonnas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see {{how that}} makes it any better; besides, <b>I</b> am <b>not</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did expect it; at any rate I did not feel certain. There is no doubt now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it's {{all right}} now. Indeed I {{sat at the}} Board yesterday, though I signed the letter afterwards. I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't lose more than I gain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{another thing}} yet," [...] said Francie, {{stopping}} his father. [...] "There's {{another thing that}} I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am very caring for. She--she sends me errands." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That," [...] he said, [...] "would {{certainly}} {{seem to be}} {{your best}} course. On the contrary," [...] he added, [...] "I am <b>not</b> altogether <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am justified in letting you go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see! And yet," [...] he went on, [...] "I am <b>not</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do see. Is {{there any}} radical {{difference}} between marriage and a really intimate friendship {{between a man}} and a woman?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>not</b> so <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do, father. It {{seems to}} me {{something}} like the Irishman's pig which you pull one way when {{you want him to}} go another. However, I'll take your word for it." ...|$|R
