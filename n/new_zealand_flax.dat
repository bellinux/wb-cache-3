5|$|Several {{conservation}} {{measures have been}} undertaken or proposed to protect this species. Inaccessible Island was once suggested as a site for agriculture for Tristan Islanders, which would have reduced habitat and risked the introduction of invasive species. However the island was declared a nature reserve by the Tristan da Cunha Island Council in 1994. Access to the island is restricted now, although Tristan Islanders are still permitted to visit the island to collect firewood and guano. Introduced <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>flax</b> {{has been removed from}} the island, and the island now has a management plan. Other suggestions for securing this species' future include increased education on biosecurity for the local community, and potentially setting up a captive population. It has also been suggested that backup populations be established on other secure islands, for example Nightingale Island, in case predators reached Inaccessible Island, but this may have negative impacts on the endemic invertebrate faunas of these islands.|$|E

40|$|The {{roots of}} a species of <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> native <b>flax,</b> Phonnium tenax and a {{commercial}} herbal preparation of the root were examined for novel or biologically active compounds. The species Phormium tenax has been examined chemically {{in the past and}} has yielded a number of novel and biologically active compounds. Missing from this body of work was an investigation into an aqueous extract of the roots of the plant. The commercial herbal preparation, "Fluid of Flax, Manaaki Huia" was such an extract and from this three novel aromatic glycosides were isolated. The herbal preparation was found to contain one biologically active compound, 1 - 0 -[β- glucopyranosyl-(1  6) -O-β-xylopyranosyl]- 4 -hydroxymusizin. The structure was identified by mass spectrometry and NMR techniques which included HMBC, HSQC, ID TOCSY and nOe enhancements. Two related glycosides, 1 - 0 -[β- glucopyranosyl-(1  6) -O- 6 -deoxy-β-mannopyranosyl]- 4 -hydroxymusizin and 1 - 0 -[β- glucopyranosyl-(1  6) -O- 6 -deoxy-β-mannopyranosyl]-musizin were isolated from a methanol extract directly from the roots of Phormium tenax. Both of these compounds were present as minor components in the herbal preparation. Neither of these glycosides showed any significant bioactivity in the in-house bioassays available...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{examination}} of the commercial, social and political dimensions of the <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> timber and <b>flax</b> trade 1769 - 1840. Chapters One to Three provide a chronological account of the trade. The level of activity was sporadic until 1827 after which time the trade expanded. The years 1769 - 1827 were a period of familiarization. The Europeans needed to experiment wit the <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> products, to test the market for them and to settle traders at <b>New</b> <b>Zealand.</b> The Maoris had to learn what Europeans required and to adjust to the demands of trading. Each group used these years {{to get to know the}} other and to establish the rapport required for the trade to function. Exports of wood and fibre from <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> increased rapidly after 1827 because the Europeans were prepared to invest in them and the Maoris were willing to produce enough timber and flax to sustain an export trade. During the 1830 s the trade prospered only for as long as the markets for the products were buoyant and the Maoris were prepared to continue to assist with the production of them. Timber and flax trading could substantially affect the lives of those involved in it. Chapters Four and Five examine how traders adapted to the demands of the <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> physical and social environment and how Maoris faced changes in their work and settlement patterns, health, inter-tribal relations, and material culture. Chapter Six discusses the increasing interest by British and colonial governments in <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> affairs which was stimulated in large part by the timber and flax trade. For example the sent naval vessels and issued contracts to private firms to collect cargoes of these products. They also sought to regulate affairs in <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> (by passing Acts of Parliament, by sending naval vessels to cruise the coast and by appointing a British Resident) at least partly in order to provide an environment whic would be conducive to trading. The eventual British decision to annex <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> was strongly influenced by the pressure exerted on the government by those who were interested in trading with that country...|$|R

In 1786 the British government included Norfolk Island as an auxiliary settlement, as proposed by John Call, in its plan for colonisation of New South Wales. The decision to settle Norfolk Island was taken due to Empress Catherine II of Russia's decision to restrict sales of hemp. Practically all the hemp and flax required by the Royal Navy for cordage and sailcloth was imported from Russia.|$|E

The beads were of many kinds; some horn cylinders bulging in the centre, and measuring 1.25 inch long; others of flattened clay like the American wampum or the ornaments of the Fernando Po tribes; and others flattened discs, also baked, almost identical with those found upon African mummies--in Peru they were used to record dates and events. A few were of reddish agate, a material not found in the island; these resembled bits of thick pipe-stem, varying from half an inch to an inch in length.
