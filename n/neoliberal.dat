5|$|During the 1996 elections, the BJP shifted its stance {{away from}} {{protectionism}} and towards globalisation; its election manifesto recommended increasing {{foreign investment in}} priority sectors, while restricting it in others. When the party was in power in 1998, it shifted its policy even further in favour of globalisation. The tenure of the NDA saw an unprecedented influx of foreign companies in India. This was criticised by the left parties and the BJP's affiliates (the RSS and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch). The communist parties said that the BJP was attempting to appease the World Bank and the United States government through its <b>neoliberal</b> policies. Similarly, the RSS stated that the BJP was not being true to its swadeshi ideology.|$|E
5|$|In {{her book}} The Shock Doctrine, author and social activist Naomi Klein criticized Friedman's {{economic}} liberalism, identifying {{it with the}} principles that guided the economic restructuring that followed the military coups {{in countries such as}} Chile and Argentina. Based on their assessments {{of the extent to which}} what she describes as <b>neoliberal</b> policies contributed to income disparities and inequality, both Klein and Noam Chomsky have suggested that the primary role of what they describe as neoliberalism was as an ideological cover for capital accumulation by multinational corporations.|$|E
5|$|Some {{branches}} of feminism closely track the political leanings {{of the larger}} society, such as liberalism and conservatism, or focus on the environment. Liberal feminism seeks individualistic equality {{of men and women}} through political and legal reform without altering the structure of society. Catherine Rottenberg has argued that the <b>neoliberal</b> shirt in Liberal feminism has led to that form of feminism being individualized rather than collectivized and becoming detached from social inequality. Due to this she argues that Liberal Feminism cannot offer any sustained analysis of the structures of male dominance, power, or privilege.|$|E
5|$|Morales led {{calls for}} President Sánchez de Lozada {{to step down}} over the death toll, gaining {{widespread}} support from the MAS, other activist groups, and the middle classes; with pressure building, Sánchez resigned and fled to Miami, Florida. He was replaced by Carlos Mesa, who tried {{to strike a balance}} between U.S. and cocalero demands, but whom Morales mistrusted. In November, Morales spent 24 hours with Cuban President Fidel Castro in Havana, and then met Argentinian President Nestor Kirchner. In the 2004 municipal election, the MAS became the country's largest national party, with 28.6% of all councilors in Bolivia. However, they had failed to win the mayoralty in any big cities, reflecting their inability to gain widespread support among the urban middle-classes. In Bolivia's wealthy Santa Cruz region, a strong movement for autonomy had developed under the leadership of the Pro Santa Cruz Committee (Comite Pro Santa Cruz). Favorable to <b>neoliberal</b> economics and strongly critical of the cocaleros, they considered armed insurrection to secede from Bolivia should MAS take power.|$|E
5|$|His fourth {{minister}} of economy, Domingo Cavallo, was appointed in 1991. He deepened the <b>neoliberal</b> reforms. The Convertibility plan was {{sanctioned by the}} Congress, setting a one-to-one fixed exchange rate between the United States dollar and the new Argentine peso, which replaced the Austral. The law also limited public expenditures, but this was frequently ignored. There was increased free trade to reduce inflation, and high taxes on sales and earnings {{to reduce the deficit}} caused by it. Initially, the plan was a success: the capital flights ended, interest and inflation rates were lowered, and economic activity increased. The money from privatizations allowed Argentina to repurchase many of the Brady Bonds issued during the crisis. The privatizations of electricity, water, and gas were more successful than previous ones. YPF, the national oil refinery, was privatized as well, but the state kept {{a good portion of the}} shares. The project to privatize the pension funds was resisted in Congress, and was approved as a mixed system that allowed both public and private options for workers. The national state also signed a fiscal pact with the provinces, so that they reduced their local deficits as well. Buenos Aires Province was helped with a fund that gave the governor a million pesos daily.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner ran for {{governor}} of Santa Cruz in 1991. Although he received only 30 percent of the vote, below the 36 percent of the UCR, he was elected due to the Ley de Lemas that added the votes for the Peronist faction of Puricelli to his own. When Kirchner took office, Santa Cruz was experiencing an economic crisis, with high unemployment and a budget deficit equal to 1.2 billion pesos, which amounted to {{an equal number of}} U.S. dollars because of the Convertibility plan. He expanded the number of provincial Supreme Court justices from three members to five and appointed three judges loyal to him; this gave him control of the provincial judiciary. Kirchner was criticized for preventing the investigation of corruption cases. Santa Cruz received 535 million pesos in oil royalties in 1993, which Kirchner deposited in a foreign bank. He was elected to the Constituent Assembly which drafted the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution proposed by the Peronist president Carlos Menem. Kirchner voted against the amendment that would allow the reelection of the president, which was approved. Locally, he proposed an amendment to the provincial constitution authorizing indefinite reelection of the governor. Menem and Kirchner were reelected to their respective offices in 1995. Kirchner established a faction in the PJ opposing Menem's <b>neoliberal</b> economic policies, but Eduardo Duhalde, governor of the populous Buenos Aires province, ignored him and rallied a stronger opposition to Menem within the PJ.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} policies of Modi's government focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, {{based on a}} <b>neoliberal</b> framework. Modi liberalised India's foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including in defence and the railways. Other reforms included removing many of the country's labour laws, {{to make it harder}} for workers to form unions and easier for employers to hire and fire them. These reforms met with support from institutions such as the World Bank, but opposition from scholars within the country. The labour laws also drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country's largest unions went on strike, including one affiliated with the BJP. The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a constituent of the Sangh Parivar, stated that the reforms would hurt labourers by making it easier for corporations to exploit them. In his first budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley promised to gradually reduce the budgetary deficit from 4.1 percent to 3 percent over two years, and to divest from shares in public banks. Over Modi's first year in office, the Indian GDP grew at a rate of 7.5 percent, making it the world's fastest-growing large economy.|$|E

25|$|Stone {{was interviewed}} in Boris Malagurski's {{documentary}} film The Weight of Chains 2 (2014), {{which deals with}} <b>neoliberal</b> reforms in the Balkans.|$|E
25|$|Neoliberalism rose to {{prominence}} after the 1970s and <b>neoliberal</b> shock therapy became increasingly {{used as a}} response to economic crises, for example by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. <b>Neoliberal</b> shock therapy became very controversial, with its proponents arguing that it helped to end economic crises, stabilise economies and pave the way for growth, while its critics (like Joseph Stiglitz) believed that it helped deepen them unnecessarily and created unnecessary social suffering.|$|E
25|$|However, by 1990 the <b>neoliberal</b> {{government}} of Alberto Fujimori ended abruptly the soviet minded economic policies {{with the so-called}} ´Fuji Shock´of August 7, 1990.|$|E
25|$|The {{costs in}} terms of {{increased}} inequality are prominent. Such costs epitomize the trade-off between the growth and equity effects of {{some aspects of the}} <b>neoliberal</b> agenda.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{inequality}} in turn hurts {{the level and}} sustainability of growth. Even if growth is the sole or main purpose of the <b>neoliberal</b> agenda, advocates of that agenda still {{need to pay attention}} to the distributional effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{term has}} become {{associated}} with <b>neoliberal</b> policies {{in general and}} drawn into the broader debate over the expanding role of the free market, constraints upon the state, and US influence on other countries' national sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|A {{supporter}} of <b>neoliberal</b> economic policy, during the 1990s de Santibañes {{served in the}} board of the University of CEMA (a Buenos Aires business school); and of FIEL, a think tank led by right-wing lawmaker Ricardo López Murphy.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} crisis in the 1990s has been widely cited in the Anglo-American press as a social democratic failure, {{but it is important}} to note not only did profit rates begin to fall worldwide after the 1960s, also this period saw <b>neoliberal</b> ascendance in Social Democratic ideology and policies as well as the rise of bourgeois coalition rule in place of the Social Democrats. 1980s Social Democratic <b>neoliberal</b> measures—such as depressing and deregulating the currency to prop up Swedish exports during the economic restructuring transition, dropping corporate taxation and taxation on high income-earners, and switching from anti-unemployment policies to anti-inflationary policies—were exacerbated by international recession, unchecked currency speculation, and a centre-right government led by Carl Bildt (1991–1994), creating the fiscal crisis of the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The social {{conflicts}} {{of the last}} few years have paralyzed Bolivia's political life. The unpopularity of the <b>neoliberal</b> Washington consensus, a set of economic strategies implemented by Gonzalo de Lozada's administration, {{set the stage for the}} 2006 election of president Evo Morales, the country's first indigenous president.|$|E
25|$|Salinas {{continued}} with the <b>neoliberal</b> economic policy {{of his predecessor}} Miguel de la Madrid and converted Mexico into a regulatory state. During his presidential term, the banking system (that had been nationalized by José López Portillo) was privatized, {{as well as the}} national phone company TELMEX.|$|E
25|$|On 31 March 2016, {{students}} and young workers began occupying public spaces in France {{in opposition to}} the 2016 <b>neoliberal</b> labor reforms in a protest movement known as Nuit debout. As of 8 April, it has spread to dozens of cities in France as well as to Belgium, Germany, and Spain.|$|E
25|$|When the Social Democrats {{returned}} {{to power in}} 1994, they responded to the fiscal crisis by stabilizing the currency—and by reducing the welfare state and privatizing public services and goods, as governments did in many countries influenced by Milton Friedman, the Chicago Schools {{of political and economic}} thought, and the <b>neoliberal</b> movement. Social Democratic Party leaders—including Göran Persson, Mona Sahlin, and Anna Lindh—promoted European Union (E.U.) membership, and the Swedish referendum passed by 52–48% in favor of joining the E.U. on 14 August 1994. Bourgeois leader Lars Leijonborg at his 2007 retirement could recall the 1990s as a golden age of liberalism in which the Social Democrats were under the expanding influence of the Liberal Party and its partners in the bourgeois political coalition. Leijonborg recounted <b>neoliberal</b> victories such as the growth of private schooling and the proliferation of private, for-profit radio and television.|$|E
25|$|Chomsky {{believes}} that these austere and <b>neoliberal</b> measures ensure that poorer countries merely fulfill a service role by providing cheap labor, {{raw materials and}} investment opportunities for the developed world. Additionally, this means that corporations can threaten to relocate to poorer countries, and Chomsky sees this as a powerful weapon to keep workers in richer countries in line.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, the <b>neoliberal</b> {{reforms were}} implemented, {{although}} not all at once: {{by the end of}} 1990, the prices were liberalized and a free currency exchange rate, devaluing the leu by 60%. The land of the state-owned collective farms was distributed to private owners and a list of 708 large state-owned enterprises to be privatized was devised.|$|E
25|$|Mbeki, as an ANC insider {{and while}} president, {{was a major}} force behind the {{continued}} <b>neoliberal</b> structure of the South African economy. He drew criticism from the left for his perceived abandonment of state-interventionist social democratic economic policies, such as nationalisation, land reform, and democratic capital controls, prescribed by the Freedom Charter, the ANC's seminal document.|$|E
25|$|President de la Madrid (1982–88) was {{the first}} of a series of presidents that began to {{implement}} <b>neoliberal</b> reforms. After the crisis of 1982, lenders were unwilling to return to Mexico and, in order to keep the current account in balance, the government resorted to currency devaluations, which in turn sparked unprecedented inflation, which reached a historic high in 1987 at 139.7%.|$|E
25|$|Paz Zamora was a moderate, center-left President whose {{political}} pragmatism {{in office}} outweighed his Marxist origins. Having seen the destructive hyperinflation of the Siles Zuazo administration, he continued the <b>neoliberal</b> economic reforms begun by Paz Estenssoro, codifying some of them. Paz Zamora took a fairly hard line against domestic terrorism, personally ordering the December 1990 attack on terrorists of the Néstor Paz Zamora Committee.|$|E
25|$|Salinas {{embarked}} on a program of <b>neoliberal</b> reforms which fixed the exchange rate, controlled inflation and culminated with {{the signing of the}} North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which came into effect on January 1, 1994. The same day, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) started a two-week-long armed rebellion against the federal government, and has continued as a non-violent opposition movement against neoliberalism and globalization.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{presidency}} of Carlos Menem, Argentina radically changed its economic policies moving from a more Import substitution industrialisation-orientated model towards <b>neoliberal</b> shock therapy and the Washington Consensus {{under the supervision of}} the International Monetary Fund. Much like under the classical liberalism of the late 19th and early 20th century, under these plans, Argentina would sell off most of its state assets at extremely reduced prices, among them the railways.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, {{following}} Quebec's Quiet Revolution, the Progressive Conservatives {{recognized the need}} to increase their appeal to Canada's francophone population. At the same time, the Tories finally began their move away from mercantilism towards a <b>neoliberal</b> platform. Both movements culminated with Brian Mulroney becoming prime minister after the election of 1984. He led the Tories to a record 211 seats, and a majority of seats in every province.|$|E
25|$|The <b>neoliberal</b> {{reforms were}} {{accelerated}} after the Democratic Convention won the 1996 elections, the government using its prerogatives {{to pass a}} package of laws, removing subsidies, passing reforms on unemployment benefits and greatly {{increasing the number of}} privatized companies. Romanian GDP was essentially flat (in US dollars) {{for more than a decade}} after the revolution, but GDP more than quadrupled in the 2000s, once free market reforms had been fully implemented.|$|E
25|$|Yeltsin also sparked popular unrest {{with his}} {{dissolution}} of a parliament increasingly opposed to his <b>neoliberal</b> economic reforms. Tens {{of thousands of}} Russians marched {{in the streets of}} Moscow seeking to bolster the parliamentary cause. The demonstrators were protesting against the deteriorating living conditions. Since 1989, the GDP had been declining, corruption was rampant, violent crime was skyrocketing, medical services were collapsing and life expectancy falling. Yeltsin was also increasingly getting the blame.|$|E
25|$|Reform's {{ambitions of}} {{becoming}} a national party and spreading into the east, particularly into Ontario, were helped {{by the rise of}} Ontario Progressive Conservative Premier Mike Harris to power in 1995. Harris' Common Sense Revolution agenda shared much of Reform's fiscally <b>neoliberal</b> ideology, including deep spending cuts, privatization of social services, and tax cuts. The party continued to show its ties to Harris as a means to diminish support for the federal PC Party.|$|E
25|$|Toledo’s {{economic}} policies {{can be described}} as <b>neoliberal</b> or strongly pro free-trade. He inherited a national economy which in the previous decade had experienced an unstable GDP with periods of growth and shrinkage, as well as fiscal deficits frequently amounting to over 2% of GDP. Inflation had not dropped below 23% until 1995 and was still feared by many. In response, Toledo developed policies which focused on fighting poverty, generating employment, decentralizing government, and modernizing the state.|$|E
25|$|Most direct {{critics have}} {{considered}} Uribe's administration <b>neoliberal,</b> {{and argued that}} it has not addressed the root causes of poverty and unemployment, because continued application of traditional trade and tax policies tend to benefit private and foreign investors over small owners and workers. Union and labor claim that many of the privatizations and liquidations have been done to please the IMF, the World Bank and multinational companies, and will hurt several national industries in the long run.|$|E
25|$|The {{program has}} been immensely popular. President García {{expanded}} the program, which has been praised by <b>neoliberal</b> reformers for extending coverage to indigenous people and women. They also note that it has addressed with considerable success the fact that Peruvian women’s healthcare costs are much higher than men’s owing to higher rates of illness and reproductive issues. The legislature continues to build upon SIS, {{using it as a}} basis for what many hope will someday be universal healthcare coverage for all Peruvians.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time the {{increasing}} number of internal violent conflicts in Africa, Asia and Europe (Balkans) resulted in concepts of national and international security failing to reflect the challenges of the post Cold War security environment whilst the failure of <b>neoliberal</b> development models to generate growth, particularly in Africa, or to deal with the consequences of complex new threats (such as HIV and climate change) reinforced the sense that international institutions and states were not organised to address such problems in an integrated way.|$|E
25|$|The centre-right National Party, led by {{incumbent}} Prime Minister John Key, {{gained a}} plurality with 47.0% {{of the party}} vote and 60 of the 121 seats. On election night counts, the party appeared to hold the first majority since 1994 with 61 seats, but lost one seat to the Green Party on the official count. National re-entered confidence and supply agreements with the centrist United Future, the <b>neoliberal</b> ACT Party, and the indigenous rights-based Māori Party to form a minority government and give the Fifth National Government a third term.|$|E
