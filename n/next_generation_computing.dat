50|$|Microchannel did {{not gain}} {{widespread}} support, because IBM wanted to exclude clone manufacturers from this <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>computing</b> platform. Anyone developing for MCA {{had to sign}} non-disclosure agreements and pay royalties to IBM for each device sold, putting a price premium on MCA devices. End-users and the clone manufacturers revolted against IBM and developed their own open standards bus, known as EISA. Consequently, MCA receded in use except in IBM's mainframes.|$|E
