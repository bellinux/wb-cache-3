40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} {{was to determine if}} co-activation in enhanced neck muscles increased surface electromyography (sEMG) activity in the masseter while chewing with the 1 st, 2 nd, and 3 rd molars. Sixteen football players from The University of Mississippi volunteered for this study. Football players were examined because they strengthen their neck 4 days a week to help prevent neck injuries and concussions. Participants’ average body fat was 15. 68 % and average body mass was 100. 69 kilograms showing that the participants were larger, muscular individuals compared to non student-athletes and represent a unique, study group. Participants performed maximum weight on a <b>neck</b> weight lifting <b>machine,</b> and then chewed Riesen candy during sEMG recording of the masseter, sternocleidomastoid (SCM), and upper trapezius of the participant’s dominant chew side. During the <b>neck</b> weight lifting <b>machine</b> trials, individuals performed half of the repetitions with their mouth open and relaxed while {{the other half of the}} repetitions were conducted with their mouth closed and clenched. Repetitions with the mouth open generated more force from the SCM by an average of 6 Newtons. Co-activation was documented between the three muscles while performing the <b>neck</b> weight lifting <b>machine</b> and during maximum voluntary chewing on the Reisen candy. The weight of the participant had a significant positive relationship with the body fat (%) (r = 0. 887), neck circumference (r = 0. 604), and max weight (kg) used in the machine (r = 0. 520). More weight on the <b>neck</b> <b>machine</b> and a larger neck circumference had a significant, positive relationship (r = 0. 704). These data indicate a possible association between neck circumference and an increase in muscle mass in the SCM and trapezius. Co-activation through neck exercising encourages an increase in muscle mass in the masseter. The multiple correlations showed a significant, negative relationship between the SCM and masseter for each chew. This shows that the SCM and masseter need to be coordinated and contracted simultaneously to perform the biting task (van der Bilt et al., 2006). Long term dental effects and indirect effects of enhanced neck musculature should be taken into consideration for follow-up study...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the first}} section we provide a short review of the rather young field of Environmental Informatics. We argue that Environmental Informatics methods and tools are {{powerful}} means in environmental information processing for supporting environmental protection and sustainable development. In the second part we introduce an integrated approach for modeling ecoefficient systems such as complex production systems under an economic {{as well as an}} ecological view. This modeling approach allows for the implementation of a combined model representing material and energy flows and bottle <b>necks</b> in <b>machine</b> capacities at the same time (instead of using two different models with different software tools). Finally present a case study from a real waver production site as a proof of concept for this substantial contribution to Environmental Informatics...|$|R
50|$|The term steel guitar {{should not}} be {{confused}} with steel-string guitar, which is a standard acoustic guitar that has steel rather than the nylon, catgut or brass/nickel strings used for classical guitar, and is built with extra bracing, a stronger <b>neck,</b> and higher-geared <b>machine</b> heads to compensate for the much higher tension of steel strings. The steel guitar takes its name from the type of slide used, not from the material of the strings.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Following {{dental implant}} loading, {{marginal}} bone loss {{after one year}} must be evaluated to check correct maintenance of the bone levels. Objectives: To assess implant treatment success and quantify marginal bone loss 6 and 12 months after loading. Material and method: Sixty-one MIS® implants with a 1. 8 mm <b>machined</b> <b>neck</b> were placed in 26 patients. Implant success {{was based on the}} criteria of Buser. Radiological controls were made 6 and 12 months after loading, measuring bone loss mesial and distal. Results: Twenty-two patients with 56 implants were included: 32 in the maxilla and 24 in the mandible. Two implants failed in two patients during the osseointegration phase (both in the maxilla), yielding an implant success rate of 96. 4 %. After 6 months, bone loss was 0. 80 ± 1. 04 mm mesial and 0. 73 ± 1. 08 mm distal, while after 12 months bone loss was 0. 92 ± 1. 02 mesial and 0. 87 ± 1. 01 distal. Conclusions: Bone loss 6 and 12 months after <b>machined</b> <b>neck</b> implant placement was within the normal ranges described in the literature...|$|R
2500|$|Shepherd {{served in}} {{defensive}} sectors {{in the vicinity}} of Verdun. When the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) was committed to combat in the spring of 1918 to halt a German advance towards Paris, he participated in the Aisne-Marne offensive (Château-Thierry) where he was twice wounded in action at Belleau Wood during the fighting there in June 1918. On July 28, 1918, Marine Corps Major General John A. Lejeune (Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, named 1942) assumed command of the 2nd Division. He returned to the front in August, rejoining the 5th Marines, and saw action in the St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne offensives [...] (Champagne) where he was wounded for the third time, shot through the <b>neck</b> by a <b>machine</b> gun.|$|R
5000|$|It has a 1972 Telecaster {{body with}} 2 humbucking pickups, one volume knob, a Fender neckplate, and a Telecaster Deluxe headstock. At first the Telecaster {{had only one}} pickup in the bridge, the Seymour Duncan SH-4 JB Humbucker. This model was first used during the tour for Sum 41's third album [...] "Chuck". A second pickup was later on, the Antiquity JB Model Humbucker but then was {{replaced}} by a Wide Range Humbucker pickup in the neck while leaving the bridge pickup the same. His current model is with Seymour Duncan and Wide Range pickups. The input jack is custom made onto the pickguard rather than a side input jack. The body is featured without the traditional pickup selector switch. The <b>neck's</b> tuning <b>machines</b> are Fender American Standard Series Tuning Machines. The guitar also features red X's that Whibley states [...] "Are there for good luck and design". Whibley uses a Get'm Get'm Sergeant guitar strap with chrome Schaller Strap Locks. There is only one color for the Telecaster Deluxe model (Black body with Black pickguard) but comes either black on black or Olympic White body with Black pickguard for the Squier models.|$|R
50|$|He {{managed to}} silence the left German MP-post {{at the western}} bank of the Caen Canal; he and his platoon then came under attack by machine gun fire from the {{direction}} of the Gondree Cafe on the far side of the canal. Brotheridge was hit in the back of the <b>neck</b> by the <b>machine</b> gun fire and died of wounds without regaining consciousness in the early hours of 6 June, aged 28, in a Casualty Collection Post situated in a trench between the Caen Canal and Orne bridges, where Captain John Vaughan RAMC took care of him. Lt. Herbert Denham Brotheridge is buried in the War Cemetery in Ranville Churchyard, near Caen, in France. Ranville was the first village in France to be liberated.|$|R
5000|$|During this period, Sinch {{became known}} for {{their use of the}} [...] "Ocular Noise Machine" [...] or [...] "Viditar", a guitar-shaped video device made of {{transparent}} lucite (acrylic glass) which is operated by the band's fifth member, Jay Smith. The device, also known as a Viditar, feeds computerized footage on to projector screens, and edits it in real-time during the band's live performances. The footage is edited via buttons on the <b>machine's</b> <b>neck</b> and knobs and sliders on its body. Used in conjunction with a PowerBook, the buttons allow the operator to select video files to display, whilst employing knobs and sliders to manipulate and apply special effects to the images. Fearing the device would be copied by another band or, worse, a corporation, Smith applied to have the device patented. Smith is also the founder of Livid Instruments, where he creates and sells his own line of video instruments.|$|R
5000|$|Mechanical bulls {{have existed}} for {{decades as a}} {{training}} device for rodeo competitors, as they enable a rider of rough stock (bucking horses and bull riding) to enhance rodeo performance and refine skills without the risk and unpredictability of a live animal. Although mechanical bulls are still routinely used for rodeo training, they are also utilized as an amusement ride, both as a mobile rental (i.e., party entertainment) and stationary entertainment found in bars, restaurants, and clubs; these may be surrounded by an blown-air inflated structure similar to a [...] "bounce house" [...] or foam pits for safety. There is a modified, less dangerous style used for children's parties, usually with a one-minute timer. Children remove their shoes to get on.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the survival and success rates of immediately restored implants with sandblasted, large-grit, acid-etched (SLA) surfaces over a period of 5 years. Twenty patients (mean age, 47. 3 years) received a total of 21 SLA wide-neck implants in healed mandibular first molar sites after initial periodontal treatment. To be included in the study, the implants had to demonstrate primary stability with an insertion torque value of 35 Ncm. A provisional restoration was fabricated chairside and placed on the day of surgery. Definitive cemented restorations were inserted 8 weeks after surgery. Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs (CPITN) indices and the radiographic distance between the implant shoulder and the first visible bone-implant contact (DIB) were measured and compared over the study period. The initial mean CPITN was 3. 24, and decreased over the study period to 1. 43. At the postoperative radiographic examination, the mean DIB was 1. 41 mm for the 21 implants, indicating that part of the <b>machined</b> <b>neck</b> of the implants was placed slightly below the osseous crest. The mean DIB value increased to 1. 99 mm at the 5 -year examination. This increase proved to be statistically significant (P <. 0001). Between the baseline and 5 -year examinations, the mean bone crest level loss was 0. 58 mm. Success and survival rates of the 21 implants after 5 years of function were 100 %. This 5 -year study confirms that immediate restoration of mandibular molar wide-neck implants with good primary stability, as noted by insertion torque values of at least 35 Ncm, is a safe and predictable procedure.
