5000|$|Epoxy Phenol <b>Novolac</b> (EPN) and Epoxy Cresol <b>Novolac</b> (ECN) resins made by {{reacting}} epichlorohydrin with multifunctional phenol <b>novolac</b> or cresol <b>novolac</b> resins {{have more}} reactive sites compared to DGEBF epoxy resins and on cure result in higher crosslink density thermosets.

50|$|One {{very common}} {{positive}} photoresist {{used with the}} I, G and H-lines from a mercury-vapor lamp {{is based on a}} mixture of diazonaphthoquinone (DNQ) and <b>novolac</b> resin (a phenol formaldehyde resin). DNQ inhibits the dissolution of the <b>novolac</b> resin, but upon exposure to light, the dissolution rate increases even beyond that of pure <b>novolac.</b> The mechanism by which unexposed DNQ inhibits <b>novolac</b> dissolution is not well understood, but is believed to be related to hydrogen bonding (or more exactly diazocoupling in the unexposed region). DNQ-novolac resists are developed by dissolution in a basic solution (usually 0.26N tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) in water).|$|E
50|$|Reaction of phenols with {{formaldehyde}} {{and subsequent}} glycidylation with epichlorohydrin produces epoxidised <b>novolacs,</b> such as epoxy phenol <b>novolacs</b> (EPN) and epoxy cresol <b>novolacs</b> (ECN). These are highly viscous to solid resins with typical mean epoxide functionality of around 2 to 6. The high epoxide functionality of these resins forms a highly crosslinked polymer network displaying high temperature and chemical resistance, but low flexibility.|$|R
50|$|Polyphenols, such as {{bisphenol}} A or <b>novolacs</b> {{can react}} with epoxy resins at elevated temperatures (130-180 °C), normally {{in the presence}} of a catalyst. The resulting material has ether linkages and displays higher chemical and oxidation resistance than typically obtained by curing with amines or anhydrides.Since many <b>novolacs</b> are solids, this class of hardeners is often employed for powder coatings.|$|R
50|$|<b>Novolacs</b> are phenol-{{formaldehyde}} resins with a formaldehyde to phenol {{molar ratio}} {{of less than}} one. The polymerization is brought to completion using acid-catalysis such as oxalic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulfonate acids. The phenol units are mainly linked by methylene and/or ether groups. <b>Novolacs</b> are commonly used as photoresists. See also photolithography. The molecular weights are in the low thousands, corresponding to about 10-20 phenol units.|$|R

5000|$|There are {{two types}} of {{phenolic}} resins - <b>novolacs</b> and resoles. <b>Novolacs</b> are made with acid catalysts and a molar ratio of formaldehyde to phenol of less than one to give methylene linked phenolic oligomers; resoles are made with alkali catalysts and a molar ratio of formaldehyde to phenol of greater than one to give phenolic oligomers with methylene and benzylic ether-linked phenol units.|$|R
50|$|When the {{molar ratio}} of formaldehyde:phenol reaches one, in theory every phenol is linked {{together}} via methylene bridges, generating one single molecule, {{and the system}} is entirely crosslinked. This is why <b>novolacs</b> (F:P <1) do not harden without {{the addition of a}} crosslinking agent, and why resols with the formula F:P >1 will.|$|R
5000|$|Being thermosets, {{hydroxymethyl}} phenols will crosslink on heating {{to around}} 120 °C to form methylene and methyl ether bridges through {{the elimination of}} water molecules. At this point the resin is a 3-dimensional network, which is typical of polymerised phenolic resins. The high crosslinking gives this type of phenolic resin its hardness, good thermal stability, and chemical imperviousness. Resols {{are referred to as}} [...] "one step" [...] resins as they cure without a cross linker unlike <b>novolacs,</b> a [...] "two step" [...] resin.|$|R

40|$|Specific {{phenolic}} resin samples {{have been developed}} as the carbon precursor for SiC/C composites. Liquid {{phenolic resin}}s suitable for fiber-infiltration in the resin transfer moulding (RTM) process are synthesized by using versatile combination of the aromatic component (phenol, naphthalen- 2 -ol) with various formaldehyde equivalents such as methanal, 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetraazatricyclo[3. 3. 1. 13, 7]decane (urotropine), and 1, 3, 5 -trioxane, under different reaction conditions. Room temperature liquid resoles (RTLR) are obtained by using an excess of the formaldehyde component over phenol (≥ 2) under basic conditions. Upon heating RTLR can form a crosslinked network even without addition of a hardening reagent. In addition, <b>novolacs</b> are synthesized under acidic conditions using a phenol/formaldehyde ratio ≥ 1. Nitrogen-containing resins contain nitrogen due to reaction of phenol with urotropine. <b>Novolacs</b> and nitrogen-containing resins are solids at room temperature and not self-curing. To infiltrate these both resins into SiC fibers in the RTM process, they are dissolved in 2 -furanmethanol (furfuryl alcohol FA) and urotropine which is added as curing-agent. Both, the molecular weight {{and the amount of}} the dissolved phenolic resin have an influence on the viscosity and the carbon yield after pyrolysis which is important for this application. The aim was to create different phenolic resins for the fabrication in the RTM process and to characterize the carbon after pyrolysis with respect to the structure and porosity as these are key parameters to generate a stoichiometric SiC matrix by liquid silicon infiltration (LSI) ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{characteristics}} of the preparation of <b>novolacs</b> for the shell process under microwave irradiation are investigated.

The results show that compared with those under conventional heating, the polymerization and dehydration time under microwave irradiation are shortened by 85. 2 % and 80. 7 % respectively; On the other hand, the polymerization and dehydration under microwave irradiation lead to a remarkable increase in flow distance of the resins. Furthermore, the polymerization under microwave irradiation leads to reduced cure time, while the dehydration under microwave irradiation causes a slight increase in cure time...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} the developmental studes on high Tg bismale-imide resin systems for high temperature applications. Epoxy <b>novolacs</b> (EPN) are a special class of resins {{belonging to the}} epoxy resin family showing medium to high functionality.

40|$|Some new {{examples}} of favorable interactions between additives in flame retardant formulations have been found. These include the following: phosphorus combinations such as triphenyl phosphate with a tetraphenyl phenylene diphosphate, and char-former combinations such as <b>novolacs</b> with polyphenylene oxide in styrenics, melamine with polyphenylene oxide and kaolinite in polyolefin elastomers; and a neopentyl phosphonate ester with a melamine phosphate in ethylene-vinyl acetate. Useful interactions were detected by various tests and data analysis methods including multiple regression, and further elucidated by various analytical methods. Some indications of possible modes {{of action and}} explanations for the interactions are presented. Barrier formation appears {{to play an important}} role in these three cases, although vapor phase action (possibly physical) is also noted. Rate of char formation is suggested as an important variable. The systematic use of combinations of differently functioning flame retardants constitutes the ‘systems approach’ which is advocated for the solution of retardancy problems...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Silica filled {{epoxy resins}} as {{encapsulation}} in chip packages reveal {{a major influence}} on the reliability and functionality of microelectronic devices. In this study, the resulting effects of post-mold curing (PMC) on the thermomechanical and chemical properties of different mold compounds were observed. Polymer systems of the investigated mold compounds were based on two orthocresol <b>novolacs</b> (OCN), one biphenyl and one multifunctional resin (MFR). It could be shown, that longer thermal treatment after curing leads in general to further cross-linking of the polymer chains and increases the glass transition temperature Tg. Therefore, the temperature resistance of the mold for following process steps after package assembling, like soldering, can be improved as well as the reliability during temperature cycle tests. However, PMC treatment also increases the moisture absorption. Here, MFR mold exhibit the highest moisture absorption. Also the high Tg of the MFR mold is not much influenced by PMC. Hence, further thermal treatment after curing of the MFR mold is not necessary. In case of OCN and biphenyl mold types, the advantages of PMC are predominating...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two main}} {{production}} methods. One reacts phenol and formaldehyde directly to produce a thermosetting network polymer, while the other restricts the formaldehyde to produce a prepolymer known as <b>novolac</b> which can be moulded and then cured {{with the addition of}} more formaldehyde and heat. There are many variations in both production and input materials that are used to produce a wide variety of resins for special purposes.|$|E
40|$|Electrochemical double-layer {{capacitors}} have, {{in comparison}} to batteries, a relatively high power density. As electrode materials mostly carbonaceous materials are used. The specific surface area of this materials should {{be as high as}} possible, because the specific capacitance is proportional to it. In this work the preparation and development of carbonaceous materials by pyrolysis of polymers were examined. As starting materials polyacrylonitrile and phenol/formaldehyd-resins (<b>novolacs)</b> were used. The high surface area were achieved by pyrolysis with co-substances (chemical activation) like alkali- and earth-alkaline carbonates and carbon blacks or by activation with reactive gases (physical activation) like water vapor and carbon dioxide. The electrochemical characterization were conducted in 10 molar sulfuric acid. Specific surface areas of up to 2900 m 2 /g and specific capacitances for single electrodes of up to 275 F/g could be obtained. A test cell with a specific capacitance of 68 F/g could be cycled over 2000 cycles, without a decrease in the capacitance.

50|$|The {{reaction}} of bisphenols or multifunctional phenol <b>novolac</b> resins with cyanogen bromide or chloride leads to cyanate functional monomers {{which can be}} converted {{in a controlled manner}} into cyanate ester functional prepolymer resins by chain extension or copolymerization. When postcured, all residual cyanate ester functionality polymerises by cyclotrimerisation leading to tightly crosslinked polycyanurate networks with high thermal stability and glass transition temperatures up to 752 °F (400 °C) and wet heat stability up to around 400 °F (200 °C).|$|E

This leather {{is white}} in color and was invented when vegetable tannins were in short supply during the Second World War. Melamine and other amino-functional resins fall into this category, as well, and they provide the filling that modern leathers often require. Urea-formaldehyde resins were also used in this tanning method before people realized the hazards that formaldehyde presents to tanners and consumers.|$|E
5000|$|Positive {{photoresists}} {{are composed}} of a <b>novolac</b> resin, ethyl lactate solvent, and Diazonaphthaquinone (DQ) as the photoactive compound. [...] Positive photoresist reacts with light to cause the polymer to break down and become soluble in a developer solution. Positive resist has better resistance to etchant than negative photoresist. Positive resists are better for producing small feature size, but does not adhere to silicon wafers as well as negative resist. When making small features {{it is critical to}} have good adhesion.|$|E
50|$|Epoxy/Urethane Systems: Epoxy/urethane {{systems are}} also topical film membranes. They share {{many of the}} same {{characteristics}} as acrylics, but the performance levels and life span are superior and commensurately more costly with more complex installation requirements. <b>Novolac</b> epoxies are particularly noted for chemical resistance and acid resistance. High-end urethanes are known to be extremely abrasion resistant. Epoxy/urethane systems are frequently used in demanding applications such as factory floors, garage floors, and restaurants, and water-based versions are often used to seal concrete countertops. Epoxy/urethane systems are generally applied only to fully cured existing concrete, although certain epoxy products can comply with ASTM C309.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemistry}} of the cure reaction is a trimerization of three CN groups to a triazine ring. When the monomer contains two cyanate groups the resulting structure is a 3D polymer network. Thermoset polymer matrix properties can be fine tuned by {{the choice of}} substituents in the bisphenolic compound. Bisphenol A and <b>novolac</b> based cyanate esters are the major products; bisphenol F and bisphenol E are also used. The aromatic ring of the bisphenol can be substituted with an allylic group for improved toughness of the material. Cyanate esters can also be mixed with bismaleimides to form BT-resins or with epoxy resins to optimize the end use properties.|$|E
50|$|Diazonaphthoquinone {{sulfonic}} acid esters {{are commonly used}} as components of photoresist materials for semiconductor manufacturing. In this application DNQs are mixed with <b>Novolac</b> resin, a type of phenolic polymer. The DNQ functions as a dissolution inhibitor. During the masking/patterning process, portions of the photoresist film are exposed to light while others remain unexposed. In the unexposed regions of the resist film, the DNQ acts as a dissolution inhibitor and the resist remains insoluble in the aqueous base developer. In the exposed regions, the DNQ forms a ketene, which, in turn, reacts with ambient water to form a base soluble indene carboxylic acid. The exposed regions of the photoresist film become soluble in aqueous base; thus allowing {{the formation of a}} relief image during development.|$|E
50|$|Big molecules, {{also called}} high {{molecular}} weight, HMW molecules, are mostly oligomers or polymers of small molecules or chains of amino acids. Thus, within pharma sciences, peptides, proteins and oligonucleotides constitute the major categories.Peptides and proteins are oligomers or polycondensates of amino acids linked {{together by a}} carboxamide group. The threshold {{between the two is}} as at about 50 amino acids. Because of their unique biological functions, a significant and growing part of new drug discovery and development is focused on this class of biomolecules. Their biological functions are determined by the exact arrangement or sequence of different amino acids in their makeup. For the synthesis of peptides, four categories of fine chemicals, commonly referred to as peptide building blocks (PBBs), are key, namely amino acids (=starting materials), protected amino acids, peptide fragments and peptides themselves. Along the way, the molecular weights increase from about 102 up to 104 and the unit prices from about $100 up to $105 per kilogram. However, {{only a small part of}} the total amino acid production is used for peptide synthesis. In fact, L-glutamic acid, D, L-methionine, L-aspartic acid and L-phenylalanine are used in large quantities as food and feed additives. About 50 peptide drugs are commercialized. The number of amino acids that make up a specific peptide varies widely. At the low end are the dipeptides. The most important drugs with a dipeptide (L-alanyl-L-proline) moiety are the “-pril” cardiovascular drugs, such as Alapril (lisinopril), Captoril (captopril), <b>Novolac</b> (imidapril) and Renitec (enalapril). Also the artificial sweetener Aspartame (N-L-α-Aspartyl-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester) is a dipeptide. At the high end there is the anticoagulant hirudin, MW ≈ 7000, which is composed of 65 amino acids.|$|E
