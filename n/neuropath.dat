Tyramine infusion produced {{a statistically significant}} increase in systolic blood pressure (BP) in the autonomic <b>neuropaths</b> only (p less than 0. 001). No change occurred in diastolic BP. Noradrenaline infusion produced a statistically significant increase in systolic BP in the normal subjects (p less than 0. 01) and in the autonomic <b>neuropaths</b> (p less than 0. 001). The increase in systolic BP in the <b>neuropaths</b> was significantly greater (p less than 0. 001) than in normal subjects.

50|$|In 2008, Bakker {{published}} <b>Neuropath,</b> a {{near future}} SF psychothriller which thematically continued Bakker's elucidation of human cognitive biases and their implications regarding human meaning, purpose, and morality, whatever form they may take. While the narrative {{events of the}} book make for a compelling thought experiment, Bakker included as an Author Afterward a short essay regarding the blending of factual and fictive premises therein and the eventual advent of the narrative's villain in our own world. The essay marks Bakker first formal mention of his Blind Brain Hypothesis, beyond its use in the narrative proper.|$|E
5000|$|As Bakker {{continues}} he expands on Informatic Asymmetry and the Asymptotic Limits {{of different}} Recursive Systems writing of information horizons, [...] "the boundaries that delimit the recursive neural access that underwrites consciousness." [...] Describing consciousness as encapsulated {{by the global}} limit of information horizons, Bakker highlights consciousness inability to perceive any absence of information, that is processing outside of the RS-closed, as in some anosognosias. The information provided to consciousness is perceived as sufficient because the RS-closed is unable to track the discrepancy of the information processed by the whole brain. Bakker returns to the Coin Trick analogy from <b>Neuropaths</b> Author Afterword, using the magician as an extended explanatory metaphor to further elucidate Asymptotic Limits of specific Recursive Systems and the Asymptotic Complex of encapsulation regarding the experience of persistent global sufficiency, from where the paper almost certainly gets the former part of its title.|$|R
5000|$|Building on his elucidations from <b>Neuropaths</b> Author Afterword, Bakker {{presents}} {{the metaphor of}} the Blind Brain Hypothesis as a magicians coin trick. By Bakkers argument the brain has evolved to process a prodigious amount of perceptual information regarding its local environment tracking natural objects with causal histories. Coin tricks through sleight of hand or misdirection exploit the brains need for that causal history, confounding the brains ability to process the coins causal history. Given the central assumption of Blind Brain Hypothesis, that [...] "information that finds its way to consciousness represents {{only a small fraction of}} the brainâ€™s overall information load," [...] humans are likely likewise unable to account for the causal history of thoughts and behaviours. It supposes that our conscious awareness of information processed by the brain is preceded by what Bakker calls here information horizons. Again Bakker draws upon the analogy of the eyes perceptual thresholds, this time highlighting that half of all the retinal nerves process information exclusively from the receptor rich fovea, and also extends that metaphor to speculate about the information horizons of our temporal field and the experience of the [...] "Now." ...|$|R
40|$|Thresholds for {{cutaneous}} {{warming and}} cooling stimuli were measured in 20 diabetics with neuropathic foot ulcers. All patients {{had a profound}} disturbance of sensory perception in the ulcerated foot with complete loss of perception of warming; thresholds for vibration and cooling were highly abnormal in all but two patients. Measurements of thermal threshold were made on both feet in 10 patients: warming was lost bilaterally in all, and cooling was bilaterally absent in six. There was no clear pattern of sensory loss in those diabetics with unilateral foot ulceration to suggest that sensory impairment was the determining factor {{for the development of}} a plantar ulcer. Measurements of thermal thresholds were made at additional sites in 13 patients and although the most marked abnormalities of sensation were always found in the feet, in some severe <b>neuropaths,</b> abnormal thresholds on the hand and even the face were demonstrated. Thresholds for warming were invariably more abnormal than thresholds for cooling. The diabetics with neuropathic ulceration in this study all had severe generalised peripheral nerve disease involving large myelinated as well as both small myelinated and unmyelinated sensory fibres. The quantitative evidence on the distribution of sensory loss for thermal sensations supports the hypothesis that the neuropathic process affecting the small myelinated and unmyelinated fibres is length dependent...|$|R
5000|$|Nearing {{the close}} of The Last Magic Show, Bakker delves into the highly {{speculative}} implications of Blind Brain Theorys argument for the appearance of consciousness regarding the use and reference of Intentionality in academic philosophy, as well as, the very underpinnings of humanitys scientific and philosophic endeavours, logic and math, the latter of which might reference an earlier essayistic work posted to Three Pound Brain. He also writes of the [...] "First-person Perspective Show," [...] which almost definitely precedes his draft paper, The Introspective Peep Show.

5000|$|Narrative aside, in the Author Afterword Bakker sources two {{real world}} {{examples}} concerning illusory consciousness, the inner human experience of temporality and the imperceptible limits of field of vision. In the essay, {{as in the}} book via the character Thomas, Bakker argues that the human sense of the [...] "Now," [...] this very moment, might be symptomatic of perceptual thresholds akin to the human inability to perceive beyond the field of vision, certain colours outside within that field, or the perceptual blind spot caused {{by the lack of}} receptors in a portion {{of the back of the}} eye. Bakker cites the inability of consciousness to experience and perceive but a sliver of all the brain's processing as indicative of consciousness experience being totally illusory, rather than only sometimes in some contexts. As per the world of <b>Neuropath's</b> narrative, Bakker also argues that in time non-invasive brain scanning, via something like the narrative conceit of [...] "low-field fMRI," [...] may result in an entirely new scale of institutional manipulation, moving beyond efforts of associative conditioning given the wealth of data prevalent real-time brain imaging could provide. Finally, central to the essay is Bakker's assertion that the scientific method and its progress would eventually yield unfathomable insights into human behavior and cognition such that the existence of the narrative's villain and his futuristic brain-computer interface are inevitable in real life as well.|$|R
40|$|An in-shoe laser Doppler sensor for {{assessing}} plantar blood {{flow in the}} diabetic foot. Jonathan Edwin Cobb Plantar ulceration is a complication of the diabetic foot prevalent in adults with type 11 diabetes mellitus. Although neuropathy, microvascular disease and biornechanical factors are all implicated, the mechanism by which the tissue becomes pre-disposed to damage remains unclear. Recent theories suggest that the nutritional supply to the tissue is compromised, either by increased flow through the arteriovenous anastomoses ('capillary steal' theory) or through changes in the micro vascu I ature (haemodynamic hypothesis). Clinical data to support these ideas has been limited to assessment of the unclad foot under rest conditions. A limitation of previous studies has been the exclusion of static and dynamic tissue loading, despite extensive evidence that these biornechanical factors are essential {{in the development of}} plantar ulceration. The present study has overcome these problems by allowing assessment of plantar blood flow, in-shoe, during standing and walking. The system comprises a laser Doppler blood flux sensor operating at 780 nm, load sensor, measurement shoe, instrumentation, and analysis software. In-vitro calibration was performed using standard techniques. An in-vivo study {{of a small group of}} diabetic subjects indicated differences in the blood flux response between diabetic <b>neuropaths,</b> diabetics with vascular complications and a control group.

40|$|Antimuscarinic {{drugs are}} {{generally}} thought to exert their therapeutic action on detrusor overactivity {{by reducing the}} ability of the detrusor muscle to contract. We review currently available published data to establish whether there is any evidence to support this contention. Using a PubMed data search, only 14 original articles (including two abstracts) were found that contained cystometric data for both filling and voiding phases and where the actions of antimuscarinic drugs have been reported in detail. These articles were separated into three groups dealing with neuropathic patients (three papers), patients with idiopathic overactive bladder (four papers) and a group whose aetiology was unclear (seven papers). Variables relating to bladder function during the filling phase (time of first desire to void, time to first unstable contraction, and bladder capacity) were identified. Similarly, variables relating to voiding were identified and compared (e. g. maximum detrusor pressure and detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate). The antimuscarinic drugs have a clearly significant effect on sensations of urge, time to first sensation to void, maximum bladder capacity, decrease in voiding frequency and reduction in incontinence episodes. However, only one article (studying <b>neuropaths)</b> reported a significant reduction of the variables associated with detrusor contraction. The remaining four studies (idiopaths/not stated), reported no change in bladder contractility with antimuscarinic drugs. Thus the available data do not support the conclusion that antimuscarinic drugs at doses used in current clinical practice exert their therapeutic action by inhibiting detrusor contractility, but they suggest effects on variables associated with sensation...|$|R

40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{evidence to suggest}} that genetic factors are involved in the pathogenesis of microvascular complications in diabetes mellitus. Recent studies have suggested that genetic variations in the aldose reductase (ALR 2) gene may contribute to the genetic susceptibility to microvascular complications. Aldose reductase is the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the polyol pathway and is implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic microvascular disease (nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy). It has recently been shown that the three polymorphisms of the ALR 2 gene are associated with susceptibility to microvascular complications in both TIDM and T 2 DM. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the CA dinucleotide repeat polymorphism (5 'ALR 2) that is located - 2100 bp and the C- 106 T substitution in the promoter region of the ALR 2 gene, and also the A+ 11842 C within intron 8 of the ALR 2 gene itself. DNA from 285 Caucasoid patients with TIDM and well-defined microvascular disease and 120 normal healthy controls, as well as 60 Southern Indian patients with T 2 DM and 43 non diabetic controls were typed. The 5 'ALR 2 Z- 2 /X genotype was significantly increased in patients with nephropathy (n= 92), retinopathy (n= 160) and neuropathy (n= 104) compared to those with no microvascular disease after 19 years duration of diabetes (uncomplicated, n= 66) (46 %, 41 %, 42 % vs. 24 %, respectively). In contrast, the frequency of the Z+ 2 /Y genotype (where Y is not Z- 2) was significantly reduced in the patients with nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy compared to the uncomplicated (17 %, 23 %, 23 % vs. 52 %, respectively). Similar observations were made in the Southern Indian T 2 DM patients, however no significant differences were found. In the patients with TIDM the C- 106 allele was associated with the Z- 2 5 'ALR 2 allele. The C/Z- 2 haplotype was present in 32 % of the nephropaths, 32 % of the retinopaths and 35 % of the <b>neuropaths</b> compared to 11. 5 % of the uncomplicated. The A+ 11842 allele was also associated with the C- 1 06 allele in TIDM patients with microvascular disease. The reported mitochondrial polymorphism (mt 5178 A/C) was not found in this. TIDM population, possibly due to differences in the background frequencies between ethnic groups. Family studies investigating the transmission of the 5 'ALR 2 and C- 106 T alleles from parents to offspring with diabetic nephropathy found preferential transmission of the Z- 2 allele although this was not statistically significant. Functional studies of the activity of the ORE in TIDM patients with and without microvascular disease showed differences in the mean OREBP binding activity. OREB and OREC were found to have increased activity in response to hyperglycaemia in the complicated patients compared to the uncomplicated and normal controls. In conclusion, these results confirm the role of the aldose reductase gene in the genetic susceptibility to diabetic microvascular complications, and a possible role of the DI 7 S 934 polymorphism in T 2 DM. These results also provide a novel insight into the role of the ORE of the ALR 2 gene in the pathogenesis of diabetic microvascular complications. Further studies are now required to determine the molecular basis of these observations. Hopefully, in the future it will be possible to offer 'high risk' patients therapeutic intervention that will prevent the ravages of the long term complications of diabetes mellitus...|$|R
