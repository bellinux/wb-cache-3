25|$|In April 1862, Thomson left Edinburgh for Singapore, {{beginning}} a ten-year period spent travelling around the Far East. Initially, {{he established a}} joint business with William to manufacture marine chronometers and optical and <b>nautical</b> <b>instruments.</b> He also established a photographic studio in Singapore, taking portraits of European merchants, and he developed an interest in local peoples and places. He travelled extensively throughout the mainland territories of Malaya and the island of Sumatra, exploring the villages and photographing the native peoples and their activities.|$|E

50|$|During the 1930s {{many of the}} London <b>nautical</b> <b>instrument</b> makers were in difficulties, {{including}} John Lilley and Son Limited and Reynolds and Son, Dobbie and Clyde Limited, and Mr. J.W.

50|$|Mr John Wilson Gillie {{was born}} on the 31st of March 1864. On the 31st of July 1880 he was apprenticed for four years to J.J. Wilson and Sons, <b>Nautical</b> <b>Instrument</b> Makers of Sunderland. Following the {{apprenticeship}} he spent {{six months to a}} year as an ‘improver’ in Glasgow, and then started a new company ‘Wilson and Gillie’ in North Shields.|$|R
6000|$|... 'In a {{postscript}} {{is mentioned}} {{the arrival of}} some exquisite altar plate for the College chapel, which had been offered by a lady, who had also bountifully supplied with chronometers and <b>nautical</b> <b>instruments</b> the 'Southern Cross,' which was fast being built at Southampton.|$|E
60|$|My first {{work was}} to pull open the drawer {{of the cabin}} table. I found it full of charts and <b>nautical</b> <b>instruments,</b> {{accompanied}} by the log-book. There was also, stuffed in one corner, the ship's articles, and opening it, I discovered my name at the very end, written in a rough hand, entirely different from my own.|$|E
60|$|As for {{intervening}} shoals or reefs, if any there were, they intimidated us not. In a {{boat that}} drew but {{a few inches of}} water, but an indifferent look-out would preclude all danger on that score. At all events, the thing seemed feasible enough, notwithstanding old Jarl's superstitious reverence for <b>nautical</b> <b>instruments,</b> and the philosophical objections which might have been urged by a pedantic disciple of Mercator.|$|E
5000|$|Following Ritchie’s {{death in}} 1895, his sons {{transferred}} the scientific instruments to the L. E. Knott Apparatus Co., while retaining the <b>nautical</b> <b>instrument</b> line, which was renamed E.S. Ritchie & Sons. The firm was incorporated as E.S. Ritchie & Sons, Inc. in 1939, and continues operations {{to the present}} day. [...] It is now located in Pembroke, Massachusetts, and known as Ritchie Navigation.|$|R
50|$|In March 1856 Burt sent {{a sample}} {{of one of his}} Equatorial Sextants to the Navy Department. He sent another sample to the U.S. Coast Guard. They both agreed that Burt's Equatorial Sextant met the purpose of its design. His {{precision}} instrument was then finalized and approved on a patent November 15, 1856. Burt envisioned a greater worldwide potential for his <b>nautical</b> <b>instrument</b> than for that of his surveying instrument of the Solar Compass.|$|R
50|$|A marine sandglass is a {{timepiece}} {{of simple}} design {{that is a}} relative of the common hourglass, a marine (<b>nautical)</b> <b>instrument</b> known since the 14th century (although reasonably presumed to be of very ancient use and origin). They were employed to measure the time at sea or on a given navigational course, in repeated measures of small time increments (e.g., 30 minutes). Used together with the chip log, smaller marine sandglasses were also {{used to measure the}} boat speed through the water in knots.|$|R
60|$|Rankine {{took them}} into a small, teak-paneled room with a brass stove in a corner. It was remarkably neat, though a {{cushioned}} locker, a small table, and two camp-chairs comprised the furniture. <b>Nautical</b> <b>instruments</b> occupied a rack, and a large chart of the Irish Sea was spread upon the table. Rankine put {{a bottle of wine}} and some cigarettes on the chart, and then hung up his wet oilskins.|$|E
60|$|The sailor was at {{all times}} delighted to {{instruct}} {{the boys in the}} art of seamanship, and under his tutelage they learned rapidly, so that any of them could go aloft and make or take in sail whenever required. He also taught them how to make knots of various kinds, and many other things useful on board a ship. In the meantime Captain Marshall allowed them to read his works on navigation, and gave them a few lessons in steering, and {{in the use of the}} compass, sextant, and other <b>nautical</b> <b>instruments.</b>|$|E

"It appeared--and I cannot {{tell you}} how shocked I was when I {{discovered}} the truth--that the box which I had carried away did not contain <b>nautical</b> <b>instruments,</b> but was filled with valuable plate and jewels. My unfortunate father heard {{from a man who}} had been discharged from the service of the family whose house he had visited--whose name, by the way, was not Green--where the box containing the valuables mentioned was always placed at night, and he had also received accurate information in regard to the situation of the rooms and the best method of gaining access to them.|$|E

2500|$|The 19th-century {{seafaring}} village contains {{nearly all}} the types of general and specialized trades associated with building and operating a sailing fleet. They include a chandlery, sail loft, ropewalk, cooperage, shipping agent's office, printing office, bank, and others. [...] Also included is The Spouter Tavern, open seasonally and serving [...] "travelers' fare". [...] Each building is used both to show the original activity and to display multiple examples of objects sold or constructed; for instance, the <b>nautical</b> <b>instrument</b> shop displays sextants, nautical timepieces, and the like. [...] Demonstrations at the cooperage show how casks are assembled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] {{continued}} the burglar, [...] "we {{pulled up to}} a stone wall which {{was at the bottom}} of Green's place and made fast, and father he got out and went up to the house. After a good while he came back and said that he was pretty sure Williamson Green had gone to bed, and as it wouldn't do to waken people up from their sleep to ask them for <b>nautical</b> <b>instruments</b> they had borrowed, he sat down for a minute {{on the top of the}} wall, and then he slapped his knee, not making much noise, though.|$|E
60|$|Dr. Wilmot {{rose with}} quiet alacrity. Wolfenden {{led the way}} down the long passage which led to the study. He himself was {{scarcely}} prepared for such signs of unusual labours as confronted them both when they opened the door. The round table in the centre of the room was piled with books and a loose heap of papers. A special rack was hung with a collection of maps and charts. There were <b>nautical</b> <b>instruments</b> upon the table, and compasses, as well as writing materials, and a number of small models of men-of-war. Mr. Blatherwick, who was sitting at {{the other side of the}} room busy with some copying, looked up in amazement at the entrance of Wolfenden and a stranger upon what was always considered forbidden ground.|$|E
60|$|Upon this, vague {{though they}} were, my suspicions returned; and I closely {{questioned}} the Islander concerning {{the disappearance of}} these important articles. In reply, he gave me to understand, that the <b>nautical</b> <b>instruments</b> had been clandestinely carried down into the forecastle by Annatoo; and by that indefatigable and inquisitive dame they had been summarily taken apart for scientific inspection. It was impossible to restore them; {{for many of the}} fixtures were lost, including the colored glasses, sights, and little mirrors; and many parts still recoverable, were so battered and broken as to be entirely useless. For several days afterward, we now and then came across bits of the quadrant or sextant; but it was only to mourn over their fate.|$|E
50|$|In 1887, Weilbach’s {{business}} was split between two brothers, Iver Christian Weilbach and Johannes Sophus Vilhelm Weilbach. The former {{took over the}} compass and <b>nautical</b> <b>instrument</b> business, and the latter got the flag and sail business. J.S.V. Weilbach’s flag and sail making activities continued into the twentieth century, but {{the decline of the}} sailing fleet after 1900 caused the business to contract. J.S.V. Weilbach responded to the technological changes in shipping by shifting business focus from production of marine sails to tarpaulin and tents, thus diversifying the product range by using existing know how in new ways.|$|R
50|$|An {{azimuth compass}} (or {{azimuthal}} compass) is a <b>nautical</b> <b>instrument</b> {{used to measure}} the magnetic azimuth, the angle of the arc on the horizon between the direction of the sun or some other celestial object and the magnetic north. This can be compared to the true azimuth obtained by astronomical observation to determine the magnetic declination, the amount by which the reading of a ship's compass must be adjusted to obtain an accurate reading. Azimuth compasses were important in the period before development of the reliable chronometers needed to determine a vessel's exact position from astronomical observations.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{results were}} obtained as {{the consequence of}} observation done under teh influence of the annular eclipse. (1) About 1 ° of error was observed in case of the Magnetic compass. (2) No variation of the Loran was perceived; while an emergence of fading was recognized the cause of which being left unaccountable. (3) Nothing unusual on the variation of the Radar. In a nutshell, {{the influence of the}} annular eclipse upon the <b>nautical</b> <b>instrument</b> was ascertained to be too small to cause a considerable error; so it may safely be said that it has almost no disturbing influence on the ship's voyage...|$|R
6000|$|His way now led {{towards the}} river-side regions, and a {{cleansing}} whiff of tar {{was to be}} detected in the stagnant autumn air. Men with the blue jersey and peaked cap of the boatman, or the white ducks of the dockers, began to replace the corduroys and fustian of the laborers. Shops with <b>nautical</b> <b>instruments</b> in the windows, rope and paint sellers, and slop shops with long rows of oilskins dangling from hooks, all proclaimed the neighborhood of the docks. The Admiral quickened his pace and straightened his figure as his surroundings became more nautical, until at last, peeping between two high, dingy wharfs, he {{caught a glimpse of}} the mud-colored waters of the Thames, and of the bristle of masts and funnels which rose from its broad bosom. To the right lay a quiet street, with many brass plates upon either side, and wire blinds in all of the windows. The Admiral walked slowly down it until [...] "The Saint Lawrence Shipping Company" [...] caught his eye. He crossed the road, pushed open the door, and found himself in a low-ceilinged office, with a long counter at one end and a great number of wooden sections of ships stuck upon boards and plastered all over the walls.|$|E
6000|$|I went {{a little}} way into St. Katharine's Dock, and found it crowded with great ships; then, returning, I strolled along the range of shops that front towards {{this side of the}} Tower. They have all {{something}} to do with ships, sailors, and commerce; being for the sale of ships' stores, <b>nautical</b> <b>instruments,</b> arms, clothing, together with a tavern and grog-shop at every other door; bookstalls, too, covered with cheap novels and song-books; cigar-shops in great numbers; and everywhere were sailors, and here and there a soldier, and children at the doorsteps, and women showing themselves at the doors or windows of their domiciles. These latter figures, however, pertain rather to the street up which I walked, penetrating into the interior of this region, which, I think, is Blackwall--no, I forget what its name is. At all events, it has an ancient and most grimy and rough look, with its old gabled houses, each of them the seat of some petty trade and business in its basement story. Among these I saw one house with three or four peaks along its front,--a second story projecting over the basement, and the whole clapboarded over. [...] . There was a butcher's stall in the lower story, with a front open to the street, in the ancient fashion, which seems to be retained only by butchers' shops. This part of London having escaped the Great Fire, I suppose there may be many relics of architectural antiquity hereabouts.|$|E
60|$|With a shyness {{that was}} almost awe, Nares and I descended the companion. The stair turned upon itself and landed us just forward of a thwart-ship {{bulkhead}} that cut the poop in two. The fore part formed a kind of miscellaneous store-room, with a double-bunked division for the cook (as Nares supposed) and second mate. The after part contained, in the midst, the main cabin, running {{in a kind of}} bow into the curvature of the stern; on the port side, a pantry opening forward and a stateroom for the mate; and on the starboard, the captain's berth and water-closet. Into these we did but glance, the main cabin holding us. It was dark, for the sea-birds had obscured the skylight with their droppings; it smelt rank and fusty: and it was beset with a loud swarm of flies that beat continually in our faces. Supposing them close attendants upon man and his broken meat, I marvelled how they had found their way to Midway Reef; it was sure at least some vessel must have brought them, and that long ago, for they had multiplied exceedingly. Part of the floor was strewn with a confusion of clothes, books, <b>nautical</b> <b>instruments,</b> odds and ends of finery, and such trash as might be expected from the turning out of several seamen's chests, upon a sudden emergency and after a long cruise. It was strange in that dim cabin, quivering with the near thunder of the breakers and pierced with the screaming of the fowls, to turn over so many things that other men had coveted, and prized, and worn on their warm bodies--frayed old underclothing, pyjamas of strange design, duck suits in every stage of rustiness, oil-skins, pilot coats, embroidered shirts, jackets of Ponjee silk--clothes for the night watch at sea or the day ashore in the hotel verandah: and mingled among these, books, cigars, bottles of scent, fancy pipes, quantities of tobacco, many keys, a rusty pistol, and a sprinkling of cheap curiosities--Benares brass, Chinese jars and pictures, and bottles of odd shells in cotton, each designed, no doubt, for somebody at home--perhaps in Hull, of which Trent had been a native and his ship a citizen.|$|E
5000|$|An archaeological {{expedition}} to the Juan Fernández Islands in February 2005 found part of a <b>nautical</b> <b>instrument</b> that could have belonged to Selkirk. It was [...] "a fragment of copper alloy identified as being {{from a pair of}} navigational dividers" [...] dating from the early 18th (or late 17th) century. Selkirk is the only person known to have been on the island at that time who is likely to have had dividers, and was even said by Rogers to have had such instruments in his possession. The artefact was discovered while excavating a site not far from Selkirk's Lookout where the famous castaway is believed to have lived.|$|R
6000|$|Easterns do not [...] "box the compass" [...] {{after our}} fashion: with them each point {{has its own}} name, {{generally}} derived from some prominent star on the horizon. Of these I subjoin a list as in use amongst the Somal, hoping {{that it may be}} useful to Oriental students. The names in hyphens are those given in a paper on the <b>nautical</b> <b>instrument</b> of the Arabs by Jas. Prinseps (Journal of the As. Soc., December 1836). The learned secretary appears not to have heard the legend of Shaykh Majid, for he alludes to the [...] "Majidi Kitab" [...] or Oriental Ephemeris, without any explanation.|$|R
50|$|At {{this time}} sail had just {{given way to}} steam and wooden ships to steel, and the {{railways}} were competing with colliers for the carrying of coal from the North East of England to London and the South. In 1858 only seven out of 44 shipyards on the Tyne were using iron, but by 1862 there were ten, employing around 4,000 men. These changes {{had a significant effect}} on <b>nautical</b> <b>instrument</b> manufacturers, as the magnetic compass for a wooden sailing vessel was very simple and required {{little in the way of}} compensation. For steel vessels much more was required and this was a period of great development, both in the compass bowl and the binnacle in which it was housed.|$|R
60|$|Down by the Docks, {{they eat}} the largest oysters and scatter the roughest oyster-shells, {{known to the}} {{descendants}} of Saint George and the Dragon. Down by the Docks, they consume the slimiest of shell-fish, which {{seem to have been}} scraped off the copper bottoms of ships. Down by the Docks, the vegetables at green-grocers' doors acquire a saline and a scaly look, {{as if they had been}} crossed with fish and seaweed. Down by the Docks, they 'board seamen' at the eating-houses, the public-houses, the slop-shops, the coffee-shops, the tally-shops, all kinds of shops mentionable and unmentionable--board them, as it were, in the piratical sense, making them bleed terribly, and giving no quarter. Down by the Docks, the seamen roam in mid-street and mid-day, their pockets inside out, and their heads no better. Down by the Docks, the daughters of wave-ruling Britannia also rove, clad in silken attire, with uncovered tresses streaming in the breeze, bandanna kerchiefs floating from their shoulders, and crinoline not wanting. Down by the Docks, you may hear the Incomparable Joe Jackson sing the Standard of England, with a hornpipe, any night; or any day may see at the waxwork, for a penny and no waiting, him as killed the policeman at Acton and suffered for it. Down by the Docks, you may buy polonies, saveloys, and sausage preparations various, if you are not particular what they are made of besides seasoning. Down by the Docks, the children of Israel creep into any gloomy cribs and entries they can hire, and hang slops there--pewter watches, sou'-wester hats, waterproof overalls--'firtht rate articleth, Thjack.' Down by the Docks, such dealers exhibiting on a frame a complete nautical suit without the refinement of a waxen visage in the hat, present the imaginary wearer as drooping at the yard-arm, with his seafaring and earthfaring troubles over. Down by the Docks, the placards in the shops apostrophise the customer, knowing him familiarly beforehand, as, 'Look here, Jack!' 'Here's your sort, my lad!' 'Try our sea-going mixed, at two and nine!' 'The right kit for the British tar!' 'Ship ahoy!' 'Splice the main- brace, brother!' 'Come, cheer up, my lads. We've the best liquors here, And you'll find something new In our wonderful Beer!' Down by the Docks, the pawnbroker lends money on Union-Jack pocket- handkerchiefs, on watches with little ships pitching fore and aft on the dial, on telescopes, <b>nautical</b> <b>instruments</b> in cases, and such-like. Down by the Docks, the apothecary sets up in business on the wretchedest scale--chiefly on lint and plaster for the strapping of wounds--and with no bright bottles, and with no little drawers. Down by the Docks, the shabby undertaker's shop will bury you for next to nothing, after the Malay or Chinaman has stabbed you for nothing at all: so you can hardly hope to make a cheaper end. Down by the Docks, anybody drunk will quarrel with anybody drunk or sober, and everybody else will have a hand in it, and on the shortest notice you may revolve in a whirlpool of red shirts, shaggy beards, wild heads of hair, bare tattooed arms, Britannia's daughters, malice, mud, maundering, and madness. Down by the Docks, scraping fiddles go in the public-houses all day long, and, shrill above their din and all the din, rises the screeching of innumerable parrots brought from foreign parts, who appear to be very much astonished by what they find on these native shores of ours. Possibly the parrots don't know, possibly they do, that Down by the Docks is the road to the Pacific Ocean, with its lovely islands, where the savage girls plait flowers, and the savage boys carve cocoa-nut shells, and the grim blind idols muse in their shady groves to exactly the same purpose as the priests and chiefs. And possibly the parrots don't know, possibly they do, that the noble savage is a wearisome impostor wherever he is, and has five hundred thousand volumes of indifferent rhyme, and no reason, to answer for.|$|E

60|$|The captain, who, {{with his}} passengers, {{was in the}} larger boat, was {{aware that he was}} off the coast of Peru, but that was all he {{certainly}} knew of his position. The storm had struck the ship in the morning, before he had taken his daily observation, and his room, which was on deck, had been carried away, as well as every <b>nautical</b> <b>instrument</b> on board. He did not believe that the storm had taken him far out of his course, but of this he could not be sure.

5000|$|Born in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, [...] Appleyard became apprenticed to a <b>nautical</b> <b>instrument</b> maker {{after being}} forced to leave school owing to {{economic}} reasons related to the Second World War. At that time {{the popularity of the}} American Big Bands was growing in England, particularly through a major influx in big band recordings from America by jazz musicians like Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, and Count Basie. These recordings had a strong influence on Appleyard and he decided to pursue a career as a jazz musician. He began his career in the early 1940s playing in the Boys Brigade, a youth organization. He performed as a drummer in several other British dance bands during the 1940s and, while a member of the Royal Air Force during in the mid-1940s, played in RAF bands.|$|R
50|$|When Burt {{was about}} {{fourteen}} his father {{sent him to}} the district school for a total of three weeks and began arithmetic studies. He did well at that and at any leisure moments he pursued the studies on his own. About this time his father gave him a book on navigation that was published in 1779. Burt showed much interest in this and was inspired to someday become a master of a boat. He motivated himself to learn the traverse table and the method of determining latitude. He developed mechanical skills which enabled him to construct a quadrant instrument. With this he determined the latitude of his father's house with a pretty good degree of accuracy, even though he had never seen a <b>nautical</b> <b>instrument</b> before. He was also interested in astronomy and studied almanacs and navigation.|$|R
