5|$|On 1 January 1949, King married divorceé Anita Leslie (Anita Theodosia Moira Rodzianko King 1914–1984). She was {{the eldest}} child of Sir John Randolph Shane Leslie, 3rd Baronet {{and his wife}} Marjorie Ide, the Vermont-born {{daughter}} of the US ambassador to Spain. Bill and Anita probably met in Lebanon in 1943, where King served for 5 months as {{executive officer of the}} submarine base at Beirut. She was on a skiing trip after doing duty in Africa in the Motor Transport Corps in 1940–42, although a letter mentions her being in Beirut in 1941–42. Leslie-King then became an ambulance driver in the French Army from 1944 to 1945. For the latter, she was awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1945 by General Charles de Gaulle. As Anita Leslie, she wrote over a dozen books, including Love in a <b>Nutshell</b> (1952), The Remarkable Mr. Jerome: The Life and Times of Leonard Jerome, Sir Winston Churchill's American Grandfather (1954). In 1974 she wrote the biography of Francis Chichester, the first person to sail around the world single-handedly with only one stop. The Kings had two children, Richard Tarka Bourke King (b. 1949), and Leonie Rose King (b. 1951).|$|E

3000|$|Macadamia <b>nutshells</b> were washed {{thoroughly}} with {{deionized water}} {{to remove the}} dirt and then dried in the vacuum oven at 105  °C overnight. The shells were crushed and ground to a fine powder and then sieved through a pore size of between 90 and 150  µm. This sample was labeled as the raw Macadamia <b>nutshells</b> (RMN). Part of RMN sample was divided into two parts: One part was treated with 0.1  M HCl (stirred for 3  h) to remove all the nutrients from the shells and labeled acid-treated Macadamia <b>nutshells</b> (ATMN). The other part was treated with 0.1  M NaOH (stirred for 3  h) and was labeled base-treated Macadamia <b>nutshells</b> (BTMN). ATMN and BTMN were washed with deionized water through a funnel until the water coming out of funnel was neutral. The samples were then dried in a vacuum oven at 105  °C overnight.|$|R

25|$|Although {{this tool}} for {{evaluating}} models against {{systems that are}} accessible experimentally may be applied in any field, its application to selecting a statistical model via Akaike information criterion are particularly well described in papers and a book by Burnham and Anderson. In a <b>nutshell</b> the Kullback–Leibler divergence of reality from a model may be estimated, to within a constant additive term, by a function (like the squares summed) of the deviations observed between data and the model's predictions. Estimates of such divergence for models that share the same additive term can in turn be used to select among models.|$|E
25|$|Spain has a {{division}} {{but it does}} not correspond to the division in Britain between barristers/advocates and solicitors. Procuradores represent the litigant procedurally in court, generally under the authority of a power of attorney executed by a civil law notary, while abogados represent the substantive claims of the litigant through trial advocacy. Abogados perform both transactional work and advise in connection with court proceedings, and they have full right of audience in front of the court. The court proceeding is carried out with abogados, not with procuradores. In a <b>nutshell,</b> procuradores are court agents that operate under the instructions of an abogado. Their practice is confined to the locality of the court to which they are admitted.|$|E

500|$|He later explained, [...] "In a <b>nutshell,</b> Brian wrote {{most of the}} music, and I {{composed}} most of {{the vocal}} melodies and lyrics, and then sang them." [...] If Byrne's vocal harmonies were radical enough, Eno would revise the instrumentation to accompany it, but Byrne avoided writing instrumentation and chose {{to adapt to the}} instrumentals as written. Using a style similar to the Talking Heads album SpeakinginTongues, Byrne scatted and murmured some lyrics before they were completed, due to Byrne's preference for the sonic quality of lyrics rather than their literal meaning and his method of writing lyrics using free association. In composing lyrics for the album, Byrne attempted to write keeping in mind what would please Eno as his collaborator. He also attempted to write harmonies for Eno, who decided against singing any lead vocals on the album. Eno does perform backing vocals throughout the album, which he credits on one track as [...] "inhumanpiano" ...|$|E

500|$|The railway quickly saw an {{increase}} in traffic, with an average 11 percent annual increase from the opening until the mid-1950s. In part to allow access to Kjosfossen, Kjosfossen Station was opened in 1951. By then, ridership had stabilized at 115,000 people per year. A {{significant portion of the}} traffic consisted of tourists, in part from cruise ships docked in Flåm.

I know I'm definitely not the best singer, but I think the message, the story behind the song about defying limits and borders placed by others, hopefully all that gets across with the performance.
