40|$|Along with ﬂight proﬁles, Noise-Power-Distance (NPD) curves {{are the key}} input {{variable}} for computing <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>contour</b> maps around airports. With the de- velopment of novel aircraft designs (incorporating noise reduction technologies) and new noise abatement procedures, NPD datasets will be required for assessing their potential beneﬁt in terms of noise reduction around airports. NPD curves are derived from aircraft ﬂyover noise measurements taken {{for a range of}} aircraft conﬁgurations and engine power settings. Clearly then, empirical NPD curves will be unavailable for novel aircraft designs and novel operations. This paper presents a generic framework for computationally generating NPD curves for novel aircraft and situations. The new framework derives computationally the NPD noise levels that are normally derived experimentally, by estimating noise level variations arising from technological and op- erational changes with respect to a baseline scenario, where the noise levels are known, or otherwise estimated. The framework is independent of speciﬁc prediction methods and can use any potential new model for existing or new noise sources. The paper demonstrates the methodology of the framework, discusses its beneﬁts and illustrates its applicability by deriving NPD curves for an unconventional approach operation and for a future concept blended-wing-body (BWB) aircraft. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Air traﬃc {{demand is}} {{forecast}} to signiﬁcantly grow {{during the next}} few years. To compensate for the associated potential increase of aviation environmental impact, ambitious aircraft noise and emissions reduction goals have been set by several organisations worldwide. Accommodating these goals requires planning new mitigation strategies involving technological advances, optimised ﬂight operations, and novel aircraft concepts. Methods for predicting the impact of potential mitigation strategies is vital to support eﬀective planning. This thesis presents a new framework for estimating the noise impact of mitigation strategies (i. e. involving each or both of technological and operational changes) aspiring to: a) bypass the dependance on empirical ﬂyover data and hence enable impact assessment of novel aircraft and operations, b) be independent of speciﬁc noise prediction methods and conﬁdential inputs that are normally required by many noise prediction tools, c) have low computational requirements and thus be eﬃcient in parametric studies, and d) provide inputs to emissions prediction tools, facilitating a more holistic strategic mitigation that considers various environmental concerns. The crux of the framework developed is that rather than seeking absolute noise values, it computationally estimates the noise impact of mitigation strategies, starting from a baseline scenario for which noise levels are known. This eliminates the need for measurements whilst minimising complexity and dependance on conﬁdential inputs. Noise and emissions interdependencies are incorporated by expressing noise changes as a function of thrust, which is a common inﬂuencing parameter. In addition, the framework provides means for deriving purely computational NPD curves, enabling the construction of <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>contour</b> maps for future aircraft and contemporary operations. The framework’s applicability on innovative ﬂight operations and its capability of including the interdependencies between noise and emissions is demonstrated by estimating the environmentally-optimum approach and takeoﬀ angles for civil aircraft of diﬀerent sizes. The applicability to novel aircraft is displayed through noise estimations (including noise exposure contours) for various electric aircraft featuring Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP), as well as for a Blended-Wing-Body (BWB) aircraft. The results obtained for future scenarios generally conform with the expected trends (deriving from e. g. higher-ﬁdelity tools or historical trends) highlighting the framework’s great potential and usefulness in contributing in eﬀective planning and decision-making...|$|E

40|$|Hazardous <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> {{and hearing}} loss have been {{documented}} among farmers and farm workers for many years. However, {{little is known about}} the <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> during specific agricultural work tasks and their effect on hearing loss. The objective of this dissertation was to assess the effects of specific agricultural tasks on hearing loss and their contribution to total <b>noise</b> <b>exposures.</b> Three studies were conducted to accomplish this objective. The first study examined associations between hearing sensitivity among rural residents (nfarmer = 960, nnon-farmers = 608) and self-reported years of participation in 12 agricultural tasks. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine associations between agricultural activities and hearing loss 3 ̆e 25 dB. Linear regression analysis was used to examine associations between agricultural tasks and mean decibels of hearing loss. The results indicated farmers have greater hearing loss than non-farmers. However years of participation in specific agricultural tasks was poorly associated with hearing loss. This result suggests that self-reported years engaging in specific agricultural activities may be a poor surrogate for true <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> In the second study <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> (personal dosimetry) and corresponding task data (direct observation) were collected on 18 grain farms, and mean <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> (dBA) were calculated for specific agricultural tasks. <b>Noise</b> <b>exposures</b> ranged from 78. 6 dBA to 99. 0 dBA across all tasks. The <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> for each task varied greatly (large standard deviation and maximum exposure) with most of the variability within the farms. Although specific tasks with intense <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> were identified, most comparisons of mean <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> from one task to another were not statistically different and intense exposures were present for nearly all tasks. Therefore, controlling noise only for those tasks with the greatest mean <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> may not completely eliminate hazardous exposures or the hearing loss risk. For the third study, estimates of 8 -hr time-weighted-average (TWA) <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> were calculated using time-at-task observations from one population of farmers and prior dosimeter measured mean task-based <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> from an independent population of farmers. Additionally, dosimeter measured daily <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> from the independent population of farmers were also analyzed to identify significant determinants of <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> Simple linear regression analysis was used to compare estimated and actual dosimeter-measured 8 -hr TWA <b>noise</b> <b>exposures.</b> The <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> determinants were identified by conducting multivariable linear mixed-effects regression analysis on the one-minute noise measurements from the dosimeter measured daily <b>noise</b> <b>exposures.</b> The results indicated the estimated and measured 8 -hr TWA <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> varied considerably. Therefore, the estimates were not considered reliable. Furthermore, task, number of noise sources and work area were found to have a statistically significant association with <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> In summary, hearing loss and <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> among agricultural populations are complex and cannot be completely explained by examining agricultural tasks only. More detailed evaluations of tasks are needed to increase the understanding of hearing loss and <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> in this dynamic work environment...|$|R

The objective {{of the current study}} was to evaluate the effects of recreational <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> on hearing function in young adults. A questionnaire concerning recreational <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> and an audiological test battery were completed by 163 subjects (aged 18 - 30 years). Based on the duration of exposure and self-estimated loudness of various leisure-time activities, the weekly and lifetime equivalent <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> were calculated.

Hearing was evaluated using audiometry, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). Mean differences in hearing between groups with low, intermediate, and high recreational <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

Previous studies showed that construction workers are likely exposed to high level of <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> when there is no appropriate measure is carried out. Almost all activities in construction generate noise that will affect workers health and well-being. This study is to compare the <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> level among workers in four construction sites. In addition, the research also was conducted to assess the <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> level produced from construction site activities and to explore the effect of <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> to the workers.

40|$|Chronic {{aircraft}} <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> {{in children}} {{is associated with}} impairment of reading and long-term memory. Most studies have not differentiated between day or nighttime <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> It has been hypothesized that sleep disturbance might mediate the association of aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and cognitive impairment in children. This study involves secondary analysis of data from the Munich Study and the UK Road Traffic and Aircraft <b>Noise</b> <b>Exposure</b> and Children′s Cognition and Health (RANCH) Study sample to test this. In the Munich study, 330 children were assessed on cognitive measures in three measurement waves a year apart, {{before and after the}} switchover of airports. Self-reports of sleep quality were analyzed across airports, aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and measurement wave to test whether changes in nighttime <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> had any effect on reported sleep quality, and whether this showed the same pattern as for changes in cognitive performance. For the UK sample of the RANCH study, night noise contour information was linked to the children′s home and related to sleep disturbance and cognitive performance. In the Munich study, analysis of sleep quality questions showed no consistent interactions between airport, noise, and measurement wave, suggesting that poor sleep quality does not mediate the association between <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and cognition. Daytime and nighttime aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> was highly correlated in the RANCH study. Although night <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> was significantly associated with impaired reading and recognition memory, once home night <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> was centered on daytime school <b>noise</b> <b>exposure,</b> night <b>noise</b> had no additional effect to daytime <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> These analyses took advantage of secondary data available from two studies of aircraft noise and cognition. They were not initially designed to examine sleep disturbance and cognition, and thus, there are methodological limitations which make it less than ideal in giving definitive answers to these questions. In conclusion, results from both studies suggest that night aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> does not appear to add any cognitive performance decrement to the cognitive decrement induced by daytime aircraft noise alone. We suggest that the school should be the main focus of attention for protection of children against the effects of aircraft noise on school performance...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> is associated with blood pressure changes and ischemic heart disease risk, but epidemiologic evidence is still limited. Furthermore, most reviews investigating these relations were not carried out in a systematic way, which makes them more prone to bias. We conducted a meta-analysis of 43 epidemiologic studies published between 1970 and 1999 that investigate the relation between <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> (both occupational and community) and blood pressure and/or ischemic heart disease (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes 410 – 414). We studied a wide range of effects, from blood pressure changes to a myocardial infarction. With respect to the association between <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and blood pressure, small blood pressure differences were evident. Our meta-analysis showed a significant association for both occupational <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and air traffic <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and hypertension: We estimated relative risks per 5 dB(A) noise increase of 1. 14 (1. 01 – 1. 29) and 1. 26 (1. 14 – 1. 39), respectively. Air traffic <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> was positively associated with the consultation of a general practitioner or specialist, the use of cardiovascular medicines, and angina pectoris. In cross-sectional studies, road traffic <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> increases the risk of myocardial infarction and total ischemic heart disease. Although we can conclude that <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> can contribute to the prevalence of cardiovascular disease, the evidence for a relation between <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and ischemic heart disease is still inconclusive because of the limitations in exposure characterization, adjustment for important confounders, and the occurrence of publication bias.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the {{existence}} of an association between child blood pressure (BP) and exposure to domestic jet aircraft noise in the context of the construction of a new parallel north-south runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. The baseline study was commissioned and funded by the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC), with measurements conducted in 1994 and 1995. A follow-up longitudinal component to the study was subsequently commissioned and funded by the FAC in 1997, and measurements conducted in the same year. As the same individuals were measured and re-measured over changing conditions of <b>exposure</b> to aircraft <b>noise,</b> the quasiexperimental nature of the study allowed inferences to be made regarding <b>exposure</b> to aircraft <b>noise</b> and child BP. The main hypotheses for testing were that BP, and within-subject longitudinal changes in BP, are positively related to domestic jet aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and longitudinal changes in domestic jet aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> respectively. Subsidiary hypotheses tested for evidence of short- and long-term BP adaptation effects where BPs were related to prior changes to aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposures.</b> A sample of 75 primary schools within a 20 km radius of Sydney Airport under various <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> conditions, both existing and those projected with the advent of the new runway, participated in the study. The baseline cohort comprised 1, 230 Year 3 / 4 children attending the schools in 1994 and 1995, and the follow-up participants comprised 628 of the original baseline sample re-measured in 1997. Study participants were enrolled by active parental consent. The baseline response rate was approximately 40 % of children in the participating schools. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure readings of the children were taken using automated BP measuring equipment along with anthropometric measurements (heights, weights, skinfold thicknesses and waist measurements). Parental surveys captured items pertaining to the child�s ethnic background as measured by the country of birth of the child and parent(s), residential address and housing structure, child eating habits and activity levels, along with family and child history of high blood pressure. Aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> data were collected by the National Acoustic Laboratories and processed into the energy-averaged noise metric used in Australia for aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> assessment called the Australian <b>Noise</b> <b>Exposure</b> Index (ANEI). Mean exposures for a given calendar month were used in the analysis. ANEI values were geocoded to exact geographic locations using digitised street maps from which values for each house and school address, also geocoded, were interpolated. A child BP measured in a given month was matched to a aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> value both at their school and residential address for that month for analysis. After adjusting for confounding and other factors, the cross-sectional relationship between BP and aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> was found to be inconsistent. SBP was nonsignificantly negatively associated with school aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> at baseline (0. 05 mmHg/ANEI, cluster-sampling-adjusted p> 0. 05), but positively and non-significantly associated with school aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> at follow-up (0. 05 mmHg/ANEI, p> 0. 05). As for SBP, baseline DBP was significantly negatively related to school aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> at (0. 09 mmHg/ANEI, p 0. 05). Within-subject BP changes, occurring from baseline to follow-up, regressed on corresponding longitudinal changes in aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> produced inconsistent results. SBP change was positively and non-significantly (0. 027 mmHg/ANEI, p> 0. 05) associated with corresponding school aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> change, while SBP change was negatively associated total aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> change (statistically nonsignificant, 0. 06 mmHg/ANEI, p> 0. 05). DBP changes were similarly and nonsignificantly related to corresponding aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> changes. Some evidence for short-term BP adaptation to recent changes in aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> was found. Consistent negative associations between systolic and diastolic BP and recent changes in school aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> were found. This association was statistically significant at study baseline (SBP: 0. 19 mmHg/ANEI, p 0. 05). In the presence of inconsistent cross-sectional BP-aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> associations, this finding is consistent with evidence of a homoeostatic BP response to recent changes in aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure,</b> where resting BP returns to pre-existing levels unrelated to aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> The public health implication of this finding appears to be benign...|$|R

RESULTS: After pooling the data, aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> at school was related to a statistically non-significant increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> at home was related to a statistically significant increase in blood pressure. Aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> during the night at home was positively and significantly associated with blood pressure. The findings differed between the Dutch and British samples. Negative associations were found between road traffic <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and blood pressure, which cannot be explained. CONCLUSION: On the basis of this study and previous scientific literature, no unequivocal conclusions can be drawn about the relationship between community noise and children's blood pressure...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the impact of}} acoustic injury on the cochlea by assessing auditory brain-stem response (ABR) threshold shifts, outer hair cells, {{and the number of}} synaptic ribbons before and after <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> The ABR threshold was elevated immediately after <b>noise</b> <b>exposure,</b> but recovered over time; 14 days after noise exposure,the ABR threshold was approximately 15 dB higher than before exposure. There were few damaged outer hair cells. The number of synapses directly under inner hair cells markedly decreased immediately after <b>noise</b> <b>exposure,</b> but then exhibited early signs of recovery. Twenty-four hours after <b>noise</b> <b>exposure,</b> the number of synapses was higher than before exposure. Subsequently, synapse number decreased. Seven days after <b>noise</b> <b>exposure,</b> synapes number was lower than before exposure. In this acoustic injury model, although the synapses were damaged, as described in the previous reports on the temporary threshold shift (TTS), the regeneration of synapses was promoted soon thereafter. There appears to be a point during the repair process when the number of synapses temporarily increases. This model {{is considered to be a}} partially reversible synaptic damage model. This study revealed an association between the intensity of <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and the severity of functional and histological damage...|$|R

Since the most negative effects caused by <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> {{are related to}} the hearing system and it may produce professional deafness or even permanent deafness. It is necessary to assess the <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and to develop mechanisms for studying and proposing preventive solutions for minimizing environmental pollution. Equivalent <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> of drivers at work and in-auto noise are evaluated using a precision dosimeter in different areas or locations of various times like summer and rainy seasons etc. Readings were taken in different routes in north Kolkata, India and the noise doses are analyzed. The A-weighted values of Leq (12), L 10, L 90, TWA (Time weighted Average) and TNI (Traffic Noise Index) are determined. It shows significant effect of <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> from auto-rickshaws in Kolkata city of India.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{relationship}} between <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and risk of occupational injury. Materials and Methods: Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was used for the current study. Self-report questionnaires were used to investigate occupational injury and <b>exposure</b> to <b>noise,</b> chemicals, and machines and equipments. Results: In separate analyses for occupation and occupational hazard, the proportion of occupational injuries increased according to severity of <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> (all P < 0. 05). Compared to the non-exposure group, the respective odds ratio (95 % confidence intervals) for occupational injury was 1. 39 (1. 07 – 1. 80) and 1. 67 (1. 13 – 2. 46) in the mild and severe <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> groups, after controlling for age, gender, sleep hours, work schedule (shift work), and exposure status to hazardous chemicals and hazardous machines and equipments. Conclusions: The current study highlights the association between <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and risk of occupational injury.

40|$|AbstractCross-sectional {{evidence}} that environmental <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> at school shows negative associations with children's cognition and health has increased, yet longitudinal evidence is lacking. This study examined longitudinal associations of aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> at primary school on children's reading comprehension, noise annoyance, and psychological health at secondary school. This six-year follow-up of 461 children aged 15 – 16 years, who attended {{primary and secondary}} schools around London Heathrow airport, used annual average aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> at the schools from noise contour maps. Multilevel regression modelling showed that aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> at primary school {{was associated with a}} significant increase in noise annoyance and with a non-significant decrease in reading comprehension at follow-up. Aircraft noise at primary school was not associated with psychological health at follow-up. This is the first longitudinal study of its type, suggesting that aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> at school might impair reading comprehension, as well as increase noise annoyance in children...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} into the effect of Carbogen (95 % O 2 / 5 % CO 2), 5 % CO 2 /air, and 100 % oxygen on cochlear threshold shifts caused by noise was undertaken. Five groups of eight pigmented guinea pigs were exposed to 105 dB broad band noise for 6 h per day for five consecutive days with each group receiving the various gaseous mixtures either during <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> or for 1 h immediately after <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> A control group received the same <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> but respired air. Auditory threshold shifts, {{as measured by the}} auditory evoked brainstem response, were measured at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 kHz. Recordings were taken pre-exposure and at Day 1, 3, 5, and Weeks 2 and 3 after <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> Carbogen, given during <b>noise</b> <b>exposure,</b> resulted in a trend toward less post <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> threshold shift (as compared to controls) which reached statistical significance by Week 3 at all frequencies except 2 and 20 kHz. Subjects given Carbogen after exposure also showed a general trend toward decreased noise induced threshold shifts, as compared to controls, but this was not statistically significant. The mixture of 5 % CO 2 /air given during <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> yielded no difference in threshold shifts as compared to controls. When 100 % oxygen was administered during <b>noise</b> <b>exposure,</b> a marked decrease in noise induced threshold shifts could be seen as compared to controls, with differences reaching statistical significance by day 5 at most frequencies. These results indicate that oxygen (i. e. cochlear-oxygenation) is a more important factor than CO 2 (i. e., as a vasodilator) in protection of the cochlea from noise induced damage...|$|R
40|$|Background. Due to {{concerns}} regarding {{safety and health}} in the work environment of the Royal Norwegian Navy (RNoN), a questionnaire-based survey was conducted (2002 – 2003) to assess work-related risk factors and health problems among Navy personnel. Results from this questionnaire study showed <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> as an important risk factor, and impaired hearing as an important health problem among Navy personnel. Also foreign navy studies point at <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> as a prevalent risk factor and hearing loss as a common health complaint among navy personnel. However, the literature concerning <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and hearing loss in the navy is sparse and the issue has not been systematically investigated. The RNoN has experienced several accidents at sea. These accidents {{have been found to}} be associated with cognitive requirements regarding navigational task performance. Prior literature has indicated deleterious effects of <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> on cognitive performance. Thus, an association between RNoN navigation accidents and impaired cognitive performance due to <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> has been questioned. However, research on <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and cognitive performance in naval and maritime settings is limited and shows contradicting results. Objectives. The main objective of this thesis was to gain more knowledge regarding the effects of <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> among navy personnel. The specific objectives of paper I were to assess the prevalence of hearing loss among Navy personnel and to examine the association between work on board vessels in the RNoN and hearing loss among Navy personnel. In paper II we aimed at investigating the incidence of significant threshold shift (STS) among Navy personnel between 2012 and 2014 and to identify determinants of STS among Navy personnel. The objective of paper III was to assess cognitive performance subsequent to <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> among Navy personnel on board RNoN vessels. Material and methods. 938 officers, enlisted and civilian Navy personnel from 48 vessels were invited to participate in a study on the relationship between noise and hearing loss. The study was conducted between 2012 and 2014 and comprised two examinations per person, i. e. at baseline and follow-up. Two separate questionnaires on <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> and health were prepared, one for each examination. Hearing was assessed by pure tone audiometry. At baseline, hearing loss was defined as hearing thresholds ≥ 25 dB in either ear at 3000, 4000 or 6000 Hz. At follow up, impaired hearing was defined as a STS, i. e. an average change in hearing thresholds between the two examinations ≥ + 10 dB at 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz in either ear. Two to five Navy personnel on board 24 RNoN vessels were selected to participate in a study on the effects of <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> on cognitive performance. <b>Noise</b> <b>exposure</b> was assessed by personal noise dosimeter measurements, while cognitive performance was evaluated by using a visual attention test in which response time (RT) was measured. In order to assess possible confounding factors, the participants completed a log book. Results. The prevalence of hearing loss among Navy personnel at baseline was 31. 4 %. Work on board RNoN vessels was significantly associated with reduced hearing after adjusting for age, gender and otitis as an adult. The incidence of STS from baseline to follow-up was 23. 0 %. The <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> determinants ‘current <b>exposure</b> to loud <b>noise</b> > 15 hours/week during work on board’ and ‘number of gun shots during the last year’ were significantly associated with a higher risk of STS. A significantly increased RT was found among participants with the highest <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> (> 85. 2 dB(A)) and the next highest <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> (77. 1 – 85. 2 dB(A)) compared to participants with the lowest exposure ( 15 hours/week on board RNoN vessels. We also found a significant association between STS and number of gun shots during the last year. The Navy personnel with the highest <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> performed poorer on a cognitive performance test than personnel with the lowest <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> It is likely that <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> on RNoN vessels causes hearing loss and affects cognitive performance among the Navy personnel on board...|$|R
40|$|Purpose <b>Noise</b> <b>exposure</b> is an {{important}} and highly prevalent occupational hazard in the construction industry. This study examines hearing threshold levels of a large population of Dutch construction workers and compares their hearing thresholds to those predicted by ISO- 1999. Methods In this retrospective study, medical records of periodic occupational health examinations of 29, 644 construction workers are analysed. Pure-tone audiometric thresholds of noise-exposed workers are compared to a non-exposed control group and to ISO- 1999 predictions. Regression analyses are conducted to explore the relationship between hearing loss and <b>noise</b> intensity, <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> time {{and the use of}} hearing protection. Results Noise-exposed workers had greater hearing losses compared to their non-noise-exposed colleagues and to the reference population reported in ISO- 1999. <b>Noise</b> <b>exposure</b> explained only a small proportion of hearing loss. When the daily <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> level rose from 80 dB(A) towards 96 dB(A), only a minor increase in hearing loss is shown. The relation of exposure time and hearing loss found was similar to ISO- 1999 predictions when looking at durations of 10 years or more. For the first decade, the population medians show poorer hearing than predicted by ISO- 1999. Discussion Duration of <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> was a better predictor than <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> levels, probably because of the limitations in <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> estimations. In this population, noise-induced hearing loss was already present at the beginning of employment and increased {{at the same rate as}} is predicted for longer exposure duration...|$|R
40|$|An {{estimate}} of lifetime <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> {{was used as}} the primary predictor of performance on a range of behavioral tasks: frequency and intensity difference limens, amplitude modulation detection, interaural phase discrimination, the digit triplet speech test, the co-ordinate response speech measure, an auditory localization task, a musical consonance task and a subjective report of hearing ability. One hundred and thirty-eight participants (81 females) aged 18 – 36 years were tested, {{with a wide range of}} self-reported <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> All had normal pure-tone audiograms up to 8 kHz. It was predicted that increased lifetime <b>noise</b> <b>exposure,</b> which we assume to be concordant with noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy, would elevate behavioral thresholds, in particular for stimuli with high levels in a high spectral region. However, the results showed little effect of <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> on performance. There were a number of weak relations with <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> across the test battery, although many of these were in the opposite direction to the predictions, and none were statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons. There were also no strong correlations between electrophysiological measures of synaptopathy published previously and the behavioral measures reported here. Consistent with our previous electrophysiological results, the present results provide no evidence that <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> is related to significant perceptual deficits in young listeners with normal audiometric hearing. It is possible that the effects of noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy are only measurable in humans with extreme <b>noise</b> <b>exposures,</b> and that these effects always co-occur with a loss of audiometric sensitivity...|$|R

E-waste recycling is a green industry of emerging importance, especially in low-and middle-income countries where much of this recycling work is performed, and where many people’s livelihoods depend on this work. The occupational health hazards of e-waste recycling have not been adequately explored. We performed a cross-sectional study of <b>noise</b> <b>exposures,</b> heart rate, and perceived stress among e-waste recycling workers at a large e-waste site in Accra, Ghana. We interviewed 57 workers and continuously monitored their individual <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> and heart rates for up to 24 h. More than 40 % of workers had <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> that exceeded recommended occupational (85 dBA) and community (70 dBA) <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> limits, and self-reported hearing difficulties were common. Workers also had moderate {{to high levels of}} perceived stress as measured via Cohen’s Perceived Stress Scale, and reported a variety of symptoms that could indicate cardiovascular disease. <b>Noise</b> <b>exposures</b> were moderately and significantly correlated with heart rate (Spearman’s ρ 0. 46, p < 0. 001). A mixed effects linear regression model indicated that a 1 dB increase in <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> was associated with a 0. 17 increase in heart rate (p-value = 0. 01) even after controlling for work activities, age, smoking, perceived stress, and unfavorable physical working conditions.

40|$|There {{have been}} several {{previous}} studies into daily <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> levels in modern urban communities, which typically report mean <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> levels (L sub(Aeq)) for adults between 73 and 79 dB. In this study, rather than focus on group mean exposures across a wide age range, individual patterns of <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> over 4 - and 5 -day periods were examined {{in a group of}} 45 young adults aged 18 - 35 years. The main objective {{of the study was to}} determine the extent to which young adults exhibit a 'binge listening' pattern of <b>noise</b> <b>exposure,</b> i. e., high weekend leisure noise vs. low weekday work <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> A secondary objective was to identify the types of activities that generate the highest <b>noise</b> <b>exposures.</b> The results showed that although most participants (60 %) were exposed to low daily noise levels, 33 % of participants exhibited a 'binge listening' exposure pattern characterized by one or two high-noise days, usually a Friday, Saturday or Sunday, preceded or followed by much quieter days. The most notable high-noise activities were playing an instrument solo or in a band; attending a nightclub; and attending a pop concert, each of which recorded average noise levels greater than the chronic exposure presupposed in traditional risk models, however, under the equal-energy principle, repeated 'binge' <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> from weekend visits to nightclubs, live music events and other high-noise represent a significant risk to long-term hearing health. 5 page(s...|$|R
