50|$|When {{building}} new railways or extensive reinvestments {{are made to}} the existing railway infrastructure, the gauge is expanded to SE-C that also accepts UIC GC. The structure gauge on {{the bulk of the}} system already (2012) allows large cars built to SE-C, albeit with restrictions and a special permit. The remaining limitation is the track circuits, the blocks are <b>not</b> <b>dimensioned</b> for the extra width and a large car placed to close to a turnout at a passing loop may intrude on the structure envelope of the through line. As a stop-gap this is generally solved by adding an extra normal-sized car at the tail-end to ensure that no part of the consist obstruct the space needed by passing trains (the engine serves the same function at the front-end). The larger cars are also barred from using certain industrial spurs leading to warehouses or loading docks built for the narrower cars.|$|E

In order to enable efficient centralized and cooperative processing, FH links must offer huge bandwidth, very low latency and jitter, and very tight synchronization. Unfortunately, the practical FH is often capacity-constrained or time-delay constrained [13]. Furthermore, FH networks mainly use dedicated, point-to-point fiber links {{with a very}} high capacity, which make FH networks inflexible and expensive to deploy.

40|$|M. Tech. : Electrical Engineering. Ordinary {{dial-up access}} to the Internet over a public {{switched}} telephone network forces the telephone network to carry traffic volumes for which it was <b>not</b> <b>dimensioned</b> and can cause serious problems of congestion and {{access to the}}se networks. Significant advantages in the implementation of MultiGain Wireless (MGW) Local Loop (LL) systems in South Africa make data communication possible over large geographical areas where no such services existedpreviously. The main objective of the dissertation was to determine effective traffic estimation values for the voice band data requirements of dial-up data traffic with reference to available standard voice traffic estimation (Erlang) tables for rural and suburban areas in South Africa. Three MGW fixed wireless access prototype networks (case studies) were designed and implemented in the Upington, Bloemfontein and Magaliesburg districts, respectively. Analysis of three networks revealed that the traffic loading per sector significantly depends on service requirements (voice for residential and business and data for residential and business subscribers and public payphones), population subscriber numbers and terrain characteristics. A series of mathematical-analytical equations were derived utilising these parameters and that could enable a better economic and efficiency of subsequently rollout networks. Specific empirical constants and terrain values were derived, based on statistical data as acquired from the case studies. Recommended traffic estimation values for each subscriber type were found to be as follows: 40 mE for residential 32 kbps subscribers, 80 mE for business 32 kbps subscribers, 80 mE for dial-up data 64 kbps residential subscribers, 120 mE for dial-up data 64 kbps business subscribers and 180 mE for payphones. Subsequent business case studies, revealed cost savings of up to 25 percent (on average 11. 5 percent) capital and operational savings that can be achieved for follow-up networks if these recommendations are implemented. The impact of these results on the social and economic development in South Africa could be significant. Specific advantages as identified wrt the implementation of MGWLL in South Africa are as follows: (i) the flexibility of the deployed wireless system; (ii) the highly modular nature of the technology; (iii) immunity to theft compared to ordinary copper network infrastructure; (iv) reliability; and (v) provision of data communications not susceptible to line losses due to weather and other parameters...|$|E

40|$|In {{the search}} to {{accommodate}} increasing shares {{of renewable energy}} into today's electricity system, demand response has received renewed research attention. At the same time, the introduction of charging electric vehicles (EVs) at residential locations highlights the fact that current distribution grids were <b>not</b> <b>dimensioned</b> for the coinciding activation of such large loads. Solutions are needed that safeguard the state of distribution grids {{and at the same}} time allow large-scale demand response based on market objectives. In this thesis, scenarios are investigated where demand response of EVs is problematic for the state of the grid, and an algorithm is developed for demand response of charging EVs. This agent-based algorithm allows to integrate typical market objectives with the hard constraints at the distribution grid level. Through simulations, the severity of the conflict between market and technical objectives is examined, and the use of voltage droop control as possible solution is evaluated. 1 Introduction 1. 1 Smart grids 1. 2 Demand Response 1. 3 Ancillary services 1. 4 Challenges & requirements 1. 5 Outline & context 2 Electric Vehicles & Communication 2. 1 Charging of EVs and limitations 2. 2 Standardization efforts 2. 3 Vehicle-grid communication 2. 4 Conclusion 3 Algorithms for Demand Response of Electric Vehicles 3. 1 Distributed DR algorithms 3. 2 Centralized DR algorithms 3. 3 Aggregate & dispatch DR algorithms 3. 4 Conclusion on the DR algorithms 3. 5 Distribution grid congestion 3. 6 Ancillary services and grid support 3. 7 Conclusion 4 Simulator for Demand-Response Interaction 4. 1 Structure overview 4. 2 Data logging and Matlab interface 4. 3 Loadflow simulation 4. 4 Data models 4. 5 Conclusion 5 Multi-Agent Market-Based Control for Electric Vehicle Charging 5. 1 MAS MBC 5. 2 Multi-agent MBC with planning 5. 3 Shortcomings 5. 4 Conclusion 6 Event-based Multi-Agent Market-Based Control: RT-MBC 6. 1 Introduction 6. 2 Dual coordination 6. 3 Event-based interaction 6. 4 Energy compensation 6. 5 Conclusion 7 Validation 7. 1 Demand function evaluation 7. 2 Communication limitations 7. 3 Conclusion 8 Market-setting Applications 8. 1 Problem description 8. 2 Grid topology and agent structure 8. 3 ToU coordinated charging 8. 4 ToU coordinated charging, passive distribution grid 8. 5 ToU coordinated charging, active distribution grid 8. 6 Balancing case 8. 7 Balancing case, passive distribution grid 8. 8 Balancing case, active distribution grid 8. 9 Multi-aggregator case 8. 10 Multi-aggregator case with active distribution grid 9 Conclusions and Future Work 9. 1 Summary of the chapters 9. 2 Conclusions regarding the research objectives 9. 3 Future work A Extended Load Flow Results B Balancing casestatus: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In the {{collaborative}} forum Positive footprint housing® Riksbyggen is building the Viva residential quarter, {{which is a}} sustainability project at the very forefront of what is possible with contemporary construction. The idea is that this residential quarter should be fully sustainable in ecological, economic and social terms. Since 2013, a number of pilot studies have been completed {{under the auspices of}} the Viva project framework thanks to financing from the Swedish Energy Agency. The various building frame alternatives that have been evaluated are precast concrete, cast in-situ concrete and solid wood, all proposed by leading commercial suppliers. The report includes a specific requirement for equivalent functions during the use phase of the building, B. An interpretation has been provided that investigates the building engineering aspects in detail, as well as an account of the results based on the social community requirements specified in Viva, durability, fire, noise and energy consumption in the Swedish National Board of Building, Planning and Housing building regulations (BBR), plus Riksbyggen’s own requirements, Sweden Green Building Council’s Environmental Building Gold (Miljöbyggnad Guld) and 100 -year life cycle. Given that the alternatives have different long-term characteristics (and also that our knowledge of these characteristics itself varies), these functional requirements have been addressed by setting up different scenarios in accordance with the EPD standard EN 15978. Because Riksbyggen has specified a requirement for a 100 -year life cycle, we have also opted for an analysis period of 100 years. The results show no significant differences between concrete and timber structures for the same functions during the life cycle, either for climate or for primary energy. The minor differences reported are accordingly less than the degree of uncertainty involved in the study. The available documentation on the composition of the relevant intumescent paint coating on solid wood frames differs from source to source, so it was not possible to fully allow for the significance of this. The LCA has not included functional changes in the building linked to load-bearing characteristics, noise, moisture, health or other problems that may result in increased maintenance and replacement. The concrete houses have been dimensioned for 100 years, for instance, in accordance with tried and tested standards and experience. The solid wood house is <b>not</b> <b>dimensioned</b> in the same way, and this has led to us having to assume various scenarios. The results also show the following:   • The uncertainties involved in comparing different structures and alternative solutions are very significant. The results are affected by factors such as life cycle, the functional requirements taken into consideration, transportation, design and structural details, etc.   • Variations in the built items and a considerable degree of uncertainty in the assumptions make it difficult to obtain significant results on comparisons. Only actual construction projects with known specific data, declared from a life cycle perspective that takes into account actual building developer requirements and involving different scenarios (best, documented and worst-case) for the user stage can currently be compared.   • In the other hand, comparisons restricted to different concrete structures only, or to different timber structures only, ought to involve a lower degree of uncertainty, These would then provide results that are significant as well as improvement requirements that are relevant.   • There is potential for improving concrete by imposing requirements on the material   • There is potential for improving solid wood frames by developing and guaranteeing well-documented long-term characteristics for all functional requirements.   The LCAs were performed as an iterative process where all parties were given the opportunity to submit their viewpoints and suggestions for changes during the course of the work. This helped ensure that all alternatives have been properly thought through. Because, during the project, Riksbyggen opted to procure a concrete frame, in the final stage the researchers involved focused on ensuring the procurement process would result in the concrete frame as built meeting the requirements set out above. As things currently stand, the material requirements for the concrete are limited by the production options open to the suppliers, and this is therefore being investigated in the manufacture of precast concrete frames for the Viva cooperative housing association. ...|$|E
