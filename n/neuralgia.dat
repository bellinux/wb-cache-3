5|$|Apart from headache, about 50% of {{patients}} experience neck pain or stiffness, nausea, and vomiting. Other symptoms include dizziness and vertigo, facial numbness or weakness, unusually blurry or double vision, <b>neuralgia,</b> fatigue, or a metallic taste in the mouth.

40|$|Craniocervical pains can be {{analyzed}} in two groups: cranial <b>neuralgias</b> and cervicogenic pains. Cranial <b>neuralgias</b> are with neuropathic character; however, their etiologies might be atypical, idiopathic and psychogenic. Generally, it can be experienced as one-sided lightning strikes, electric shock-like and stabbing pain. The paroxysmal pains originate from nerves with somatic afferent fibers, such as trigeminal, facial, glossopharingeal, vagus, and also sometimes from the C 2 - 3 dorsal roots. Moreover, the most commonly seen are trigeminal <b>neuralgias.</b> Cervicogenic pains are caused by cervical spinal nerves, pathologies {{of the structure of}} the cervical intervertebral disc, cervical facet joints and the soft tissue of these areas.

5|$|Trigeminal <b>neuralgia</b> occurs {{later in}} life, from middle age onwards, most often after age 60, {{and is a}} {{condition}} typically associated with very strong pain distributed over the area innervated by the maxillary or mandibular nerve divisions of the trigeminal nerve (V2 and V3).|$|E
5|$|Pain: {{acute pain}} is mainly due to optic {{neuritis}} (with corticosteroids {{being the best}} treatment available), as well as trigeminal <b>neuralgia,</b> Lhermitte's sign, or dysesthesias. Subacute pain is usually secondary to the disease and can be a consequence of spending too long in the same position, urinary retention, and infected skin ulcers, amongst others. Treatment will depend on cause. Chronic pain is very common and harder to treat as its most common cause is dysesthesias. Acute pain due to trigeminal <b>neuralgia</b> is usually successfully treated with anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or phenytoin. Both Lhermitte's sign and painful dysesthesias usually respond to treatment with carbamazepine, clonazepam, or amitriptyline. Sativex is approved for treatment of pain in MS in different countries, but due to its derivation from cannabis, it is currently not available in others, such as the USA. This medication is also being investigated {{for the management of}} other MS symptoms, such as spasticity, and has shown long-term safety and efficacy.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} trigeminal <b>neuralgia,</b> {{in which one}} side of the face is exquisitely painful, is thought to be {{compression}} of the nerve by an artery as the nerve emerges from the brain stem. An acoustic neuroma, particularly at the junction between the pons and medulla, may compress the facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII), leading to hearing and sensory loss on the affected side.|$|E

2500|$|A.K.Tolstoy {{entered the}} 1870s {{as a very}} sick man, {{suffering}} from asthma, angina pectoris, <b>neuralgias</b> and severe headaches. Regular visits to European medics only temporarily alleviated his conditions. In the spring of 1875 Tolstoy started taking morphine. [...] "Now I'm feeling much better, at least the <b>neuralgia's</b> gone. But never before have I been so short of breath. Asthma fits are continuous," [...] he complained {{in a letter to}} poet Karolina Pavlova (who was also a translator of his dramas) on 8 July 1875.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{physicians}} thought low back pain was caused by inflammation of or damage to the nerves, with <b>neuralgia</b> and neuritis frequently mentioned by them in the medical literature of the time. The popularity of such proposed causes decreased during the 20th century. In the early 20th century, American neurosurgeon Harvey Williams Cushing increased the acceptance of surgical treatments for low back pain. In the 1920s and 1930s, new theories of the cause arose, with physicians proposing a combination of nervous system and psychological disorders such as nerve weakness (neurasthenia) and female hysteria. Muscular rheumatism (now called fibromyalgia) was also cited with increasing frequency.|$|E
5|$|MacLaren played little cricket in 1898, {{initially}} {{owing to}} his teaching commitments {{and the need}} to establish himself and his wife in a new home. After making his first appearance in July, he did not play again until August. He played nine first-class games, scoring 478 runs at 29.87, before his season was ended by <b>neuralgia.</b> Despite his frequent absences—again he missed {{the first part of the}} season—Lancashire re-appointed MacLaren as joint captain for 1899. That summer, the Australians toured England and the first Test took place before MacLaren had played any cricket. For the second game, MacLaren replaced W. G. Grace as England captain; the other candidate for the leadership was Stanley Jackson, who was senior to MacLaren at Harrow and had preceded him into the England side, but MacLaren was favoured owing to his previous experience in the role with Lancashire and England.|$|E
5|$|The 5th Division was out {{of action}} for some months. It finally moved {{with the rest of}} the I Anzac Corps to the Somme sector in October. After months of {{fighting}} and recent rain, the front line area was a devastated muddy morass. McCay was ordered to undertake an attack with the 2nd Division's 7th Infantry Brigade at Flers, which cost 819 casualties and gained no ground. Once again, McCay's handling of his division showed poor planning and tactics. Moreover, at Flers he showed that he had not learned from the lessons of Fromelles. His relief was now only a matter of time. Nonetheless, McCay remained in command of the 5th Division until 18 December 1916 when he was granted medical leave in the United Kingdom for treatment on his leg, which the doctors diagnosed as <b>neuralgia.</b> Birdwood took the opportunity of removing McCay, ostensibly on medical grounds. McCay was mentioned in despatches a third time.|$|E
40|$|Cluster {{headache}} is a {{rare and}} severe pain syndrome with elusive pathophysiology.

Pharmacologic interventions for this patient were examined in conjunction with current classification, location and function of serotonin receptors.

5|$|On May 23, 1839, Waller married Philadelphian Julia Ellmaker. He {{first met}} Ellmaker while visiting friends in Philadelphia {{during his time}} at the Princeton Theological Seminary. The couple had nine {{children}} between 1840 and 1858, six of whom survived to adulthood, and five of whom were alive {{at the time of}} his death. He lived at the corner of 5th and Market Streets in Bloomsburg, although at one point he owned much of the land between 4th Street, the Susquehanna River, Railroad Street, and Ferry Road in Bloomsburg. In 1871, he suffered a driving accident and was temporarily injured. He was in another accident in 1875 and due to this, he needed to walk with crutches for the remainder of his life. Waller also suffered from rheumatism and <b>neuralgia</b> due to extensive traveling. He retired from being a minister on April 16, 1871. He died in on December 7, 1893, at the age of 79. The services for his death were held in his home. The historian J.H. Battle made note of Waller's hospitality. He was interested in geology and another Presbyterian minister gave him a large mineralogy-related collection in 1848.|$|E
