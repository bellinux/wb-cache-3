40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the legal issues}} related to software assistance and maintenance agreements. Contracts generally provide for highly diverse performances and are aimed at providing a global service. Since the assistance and maintenance agreement generally entails a long-term relationship, the regulations for long-term supply contract’s apply. Nevertheless, in specific circumstances, even the rules for service contracts may be applied. In Italy, like in other EU jurisdictions, the applicable regulatory framework depends {{on the content of}} the contract. The provider company naturally tends to restrict its liability in proportion to effectively commissioned activity. Exclusion clauses including intentional damage or gross negligence are void, while par. 2 of Article 1229 of the Italian Civil Code permits limitation of liability in cases of minor negligence. The impossibility of changing contractual terms disadvantages the weaker contracting party and the procedure imposed by par 2 of Art. 1341 c. c. has proved inadequate to protect the customer. Art. 9, of Law n 192 of 18 June 1998 (“Disciplina della subfornitura nelle attività produttive”), which is now considered to be general principle allows exclusion clauses providing for minor negligence to be deemed void, if they oversimplify the debtor position, by defining the requirements of minor <b>negligence.</b> In addition, <b>clauses</b> regarding exclusion or limitation of liability towards third parties, beyond the limit set by Art. 1229, require an assessment based {{on the nature of the}} interest which is concretely protected...|$|R
2500|$|One it is {{established}} which terms {{are incorporated into}} an agreement, their meaning must be determined. Since the introduction of legislation regulating unfair terms, English courts have become firmer in their general guiding principle that agreements are construed {{to give effect to}} the intentions of the parties from the standpoint of a reasonable person. This changed significantly from the early 20th century, when English courts had become enamoured with a literalist theory of interpretation, championed in part by Lord Halsbury. As greater concern grew around the mid-20th century over unfair terms, and particularly exclusion clauses, the courts swung to the opposite position, utilising heavily the doctrine of contra proferentum. Ambiguities in clauses excluding or limiting one party's liability would be construed against the person relying on it. In the leading case, Canada Steamship Lines Ltd v R the Crown's shed in Montreal harbour burnt down, destroying goods owned by Canada Steamship lines. Lord Morton held that a clause in the contract limiting the Crown's excluding liability for [...] "damage... to... goods... being... in the said shed" [...] was not enough to excuse it from liability for <b>negligence</b> because the <b>clause</b> could also be construed as referring to strict liability under another contract clause. It would exclude that instead. Some judges, and in particular Lord Denning wished to go further by introducing a rule of [...] "fundamental breach of contract" [...] whereby no liability for very serious breaches of contract could be excluded at all. While the rules remain ready for application where statute may not help, such hostile approaches to interpretation were generally felt to run contrary to the plain meaning of language.|$|R
