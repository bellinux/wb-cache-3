50|$|Where {{mosquito}} nets are freely or cheaply distributed, {{local residents}} sometimes opportunistically use them inappropriately, for example as fishing nets. When used for fishing, mosquito nets have harmful ecological consequences because the fine mesh of a mosquito <b>net</b> <b>retains</b> almost all fishes, including bycatch such as immature or small fish and fish {{species that are}} not suitable for consumption. In addition, insecticides with which the mesh has been treated, such as permethrin, may be harmful to the fish and other aquatic fauna.|$|R

50|$|In {{an effort}} to start anew, Coleman and Anderson were both traded during the 1995-96 season and New Jersey hired UMass head coach John Calipari to coach the team. Kerry Kittles was {{selected}} in the 1996 NBA draft and midway through the 1996-97 season, the team traded for Sam Cassell. After a 26-56 season, the Nets made a major draft-day trade in June 1997, acquiring Keith Van Horn, Lucious Harris and two other players for Tim Thomas. The only player from the early 1990s that the <b>Nets</b> <b>retained</b> was Jayson Williams, who was developing into a rebounding specialist.|$|R

It had removable combat-style boots, also made of Nomex fabric, along with a full-pressure helmet (containing a set of earphones and microphones) and gloves detachable by improved locking rings that allowed easy rotation of the wrists.

In the middle of both widths of IFCAS, two pits filled with dried pond mud of the same pond are used as medium for vegetable plantation. On the top of the structure, a scaffold was made using split bamboo and net for vegetables to climb on.|$|R
40|$|We study a {{new class}} of networks, {{generated}} by sequences of letters taken from a finite alphabet consisting of $m$ letters (corresponding to $m$ types of nodes) and a fixed set of connectivity rules. Recently, it was shown how a binary alphabet might generate threshold nets in a similar fashion [Hagberg et al., Phys. Rev. E 74, 056116 (2006) ]. Just like threshold nets, sequence nets in general possess a modular structure reminiscent of everyday life nets, and are easy to handle analytically (i. e., calculate degree distribution, shortest paths, betweenness centrality, etc.). Exploiting symmetry, we make a full classification of two- and three-letter sequence nets, discovering two new classes of two-letter sequence nets. The new sequence <b>nets</b> <b>retain</b> many of the desirable analytical properties of threshold nets while yielding richer possibilities for the modeling of everyday life complex networks more faithfully...|$|R

50|$|The growing {{accuracy}} {{and rate of}} fire of rifles, together with {{the invention of the}} Gatling gun in 1862 and the Maxim machine gun in 1883, meant that close order line infantry would suffer huge losses before being able to close with their foe, while the defensive advantages given to line infantry against cavalry became irrelevant with the effective removal of offensive cavalry from the battlefield {{in the face of the}} improved weaponry.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss a {{methodology}} for monitoring failures and other activity in discrete event systems that are described by Petri nets.

We focus primarily on separate embeddings in which the functionality of the original Petri <b>net</b> is <b>retained</b> in its exact form.

40|$|Abstract. Wash {{resistance}} and field bioefficacy of PermaNet ® 2. 0 nets, long lasting insecticidal nets, against mosquitoes were evaluated in Assam, northeastern India. After repeated hand washings at 12 -day intervals {{a decline in}} the mosquito killing ability of PermaNet nets was noted (trend χ 2 38. 9, p < 0. 0001), yet these <b>nets</b> <b>retained</b> good insecticidal efficacy for up to 15 wash cycles, producing a 72. 5 % mean mortality of An. minimus 24 hours after a 3 -minute exposure in World Health Organization cones after 15 washings. Significantly fewer (p< 0. 001) mosquitoes were captured in self-baited landing collections in houses equipped with PermaNet nets than in houses using untreated nets in the case of culicines (p< 0. 001) but not with anophelines, including An. minimus. The use of PermaNet nets resulted in noticeably fewer bites from Culex pseudovishnui (68. 5 %) and Cx. quinquefasciatus (70 %). Blood-feeding inhibition of mos-quitoes in deliberately torn PermaNet nets was seen, indicating a protective effect for those sleeping under these nets. No serious adverse effects of the PermaNet nets were reported by users. scale coverage of the community with ITN...|$|R

40|$|The {{deployment}} {{dynamics of}} a tape-spring style, folding MAV wing in flight are complicated and an investigation is made using wind tunnel testing. High speed photography {{is used to}} characterize the deployment motion of the wing while a force balance records six- axis aerodynamic loading of the model. An in-flight deployment of a folding wing would be advantageous after an autonomous tube launch, however the dynamics are potentially problematic due to buckling. Steady state aerodynamics of prototype tube-launch MAVs are characterized for both rigid body and compliant, rolling wings. Aerodynamic phenomena associated with the significant relative body size are identified. Wing deployments are demonstrated at four different angles-of-attack at single velocity, while an extreme case deployment is shown at a high velocity. Two-piece cylindrical shells are used to retain the wing prior to deployment and are released by hot-wire cutting of <b>retaining</b> <b>lines.</b> Three phenomena leading improper deployment are noted. Aeroelastic flutter is observed and characterized after the wing deployment at certain conditions...|$|R

40|$|Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are {{the first}} line choice for malaria vector control in sub-Saharan Africa, with most {{countries}} adopting universal coverage campaigns. However, there is only limited information on LLIN durability under user conditions. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the durability of Olyset(®) LLINs distributed during campaigns between 2009 and 2011 in Tanzania. A retrospective field survey was conducted in eight districts in Tanzania mainland to assess the durability of Olyset campaign nets. Household questionnaires {{were used to assess}} attrition, i. e. net loss. All nets remaining in households were collected. A sub-sample of 198 Olyset campaign nets was examined for bio-efficacy against Anopheles gambiae s. s. mosquitoes, permethrin content and physical integrity following standard World Health Organization (WHO) methods. Of 6067 campaign nets reported to have been received between 2009 and 2011, 35 % (2145 nets) were no longer present. Most of those nets had been discarded (84 %) mainly because they were too torn (94 %). Of the 198 sub-sampled Olyset LLINs, 61 % were still in serviceable physical condition sufficient to provide personal protection while 39 % were in unserviceable physical condition according to WHO proportionate Hole Index (pHI). More than 96 % (116 / 120) of nets in serviceable condition passed WHO bioefficacy criteria while all nets in unserviceable condition passed WHO bioefficacy criteria. Overall mean permethrin content was 16. 5 g/kg (95 % CI 16. 2 - 16. 9) with 78 % of the sub-sampled <b>nets</b> <b>retaining</b> recommended permethrin content regardless of their age or physical condition. Nets aged 4 years and above had a mean permethrin content of 14 g/kg (95 % CI 12. 0 - 16. 0). The only statistically significant predictor of reduced physical net integrity was rats in the house. Two-to-four years after a mass campaign, only 39 % of distributed nets remain both present and in serviceable physical condition, a functional survival considerably below WHO assumptions of 50 % survival of a 'three-year' net. However, the majority of <b>nets</b> still <b>retained</b> substantial levels of permethrin and could still be bio-chemically useful against mosquitoes if their holes were repaired, adding evidence to the value of net care and repair campaigns...|$|R
