Chaptal's meaning was that nitrogen {{is the essential}} part of nitric acid, which in turn was produced from niter.

40|$|Background: After a trauma, {{the post}} {{aggression}} metabolism is linked {{with a loss}} of free glutamine in the plasma and a functional disorder (dysfunction) of different cell populations, such as immune- and intestinal cells. It is also related to an increased risk of infectious complications as well as the septic course of the disease. Methods: We took twenty patients, who were diagnosed with esophagus carcinoma, and had gone through the process of a distal resection of the esophagus followed by a procedure that relocated the stomach upwards where the missing esophagus part was. Beginning on the second day, ten of these twenty patients started taking parenterally 0, 1 g/kg KG/d of glycyl- glutamine and 0, 15 g/kg KG/d starting with day three through day eight post-operative. The other test group of ten patients was given parenterally a standardized, free of glutamine amino acid solution, but with the same amount of calories and <b>nitrogenes</b> as the first test group. We measured the glutamine levels in the plasma, the concentration of ICAM- 1 and e-selektin in the serum, the CD 62 L-, CD 11 b- and CD 64 -expression on monocytes and granulocytes. Furthermore, we measured the expression on phagocyte secretion and the oxidative burst on monocytes and granulocytes, the HLA-DR expression on monocytes, the concentration of IL- 4 and IL- 10 as well as CRP and PCT in the serum as well as the microbiological development of the wounded area, urine and the tracheal secretion. In addition, we were able to detect inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs with the help of radiological devices. Results: All of the tested areas do not show any {{significant differences between the two}} test groups. Summary: Earlier studies show that at least 11 - 15 g of glutamine per day or 0, 2 g/kg body weight/d is needed to be able to show clinically or immunologically measuarable results. Furthermore, possible measurable results for regulative and biochemical processes in the body can only be achieved with a latency time of 3 - 5 days. Based on literature, patients who have undergone a resection of the esophagus should be classified as surgical patients with a greater need for glutamine. Therefore, the insignificant results can be concluded due to the low concentration of glutamine in the parenteral diet as well as the point in time of the application...|$|R

Those permanent and stable gases are the necessary factors for the balance of continuity of living.

The three rotational diffusion constants cannot be determined solely by conventional spin-lattice relaxation measurements. In addition to conventional dipolar 13 C-spin-lattice relaxation rates the cross correlation rates between the dipolar and 'chemical-shift anisotropy' mechanism were measured. Both relaxation pathways contain all necessary information about the molecular dynamics. From these rates the rotational diffusion constants were calculated. The investigated temperature range for benzene lay between 280 K and 323 K and for pyridine between 278 K and 318 K. The benzene/polystyrene solution was investigated at 298 K. Thus the activation parameters of reorientation for the molecules in their neat liquids could be determined. For both substances the motion about the 'out of plane' axis is fastest. The reorientation about the two perpendicular 'in plane' axes for pyridine are different; the motion about the axis through the <b>nitrogene</b> atom being slowest. The high dipolar moment of pyridine is probably the cause for the overall slower motion compared to that of the unpolar benzene.

40|$|Prev'Air is the French {{operational}} system for air pollution forecasting. It is developed and maintained by INERIS with {{financial support from}} the French Ministry for Environment. On a daily basis it delivers forecasts up to three days ahead for ozone, <b>nitrogene</b> dioxide and particles over France and Europe. Maps of concentration peaks and daily averages are freely available to the general public. More accurate data can be provided to customers and modelers. Prev'Air forecasts {{are based on the}} Chemical Transport Model CHIMERE. French authorities rely more and more on this platform to alert the general public in case of high pollution events and to assess the efficiency of regulation measures when such events occur. For example the road speed limit may be reduced in given areas when the ozone level exceeds one regulatory threshold. These operational applications require INERIS to assess the quality of its forecasts and to sensitize end users about the confidence level. Indeed concentrations always remain an approximation of the true concentrations because of the high uncertainty on input data, such as meteorological fields and emissions, because of incomplete or inaccurate representation of physical processes, and because of efficiencies in numerical integration [1]. We would like to present in this communication the uncertainty analysis of the CHIMERE model led in the framework of an INERIS research project aiming, on the one hand, to assess the uncertainty of several deterministic models and, on the other hand, to propose relevant indicators describing air quality forecast and their uncertainty. There exist several methods to assess the uncertainty of one model. Under given assumptions the model may be differentiated into an adjoint model which directly provides the concentrations sensitivity to given parameters. But so far Monte Carlo methods seem to be the most widely and oftenly used [2, 3] as they are relatively easy to implement. In this framework one probability density function (PDF) is associated with an input parameter, according to its assumed uncertainty. Then the combined PDFs are propagated into the model, by means of several simulations with randomly perturbed input parameters. One may then obtain an approximation of the PDF of modeled concentrations, provided the Monte Carlo process has reasonably converged. The uncertainty analysis with CHIMERE has been led with a Monte Carlo method on the French domain and on two periods : 13 days during January 2009, with a focus on particles, and 28 days during August 2009, with a focus on ozone. The results show that for the summer period and 500 simulations, the time and space averaged standard deviation for ozone is 16 µg/m 3, to be compared with an averaged concentration of 89 µg/m 3. It is noteworthy that the space averaged standard deviation for ozone is relatively constant over time (the standard deviation of the timeseries itself is 1. 6 µg/m 3). The space variation of the ozone standard deviation seems to indicate that emissions have a significant impact, followed by western boundary conditions. Monte Carlo simulations are then post-processed by both ensemble [4] and Bayesian [5] methods in order to assess the quality of the uncertainty estimation. (1) Rao, K. S.

40|$|Acknowledging the {{increasingly}} prominent urban character of ecosystems globally, mangroves being no exception, and possible impediments to {{the viability of}} these ecosystems (i. e. the inherent capacity or ability to grow, develop or recover after disturbances), we adapt a system‟s approach to establish {{the viability of the}} peri-urban mangrove of Tudor creek in Mombasa, Kenya. Three important aspects of the peri-urban mangroves are assessed. These include (i) structural aspects (vegetation structure and regeneration), (ii) functional aspects (productivity) and (iii) human aspects (socioeconomics). Chapter 1 and 2 introduce the study, outlining the objectives and the study area. The chapters lay down an overview of the mangrove trees physiological adaptations and the ecological attributes that make the mangrove ecosystems unique and highly adaptable to a harsh and dynamic intertidal environment. The chapters further outline the extent and status of mangroves in Kenya, their socioeconomic importance, and the legislation that governs their management and conservation. Chapters 3 and 6 describe the structural attributes and regeneration status of the peri-urban mangroves of Tudor creek. Based on species importance values the dominant mangrove species were Rhizophora mucronata Lam. (Rhizophoraceae) and Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. (Acanthaceae) & 61607; Lumnitzera racemosa Willd. (Combretaceae), reported in an earlier floristic survey, was not encountered. Tree density varied between 1, 264 trees ha– 1 and 1, 301 trees ha– 1, which are within the range of values reported for similar forests globally. However, the size-class structure showed the numerical dominance of small trees over larger trees. The spatial distribution pattern of adults and juveniles varied greatly between sites had a close to uniform pattern (Morisita‟s Index Iδ > 1) for juveniles. This pattern of distribution is not expected for a healthy forest. The distribution of regenerating seedlings was mainly impacted by canopy gap sizes. These chapters shows that unmanaged but exploited peri-urban mangroves are structurally degraded, having enlarged canopy gaps, characterised by spatial and temporal heterogeneity in edaphic conditions that influences regeneration. This enlarged gaps and edaphic heterogeneity imposes longer periods for canopy closure by lowering regeneration and promoting mortality of seedlings. Larger gaps (> 60 m²) had lower regeneration levels and intermediate gaps (20 - 50 m²) had adequate regeneration. The occurrence of R. mucronata seedlings and saplings in the understorey under all cover types and inundation confers advantages to this species under the current disturbance regime. Disturbances include sewage pollution, unregulated harvesting and siltation. The current status of the forest is reminiscent of a recovery phase, a multiphase species succession stage, after a major disturbance event, accompanied by recurrent anthropogenic pressure. This study shows that species composition and thus recovery of a mangrove forest after disturbance depends in part on the balance between subsequent large-scale natural and recurrent small-scale human disturbances. Chapter 4 assesses the human dependence on the peri-urban mangrove. Through questionnaires and field surveys, the study demonstrates the challenges of questionnaire surveys targeting respondents involved in exploitation of sensitive resources. This potentially limits if not inhibit information flow. Firewood is the ubiquitous form of mangrove wood utilisation, exploited at both subsistence and commercial scales. Forest assessments indicate the lack of preferred or specific harvesting sites, with R. mucronata being the most harvested, probably due to its distribution range and ease of access. Sewage pollution was viewed with mixed feelings. Many appreciate the nutrient enrichment of the sewage rather than the filtration capacity of mangroves, resulting in the usage of sewage for irrigating small plots of subsistence farms. The study shows that resource exploitation is intense in an urban setting due to an economic drive and an increasing demand. In the rural setting on the other hand, utilisation included both subsistence and commercial charcoal production. This has promoted more efficient, destructive and unsustainable exploitation levels. Associated benefits of these activities grossly under-value the ecosystem goods and services in addition to degrading the ecosystem. Our observations, consistent with other studies, shows that management of mangroves for wood extraction in urban areas may not be a viable and/or sustainable option, as it conflicts with the essential „filtration‟ and „habitat provisioning‟ functions and services of mangrove ecosystems. These functions and services are increasingly important in a “diminishing” urban environment. This arises out of the lack of adequate alternatives and conflicting interests in growing urban areas. It is recommended that „adaptive‟ and „participatory management’ based on multiple uses and users, with specific legislative, education and institutional interventions. Integrating local ecological knowledge, may further expedite the formulation of sustainable management plans for peri-urban mangroves. Chapter 5 presents insights on the productivity of an under-valued, over-exploited and sewage polluted peri-urban mangrove through litter fall studies on three common mangrove species, R. mucronata, A. marina and S. alba. The study covers a period of two years. The mean annual litter fall was estimated at 12 ± 3 t ha- 1 yr- 1 for the whole stand, which is within the range of values reported for similar forests occupying the same latitudinal range. Litter fall, in both content and quantity was highly seasonal, with high rates occurring in the dry North Easterly Monsoon (NEM) season, January-April (ca. 5 ± 1 g DW m- 2 day- 1) and lower rates in the cool and wet South Easterly Monsoon (SEM) season, June-October (ca. 3 ± 0. 5 g DW m- 2 day- 1). R. mucronata recorded the highest annual rate of 15 ± 3 t ha- 1 yr- 1. No significant differences in litter fall rates were observed between A. marina and S. alba, (11 ± 3 and 10 ± 5 t ha- 1 yr- 1 respectively). Sewage exposure levels did not appear to influence litter production rates despite higher nutrient levels in completely exposed sites. δ 15 N varied with species; A. marina (6. 48 ± 0. 03 ‰) and S. alba (6. 76 ± 0. 24 ‰) having higher composition than R. mucronata (3. 88 ± 0. 64 ‰). The leaf C:N ratio strongly correlated with elevated leaf δ 15 N signature. Higher C:N ratio for R. mucronata corresponding with lower leaf δ 15 N (3. 88 ± 0. 64 ‰) signature, and lower C:N ratio for A. marina and S. alba (6. 48 ± 0. 03 ‰ and 6. 76 ± 0. 24 ‰ respectively) corresponding with higher δ 15 N signature. This reflects species specific response to raw sewage exposure. This implies the forest has a more open N cycle, favouring δ 15 N accumulation within the system. This study shows that sewage exposure does not necessarily translate into elevated productivity in mangroves, but may alter litter nitrate content depending on species, possibly altering the decay of litter and nutrient cycling. Chapter 7 presents a synthesis linking the findings to possible implications on the general status of the mangrove ecosystem. The major disturbances observed for the peri-urban mangroves of Tudor creek include (i) domestic sewage pollution, (ii) recurrent unregulated harvesting; and (iii) recurrent annual siltation during the rainy season. Our observations indicate that (i) Raw domestic sewage pollution may not be harmful to the mangrove vegetation, but may affect edaphic conditions through nutrients enrichment. Sewage pollution effects, though not qualitatively proven in our study, enhance growth of mangrove trees. This is due to increase in amounts of nutrients available for biomass formation, observed as leaf nitrates resorption efficiencies. However, the raw domestic sewage is reported to alter the general healthy decomposing aerobic-anaerobic mangrove system to a complete anaerobic system. This tends to lower efficiencies in nutrient cycling, and cause accumulation of nutrients in the sediments. Observations within the same site and other East African mangroves (under the PUMPSEA project) indicate negative effects of sewage on the sediment cyanobacterial diversity, with an increase in microalgal abundance. Furthermore, within Mikindani (a sewage impacted site in Tudor creek), high rates of sediment ΣCO 2 production indicate a system under stress due to the presence of easily degradable organic matter. (ii) Un-regulated harvesting creates and enlarges canopy gaps, lowering availability of seed bearing trees, altering species composition and stem size distribution due to its selective nature, and lowers regeneration under the enlarged canopy gaps. This strongly lowers recovery rates after major disturbances. (iii) Siltation stands out as a major cause of degradation. Siltation is extrinsic in nature, a result of poor land use practices. This probably makes it a major issue of concern due to its impact on regeneration. A major siltation event, associated with the 1997 - 1998 ENSO, is widely identified as a cause of enlarged canopy gaps. Little recovery has occurred 10 years after the event due to recurrent anthropogenic pressure. The combined effects of these factors have important implications on growth, productivity and recovery of the mangrove ecosystem. The effects include shifts or changes in mangrove tree species distribution. This has lowered the system functional diversity and response diversity, and therefore ecosystem resilience - viability of the ecosystem. It is recommended that integrated adaptive management, based on sound knowledge of the system is the recommended approach. The participation of stakeholders (government institutions, the private sector and local communities) is crucial for managing peri-urban mangroves for sustainability. Not intervening may only result in a worst case scenario. Especially with the current global financial crisis, more locals will turn to „cheap‟ mangrove firewood. En vue de l‟augmentation de l‟urbanisation dans les multiples écosystèmes du monde, les mangroves n'étant pas une exception, on observe des obstacles à la viabilité de ces écosystèmes, c. -à-d. leur capacité inhérente de se développer, de s‟étendre ou de récupérer après des perturbations sous des conditions urbaines. Nous avons adapté une approche systémique pour établir la viabilité des mangroves périurbaines de la baie de Tudor à Mombasa, Kenya. Trois aspects importants des mangroves périurbaines sont évalués. Cela inclus (i) les aspects structurels (structure de la végétation et la régénération), (ii) aspects fonctionnels (productivité) et (iii) aspects humains (socio-économiques). Les Chapitres 1 et 2 introduisent l'étude, en exposant brièvement les objectifs et le domaine d'étude. Les chapitres présentent un panorama des adaptations physiologiques des palétuviers et des attributs écologiques qui rendent l‟écosystème de la mangrove unique et hautement adaptable à un environnement intertidal rigoureux et dynamique. Les chapitres suivants exposent l‟étendue et le statut des mangroves au Kenya, leur importance socio-économique et la législation qui cadre leur gestion et conservation. Les chapitres 3 et 6 décrivent les caractéristiques structurelles et les étapes de la régénération des palétuviers périurbains de la baie de Tudor. Par ordre d'importance des espèces, les palétuviers les plus souvent rencontrés étaient Rhizophora mucronata (Rhizophoraceae) et Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. (Acanthaceae) & 61607; Lumnitzera racemosa Willd. (Combretaceae) n'a pas été rencontrée lors d‟un voyage floristique précédent. La densité d'arbre varie entre 1. 264 arbres ha- 1 et 1. 301 arbres ha- 1, ce qui correspond aux moyennes rapportées pour des forêts comparables dans le monde. Cependant, la structure des classes de taille montre une dominance numérique des palétuviers moins développés par rapport aux plus développés. Le pattern de distribution spatiale des adultes et des juvéniles varie considérablement entre les sites et montre presque un modèle uniforme (l'index de Morisita; Iδ > 1). Ce modèle de distribution n'était pas attendu pour une forêt non altérée. La distribution de la régénération des pousses est principalement dictée par la taille des gaps. Ce chapitre montre que les mangroves périurbaines, exploitées et non aménagées, sont structurellement dégradées, ayant des larges gaps caractérisés par une hétérogénéité des conditions édaphiques qui influencent la régénération. Quant aux gaps les plus larges, on retrouve un taux de régénération plus faible. Les gaps élargis et l‟hétérogénéité édaphique imposent de plus longues périodes de fermeture des canopées, en diminuant la régénération et promouvant la mortalité des pousses. Les gaps plus grands (> 60 m 2) ont des niveaux de régénération plus bas et les gaps intermédiaires (20 - 50 m 2) ont une régénération adéquate. L‟occurrence de pousses et de juvéniles de R. mucronata dominent le niveau inférieur de tous les types de couvertures végétales et d‟inondation. Cela confère un avantage à cette espèce sous le régime de perturbation actuel. Les perturbations incluent les eaux usées non traitées, les récoltes non-réglementées et l‟envasement. L'état actuel de la forêt est une phase de récupération, un stade de succession d‟espèces en multiples phases, suite à un événement majeur de perturbation, accompagné d‟une pression anthropogénique récurrente. Cette étude démontre que la composition d‟espèces et donc de la récupération de la forêt de mangrove après une perturbation dépend en partie de l'équilibre entre les perturbations naturelles à grande échelle et humaines à moindre échelle. Le chapitre 4 évalue la dépendance humaine à l'égard de la mangrove périurbaine. Par des questionnaires et des travaux de terrains, on a constaté que l‟utilisation des questionnaires est délicate. En effet, ceux-ci ciblent des personnes impliquées dans l'exploitation des ressources sensibles. Ceci limite potentiellement sinon empêche le flux de l'information. Le bois de feu est la forme d‟utilisation la plus répandue du bois de mangrove, utilisé dans le cadre de la subsistance et du commerce. Les résultats indiquent qu‟il n‟y a pas de sites de récolte préférés. R. mucronata est l‟espèce la plus récoltée, probablement en raison de sa distribution et facilité d‟accès. La pollution par les eaux usées a appréciation mixte. Certains l‟apprécient pour l‟irrigation de leurs cultures de subsistance, malgré la capacité de filtration des mangroves. L‟étude montre que l‟exploitation des ressources est intense, dans un cadre urbain, dû à une conduite économique et une demande croissante. Par contre, dans le cadre rural, l‟utilisation inclus la production de charbon de subsistance ainsi que commercial. La limitation des moyens de vie dans le cadre rural, couplés à la pauvreté et le besoin d‟énergie domestique bon marché, créent une dépendance des ressources de mangroves. Ceci a favorisé des niveaux d‟exploitation plus importants, destructeurs et non viables. Les gains associés à ces activités qui dégradent l‟écosystème, sont beaucoup moins importants que les biens et les services offerts par la mangrove. Nos observations, en accord avec d‟autres études, montrent que la gestion de l‟extraction du bois des mangroves dans des zones urbaines n‟est pas une option viable et/ou durable, puisqu‟il entre en conflit avec les fonctions et services essentiels de „filtration‟ et „d’approvisionnement pour l’habitation‟ de la mangrove. Ce phénomène résulte du manque d‟alternatives adéquates et des conflits d‟intérêts des zones urbaines en expansion. Il est recommandé de mettre en place une gestion „adaptative‟ et „participative‟ fondée sur les utilisations et utilisateurs multiples, ainsi qu‟une législation, une éducation et des interventions institutionnelles spécifiques, intégrant les connaissances écologiques locales, afin de faciliter des plans de gestion durable pour les mangroves périurbaines. Le chapitre 5 présente un aperçu de la productivité de la mangrove périurbaine sous-évaluée, surexploitée et polluée par des eaux usées à travers des études de la litière de trois espèces communes de palétuvier, R. mucronata, A. marina et S. alba. L‟étude couvre une période de deux ans. La chute moyenne annuelle de litière a été estimée à 12 ± 3 t ha- 1 an- 1 pour la totalité du secteur, ce qui correspond aux valeurs de forêts comparables occupant des latitudes similaires. La composition et la quantité de la litière changent fortement avec les saisons. Les taux élevés (ca. 5 ± 1 g DW m 2 j- 1) s‟observent au cours de la saison sèche (Janvier-Avril), sous le North Easterly Monsoon (NEM). Tandis que les taux inférieurs (ca. 3 ± 0, 50 g DW m 2 j- 1) s‟observent au cours de la saison humide (Juin-Octobre), sous le South Easterly Monsoon (SEM). Il y a des variations significatives entre les espèces. R. mucronata a enregistré le taux annuel le plus élevé 15 ± 3 t ha- 1 an- 1. Par contre, il n‟y a pas de différences significatives entre A. marina et S. alba, (11 ± 3 et 10 ± 5 t ha- 1 an- 1, respectivement). Le niveau de pollution par les eaux usées ne semble pas influencer les taux de production de litière en dépit de la concentration plus élevées des nutriments dans les zones complètement exposées. Le δ 15 N a varié entre les espèces, A. marina (6, 48 ± 0, 03 ‰) et S. alba (6, 76 ± 0, 24 ‰) ayant une composition plus élevée que R. mucronata (3, 88 ± 0, 64 ‰). Cela implique que la forêt a un cycle de l‟N plus ouvert, favorisant l'accumulation dans le système. Cette étude démontre que l'exposition aux eaux usées ne se traduit pas nécessairement en une productivité élevée des palétuviers, mais peut changer le contenu de <b>nitrogène</b> total des feuilles, probablement en changeant la décomposition de la litière et le cycle des nutriments. Le chapitre 7 présente une synthèse liant les résultats aux implications possibles sur le statut général de l'écosystème des mangroves. Les perturbations principales observées pour les mangroves périurbaines de la baie de Tudor incluent (i) la pollution par les eaux usées domestiques, (ii) la récolte récurrente irrégulière et (iii) l‟envasement annuel pendant la saison des pluies. Nos observations indiquent que: (i) la pollution par les eaux usées non traitées n‟est pas nocive pour les palétuviers, mais peut affecter les conditions édaphiques par l'enrichissement en éléments nutritifs. Les effets de la pollution des eaux usées, quoique non prouvés qualitativement dans notre étude, augmentent la croissance des palétuviers. Ce par une augmentation des quantités de nutriments disponibles pour la formation de biomasse, observée lors de l‟étude de l‟efficacité de résorption des nitrates par les feuilles. Cependant, on rapporte que les eaux usées domestiques non traitées changent le système de décomposition aérobique-anaérobique naturel des mangroves vers un système uniquement anaérobique. Ce qui diminue l‟efficacité du cycle nutritif et engendre l'accumulation des nutriments dans les sédiments. Les observations sur le même site et sur d‟autres mangroves de l‟Afrique de l‟Est (sous le projet PUMPSEA), indiquent des effets négatifs des eaux usées sur la diversité des cyanobactéries du sédiment et une augmentation de l'abondance des micro-algues. En outre, à Mikindani (site affecté par des eaux usées dans la baie de Tudor), les taux élevés de production de ΣCO 2 dans le sédiment indiquent un système sous pression (ou sous stress), suite à la présence de la matière organique facilement dégradable. (ii) L‟exploitation non réglementée va créer et agrandir des gaps. En fonction de la nature sélective de l‟exploitation, il y aura une diminution de la disponibilité des arbres produisant des propagules, un changement de la composition des espèces et de la distribution des tailles des arbres. De plus, elle réduit la régénération sous les larges gaps. Cela diminue fortement les taux de rétablissement après d‟importantes perturbations. (iii) L'envasement est la cause majeure de la dégradation. L'envasement est extrinsèque par nature, parce qu‟il découle de mauvaises pratiques d‟exploitation de la terre. Ce phénomène est probablement le point de concertation majeur, dû à son impact sur la régénération. Un événement d'envasement majeur, lié à l‟ENSO de 1997 - 1998, est identifié comme étant une cause d‟agrandissement des gaps. Peu de récupération s'est produite lors des dix années qui suivirent l'événement, suite à la pression anthropogène récurrente. Les effets combinés de ces facteurs ont des implications importantes sur la croissance, la productivité et la récupération de l'écosystème des mangroves. Les effets incluent des variations ou des changements de la distribution des espèces de palétuviers. Ceci a diminué la diversité fonctionnelle et la diversité des réponses du système et a donc diminué la résilience de l‟écosystème - la viabilité de l'écosystème. Il est recommandé qu‟une gestion adaptative intégrée, fondée sur la connaissance orale du système, soit la meilleure approche. La participation des décideurs (institutions gouvernementales, secteur privé et communautés locales) est cruciale pour la gestion des mangroves périurbaines. Dans l‟absence d‟intervention, seul le pire scénario peut être envisagé. En particulier avec la crise financière globale actuelle, la population locale se tournera encore plus vers le bois de feu „bon marché‟ de la mangrove.
