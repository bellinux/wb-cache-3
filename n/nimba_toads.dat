40|$|Amphibians, and anurans in particular, {{show the}} highest {{diversity}} of reproductive modes among tetrapods. Nevertheless, viviparity is scarce in anurans and its occurrence {{is even more}} often assumed rather than confirmed. Probably the best studied viviparous amphibian is the Nimba toad, Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis. During more than 40 years of research, the Nimba toad’s reproductive morphology, endocrine activity of the ovary {{as well as the}} pituitary gland, and to some extent the ecological impact (seasonality, humidity, food availability) on reproduction was examined. Due to the Nimba toad’s unique reproductive mode, summaries are usually included in reviews discussing amphibian reproduction and articles on reproductive biology often discuss the exceptional reproductive system of <b>Nimba</b> <b>toads.</b> However, to our knowledge a detailed synthesis, summarising all the different original studies on the toad’s reproduction, is so far missing. In this paper we review and summarise all available initial publications, which often have been published in French and/or are difficult to access. A short overview is given of the climatic and environmental conditions experienced by <b>Nimba</b> <b>toads</b> and the key findings supporting a “true” viviparous reproduction with matrotrophy (maternal provision of nutrition during the gestation) and pueriparity (birth of juveniles). Then foetal development (morphological, gonad and pituitary development), and the female (ovary, oviduct, pituitary and their endocrine interactions) and the male reproductive system (testes and pituitary) are reviewed. Finally, the reproductive cycle and its link to the Nimba mountains’ seasonality and ecological/ conservation implications are discussed...|$|E
50|$|The western <b>Nimba</b> <b>toad</b> or Mt. <b>Nimba</b> {{viviparous}} <b>toad</b> (Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis) is {{a species}} of toad from highlands in the Mount Nimba region of Côte d'Ivoire and Guinea. This Critically endangered species is threatened by habitat loss, and mining of iron ore and bauxite. This and the equally threatened N. liberiensis are the only frogs/toads that are viviparous; it is possible liberiensis should be included as a subspecies of N. occidentalis.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the distribution of}} the viviparous <b>Nimba</b> <b>toad</b> Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis throughout its potential range, the montane grasslands of the Monts Nimba massif, West Africa. Although predominantly part of a World Heritage Site, the Monts Nimba also comprise a mining enclave in the northwestern part of the mountain massif. The present study revealed that the <b>Nimba</b> <b>toad</b> seems to have its most viable populations within the mining enclave (Mont Sempéré) or directly adjacent to it (Grands Rochers). These 2 populations and a third, presumably isolated one (Mont Richard Molard), may be source populations, whereas other smaller populations are likely to be sinks. We generally recorded lower toad densities than in earlier studies and failed to confirm the toads’ presence in parts of their former known range. Some of these changes might be due to an increased frequency of fires in recent years, resulting in the loss of a thick layer of grass roots on the rocky underground. However, the most imminent threat to the toads’ survival at present is the proposed mining project in the core area of their range. It is thus imperative that the Critically Endangered status of the <b>Nimba</b> <b>toad</b> be retained for the present. However, a broader and more in-depth study of the population sizes, population genetics and the microhabitat needs is urgently needed...|$|R
50|$|Endemic {{amphibians}} {{include the}} Western <b>Nimba</b> <b>toad</b> (Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis), {{found only in}} the montane grasslands of the Nimba Range, and which is totally viviparous. The Guinea Screeching Frog (Arthroleptis crusculum) is a threatened species found in the Nimba Range, Mounts Béro, Tétini, and Foko, the Simandou Range (Mts. Tibe and Fon), Loma Mountains, and Tingi Hills in high-altitude grasslands and in gallery forests during the dry season. Ptychadena submascareniensis is another frog species that has been found only on Mt. Nimba and in the Loma Mountains.|$|R
5000|$|Isolated high-altitude {{grassland}} {{extends from}} 1200-1400 meters {{to the highest}} peaks. There is the most famous endemic vertebrates are the <b>Nimba</b> viviparous <b>toad</b> (Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis), and the Lamotte's roundleaf bat (Hipposideros lamottei), the latter recorded from only one mining site. Endemic plants include among others Asplenium schnellii, Osbeckia porteresii and Blaeria nimbana.|$|R
40|$|Anurans are {{renowned for}} a high {{diversity}} of reproductive modes, but less than 1 % of species exhibit internal fertilisation followed by viviparity. In the live bearing West African <b>Nimba</b> <b>toad</b> (Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis), females produce yolk-poor eggs and internally nourish their young after fertilisation. Birth of fully developed juveniles takes place after nine months. In the present study, we used genetic markers (eight microsatellite loci) to assign the paternity of litters of 12 females comprising on average 9. 7 juveniles. In nine out of twelve families (75 %) a single sire was sufficient; in three families (25 %) more than one sire was necessary to explain the observed genotypes in each family. These findings are backed up with field observations of male resource defence (underground cavities in which mating takes place) as well as coercive mating attempts, suggesting that the observed moderate level of multiple paternity in a species without distinct sperm storage organs is governed by a balance of female mate choice and male reproductive strategies...|$|R
