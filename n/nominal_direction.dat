If a train sees balise 1 before balise 2 then it passes over {{the group in}} the <b>nominal</b> <b>direction.</b> Consequently, some packets may be dropped by the application software of the receiver {{if they are not}} designated for the relevant direction. The ERTMS header block of 50 bits contains the ETCS version, the current number and total count of balises within a balise group (up to 8 balises), a flag whether it is a copy (up to 4 copies) that increases chances for the receiver to see the telegram of the balise in a group, a serial number flagging whether the message has changed lately, a 10-bit country identifier along with the 14-bit balise group identifier allowing for a unique ID of every balise group. The linking information informs about the distance to the next balise group (one linking packet per direction) and the required train reaction if the next balise group is missed (e.g. train stop). The movement authority packet defines a maximum speed that may be used for a given maximum distance and maximum time - setting the maximum speed to zero will force the train to stop. The gradient profile may have a variable length based on the contained pairs of section length (scalar and number in the metric system) and section gradient (uphill/downhill flag and a number in %). Similarly the international static speed profile is given in a variable count of section parts with each part denoting the section length (number in meters - the scale is only given once {{at the start of the}} packet for all sections), the maximum speed (number * 5 km/h - allowed numbers are 0-120 i.e. some spare values are left over) and a flag if the speed restriction applies to the front or rear end of the train (possibly allowing for a delay). The trailer packet only contains its packet id with no parameters where 255 equals the state of all bits set in the 8-bit packet id field (11111111).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} the problem of MIMO link {{capacity}} assessment. Unlike previous analysis model whose trans-fer function H is preassigned as circularly-symmetric complex-valued Gaussian random matrix, we consider a directional MIMO channel model in the presence of Ricean fading and phys-ical scattering. Spatial parameter of the model is first separated into directional mean and its associating standard deviation, the <b>nominal</b> <b>direction</b> and the angular spread, respectively. An upper bound on the ergodic capacity mean is then proposed by using such a separable parameterization. Shown as a deterministic function of Rice factor, <b>nominal</b> <b>direction,</b> and angular spread, the proposed upper bound provides, fortunately, an insight into Ricean fading and physical scattering. Since it does not require any eigenvalue decomposition, the bound computation is thus very simple. Numerical examples are conducted to demonstrate not only the bound tightness compared with sample mean capac-ity, but also relationships of the bound to various parameters. I...|$|E

We report {{the existence of}} a spatial foreshock boundary behind which ULF waves are present. We have found that the ULF wave boundary at Venus is sensitive to the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) direction like the terrestrial one and appears well defined for a cone angle larger than 30 o. In the Venusian foreshock, the inclination angle of the wave boundary with respect to the Sun-Venus direction increases with the IMF cone angle. We also found that for the IMF <b>nominal</b> <b>direction</b> (θ BX = 36 °) at Venus’ orbit, the value of this inclination angle is 70 o. Moreover, we have found that the inferred velocity of an ion traveling along the ULF boundary is in a qualitative agreement with a quasi-adiabatic reflection of a portion of the solar wind at the bow shock. For an IMF <b>nominal</b> <b>direction</b> at Venus, the inferred bulk speed of ions traveling along this boundary is 1. 07 V SW, sufficiently enough to overcome the solar wind convection.

Numerical simulation is conducted to demonstrate the estimation possibility of three important parameters in wireless communication, such as the <b>nominal</b> <b>direction,</b> the angular spread and the generalized Rice factor.

One aspect that has received relatively little attention is the channel modeling, where the traditional assumption of point sources is inappropriate in many scenarios. Here, we use a statistical channel model for an environment where the signal energy arrives at the array in clusters of rays, distributed around the nominal directions of the signal sources. It is shown that each cluster can be well approximated by two point sources when the spread angle is small. This observation is used to derive low-complexity solutions both in the design of a beamformer with good interference rejection capabilities as well as for a parameter estimation algorithm for estimation of both <b>nominal</b> <b>direction</b> of arrival and spread angle.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{estimating}} the <b>nominal</b> <b>direction</b> and its un-derlying angular spread is considered herein. As encoun-tered in spatially distributed source localization, the compu-tation of these directional parameters might {{be regarded as}} two consecutive tasks. In this paper, we propose an asymptotic maximum l ikelihood (AML) approach to successively esti-mate both of them. The first advantage of estimation {{in this way is}} that it requires only two successive 1 -dimensional searches rather than joint 2 -dimensional optimization as uti-lized in the asymptotic maximum l ikelihood (AML) esti-mator. Therefore, the decoupled estimation in this way pro-vides more numerical flexibility. Since it belongs to a large-sample approximation of the exact ML method, numerical simulation is conducted in order to validate its asymptotic efficiency producible with respect to Cramér-Rao bound. Although its non-asymptotic performance is inferior to that provided by the joint AML approach, it appeared that, in the region of large number of temporal snapshot, the proposed AML estimator for decoupled estimation {{is the same as the}} AML criterion which employed the joint 2 -dimensions. 1...|$|E
