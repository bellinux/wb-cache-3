50|$|QEMU can emulate <b>network</b> <b>cards</b> (of {{different}} models) {{which share}} the host system's connectivity by doing network address translation, effectively allowing the guest {{to use the}} same network as the host. The virtual <b>network</b> <b>cards</b> can also connect to <b>network</b> <b>cards</b> of other instances of QEMU or to local TAP interfaces. Network connectivity can also be achieved by bridging a TUN/TAP interface used by QEMU with a non-virtual Ethernet interface on the host OS using the host OS's bridging features.|$|R
25|$|PXE {{acceptance}} since v2.1 {{has been}} ubiquitous; {{today it is}} virtually impossible to find a <b>network</b> <b>card</b> without PXE firmware on it. The availability of inexpensive Gigabit Ethernet hardware (NICs, switches, routers, etc.) has made PXE the fastest method available for installing an operating system on a client when competing against the classic CD, DVD, and USB flash drive alternatives.|$|E
25|$|This option {{allows the}} {{operating}} system to boot on real hardware. The data is sent via a local area network (LAN) to the client machine. This requires two computers: one as the client machine (on which the OS is booted) and one as the server (usually the development machine). It also requires a network connecting the two computers, a client machine with a <b>network</b> <b>card,</b> and a Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) that can PXE boot. , debugging over a network is unsupported.|$|E
25|$|The {{link layer}} {{is used to}} move packets between the Internet layer {{interfaces}} of two different hosts on the same link. The processes of transmitting and receiving packets on a given link can be controlled both in the software device driver for the <b>network</b> <b>card,</b> {{as well as on}} firmware or specialized chipsets. These perform data link functions such as adding a packet header to prepare it for transmission, then actually transmit the frame over a physical medium. The TCP/IP model includes specifications of translating the network addressing methods used in the Internet Protocol to link layer addresses, such as Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. All other aspects below that level, however, are implicitly assumed to exist in the link layer, but are not explicitly defined.|$|E

25|$|A {{firmware}} rootkit uses device or platform firmware {{to create}} a persistent malware image in hardware, such as a router, <b>network</b> <b>card,</b> hard drive, or the system BIOS. The rootkit hides in firmware, because firmware is not usually inspected for code integrity. John Heasman demonstrated the viability of firmware rootkits in both ACPI firmware routines and in a PCI expansion card ROM. In October 2008, criminals tampered with European credit card-reading machines before they were installed. The devices intercepted and transmitted credit card details via a mobile phone network. In March 2009, researchers Alfredo Ortega and Anibal Sacco published details of a BIOS-level Windows rootkit that was able to survive disk replacement and operating system re-installation. A few months later they learned that some laptops are sold with a legitimate rootkit, known as Absolute CompuTrace or Absolute LoJack for Laptops, preinstalled in many BIOS images. This is an anti-theft technology system that researchers showed can be turned to malicious purposes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first major}} change was made as from 28 September 1997. [...] At this time, the name Network Railcard was adopted; the joint-holder option was removed; {{the price was}} {{increased}} to £20.00; and the First Class supplement facility was discontinued. [...] All other benefits remained the same, however. [...] New ticket stock was introduced with APTIS form number RSP 4599/188 (the <b>Network</b> <b>Card</b> was BR 4599/22 and, after privatisation, RSP 4599/22).|$|E
2500|$|As can be seen, {{discounts}} {{of various}} sizes were given until 1997 to holders of Young Persons and Senior Railcards who {{wanted to buy a}} <b>Network</b> <b>Card.</b> [...] Upon the relaunch under the [...] "Network Railcard" [...] name, this facility was withdrawn. [...] These discounted Network Cards were issued in bulk on British Rail's behalf at an agency in Slough, and carried an endorsement on the reverse to show which type of reduction applied.|$|E
2500|$|Adult tickets issued {{with the}} {{original}} <b>Network</b> <b>Card</b> displayed a status code of NSE, while child tickets showed CHNSE. [...] These codes continued in use when the Network Railcard was introduced in its place, until the major change in June 2002. [...] When the [...] "new" [...] Network Railcard was introduced, with the £10.00 minimum fare and altered child discount, there were still {{a large number of}} [...] "old" [...] Network Railcards in use, with no minimum fare restriction and £1.00 flat fares for children. [...] A method of distinguishing these on tickets had to be developed. [...] ATOC introduced the following codes accordingly, and uploaded them to all ticket issuing systems in mid-2002: ...|$|E

2500|$|Hyper-V, like Microsoft Virtual Server and Windows Virtual PC, saves each guest OS to {{a single}} virtual hard disk file. It {{supports}} the older [...]vhd format, {{as well as the}} newer [...]vhdx. Older [...]vhd files from Virtual Server 2005, Virtual PC 2004 and Virtual PC 2007 can be copied and used in Hyper-V, but any old virtual machine integration software (equivalents of Hyper-V Integration Services) must be removed from the virtual machine. After the migrated guest OS is configured and started using Hyper-V, the guest OS will detect changes to the (virtual) hardware. Installing [...] "Hyper-V Integration Services" [...] installs five services to improve performance, at the same time adding the new guest video and <b>network</b> <b>card</b> drivers.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{acquisition}} by Novell in 2003 {{and with the}} advent of openSUSE, this has been reversed: starting with version 9.2, an unsupported one-DVD ISO image of SUSE Professional was made available for download, as well as a bootable Live DVD evaluation. The FTP server continues to operate and has the advantage of [...] "streamlined" [...] installs, permitting the user to download only the packages the user feels they need. The ISO has the advantages of an easy install package, the ability to operate even if the user's <b>network</b> <b>card</b> does not work [...] "out of the box", and less experience needed (i.e., an inexperienced Linux user may not know whether or not to install a certain package, and the ISO offers several preselected sets of packages).|$|E
2500|$|When the <b>Network</b> <b>Card</b> was introduced, {{it quickly}} became popular with the public: more than 500,000 were sold per year at first, and a {{noticeable}} increase in use of the rail network at off-peak times for leisure purposes was achieved. [...] Although ownership had declined to around 360,000 {{by the time of}} the £10.00 minimum fare change in 2002, extra ticket sales totalling approximately £70 million were still generated per year. [...] (For comparison, total ticket sales across the whole British railway network, including peak, off-peak and other tickets, are approximately £3.5 billion.) [...] Ownership of railcards has stayed fairly stable since then; and with 360,000 sold at £20 each (£28 in 2011), sales of the railcards themselves bring in more than £7 million per year, before the additional revenue from journeys made with them is taken into account.|$|E

2500|$|The Network SouthEast brand was {{introduced}} to {{what had been the}} London & South East [...] on 10 June 1986. [...] The railcard was then introduced on 29 September 1986, under the name <b>Network</b> <b>Card.</b> [...] It offered a 34% discount on all off-peak fares for journeys wholly within the Network SouthEast area. [...] Tickets valid at peak times, such as Day Returns and Open Returns, were excluded, as were First Class tickets (however, a supplement ticket could be bought to upgrade a discounted Standard Class ticket to First Class at weekends). [...] On weekdays, journeys had to start after 10.00am, but there were no time restrictions at weekends or on Bank Holidays. [...] Up to three adults could accompany the railcard holder and gain the same discount, while up to four accompanying children could travel for a £1.00 flat fare. [...] This version of the railcard could be issued for either one person or two people. [...] On a two-person [...] "joint-holder" [...] ticket, either or both of the named holders could travel - that is, the card was transferable between the two.|$|E
