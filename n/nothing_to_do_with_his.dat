25|$|Noel Malcolm and Cees Leijenhorst {{deny the}} {{political}} {{background of the}} Hobbes-Boyle controversy. They argue that Hobbes’ rejection of the void has no political agenda and has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> attack on incorporeal substances, as Shapin and Schaffer claim.

After making a late appearance for Chelsea in their second game of the 2009–10 season, Ancelotti announced that Shevchenko would be likely to leave Chelsea before the summer transfer window closed. Despite this, Ancelotti said it had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> decision to leave Shevchenko out of Chelsea's 2009–10 Champions League squad, but just to continue playing first-team football.|$|E
25|$|Favre's agent, Bus Cook, {{later said}} that he also felt the Saints were {{deliberately}} trying to knock Favre out of the game, and claimed that several hits on Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner in the divisional round a week earlier crossed the line as well. It initially appeared that Cook's argument was strengthened {{by the fact that}} Warner was knocked out of that game with a chest injury (although he later returned), and retired two weeks later. However, Warner later said that the hit which knocked him out was legal, and had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> decision to retire.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} Pius IV was a {{reaction}} to the brutal rule of Paul IV and his nephews.

Although he had fathered three children before his consecration as pope, he kept them in obscurity and out of church governance, unlike pope Paul III and pope Alexander VI. His only cardinal-nephew was Charles Borromeo, a future saint – as for Paul IV's nephews, he showed no mercy, arresting Carlo and Alfonso in 1560 (Diomede had died just after the conclave), executing Carlo in 1561 and only pardoning Alfonso after he had spent over a year in prison.|$|E

25|$|According to the Mahaparinibbana Sutta of the Pali canon, {{at the age}} of 80, the Buddha {{announced}} that he would soon reach Parinirvana, or the final deathless state, and abandon his earthly body. After this, the Buddha ate his last meal, which he had received as an offering from a blacksmith named Cunda. Falling violently ill, Buddha instructed his attendant Ānanda to convince Cunda that the meal eaten at his place had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> passing and that his meal would be a source of the greatest merit as it provided the last meal for a Buddha. Mettanando and von Hinüber argue that the Buddha died of mesenteric infarction, a symptom of old age, rather than food poisoning.|$|E
25|$|After {{an urgency}} {{motion of the}} Bavarian SPD party in the Bavarian Parliament, the Minister of Justice Beate Merk (CSU party) defended herself {{in a speech in}} front of the Parliament on 15 December 2011 against the {{impression}} Mollath had been hospitalized due to his criminal complaint. The following day she was explaining through a spokesman, that the accommodation Mollaths in psychiatry was a consequence of his crimes and had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> wife or his lawsuit against the bank. She said, Mollath harmed his wife with strangulation marks on the neck, large hematoma and a bleeding bite wound. He also stabbed dozens of car tires, including those on vehicles of the wife's lawyers. His accommodation was confirmed by the Federal court and is observed regularly. She defended herself against the allegations that the state prosecution had failed to act because of instructions from leading politicians. Thereupon, the state prosecutor himself directed some questions towards the HypoVereinsbank.|$|E
25|$|Roddick {{was forced}} {{to pull out of}} the 2008 French Open due to a {{shoulder}} injury. After a visit to a doctor in New York, it was determined this was nothing more than an inflammation of the rotator cuff. His first tournament after the shoulder injury was the Artois Championship, his annual Wimbledon preparation, where he was the defending champion. Roddick defeated Mardy Fish and Andy Murray, before losing to eventual champion Rafael Nadal in the semifinals. At Wimbledon, Roddick was beaten by Serbia's Janko Tipsarević. This was his earliest exit at Wimbledon. Roddick was beaten at the Rogers Cup in the third round by Marin Čilić. He was then forced {{to pull out of the}} Cincinnati Masters following a neck injury, which he said may have been caused by a poor sleeping posture. He stated in an interview that the neck injury had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> shoulder injury. Roddick did not participate in the 2008 Summer Olympics, but chose to concentrate on the 2008 US Open. Roddick then played in the smaller hard-court tournaments in the US Open Series, including those at Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. At the Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles, Roddick lost to Juan Martín del Potro in the final.|$|E

25|$|Probably no {{instrument}} in modern time so {{lends itself to}} threats to constitutional guarantees of individual freedom as the polygraph or so-called lie detector. The threat of its use or the intimidation inherent in its use restricts free expression and communication of ideas, intrudes on an individual's subconscious thought, makes him fear to speak his thoughts freely, or compels him to speak against his will. To my mind, the entire purpose of these machines is to invade a man's mind and find what lurks in the innermost part of his mental consciousness for reasons which have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> ability to perform a job. If the right of privacy means anything at all {{and if it is}} a right to be cherished in our society, it means that people should be entitled to have thoughts, hopes, desires, and dreams that are beyond the reach of a bureaucrat, an employer, or an electronic technician. This is something which enthusiasts for these machines do not seem to understand. They do not understand and they do not appreciate how important privacy is to each American, and as long as that lesson is not understood, we all will find our right to privacy constricted if not abrogated entirely. I propose this legislation to ban the use of the polygraph for employment purposes in the hopes that Congress will pause for a moment, step back, and take a long look at the issues involved in the unrestrained use of the polygraph. Legislation is necessary to bring some order and control to the practice...|$|E

At the time, Obito could only use his right eye for close range while partially transporting himself between spaces to appear [...] "intangible" [...] for minutes. Through Obito's left eye, Kakashi can create a long-ranged portal that is primarily based on line-of-sight and can increase in size. As a result, Obito and Kakashi are unable to use Kamui against each other as the attacks cancel each other. Once Obito regained his left eye, his abilities increase {{to the point where}} he can use his eyes to create two distortions and then connect them to produce a wormhole from one location to another. However, as this ability has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> pocket dimension, it places a significant strain on Obito.|$|E

So he 'left' the band and we were looking for someone who would fit." [...] He told Mark Lewisohn, similarly, that when George Martin suggested [...] "changing their drummer" [...] the Beatles responded: [...] "Well, we're quite happy with him, he works great in the clubs," [...] but also that [...] "Pete had never quite been like the rest of us. We were the wacky trio and Pete was perhaps a little more sensible; he was slightly different from us, he wasn't quite as artsy as we were." ...|$|E

500|$|The Human Centipede {{contains}} {{relatively few}} gory images; {{little of the}} surgical procedure is depicted directly, no excrement is shown on screen, and according to Kim Newman in Empire, it is [...] "never quite as outrageous as it threatens to be." [...] Six stated that he wanted the film to be as authentic as possible and claimed to have consulted a Dutch surgeon during the creation and filming process, resulting in the film being [...] "100% medically accurate." [...] Six said that the surgeon initially wanted <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> film, as he felt Six was [...] "crazy" [...] and the idea had [...] "nothing to do with medical science." [...] However, the surgeon {{changed his mind and}} decided that he in fact liked the idea, and so came up with a method of creating a human centipede. Six has claimed that the central and rear members of the centipede could survive for years by supplementing their diet with an IV drip. The special effects team was led by a father and son team, Rob Hillenbrink and son Erik. They designed the final composition of the centipede from sketches provided by the consulting surgeon. The actors who made up the centipede wore hardened underwear, compared by Yennie to shorts, which had a rubber grip for the actors to wear for the actor behind on which to bite, creating the illusion of the mouth-to-anus connection. Six kept secret how the centipede would be formed as long as possible, and Yennie claimed that even her make-up artist did not know, asking Yennie what kind of [...] "suit" [...] the actors would be wearing.|$|E
