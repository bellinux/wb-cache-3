5000|$|A notable {{source of}} modern {{conspiracy}} theories involving the Jesuits is Vatican Assassins by Eric Jon Phelps. It {{is said to}} allege <b>Newt</b> <b>Gingrich</b> <b>is</b> [...] "one of the ten most dangerous, Jesuitical politicians of the Pope’s ‘Holy Roman’ Fourteenth Amendment, Cartel-Corporate-Fascist, Socialist-Communist American Empire" [...] and that the Jesuits {{played a role in}} the Assassination of John F. Kennedy. Skeptic Bob Blaskiewicz also claims that Phelps told him the alleged [...] "Grey aliens" [...] are not aliens but creations of Jesuit science.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the show}} begins, Hillary Rodham Clinton {{introduces}} {{herself and her}} husband, William Jefferson [...] "Bill" [...] Clinton. She reveals that Bill is actually two personalities, WJ and Billy, and {{that she is the}} only person who can see both of them. ("Overture"). With help from Hillary, WJ and Billy win the 1992 presidential election ("Awful-Awesome"). After arriving at the White House, WJ states his plans to be a serious and successful president, Hillary states her plan to be loved by the American people, and Billy states his plan to [...] "get some tail" [...] ("The Me I See"). In order to remain focused on his job, WJ starts ignoring Billy's fun-loving urges. Just a few days after being inaugurated, the media starts reporting on the Whitewater scandal, despite the fact that nobody who is reporting has any idea what the scandal actually is, and are just stretching the story out to gain viewers ("The Day After That"). Kenneth Starr is hired to investigate the scandal. Starr announces to the audience that he doesn't actually care about the American people or the Whitewater scandal, he's just in it for the fame ("A Starr is Born"). Hillary becomes increasingly worried that Billy will use his new office to cheat on her. As WJ reassures Hillary that he'll control Billy, Billy seduces White House intern Monica Lewinsky in the Oval Office ("Lie to You"). In order to comfort Hillary, WJ tells her that she can write the country's new healthcare plan. Republican <b>Newt</b> <b>Gingrich</b> <b>is</b> infuriated by this, and he works with Ken Starr to rally other Republicans and take control of the Congress majority ("Say Nay"). During an encounter with Billy in the Oval Office, Monica Lewinsky exclaims that she can't believe she's having an affair with the president ("Monica's Song"). WJ finds out about this and confronts Billy, starting an argument between the two. Hillary finds out about their fight and explains to them that [...] "the public likes it better when politicians work together" [...] ("Both Ways"). After settling his differences with Billy, WJ confronts Newt Gingrich and convinces him to pass Hillary's healthcare bill. WJ and Billy are reelected in the presidential election of 1996, but Billy {{is the only one that}} takes the oath of office, which means Billy is able to start ignoring WJ as payback for the beginning of their first term ("Both Ways (Reprise)").|$|E

40|$|In the West, {{multi-culturalism}} {{has come}} to mean better representation of minorities {{in public and private}} sector positions of authority and equal opportunity in hiring practices. "Tolerance " for other racial, linguistic, and national groups has been the catch-phrase in the swing toward multi-culturalism, in the search for a rainbow culture. But among others, Speaker of the House of Representative of the USA, <b>Newt</b> <b>Gingrich</b> <b>is</b> suspicious. He has argued that multi-culturalism will destroy the idea of the American nation, indeed any nation. Multi-culturalism, particularly, multi-cultural education, is evil. While it is easy to dismiss Gingrich as merely representing a type of fascism, in fact, multi-culturalism does threaten the nation-state. Bounded by the ideals of liberalism [...] individuality, one version of God, {{in the context of an}} efficient marketplace [...] the nation-state, if it were to yield to the demands of other cultures and civilizations, would find its very cultural existence threatened. It, the nation-state, would either (continue to) undergo a violent Balkanization or it could transcend its own limitations and become multi-civilizational and global. In a sense, Gingrich is thus right. Multi-culturalism is evil but only in the context of exclusive collective representations such as the nation-state...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{outcome of}} the 1998 congressional {{elections}} was {{an exception to the}} rule that the president’s party loses seats in midterm House elections. This article reviews and draws together theoretically the distinctive characteristics of the political context in 1998 and assesses the effects of the public’s evaluations of Bill Clinton (as president and as a person) and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. The findings suggest that voters ’ views of Bill Clinton as president exerted a sizable effect on the elections. A substantial influence of public opinion toward <b>Newt</b> <b>Gingrich</b> <b>is</b> also revealed. The estimated effects of voters ’ opinions of Bill Clinton as a person were much smaller. Two estimates of the combined effects indicate that if public opinion toward Clinton and Gingrich had been evenly balanced, the Democratic party would have lost seats in the 1998 House elections as the president’s party tradi-tionally has. In addition to providing insight into the 1998 elections, the findings answer broader questions about congressional elections. They also bear on important questions regarding {{the extent to which the}} determinants of political judgments are subject to influence (“prim-ing”) by the political environment. Our intention is to brand every single Democrat in the state with the scarlet “C. ” [...] . We will gratuitously use Clinton’s face on all our literature. (Trey Walker, exec-utive director of the South Carolina State Republican Party, August 1998, quoted in Foerstel 1998 a, p. 2281) It would have been much less of a political problem if he [Clinton] had told the truth [about Monica Lewinsky] at the beginning [...] There was a feeling we were approach...|$|E

50|$|PAL's {{controversial}} role {{influencing the}} school district's Sexual Orientation Curriculum Policy {{caught the attention}} of civil rights groups as well as the national media, in part because its influence occurred within the 2012 presidential contender Michele Bachmann's home district and because the Parents Action League is a local affiliate of the Minnesota Family Council, one of Michele Bachmann's largest supporters in the district.

5000|$|The primary {{has become}} one of several key early state nominating {{contests}} in the process of choosing the nominee of the Republican Party for the election for President of the United States. It has historically been more important for the Republican Party than for the Democratic Party; from its inception in 1980, until the nomination of Mitt Romney in 2012, the winner of the Republican presidential primary had gone on to win the nomination. As of 2012, the primary has cemented its place as the [...] "First in the South" [...] primary for both parties. <b>Newt</b> <b>Gingrich</b> <b>was</b> declared the winner of the race as soon as polls closed, however, Mitt Romney {{went on to win the}} nomination.|$|R

5000|$|The term is {{sometimes}} {{used in a}} pejorative sense by members of one party to attack members of their party who are either centrist or who have what they perceive to be the wrong ideology. The term Republicrat is commonly used by liberal Democrats to attack conservative and centrist members of the party, such as Senator Joe Lieberman. On the Republican side, George W. Bush, Mitt Romney, and <b>Newt</b> <b>Gingrich</b> <b>are</b> common examples of Republicrats due to their liberal stances on various political issues. Another term used by liberal Democrats to describe conservative and centrist members of their party is [...] "Democrat In Name Only" [...] or [...] "DINO"; likewise, a conservative Republican term for liberal and centrist Republicans is [...] "Republican In Name Only" [...] or [...] "RINO".|$|R

2500|$|<b>Newt</b> <b>Gingrich</b> <b>was</b> {{attacked}} {{by all the}} other candidates, squaring off in particular with Mitt Romney.

I know how the economy works." [...] Gingrich replied, [...] "Let's be candid. The only reason you didn't become a career politician is you lost to Teddy Kennedy in 1994", which drew boos and laughter from the audience. Romney replied [...] "If I'd have beaten Ted Kennedy I could have been a career politician, that's probably true.

And actually... you can tell which are which. The people who are decent, responsible citizens pick up after themselves.
