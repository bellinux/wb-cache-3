25|$|On August 1, 1828, {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Barney Griffin, who had {{travelled}} from Syracuse to the Village of Sackets Harbor several days earlier, ended up dying in the Jefferson County Poor House. Orville went over to investigate. Upon searching Griffin's clothes, he found the cash sum of two hundred and twenty-two dollars and fifteen cents - more than enough money for Griffin to pay for a hotel. Hungerford put an advertisement in the a paper to see if a relative would claim the money. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>did.</b> He then turned the money over to the County Treasurer for use of the Poor House, deducting a dollar for the advertisement money that came out of his own pocket. Understanding the nature of greed, he asked the County Board of Supervisors to indemnify him for his actions, which it agreed to do.|$|E

She cited the nearly impossible haste with which Kaycee had been interred, noting that even if Kaycee had not been autopsied – which was dependent upon the manner of her death and whether there was a doctor attending – the two days that Debbie claimed that gathering of mourners, memorial service, and cremation had been accomplished in was unlikely; [...] Mitchell also noted a number of inconsistencies in the backstory about Kaycee's cancer. Mitchell, working off Kaycee's [...] "internet address", traced the girl's location to Peabody, Kansas.

500|$|Munro {{moved from}} Mississauga to Toronto after high school, to attend OCAD University. From {{early on in}} his career, his {{signature}} medium was pastiche work with men's underwear. The origins of this work date back to his Intro to Sculpture class at OCAD, where his professor asked the students to [...] "bring a special object to class that isn't really functional, but is special to you." [...] Munro had long had an affinity for special underwear, ever since his mother had refused to buy him Underoos superhero underwear {{when he was a}} child; regarding white briefs, he said, [...] "They were clinical and sterile. They weren't very sexy. It just felt very repressed. I wanted Underoos so bad." [...] For the sculpture class, Munro decided to bring in a pair of underwear that he had stolen from a high school friend on whom he had a crush. He put the grey underwear on display in a Plexiglass cage, complete with air holes. In his subsequent work he decided to use white briefs as a medium [...] "because they were so accessible." [...] The summer after his sculpture class, to keep himself busy on a road trip, he made a quilt out of white underwear. In 1997, his first show involving underwear was held in a gallery supported by his college. The show received publicity after conservative columnist Michael Coren, in the Toronto Sun and on the radio, criticized Munro and his show, in particular for having said that it involved [...] "boys' underwear" [...] (although Munro had simply meant guys' underwear). Coren asked the public to bring dirty diapers to the exhibit, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>did.</b> Munro went on to have many showings of his underwear art, mostly [...] "rescued" [...] from second-hand Goodwill clothing outlets, including at Who's Emma, HEADspace, and Paul Petro Contemporary Art. Actor Selma Blair bought one of Munro's underwear works when she was in town for the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival.|$|E

2500|$|From 1991 to 1993, O'Brien was {{a writer}} and {{producer}} for The Simpsons. When O'Brien first arrived at the Fox lot, they temporarily gave him writer Jeff Martin's office. O'Brien was nervous and self-conscious, feeling that he would embarrass {{himself in front of}} what he regarded as an intimidating collection of writers. O'Brien would pitch characters in their voices as he thought that was the norm until Reiss informed him that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>did</b> such. He fit in quickly, commanding control of the room frequently; Josh Weinstein called it a [...] "ten-hour Conan show, nonstop". According to John Ortved, one of his fellow writers ventured that if Conan hadn't left to do Late Night, he was a shoo-in to take over as showrunner on The Simpsons.|$|E
2500|$|Like most commentators, Clausen ignores {{what the}} [...] "war warnings" [...] (and their context) {{explicitly}} warn, though indistinctly, against. Washington, with more complete intelligence than any field command, expected an attack anywhere {{on a list}} of possible locations (Pearl Harbor not among them), and since the Japanese were already committed to Thailand, it seems to have been expected another major operation by them was impossible. Clausen, like most, also ignores what actions Kimmel, Short, and Admiral Claude C. Bloch (Commander, Fourteenth Naval District, responsible for naval facilities in Hawaii) actually took. They took precautions against sabotage, widely expected as a precursor to war, and reported their preparations. The Hawaii commanders did not anticipate an air attack; <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>did</b> so explicitly. Indeed, the prevailing view at the time was Japan could not execute two major naval operations at once, so with the Thailand invasion convoy known to be at sea, the Hawaii commanders had good reason to feel safe.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a speech}} on June 25, 2003, criticizing giving Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair a Congressional Gold Medal of Honor, Paul said, [...] "These medals {{generally}} have been proposed to recognize a life of service and leadership, and not for political reasons—as evidenced by the overwhelming bipartisan support for awarding President Reagan, a Republican, a gold medal. These awards normally go to deserving individuals, which is why I have many times offered to contribute $100 of my own money, to be matched by other members, to finance these medals." [...] Texas Monthly awarded him the [...] "Bum Steer" [...] award for voting against a congressional honor for cartoonist Charles Schulz, but also noted, [...] "When he was criticized for voting against the [...] medal, he chided his colleagues by challenging them to personally contribute $100 to mint the medal. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>did.</b> At the time, Paul observed, 'It's easier to be generous with other people's money.

2500|$|The series' {{stunt man}} and stunt {{arranger}} Ray Austin expressed {{the opinion that}} the show's violence ultimately harmed its popular success in the United States. There The Avengers was given a late timeslot due to its violence. [...] "They did that with the first Avengers here , with Diana Rigg. They put us on at 11:30 pm on CBS , {{because it was too}} violent." [...] Austin goes on to explain that U.S. television follows a [...] "different code". Austin said that on The Avengers [...] "we were determined to do the show our way, the English way, and no one was going to stop us! And, indeed, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>did</b> stop us. We never, never got to prime time. And it was our own faults, because we would not comply to the Midwest. That's where the money comes from in this country, nowhere else. Forget Los Angeles, forget New York—you have to aim for the Midwest. If the Midwest watches your show, you've made it." [...] In fact the first and second series of Emma Peel episodes mainly aired at 10:00 pm on ABC. The final Rigg episodes and all the Linda Thorson episodes mainly ran at 7:30 pm, also on ABC.|$|E

That recognition was like when the Roman Emperor Caligula appointed his horse as a Senator: they recognized a state that never existed before. The Serbs there said, 'We want to stay within Yugoslavia. We don't want to be second-class citizens.' And then the conflicts were started by Muslims, no doubt. And the Serbs, in defending themselves, were always better fighters, no doubt. And they achieved results, no doubt. But please, we were insisting on peace. The international community gave premature recognition first of Slovenia and then of Croatia and supported the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina on a totally irregular basis." [...] A telephone conversation between Milošević and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzić in September 1991 talking about the prospects of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina was tapped by Yugoslav intelligence, which reported the transcript to Yugoslav prime minister Ante Marković, who released the transcript to the public to discredit Milošević. The transcript involved Milošević ordering Karadzic to [...] "Go to Uzelac , he'll tell you everything.

The policeman tells Poirot that his theory that only Sir Roger's prints would {{be found on the}} dagger handle proved correct and that Ralph is being sought by the police. Flora and Blunt arrive and, under Poirot's insistent questioning, Flora confesses that she never saw her uncle in the study as she claimed and that she stole the missing one hundred pounds, desperate for money.
