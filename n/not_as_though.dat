500|$|In August 1992, {{the group}} self-funded a seventrack self-titled {{extended}} play, {{also known as}} the Blue EP, on their own Finger label and distributed by MDS. It was produced by Leroy Bath and Ian Taylor, and recorded at Broken Toys Studios, Brisbane. The EP has an early version of [...] "Save Your Skin", co-written by Coghill, Collins, Haug, Middleton and Fanning; it was later expanded and released in July 1994 as a single from their debut album, Parables for Wooden Ears. Their second EP, Transfusion, was issued in September 1993, distributed by Polydor Records. At that time, Simon McKenzie of Time Off noted they were [...] "hoping the major label will put a bit of weight behind the disc, but it's <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they've signed a record deal or anything". McKenzie felt the EP showed they were [...] "wanting to get heavier and louder for a long time, but is it also a reaction against the sixties tags they've been stuck with?". The five tracks include [...] "Reap What You Sow", which reached the No.1 spot on the ARIA Alternative Singles Chart, replacing Nirvana's [...] "Heart-Shaped Box". The group recorded their first music video, for [...] "Reap What You Sow"; it was directed by David Barker, who subsequently directed their next seven videos. After the EP's success the group were signed by Polydor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reader is}} warned that [...] "The Scriptures calls {{things that are}} <b>not,</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they were; and sets that first which should be last, and last which should be first; to the end that Reason should never find out the meaning of God in the Scriptures." ...|$|E
2500|$|Film critic Scott Mendelson, {{writing in}} The Huffington Post, cited Scully {{as an example}} of strong female {{characters}} on television, calling her [...] "one of the most iconic characters in the science-fiction genre". Radio Times Laura Pledger also named her as a strong TV woman, placing her at #1. Rebecca Traister of Salon.com opined that Scully had a better character arc than Mulder. She wrote, [...] "The very fact that her character was such a hard sell made her repeated brushes with the supernatural all the more powerful. Mulder's desire to believe was so expansive, his credulity so flexible, that it's <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he was ever going to have either shaken from him. But Scully's surety was solid, stable, rigid; every time she saw something she thought she'd never see, we saw it crack, sparks fly from it. She was forced to question herself, grow, change". She praised her for being more [...] "rational, resilient, [...] mature" [...] than her partner and for their mature relationship. In a review of [...] "Irresistible", Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that it was a clich√© to put Scully in danger, as [...] "Scully is [...] heart, and any time she's in danger, it feels like the show itself is about to be stabbed through the heart".|$|E

2500|$|Then {{the elders}} of the {{congregation}} said, [...] "What shall we do for wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?" [...] And they said, [...] "There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe may not be destroyed from Israel. However, we cannot give them wives from our daughters, {{for the children of}} Israel have sworn an oath, saying, 'Cursed be the one who gives a wife to Benjamin.'" [...] Then they said, [...] "In fact, there is a yearly feast of the Lord in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, {{on the east side of}} the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah." [...] Therefore, they instructed the children of Benjamin, saying, [...] "Go, lie in wait in the vineyards, and watch; and just when the daughters of Shiloh come out to perform their dances, then come out from the vineyards, and every man catch a wife for himself from the daughters of Shiloh; then go to the land of Benjamin. Then it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to us to complain, that we will say to them, 'Be kind to them for our sakes, because we did not take a wife for any of them in the war; for it is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> you have given the women to them at this time, making yourselves guilty of your oath.'" [...] And the children of Benjamin did so (on Tu B'Av); they took enough wives for their number from those who danced, whom they caught. Then they went and returned to their inheritance, and they rebuilt the cities and dwelt in them. So the children of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family; they went out from there, every man to his inheritance.|$|E

50|$|Some {{physicians}} do <b>not</b> feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> obesity medicine {{should be}} its own sub-specialty.

6000|$|... "Wally, if you please, Jill. It's <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> we were strangers. I haven't my book of {{etiquette}} with me, but I fancy {{that about}} eleven gallons {{of cold water}} down the neck constitutes an introduction. What {{were you going to}} say?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That I cannot tell. Perhaps if I {{did know}} I should not tell. But it is so. You called at Queen's Gate, and I {{know that you}} were not admitted, though I was at home.

6000|$|... "He {{laughed a}} little; {{you know how}} he laughs, <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he were amused, but as though you were a damned fool, and said he'd go at once.

6000|$|... "Our {{terms are}} the Food. It is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> little and great could live {{together}} in any perfection of compromise. It is one thing or the other.

50|$|When she was young, Campos relates {{that during}} a trip to the National Cuban Museum of Fine Art, she {{distinctly}} felt that black Cubans were conspicuously missing from the art. She did <b>not</b> feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> black Cubans were equally represented.|$|R
60|$|All this, {{down to the}} {{smallest}} detail, was told to Hester,--Hester Bolton or Hester Caldigate, whichever she might be. And there was no word uttered by the man she claimed as her husband which she did <b>not</b> believe <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it were gospel.|$|R
60|$|He did <b>not</b> look <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{he shared}} her regret. He was {{standing}} {{on the other side of}} the dead man, with his arms folded and his eyes fixed steadily upon the cold white face. He seemed to have forgotten her presence.|$|R
