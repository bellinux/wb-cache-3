5000|$|In the Oxford Handbook of Transnational Feminist Movements, Valentine Moghadam {{says that}} [...] "women have worked {{together}} across borders {{since at least the}} mid-1800s. (55)" [...] What is now called first wave feminism started {{in the early twentieth century}} in the West with a focus on women’s suffrage. During World War II, the United States government gave women jobs because the war had caused a national shortage of labor. After the war ended, Irene Tinker says (oxford transnational), these jobs were taken away but women were <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> satisfied <b>going</b> back <b>to</b> their previous gender roles. Starting in the 1960s in the United States, second wave feminism emerged, defined by women’s organization around [...] "equal right to education, employment, and equal pay for equal work, and on sexual and reproductive rights." [...] The UN Decade for Women of 1976-1985, and the following four UN conferences on women between 1975 and 1995 were essential in creating transnational feminist networks and putting feminism on a global agenda. However starting in the 1980s there was a separation between Western feminists and Third World feminists. This occurred largely because Western feminists largely subscribed to liberal feminist perspectives, which focused on the common patriarchal oppressor of women, defined by its confining women to the household and traditional work. Liberal feminists propose that women break this oppression by leaving their traditional roles in the household, becoming educated, and entering the labor force. Women in the global South often felt that Western feminism did not represent them and align with their struggles. They felt that Western feminism was ethnocentric and assumed all women had similar situations. Scholars like Chandra Talpade Mohanty played and play an integral role in articulating concerns about Western feminism’s failure to account for non-Western subjects. Upon realizing that the common phenomena of capitalist globalization was causing women all over the world to be disproportioantely affected (CITE), transnational feminist movements allied together and helped to consolidate the field of transnational feminism. ¬¬ ...|$|R
