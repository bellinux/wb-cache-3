50|$|Golm {{transmitter}} was {{a medium}} wave broadcasting facility {{on the area}} of a former Reichsarbeitsdienst officer candidate school at Kuhforter Damm in Golm near Potsdam. It entered service in 1948 as the central broadcast transmitter for Brandenburg state. Until 1979 it used a wooden lattice tower of 98 m height with a horizontal wooden cross on its top as its antenna support. The ends of the beams of this cross were connected with wires. From the centre {{of each of these}} horizontal wires, a vertical wire was run down to the antenna tuner which was located in a building under the feet of the tower construction. The antenna of Golm transmitter consisted therefore of 4 T-antennas connected in parallel, forming an omnidirectional antenna with a <b>natural</b> <b>wavelength</b> of 528 m. The transmitter was built from second-hand parts obtained by dismantling a site in Reichenbach, Upper Lusatia. Test transmissions were undertaken on 16 April 1948, and from 1 May 1948 the facility operated on 564 kHz.|$|E
40|$|We study a {{membrane}} {{tube with}} unidirectional ion pumps driving an osmotic pressure difference. A pressure driven peristaltic instability is identified, quantitatively distinct from similar tension- driven Rayleigh type instabilities on membrane tubes. We discuss how this instability could {{be related to}} the function and biogenesis of membrane bound organelles, in particular the contractile vacuole complex. The unusually long <b>natural</b> <b>wavelength</b> of this instability is in close agreement with that observed in cells. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{adapt the}} "reverse taper" scheme {{presented}} by Saldin et al. (Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams, 9, 050702 [2006]) for attosecond pulse production to the XUV/soft-xray regime. We find that that GW-level pulses {{of a few}} femtosecond duration or shorter can be produced using electron beams of quite moderate parameters and undulators of 20 -m length or shorter. The output pulse is significantly shifted in wavelength relative to the main background which permits a further increase in contrast ratio via simple monochromatization. Moreover, the output pulse has a <b>natural</b> <b>wavelength</b> chirp that allows further temporal compression, if wanted. Both positive and negative chirps can be produced depending upon {{the sign of the}} undulator taper...|$|E

OttLite describes its [...] "508 technology" [...] as providing a balance of brightness and contrast that reduces glare and eyestrain and produces very low heat. The products, called [...] "High Definition Natural Lighting," [...] are marketed online and at lighting, crafting, and hardware stores worldwide.|$|R
40|$|Two {{series of}} tetroon flights across a long {{reasonably}} two-dimensional ridge with crest elevation of about 100 m were performed during the summers of 1977 and 1978. All of the tetroons were ballasted to float at an equilibrium level of 100 m above the ground. The first series {{was released in}} the daytime. Large instabilities were observed during windy neutral atmospheric conditions {{as well as on}} days with strong thermal convection. Under more stable conditions the air flow was observed to reflect the structure of the terrain more closely. The second series of tetroons was released on clear nights when stable atmospheric conditions prevailed. The <b>natural</b> <b>wavelengths</b> for these flights were approximately the same as the total base width of the ridge (~ 1. 5 km). Some implications for pollutant dispersion calculations in areas of complex terrain are discussed...|$|R

For example, microorganisms in the intestine— commonly known as [...] "gut flora"— produce vitamin K and biotin, while one form of vitamin D is synthesized in the skin {{with the help of}} the <b>natural</b> ultraviolet <b>wavelength</b> of sunlight. Humans can produce some vitamins from precursors they consume. Examples include vitamin A, produced from beta carotene, and niacin, from the amino acid tryptophan.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We report {{fabrication}} of ordered polymeric nanodomains {{and control of}} their morphology and size by self-organized intensified dewetting of ultrathin polymer films which are selectively exposed to small doses of electron beam (e-beam). Both positive and negative e-beam tone polymers are used to produce variety of highly regular patterns over large area (∼mm 2) in significantly lesser time as compared to e-beam lithography. Dewetting of selectively exposed thin films under a mixture of water and organic solvents enables the instability to grow much faster and in very confined domains. Patterns ranging from straight and cross channels, array of circular and square holes, aligned nanowires and square grid to the array of spherical droplets can be fabricated by selection of e-beam exposure patterns and the dewetting conditions. Fabrication of structures with sharp corners and edges becomes possible because of ultralow interfacial tension of polymer in the liquid mixture. Further, the length scale of pattern can be tuned {{over a wide range}} which in some case extends from about tenth of the <b>natural</b> <b>wavelength</b> of instability in dewetting (λm) to 2 λm. This is a significant improvement over the dewetting on physico...|$|E
40|$|The {{origin of}} {{periodic}} electron spatial structures in gases subject to spatially uniform electric fields E 0 has been recently analyzed through fluid equations [1] thereby providing greater physical {{understanding of the}} 'window' phenomenon in the Franck-Hertz experiment, and complementing the more accurate but purely numerical results provided by Boltzmann's equation [2]. Similar physical insight can be obtained for a spatially varying electric field, which modulates electron properties substantially if the applied <b>wavelength</b> matches the <b>natural,</b> 'Franck-Hertz' <b>wavelength,</b> simultaneously producing large phase shifts ('non-local effects'). Such cases have been analysed extensively through solutions of the Boltzmann equation [3] but never by physically tenable, benchmarked fluid modeling as described in [1, 4]...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{new method}} for {{producing}} uniformly sized metal droplets is proposed. In this method, an intermittent electromagnetic pinch {{force is applied}} to a capillary jet of liquid metal to generate fluctuations of equal interval {{on the surface of the}} jet. As the fluctuations grow, the liquid metal jet breaks into small droplets whose size depends on the frequency of the intermittent electromagnetic pinch force. The breakup of the capillary jet is numerically simulated by performing multiphase fluid flow analysis with surface tracking (volume of fluid method) and electromagnetic force analysis. The simulation results agree well with the results of model experiments. The jet breaks up into uniformly sized droplets when the frequency of the intermittent force equals the frequency that corresponds to the <b>natural</b> disturbance <b>wavelength</b> of the capillary jet...|$|R
50|$|In refraction, a wave {{crossing}} {{from one}} medium to another of different density alters its speed and direction {{upon entering the}} new medium. The ratio of the refractive indices of the media determines the degree of refraction, and is summarized by Snell's law. Light of composite <b>wavelengths</b> (<b>natural</b> sunlight) disperses into a visible spectrum passing through a prism, because of the wavelength-dependent refractive index of the prism material (dispersion); that is, each component wave within the composite light is bent a different amount.|$|R
40|$|A Monte Carlo {{simulation}} model of radiative transfer in turbid water is discussed. The {{model can be}} used to calculate characteristics of the backscattered signal from an illuminated body of water {{as a function of the}} turbidity level and spectral properties of the suspended particulates. The dependence of remote sensing applications on the concentration and spectral properties of sediments in the environmental waters is considered in terms of the model. Attention is directed to the effects of various inputs for the volume-scattering function on backscattered radiance from <b>natural</b> waters. The <b>wavelength</b> dependence of single scattering albedo is investigated...|$|R

With the emphasis on radiative transfer models, this new book covers the urgent needs for the transition from the experimental phase of microwave remote sensing to operational applications. This book covers all terrestrial aspects from clear to cloudy atmosphere, precipitation, ocean and land surfaces, vegetation, snow and ice. A chapter on new results of microwave dielectric properties of <b>natural</b> media, covering <b>wavelengths</b> from the decimetre to the submillimetre range, will be a source for further radiative transfer developments, which extends the applicability to radar and other electromagnetic tools, which include extraterrestrial objects, for example planets and comets...|$|R
40|$|The {{sunlight}} {{is responsible}} for the development and continued existence of life on earth. The deleterious effects of sunlight on biological systems are entirely due to radiation. It is widely believed that light has the greatest effect of all the environmental factors 1. While light does play an important role, very few studies have been conducted to evaluate the interaction of light with other factors 2. <b>Natural</b> sunlight includes <b>wavelengths</b> as low as 300 nm, but does not include wavelengths of 250 to 260 nm (as ozone layer blocks these wavelengths from reaching the atmosphere). Radiation in incident sunlight has shown effect on the bacterial spores and crystals 1.

40|$|Abstract—The {{hypothesis}} {{of a natural}} sophisticated RADAR tracking system affecting hornets flight was described, analyzed and developed in previous papers [1, 2] considering their (cuticle) skin complex spike elements arrays shown by electronic microscope pictures. The existence of different spike length arrays and their disposition lead, by analogy with antenna, and radio theory and practice, to the {{hypothesis of}} transmitting and receiving phased arrays antennae operating at three different wavelengths in the sub-millimetric bands. The natural photo-and piezo electric generation {{of energy in the}} hornets reported previously explain how is generated the Radio Frequency (RF) energy required for the operation of the sub-millimeter <b>wavelength</b> <b>natural</b> RADAR system. However, similar to bats, new computation results show that the operation range of hornets RADAR system is limited to less than 100 m. Recently, investigations have shown that also in the hornet tw...|$|R
40|$|While {{metamaterials}} {{research has}} been focused on engineering the electric, magnetic and nonlinear responses of periodic sub-wavelength metallic structures, we show {{for the first time that}} metamaterial structuring can also be used to engineer the luminescent properties of this metal framework. We demonstrate this experimentally by creating new luminescent bands in metallic gold. While the natural luminescence spectrum of bulk gold is dominated by a peak at about 516 nm resulting from the Fermi level to d-band transition, nanostructuring can create new, intense luminescent lines at frequencies anywhere below the <b>natural</b> band. The <b>wavelength</b> of the new artificial emission line is linked to the plasmonic mode of metamaterial and its wavelength scales with the metamaterial's unit cell size. Using optical excitation at 400 nm we observed resonant emission in the range from 640 to 710 nm, controlled by scaling the nanostructure. Similar luminescent bands were observed in cathodoluminescence experiment...|$|R
40|$|The {{precision}} of radial velocity (RV) measurements {{depends on the}} precision attained on the wavelength calibration. One of the available options is using atmospheric lines as a <b>natural,</b> freely available <b>wavelength</b> reference. Figueira et al. (2010) measured the RV of O 2 lines using HARPS and showed that the scatter was only of ∼ 10 m/s over a timescale of 6 yr. Using a simple but physically motivated empirical model, they demonstrated a {{precision of}} 2 m/s, roughly twice the average photon noise con-tribution. In this paper we {{take advantage of a}} unique opportunity to confirm the sensitivity of the telluric absorption lines RV to different atmospheric and observing conditions: by means of contemporaneous in-situ wind measurements. This oppor-tunity {{is a result of the}} work done during site testing and characterization for the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT). The HARPS spectrograph was used to monitor telluric standards while contemporaneous atmospheric data was collected using radiosondes. We quantitatively compare the information recovered by the two independent approaches...|$|R
40|$|Extending {{previous}} work [Pusztai et al., Phys. Rev. E 87, 032401 (2013) ], we {{have studied the}} formation of eutectic dendrites in a model ternary system {{within the framework of}} the phase-field theory. We have mapped out the domain in which two-phase dendritic structures grow. With increasing pulling velocity, the following sequence of growth morphologies is observed: flat front lamellae → eutectic colonies → eutectic dendrites → dendrites with target pattern → partitionless dendrites → partitionless flat front. We confirm that the two-phase and one-phase dendrites have similar forms and display a similar scaling of the dendrite tip radius with the interface free energy. It is also found that the possible eutectic patterns include the target pattern, and single- and multiarm spirals, of which the thermal fluctuations choose. The most probable number of spiral arms increases with increasing tip radius and with decreasing kinetic anisotropy. Our numerical simulations confirm that in agreement with the assumptions of a recent analysis of two-phase dendrites [Akamatsu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 105502 (2014) ], the Jackson-Hunt scaling of the eutectic wavelength with pulling velocity is obeyed in the parameter domain explored, and that the <b>natural</b> eutectic <b>wavelength</b> is proportional to the tip radius of the two-phase dendrites. Finally, we find that it is very difficult/virtually impossible to form spiraling two-phase dendrites without anisotropy, an observation that seems to contradict the expectations of Akamatsu et al. Yet, it cannot be excluded that in isotropic systems, two-phase dendrites are rare events difficult to observe in simulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{precision}} of radial velocity (RV) measurements {{depends on the}} precision attained on the wavelength calibration. One of the available options is to use atmospheric lines as a <b>natural,</b> freely available <b>wavelength</b> reference. Figueira et al. measured the RV of O 2 lines using High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) and showed that the scatter was only of ∼ 10  m s− 1 over a time-scale of 6  yr. Using a simple but physically motivated empirical model, they demonstrated a {{precision of}} 2  m s− 1, roughly twice the average photon noise contribution. In this paper, we {{take advantage of a}} unique opportunity to confirm the sensitivity of the telluric absorption lines' RV to different atmospheric and observing conditions by means of contemporaneous in situ wind measurements. This opportunity {{is a result of the}} work done during site testing and characterization for the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT). The HARPS spectrograph was used to monitor telluric standards while contemporaneous atmospheric data were collected using radiosondes. We quantitatively compare the information recovered by the two independent approaches. The RV model fitting yielded results similar to that of Figueira et al., with lower wind magnitude values and varied wind direction. The probes confirmed the average low wind magnitude and suggested that the average wind direction is a function of time as well. However, these results are affected by large uncertainty bars that probably result from a complex wind structure as a function of height. The two approaches deliver the same results in what concerns wind magnitude and agree on wind direction when fitting is done in segments of a couple of hours. Statistical tests show that the model provides a good description of the data on all time-scales, being always preferable to not fitting any atmospheric variation. The smaller the time-scale on which the fitting can be performed (down to a couple of hours), the better the description of the real physical parameters is. We then conclude that the two methods deliver compatible results, down to better than 5  m s− 1 and less than twice the estimated photon noise contribution on O 2 lines' RV measurement. However, we cannot rule out that parameters α and γ (dependence on airmass and zero-point, respectively) have a dependence on time or exhibit some cross-talk with other parameters, an issue suggested by some of the result...|$|R
40|$|The present {{understanding}} of the initiation of boudinage and folding structures is based on viscosity contrasts and stress exponents, considering an intrinsically unstable state of the layer. The criterion of localization {{is believed to be}} prescribed by geometry-material interactions, which are often encountered in natural structures. An alternative localization phenomenon has been established for ductile materials, in which instability emerges for critical material parameters and loading rates from homogeneous conditions. In this thesis, conditions are sought under which this type of instability prevails and whether localization in geological materials necessarily requires a trigger by geometric imperfections. The relevance of critical deformation conditions, material parameters and the spatial configuration of instabilities are discussed in a geological context. In order to analyze boudinage geometries, a numerical eigenmode analysis is introduced. This method allows determining <b>natural</b> frequencies and <b>wavelengths</b> of a structure and inducing perturbations on these frequencies. In the subsequent coupled thermo-mechanical simulations, using a grain size evolution and end-member flow laws, localization emerges when material softening through grain size sensitive viscous creep sets in. Pinch-and-swell structures evolve along slip lines through a positive feedback between the matrix response and material bifurcations inside the layer, independent from the mesh-discretization length scale. Since boudinage and folding are considered to express the same general instability, both structures should arise independently of the sign of the loading conditions and for identical material parameters. To this end, the link between material to energy instabilities is approached by means of bifurcation analyses of the field equations and finite element simulations of the coupled system of equations. Boudinage and folding structures develop at the same critical energy threshold, where dissipative work by temperature-sensitive creep overcomes the diffusive capacity of the layer. This finding provides basis for a unified theory for strain localization in layered ductile materials. The numerical simulations are compared to natural pinch-and-swell microstructures, tracing the adaption of grain sizes, textures and creep mechanisms in calcite veins. The switch from dislocation to diffusion creep relates to strain-rate weakening, which is induced by dissipated heat from grain size reduction, and marks the onset of continuous necking. The time-dependent sequence uncovers multiple steady states at different time intervals. Microstructurally and mechanically stable conditions are finally expressed in the pinch-and-swell end members. The major outcome {{of this study is that}} boudinage and folding can be described as the same coupled energy-mechanical bifurcation, or as one critical energy attractor. This finding allows the derivation of critical deformation conditions and fundamental material parameters directly from localized structures in the field...|$|R
