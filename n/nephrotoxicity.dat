5|$|Reports {{of severe}} and even fatal {{hepatotoxicity}} {{related to the}} use of methoxyflurane began to appear in 1966. These reports prompted anesthesiologists to subject this agent to intense and systematic scrutiny. A study published in 1973 by Cousins and Mazze demonstrated that compared with halothane, methoxyflurane produces dose-dependent and deleterious abnormalities in renal function. The authors showed that subclinical <b>nephrotoxicity</b> occurred following methoxyflurane at minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for 2.5 to 3hours (2.5 to 3MAC hours), while overt toxicity was present in all patients at dosages greater than five MAC hours. This landmark study provided a model that would be used for the assessment of the <b>nephrotoxicity</b> of volatile anesthetics for the next two decades.|$|E
5|$|The {{biodegradation}} of methoxyflurane begins {{immediately after}} the onset of exposure. The kidney and liver toxicity observed after anesthetic doses is attributable {{to one or more}} metabolites produced by O-demethylation of methoxyflurane. Significant products of this catabolic process include methoxyfluoroacetic acid (MFAA), dichloroacetic acid (DCAA), and inorganic fluoride. Methoxyflurane <b>nephrotoxicity</b> is dose dependent and irreversible, resulting from O-demethylation of methoxyflurane to fluoride and DCAA. This effect is so predictable and reproducible that methoxyflurane now serves as a pharmacologic model of fluoride-related <b>nephrotoxicity,</b> one with which newer drugs are compared. It is not entirely clear whether the fluoride itself is toxic—it may simply be a surrogate measure for some other toxic metabolite. The concurrent formation of inorganic fluoride and DCAA is unique to methoxyflurane biotransformation compared with other volatile anesthetics, and this combination is more toxic than fluoride alone. This may explain why fluoride formation from methoxyflurane is associated with <b>nephrotoxicity,</b> while fluoride formation from other volatile anesthetics (such as enflurane and sevoflurane) is not. Furthermore, the concurrent use of tetracyclines and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Each 3milliliter dose lasts {{approximately}} 30minutes. Pain relief begins after 6–8 breaths {{and continues}} {{for several minutes}} after stopping inhalation. The maximum recommended dose is 6milliliters per day or 15milliliters per week {{because of the risk}} of cumulative dose-related <b>nephrotoxicity,</b> and it should not be used on consecutive days. Despite the potential for renal impairment when used at anesthetic doses, no significant adverse effects {{have been reported in the}} literature when it is used at the lower doses (up to 6milliliters) used for producing analgesia and sedation. Due to the risk of organ (especially renal) toxicity, methoxyflurane is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, and is not recommended to be administered in conjunction with tetracyclines or other potentially nephrotoxic or enzyme-inducing drugs.|$|E
5|$|The {{first report}} of <b>nephrotoxicity</b> {{appeared}} in 1964, when Paddock and colleagues reported three cases of acute renal insufficiency, {{two of whom}} {{were found to have}} calcium oxalate crystals in the renal tubules at autopsy. In 1966, Crandell and colleagues reported a series in which 17/95 (18%) of patients developed an unusual type of nephropathy after operations in which methoxyflurane was used as a general anesthetic. This particular type of renal insufficiency was characterized by vasopressin-resistant high-output renal failure (production of large volumes of poorly concentrated urine) with a negative fluid balance, pronounced weight loss, elevation of serum sodium, chloride, osmolality and blood urea nitrogen. The urine of these patients was of a relatively fixed specific gravity and an osmolality very {{similar to that of the}} serum. Furthermore, the high urine output persisted a challenge test of fluid deprivation. Most cases resolved within 2–3 weeks, but evidence of renal dysfunction persisted for more than one year in 3 of these 17 cases (18%), and more than two years in one case (6%).|$|E
25|$|Chloroform has induced liver {{tumors in}} mice and kidney tumors in mice and rats. The {{hepatotoxicity}} and <b>nephrotoxicity</b> of chloroform {{is thought to}} be due largely to phosgene.|$|E
25|$|Those {{opposed to}} dental amalgam suggest that mercury from dental amalgam {{may lead to}} <b>nephrotoxicity,</b> neurobehavioural changes, autoimmunity, {{oxidative}} stress, autism, skin and mucosa alterations, non-specific symptoms and complaints, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{amphotericin}} B desoxycholate (AmB: {{used since}} the 1950s {{as a primary}} agent) {{is known to be}} associated with increased drug-induced <b>Nephrotoxicity</b> (Renal toxicity) impairing Renal function. Other formulations have been developed such as lipid soluble formulations to mitigate such side-effects as direct proximal and distal tubular cytotoxicity. These include liposomal amphotericin B, amphotericin B lipid complex such as Abelcet (brand) amphotericin B phospholipid complex also as AmBisome Intravenous, or Amphotec Intravenous (Generic; Amphotericin B Cholesteryl Sul) and, amphotericin B colloidal dispersion, all shown to exhibit a decrease in <b>nephrotoxicity.</b> The later was not as effective in one study as amphotericin B desoxycholate which had a 50% murine morbidity rate versus zero for the AmB colloidal dispersion.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) (≥ 1% of patients) {{associated with}} the cephalosporin therapy include: diarrhea, nausea, rash, electrolyte disturbances, and pain and inflammation at injection site. Infrequent ADRs (0.1–1% of patients) include vomiting, headache, dizziness, oral and vaginal candidiasis, pseudomembranous colitis, superinfection, eosinophilia, <b>nephrotoxicity,</b> neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and fever.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nephrotoxicity</b> (kidney damage) can {{be caused}} by tumor lysis {{syndrome}} and also due direct effects of drug clearance by the kidneys. Different drugs will affect different parts of the kidney and the toxicity may be asymptomatic (only seen on blood or urine tests) or may cause acute renal failure.|$|E
25|$|Ciclosporin {{is highly}} metabolized in {{humans and animals}} after ingestion. The {{resulting}} metabolites include cyclosporin B, C, D, E, H, L, and others. Ciclosporin metabolites {{have been found to}} have lower immunosuppressant activity than CsA (approximately <10%), and are associated with higher <b>nephrotoxicity.</b> Individual ciclosporin metabolites have been isolated and characterized but {{do not appear to be}} extensively studied.|$|E
25|$|Damage to {{the kidneys}} {{and to the}} hearing were {{a side effect of}} the early impure {{versions}} of vancomycin, and these were prominent in the clinical trials conducted in the mid-1950s. Later trials using purer forms of vancomycin found <b>nephrotoxicity</b> is an infrequent adverse effect (0.1% to 1% of patients), but this is accentuated in the presence of aminoglycosides.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous {{aciclovir}} {{may cause}} reversible <b>nephrotoxicity</b> {{in up to}} 5% to 10% of patients because of precipitation of aciclovir crystals in the kidney. Aciclovir crystalline nephropathy is more common when aciclovir is given as a rapid infusion and in patients with dehydration and preexisting renal impairment. Adequate hydration, a slower rate of infusion, and dosing based on renal function may reduce this risk.|$|E
25|$|Burimamide {{was still}} insufficiently potent for oral administration, and further {{modification}} of the structure, based on modifying the pKa of the compound, {{led to the development}} of metiamide. Metiamide was an effective agent; it was associated, however, with unacceptable <b>nephrotoxicity</b> and agranulocytosis. The toxicity was proposed to arise from the thiourea group, and similar guanidine analogues were investigated until the ultimate discovery of cimetidine. The compound was synthesized in 1972 and evaluated for toxicology by 1973. It passed all trials.|$|E
25|$|The {{potency of}} burimamide {{was still too}} low for oral administration. And efforts on further {{improvement}} of the structure, based on the structure modification in the stomach due to the acid dissociation constant of the compound, {{led to the development}} of metiamide. Metiamide was an effective agent; however, it was associated with unacceptable <b>nephrotoxicity</b> and agranulocytosis. It was proposed that the toxicity arose from the thiourea group, and similar guanidine analogues were investigated until the discovery of cimetidine, which would become the first clinically successful H2 antagonist.|$|E
25|$|MRI for imaging {{anatomical}} structures {{or blood}} flow {{do not require}} contrast agents as the varying properties of the tissues or blood provide natural contrasts. However, for more specific types of imaging {{the most commonly used}} intravenous contrast agents are based on chelates of gadolinium. In general, these agents have proved safer than the iodinated contrast agents used in X-ray radiography or CT. Anaphylactoid reactions are rare, occurring in approx. 0.03–0.1%. Of particular interest is the lower incidence of <b>nephrotoxicity,</b> compared with iodinated agents, when given at usual doses—this has made contrast-enhanced MRI scanning an option for patients with renal impairment, who would otherwise not be able to undergo contrast-enhanced CT.|$|E
25|$|ADRs {{can include}} {{enlargement}} of the gums, convulsions, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, hypercholesterolemia, dyspnea, numbness and tingling particularly of the lips, pruritus, high blood pressure, potassium retention possibly leading to hyperkalemia, kidney and liver dysfunction (<b>nephrotoxicity</b> and hepatotoxicity), burning sensations at finger tips, and an increased vulnerability to opportunistic fungal and viral infections. In short, it is nephrotoxic, neurotoxic, {{increases the risk of}} squamous cell carcinoma and infections, and often causes hypertension (due to renal vasoconstriction and increased sodium reabsorption). The latter may result in serious adverse cardiovascular events; thus it is recommended that prescribers find the lowest effective dose for people requiring long term treatment. Ciclosporin also causes {{enlargement of the}} gums and increased hair growth which is not seen with tacrolimus (another calcineurin inhibitor).|$|E
25|$|Cisplatin, a platinum-based compound, was {{discovered}} by a Michigan State University researcher, Barnett Rosenberg, working under an NCI contract. This was yet another serendipitous discovery: Rosenberg had initially wanted to explore the possible effects of an electric field on the growth of bacteria. He observed that the bacteria unexpectedly ceased to divide when placed in an electric field. Excited, he spent months of testing {{to try to explain}} this phenomenon. He was disappointed to find that the cause was an experimental artifact — the inhibition of bacterial division was pinpointed to an electrolysis product of the platinum electrode rather than the electrical field. This accidental discovery, however, soon initiated a series of investigations and studies into the effects of platinum compounds on cell division, culminating in the synthesis of cisplatin. This drug was pivotal in the cure of testicular cancer. Subsequently, Eve Wiltshaw and others at the Institute of Cancer Research in the United Kingdom extended the clinical usefulness of the platinum compounds with their development of carboplatin, a cisplatin derivative with broad antitumour activity and comparatively less <b>nephrotoxicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|It wasn't until 1962 {{until the}} first {{isolation}} of orellanine was done. The first methanolic extraction and isolation of orellanine was done by Stanisław Grzymala and isolated from the mushroom Cortinarius orellanus. Along with the isolation of orellanine, Grzymala was also able to demonstrate the <b>nephrotoxicity</b> of Cortinarius orellanus and determine various {{physical and chemical properties}} of orellanine. He found that the toxicity of the mushrooms was linked to delayed and acute renal failure, as well as when the isolated white crystalline substance was heated above 150 ̊C it began to slowly decompose. After this first isolation of orellanine, the structure of orellanine was first discovered by Antkowiak and Gessner in 1979. Orellanine’s structure was found to be 3,3',4,4'-tetrahydroxy- 2,2'-bipyridine-l,l'-dioxide. Antkowiak and Gessner were also able to determine that orellanine was the mono-N-oxide of orelline, which was the decomposition product of orellanine. It was also found that orelline was non-toxic. The first successful synthesis of orellanine was done in 1985. Tiecco, M. et. Al. completed a total synthesis of orellanine using commercially available 3-hydroxypyridine. After the first successful synthesis, the structure was confirmed in 1987 by Cohen-Addad et al. in 1987 by X-ray crystallography.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} treatment method is an intravenous injection with antimony compounds, such as pentostam. Unfortunately, these chemotherapeutics are so poisonous that about 15% {{of the patients}} die from the treaments. To compound the situation, drug resistance has evolved in the parasites against the traditional antimonials. According to rough estimates, about 40% of patients in India are already resistant to this therapy. Another antimicrobial drug amphotericin B is also commonly used. Liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) has been a drug of choice in India, but is practically useless in Africa because of low effectiveness in the African strain of the parasite. Further, amphotericin B has severe adverse effects. Its acute effects includes nausea, vomiting, rigors, fever, hypertension or hypotension, and hypoxia, and its chronic effect is <b>nephrotoxicity.</b> In 1999 an anticancer drug miltefosine was demonstrated to be highly effective (95% cure rate) among Indian patients. This {{was the first time}} an oral drug is effective for visceral leishmaniasis. Clinical trials showed that the new drug is relatively harmless. The most adverse effects were only vomiting and diarrhoea in 20–28% patients, which were rather mild. The drug has been officially approved in India. The recommended dosage is 100mg per day over a period of four weeks.|$|E
500|$|Cisplatin, or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) is {{the first}} of a series of square planar platinum(II)-containing {{chemotherapy}} drugs, including carboplatin and oxaliplatin. These compounds are capable of crosslinking DNA, and kill cells by similar pathways to alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. (Side effects of cisplatin include nausea and vomiting, hair loss, tinnitus, hearing loss, and <b>nephrotoxicity.)</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Nephrotoxicity</b> (kidney damage) {{is a major}} concern. The dose {{is reduced}} when the patient's {{creatinine}} clearance (a measure of renal function) is reduced. Adequate hydration and diuresis is used to prevent renal damage. The <b>nephrotoxicity</b> of platinum-class drugs seems {{to be related to}} reactive oxygen species and in animal models can be ameliorated by free radical scavenging agents (e.g., amifostine). <b>Nephrotoxicity</b> is a dose-limiting side effect.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{evidence}} to relate <b>nephrotoxicity</b> to vancomycin serum levels is inconsistent. Some {{studies have indicated}} an increased rate of <b>nephrotoxicity</b> when trough levels exceed 10nbsp&µg/ml, but others have not reproduced these results. <b>Nephrotoxicity</b> has also been observed with concentrations within the [...] "therapeutic" [...] range, as well. In essence, the reputation of vancomycin as a nephrotoxin is overstated, {{and it has not}} been demonstrated that maintaining vancomycin serum levels within certain ranges will prevent its nephrotoxic effects, when they do occur.|$|E

2500|$|In 1994, {{the use of}} {{vancomycin}} monotherapy {{was clearly}} documented in only three of 82 available cases in the literature. Prospective and retrospective studies attempting to evaluate the incidence of vancomycin-related <b>nephrotoxicity</b> have largely been methodologically flawed and have produced variable results. The most methodologically sound investigations indicate [...] the actual incidence of vancomycin-induced <b>nephrotoxicity</b> is around 5% to 7%. To put this into context, similar rates of renal dysfunction have been reported for cefamandole and benzylpenicillin, two reputedly non-nephrotoxic antibiotics.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent {{reviews of}} {{accumulated}} case reports of vancomycin-related <b>nephrotoxicity</b> found [...] {{many of the}} patients had also received other known nephrotoxins, in particular, aminoglycosides. Most of the rest had other confounding factors, or insufficient data regarding the possibility of such, that prohibited the clear association of vancomycin with the observed renal dysfunction.|$|E
2500|$|Immuno{{suppress}}ant {{drugs are}} used to suppress the immune system from rejecting the donor kidney. These medicines must be taken {{for the rest of}} the recipient's life. The most common medication regimen today is a mixture of tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisolone. Some recipients may instead take ciclosporin, sirolimus, or azathioprine. The risk of early rejection of the transplanted kidney is increased if corticosteroids are avoided or withdrawn after the transplantation. Ciclosporin, considered a breakthrough immunosuppressive when first discovered in the 1980s, ironically causes <b>nephrotoxicity</b> and can result in iatrogenic damage to the newly transplanted kidney. Tacrolimus, which is a similar drug, also causes <b>nephrotoxicity.</b> Blood levels of both must be monitored closely and if the recipient seems to have declining renal function or proteinuria, a biopsy may be necessary to determine whether this is due to rejection [...] or ciclosporin or tacrolimus intoxication [...]|$|E
2500|$|Likewise, SOD has {{multiple}} pharmacological activities. E.g., it ameliorates cis-platinum-induced <b>nephrotoxicity</b> in rodents. As [...] "Orgotein" [...] or [...] "ontosein", a pharmacologically-active purified bovine liver SOD, {{it is also}} effective {{in the treatment of}} urinary tract inflammatory disease in man. For a time, bovine liver SOD even had regulatory approval in several European countries for such use. This was cut short by concerns about prion disease.|$|E
2500|$|Recently, doubts {{regarding}} {{the significance of}} the phenomenon appeared in the scientific literature. Several studies have shown that Intravenous contrast material administration was not associated with excess risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), dialysis, or death, even among patients with comorbidities reported to predispose them to <b>nephrotoxicity.</b> Moreover, hydration, the most established prevention measure to prevent contrast induced nephropathy was shown to be ineffective in the POSEIDON trial, raising further doubts {{regarding the}} significance of this disease state. [...] A meta-analysis of 28 studies of AKI after CT with radiocontrast showed no causal relationship between the use of radiocontrast and AKI.|$|E
2500|$|Plasma level {{monitoring}} of vancomycin is necessary {{due to the}} drug's biexponential distribution, intermediate hydrophilicity, and potential for ototoxicity and <b>nephrotoxicity,</b> especially in populations with poor renal function and/or increased propensity to bacterial infection. Vancomycin activity {{is considered to be}} time-dependent; that is, antimicrobial activity depends on the duration that the serum drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration [...] of the target organism. Thus, peak serum levels have not been shown to correlate with efficacy or toxicity; indeed, concentration monitoring is unnecessary in most cases. Circumstances in which therapeutic drug monitoring [...] is warranted include: patients receiving concomitant aminoglycoside therapy, patients with (potentially) altered pharmacokinetic parameters, patients on haemodialysis, patients administered high-dose or prolonged treatment, and patients with impaired renal function. In such cases, trough concentrations are measured.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} March, {{veterinary}} organizations {{reported more}} than 100 pet deaths amongst nearly 500 cases of kidney failure, and experts expected the death toll to number in the thousands, with one online database already self-reporting as many as 3,600 deaths as of 11 April. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has received reports of approximately 8500 animal deaths, including at least 1950 cats and 2200 dogs who have died after eating contaminated food, but have only confirmed 14 cases, in part {{because there is no}} centralized government database of animal sickness or death in the United States as there are with humans (such as the Centers for Disease Control). For this reason, many sources speculate {{the full extent of the}} pet deaths and sicknesses caused by the contamination may never be known. In October, the results of the [...] "AAVLD survey of pet food-induced <b>nephrotoxicity</b> in North America, April to June 2007," [...] were reported, indicating 347 of 486 cases voluntarily reported by 6 June 2007 had met the diagnostic criteria, with most of the cases reported from the United States, but also including cases of 20 dogs and 7 cats reported from Canada.The cases involved 235 cats and 112 dogs, with 61 percent of the cats and 74 percent of the dogs having died. Dr. Barbara Powers, AAVLD president and director of the Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, said the survey probably found only a percentage of the actual cases. She also said the mortality rate is not likely to be representative of all cases, because survey respondents had more information to submit for animals that had died. A number of dogs were also reported affected in Australia, with four in Melbourne and a few more in Sydney. No legal action or repercussions have as yet occurred regarding these cases. Dr. Powers elaborated further: “But there absolutely could be more deaths from the tainted pet food.... This survey didn’t catch all the deaths that happened. In order to be counted in our survey, you had to meet certain criteria.... If someone had a pet that died and they buried it in their back, they weren’t eligible for our survey. We had to have confirmed exposure to the recalled pet food, proof of toxicity, and clinical signs of renal failure. So this is only a percentage of the deaths that are out there. There’s no way to guess how many pets were affected.” ...|$|E
