50|$|The <b>Northern</b> <b>Dimension</b> as an {{important}} topic for EU policy was first recognized at the Luxembourg European Council in December 1997. In the years which followed, the concept became more concrete. The Vienna European Council in December 1998 adopted a Commission Communication on a <b>Northern</b> <b>Dimension</b> for {{the policies of the}} Union. Six months later, in Cologne, the European Council adopted Guidelines for the Implementation of the <b>Northern</b> <b>Dimension.</b> In November 1999, the Finnish EU Presidency held a Ministerial Conference on the <b>Northern</b> <b>Dimension,</b> where an Inventory of current activities under the <b>Northern</b> <b>Dimension</b> was adopted. The Helsinki European Council in December 1999 invited the Commission to prepare a <b>Northern</b> <b>Dimension</b> Action Plan, and the Feira European Council in June 2000 subsequently adopted this first Action Plan for the <b>Northern</b> <b>Dimension</b> in the external and cross-border policies of the European Union, 2001-2003.|$|E

Using linear (Lee–Pearson’s) formula, brain weight and cranial capacity were estimated in 398 normal 17 to 20 -year-old males (200 native Fars and 198 Turkman) males in <b>Northern</b> Iran. The <b>dimensions</b> of the head measured with spreading caliper and auricular head spanner. The mean±S.

Cerebral Index was 3. 40 ± 0. 37 % and 2. 52 ± 0. 37 % in Native Fars and Turkmans, respectively and cerebral quotient was higher in Turkmans (8. 34) than Native Fars males (7. 95).

Three <b>dimensions</b> of output additionality are, considered extensive additionality, in which public support encourages {{a larger proportion of}} the population of firms to innovate; improved product additionality, in which there is an increase in the average importance of incremental Innovation; mew product additionality, in which there is an increase in the average importance of more radical innovation. Using an instrumental variable approach, our results are generally positive, with public support,for innovation having positive, and generally significant, extensive, improved and new product additionality affects. These results hold both for all plants and indigenously owned plants, a specific target of policy in both jurisdictions. The suggestion is that grant aid to firms can be effective in both encouraging firms to initiate new innovation and improve the quality and sophistication of their innovation activity.

40|$|Atmospheric {{dynamics}} {{are described}} {{by a set of}} partial differential equations yielding an infinite-dimensional phase space. However, the actual trajectories followed by the system appear to be constrained to a finite-dimensional phase space, i. e. a strange attractor. The dynamical properties of this attractor are difficult to determine due to the complex nature of atmospheric motions. A first step to simplify the problem is to focus on observables which affect – or are linked to phenomena which affect – human welfare and activities, such as sea-level pressure, 2  m temperature, and precipitation frequency. We make use of recent advances in dynamical systems theory to estimate two instantaneous dynamical properties of the above fields for the <b>Northern</b> Hemisphere: local <b>dimension</b> and persistence. We then use these metrics to characterize the seasonality of the different fields and their interplay. We further analyse the large-scale anomaly patterns corresponding to phase-space extremes – namely time steps at which the fields display extremes in their instantaneous dynamical properties. The analysis is based on the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data, over the period 1948 – 2013. The results show that (i)  despite the high dimensionality of atmospheric dynamics, the Northern Hemisphere sea-level pressure and temperature fields can on average be described by roughly 20 degrees of freedom; (ii)  the precipitation field has a higher dimensionality; and (iii)  the seasonal forcing modulates the variability of the dynamical indicators and affects the occurrence of phase-space extremes. We further identify a number of robust correlations between the dynamical properties of the different variables...|$|R

40|$|In {{the twentieth}} century Lithuania emerged from the {{crumbling}} Russian Empire as a post-colonial nationalising state. Its short-lived independence (1918 – 1940) fea-tured attempts to assemble the material foundations for an imagined community of Lithuanians, however in 1940 this nationalist project was disrupted by Soviet occupation. However, this article argues that regardless of the measures taken against political nationalism by the Soviets, the material work of assembling the Lithuanians as a historical and ethnic nation was not abandoned. The study analy-ses {{the ways in which}} Northern and Baltic categories were used to regionally situ-ate the ethnic identification of the Lithuanian population in Soviet and post-Soviet Lithuanian museums. The cases of the Historical-Ethnographic Museum and the Museum of Amber reveal that <b>Northern</b> and Baltic <b>dimensions</b> had to be recon-ciled with the Soviet version of the Lithuanian past. The resulting assemblage of Lithuania as a synchronic and diachronic community of inhabitants who defined themselves through shared Baltic ancestors and centuries-old uses of amber was transmitted to the post-Soviet museums. The most salient post-Soviet changes were, first, the rewriting of the relations between Lithuanians and the Nordic countries in positive terms and in this way reversing the Soviet narrative of Lithuania as a victim of aggression from the North. Second, the Soviet construc-tion of amber as a material mediator which enabled Lithuanians to connect with each other as a synchronic and diachronic imagined community was somewhat pushed aside in favour of the understanding of amber as a medium of social and cultural distinction for the ancient Balts and contemporary Lithuanian elites...|$|R
50|$|Following {{the battle}} against the undead {{outbreak}} in <b>Northern</b> France of <b>Dimension</b> 63, Doctor Ludvig Maxis, whose brain resided in a mechanical drone at the time, arrived at Agartha and was given a new body by an omnipotent being named Doctor Monty. After helping to cleanse the soul of his daughter Samantha from the original timeline, Monty instructs Maxis to retrieve an artifact called the Kronorium, an ancient book containing {{the location of the}} Summoning Key, a powerful artifact that can fix their world back to its original state. Maxis then instructs his friend Doctor Edward Richtofen to retrieve the book. Throughout his journey, Richtofen also learns of the Keepers, an ancient race who act as the wards of all universes, which Monty is also a part of. Maxis instructs Richtofen to seek out specific versions of his three former allies: Corporal Tank Dempsey, Sergeant Nikolai Belinski, and Captain Takeo Masaki. Richtofen must also kill a specific version of himself to trigger the fracturing of the universe, and acquire the souls of the other three, using the Key once it is found. Richtofen travels to Dimension 63 and arrives in Morg City in 1944, where the Apothicons, former Keepers who were corrupted and mutated by the dark energy of the Aether, manipulated four individuals: Jessica Rose, a burlesque dancer; Jack Vincent, a corrupt cop; Floyd Campbell, an up-and-coming boxer; and Nero Blackstone, a washed-up magician. Mislead into doing the biddings of an Apothicon named the Shadowman, the four opened a rift beneath the city using the Summoning Key, thereby freeing an ancient Apothicon beast. With the Keepers' aid, the four manage to trap the Shadowman inside the Key, and banish the beast from their dimension. Before they could retrieve the Summoning Key from the Keepers, however, Richtofen appears out of a portal and grabs the Key from them, thanking them for their effort and leaving through the portal, leaving the four and the rest of Dimension 63 to be doomed by the Apothicons.|$|R
