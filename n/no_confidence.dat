5|$|Local governments {{follow a}} {{modified}} version of the separation of powers used in the national government. An assembly may pass a vote of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> in the executive, in which case the executive must either dissolve the assembly within ten days or automatically lose their office. Following the next election, however, the executive remains in office unless the new assembly again passes a <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> resolution.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Fortune and Ars Technica {{relied on}} The Signpost in {{reporting}} {{a vote of}} <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> by Wikipedia editors against Arnnon Geshuri joining the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees.|$|E
6000|$|... "As Commandant of the place," [...] Captain Griffiths replied, [...] "I {{naturally}} had to {{have the}} Common searched. With the exception of the observation car, however, I think that I am betraying <b>no</b> <b>confidences</b> in telling you that we discovered nothing of interest." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{still they}} could not bring {{themselves}} to like him. They did not know him. His ways were not theirs. He gave <b>no</b> <b>confidences.</b> He repelled all probing. Youth that he was, they could never nerve themselves to dare to question him.|$|R
60|$|Why had we {{not thought}} of this before? Nothing would be more natural than that the rich and {{imperious}} Tournelli should be exclusive, and have <b>no</b> <b>confidences</b> with his enforced associates. And {{it was evident that}} Tom had noticed it and was jealous.|$|R
5|$|Nauru had 17changes of {{administration}} between 1989 and 2003. Bernard Dowiyogo died in office in March 2003 and Ludwig Scotty was elected as the president, later being re-elected {{to serve a}} full term in October 2004. Following a vote of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> on 19 December 2007, Scotty was replaced by Marcus Stephen. Stephen resigned in November 2011, and Freddie Pitcher became President. Sprent Dabwido then filed a motion of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> in Pitcher, resulting in him becoming president. Following parliamentary elections in 2013, Baron Waqa was elected president.|$|E
5|$|In the {{pre-season}} of 2008–09, {{a motion}} of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> was raised against club president Joan Laporta. This motion received 60percent support, {{just short of}} the 66percent required to oust him, prompting eight of the directors to resign. Continuing as president, Laporta made large changes to the playing staff, spending nearly €90million rebuilding the squad.|$|E
5|$|On 16 August 1938, {{after only}} serving {{a few months}} {{as a member of}} parliament, Treatt was {{appointed}} as the Minister for Justice in the government of Alexander Mair, who had become Premier after Bertram Stevens was defeated in a motion of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> in the house. In 1940, he was made a King's Counsel (KC).|$|E
60|$|But she {{remained}} alone {{now for the}} greater part of her time, and stayed in the house, or at furthest went into the garden. She shunned every one, even Liddy, and could be brought to make <b>no</b> <b>confidences,</b> and to ask for no sympathy.|$|R
60|$|Alan, {{who wished}} for <b>no</b> <b>confidences,</b> replied by asking what the Mungana {{was doing in}} the Treasure House, to which she {{answered}} that the spirits who dwelt there were eating up his soul, and when they had devoured it all he would go quite mad and kill himself.|$|R
60|$|When I reached home, I {{looked up}} my {{grandmother}} and told her everything that had happened. My excitement {{was so great that}} it was necessary I should talk to some one, and I felt a pang of regret when I remembered that latterly I had given <b>no</b> <b>confidences</b> to her.|$|R
5|$|On April 23, 2008, amid {{complaints}} {{directed toward}} CIA president Tim Ryan, the school's teachers' union approved {{a vote of}} <b>no</b> <b>confidence,</b> with a vote of 85 to 9. The faculty described poor equipment, falling academic standards, and little support in the administration for complaints as causes. The largest complaints, {{laid out in a}} thirteen-item list, included outdated technology, poorly-designed uniforms, poor-quality classes and dining hall meals, excessive tuition, students admitted with no chance of succeeding, substandard school-brand kitchen equipment, overcrowded classes and residence halls, complicated schedules, and poor record-keeping. The document described President Ryan as taking an autocratic style, ignoring staff input, and retaliating against criticism. Ryan later met with union representatives and described coming improvements in scheduling and curriculum. Immediately after the faculty's vote of <b>no</b> <b>confidence,</b> the board of trustees unanimously voted to their confidence and support of Ryan and extended his contract.|$|E
5|$|The Germans rapidly {{realised}} that Pećanac's Chetniks, whose numbers {{had grown}} to 8,000, were inefficient and unreliable, and even the Nedić government had <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> in them. They were completely disbanded by March 1943. Pećanac himself was interned by the Nedić regime for some time, and was killed by agents of Mihailović in May or June 1944.|$|E
5|$|The President of Croatia may {{dissolve}} Parliament {{upon the}} request of the government if the government proposes a confidence motion to Parliament and the majority of all deputies adopt a motion of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> or if Parliament fails to approve government budget 120 days after the budget is proposed in the parliament. That decision must be countersigned by the Prime Minister to become valid. The President may also dissolve Parliament after a motion of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> supported by a majority of all deputies has been adopted and a new government cannot be formed within 30 days or if a new government cannot be formed after general elections (maximum period of 120 days). However, the President may not dissolve Parliament at {{the request of}} the government if a procedure to determine if the President has violated provisions of the constitution is in progress.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Falk," [...] I said, {{beginning}} to lie with a glibness and effrontery that amazed me {{even at the}} time--"confidence for confidence."

60|$|Mrs. Joe made {{occasional}} {{trips with}} Uncle Pumblechook on market-days, {{to assist him}} in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a woman's judgment; Uncle Pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing <b>no</b> <b>confidences</b> in his domestic servant. This was market-day, and Mrs. Joe was out {{on one of these}} expeditions.|$|R

5|$|A Non-constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) is {{a member}} of a Singaporean {{opposition}} political party who, according to the Constitution and Parliamentary Elections Act, is declared to have been elected a Member of the Parliament of Singapore despite having lost in a general election by virtue of having been one of the best-performing losers. NCMPs enjoy most of the privileges of ordinary Members of Parliament. They are, however, not allowed to vote on several types of bills such as bills to amend the Constitution and motions of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> in the Government. An election candidate who has been offered an NCMP seat may decline to take it up.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the allied}} {{invasion}} of Sicily in 1943, Mussolini {{was removed from}} power by Victor Emmanuel III after a vote of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> of the Grand Council. Marshal Pietro Badoglio, placed {{in charge of the}} government, soon surrendered to the Allies. Throughout 1943 and 1944, the Soviet Union steadily forced Hitler's armies into retreat along the Eastern Front. On 6 June 1944, the Western Allied armies landed in northern France in one of the largest amphibious operations in history, Operation Overlord. Many German officers concluded that defeat was inevitable and that continuing under Hitler's leadership would result in the complete destruction of the country.|$|E
5|$|In the confusion, Whitlam and his {{advisers}} did not immediately tell any Senate members of the dismissal, {{with the result that}} when the Senate convened at 2.00pm, the appropriation bills were rapidly passed, with the ALP senators assuming the Opposition had given in. The bills were soon sent to Kerr to receive Royal Assent. At 2.34pm, ten minutes after supply had been secured, Fraser rose in the House and announced he was prime minister. Whitlam immediately moved a <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> motion against the new prime minister in the House, which instructed the Speaker, Gordon Scholes, to advise Kerr to reinstate Whitlam.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much for that most gratifying {{testimony}} to my powers of insight!" [...] she cried. [...] "The Mother Superior gave me <b>no</b> <b>confidences.</b> So you have been smitten by a gray-gown. How did you happen to become acquainted with her? I do not imagine they allow gentleman visitors at the House of Martha?" ...|$|R
60|$|On {{coming out}} of the colonel's quarters, Lieut. D'Hubert said nothing to the friend who was waiting outside to take him home. He said nothing to anybody. Lieut. D'Hubert made <b>no</b> <b>confidences.</b> But on the evening of that day the colonel, strolling under the elms growing near his quarters, in the company of his second in command, opened his lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dora, Dora, for Heaven's sake, I beg of you, <b>no</b> <b>confidences.</b> As a legal man, I must deprecate all confidences, {{otherwise}} than strictly {{in the way}} of business. What got {{us first}} into this absurd groove, I wonder? Oh yes, I remember--Louie's dancing. Shall we go on again? You must have got your breath by this time. Why, what's the matter, Dora? You look quite pale and flurried." ...|$|R
5|$|Neild {{began to}} {{encounter}} difficulties in {{his political career}} {{towards the end of}} the 1880s; his oversight of the establishment of the 1887 Adelaide Jubilee International Exhibition led to investigation by a Legislative Assembly select committee, which absolved him of accusations of extravagance and using his office for personal gain. In 1895 he began to agitate for old-age pensions, but in 1899 he was investigated again after Premier George Reid paid him £350 for writing a report; although Neild repaid the money, the incident was part of the pretext for a successful <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> motion in September which brought down the Reid government.|$|E
5|$|On August 23, 2002, {{dozens of}} {{members from the}} Deputy Sheriff's Association issued a vote of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> in the {{incumbent}} sheriff during {{a meeting at the}} county's courthouse. The vote, they claimed, was issued due to allegations that the sheriff made against members of the agency, in which he said they were deliberately malingering in order to reflect badly on him. The sheriff rejected the allegations as unfounded and voiced his displeasure over the vote, calling them politically motivated due to their proximity to the primary elections, which was only weeks away at the time.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, 2008 Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko {{announced}} a reshuffle {{of the cabinet}} after the forming of a BYuT, OU-PSD and Bloc of Lytvyn coalition following the 2008 Ukrainian political crisis. On March 3, 2010 the Ukrainian Parliament passed a motion of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> in the second Tymoshenko Government. A day before that the coalition had already lost the parliamentary majority. On March 11, 2010 the First Azarov Government was elected.|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Ledsam," [...] he said, [...] "I told you, {{some little}} time ago, {{that so far}} as this {{particular}} case was concerned I had <b>no</b> <b>confidences</b> to share with you.

Since you did, however, I hope you will not {{take it as a}} liberty from one in my position if I advise you most strenuously to do nothing which might impede the course of the law. Good day, sir!" ...|$|R
5|$|Once elected for a four-year-term, Federal Councillors {{can neither}} be voted {{out of office}} by a motion of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> nor can they be impeached. Re-election is {{possible}} for an indefinite number of terms. Parliament {{has decided not to}} re-elect a sitting Councillor only four times, and only twice (in 2003 and 2007) {{since the beginning of the}} 20th century. In practice, therefore, Councillors serve until they decide to resign and retire to private life, usually after three to five terms of office.|$|E
5|$|The NCMP Scheme was {{introduced}} in 1984 to ensure the presence of Opposition Members in Parliament. The NCMP Scheme serves {{to ensure that the}} voices of the minority are still heard. Thus, to qualify as an NCMP, the candidate must have won at least 15% {{of the total number of}} votes. The powers of an NCMP are restricted in Art 39(2) of the Constitution: an NCMP cannot vote on a bill to amend the Constitution; a supply, supplementary supply or final supply bill; a money bill; a vote of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> in the Government; or a motion for removing the President from office.|$|E
5|$|The king is {{the head}} of state and {{commander-in-chief}} of the army. He can declare war and peace, ratify laws and treaties, convene and close legislative sessions, call and postpone elections, dismiss the government and dissolve the parliament. The appointed government can also be dismissed through a majority vote of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> by the elected House of Representatives. After a bill is proposed by the government, it must be approved by the House of Representatives then the Senate, and becomes law after being ratified by the king. A royal veto on legislation can be overridden by a two-thirds vote in both houses. The parliament also has the right of interpellation.|$|E
25|$|Troops, officers, and {{officials}} {{of the army and}} administration are completely lost; they have <b>no</b> more <b>confidence</b> in their chiefs and have no idea to whom they should be loyal.|$|R
6000|$|However, the two {{families}} met every day, and Mrs. White called their intercourse [...] "such a boon, such a charming friendship," [...] all unaware that there was <b>no</b> real <b>confidence</b> or affection.|$|R
60|$|Christie {{kept her}} word,--asked no questions, volunteered <b>no</b> <b>confidences,</b> but heartily enjoyed the new friendship, {{and found that}} it gave to life the zest which it had lacked before. Now some one cared for her, and, better still, she could make some one happy, and in the act of lavishing the affection of her generous nature on a {{creature}} sadder and more solitary than herself, she found a satisfaction that never lost its charm. There was nothing in her possession that she did not offer Rachel, from the whole of her heart to the larger half of her little room.|$|R
