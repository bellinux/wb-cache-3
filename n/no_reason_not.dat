25|$|The Selkirk College Students' Union {{representing}} all Selkirk College students {{submitted a}} petition {{for a vote}} on continued membership in the CFS in December 2016. The CFS verified that the petition was valid in early 2017. However, no referendum was scheduled by the Canadian Federation of Students at Selkirk College. The Students' Union asserts that its members followed the process, {{and that there is}} <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>not</b> to move forward with a referendum. The CFS asserts that its ongoing dispute with the British Columbia Federation of Students means that students at Selkirk College cannot have a vote on continued membership.|$|E
25|$|Pliny {{says that}} Timaeus (born about 350 BC) {{believed}} Pytheas' {{story of the}} discovery of amber. Strabo says that Dicaearchus (died about 285BC) did not trust the stories of Pytheas. That is all the information that survives concerning the date of Pytheas' voyage. Presuming that Timaeus would not have written until after he was 20 years old in about 330BC and Dicaearchus would have needed time to write his most mature work, after 300BC, there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>not</b> to accept Henry Fanshawe Tozer's window of 330–300BC for the voyage. Some would give Timaeus an extra 5years, bringing the voyage down to 325BC at earliest. There is no further evidence.|$|E
500|$|Folk {{psychology}} retains {{characteristics of}} now obsolete theories or legends from the past. Ancient societies {{tried to explain}} the physical mysteries of nature by ascribing mental conditions to them in such statements as [...] "the sea is angry". Gradually, these everyday folk psychological explanations were replaced by more efficient scientific descriptions. Today, eliminativists argue, there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>not</b> to accept an effective scientific account of people's cognitive abilities. If such an explanation existed, {{then there would be}} no need for folk-psychological explanations of behavior, and the latter would be eliminated {{the same way as the}} mythological explanations the ancients used.|$|E

500|$|Beck {{submitted}} a supplemental filing {{in the case}} on October 13, 2009. In the supplemental filing, his attorneys argued that the joke of the Eiland-Hall website was not obvious; therefore, the website's domain name was misleading. The filing asserted: [...] "While there is absolutely nothing humorous or amusing about the statement made by Respondent in his domain name that 'Glenn Beck Raped and Murdered a Young Girl in 1990,' the average Internet user finding the domain name GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlin1990.com ("Disputed Domain Name") in a search would have <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>not</b> {{to believe that they}} will be directed to a website providing factual information (as opposed to protected criticism or similar protected speech) about Mr. Beck." ...|$|E
500|$|Indiana Congressman Charles Halleck {{gave the}} nominating speech for Willkie {{on the evening}} of June 26, arguing that Willkie's recent {{conversion}} to the Republican Party was <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>not</b> to nominate him, [...] "is the Republican Party a closed corporation? [...] Do you have to be born into it?" [...] When Halleck mentioned Willkie's name, there were initially boos from some delegates, but they were quickly drowned out by those in the public balconies, who thunderously chanted, [...] "We want Willkie!". Pryor had cut ticket allocations to delegations that were not for Willkie, and distributed thousands of standing room passes to Willkie partisans. The vocal support for Willkie among spectators led to complaints that other campaigns had been shorted in the distribution of tickets, but provided one of the convention's most dramatic moments.|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{and critics}} are divided in their {{views about the}} value of the {{recovered}} excerpts. On the one hand, Josephson is convinced that sufficient material exists for a reconstruction of the entire symphony and eagerly awaits the undertaking of this task. This view is echoed by Stearns: [...] "here's absolutely <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>not</b> to attempt a completion". Others, however, are more circumspect: Virtanen, in particular, emphasises that although the music is irrefutably late Sibelius, it has not been established beyond doubt that any of it belongs to the Eighth Symphony. Sirén, who {{played a major role in}} organising the performance of the fragments, believes that completion is impossible on the basis of existing sketches, and would be dependent on further discoveries. He also surmises that Sibelius, having rejected the work, would not have relished hearing the fragments played, a viewpoint which McKenna endorses: [...] "Watching the performance on YouTube, I could not help but think how disappointed the composer would have been to hear his unfinished music performed." [...] Reviewing the recorded excerpts in Gramophone, Andrew Mellor remarks that even if further manuscripts should come to light, the Sibelius Rights Holders would have full control over the material and would decide whether performance was appropriate. Mellor concludes: [...] "We've had to wait some 80 years to hear less than three minutes of music, and the mystery of the Eighth isn't set to unfold any more rapidly from here".|$|E

500|$|In {{previous}} films, Starfleet's {{range of}} capital ships had been predominantly {{represented by the}} Constitution class Enterprise and just five other ship classes: the Miranda class from [...] (represented by the USS Reliant), the Excelsior and the Oberth class Grissom from , and the Galaxy and Nebula classes from The Next Generation. ILM supervisor John Knoll insisted that First Contacts space battle prove the breadth of Starfleet's ship configurations. [...] "Starfleet would probably throw everything it could at the Borg, including ships we've never seen before", he reasoned. [...] "And since we figured {{a lot of the}} background action in the space battle would need to be done with computer-generated ships that needed to be built from scratch anyway, I realized there was <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>not</b> to do some new designs." [...] Alex Jaeger was appointed visual effects art director to the film and assigned the task of creating four new starships. Paramount wanted ships that would look different from a distance, so the director devised multiple hull profiles. Knoll and Jaeger had decided that the ships had to obey certain Star Trek ship precedents, with a saucer-like primary hull and elongated warp nacelles in pairs. The Akira class featured the traditional saucer section and nacelles combined with a catamaran-style double hull; the Norway class was based on the USS Voyager; the Saber class was a smaller ship with nacelles trailing off the tips of its saucer section; and the Steamrunner class featured twin nacelles trailing off the saucer and connected by an engineering section in the rear. Each design was modeled as a three-dimensional digital wire-frame model for use in the film.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1930s {{the use of}} superchargers to {{increase}} [...] "effective displacement" [...] of an aircraft engine came into common use.

2500|$|The {{concept of}} vacant niche is not {{accepted}} by all. The reason given {{is that a}} niche is a property of a species; therefore a niche does not exist if no species is present. In other words, the term {{is thought to be}} “illogical”. However, some authors who have contributed most to the formulation of the modern niche concept (Hutchinson, Elton) apparently saw no difficulties in using the term. If a niche is defined as the interrelationship of a species with all the biotic and abiotic factors affecting it, there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>not</b> to admit the possibility of additional potential interrelationships. So, it seems logical to refer to vacant niches. (see also ecological niche.) ...|$|E

2500|$|His {{position}} {{is that there is}} <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>not</b> to give equal consideration to the interests of human and nonhumans, though his principle of equality does not require identical treatment. A mouse and a man both have an interest in not being kicked, and there are no moral or logical grounds for failing to accord those interests equal weight. Interests are predicated on the ability to suffer, nothing more, and once it is established that a being has interests, those interests must be given equal consideration. Singer quotes the English philosopher Henry Sidgwick (1838–1900): [...] "The good of any one individual is of no more importance, from the point of view... of the Universe, than the good of any other." ...|$|E
2500|$|Published in 1975, Animal Liberation {{has been}} cited as a {{formative}} influence on leaders of the modern animal liberation movement.

There are far more differences, for instance, between a great ape and an oyster, for example, than between a human and a great ape, and yet the former two are lumped together as [...] "animals", whereas we are considered [...] "human" [...] in a way that supposedly differentiates us from all other [...] "animals." ...|$|E
