30|$|A {{number of}} methods for {{computing}} the coefficients U^h_i {{of the expansion}} have been developed in the uncertainty quantification literature and generally fall into two categories: intrusive and <b>non-intrusive.</b> <b>Non-intrusive</b> <b>approaches</b> attempt to estimate the coefficients of a generalized polynomial chaos expansion by solving the deterministic problem at a set of realizations of ξ. As a result, existing simulation codes can usually be used directly. In contrast, intrusive approaches, such as those based on Galerkin methods, solve a system of equations for the entire set of expansion coefficients; typically this {{requires the use of}} specially designed solvers. We shall focus on <b>non-intrusive</b> <b>approaches</b> here since they allow for the existing turbulence simulation codes to be used with minimal modification. Moreover, the set of independent parameter values can usually be run in parallel, making <b>non-intrusive</b> <b>approaches</b> more efficient.|$|R

Intrusive approaches are generally understood as those methods that require a modification of the original problem by introducing a new algebra or by directly embedding high-order polynomial expansions of the uncertain quantities in the governing equations. <b>Non-intrusive</b> <b>approaches</b> are instead based on a polynomial representations built on sparse samples of the system response to the uncertain quantities. The paper will present a standard Polynomial Chaos Expansion, an Uncertain Quantification-High Dimensional Model Representation, a Generalised Kriging model and an expansion with Tchebycheff polynomials on sparse grids.

50|$|Feedback {{analytics}} services use customer generated feedback data {{to measure}} customer experience and improve customer satisfaction. Feedback data is collected, then, using {{key performance indicators}} and feedback metrics, turned into actionable information for website improvement. Feedback analytics services provide website owners {{with the ability to}} create feedback forms that can be customized to fit the website and placed on all pages. This allows the website's users to submit feedback when they encounter a problem or have a feature request. A feedback button is visible at all times on each of the site's pages. Feedback analytics provide page- and website- level actionable data, and enable a website owner to read and manage feedback, as well as {{to get back to the}} users. The feedback is only made accessible to the website owner. This means that websites using feedback analytics are not exposed to the potential harm to their brand that feedback made public may cause. Feedback collection can be passive (using a feedback button), or active (using a feedback form set to appear in certain conditions), or both. The ability to choose the location of the button, as well as the frequency and conditions of the pop-up make feedback analytics a relatively <b>non-intrusive</b> <b>approach</b> from the point of view of the website user. Due to its measurable nature, feedback analytics data can be integrated with web analytics data, allowing website owners to understand what their users are doing on their site (using web analytics) and why they do it (using feedback analytics), in one single interface.|$|E

30|$|As {{discussed}} previously, <b>non-intrusive</b> <b>approaches</b> aim {{to compute}} the coefficients of the expansion based on independent realizations of the deterministic solution U^h(y,ξ). One can use sampling-based methods, such as Monte Carlo or Latin hypercube sampling, to compute projections onto the polynomial bases Φ.

In our case, the dimension will remain relatively low so that we can rely on direct numerical integration using quadrature techniques.

40|$|A non-intrusive {{technique}} {{for measuring the}} concentration of gaseous species in reacting and non-reacting sprays is presented. Infrared absorption {{is the basis for}} the measurement. In a two-phase situation, the light scattered by particles can be deduced by measuring extinction of wavelengths at which no absorption occurs. As a result, combined infrared extinction and scattering (IRES) is employed for two-phase flows. The technique, although based on line-of-sight absorption, {{has the potential to be}} spatially-resolved for either symmetric or asymmetric fields depending upon the deconvolution technique applied. The technique is demonstrated using a single phase methanol vapor/air free jet and non-reacting and reacting methanol sprays. To complement these results, measurements of droplet size and velocity as well as gas velocity can be achieved using other <b>non-intrusive</b> <b>approaches</b> such as phase Doppler interferometry. These complementary measurements may be combined with the concentration measurements to quantify vaporization. The results illustrate the applicability of this relatively inexpensive and simple technique which adds valuable information to the study of sprays. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

40|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of fluid flow solvers, non-intrusive uncertainty quantification techniques have been developed in aerodynamic simulations in order to compute the quantities of interest required in an optimization process, for example. The objective function is commonly expressed in terms of moments of these quantities, such as the mean, standard deviation, or even higher-order moments. Polynomial surrogate models based on polynomial chaos expansions have often been implemented in this respect. The original approach of uncertainty quantification using polynomial chaos is however intrusive. It is based on a Galerkin-type formulation of the model equations to derive the governing equations for the polynomial expansion coefficients. Third-order, indeed fourth-order moments of the polynomials are needed in this analysis. Besides, both intrusive and <b>non-intrusive</b> <b>approaches</b> call for their computation provided that higher-order moments of the quantities of interest need be post-processed. In most applications they are evaluated by Gauss quadratures, and eventually stored for use throughout the computations. In this paper analytical formulas are rather considered for the moments of the continuous polynomials of the Askey scheme, {{so that they can be}} evaluated by quadrature-free procedures instead.

30|$|This paper aims at {{investigating}} {{the adoption of}} <b>non-intrusive</b> global/local <b>approaches</b> while modeling fracture {{by means of the}} phase-field framework. A successful extension of the <b>non-intrusive</b> global/local <b>approach</b> to this setting would pave the way for a wide adoption of phase-field modeling of fracture, already well established in the research community, within legacy codes for industrial applications. Due to the extreme difference in stiffness between the global counterpart of the zone to be analized locally and its actual response when undergoing extensive cracking, the main foreseen issues are robustness, accuracy and efficiency of the fixed point iterative algorithm which {{is at the core of}} the method. These issues are tackled in this paper. We investigate the convergence performance when using the native global/local algorithm and show that the obtained results are identical to the reference phase-field solution. We also equip the global/local solution update procedure with relaxation/acceleration techniques such as Aitken’s Δ ^ 2 -method, the Symmetric Rank One and Broyden’s methods and show that the iterative convergence can be improved significantly. Results indicate that Aitken’s Δ ^ 2 -method is probably the most convenient choice for the implementation of the approach within legacy codes, as this method needs only tools already available for the so-called sub-modeling approach, a strategy routinely used in industrial contexts.|$|R

On coral reefs, methods to measure {{small changes in}} the structure of microhabitats, driven by growth of coral colonies and {{contraction of}} skeletons, are extremely limited. We used 3 D reconstructions to quantify changes in the external structure of coral colonies of tabular Acropora spp., the dominant habitat-forming corals in shallow exposed reefs across the Pacific. The volume and surface area of live colonies increased by 21 % and 22 %, respectively, in 12 months, corresponding to a mean annual linear extension of 5. 62 cm yr (± 1. 81 SE). The volume and surface area of dead skeletons decreased by 52 % and 47 %, respectively, corresponding to a mean decline in linear extension of - 29. 56 cm yr (± 7. 08 SE), which accounted for both erosion and fragmentation of dead colonies. This is the first study to use 3 D photogrammetry to assess fine-scale structural changes of entire individual colonies in situ, quantifying coral growth and contraction.
