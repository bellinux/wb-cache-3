25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Greig caused more controversy in the lead-up to the 1976 series against the West Indies. Appearing on television to discuss the coming summer, Greig's oratory created controversy when he expounded on West Indies players:I {{like to think that}} people are building these West Indians up, because I'm <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> they're as good as everyone thinks they are. I think people tend to forget it wasn't that long ago they were beaten 5–1 by the Australians and only just managed to keep their heads above water against the Indians {{just a short time ago}} as well. Sure, they've got a couple of fast bowlers, but really I don't think we're going to run into anything more sensational than Thomson and Lillee and so really I'm not all that worried about them. You must remember that the West Indians, these guys, if they get on top are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.|$|E

I'm <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> that they're individuals: they're part of a much larger thing."

[...] "We definitely wanted {{him to have a}} messianic streak", said Soderbergh, whom Law talked to during the character's creating process. The two men discussed the appearances and the behaviors of a typical anti-government conspiracy theorist. Producer Gregory Jacobs commented that [...] "what's interesting is that you're <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> about him. Is the government really hiding something and does the herbal remedy he's talking about really work? I think we all suspect {{at one time or another}} that we're not getting the whole truth, and in that sense Krumwiede represents the audience's point of view." ...|$|E
5000|$|For the 2015 World-Premiere {{production}} of 'Need To Know' written by Jonathan Caren, KCRW's Opening The Curtain relayed that [...] "Tim Cummings plays the neighbor Mark as a tightrope walk: balanced between stalker-creepy and oddly sympathetic. The play hinges on us <b>not</b> <b>really</b> being <b>sure</b> who {{this guy is}} and Mr. Cummings manages to stay {{one step ahead of}} us without telegraphing what's coming next. At the play's dramatic climax, he reveals the play's soul to be an impassioned plea for what it really takes to be an artist. His performance is worth the 90 minutes." ...|$|R

When the race started, I didn't think we were quite {{as good as we}} were yesterday (in practice), but we were able to have really good pit stops." [...] Logano, who was involved in the biggest accident of the race, [...] "The biggest thing was, I was fine the whole time, [...] I'm <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> what happened. The spotter was clearing me low. When I got down there, they checked up going into the corner and I got tagged from behind." ...|$|E

Richards says that she likes the idea that April [...] "went on a journey to try and find herself" [...] as [...] "a lot of people [...] try and do that {{because a lot of people}} get to the point where they're <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> who they are any more". Richards also discusses the motif of April's paper dolls, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is [...] "still the same person", but that she is [...] "coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings". Alexandra Hewett, who played the Young April, described the dolls as April's [...] "only real friends".|$|E
2500|$|The secretive {{attitude}} and gradual unfolding of Snape's character was broadly admired, with Stephen Fry, the UK audio books narrator, saying in 2003: [...] "Most characters like Snape {{are hard to}} love {{but there is a}} sort of ambiguity—you can’t quite decide—something sad about him—lonely and it’s fascinating when you think he’s going to be the evil one..., then slowly you get this idea he’s not so bad after all." [...] David Yates, who directed the final four films of the series, also expressed his views on the character, saying: [...] "A character like Snape, where you're <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> if he's a good guy or a bad guy, that gives you a latent tension... I think the coolest thing you can do with an audience is deny them a little bit of information." [...] Despite being less than kind, the character quickly gained popularity within fandom to a level that surprised Rowling herself. Joyce Millman suggests in her essay [...] "To Sir with Love" [...] in the book Mapping the World of Harry Potter, that Snape is derived from a tradition of Byronic heroes such as Wuthering Heights Heathcliff.|$|E
5000|$|This Platonic-style {{interpretation}} was critiqued by Hartry H. Field. Mark Balaguer {{argues that}} we do <b>not</b> <b>really</b> know for <b>sure</b> anyway whether mind-independent abstract objects exist or not; so far, we cannot prove whether Platonic realism is definitely true or false. Defending a cognitive realism, Scott Soames argues that the reason why this unsolvable conundrum has persisted, is because the ultimate constitution {{of the meaning of}} concepts and propositions was misconceived.|$|R
40|$|Child {{care and}} housing {{programs}} in the U. S. are marked by quality homogeneity, restricted eligibility, rationing, and co-payments that increase as recipients' income rises. Why? I show that these program can best be explained as attempts to reduce the child care or housing "poverty gaps," subject to constraints that require that recipients be treated quite well. Such constraints are justified when the public is <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> whether the government is acting generously...|$|R
5000|$|Along {{with the}} rest of the album (apart from [...] "Pure Morning"), [...] "Every You Every Me" [...] was {{recorded}} in early 1998 at Real World Studios with Steve Osborne. When asked who it was about, Brian Molko replied with [...] "Who's it about? I'm <b>not</b> <b>really</b> too <b>sure</b> just yet. I think it's about a lot of people. Probably anybody... everybody who's had the displeasure of sleeping with me." [...] About his choice to include it in the Cruel Intentions soundtrack, Molko said that he [...] "studied drama, I know the original (Dangerous Liaisons) and we watched it on the tour bus when they wanted to use our song. I said: 'If he doesn't die in the end, if it's a happy ending, we don't do it.' It's quite perverted and manipulative, so the theme of the song fits in quite well." ...|$|R
2500|$|The storyline {{received}} positive {{attention from}} critics. Dianne Butler, {{writing for the}} Herald Sun, quipped [...] "the bride and groom give {{a bit of a}} shudder when Paul Robinson arrives at their door {{on the morning of the}} wedding, but I think that's most people's reaction any time Paul shows up. But it's a lovely day – yellow roses, Karl doesn't sing – apart from the robbery, and the screaming and the ambulances. Neighbours eh? Brilliant. Nobody's done a wedding like this in years." [...] Kate Lucey from Sugar called [...] "Neighbours: The Explosion" [...] one of the serial's [...] "biggest storylines of the year" [...] and included it in her feature on upcoming dramatic soap storylines. Lucey said [...] "With an upcoming fire in the Rovers Return for Coronation Street, an explosion in Neighbours and the newly announced plans for a pregnancy in EastEnders, we're <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> where to look first." [...] Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy stated that the explosion was [...] "one of 2013's biggest storylines."

2500|$|On June 2, 1976, {{the eve of}} {{the first}} test match of the series, England captain Tony Greig was {{interview}}ed on BBC’s midweek sports program Sportsnight. The interview was conducted on the roof of Hove’s Pavilion in Sussex. In the interview, Greig was forced to respond to questions concerning England’s chances of winning the series against the young West Indies' side. Greig described being unimpressed by the West Indian squad. He described the West Indies recent humiliating defeat in Australia and their tumultuous home series against India. Greig explained, [...] "I like to think that people are building these West Indians up, because I am <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> they’re as good as everyone thinks they are.” He then notoriously claimed, “Sure, they’ve got a couple of fast bowlers, but… you must remember that (if) the West Indian get on top they are magnificent cricketers, but if they’re down, they grovel. And I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.” The insensitive comments only inflamed the racial and colonial implications surrounding the 1976 series. The remark was particularly provocative coming from Greig, the white South African captain of England.|$|E
2500|$|The West Indies toured England in 1976, {{and though}} Holding was {{unknown in the}} country the British press picked up on his {{performance}} in Australia {{and there was a}} sense of anticipation about his bowling. An early psychological blow was landed by the West Indies in a warm up match against the Marylebone Cricket Club when Holding struck Dennis Amiss on the head, leaving a wound that needed stitches. Amiss was a veteran player and likely to open for England in the forthcoming Tests and seeing him struggle against Holding's pace was a warning of things to come. In the lead up to the series England captain Tony Greig was confident of his team's chances, saying in an interview [...] "I like to think people are building these West Indians up, because I'm <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> they're as good as everyone thinks. You must remember, that the West Indians, these guys, if they get on top they are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey [...] and a few others, to make them grovel." [...] The comments outraged the West Indians, and to the team the use of the term [...] "grovel" [...] in particular [...] "smacked of racism and apartheid".|$|E

The math teacher has proclaimed this child a genius: he understands ideas that others won't get for years. No wonder he has trouble talking to the other kids [...] . he’s just way beyond them. The English teacher thinks it's something different-Jason seems bright in math, but in English he's nowhere. She's <b>not</b> always <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> he knows the meaning of all those words he uses-she's not sure {{he should have been}} grade skipped. You know if you went in the hall and asked Jason's classmates, they'd have a diagnosis: geek, dweeb. Jason's parents simply look confused. They've come here for help, but it seems like a futile effort. Now the special education teacher pipes up: Jason isn't gifted, he's got Asperger's Syndrome. What's the problem with this scenario?

2500|$|... "Stay" [...] is a pop ballad that {{consists}} of piano and guitar instrumentation. It is written in the key of A minor, having the chord progression of C-Dm-Am-F. The song has a moderate tempo of 112 beats per minute. Rihanna's vocal range in the song ranges from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. Greg Kot for the Chicago Tribune described the song as being [...] "stripped-bare". The lyrics revolve around [...] "failing to resist true love", according to Dan Martin for NME, as Rihanna sings [...] "Funny, you're the broken one/ But I'm {{the only one who}} needed saving." [...] According to Jocelyn Vena for MTV, Rihanna [...] "punctuates the emotions of the track" [...] on the lyric [...] "It's not much of a life you're living/ It's not just something you take [...] given." [...] Rihanna also makes a plea to her lover, singing [...] "'Round and around and around and around we go/ Now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know/ <b>Not</b> <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> how to feel about it/ Something in the way you move/ Makes me feel like I can't live without you/ it takes me all the way/ I want you to stay." [...] Lewis Corner for Digital Spy wrote that Rihanna's vocals glow over the simple yet effective piano riffs.|$|E
2500|$|The show's other {{prominent}} pairing, Nathan and Haley, {{emerged as a}} supercouple. James Lafferty, Nathan's portrayer, said, [...] "I think Nathan and Haley... Well Schwahn always says that he had that sort of as an 'ace in the hole' the entire time. As he was writing the pilot script, he was planning on doing that, he really didn't know how it would pan out or what would happen. But, the fans have responded so passionately towards it, and I'm <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> why." [...] However, Lafferty has said {{that there is a}} genuine relationship between Nathan and Haley: [...] "It started as something sort of based on betrayal and deceit. It then kind of transgressed over into something based on actual true love. So, I think that it's a transition that the fans really bought into, and I think that people really enjoy to watch." [...] Schwahn called the couple [...] "gold" [...] and said, [...] "I love Nathan and Haley, and most of our audience does as well." [...] He explained that Nathan and Haley's fan base is strong because they have always been the most stable couple on the show, admitting that it confuses him when people ask when he is going to let them be happy. [...] "They have a lot of obstacles come their way," [...] said Schwahn, [...] "but I see them growing– especially with the jump [...] ahead and aging them a little bit– I see them growing into some really great places, not only as individuals, but as a family." ...|$|E

Ron Entwistle is co-writer and co-producer of [...] "Weird", which Duff said is [...] "about someone that she's still obsessed with. And everything he does is like he says this, but he does this ... She's <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> who he is or what he does, but she likes it." [...] Kevin De Clue contributed to [...] "The Last Song" [...] and [...] "Mr. James Dean" [...] (both co-produced by Haylie), which Duff has named her favorite track on the album and described as [...] "very funny"; in the song, she tells an ex-boyfriend that he'll [...] "never be James Dean". Duff neither confirmed nor denied whether the song was about fellow singer Aaron Carter, and she said [...] "it was definitely an experience that I went through that was interesting and I {{learned a lot from}} that time in my life." [...] In [...] "Hide Away", co-produced and co-written by Shaun Shankel, Duff discusses a relationship that isn't working because she is in a position where her life is [...] "figuratively under the microscope". Diane Warren wrote [...] "I Am", an empowerment song in which Duff lists positive and negative aspects about herself; she has said it is about being comfortable [...] "with all those feelings ... being who you are".

40|$|Conclusion: The {{students}} received good grades from Phase I library instruction, however did they really learn what we targeted?

We were able to forge a great relationship with the Communication Studies Director– the libraries’ liaison and the Communication Studies Director authored a textbook chapter together about the library for all COM 101 classes. Last but not least, collaboration in an open communicative environment took the fear out of assessment: everyone understood we were assessing the PROCESS not the person, for the success of our students; the focus was learning outcomes and supporting our students for academic success and lifelong learning...|$|R

At the same time he wrote to Sir Francis Walsingham, and to his grandfather, but with great caution, lest his letters should be {{inspected}} by his enemies, and with the less hope of their availing him because it was probable that the Ambassador would return home on the king's death.
