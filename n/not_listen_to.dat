5|$|Fàbregas' {{increase}} in exposure drew transfer speculation during the summer; Real Madrid {{expressed a desire}} to sign the Spaniard despite his long-term contract with Arsenal, but Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger stated that Arsenal would <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> any offers. In September 2006, with six years left on his deal, Arsenal offered a new five-year deal (with an option to extend by a further three years) to the midfielder, which he signed on 19 October 2006. While the contract was unusually long, Fàbregas cited Arsenal's playing style and Wenger as reasons for his long-term commitment to the club.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Waugh {{accepted}} {{a fee of}} £250 from the BBC for an adaptation of Pinfold, as a radio play, by Michael Bakewell. The broadcast, on 7 June 1960, was well received by the critics, although Waugh did <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> it. In September 1977 a staged version of the book, written by Ronald Harwood and directed by Michael Elliott, opened at the Royal Exchange theatre, Manchester. The play was brought to London, and performed at the Roundhouse Theatre in February 1979, where Michael Hordern's depiction of Pinfold was highly praised—"a man suffering from chronic indigestion of the soul".|$|E
5|$|Noda is a {{self-reliant}} {{young man}} who executes the strategies formed by the SSS and fights with a halberd. He does <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> anyone other than Yuri, for whom he has adoration, and is antagonistic to almost everyone else. He has a one-sided rivalry with Otonashi. He is a complete idiot whose weakness is education; at one point, Takeyama is able to knock him out by reciting pi. He {{is not afraid to}} harm or kill anyone who gets in Yuri's way. Though he prefers to fight with his halberd, he sometimes uses guns out of necessity, the type of weaponry that he hates.|$|E

The mouse suggests Thumbelina marry her neighbor, a mole, but Thumbelina finds repulsive {{the prospect of being}} married to such a creature because he spent all his days underground and never saw the sun or sky. The field mouse keeps pushing Thumbelina into the marriage, saying the mole is a good match for her, and does <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> her protests.|$|E
5|$|Charizard {{appeared}} {{as the main}} Pokémon in the short novel, Charizard Go! Adapted by Tracey West, the novelisation retells Ash's journey with his Charmander, and it reaches its climax as Ash and Charizard battle in the Pokémon League at the Indigo Plateau against his good friend Ritchie. The story covers Ash and his companions finding the abandoned Charmander, the battles in which Charmeleon did <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> Ash, and Charizard's battle against Blaine's Magmar. Charizard Go! is the sixth novel in the Pokémon Chapter Books series. Another chapter novel, All Fired Up: Pokémon the Johto Journeys, adapted by Jennifer Johnson, covers the portion of Ash's journey near Violet City and the Characific Valley. In the novel, Ash wonders if Charizard should leave his team forever; it covers the capture of Ash's Cyndaquil, his new fire Pokémon.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his years}} in the Philippines, Taft was keenly {{interested}} as president in East Asian affairs. Taft considered relations with Europe relatively unimportant, {{but because of the}} potential for trade and investment, Taft ranked the post of minister to China as most important in the Foreign Service. Knox did not agree, and declined a suggestion that he go to Peking to view the facts on the ground. Taft considered Roosevelt's minister there, William W. Rockhill, as uninterested in the China trade, and replaced him with William J. Calhoun, whom McKinley and Roosevelt had sent on several foreign missions. Knox did <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> Calhoun on policy, and there were often conflicts. Taft and Knox tried unsuccessfully to extend John Hay's Open Door Policy to Manchuria.|$|E

5|$|Bush {{met with}} Roosevelt and Vice President Henry A. Wallace on October 9, 1941, {{to discuss the}} project. He briefed Roosevelt on Tube Alloys, the British atomic bomb project and its Maud Committee, which had {{concluded}} that an atomic bomb was feasible, and on the German nuclear energy project, about which little was known. Roosevelt approved and expedited the atomic program. To control it, he created a Top Policy Group consisting of himself—although he never attended a meeting—Wallace, Bush, Conant, Stimson and the Chief of Staff of the Army, General George Marshall. On Bush's advice, Roosevelt chose the army to run the project rather than the navy, although the navy had shown far more interest in the field, and was already conducting research into atomic energy for powering ships. Bush's negative experiences with the Navy had convinced him that it would <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> his advice, and could not handle large-scale construction projects.|$|E

25|$|My {{grandfather}} Thorgny {{could well}} remember the Uppsala king Eirik Eymundson, {{and used to}} say of him {{that when he was}} in his best years he went out every summer on expeditions to different countries, and conquered for himself Finland, Kirjalaland, Courland, Esthonia, and the eastern countries all around; and at the present day the earth-bulwarks, ramparts, and other great works which he made are to be seen. And, more over, he was not so proud that he would <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> people who had anything to say to him.|$|E
25|$|Music {{has been}} found to be an {{effective}} tool for music therapists through extensive research. It is beneficial for any individual, both physically and mentally, through improved heart rate, reduced anxiety, stimulation of the brain, and improved learning. Music therapists use their techniques to help their patients in many areas, ranging from stress relief before and after surgeries, to neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease. One study found that children who listened to music while having an IV inserted into their arms showed less distress and felt less pain than the children who did <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> music while having an IV inserted.|$|E
25|$|After God created Adam, who was alone, He said, 'It is {{not good}} for man to be alone.' He then created a woman for Adam, from the earth, as He had created Adam himself, and called her Lilith. Adam and Lilith {{immediately}} began to fight. She said, 'I will not lie below,' and he said, 'I will not lie beneath you, but only on top. For you are fit only to be in the bottom position, while I am to be the superior one.' Lilith responded, 'We are equal to each other inasmuch as we were both created from the earth.' But they would <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> one another. When Lilith saw this, she pronounced the Ineffable Name and flew away into the air.|$|E

25|$|Cavezzali {{cited the}} initial {{investigation}} as {{alleging that the}} officers were not always on the bridge and had not remarked on the falling atmospheric pressure. They had neither established the ship's position in relation to fixed points on the shore nor used the radar to monitor the ship's distance from the shore. More seriously, no-one aboard was monitoring the VHF radio and no-one took account of a weather report received from Malta. The initial investigation also alleged that no-one raised the alarm at 1400 hrs when the storm developed (This is contradicted by another source that states the Chief Officer raised the general alarm at 1330 hrs {{when he saw the}} ship was getting closer to the shore.) The initial investigation also alleged that the radio officer did <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the VHF radio at the scheduled times.|$|E
25|$|At first Genie {{usually did}} <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> anyone unless someone {{directly}} addressed her or if Curtiss played classical {{music on the}} piano, and if someone spoke to her she almost never acknowledged the other person and usually walked away after a while. In {{an effort to get}} Genie to listen to other people Curtiss began reading children's stories to her, and at first she did not seem to engage, but one day in mid-October 1971 Curtiss saw that Genie was clearly listening and responding to her. After that she paid attention to people even when they were not speaking directly to or about her. She became somewhat more sociable in her interactions with people and became somewhat more responsive, although she still frequently showed no obvious signs that she heard someone. Her reactions to most stimuli became more rapid, but even by the end of her stay she sometimes took several minutes before giving a response to somebody.|$|E
25|$|However, {{he later}} {{wrote in his}} report that he blamed Pakistan's poor {{performance}} in the matches on player Shahid Afridi. Younis submitted the report to the PCB where it was somehow leaked to the media. He expressed his anger {{and said that the}} report was confidential – it caused fans, on social media sites, to express disappointment in him to see him shifting the blame onto Afridi. Younis, in the report, accused Afridi of being 'non-serious' during the matches and said Mohammad Hafeez hid his knee injury as well, which also affected their performance. He also said Afridi either performed poorly himself, or that other players did <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> him as a captain. Regarding the report, he said the PCB (Pakistan Cricket Board) were painting him as the bad guy and skipped meeting with him regarding the issue later on as it is most likely that they leaked the report. He then also scrapped plans of retirement and said he wanted to focus on the leak, despite his contract as coach ending in June 2016.|$|E
