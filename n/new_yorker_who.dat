5|$|Israel is a 58-year-old <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> <b>who</b> {{decided he}} couldn't be gay and Orthodox, {{and turned his}} back on his religion, though not before his family forced him into {{electroshock}} therapy to try to cure him. Now a tour guide in the Haredi neighborhoods of New York, the film follows him as he gives a tour, psychoanalyzes himself and decides, on the 25th anniversary of being with his life partner, to call his 98-year-old father, a rabbi, whom he has not seen in over twenty years.|$|E
5|$|Peter, Joe, Cleveland, and Quagmire win {{a costume}} contest as {{characters}} from The A-Team (because {{they had an}} actual black guy as B. A. Baracus and the other team had a Jewish man for the same role). The four men find Brian, {{who is writing a}} report for the local newspaper. When Peter and his friends win the costume contest, Brian writes a report about it, and is later telephoned by a member of The <b>New</b> <b>Yorker,</b> <b>who</b> tell him they would like him to work for their magazine. Brian is initially given a warm welcome by the staff, but he is immediately fired after he informs them he never graduated from college. Meanwhile, disappointed at no longer being able to be The A-Team, Peter decides to become an unofficial A-Team alongside Joe, Cleveland, and Quagmire, and decide to help their local community. Peter designs a replica of the van used by The A-Team.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Munch and Kellerman {{investigate}} a murder at Oriole Park at Camden Yards during a late-season baseball game, leaving 48,000 possible suspects. The Long Island man, presumably a Yankees fan, is found {{beaten to death}} on the stairs of the stadium, and the governor of Maryland pressures the police department to solve the murder before the game ends so that millions in tourism dollars and ticket revenues will not be jeopardized. After several fruitless interviews, Munch and Kellerman question Scott Russell (Brian Tarantina), a <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> <b>who</b> attended the game with the victim. Russell admits he killed the victim because he said the Baltimore Orioles were a better team than the Yankees. He agrees to confess to the murder if they let him watch {{the rest of the}} game. Back at the police department, Falsone continues questioning detectives about the Luther Mahoney shooting. Stivers expresses concern to Lewis that their covering for Kellerman's role in the shooting could bring both of them down if Falsone continues his questioning.|$|E

5|$|From Ozone Park, {{he moved}} to Manhattan, where a counter-cultural {{community}} had built up around the Greenwich Village and the Lower East Side that contained an array of gay people, hippies, occultists and others adopting bohemian lifestyles. Without money, he resorted to working as a rent boy, and made use of both marijuana and LSD. Although he briefly returned to Catholicism, in 1971 he read a copy of Witchcraft Today (1954), a book authored by Englishman Gerald Gardner, the founder of Gardnerian Wicca, and it reignited his interest in Pagan religion. In the autumn, he tracked down Leo Martello (1931–2000), a prominent gay rights activist and Pagan Witch who practiced his own Italian-focused form of the Craft known as the Strega tradition. Although he felt that Buczynski was too inexperienced in magic to begin practicing Strega Craft, Martello befriended and shared his contacts with the young man, and took him {{with him on a}} visit to Herman Slater (1935–1992), a fellow <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> <b>who</b> was of Jewish heritage. Like Buczynski and Martello, Slater was gay, and a romantic relationship soon developed between Buczynski – who was attracted to bears – and the older man. Buczynski moved in with Slater to an apartment in the Brooklyn Heights in June 1972.|$|E

500|$|Opening night {{reviews of}} the musical were {{strongly}} positive. [...] Richard Watts in the New York Post termed it [...] "nother triumph for the masters". Critic John Mason Brown stated, [...] "They have done it again." [...] The New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson wrote: [...] "This time Messrs. Rodgers and Hammerstein are not breaking any fresh trails, but they are accomplished artists of song and words in the theater; and The King and I is a beautiful and lovable musical play." [...] Barely less enthusiastic was John Lardner in The <b>New</b> <b>Yorker,</b> <b>who</b> wrote, [...] "Even {{those of us who}} find [...] a little too unremittingly wholesome are bound to take pleasure in the high spirits and technical skill that their authors, and producers, have put into them." [...] Otis Guernsey wrote for the New York Herald Tribune, [...] "Musicals and leading men {{will never be the same}} after last night... Brynner set an example that will be hard to follow...

500|$|Unknown (also {{known as}} Unknown Worlds) was an American pulp fantasy fiction magazine, {{published}} from 1939 to 1943 by Street & Smith, and edited by John W. Campbell. [...] Unknown was {{a companion to}} Street & Smith's science fiction pulp, Astounding Science Fiction, which was also edited by Campbell at the time; many authors and illustrators contributed to both magazines. [...] The leading fantasy magazine in the 1930s was Weird Tales, which focused on shock and horror. Campbell wanted to publish a fantasy magazine with more finesse and humor than Weird Tales, and put his plans into action when Eric Frank Russell sent him the manuscript of his novel Sinister Barrier, about aliens who own the human race. Unknowns first issue appeared in March 1939; in addition to Sinister Barrier, it included H. L. Gold's [...] "Trouble With Water", a humorous fantasy about a <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> <b>who</b> meets a water gnome. [...] Gold's story {{was the first of}} many in Unknown to combine commonplace reality with the fantastic.|$|E
500|$|Streep portrayed Roberta Guaspari, {{a real-life}} <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> <b>who</b> found passion and {{enlightenment}} teaching violin to the inner-city kids of East Harlem, {{in the music}} drama Music of the Heart (1999). A departure from director Wes Craven's previous work in films like A Nightmare on Elm Street and the Scream series, Streep replaced singer Madonna, who left the project before filming began due to creative differences with Craven. Required to perform on the violin, Streep went through two months of intense training, five to six hours a day. Streep received nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance. Roger Ebert wrote that [...] "Meryl Streep is known for her mastery of accents; she {{may be the most}} versatile speaker in the movies. Here you might think she has no accent, unless you've heard her real speaking voice; then you realize that Guaspari's speaking style is no less a particular achievement than Streep's other accents. This is not Streep's voice, but someone else's – with a certain flat quality, as if later education and refinement came after a somewhat unsophisticated childhood." ...|$|E

500|$|Campbell's {{plans for}} Unknown {{were laid out}} in the February 1939 issue of Astounding, in the {{announcement}} of the new magazine. He argued that [...] "it has been the quality of the fantasy that you have read in the past that has made the very word anathema ... will offer fantasy of a quality so far different from that which has appeared in the past as to change your entire understanding of the term". The first issue, the following month, led with Russell's Sinister Barrier, the novel that had persuaded Campbell to set his plans for a fantasy magazine into motion: the plot, involving aliens who own the human race, has been described by sf historian Mike Ashley as [...] "a strange mixture of science fiction and occult fantasy". Campbell asked Russell for revisions to the story to emphasize the fantastic elements, but still demanded that Russell work out the logical implications of his premises. This became a defining characteristic of the fiction published in Unknown; in Ashley's words, Campbell [...] "brought the science fiction rationale to fantasy". [...] The first issue also contained Horace L. Gold's [...] "Trouble with Water", a comic fantasy about a modern <b>New</b> <b>Yorker</b> <b>who</b> offends a water gnome; in its whimsicality and naturalistic merging of a modern background with a classic fantasy trope, [...] "Trouble with Water" [...] was a better indication than Sinister Barrier of the direction Unknown would take. [...] Campbell commented in a letter at the time that Sinister Barrier, [...] "Trouble with Water", and Where Angels Fear ... by Manly Wade Wellman were the only stories in the first issue that accurately reflected his goals for the magazine.|$|E
