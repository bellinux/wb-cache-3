5000|$|In a {{conventional}} steam locomotive, the crankshaft {{is one of}} the <b>driving</b> <b>axles.</b> In a jackshaft-driven steam locomotive, the crankshaft turns a jackshaft which, in turn, turns the driver. Some steam locomotives have had designs intermediate between these extremes, with crankshafts distinct from the <b>driving</b> <b>axle.</b> Phineas Davis's first B&O Grasshopper tested on the B&O in 1831 was in this class, as was the Stockton and Darlington Railway's Swift from 1836, where the crankshaft was directly between the <b>driving</b> <b>axles.</b> [...] Both of these examples used vertical cylinders, with the crankshaft in the plane of the <b>driving</b> <b>axles.</b> The former used a geared drive to the first <b>driving</b> <b>axle,</b> the latter used side rods for this linkage. In the latter case, the reason inferred for using a crankshaft distinct from the driven axles was [...] "to take the shocks of working away from the power shaft." ...|$|R
50|$|The Renault PR180.2 was {{designed}} around {{an interesting and}} unusual concept. Most articulated buses only have one <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> - either the centre axle or the rear axle, however, the PR180.2 features two <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> - centre and rear.|$|R
50|$|A slow-running, large {{series-wound motor}} with 28 poles and two commutators drove the wheels, without any gear reduction, via an {{unsprung}} jackshaft. The jackshaft was linked by a coupling rod to three <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> {{housed in the}} locomotive frame. The axle base of the <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> was 2000 mm. The jackshaft was located {{between the first and}} second <b>driving</b> <b>axles.</b> The first and third <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> were fixed to the frame, the centre one had transverse play to facilitate curve running. The mass was further distributed to two carrying axles that were designed as Adams axles. Control was achieved by means of a variable transformer (Drehtransformator) and power circuit breaker (Lastschalter) with 11 steps.|$|R
50|$|This design {{proved so}} {{effective}} on American railroads {{that many of}} the early 0-4-0s were rebuilt as 4-2-0s. The 4-2-0 excelled in its ability to stay on the track, especially those with the single <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> behind the firebox, whose main virtue was stability. However, with only one <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> behind the firebox, the locomotive's weight was spread over a small proportion of powered wheels, which substantially reduced its adhesive weight. On 4-2-0 locomotives which had the <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> in front of the firebox, adhesive weight was increased. While this plan placed more of the locomotive's weight on the <b>driving</b> <b>axle,</b> it reduced the weight on the leading truck which made it more prone to derailments.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Firstly, {{based on}} the {{theories}} and methods of acoustic intensity measurement, the surface radiation noise of the rear <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> of minibus was tested in the bench experiment. With {{the analysis of the}} experiment data, sound power was calculated to plot the noise distribution of the rear <b>driving</b> <b>axle.</b> It was found that the major noise source closed to the case of main reducer of the <b>driving</b> <b>axle.</b> The major noise frequencies are related to the gear meshing vibration. These results basically coincide with the acoustic array experimental results...|$|R
5000|$|A more {{practical}} solution, first put into production by Norris, relocated the <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> to a {{location on the}} frame {{in front of the}} locomotive's firebox. This was done because Baldwin refused to grant rights to Norris to use his patented [...] "half-crank" [...] arrangement. Cantilevering the weight of the firebox and the locomotive crew behind the <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> placed more weight on the <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> without substantially reducing the weight on the leading truck. However, Norris's design led to a shorter wheelbase, which tended to offset any gains in tractive force on the <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> by reducing the locomotive's overall stability. A number of Norris locomotives were imported into England for use on the Birmingham and Bristol Railway since, because of the challenges presented by the Lickey Incline, British manufacturers declined to supply.|$|R

50|$|In the past, many {{different}} types of bogie (truck) have been used under tramcars (e.g. Brill, Peckham, maximum traction). A maximum traction truck has one <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> with large wheels and one nondriving axle with smaller wheels. The bogie pivot is located off-centre, so more than half the weight rests on the <b>driving</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|R

50|$|Bavaria's {{state-owned}} railway chose {{a different}} way: They also used P, S, or G {{to indicate the}} train type, but combined with the numbers of <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> and of the axles in total, separated by a slash (similar to the Swiss system). E. g., the famous S 3/6 was a 2'C1' or 4-6-2 Pacific, meaning that {{of a total of}} 6 <b>axles,</b> 3 were <b>driving</b> <b>axles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The valves {{are driven}} from an {{eccentric}} cam mounted {{on one of}} the <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> and linkage from the crosshead.

50|$|With cast frames (a few had frames {{flame cut}} from rolled steel slabs) and cast wheels, the front two <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> were sprung {{independently}} {{from the rear}} two <b>driving</b> <b>axles,</b> to allow for running on poor quality track. The larger tender layout {{was derived from the}} similar design for the WD Austerity 2-8-0, with the coal bunker inset above the water tank to improve visibility when running backwards.|$|R

50|$|The seven <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> {{were laid}} out 1.7 m apart, giving a very long rigid {{wheelbase}} of 10 m. This required adaptations to negotiate curves. The center three <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> were blind, and the first and seventh <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> were fitted with lateral motion devices. These measures were {{not enough to make}} the AA20-1 work properly, however. It was prone to frequent derailments, and despite its large number of wheels, it was still too heavy for the track. As a result of its long wheelbase, the AA20-1 also spread the track and wrecked the points of the switches it passed over. It was too big to fit on the turntables, too powerful for the couplers in use at the time and unable to run at full power for very long due to its undersized boiler.|$|R
25|$|One {{solution}} to the problem was the Crampton design, in which the <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> was moved behind the boiler's firebox. These engines were relatively long in comparison to their contemporaries, and had long rigid frames, sometimes with as many as three carrying axles ahead of the <b>driving</b> <b>axle,</b> creating a 6-2-0 wheel arrangement. Cramptons were most popular in France and Germany, but some were also used in England, by companies including the London & North Western Railway (LNWR).|$|R
2500|$|Cornwall was {{an attempt}} to avoid the {{damaging}} long wheelbase of the Cramptons, whilst still permitting large driving wheels. By moving the <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> ahead of the firebox, one of the carrying axles could be moved backwards, giving a shorter overall wheelbase. The difficulty of how to fit the axles past the boiler recurred, to which Trevithick provided an [...] "extremely complicated" [...] solution. The boiler was placed entirely underneath the <b>driving</b> <b>axle.</b> Even then, it was necessary to recess a transverse channel {{across the top of the}} boiler, so as to provide clearance for the <b>driving</b> <b>axle.</b> The trailing carrying axle passed through a crosswise tube through the middle of the firebox. This made assembly difficult, but as it was only a straight carrying axle rather than a cranked <b>driving</b> <b>axle,</b> the tube diameter required was manageable. This use of a cross-firebox axle tube was part of Crampton's patent of 1842. As completed in 1847, and first numbered 173, Cornwall was a 4-2-2 with 8'6" [...] drivers, paired leading wheels of 3'6", single trailing wheels of 4' and an overall wheelbase of 16'6".

50|$|A strong chassis is {{required}} to both support the extra ballast weight and pulling forces transmitted by the drawbar. A reinforced chassis also allows multiple tractors to be coupled together to maximize power and traction. Heavy-duty versions of commercial tractor units may be fitted with a ballast box and suitable drawgear, or a ballast tractor may be purpose-built. Ballast is placed above the <b>driving</b> <b>axle,</b> or spread out over multiple <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> to maximize traction on each and evenly distribute its load.|$|R
