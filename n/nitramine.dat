However, the use of amine is found associated with formation of the potent harmful and stable compound group of aliphatic <b>nitramines.</b> The toxic effect of these aliphatic <b>nitramines,</b> including species of different trophic levels, must be assessed, prior to any large-scale implementation of PCC. In this present study bacterial response from acute exposure to the two <b>nitramines</b> monoethanolnitramine (MEA-NO 2) and dimethylnitramine (DMA-NO 2) have been assessed. This {{has been done by}} looking for effects in the rate of aerobic respiration by measuring the oxygen consumption using O 2 Sensor Dish®Reader system (Presens), and in community-level metabolic profiling including 31 -different ecological relevant carbon substrates using the Ecoplates™ (BIOLOG). Samples of both natural bacterial community (lake-water) and pure bacterial culture have been included in this study. The <b>nitramines</b> have been quantified using LC-MS. Results suggest MEA-NO 2 to inhibit rate of O 2 consumption in natural lake-water bacterial community at concentrations > 4 mg L- 1. No such effect was found for pure culture of Bacillus subtilis, neither from exposure to MEA-NO 2 nor to DMA-NO 2. Moreover, the two <b>nitramines</b> are found to induce slight shifts in the metabolic profile of natural lake-water bacterial communities. Challenges associated with working with highly dynamic natural bacterial communities lead to the recommendation of additional testing to be performed in order to obtain a conclusive picture of bacterial response to the <b>nitramines.</b> The levels of <b>nitramines</b> found in this study to affect bacteria are 1000 fold higher than what is currently estimated to be expected from the emissions of a PCC plant (worst-case scenario).

Fossil fuels are well known for their environmental detriments including global warming which leads to climate change. With this cause, the world has to use the fossil fuels in an environmentally friendly manner to ensure that the amount of pollutants released into the atmosphere is minimized. In combating climate change, technologies have been developed whereby the prime greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide is captured and stored.

HMX, C4H8N4(NO2)4, a <b>nitramine</b> with greater energy than ammonium perchlorate, {{was used in the}} propellant of the Peacekeeper ICBM and is the main ingredient in NEPE-75 propellant used in the Trident II D-5 Fleet Ballistic Missile. It is because of explosive hazard that the higher energy military solid propellants containing HMX are not used in commercial launch vehicles except when the LV is an adapted ballistic missile already containing HMX propellant (Minotaur IV and V based on the retired Peacekeeper ICBMs). The Naval Air Weapons Station at China Lake, California, developed a new compound, C6H6N6(NO2)6, called simply CL-20 (China Lake compound #20). Compared to HMX, CL-20 has 14% more energy per mass, 20% more energy per volume, and a higher oxygen-to-fuel ratio. One of the motivations for development of these very high energy density military solid propellants is to achieve mid-course exo-atmospheric ABM capability from missiles small enough to fit in existing ship-based below-deck vertical launch tubes and air-mobile truck-mounted launch tubes. CL-20 propellant compliant with Congress' 2004 insensitive munitions (IM) law has been demonstrated and may, as its cost comes down, be suitable for use in commercial launch vehicles, with a very significant increase in performance compared with the currently favored APCP solid propellants. With a specific impulse of 309 s already demonstrated by Peacekeeper's second stage using HMX propellant, the higher energy of CL-20 propellant can be expected to increase specific impulse to around 320 s in similar ICBM or launch vehicle upper stage applications, without the explosive hazard of HMX.|$|E

For this, available animal carcinogenicity studies with N-nitroso compounds and <b>nitramines</b> have been used to derive carcinogenic potency values, that were subsequently used to assess the predictive performance of alternative prediction approaches for these chemicals. Promising cancer prediction models are the QSARs developed by the Helguera group, in vitro transformation assays, and the in vivo initiation-promotion, and transgenic animal assays. All these models, however, have not been adequately explored for this purpose, as the number of N-nitroso compounds investigated is yet too limited, and therefore further testing with relevant N-nitroso compounds is needed...|$|R
2500|$|Other spectrally {{balanced}} payloads {{are made}} up similarly as double base propellants and contain nitrocellulose (NC), and other esters of nitric acid [...] or nitro compounds as oxidizers such as e.g. hexanitroethane and nitro compounds and <b>nitramines</b> as high energy fuels. The main advantage of the latter payloads is their low visibility due {{to the absence of}} metals such as sodium and potassium that may be either easily thermally excited and give prominent emissions or give condensed reaction products (such as carbonates and chlorides), which would cause a distinct smoke trail.|$|R
