25|$|Various {{techniques}} of <b>nanolithography</b> such as optical lithography, X-ray lithography dip pen <b>nanolithography,</b> {{electron beam lithography}} or nanoimprint lithography were also developed. Lithography is a top-down fabrication technique where a bulk material is reduced in size to nanoscale pattern.|$|E
25|$|In {{the optical}} {{frequency}} regime developing the superlens may allow for imaging below the diffraction limit. Other potential applications for negative-index metamaterials are optical <b>nanolithography,</b> nanotechnology circuitry, {{as well as}} a near field superlens (Pendry, 2000) that could be useful for biomedical imaging and subwavelength photolithography.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{use of this}} {{technique}} is to remove the SAM molecules in a process called shaving, where the atomic force microscope tip is dragged along the surface mechanically removing the molecules. An atomic force microscope can also remove SAM molecules by local oxidation <b>nanolithography.</b>|$|E
25|$|Microlithography and <b>nanolithography</b> refer {{specifically}} to lithographic patterning methods capable of structuring material on a fine scale. Typically, features smaller than 10 micrometers are considered microlithographic, and features smaller than 100 nanometers are considered nanolithographic. Photolithography {{is one of}} these methods, often applied to semiconductor manufacturing of microchips. Photolithography is also commonly used for fabricating Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. Photolithography generally uses a pre-fabricated photomask or reticle as a master from which the final pattern is derived.|$|E
25|$|Dip-pen <b>nanolithography</b> is {{a process}} that uses an atomic force {{microscope}} to transfer molecules on the tip to a substrate. Initially the tip is dipped into a reservoir with an ink. The ink on the tip evaporates and leaves the desired molecules attached to the tip. When the tip is brought into contact with the surface a water meniscus forms between the tip and the surface resulting in the diffusion of molecules from the tip to the surface. These tips can have radii in the tens of nanometers, and thus SAM molecules can be very precisely deposited onto a specific location of the surface. This process was discovered by Chad Mirkin and co-workers at Northwestern University.|$|E
25|$|Although {{photolithographic}} {{technology is}} the most commercially advanced form of <b>nanolithography,</b> other techniques are also used. Some, for example electron beam lithography, are capable of much greater patterning resolution (sometimes {{as small as a}} few nanometers). Electron beam lithography is also important commercially, primarily for its use in the manufacture of photomasks. Electron beam lithography as it is usually practiced is a form of maskless lithography, in that a mask is not required to generate the final pattern. Instead, the final pattern is created directly from a digital representation on a computer, by controlling an electron beam as it scans across a resist-coated substrate. Electron beam lithography has the disadvantage of being much slower than photolithography.|$|E
25|$|SAMs {{are also}} useful in {{depositing}} nanostructures, because each adsorbate molecule can {{be tailored to}} attract two different materials. Current techniques utilize the head to attract to a surface, like a plate of gold. The terminal group is then modified to attract a specific material like a particular nanoparticle, wire, ribbon, or other nanostructure. In this way, wherever the a SAM is patterned to a surface there will be nanostructures attached to the tail groups. One example {{is the use of}} two types of SAMs to align single wall carbon nanotubes, SWNTs. Dip pen <b>nanolithography</b> was used to pattern a 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHA)SAM {{and the rest of the}} surface was passivated with 1-octadecanethiol (ODT) SAM. The polar solvent that is carrying the SWNTs is attracted to the hydrophilic MHA; as the solvent evaporates, the SWNTs are close enough to the MHA SAM to attach to it due to Van der Waals forces. The nanotubes thus line up with the MHA-ODT boundary. Using this technique Chad Mirkin, Schatz and their co-workers were able to make complex two-dimensional shapes, a representation of a shape created is shown to the right.|$|E

In 2013, a far smaller version of the painting, entitled the Mini Lisa, was created by a Georgia Institute of Technology student named Keith Carroll.

Local oxidation <b>nanolithography</b> contributes to the nanometric precision of the device fabrication. This top-down fabrication technique allows the fabrication of a large variety of SiNWs with different shapes, from angular to circular. It also allows the precise positioning of the silicon nanowires in ant desired position, making easier its integration; indeed, this technique is compatible with the standard silicon CMOS processing technology. Single crystalline silicon nanowires have already shown a great potential as ultrasensitive sensors by detecting changes in the nanowire conductivity when a specific analyte is present.
