40|$|Abstract — The {{total power}} budget of Ultra-Low Power (ULP) VLSI Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) is often {{dominated}} by the leakage power of embedded memories and pipeline registers, which typically cannot be power-gated during sleep periods as they need to retain data and program state, respectively. On the one hand, supply voltage scaling down to the near-threshold (near-VT) or even to the sub-threshold (sub-VT) domain is a commonly used, efficient technique to reduce both leakage power and active energy dissipation. On the other hand, emerging CMOS-compatible device technologies such as Resistive Memories (ReRAMs) enable <b>non-volatile,</b> on-chip <b>data</b> storage and zero-leakage sleep periods. For the first time, we present a ReRAM-based non-volatile flipflop which is optimized for sub-VT operation. Writing to the ReRAM devices works with a CMOS-compatible supply voltage. Thanks to near-VT and sub-VT operation and {{as compared to the}} write energy, which depends on the ReRAM technology, the read consumes only 5. 4 % of the total read+write energy. Monte Carlo simulations accounting for parametric variations in both the MOS transistors and the ReRAM devices confirm reliable data restore operation from the ReRAM devices at a sub-VT voltage as low as 400 mV, and a standard deviation of up to 5 % of the nominal value of the ReRAM resistance.
