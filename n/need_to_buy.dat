5|$|Development {{was almost}} {{complete}} with only minor polishing {{to be done}} before the game was to be released in 2011. A playable demo of Duke Nukem Forever was released once Gearbox figured out the timing, with purchasers of the Game of the Year Edition of Borderlands gaining early access. The demo is unexpectedly different from the versions available at PAX and Firstlook. Those that purchased Borderlands on Valve's Steam prior to October 12, 2010 got the code for the demo without the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the Game of the Year edition of the game. Duke Nukem Forever was initially scheduled for release on May 3 in the United States and May 6 internationally and after another delay was finally released on June 14 in North America and June 10 worldwide, nearly four weeks after the game had 'gone gold' within 15 years.|$|E

25|$|At present, a retiree's {{benefit is}} {{annually}} {{adjusted for inflation}} to reflect changes in {{the consumer price index}}. Some economists argue that the consumer price index overestimates price increases in the economy and therefore is not a suitable metric for adjusting benefits, while others argue that the CPI underestimates the effect of inflation on what retired people actually <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> to live.|$|E

50|$|In most cases, {{fuel cards}} can provide fuel at a {{wholesale}} price {{as opposed to}} standard retail. This way, discount fuel can be purchased without <b>needing</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> in bulk.|$|R
25|$|The {{new system}} was {{announced}} as a touch on / touch off system, where two validations are required per journey; one when boarding and again when alighting, {{similar to the}} London Underground's Oyster card system. This means passengers would have a single card and be charged for the actual fare used (flat rate fare). This is unlike Metcard where passengers who travel into different zones at different days and times may <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> several types of Metcards beforehand.|$|E
25|$|In January 1931 the Dublin Chronicle {{promoted}} a new Irish Industries Purchasing League with a campaign advocating the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> Irish Goods, which was welcomed {{and supported by}} Irish manufacturers and retail outlets alike. Sheehan relentlessly pursued the unresoved questions of slums and housing. He then called for the early selection of suitable candidates to stand for Labour at the next (1932) general election. Publication of the Chronicle ended in August 1931 {{brought on by the}} world economic Great Depression.|$|E
25|$|In the mid 1990s {{mechanically}} incompatible higher-density floppy disks were introduced, {{like the}} Iomega Zip disk. Adoption was {{limited by the}} competition between proprietary formats and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> expensive drives for computers where the disks would be used. In some cases, failure in market penetration was exacerbated by release of higher-capacity versions of the drive and media not backward-compatible with the original drives, dividing the users between new and old adopters. Consumers wary of making costly investments into unproven and rapidly changing technologies, resulting in none of the technologies becoming an established standard.|$|E

25|$|A TMP mill was {{installed}} 1977, {{but not until}} a series of upgrades were completed in 1992 could the former grindstone production be scrapped and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> sulfite cellulose could be dropped. PM3 became operational on 23 June 1981. The machines have been through several major upgrades, the most extensive in the late 1980s and early 2000s. A deinking mill became operational in June 2000. Proposals for PM4, which would have produced magazine paper, were abandoned after the {{plans to build a}} gas-powered on-site thermal power plant were scrapped by Industrikraft Midt-Norge.|$|E
25|$|The lettermail service {{allows the}} {{transmission}} of virtually any paper document. The 2015 and 2016 rate was 85 cents for a standard letter (30 g or less) and $1.20 for a letter between 30 g and 50 g. Rates usually increase in mid-January of each year (in 2014 the increase was delayed {{to the end of}} March); for ordinary letters (30 g or less), the 2014 rate was originally scheduled to be $0.65. The rate was regulated by a price-cap formula, linked to the inflation rate. The Corporation now has a “permanent” stamp that is valued at the domestic rate forever, eliminating the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> 1 cent stamps after a rate increase. The rates for lettermail are based on weight and size and determine whether the article falls into the aforementioned standard format or in the oversize one.|$|E
25|$|Roast Beef's {{birthday}} is April 22. Some of his accomplishments include {{a program that}} determines how many eggs and how much milk you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> in a given week, and another that determines the amount of loose change lying around your house and makes a reservation at a restaurant accordingly. Roast Beef is partial to UNIX and his preferred programming language is Java. He likes Stella Artois beer and Guinness. He is perhaps the world's greatest historian of the Great Outdoor Fight, and drove Ray to compete (and win) in the 2006 Fight. He also managed {{to get into the}} Fight himself by hacking the Fight's database. He fully accepted the fact that Ray would have to beat him senseless in order to win, and was shocked beyond belief when Ray destroyed the Fight rather than fight him. He drives a 1965 Ford Galaxie (powered by Ford's rare 427 SOHC V8 engine) that was a gift from Ray. He has also gone to the moon, by stealing Pat's home-made rocket, and to the afterlife (both heaven and hell), via various methods including some of the aforementioned shooting incidents and vomiting into an electrical outlet. He has also produced his very own zine, titled Man Why You Even Got To Do A Thing.|$|E
50|$|On 28 November 2011, the {{integration}} process was completed {{and for the}} first time, passengers from the Kelana Jaya Line could transfer onto the Ampang and Sri Petaling Lines and vice versa without <b>needing</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> new tickets.|$|R
25|$|Membership of a co-op is {{typically}} obtained by buying shares {{on the open}} market, most often through a real estate agent. No board approval is <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> shares.

25|$|When the Glass House estate {{first opened}} for public tours in 2007, tickets sold out quickly. By July 2010, 15,000 {{visitors}} {{had taken the}} tour. The number of tours has been limited, and visitors initially <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> tickets months in advance.|$|R
500|$|In his {{introduction}} {{in the documentary}} film, It Might Get Loud, Jack showcases his minimalist style and ingenuity by constructing a rudimentary guitar in a pastoral setting. The [...] "guitar" [...] was built out of a plank of wood, two nails, a glass Coke bottle, a guitar string, and a pickup. He ends the demonstration with the memorable quote, [...] "Who says you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a guitar?" ...|$|E
500|$|Hillary Goldstein of IGN {{praised the}} comic book, {{saying that it}} [...] "is truly {{the cream of the}} crop when it comes to Vertigo books. Neil Gaiman's work on the series is {{considered}} legendary for a reason. This story, in its entirety, is every bit as good as Watchmen and of equal (if not greater) literary merit. Were I to list the 100 best single comic-book issues I have ever read, three would come from this collection. Whether you have read The Sandman before or are a first timer, this is the one book you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> this fall. The stories within are magnificent and the care taken in reproducing Gaiman's work is the same you'd expect for any great work of literature." ...|$|E
500|$|Under the Selborne plan of 1902, the Royal Navy {{intended}} to start three new battleships and four armoured cruisers each year. However, in late 1904 {{it became clear}} that the 1905–06 programme would have to be considerably smaller, because of lower than expected tax revenue and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> out two Chilean battleships under construction in British yards, lest they be purchased by the Russians for use against the Japanese, Britain's ally. These economies meant that the 1905–06 programme consisted only of one battleship, but three armoured cruisers. The battleship became the revolutionary battleship , and the cruisers became the three ships of the [...] Fisher later claimed, however, that he had argued during the Committee for the cancellation of the remaining battleship.|$|E
50|$|The Roman Baths Museum {{launched}} a campaign {{to raise the money}} <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the hoard. The museum's bid was supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund and it was intended that a full catalogue of the finds would be published during 2013.|$|R

500|$|Leng, {{the first}} author to write purely on Harrison's career rather than on his {{standing}} as a musical celebrity, considers Dark Horse to be a [...] "remarkably revealing album" [...] and writes: [...] "Any voyeur who {{wanted to know the}} intimate details of his personal life didn't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> National Enquirer, they just needed to hear this disc." [...] While bemoaning the state of Harrison's voice and the [...] "sonic patchwork" [...] nature of the set, Leng notes that both [...] "So Sad" [...] and [...] "Far East Man" [...] were received positively when first released on albums by Alvin Lee & Mylon LeFevre and Ron Wood, respectively. The difference in winter 1974–75, Leng continues, was that, by championing Ravi Shankar's Indian music segments during the tour and neglecting his duties as an ex-Beatle in America, Harrison had [...] "committed the cardinal counterculture sin – he had rejected 'rock 'n' roll'".|$|E
500|$|After {{the notice}} was reactivated, {{detailed}} planning recommenced (essentially from scratch). Changes {{made to the}} organisation of the force approved ten years earlier were only minor. After many years of notice, there was still skepticism that the deployment would ever occur. The government and army were cautious {{about the timing of}} the commitment of funds; significant funding was only released in late 1988, a few months before deployment. The squadron's equipment deficiencies were valued at $16million, and there was a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> $700,000 of equipment immediately. The UN initially estimated the cost of the entire operation at $US1billion, equivalent to its own budget. The reluctance to commit funds ultimately reduced training of the deployed forces; Senator Jo Vallentine said in Parliament that the Namibia operation nearly fell apart {{due to a lack of}} advance funding, and Senator Jocelyn Newman called it disgraceful. The UN General Assembly did not approve the UNTAG budget until 1 March 1989, less than two weeks before the advance party deployed and after the deployment of the start-up team. Gration authorised Operation Picaresque on 3 March 1989. In addition to a lack of funds, there was little intelligence on Namibia; the region was [...] "generally unknown to the Australian public, the policy-makers and to the troops and civilians who deployed there".|$|E

Finance includes the need to transfer money without coming under the suspicion of financial security organizations.|$|E
50|$|The £5,000 <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a {{lifeboat}} {{was one of}} {{the targets}} of the Guide Gift Week appeal of 1940. Money was donated by Guides throughout the British Empire from their salaries or, for those too young to work, by earning money doing odd jobs.|$|R

50|$|A Working Group {{was formed}} in 1962 to attempt to set a poverty line for India. This Working Group used {{calories}} required for survival, and income <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> those calories {{in different parts of}} rural India, to derive an average poverty line of Rs. 20 per month at 1960-61 prices.|$|R

The government violently suppressed the protests, killing 100 children and teenagers. Bokassa himself may have been personally involved in some of the killings. In September 1979, France overthrew Bokassa and [...] "restored" [...] Dacko to power (subsequently restoring the name of the country to the Central African Republic). Dacko, in turn, was again overthrown in a coup by General André Kolingba on 1 September 1981.|$|E
2500|$|A virtual economy (or {{sometimes}} synthetic economy) is an emergent economy {{existing in}} a virtual world, usually exchanging virtual goods {{in the context of}} an Internet game. People enter these virtual economies for recreation and entertainment rather than necessity, which means that virtual economies lack the aspects of a real economy that are not considered to be [...] "fun" [...] (for instance, avatars {{in a virtual}} economy often do not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> food in order to survive, and usually do not have any biological needs at all). However, some people do interact with virtual economies for [...] "real" [...] economic benefit.|$|E

25|$|In the Philippines, a tenant-owner's {{association}} {{is often used}} as a means <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> new flats. When the cooperative is created, it takes the {{major part of the}} loan <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the property. These loans will then be paid off during a fixed periods of years (typically 20-30), and once this is done, the cooperative is dispersed and the flats are transformed into condominiums.|$|R
