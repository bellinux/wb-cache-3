The second-generation display was announced in 2013. This is a planar Head-Up Display (HUD) with hundreds of thousands voxels and freeform images floating in mid-air that can change in real time. Interactivity is added with a Kinect motion sensor that allows you to 'touch' icons in free space and 'draw' in mid-air. The third generation display builds upon the previous generations to create a volumetric display. The images are bright and visible under indoor lighting conditions, and the approach is scalable, leveraging existing manufacturing techniques and components.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} impact of <b>numeric</b> risk <b>information</b> about false {{negative}} (FN) and false positive (FP) rates in faecal occult blood testing (FOBt) on attitudes towards screening. Methods: 95 people aged 45 – 59, living in England, read 6 hypothetical vignettes presented online about the use of FOB testing to detect bowel cancer, in which information about FN and FP rates was systematically varied. Results: Both verbal and <b>numeric</b> FN risk <b>information</b> reduced people's interest in screening compared with no FN <b>information.</b> <b>Numeric</b> FN risk <b>information</b> reduced people's perceptions of screening effectiveness and lowered perceived trust in the results of screening compared with both verbal FN information and no FN information. FP information did not affect attitudes towards FOB testing. There was limited evidence that FN information reduced interest and perceptions of screening effectiveness more in educated groups. Conclusion: <b>Numeric</b> FN risk <b>information</b> decreased people's perceptions of screening effectiveness and trust in the results of screening but did not affect people's interest in screening anymore than verbal FN risk <b>information.</b> Practice Implications <b>Numeric</b> FN <b>information</b> could be added to patient information without affecting interest in screening, although this needs to be replicated in a larger, more representative sample...|$|R

Making the matter even more complex, the Inca 'kept separate [...] "khipu" [...] for each province, on which a pendant string recorded the number of people belonging to each category.' [...] This creates yet another step in the process of decryption in addition to the Spanish attempts at eradicating the system.

Two French Kit numeracy tasks (the addition, and the addition and subtraction correction tasks) constituted objective measures of numeracy, and the numeracy component of a health literacy instrument (The Short Test of Functional Health Literacy for Adults [S-TOFHLA]) constituted the health numeracy measure. We measured math self-efficacy using the Mathematics Self-Efficacy Scale (MSES) and the Subjective Numeracy Scale (SNS). All measures were presented in English. Kikuyu speakers had lower math self-efficacy (p <. 05) compared with Mandarin speakers (p <. 05).
