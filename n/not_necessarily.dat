Some steel cylinders manufactured to US standards are permitted to exceed the nominal working pressure by 10% and this is indicated by a '+' symbol. This extra pressure allowance is dependent on the cylinder passing the appropriate periodical hydrostatic test and is <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> valid for US cylinders exported to countries with differing standards. The nominal gas content of these cylinders is based on the 10% higher pressure.|$|E

40|$|Crisis {{situations}} {{would seem}} to be a particularly good test of this mirror notion. Crises by definitions involve an actual or potetial major disruption of ongoing routines and are indicators that there has been interference by accident or design of regular social activities (Stallings, 1970). Of equal importance, they necessitate some collective response (Quarantelli, Weller and Wenger, forthcoming). From that very fact they are <b>not</b> only <b>necessarily</b> attention from that very fact they are <b>not</b> only <b>necessarily</b> attention getting but it would seem they should require some response by the local mass comnnmication system...|$|R
