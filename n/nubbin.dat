500|$|The season's {{visual effects}} were {{produced}} by Anthem Visual Effects, with the company's Lee Wilson serving as co-producer and visual effects supervisor. Because it was filmed in green screen, each episode contains an estimated 400 visual effect shots. In contrast, an average episode of Stargate SG-1, which Tapping starred in, contained only 12. One {{of the larger}} visual effects sequences was the opening sequence of the premiere, which took three months to produce. Each visual effect produced in the original webisodes was remastered. Among the characters, the movement of two-faced guy's rear face were made with Computer-generated imagery (CGI), {{though it was a}} difficult effect to produce. A prosthetic application was added to the back of Campbell's head when the second face is not talking. The mermaid character, Sally, was entirely a visual effect, with the face of Mandy May, wife of director Steven A. Adelson, rendered onto it. Creating the eponymous abnormals in [...] "Nubbins" [...] and their predator was what Sam Egan described as [...] "a proper budget-driven issue" [...] because rendering several CGI creatures at once and having them move would be difficult. It was decided to have them camouflaged in an attempt to make work easier for the visual effects team, but it did not work out as well as the producers hoped. To achieve <b>Nubbin</b> interaction with the cast, guide versions, nicknamed Oompa-Loompas, were made for them to carry. In designing Tesla's transition to a vampire, the producers, realizing vampires were included in several other works in the past, wanted to make them look unique. Wilson based the vampire look to the 2007 film 30 Days of Night.|$|E

The increase in NP at BR in the high pCO 2 treatments may have increased calcification and thus masked the negative effect of low Omega Arag on calcification.

40|$|This {{study has}} {{examined}} the effect of an increased seawater pCO 2 on the rates of photosynthesis and carbon translocation in the scleractinian coral species Stylophora pistillata using a new model based on 13 C-labelling of the photosynthetic products. Symbiont photosynthesis contributes for {{a large part of}} the carbon acquisition in tropical coral species and is therefore an important process that may determine their survival under climate change scenarios. <b>Nubbins</b> of S. pistillata were maintained for six months under two pHs (8. 1 and 7. 2). Rates of photosynthesis and respiration of the symbiotic association and of isolated symbionts were assessed at each pH. The fate of 13 C-photosynthates was then followed in the symbionts and the coral host for 48 h. <b>Nubbins</b> maintained at pH 7. 2 presented a lower areal symbiont concentration, lower areal rates of gross photosynthesis, and lower carbon incorporation rates compared to <b>nubbins</b> maintained at pH 8. 1, therefore suggesting that the total carbon acquisition was lower in this first set of <b>nubbins.</b> However, the total percentage of carbon translocated to the host, as well as the amount of carbon translocated per symbiont cell was significantly higher under pH 7. 2 than under pH 8. 1 (70 % at pH 7. 2 versus 60 % at pH 8. 1), so that the total amount of photosynthetic carbon received by the coral host was equivalent under both pHs (5. 5 to 6. 1 &mu;g C cm&minus; 2 h&minus; 1 ). Although the carbon budget of the host was unchanged, symbionts acquired less carbon for their own needs (0. 6 against 1. 8 &mu;g C cm&minus; 2 h&minus; 1 ), explaining the overall decrease in symbiont concentration at low pH.

40|$|International audienceWhile {{the role}} of microboring organisms, or euendoliths, is {{relatively}} well known in dead coral skeletons, their function in live corals remains poorly understood. They are suggested to behave like ectosymbionts or parasites, impacting their host health. However, the species composition of microboring communities, their abundance and dynamics in live corals under various environmental conditions have never been explored. Here, the effect of phosphate enrichment on boring microorganisms in live corals was tested for the first time. S. pistillata <b>nubbins</b> were exposed to 3 different treatments (phosphate enrichments of 0, 0. 5 and 2. 5 μmol l- 1) during 15 weeks. After 15 weeks of phosphate enrichment, petrographic thin sections were prepared for observation with light microscopy, and additional samples were examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Euendoliths comprised mainly autotrophic Ostreobium sp. filaments. Rare filaments of heterotrophic fungi were also observed. Filaments were densely distributed in {{the central part of}} <b>nubbins,</b> and less abundant towards the apex. Unexpectedly, there was a visible reduction of filaments abundance in the most recently-calcified apical part of phosphate-enriched <b>nubbins.</b> The overall abundance of euendoliths significantly decreased, from 9. 12 ± 1. 09 % of the skeletal surface area in unenriched corals, to 5. 81 ± 0. 77 % and 5. 27 ± 0. 34 % in 0. 5 and 2. 5 μmol l- 1 -phosphate enriched corals respectively. SEM observations confirmed this decrease. Recent studies have shown that phosphate enrichment increases coral skeletal growth and metabolic rates, while it decreases skeletal density and resilience to mechanical stress. We thus hypothesize that increased skeletal growth in the presence of phosphate enrichment occurred too fast for an effective euendolith colonization. They could not keep up with coral growth, so they became diluted in the apex areas as <b>nubbins</b> grew with phosphate enrichment. The possible advantages and downsides of the reduction of euendoliths associated with phosphate eutrophication in live corals are discussed in this article...|$|R

Percentage of coral cover indicated reduced habitat suitability with depth and at the Tanjung Husi (TA) site, which also displayed relatively higher seawater temperatures. Expression of the P. verrucosa hsp 70 transcript evaluated under field conditions followed a depth-related profile, with relatively higher expression levels in 3 -m collected <b>nubbins</b> compared to the 12 -m ones.
