5|$|So much {{controversy}} has swirled around my career this past decade that very little attention ever gets paid to my music. The songs {{are all but}} forgotten. While I have <b>no</b> <b>regrets</b> regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to appreciate {{the idea of doing}} things in a simpler way. So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{was delighted}} with his team's win and {{credited}} his opponent's performance. He felt the brawl in stoppage time was {{born out of}} Arsenal's frustration after going behind in the match; he did not want either team to be punished. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger apologised for his players' conduct and said he had <b>no</b> <b>regrets</b> over his team selection. Both finalists were fined £100,000 each by The Football Association for their inability to control their players. Emmanuel Eboué was retrospectively banned for three matches as his punch on Wayne Bridge was missed by Howard Webb. Wenger was later found guilty of improper conduct and charged £2,500 for his comments about the linesman.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Kurosawa, {{influenced}} by the democratic ideals of the Occupation, sought to make films that would establish a new respect towards {{the individual and the}} self. The first such film, <b>No</b> <b>Regrets</b> for Our Youth (1946), inspired by both the 1933 Takigawa incident and the Hotsumi Ozaki wartime spy case, criticized Japan's prewar regime for its political oppression. Atypically for the director, the heroic central character is a woman, Yukie (Setsuko Hara), who born into upper-middle-class privilege, comes to question her values in a time of political crisis. The original script had to be extensively rewritten and, because of its controversial theme (and because the protagonist was a woman), the completed work divided critics, but it nevertheless managed to win the approval of audiences, who turned variations on the film's title into a postwar catchphrase.|$|E
50|$|<b>No</b> <b>Regret</b> was {{developed}} {{on a tight}} schedule, so director Tony Zurovec could not implement all the improvements {{he had in mind}} for the sequel to No Remorse. As such he does not consider it a true sequel to that game. A working title of Crusader: <b>No</b> <b>Regret</b> was <b>No</b> Quarter and Origin management also wanted to release it as Crusader II: <b>No</b> <b>Regret</b> (the numeral was removed per Zurovec's wishes). A cancelled multiplayer expansion was to be titled Crusader: No Survivors.|$|R

50|$|<b>No</b> <b>Regret</b> is Japanese singer-songwriter Kumi Koda's eighth {{single in}} her 12 Singles Collection and twenty-sixth overall. It managed to peak at #4 on the Oricon Singles Charts and {{remained}} on the charts for twelve weeks. Unlike {{most of the other}} singles in the collection, <b>No</b> <b>Regret</b> was not limited to 50,000 copies. This was only done with two other singles in the collection: you and Someday/Boys♥Girls. <b>No</b> <b>Regret</b> sold 72,081 copies within the first week and, as more recent figures show, it has sold a total of 131,348 copies.|$|R
5|$|On 1 March, Jesé {{returned}} to the Santiago Bernabéu {{for the first time}} ahead of Las Palmas' La Liga encounter with Real Madrid. During the build-up to the match, he revealed that he owed a debt to Real Madrid for welcoming him at the club and blamed the cruciate ligament injury he suffered as the reason for him not becoming a star with them. He also defended his previous criticism of former manager José Mourinho, stating that he has <b>no</b> <b>regrets</b> over his actions. Jesé started in the match between the two sides which ultimately ended in a 3–3 draw. He scored his first goals for the club four days later, netting a brace in a 5−2 league win over Osasuna. The result was Jesé's first win with Las Palmas, after the club failed to record a victory in its previous five matches following his arrival. He ultimately made 16 appearances for the campaign, scoring three goals and registering an assist as the side dropped to end the season in fourteenth position. Upon the conclusion of Jesé's loan agreement, Las Palmas elected not to attempt to sign him permanently, with his poor overall performance, high salary demands and off-field behaviour ultimately contributing to the club's decision.|$|E
5|$|Takanohana finally {{returned}} to the ring in September 2002, after the Sumo Association declared he must compete or retire. He finished behind Musashimaru on 12–3, the 16th time {{he had been a}} tournament runner-up. Considering how long he had been away, it was seen as an impressive comeback. However, he sat out the next tournament with a recurrence of the knee injury. He made another comeback in January 2003, making a late decision to compete. A shoulder injury caused him to miss two days, and after suffering successive losses to Dejima and Aminishiki he announced his retirement. He said he had <b>no</b> <b>regrets</b> and was thankful to have achieved so much in sumo. His father spoke of his relief at the decision, after seeing his son battle through so many injuries. Takanohana's record of 22 tournament championships was the fourth best in sumo history, behind only Taihō, Chiyonofuji and Kitanoumi at the time. Junichiro Koizumi, the Prime Minister, was among those paying tribute. His retirement left no Japanese born wrestlers at the yokozuna rank and was widely regarded as being the end of an era.|$|E

25|$|Tiffany {{posed for}} the April 2002 issue of Playboy, which {{became one of}} the highest-selling issues of all time. Tiffany stated in {{interviews}} that she had to explain to her then-nine-year-old son that it was no different than posing in Vogue or Elle, except that it showed more. She added years later that while she had <b>no</b> <b>regrets</b> posing in Playboy, she had family members who weren't too happy with her because of how young her son was at the time.|$|E
50|$|<b>No</b> <b>Regret</b> added {{several new}} weapons and death animations, {{including}} freezing (and subsequent shattering) and two {{different kinds of}} melting. In No Remorse, the Silencer could carry {{no more than five}} firearms at once; in <b>No</b> <b>Regret,</b> this restriction was lifted entirely. Nonplayer characters no longer carry money, since there are no friendly merchants to deal with on the Moon.|$|R

25|$|When Leykis's show {{went off}} the air in 2009, {{he was in the}} middle of a five-year {{contract}} with CBS. This contract included the rights to his show over terrestrial radio, internet rights, and specific to airing on KLSX; this kept Leykis from appearing on any other CBS station. In addition, CBS also would not allow podcasts for them, as they were concentrating on other online ventures at the time. Despite all this, Leykis has <b>no</b> <b>regrets</b> over his contract terms, and still speaks highly of CBS.|$|E
25|$|Early on 24 October, a Russian made F1 grenade was detonated in the Mwauras disco in Kenya's capital Nairobi. The {{detonation}} injured 14 people. The {{local police}} linked the attack to Al-Shabaab. It {{was followed by}} a second attack that evening against a bus stop. The second attacked killed at least one person and injured eight. A suspect was arrested and pleaded guilty for both attacks. He said that {{he is a member of}} Al-Shabaab. Identified by the media as Elgiva Bwire Oliacha (alias Mohamed Seif), a recent Kenyan Muslim convert, he was sentenced to life in prison after having pleaded guilty. The man reportedly smiled at cameras, stated that he harboured <b>no</b> <b>regrets,</b> and indicated that he would not appeal his sentence.|$|E
25|$|On {{the romantic}} front, he dated newly {{divorced}} Ginger Rogers. The romance soon cooled, however, and by chance Stewart encountered Margaret Sullavan again. Stewart found his footing in Hollywood {{thanks largely to}} Sullavan, who campaigned for Stewart to be her leading man in the 1936 romantic comedy Next Time We Love. She rehearsed extensively with him, having a noticeable effect on his confidence. She encouraged Stewart to feel comfortable with his unique mannerisms and boyish charm and use them naturally as his own style. Stewart was enjoying Hollywood life and had <b>no</b> <b>regrets</b> about giving up the stage, as he worked {{six days a week}} in the MGM factory. In 1936, he acquired big-time agent Leland Hayward, who would eventually marry Sullavan. Hayward started to chart Stewart's career, deciding that the best path for him was through loan-outs to other studios.|$|E

5000|$|<b>No</b> <b>Regret</b> (...) is a 2006 South Korean {{film and}} the feature film directorial debut of Leesong Hee-il, {{based on his}} earlier short Good Romance. <b>No</b> <b>Regret</b> is also {{regarded}} as [...] "the first 'real' Korean gay feature", (although earlier South Korean films, such as Road Movie, released in 2002, have dealt with gay relationships), and is also the first South Korean feature to be directed by an openly gay Korean filmmaker.|$|R
5000|$|Adam Hartzell of Koreanfilm.org found <b>No</b> <b>Regret</b> {{to have an}} [...] "engaging story" [...] {{and praised}} the depth given to the characters, saying, [...] "One of the best aspects of this film is how we aren't {{provided}} the obligatory caricatures of gay 'types' on prime-time sitcoms in the United States...

25|$|Upon waking, the Doctor {{traces the}} psychic signal linking their dreams back to Clara {{and is able}} to pull the crab off, only to learn that Clara is now an elderly woman. Sixty-two years have {{apparently}} elapsed since they last met. As they become reacquainted, the Doctor expresses regret over not coming back for her sooner. Suddenly, Santa appears and encourages the Doctor to act before it is too late. The Doctor, realizing he is still dreaming, wakes up for real and rushes to the real Clara. He frees her from the crab to find, to their mutual relief, that she is still a young adult. Wanting <b>no</b> <b>regrets</b> and offering her all of time and space, the Doctor implores Clara to join him again. Clara happily accepts. As the pair depart, they are unaware of a tangerine having been left on Clara's windowsill.|$|E
25|$|The {{first day}} of July saw Blerim Džemaili, whose {{ownership}} had just been resolved in favour of Parma, move to Napoli in a €9 million deal which saw the Swiss international move south {{in exchange for the}} permanent transfer of experienced midfielder Manuele Blasi and the loan of Italian-Brazilian defender Fabiano Santacroce. The following day saw Parma complete a triple swoop of strikers, as Graziano Pellè, Fabio Borini and Nicola Sansone all arrived on 2 July. Pellè was signed from Dutch side AZ Alkmaar for around €1.5 million after long-term interest, while Sansone was brought in on a free transfer from German giants Bayern Munich. Parma also signed young Italian Fabio Borini from Premier League giants Chelsea after a lengthy pursuit. He had been on loan to Swansea City for {{the latter part of the}} previous season, but Parma had been tracking Borini for some months and Borini confirmed he had <b>no</b> <b>regrets</b> over the move, despite Swansea's disappointment.|$|E
25|$|Shields also {{expressed}} {{frustration with the}} media's pressure for immediate answers and a rapid arrest, and their insinuations that the death was an inside job by someone from the Pakistani team, speculation which Shields rejected. Shields turned to his old Scotland Yard colleagues for assistance; they sent a team of their own to offer aid and a fresh perspective on the investigation. The following month, their investigation reached a startlingly different result: they stated that Woolmer {{had died of a}} heart attack. Faced with the contradictory result, Shields became the target of criticism from colleagues, but stated he had <b>no</b> <b>regrets</b> and rejected calls to step down. In late November, after 26 days of testimony from 57 witnesses, the 11-member jury convened to conduct the inquest into Woolmer's death concluded that there was insufficient evidence to return a verdict on its cause. Shields then announced that the JCF did not intend to pursue further investigation.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{relation}} between notions of game-theoretic equilibria {{which are based on}} stability under a set of deviations, and empirical equilibria which are reached by rational players. Rational players are modeled by players using <b>no</b> <b>regret</b> algorithms, which guarantee that their payoff in the long run is close to the maximum they could hope to achieve by consistently deviating from the algorithm’s suggested action. We show that for a given set of deviations over the strategy set of a player, it is possible to efficiently approximate fixed points of a given deviation if and only if there exist efficient <b>no</b> <b>regret</b> algorithms resistant to the deviations. Further, we show that if all players use a <b>no</b> <b>regret</b> algorithm, then the empirical distribution of their plays converges to an equilibrium. ...|$|R
