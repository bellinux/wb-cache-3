40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of dietary inclusion of Atlantic snow crab, Chionoecetes opilio (Crab) and <b>Northern</b> <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Pandalis borealis (Shrimp) by-product meals on nutrient digestibility in haddock, Melanogrammus aeglefinus. The study provides coefficients of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTADs) essential for diet formulations aimed at further growth performance and nutrient utilization studies with gadoids using these waste streams as potential replacements for high-cost fish meals and poorly digestible wheat by-products. Organic matter (OM) CTTAD was significantly improved (P= 0. 005) with Shrimp 150 (0. 82) relative to the Control (0. 79), while Shrimp 300 was similar (0. 79) (P= 1. 000). No significant difference in OM CTTAD was found between the Control and Crab 150 (P= 0. 110), Shrimp 150 (P= 0. 473) or Shrimp 300 (P= 0. 144) at an average of 0. 80. However, OM CTTAD was significantly reduced (P< 0. 001) for Crab 300 (0. 76). Inclusion of Shrimp at 150 g/kg significantly improved (P= 0. 003) gross energy (GE) CTTAD (0. 85 on average) relative to the Control (0. 83), while Crab 150 (P= 0. 081), Crab 300 (P= 0. 134) and Shrimp 300 (P= 0. 986) were statistically equal to the Control (average, 0. 82). Crude protein (CP) CTTAD of Crab 150 (P= 0. 803) and Shrimp 150 (P= 0. 980) were similar to the Control at an average of 0. 90 while Crab 300 (P< 0. 001) and Shrimp 300 (P= 0. 005) were significantly reduced (average 0. 86). Dietary inclusion of either Atlantic snow crab or <b>Northern</b> <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> processing by-product meal at 150 g/kg, concomitant with a 50 % reduction in wheat middlings and 10 % reduction in fish meal, resulted in OM, GE and CP CTTADs equal to or exceeding that of the fish meal-based Control diet.

40|$|Fisheries and {{aquaculture}} are impacted sporadically by newly emerged viral diseases. In most cases, {{searches for}} a causative pathogen only occur after a serious disease has emerged. As random shotgun sequencing (metagenomics) offers opportunities to identify novel viruses preemptively, the method was tested on nucleic acids {{extracted from the}} hepatopancreas of 12 healthy <b>northern</b> <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> Farfantepenaeus duorarum captured from the Gulf of Mexico. Among the sequences, a nodavirus (Farfantepenaeus duorarum nodavirus, FdNV) and a virus with similarities to circoviruses and cycloviruses that possess circular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes, were identified. The FdNV genome sequence was most closely related phylogenetically to nodaviruses causing white tail disease in Macrobrachium rosenbergii and muscle necrosis disease in Litopenaeus vannamei. While the circular ssDNA virus represents the third to be detected in association with a marine invertebrate, transmission trials are needed to confirm its infectivity for F. duorarum. This study highlights the potential for using metagenomic approaches in fisheries and aquaculture industries to identify new potential pathogens in asymptomatic marine invertebrates, uncharacterized pathogens causing a new disease, or multiple pathogens associated with disease syndromes...|$|E

40|$|The California Fish and Game Commission (Commission) has the {{authority}} to require one or any combination of Bycatch Reduction Device (BRD) types in the trawl fishery within California waters for Pacific ocean shrimp (Pandalus jordani), most commonly referred to as <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp.</b> The purpose of this report is to provide the Commission with the best available information about the BRDs used in the <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> trawl fishery. The mandatory requirement for BRDs occurred in California in 2002, and in Oregon and Washington in 2003, resulting from an effort to minimize bycatch of overfished and quota managed groundfish species. Three types of BRDs currently satisfy the requirement for this device in the California fishery: 1) the Nordmøre grate (rigid-grate excluder); 2) soft-panel excluder; and 3) fisheye excluder; however, the design, specifications, and efficacy differ by BRD type. Although no data has been collected on BRDs directly from the California <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery, extensive research on the efficacy and differences among BRD types has been conducted by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) since the mid- 1990 s. Rigid-grate excluders are widely considered to be the most effective of the three BRD types at reducing groundfish bycatch. Over 90 percent of the Oregon <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> fleet use rigid-grate excluders. The majority of the current California <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> fleet also uses rigid-grate excluders, according to a telephone survey conducted by the California Department of Fish and Game (Department) in 2007 - 2008 of <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishermen who have been active in the California fishery in recent years. Hinged rigid-grate excluders have been developed in recent years to reduce the bending of the BRD on vessels that employ net reels to stow and deploy their trawl nets, and they have been used successfully on both single- and double-rig vessels in Oregon. Soft-panel excluders have been demonstrated to be effective at reducing groundfish bycatch, although excessive shrimp loss and other problems have also been associated with this design. Fisheye excluders have been used in the California fishery in the past, but they were disapproved in Oregon and Washington in 2003 because they were found to be less effective at reducing groundfish bycatch than other designs. The reputation of the United States west coast <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery as one of the cleanest shrimp fisheries in the world is largely attributed to the effectiveness of BRDs at reducing groundfish bycatch. Nevertheless, BRD research and development is still a relatively new field and additional modifications and methods may further reduce bycatch rates in the <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery.

40|$|The Patos Lagoon estuary is an {{important}} environment for {{the life cycle of}} many species, including the <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> Farfantepenaeus paulensis. This area acts as a nursery ground for the shrimp larvae, which are spawned in a coastal area and transported into the lagoon during spring and early summer (September to December). Harvesting of shrimp occurs from January to May, and yields have varied from around 1, 000 to 8, 000 tons year− 1. This study is based on analysis of river discharge, <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> catches, and wind velocity time series from 1964 to 2004. Negative correlation between <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> catches and river runoff reflects the influence of discharge on the lagoon circulation and, consequently, on the intrusion of salt water and larvae. When river discharge is below average, landward currents forced by SW winds can enhance larval transport into the estuarine area, leading to an increase in <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> captures. Above average river input would force a seaward flow that works as a barrier to ingress of larvae. This is unusual when compared to many other estuarine systems, and the main factor that accounts for this behavior is the morphology (choking) of Patos Lagoon. Interannual variability related to El Niño/Southern Oscillation events also influence <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> production in this area. Low/high shrimp catches are related to El Niño(flood) /La Niña (drought) events. Wind can also impact production through its effect on the southward displacement of larvae from the spawning area.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the presence of}} an active laccase-like enzyme from deepwater <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Parapenaeus longirostris) using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This enzyme was found in all anatomical parts of the deepwater <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp,</b> but particularly in the cephalothorax, and became active during the course of storage. Gel staining with laccase-specific substrates such as ADA, DMP and DAB was used to characterize a protein of around 44 kDa as containing laccase activity. The enzyme was inhibited by a specific inhibitor, CTAB. 4 -Hexylresorcinol, a specific inhibitor of polyphenoloxidase (PPO), did not inhibit the laccase-like enzyme. Low concentrations of antioxidants ascorbic acid or sodium metabisulphite were sufficient to inhibit the laccase-like enzyme. ABTS and DMP were subsequently used to characterize the enzyme.

Indole levels {{have been used to}} confirm the sensory evaluation of shrimp decomposition and a limit of 250 μg/kg has been used in several countries to differentiate passable shrimp from shrimp in the first stage of decomposition. No data exist on indole levels in this species and taking into account that a considerable amount of the catches are exported as fresh to Spain, it was necessary to evaluate the indole production in order to identify the usefulness of this index as an indicator of temperature abuse in this species. Biochemical, physicochemical, microbiological and sensory changes were evaluated in fresh deepwater <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> stored at 2 °C and at room temperature (22 °C). Cooked deepwater <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> chill-stored was studied too. The results indicated that indole was produced at levels of 167 μg/kg when raw shrimp was chill-stored for 7 days, while levels around 7400 μg/kg were produced after 32 h in raw shrimp stored at room temperature. Indole production of deepwater <b>pink</b> <b>shrimps,</b> showed a close parallel with microbiology data, mainly with Enterobacteriaceae production.

This paper reports {{the presence of}} hemocyanin with diphenoloxidase activity in deepwater <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Parapenaeus longirostris) post mortem. Polyacrylamide gels and specific inhibitors and substrates of mono- and diphenoloxidases were used for purposes of recognition, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for identification. Presumptive polyphenoloxidase was found in an inactive form in cephalothorax following capture, subsequently becoming active during storage. Also {{in the course of}} storage, hemocyanin acquired the ability to oxidize diphenols. Ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulphite and tropolone inhibited the prooxidant activity of both presumptive polyphenoloxidase and hemocyanin in the gels. 4 -Hexylresorcinol did not avoid the appearance of activity bands in the gel corresponding with hemocyanin, maybe because 4 -hexylresorcinol is described as slow-binding inhibitor. The acquired prooxidant activity of hemocyanin following capture is especially important because of the rapid development of melanosis in deepwater <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> during storage. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> Penaeus duorarum spawns from 25 to 60 m, {{mostly in}} summer (October to June). Size at first sexual {{maturity}} is 31 mm (carapace length). The observed difference with the Caribbean <b>pink</b> <b>shrimp</b> is analysed. Immature shrimps migrate {{all year round}} but a peak migration occurs from January to March (in summer) and is associated with maximum salinities. A secondary peak migration occurs in October corresponding to minimum salinity and maximum river discharge. The action of salinity on migration is discussed and a preponderant action of currents in the process is also suggested. Migration is also related to moon phase, tide and day-night cycles. Migration intensity as expressed by catch per unit of effort is maximum at night, during ebb tide, on new and full moon. Seasonal variation of mean migration size and abundance are related by a negative linear correlation on a logarithmic plot (R = 0. 776). This phenomenon is perhaps related to competition for food. ...|$|R
