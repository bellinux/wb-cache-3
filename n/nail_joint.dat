30|$|In an experiment, nailed boards {{were exposed}} {{outdoors}} at four sites in Japan for 7 years (2004 – 2011), and the <b>nail</b> <b>joint</b> properties were evaluated [8, 9]. The relationships between <b>nail</b> <b>joint</b> properties owing to water soaking and those owing to outdoor exposure were then compared and analyzed.|$|E
30|$|To develop at optimum {{accelerated}} aging test, {{it is very}} important to ascertain the effects of water-soaking temperature and time on <b>nail</b> <b>joint</b> properties. The purpose of this study is to reveal the effects and existence of the lower limit. Moreover, the relationships between <b>nail</b> <b>joint</b> properties and basic properties are shown.|$|E
30|$|The {{soaking time}} to reach the lower limit of NHPT of the PF board was 2  h at 100  °C, while it took 168  h to reach it at 70  °C. The soaking {{time to reach}} the lower limit of LNR of the PF board was 24  h at 100  °C, {{but it did not}} take 168  h at 70  °C to reach it. The lower limit of the <b>nail</b> <b>joint</b> {{properties}} of the MDI board was very high. For the PF board, there was a high correlation between <b>nail</b> <b>joint</b> properties and basic properties. The <b>nail</b> <b>joint</b> properties of the MDI board having high initial MOR and IB did not significantly decrease as a result of high-temperature water soaking. If nailed MDI boards were subjected to outdoor exposure, the <b>nail</b> <b>joint</b> properties would be retained owing to high initial MOR and IB.|$|E
30|$|In actual timber structures, {{it may be}} {{rare for}} <b>nailed</b> <b>joint</b> {{connected}} with multiple nails to be wholly loaded {{perpendicular to the grain}}. However, that would be most rigorous conditions for <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> under lateral force because loading direction perpendicular to the grain is easy to split wood and shear resistance of its <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> may significantly decrease by main-member splitting. Therefore, if <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> connected with multiple nails to be wholly loaded perpendicular to the grain are confirmed to have sufficiently shear resistance, its specification of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> would be also effective for <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with inclined loading direction to the perpendicular to the grain.|$|R
40|$|Single shear {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on <b>nailed</b> timber <b>joints</b> with varying main member thickness, side member thickness and nail length projecting from the main member, and their effects on various shear performances of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> were investigated. Initial stiffness and yield load of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> were almost constant when the ratio of main member thickness to nail diameter (lm/d) was 7 - 14 and 10 - 14, respectively. Maximum load and energy capacity increased as main member thickness was greater and {{showed the highest values}} when lm/d was 13 - 17 and 13 - 15. respectively. Maximum load of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with lm/d of 9 was 36 % lower than that of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with lm/d of 13 - 17. Energy capacity of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with lm/d of 9 was 58 % lower than that of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with lm/d of 13 - 15. Regardless of nail length projecting from the main member (lnp), initial stiffness of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with lnp was close to that of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> without lnp. When the ratio of the sum of lm and lnp to nail diameter ratio (lr/d) was 10 - 11, maximum load and energy capacity of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with lnp were close to those of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> without lnp. When lr/d was 12 - 15, maximum load and energy capacity of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with lnp were lower than those of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> without lnp. When <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> have a member thickness according to the standard for structural design of timber structures edited by Architectural Institute of Japan, initial stiffness and yield load are little affected by member thickness but maximum load and energy capacity are greatly affected by member thickness. 主材と側材の厚さや主材からの釘の突き出し長さが 1 面せん断釘接合部のせん断性能に及ぼす影響を調べた。剛性係数は主材中の釘長さと釘径の比（lm/d）が 7 ～ 14 のとき概ね一定の値を示し、その後lm/dが大きくなるにつれ減少する傾向を示した。降伏荷重はlm/dが大きくなるにつれ増加し、lm/dが 10 ～ 14 のときに一定、その後lm/dが大きくなるにつれ減少する傾向を示した。最大荷重と吸収エネルギーはlm/dが大きくなるにつれ増加し、lm/dが 13 ～ 17 のとき最大荷重が、lm/dが 13 ～ 15 のとき吸収エネルギーが最も大きな値を示した。主材からの釘の突き出し長さにかかわらず剛性係数は概ね一定の値を示した。釘の突き出し長さが長い接合部の最大荷重と吸収エネルギーは突き出していない接合部より低い値となった。日本建築学会の木質構造設計規準・同解説に準じ、主材中の釘長さが釘径の 9 倍以上、側材厚が釘径の 6 倍以上であるとき、釘接合部の剛性係数と降伏荷重には大きな変化は見られないが、最大荷重と吸収エネルギーは部材の厚さによって大きな差が生じた...|$|R
30|$|Numerous {{studies have}} been {{performed}} to investigate the shear resistance of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints.</b> Most reports have focused on <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> parallel to the grain [2 – 6], {{and only a few}} studies have investigated the perpendicularly <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> [2, 4, 7, 8]. In particular, the collected data for split failures in <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> loaded perpendicular to the grain are insufficient. In this study, we have investigated the effects of wood species, nail dimensions, number of nails, and edge distances on the shear resistance of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> loaded perpendicular to the grain.|$|R
30|$|Given that {{boards are}} nailed when used for {{structural}} purposes, {{it is important}} to clarify the effects of water soaking on the properties of these boards. However, water soaking tests have been conducted not to assess <b>nail</b> <b>joint</b> property, but to assess the modulus of rupture (MOR) and internal bond strength (IB), which hereafter are defined as basic properties. Moreover, the relationships between <b>nail</b> <b>joint</b> properties and the basic properties of the board soaked in water have not been clarified.|$|E
30|$|Very few outdoor {{exposure}} {{tests have}} been conducted to assess <b>nail</b> <b>joint</b> property, and the first project included no such testing. Since boards are nailed when used for structural purposes, {{it is also important}} to clarify the effects of outdoor exposure on such property.|$|E
30|$|<b>Nail</b> <b>joint</b> {{property}} {{is a key}} element of structural boards. The outdoor environment to which the boards were exposed was very severe. The small decreases in shear load in one-plane in OSB(aspen), OSB(pine), and MDF(MDI) provide valuable data when applying the boards for structural purposes.|$|E
30|$|Shear {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> in wood that were loaded perpendicular to the grain; these joints had 21 specifications depending on different combinations of wood species, nail dimensions, number of nails, and edge distances of the main members, and their effects on the shear resistance of the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> were also investigated. The <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with CN 75 nails had higher initial stiffness than the joints with CN 50 nails, provided the initial stiffness of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> connected with 3 or 5 nails was not always a simple product {{of the number of}} nails and the initial stiffness of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> connected with a nail, and instead depended on the combination of wood species of the main member and nail dimensions. When the edge distance decreased, the maximum load and energy capacity decreased, thereby affecting the energy capacity. The maximum load of the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with CN 75 nails may be smaller than those with CN 50 nails depending on the combination of wood species and nail dimensions. When the edge distance of the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> was less than 26  mm, the energy capacity of the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with CN 75 nails was less than or similar to those with CN 50 nails.|$|R
30|$|Nail-head pull-through, lateral nail resistance, {{and single}} shear <b>nailed</b> <b>joint</b> tests were {{conducted}} on medium density fiberboard (MDF) with different density profiles, and {{the relations between the}} results of these tests and the density profiles of MDF were investigated. The maximum load of nail-head pull-through and the maximum load of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> were little affected by the density profile. However, the ultimate strength of lateral nail resistance, the stiffness, and the yield strength of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> were affected by the density profile of MDF and showed high values when the surface layer of the MDF had high density. It is known that bending performance is also influenced by density profile. Therefore, the stiffness and the yield strength of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> were compared with the bending performance of MDF. The stiffness of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> was positively correlated with the modulus of elasticity (MOE); in the case of CN 65 nails, the initial stiffness of joints changed little in response to changes in MOE. The yield strength of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> had a high positive correlation with the modulus of rupture (MOR). The stiffness and the yield strength of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> showed linear relationships with MOE and MOR, respectively.|$|R
30|$|In the {{standard}} [1], the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with the CN 75 nail is exhibited higher allowable shear strength than {{that with the}} CN 50 nail. However, when the nailing space is under restriction and the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> are loaded perpendicular to the grain, the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with the CN 75 nail did not always have greater shear resistance than that with the CN 50 nail.|$|R
30|$|Phenol-formaldehyde resin-bonded {{particleboard}} (PF board) and isocyanate resin-bonded particleboard (MDI board) were {{soaked in}} water at 40, 70 and 100  °C, and {{the relationships between}} soaking conditions and <b>nail</b> <b>joint</b> properties were analyzed. The soaking time to reach the lower limit of nail-head pull-through (NHPT) of the PF board was 2  h at 100  °C, while it took 168  h at 70  °C. The soaking time to reach the lower limit of lateral nail resistance (LNR) of the PF board was 24  h at 100  °C, {{but it did not}} take 168  h at 70  °C to reach it. The lower limits of NHPT and LNR for the MDI board were higher than those for the PF board. For the PF board, there was a high correlation between modulus of rupture, internal bond strength and <b>nail</b> <b>joint</b> properties. Based on the results of water soaking and outdoor exposure, it was shown that thickness change has a significant effect on NHPT and LNR, and that the reduction in NHPT and LNR results from the collapse of bonding points owing to swelling of the board.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere {{are a lot}} of {{traditional}} wooden houses, temples and shrines in Japan. These traditional wooden structures have already been standing for a long time. Many of these structural members and joints have suffered from biodeteriorations induced by fungi, termites and so on. It is difficult to know the residual strength of decayed structural members and joints. Therefore {{it is very important to}} evaluate the residual strength of structural members and joints for house in use for long term safety, and decide when repair and replacement of the members should be undertaken. The objective of this study is to evaluate the shear strength of nail joints attacked by fungi, which are often used in the wooden houses. In this study, we prepared the partial decayed specimens embedded by nails, and evaluated the shear strength. Those specimens were locally attacked by brown rot fungi (Fomitopsis palustris) for 7 weeks and evaluated the shear strength. In the case of steel <b>nail</b> <b>joint,</b> the shear strength of the decayed wood was higher than those of the sound wood. On the other hand, the shear strength of stainless steel <b>nail</b> <b>joint</b> was slightly decreased by the fungus attack...|$|E
30|$|<b>Nailed</b> <b>joints</b> {{are widely}} used as a {{principal}} choice for structural joints in timber constructions. The static lateral resistance of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> of various kinds, therefore, has been investigated from both the academic and the practical viewpoints [1 – 6]. The dynamic behavior of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints,</b> on the other hand, has not been clarified enough {{to be applied to}} the seismic design of timber constructions.|$|R
30|$|<b>Nailed</b> <b>joints</b> are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used joints in wooden houses, and they show shear resistance to lateral force. The <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> under lateral force are designed to avoid the brittle failure of wood while designing timber joints. It is known that split failures in <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> loaded perpendicular to the grain are affected by less thick wood, less spacing between nails, less edge and end distances, and wood species. The standard for structural design of timber structures—edited by Architectural Institute of Japan [1]—specifies that edge and end distances and spacing of nails must be equal to or greater than the minimum required for the design of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints.</b> In this standard, the allowable shear strength of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> without split failure of members is exhibited, and the same values regardless of loading direction to the grain are shown. Although <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with sufficient edge and end distances are preferable, it is difficult to always ensure this during the actual constructions of wooden houses. Because the width of the common frame members used in wooden houses are substantially fixed, less edge distance is often observed in the actual panel–frame joints. Therefore, it is important to accumulate the data regarding the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> failed by split of members under lateral force if consideration is given to the nailing conditions in the actual construction of wooden houses.|$|R

30|$|Figure  11 b {{shows the}} {{relationships}} between thickness change and the LNR retention of PF board exposed outdoors and soaked in water. The LNR retention decreased with increasing thickness change. Moreover, the LNR retention of PF board exposed outdoors was {{lower than that of}} PF board soaked in water. In board exposed outdoors, the deterioration of the edge was {{different from that of the}} center, with the former more prone to deteriorate than the latter. In particular, the former was also more prone to biodegrade. In compliance with ASTM, the LNR was conducted at the edge of the board and the NHPT was conducted at the center of the board [12]. The LNR of the board exposed outdoors was measured at the edge, whereas the NHPT of the board exposed outdoors was measured at the center (Fig.  2) [8]. Thus, the LNR of board exposed outdoors decreased more than that of board soaked in water. As for the basic properties, thickness change was shown to have a significant affect on <b>nail</b> <b>joint</b> properties. The high thickness change results in the collapse of the bonding points, which induces a decrease in bonding strength. The decreased strength of the bonding points causes a decrease in the strength of the <b>nail</b> <b>joint</b> properties.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} collect the data of outdoor {{exposure}} test on the latest boards manufactured by factories and then supplement the data on <b>nail</b> <b>joint</b> property, the second wood-based panel outdoor exposure project was recently conducted in eight areas of Japan: Asahikawa, Morioka, Noshiro, Tsukuba, Shizuoka, Okayama, Maniwa, and Miyakonojo. Details on the project {{can be found in}} Ref. [11]. The present report summarizes some of the test results obtained from Tsukuba (36 °N, 140 °E). In Tsukuba, the mean annual temperature was 14.3  °C with mean annual precipitation of 1, 368  mm from 2004 to 2009.|$|E
30|$|No {{method of}} {{assessing}} the <b>nail</b> <b>joint</b> property of wood-based panels subject to outdoor exposure {{has yet been}} established. In this study, stainless steel nails (SUS 304, 50  mm in length, 6.3  mm in head diameter, 2.75  mm in shank diameter) were driven at a point 12  mm from the lateral edge of the board before outdoor exposure to investigate degradation of LNR. A further set of 12 test samples, each 300  ×  300  mm, were also set on the exposure stand at four of the test sites: Morioka, Tsukuba, Okayama, and Miyakonojo. The four edges of the nail-driven samples were not coated with a waterproof agent to investigate the direct effect of panel edge degradation due to outdoor exposure on the LNR and IB near-panel edges. Two test samples were picked every year, and the LNR and IB were investigated after full reconditioning at 20  °C and relative humidity of 60 – 65  %. Further details of this method are provided in Ref. [19].|$|E
30|$|Energy {{capacity}} {{was significantly}} {{affected by the}} edge distance and exhibited large variations, depending on the combination of wood species and nail dimensions. When the edge distance of the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> loaded {{perpendicular to the grain}} was less than 26  mm, the energy capacity of the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with the CN 75 nail was either slightly different or smaller than those with the CN 50 nail.|$|R
30|$|The {{relative}} slips {{between the}} main and side {{members of the}} <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> connected with 1 and 3 or 5 nails were measured by two and three displacement transducers, respectively. One or two displacement transducers were located in the front side of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints,</b> and one displacement transducer was located in the back side, see Fig.  2. The relative slip for loading procedure was used the values measured by the displacement transducers located in the front side. When the joints connected with 3 or 5 nails, that relative slip was the average values of two displacement transducers. The load was applied up to a relative slip of 1  mm, and subsequently, reduced to 0  kN. This loading procedure was repeated to produce relative slips of 2, 3, and 4  mm. The slip level was determined from the load–slip curves obtained from the preliminary monotonic loading tests of the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> S 26 – 50 and D 26 – 50 whose nailing conditions satisfied the standard [1]. The load was then monotonically increased and the tests were terminated when the load decreased to 50  % of the maximum load. The <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> were loaded {{at the rate of}} relative slip, which was the average slip on the centerline of <b>nailed</b> <b>joint,</b> of between 0.02 and 0.08  mm/s [13].|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master thesis has been to {{investigate}} the possibility to increase the damping capacity of shear walls {{with the use of}} glue in combination with nails. It has been done with experiment and with FE-simulations.   The first experimental part is tensile tests of four different glue types which have been analyzed to get material data. The second experimental part is analysis of glued-nail joint in shear test. FE-simulations of glued-nail joints are finally done in Abaqus/CAE.   The experiments in shear tests of glued-nail joints showed that two glues failed and could not be used for further analysis. The two other glues had an increase in damping capacity compared with results from <b>nail</b> <b>joint.</b>   Further FE-simulations of glued-nailed joints have to be done in order to calibrate the FE-model with the results of glued-nailed joints in shear tests.

Experimental investigations of the damping and the "backbone" curve of singlenaild joints as well as of simple composite nailed structures have been made.

30|$|With {{the recent}} concern toward wood {{utilization}} in large-scale structures, increasing the strength performance of structural elements is important. Developing structural elements using board materials {{is one of}} the measures to increase the strength performance. A high-performance <b>nailed</b> <b>joint</b> to resist shear loading is necessary to increase the strength performance of wooden structural elements using board materials. This study was conducted {{in order to understand the}} shear properties of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> intended for large-scale structures. Shear tests were conducted with <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> using structural plywood, medium density fiberboard, or particleboard. The yield resistance was determined from experimental load-slip displacement curves, and was also calculated using European yield theory (EYT). Consequently, the <b>nailed</b> <b>joint</b> specimens using MDF showed an experimental yield resistance higher than those using structural sugi plywood. The <b>nailed</b> <b>joint</b> specimens using PB also showed a high value similar to that of the joints using structural karamatsu plywood. The yield resistance of most of the joint specimen series calculated using European yield theory showed slightly higher values than the experimental yield resistance. This study observed the deformation behavior around nail the head under shear loading. No deformation was observed from the appearance at the initial region of the test. The nail head started a rotational deformation when the joint started yielding. Moreover, the side panel became partially embedded. The nail head was completely embedded at the maximum load of the specimen. Nail pull-out from the base material was not remarkably evident. This deformation behavior was observed in all the board materials used in this study.|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{dynamic tests}} of <b>nailed</b> plywood-timber <b>joints</b> are {{conducted}} under a band-limited white-noise wave using a uniaxial hydraulic shaking table. The principal results are as follows: dynamic responses of <b>nailed</b> plywood-timber <b>joints</b> under a band-limited white-noise wave are reasonably {{related to the}} static load-slip relationships and the dynamic responses under harmonic waves of them. When <b>nailed</b> plywood-timber <b>joints</b> are shaken under a composite wave of wide frequency range, they resonate transitionally {{with one of the}} frequency components one after another decreasing their equivalent resonant frequencies along their static load-slip curves. <b>Nailed</b> plywood-timber <b>joints</b> are in danger of ultimate failures even though the input maximum accelerations do not exceed their damage limits, if they are shaken for long times with or without intermittences. In this case, <b>nailed</b> plywood-timber <b>joints</b> are prone to fail in low-cyclic bending fatigue failure of <b>nails.</b> <b>Nailed</b> plywood-timber <b>joints,</b> on the other hand, are prone to fail in typical static failure modes when they are shaken under strong input maximum accelerations equivalent to their ultimate limits.|$|R
30|$|The {{general view}} of the test results {{indicates}} that <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> are likely damaged by the frequency components of seismic waves close to their higher resonant frequencies below the damage-limit or serviceability-limit resistance. However, the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> are ultimately broken by the lower frequency components of seismic waves, to which damaged joints with degraded stiffness resonate. The transition of the responsive behavior of the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> affects the seismic resistance of entire structures. If the principal frequency components of seismic waves {{are close to the}} resonant frequencies after cyclic stiffness degradation of the nailed structural elements, structures are prone to collapse readily under strong earthquakes. If the principal frequency components of seismic waves are close to their resonant frequencies below the damage-limit or serviceability-limit resistance, on the other hand, the structures are initially prone to be damaged, but the resultant stiffness degradation may enable the structures to survive strong earthquakes. This discussion leads to an important conclusion that structural engineers should distinguish between principal frequency components dominant to the ultimate or safety-limit resistance and those dominant to the damage-limit or serviceability-limit resistance [12].|$|R
30|$|Dynamic {{tests of}} <b>nailed</b> plywood–timber <b>joints</b> are {{conducted}} under harmonic vibrations from 2 to 7  Hz. The principal results are as follows: under dynamic loading, <b>nailed</b> plywood–timber <b>joints</b> may break in low-cyclic bending fatigue failure of nails besides the other failure modes typical under static loading. The dynamic response of <b>nailed</b> plywood–timber <b>joints</b> is clearly dependent upon both the input frequency and the acceleration. These responsive characteristics {{arise from the}} nonlinear load–slip relationships and the characteristic cyclic stiffness degradation of nailed joints; that is, the cyclic degradation of the equivalent linear stiffness decreases the resonant frequencies of the same joints, which results in a transition of dynamic responses. It indicates that frequency components of seismic waves resonant to the frequencies corresponding to safety-limit stiffness of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> may lead them to critical failures, even if the accelerations do not exceed the accelerations equivalent to the static damage-limit resistance.|$|R

30|$|The <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> loaded {{perpendicular}} to the grain with the CN 75 nail did not always have a higher maximum load than those with the CN 50 nail; the maximum load was sometimes smaller, depending on the combination of wood species and nail dimensions.|$|R
30|$|The shear {{resistance}} of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> loaded {{perpendicular to the}} grain was determined from two wood species for main member, which were low and high density of structural softwood members, two thicknesses of side member, and two nail sizes. The main members of the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> were prepared from solid lumbers of Sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) whose cross-sections were more than 100  mm ×  100  mm. The average density of Sugi and Douglas fir were 353  kg/m 3 (standard deviation 38.4  kg/m 3) and 541  kg/m 3 (standard deviation 35.3  kg/m 3), respectively. The average moisture contents of Sugi and Douglas fir were 13.2  % (standard deviation 0.365  %) and 14.2  % (standard deviation 0.651  %), respectively.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Defining the inelastic {{behavior}} of <b>nail</b> <b>joints</b> {{is essential in}} the development of a rational design procedure of wood-stud walls.

The equations relate three elastic moduli that define the average inelastic joint stiffness to the material properties of the wall coverings, studs and nails. The equations were verified experimentally on joints between Douglas-fir studs and 3 / 8 -inch plywood sheathing. Experiments also showed that the stiffness of machine pushed <b>nail</b> <b>joints</b> was less variable than that of their hammer driven mates, and that increased nail head size produced stiffer joints.

30|$|The {{frequency}} components resonant to {{the frequencies}} {{corresponding to the}} safety-limit stiffness may lead the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> to critical failures when dynamic forces act continuously or are repeatedly for enough cycles, even if the input accelerations do not exceed the accelerations equivalent to the static damage-limit resistance.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 To apply {{accurate}} {{procedures of}} structural analysis {{that are now}} available, the behavior of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> in light-frame wood buildings under long-term loads needs to be studied. Such a behavior can best be evaluated by testing specimens under constant loads, which requires relatively simple testing arrangements. To provide for a practical use of the constant-load test results, theoretical models were developed that predict the behavior of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> under varying loads that are subjected to wood structures in service. Existing models and principles were used to develop five new general models, all of which account for the nonlinear viscous-viscoelastic behavior of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints.</b> The models incorporated the modified superposition principle and strain hardening principle. Heaviside function and Fourier series were also incorporated to describe varying loads that can be either discrete or mathematically defined continuous function. To develop experimental data needed for the formulation and verification of the models developed, joints made of Douglas-fir lumber, plywood and 6 d nails were tested under four constant and four varying loads. The experimental data for constant loads were used to formulate specific theoretical models which were further modified for varying loads. The comparison between the predicted and the corresponding test results shows a very good agreement for all the specific models. The models that include the modified superposition principle are the most accurate and the simplest to apply to <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> under discrete load functions. Fourier series representation of varying-load functions shows a great potential for practical applications, because it can represent the service loads more accurately than the discrete approximation. The specific models presented are limited {{to the type of}} joints used in this investigation. Other types of joints need to be tested under constant loads to develop appropriate equations that describe their creep behavior under varying loads...|$|R
