In terms of who migrates, circular migrant workers {{are more likely to be}} male, have primary education, and come from more rural and less developed areas. Education, gender, age, and the reasons for return from the first migration all affect the choice of migration form. In addition, circular migration rates are high among the poor.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Adam Mitchell was first conceived, along with Henry van Statten, during Davies' pitch to the BBC, {{in a story}} heavily based on Robert Shearman's audio play Jubilee called [...] "Return of the Daleks". The production team had always intended for Adam to join the TARDIS after Rose developed a liking for him. To play this role, Bruno Langley was chosen, previously known for his role on Coronation Street as Todd Grimshaw. It was never intended for Adam to be a long-term companion, Davies wanted to show that <b>not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> suitable to join the TARDIS crew and dubbed him [...] "The Companion That Couldn't", he [...] "always {{wanted to do a}} show with someone who was a rubbish companion".|$|E

2500|$|Confucius did {{not believe}} in the concept of [...] "democracy", which is itself an Athenian concept unknown in ancient China, but could be {{interpreted}} by Confucius's principles recommending against individuals electing their own political leaders to govern them, or that anyone is capable of self-government. He expressed fears that the masses lacked the intellect to make decisions for themselves, and that, in his view, since <b>not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> created equal, not everyone has a right of self-government.|$|E
2500|$|Since <b>not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> {{irritated by}} the same {{lighting}} sources, {{it is common for}} one person's light [...] "pollution" [...] to be light that is desirable for another. One example of this is found in advertising, when an advertiser wishes for particular lights to be bright and visible, even though others find them annoying. Other types of light pollution are more certain. For instance, light that accidentally crosses a property boundary and annoys a neighbor is generally wasted and pollutive light.|$|E
2500|$|A new {{controversy}} has erupted over the plans {{to restore the}} Kossuth Square {{in front of the}} Parliament building. The changes would include the removal of all monuments added since 1945 and replacing them with pre–1944 sculptures. In this plan, a 1980 sculpture of one of the greatest Hungarian poets, Attila József would be replaced by a monument of one–time prime minister Gyula Andrássy. <b>Not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> overly worried about the government's actions, though. For example, artist Miklós Szűts believes that [...] "the government might make symbolic gestures, like the paintings they commissioned, but they don’t have a major effect in reality.” However, the Socialist opposition planted a tree on Earth Day 2012 {{at the end of the}} square in protest of the government's undemocratic actions of modifying the space [...] "without asking the people".|$|E

Simon Cowell showed his support for Sandé {{and said she was}} his [...] "favourite songwriter at the moment". After she began penning tracks for the likes of Cher Lloyd, Susan Boyle, Alexandra Burke and Leona Lewis who are all signed to Cowell's record label, Syco Music. She also revealed that it was never an option to go out and sing other artists' songs which they had written for her. She wanted the whole album to be her own, and every song to be written by herself. She said [...] "For me to feel empowered by music, it has to be my own. The message that the lyric carries is as important to me as singing in tune. <b>Not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> a writer or wants to be, so shows like that can be a great way of getting exposure – and as we're all aware, this is a tough industry to break into. I just know I'd have found it very difficult to go out and sing other people's songs week after week, though. It simply wouldn't have felt truthful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though {{the couple}} was popular, they were also controversial. Sosnovska was asked if she {{realized}} that by accepting this role she would be stepping into [...] "so much" [...] controversy. [...] "I’m still {{coming to terms with}} this phenomenon of Lianca," [...] she replied, [...] "with the devotion that I’m shown as a couple on TV, and the whole concept of fans. The letters that I get are heart breaking. It’s horrible that even now in the 21st century [...] feel the need to hide. <b>Not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> confident enough to face the world, and not everyone lives in a safe environment." [...] She continued, [...] "I never really thought about it before--it doesn’t occur to you that this medieval type of mentality occurs. It’s horrifying what happens." [...] Sosnovska did, however, see the decision to be out as a personal choice. [...] "I don’t blame people who choose not be out," [...] she said. She donated her time to fan sponsored fundraisers that raised money for several charities connected to the Lena and Bianca storylines. Over $20,000 had been raised for the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project. Sosnovska stated, [...] "I would never have known what a powerful tool TV could be, especially daytime. It’s frightening to the extent it’s a huge responsibility on the producers, directors, and actors to influence minds. You can’t underestimate the force of it." ...|$|E
