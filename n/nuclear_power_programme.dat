5|$|Arnold {{returned}} to {{working on the}} hydrogen bomb book, but 1987 was the 30th anniversary of the Windscale accident. Rather than let {{the records of the}} accident and subsequent inquiries be released over several years, Arnold persuaded the Public Records Office to release them all at once. In meetings with the various responsible government agencies, the topic of a book about Windscale came up, and Arnold decided to write one, which became Windscale 1957: Anatomy of a Nuclear Accident in 1992. Gowing, in poor health, retired from the UKAEA in 1993. By this time her two research assistants had also left, and Arnold feared that the UKAEA Council would shut down the hydrogen bomb book project, which she hoped to follow up with one on the UK civil <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>programme.</b> The UKAEA Council decided to press on with the project, asking Arnold to stay on although she was now over seventy years old. In 1993, she was joined by Katherine Pyne, an aircraft engineer working on a history degree, who became her research assistant for two years. However, the end was in sight. The UKAEA no longer had responsibility for nuclear weapons, and management was not interested in it. With funds for the project almost exhausted, the UKAEA Council decided that Arnold should retire in 1996. She loaded her notes into her car and took them home. Sympathetic friends at the Ministry of Defence found some money to cover her expenses, and she doggedly worked on it from home. Britain and the H-Bomb finally appeared in 2001.|$|E

25|$|The Bruce {{plant was}} {{commissioned}} in 1979 to provide heavy {{water for a}} large increase in Ontario's nuclear power generation.

In addition, the <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>programme</b> was slowed down and effectively stopped due to a perceived oversupply of electricity, later shown to be temporary, in 1993.

Also, the Girdler process involves large amounts of hydrogen sulfide, raising environmental concerns if there should be a release. The Bruce heavy water plant was shut down in 1997, after which the plant was gradually dismantled and the site cleared.|$|E
500|$|The use {{of thorium}} {{as a power}} source has been explored. The {{earliest}} thorium-based reactor was built at the Indian Point Energy Center in the United States in 1962. India {{has one of the}} largest supplies of thorium in the world and not much uranium, and targeted in the 1950s achieving energy independence with their three-stage <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>programme.</b> In most countries, [...] uranium was relatively abundant and the progress of thorium-based reactors was therefore slow; in the 20thcentury, 3reactors were built in India and 12 elsewhere. Large-scale research was begun in 1996 by the International Atomic Energy Agency to study the use of thorium reactors; a year later, the United States Department of Energy started their research on the matter. Alvin Radkowsky of Tel Aviv University in Israel was the head designer of the first American civilian nuclear power plant in Shippingport, Pennsylvania, whose third core bred thorium. He founded a consortium to develop thorium reactors, which included other laboratories: Raytheon Nuclear Inc. and Brookhaven National Laboratory in the United States, and the Kurchatov Institute in Russia. In the 21stcentury, thorium's potential for reducing nuclear proliferation and its waste characteristics led to renewed interest in the thorium fuel cycle.|$|E

40|$|The {{system of}} third party {{liability}} for nuclear damage {{established in the}} 1960 s has been the model for many national legal systems in countries with <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>programmes.</b> However, this approach has been criticised. It is argued that, with compensation limited to certain types of damage and with limits set well below the possible consequences of an accident, not all damage arising from an accident might be compensated. Moreover, relatively low levels of operator liability mean that risks associated with <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> are borne {{by the general public}} and that the generation of nuclear electricity is effectively subsidised. Debate about nuclear liability and compensation arrangements increased markedly after the 1986 Chernobyl accident, which brought into stark relief numerous deficiencies in the existing regimes. The subsequent revision of the international nuclear liability and compensation conventions has sought to address this criticism by establishing higher liability amounts and broadening the range of compensable nuclear damage, whilst leaving much of the original 1960 s liability and compensation structure unchanged. ...|$|R

Most of that new capacity will be built in countries that already have operating <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plants.

This has been the challenge facing Nigeria. The national grid has an installed capacity of 6, 000 MW, but only about 4, 000 MW is obtainable. Also, pipeline vandalisation disrupts the supply lines to the few functional plants, while water shortage and irregular supply incapacitate the effective functioning of the nation’s hydroelectric power plants. These factors along with the increasing national energy demand for both domestic and industrial purposes made the <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> option attractive to Nigeria and informed the nation’s pursuit of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> option. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>power</b> has not only been adjudged economically competitive and environmentally friendly, but is also a viable alternative for long-term energy security. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plants have low operational costs and the added advantage of long life spans.

For these countries it is sensible to consider an option of shared deep disposal facilities. The prospect of regional solutions is raised in the draft of the EC radioactive waste Directive to be adopted by May 2004. The directive assumes that Each Member State shall establish a clearly defined programme for radioactive waste management that includes all radioactive waste under its jurisdiction and covers all stages of management including disposal. Even some milestones to be incorporated into national waste management programmes are given in the Directive together with very demanding deadlines. The national programmes may also include export of radioactive waste or spent fuel under certain conditions. The presented paper contains an analysis of the Directive provisions, which could lead to the need for regional repositories in Europe. Recognizing the need to pave the way to regional European repositories, ARIUS (Association for Regional and International Underground Storage) together with DECOM Slovakia submitted a proposal for a project within 6 th Framework Programme named SAPIERR (Support Action: Pilot Initiative for European Regional Repositories). Acknowledging the importance of the proposed project in the framework of the above Directive, the evaluators of the European Commission judged SAPIERR positively and invited the proponents to contractual negotiations.
