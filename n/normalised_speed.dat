40|$|Temporal and {{distance}} parameters of 33 normal children {{were obtained from}} instrumented gait analysis prospectively over five consecutive years. The parameters were normalised to minimise the confounding effects of increasing height and leg length. Rank correlations were performed on <b>normalised</b> <b>speed,</b> normalised stride length, normalised cadence and normalised walk ratio across consecutive pairs of years to examine the ranking of these parameters for an individual child over time. Consistent trends of increasing rank correlation were observed in normalised stride length and normalised walk ratio suggesting that individual children were continuing to adjust these gait parameters towards their own characteristic position within the normal range. Consistent trends were not observed in the rank correlations for <b>normalised</b> <b>speed</b> and normalised cadence. These findings support the concept that individual children predominantly adjusted their cadence to effect changes in speed, while the development of stride length was dictated by other factors specific to the individual child. Rank correlation coefficients for walk ratio between consecutive years increased from the ages of 7 - 11 {{years of age and}} hence walk ratio appears be a feature of gait that matures beyond the age of 7 years. This accords with the proposal that it is an invariant parameter for an individual...|$|E

The results of changes in speed on gait parameters were examined using dimensionless analysis on data from a prospective 5 -year study of 16 children. Linear regression analysis of peak and trough values of temporal distance parameters, ground reaction forces, joint angles, moments and powers provide a quantitative description of gait development with <b>normalised</b> <b>speed.</b> These linear relationships {{can be used to}} estimate gait parameters from speed measurements for normal subjects. However, caution is advised in using the data to attempt to predict an individual's gait parameters due to the wide spread of data about the regression lines and we do not recommend that the data be used to extrapolate the regression data to wider speed ranges...|$|E

The influence of age, gender, leg length, modified speed or dual tasking is unclear. Cross-sectional analysis was performed on a data registry containing demographic, physical and spatial-temporal gait parameters recorded in five walking conditions with a GAITRite® electronic carpet in community-dwelling older persons with memory complaints. Four cognitive stages were studied: cognitively healthy individuals, mild cognitive impaired patients, mild dementia patients and advanced dementia patients. The association between spatial-temporal gait characteristics and cognitive stages was the most prominent: in the entire study population using gait speed, steps per meter (translation for mean step length), swing time variability, <b>normalised</b> gait <b>speed</b> (corrected for leg length) and normalised steps per meter at all five walking conditions; in the 50 -to- 70 years old participants applying step width at fast pace and steps per meter at usual pace; in the 70 -to- 80 years old persons using gait <b>speed</b> and <b>normalised</b> gait <b>speed</b> at usual pace, fast pace, animal walk and counting walk or steps per meter and normalised steps per meter at all five walking conditions; in over- 80 years old participants using gait <b>speed,</b> <b>normalised</b> gait <b>speed,</b> steps per meter and normalised steps per meter at fast pace and animal dual-task walking. Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for gender predicted in two compiled models the presence of dementia or cognitive impairment with acceptable accuracy in persons with memory complaints.

This study suggested that multifactorial gait analysis could be more informative than using gait analysis with only one test or one variable.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Both ageing {{and speed}} {{definitely}} affect gait patterns. Since {{most of the}} comparisons between young and elderly people while walking {{have been carried out}} at different "self-selected" speeds, results might be biased by a lack of control of the effects of both the concomitant issues. Therefore, further investigations aimed at separating the influence of both the sources of variability are required. METHODS: Nine young and eight elderly healthy subjects walked on a treadmill at five <b>normalised</b> <b>speeds</b> according to the Froude Number, from 0. 5 to 1. 3 m/s. Step parameters and peaks belonging to kinematic and kinetic patterns have been compared between the groups and over the five speeds by the two-factor (Group and Speed) ANOVA. FINDINGS: After making walking speed comparable between the groups, in elders, hip and knee concentric powers during the stance phase were higher than in young subjects despite their decreased ankle plantarflexor kinetics. Kinematic differences occurred in conjunction with the modifications of the kinetic patterns. INTERPRETATION: Since proximal and distal extensor muscles contribute to the same functional tasks during walking (e. g., stabilisation, forward acceleration of the trunk, body support against gravity), ageing would involve a different sharing of muscle efforts among leg joints, increasing the work load of the proximal extensor muscles. Moreover, gait analysis, when carried out at controlled and comparable speeds, can better pinpoint features of each group of subjects than the comparison at self-selected speed...|$|R
40|$|Tests of {{postural}} stability {{have provided}} {{some evidence of}} a link between deficits in gross motor skills and developmental dyslexia. The ordinal-level scales used previously, however, have limited measurement sensitivity, and no studies have investigated motor performance during walking in participants with dyslexia. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate if continuous-scaled measures of standing balance and gait could discriminate between groups of impaired and normal readers when investigators were blind to group membership during testing. Children with dyslexia (n= 22) and controls (n= 18), aged 10 - 12 years, performed walking tests at four different speeds (slow-preferred-fast-very fast) on an even and an uneven surface, and tests of unperturbed and perturbed body sway during standing. Body movements were registered by a triaxial accelerometer over the lower trunk, and measures of reaction time, body sway, walking speed, step length and cadence were calculated. Results were controlled for gender differences. Tests of standing balance with eyes closed did not discriminate between groups. All unperturbed standing tests with eyes open showed significant group differences (P< 0. 05) and classified correctly 70 - 77. 5 % of the subjects into their respective groups. Mean walking speed during very fast walking on both flat and uneven surface was ≥ 0. 2 m/s (P≤ 0. 01) faster for controls than for the group with dyslexia. This test classified 77. 5 % and 85 % of the subjects correctly on flat and uneven surface, respectively Cadence at preferred or very fast speed did not differ statistically between groups, but revealed significant group differences when all subjects were compared at a normalised walking speed (P≤ 0. 04). Very fast walking speed as well as cadence at a <b>normalised</b> <b>speed</b> discriminated better between groups when subjects were walking on an uneven surface compared to a flat floor. Continuous-scaled walking tests performed in field settings may be suitable for motor skill assessment as a component of a screening tool for developmental dyslexia...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Pacing {{strategies}} {{during exercise}} {{are attributed to}} optimising the balance between the artefacts of fatigue and regulation of substrate metabolism. Pace judgement is set within a continuum of information from the ability to anticipate metabolic demands and select an appropriate strategy through to the accumulation of prior experience for completion of such a task that has a known end-point. Therefore {{the purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the importance of athlete experience to successfully regulate pace and attain a predicted end time during a marathon. METHOD: Following local institutional ethical approval n= 777 runners competing in the 2015 London Marathon agreed to participate. Using an on-line survey and opportunistic questionnaire at a pre-marathon event participants were asked to predict their race time. Athlete experience (EXP) was established based on the number of previously completed marathons using a Likert scale from 0 to greater than 10 with increments of 1 race. Athlete age was also recorded. All race data was downloaded from the race website generating 5 Km split times, then converted to speed and normalised (%) to the final split time/speed (m. s- 1). Prediction time (PT) was used a proxy for end-point and compared to finish time (FT). RESULTS: FT for whole group (WG) was 15479 ± 3311 s compared to the group PT 15003 ± 2972 s a significant difference of 476 s (P= 0. 0001). An R 2 of 0. 863 observed for WG compared to 0. 799 (EXP- 0) and 0. 852 (EXP- 5) when comparing FT to PT. Significant differences observed between PT and FT for all EXP groups apart from EXP- 5 (P= 0. 0001). EXP- 0 showed significant difference across all split times apart from 35 - 40 km (P= 0. 0001) with a decrease in <b>normalised</b> <b>speed</b> from 5 km (109. 0 ± 7. 6) – 40 km (89. 9 ± 7. 4 %). The EXP- 5 group showed significant changes in pace between 25 - 30 km (P= 0. 001) (ES= 0. 35) and 30 - 35 km (P= 0. 0001) (ES= 0. 44), decrease in pace from 5 km (105. 0 ± 5. 7 %) to 40 km (93. 7 ± 5. 6 %). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that successful marathon pacing is dependent on the experience of the athlete reflecting the development of the pacing template. Additionally experience is associated with better attainment of prediction time suggesting that less experienced runners should run with more experienced athletes with similar end-point targets...|$|E
40|$|Sex {{differences}} in pacing patterns {{are reported in}} triathlons (Vleck et al., 2008, Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, 11, 424 – 432) and 1 -mile runs (Foster et al., 2014, International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance, 9, 715 – 719) but not in 100 - to 1500 -m swimming events (Robertson et al., 2009, Journal of Sports Sciences, 27, 387 – 395). Successful pacing patterns for males, i. e., those leading to a medal winning performance, can be identified using competition data in the 400 -m freestyle swim (Mytton et al., 2015, International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance, 10, 369 – 373). Given the lack of existing research, {{the aim of this}} study was to identify successful pacing patterns in the 400 -m freestyle swim for elite females. Following approval from Northumbria University ethics committee, 100 -m split times were collected from finals in the 400 -m freestyle between 2006 and 2012 including European, World and Commonwealth competitions. Times from 48 performances were converted into normalised lap speed, compared between medallists and non-medallists and relative to the gold medallist. A Kruskal– Wallis test was followed by an estimation of the magnitude of the effect (Cohen’s d). Female medallists display a significantly faster <b>normalised</b> <b>speed</b> in lap 3 (P = 0. 030, moderate effect) and lap 4 (P = 0. 015, moderate effect) compared to non-medallists but were slower in lap 2 (P = 0. 006 moderate effect). When expressed relative to the gold medallist, the lower finishing places swam significantly slower in laps 1, 3 and 4 (P = 0. 045, 0. 009 and 0. 001, respectively) but not compared to second and third places. To win a medal in 400 -m swimming, it appears necessary to vary pace by adopting a more conservative pace in the early stages of a race to allow for a relatively greater increase in speed at the end resulting in a U-shaped pattern. The successful female athletes demonstrated this by conserving energy in the second lap thereby preserving capacity for an end-spurt due to a lower prior physiological disturbance. The U-shaped pattern was flatter than observed in male swimmers who reduced speed to a greater extent early on and increased speed more later on (Mytton et al., 2015). More research is needed to understand why this flatter profile exists, for example it could be that females have less confidence to conserve speed early in a race and therefore don’t have the same reserves by the end or the opposite could be true and that over-confidence early on leads to less reserves at the end of the race. Alternatively, females may not be required to increase their speed as much in the latter stages in order to win because the winning margins are greater than in the men’s event...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{the organization of}} joint angle variability during walking by using the uncontrolled manifold (UCM) theory. We tested two hypotheses: i. the coordinative mechanism underlying joint angle variance during the stance phase is compatible with a kinematic synergy that stabilizes the centre of mass (CoM) position; ii. the walking speed affects the variance components onto and orthogonal to the UCM. Eight healthy subjects (26. 0. Â±. 2. 0. years old) steadily walked on a treadmill at five <b>normalised</b> <b>speeds</b> (from 0. 62. Â±. 0. 03. m/s to 1. 15. Â±. 0. 07. m/s). Joint angles and foot orientation, and components of the CoM position were, respectively, used as elemental variables and task performance for the UCM implementation. The effect of speed, time events, and variance components {{on the distribution of}} data variance in the space of joint angles was analyzed by the ANOVA test. Results corroborated the hypothesis that the variance of elemental variables is structured in order to minimize the stride-to-stride variability of the CoM position, at all speeds. Noticeably, both variance components increase during the propulsive phase, albeit that parallel to the UCM was always grater than the orthogonal one. Accordingly, the observed kinematic synergy is supposed to contribute to accomplishing an efficient transition between two steps. Results also revealed that the walking speed does not affect the partitioning of elemental variables-related variance onto and orthogonal to the UCM. Accordingly, the organization of leg joint variance underlying the stabilization of CoM position remains almost unaltered across speeds...|$|R

40|$|Here, Ground {{moving target}} {{indication}} (GMTI) using {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) is considered. SAR GMTI requires that relative speed between the target and the SAR platform {{is included in the}} detection algorithm. A separation between the true relative speed and the relative speed used in the SAR process will cause unfocused targets, and decrease detectability. Blind hypotheses of relative speeds are used in the detection phase of moving targets in SAR. The step size between the hypotheses (or discretisation step) in relative speed involves a trade off between the number of hypotheses to test and detectability. A large number of tests will increase detectability but will also increase computation load and vice versa. The relevance of relative speed increases as the azimuth integration time gets larger. Long integration time is associated with low signature moving target detection in strong clutter environments, or for SAR GMTI at low frequencies.

OBJECTIVES: evaluate the effects of fatigue on rectus femoris RF, vastus lateralis VL and vastus medialis VM and biceps femoris BF and semitendinosus ST during a high-level bodyboard competition using tensiomyography TMG. METHODS: subjects were 11 highly experienced years of practice: 15, SD= 4. 65 male bodyboarders age: 28. 17, SD= 2. 89, body weight: 74. 83, SD= 6. 13 kg; height: 179. 25, SD= 3. 93 cm; BMI: 23. 29, SD= 1. 81 participating in the final of the 2010 Spanish championship. RESULTS: the fatigue is especially evident due to a decrease in the values of relaxation time Tr and sustain time Ts caused by the specific characteristics of waves, how the waves evolve and the type of manoeuvre executed in competition due to the wave characteristics. The maximum radial displacement Dm value increased slightly in all muscles analysed and <b>normalised</b> response <b>speed</b> Vrn was stable, with a tendency to improve as athletes adapted to the type of physical effort and the environmental conditions of the competition.

The data were recorded with a smart cricket ball and a Cortex motion analysis system. The maximal normalised precession {{at the beginning}} of the finger torque increased from topspin to backspin.

40|$|We {{perform a}} series of 2 D {{smoothed}} particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of gas accretion onto binaries via a circumbinary disc, {{for a range of}} gas temperatures and binary mass ratios (q). We show that increasing the gas temperature increases the accretion rate onto the primary for all values of the binary mass ratio: for example, for q= 0. 1 and a fixed binary separation, an increase of <b>normalised</b> sound <b>speed</b> by a factor of 5 (from our "cold" to "hot" simulations) changes the fraction of the accreted gas that flows on to the primary from 10 % to ∼ 40 %. We present a simple parametrisation for the average accretion rate of each binary component accurate to within a few percent and argue that this parametrisation (rather than those in the literature based on warmer simulations) is relevant to supermassive black hole accretion and all but the widest stellar binaries. We present trajectories for the growth of q during circumbinary disc accretion and argue that the period distribution of stellar "twin" binaries is strong evidence for the importance of circumbinary accretion. We also show that our parametrisation of binary accretion increases the minimum mass ratio needed for spin alignment of supermassive black holes to q ∼ 0. 4, with potentially important implications for the magnitude of velocity kicks acquired during black hole mergers.

40|$|It {{is argued}} that a simple {{explanation}} for the westward propagation of Indian monsoon depressions (IMDs) is {{the interaction of the}} depression vortex with the Himalayan ‘wall’. This interaction can be modelled by simulating an IMD as a point vortex in a horizontal plane (at 850 hPa) and invoking image vortices behind the barrier. Solenoidal flows associated with the image vortices allow the boundary conditions at the Himalayas to be met, and cause the IMD vortex to propagate parallel to the barrier, toward the west. This simple model is tested against propagation speeds for observed IMDs. The histogram of observed propagation <b>speed,</b> <b>normalised</b> by the point-vortex model prediction, has a mean of 1. 08 and standard deviation of 0. 68.

40|$|A special gait-training programme, {{combining}} {{a psychological}} therapeutic approach with methods in physiotherapy and body awareness, {{was used to}} re-educate nine unilateral trans-femoral amputees. All were rehabilitated trauma or tumour amputees with an age of 16 - 60 years. They had worn prostheses for more than 18 months. The re-education aimed at integrating the prosthesis in normal movements and increasing body awareness. Gait was measured before and after treatment and at 6 months follow-up with a three-dimensional motion analysis system. Results showed almost <b>normalised</b> gait <b>speed</b> and increased symmetry in the hip joints with increased muscle work on the amputated side both immediately and at follow-up. At follow-up {{there were significant differences}} in almost all parameters between the two legs of the subjects and when compared to a reference group of 18 healthy volunteers of similar age. Thus, the intact leg compensates for loss of function in the amputated leg and thereby works differently compared to the reference group. For example, during shock absorption the extension moment in the intact knee increased from 0. 6 Nm/kg before to 1. 0 Nm/kg after treatment and at follow-up compared to 0. 4 Nm/kg in the reference group. The eccentric power of quadriceps increased from 0. 6 w/kg before to 1. 8 w/kg after treatment and 1. 7 w/kg at follow-up compared to 0. 4 w/kg in the reference group.

In their service area they found 16 such current prosthetic users with at least 2 years of prosthetic experience and 9 who could complete the programme. Gait was measured before and after treatment and at 6 months follow-up with a three-dimensional motion analysis system and was compared to a reference group of 18 healthy volunteers of similar age.

Pelvic internal rotation on the amputated side increased to about 8 degrees {{in the beginning of}} stance. The amputated and the intact side before treatment were more symmetrical than afterwards and also when compared with the reference group. In spite of this, gait appeared to be more symmetrical, probably due to more efficient pelvic motion and more symmetrical upper-body movements.

40|$|The {{inverted}} pendulum {{model in}} which the centre of mass of the body vaults over the stance leg in an arc represents a basic mechanism of bipedal walking. Is the pendulum mechanism innate, or is it learnt through walking experience? We studied eight toddlers (about 1 year old) at their first unsupported steps, 18 older children (1. 3 - 13 years old), and ten adults. Two infants were also tested repeatedly {{over a period of}} 4 months before the onset of independent walking. Pendulum mechanism was quantified from the kinematics of the greater trochanter, correlation between kinetic and gravitational potential energy of the centre of body mass obtained from the force plate recordings, and percentage of recovery of mechanical energy. In toddlers, these parameters deviated significantly (P< 10 - 5) from those of older children and adults, indicating that the pendulum mechanism is not implemented at the onset of unsupported locomotion. <b>Normalising</b> the <b>speed</b> with the Froude number showed that the percentage of recovery of mechanical energy in children older than 2 years was roughly {{similar to that of the}} adults (less than 5 % difference), in agreement with previous results. By contrast, the percentage of recovery in toddlers was much lower (by about 50 %). Pendulum-like behaviour and fixed coupling of the angular motion of the lower limb segments rapidly co-evolved toward mature values within a few months of independent walking experience. Independent walking experience acts as a functional trigger of the developmental changes, as shown by the observation that gait parameters remained unchanged until the age of the first unsupported steps, and then rapidly matured after that age. The findings suggest that the pendulum mechanism is not an inevitable mechanical consequence of a system of linked segments, but requires active neural control and an appropriate pattern of inter-segmental coordination...|$|R

Head and trunk accelerations in eight young subjects (aged 23 ᴠyears) and eight healthy elderly subjects (aged 74 ᳠years) were measured during level walking on a 20 m walkway using a pair of tri-axial accelerometers. Heel contact and toe-off events were determined using a footswitch system embedded in the innersole of the right shoe. Gait measures assessed included; stride, stance and swing durations, cadence, gait velocity, step length and 3 D head and trunk accelerations. All acceleration variables were <b>normalised</b> to walking <b>speed</b> before statistical analysis. The main findings of this study were: (1) the peak positive anterior-posterior (AP) trunk acceleration associated with push-off was significantly lower for elderly subjects, (2) the peak negative AP head and trunk accelerations following heel contact was significantly higher for elderly subjects, and (3) the time delay between trunk and head accelerations experienced in the AP direction was significantly lower for the elderly compared to the young group. Together, these results suggest that elderly subjects exhibit different patterns of upper body motion in the direction of travel compared to younger subjects. These differences are probably motivated by the need to maximise dynamic stability during critical parts of the gait cycle. No Full Tex...|$|R

Twelve cases were studied with combinations of solar, wind and hydro power both with and without storage possibilities. A system with only wind as power source has a higher overall availability than one with only solar power. But since all the solar power is available during daytime the availability is higher for solar power during daytime. By adding storage capability the overall availability will be higher for solar power because more efficient use of the storage. Combining the power sources with small hydro power (only 10 % of total maximum load) the availability will be significantly increased. The hydro power will then supply the load during low load hours. A combination of all three power sources gives a high reliability because during the high daytime load all three sources are available and during nighttime both wind and hydro are available. The largest availability problems are during mornings and evenings when the load is high but the solar power has a low availability. This effect is season dependent.

In particular the so called Bora, a gusty wind from north to north-east. One goal of the campaign was to examine the performance of SODAR and LIDAR instruments under harsh meteorological conditions. Both, SODAR and LIDAR showed very good perform-ance with high data availability up to 100 m. Vertical {{profiles of}} wind speed showed only small increase with height for the prevailing wind directions north north-east and south south-east. Turbulence intensities calculated from SODAR and LIDAR measurements showed different values as a result of different sampling rates. However both data sets revealed almost constant turbulence intensities between 30 m and 100 m above ground. Turbu-lence intensities remained below class A of the IEC 61400. For comparison the vertical profiles of WindSim, SODAR and LIDAR measurements were normalised to 50 m for all twelve 30 ° wind direction sectors. The <b>normalised</b> vertical wind <b>speed</b> profiles of SODAR, LIDAR and WindSim showed good agreement especially for the prevailing wind directions. Turbulence intensities calculated by Wind-Sim show a weak decrease with height in contrary to the almost constant vertical turbulence intensity profiles of the SODAR and LIDAR measurements...|$|R
40|$|Convective downburst wind storms {{generate}} the peak annual {{gust wind speed}} for {{many parts of the}} non-cyclonic world at return periods of importance for ultimate limit state design. Despite this there is little clear understanding of how to appropriately design for these wind events given their significant dissimilarities to boundary layer winds upon which most design is based. To enhance the understanding of wind fields associated with these storms a three-dimensional numerical model was developed to simulate a multitude of idealised downburst scenarios and to investigate their near-ground wind characteristics. Stationary and translating downdraft wind events in still and sheared environments were simulated with baseline results showing good agreement with previous numerical work and full-scale observational data. Significant differences are shown in the <b>normalised</b> peak wind <b>speed</b> velocity profiles depending on the environmental wind conditions {{in the vicinity of the}} simulated event. When integrated over the height of mid- to high rise structures, all simulated profiles are shown to produce wind loads smaller than an equivalent 10 m height matched open terrain boundary layer profile. This suggests that for these structures the current design approach is conservative from an ultimate loading standpoint. Investigating the influence of topography on the structure of the simulated near-ground downburst wind fields, it is shown that these features amplify wind speeds in a manner similar to that expected for boundary layer winds, but the extent of amplification is reduced. The level of reduction is shown to be dependent on the depth of the simulated downburst outflow. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{turbulent}} lifted slot-jet flame is studied using direct {{numerical simulation}} (DNS). A one- step chemistry model is employed with a mixture-fraction dependent activation energy which can reproduce qualitatively the dependence of laminar burning rate on equivalence ratio that is typical of hydrocarbon fuels. The qualitative structure of the flame is first examined, confirming some features that have previously been observed in experimental measurements {{as well as some}} which have not been previously discussed. Significant differences are observed comparing the present DNS representing a hydrocarbon fuel, and previous DNS representing hydrogen fuel. The statistics of flow and relative edge-flame propagation velocity components conditioned on the leading edge-flame locations are then examined. The results show that on average, the streamwise flame propagation and streamwise flow balance, thus demonstrating that edge-flame propagation is the basic stabilisation mechanism. Fluctuations of the edge locations and velocities are, however, significant. It is demonstrated that the edges tend to move in an essentially two-dimensional elliptical pattern (laterally outwards towards the oxidiser, then upstream, then inwards towards the fuel, then downstream again). It is proposed that {{this is due to the}} passage of large eddies, as outlined in Su et al. [1]. However, the mechanism is not entirely two-dimensional, and out-of-plane motion is needed to explain how flames escape the high velocity inner region of the jet. Next, the time-averaged structure is examined. The entrainment flow is shown to be diverted around the flame base causing locally upstream streamwise velocities. A budget of terms in the transport equation for product mass fraction is used to understand the stabilisation from a time-averaged perspective. It is found to be consistent with the instantaneous perspective, featuring a fundamentally two-dimensional structure involving upstream trans- port of products on the lean side balanced by entrainment into richer conditions, while on the rich side, upstream turbulent transport and entrainment from leaner conditions balance the streamwise convection. A complete analysis of the reasons behind the observed trends in the flame relative propagation velocity has been performed. The mean <b>normalised</b> edge-flame <b>speed</b> is less than laminar flame speed (at around 0. 6 of laminar flame speed) and the edge-flame velocity fluctuations are mainly connected with strain rates, scalar dissipation rate, mixture-fraction curvature, product mass fraction curvature and the inner product. These quantities as well as the average normal orientations and nature of the flame in terms of categorisation of the edge as premixed or non-premixed go through cyclic fluctuations which appear to be connected with the passage of large eddies and the elliptical pattern of the on-average motion. Overall the results provide strong support for the edge-flame theory of flame stabilisation, but point to significant roles played by large, coherent eddies in determining fluctuations of both the flow velocities and edge-flame relative propagation velocities, and thus the lifted height...|$|R
40|$|Farshid Amirabdollahian, Michael Walter, Rory Heffernan, Sarah Fletcher, and Phil Webb, ???Using myoelectric signals for gesture detection: a {{feasibility}} study???. Paper {{presented at}} the Ergonomics and Human Factors 2017 Conference, 25 ??? 27 April 2017, Daventry, United Kingdom. Abstract The propose {{of this study was}} to assess the feasibility of using myoelectric signals acquired using an off the shelf device, the Myo armband from Thalmic Lab. Background: With the technological advances in sensing human motion, and its potential to drive and control mechanical interfaces remotely, a multitude of input mechanisms are used to link actions between the human and the robot. In this study we explored the feasibility of using human arm???s myoelectric signals with the aim of identifying a number of gestures automatically. Material and methods: Participants (n = 26) took part in a study with the aim to assess the gesture detection accuracy using myoelectric signals. The Myo armband was used worn on the forearm. The session was divided into three phases, familiarisation: where participant learned how to use the armband, training: when participants reproduced a number of requested gestures to train our machine learning algorithm and recognition: when gestures presented on screen where reproduced by participants, and simultaneously recognised using the machine learning routines. Results: One participant did not complete the study due to technical errors during the session. The remaining (n = 25) participants completed the study allowing to calculate individual accuracy for grasp detection using this medium. Our overall accuracy was 65. 06 %, with the cylindrical grasp achieving the highest accuracy of around 7. 20 % and the tripod grasp achieving lowest recognition accuracy of 60. 15 %. Discussions: The recognition accuracy for the grasp performed is significantly lower compared to our earlier work where a mechatronic device was used. This could be due to the choice of grasps for this study, as it is not ideal to the placement of the armband. While tripod, cylindrical and lateral grasps have different finger and wrist articulations, their demand on supporting forearm muscles (mainly biceps and triceps) is less definite and therefore their myoelectric signals are less distinct. Furthermore, drop in accuracy could be caused by the fact that human muscles and consequently the myoelectric signals are substantially variable over time. Muscles change their relative intensity based on the speed of the produced gesture. In our earlier study, the gesture production speed was damped by the worn orthosis, leading to <b>normalising</b> the <b>speed</b> of gestures. This is while in our current study, hand motion is not restricted. Despite these, the recognition accuracy is still significant. Future work: There are remaining questions related to the feasibility of using myoelectric signals as an input to a remote controlled robot in a factory floor as it is anticipated that such a system would enhance control and efficiency in production processes. These questions therefore require further investigations regarding usability of the armband in its intended context, to ensure users are able to effectively control and manipulate the robot using the myoelectric system and enjoy a positive user experience. Future studies will focus on the choice of gestures, so that they are distinct and better identifiable, but also on other key human factors and system design features that will enhance performance, in compliance with relevant standards such as ISO 9241 - 210 : 2010 (standards for human-system interaction ergonomic design principles). Furthermore, aspects of whether a machine learning algorithm should use individually learned events in order to recognise an individual???s gestures, or if it is possible to use normative representation of a substantial set of learnt events, to achieve higher accuracy remains an interesting area for our future work...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to examine {{measurement}} properties of three outcome measures of motor function for children with cerebral palsy (CP), and to investigate change in their motor functioning following three weeks of intensive, activity-focused and goal-directed physiotherapy in a group setting. A portable electronic walkway has been found feasible and reliable when measuring gait parameters in adults with neurological disorders and in children with typical development, but measurement properties of the assessment tool have not been examined in children with CP. Test-retest reliability of gait parameters from the electronic walkway was investigated in 17 children with CP. A defined procedure to calculate speed dependent gait parameters at a <b>normalised</b> gait <b>speed</b> was used. In a short time span, the electronic walkway {{was found to be}} highly reliable for assessing gait parameters in children with CP. A subsequent study examined the inter-observer and intra-observer reliability of two quality of movement measures when scored from video clips. Quality of movement measures can be challenging and time consuming to score in a clinical setting due to the complexity of the construct. The impact of quality of movement on motor development has been sparsely investigated, but good quality is presumed by many professionals to increase efficiency and safety of activities and decrease efforts in children with CP. Hence an efficient way of assessing quality of movement seems important. Twenty-six children with CP participated in a reliability testing of the Gross Motor Performance Measure (GMPM) and the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST). Performance of the test items were videotaped, edited and independently scored by two assessors on two occasions. The intra-observer and inter-observer reliability of the total scores of the two measures were found satisfactory, and the total scores can thus be recommended for research use. Reliability, however, was not satisfactory for the sub-scales and single items, and cannot be recommended for use as separate measures. The above three measures quantify different aspects of motor functioning in children with CP and were found to be reliable and feasible for use in clinical research, including research carried out as multicentre studies. There is little scientific knowledge about the optimal type, dosage and onset of physiotherapy for children with cerebral palsy. Recent work has indicated that more intensive, goal-directed and functional training than commonly offered by physiotherapists might be beneficial. Furthermore, there is little knowledge about the impact of movement quality on motor development in children with CP. The third study investigated change of motor functioning in children with CP who participated in intensive, activity-focused and goal-directed physiotherapy in a group setting for the first time. Twenty-two children aged three to nine years in five training groups from different places in Western Norway participated in the study. A repeated measures design was applied with three baseline measurements before and two follow up measurements after the intervention. The intervention aimed to attain individual goals regarding basic motor abilities and motor abilities in everyday activities, and consisted of three hours of physiotherapy, five days a week for a three-week period. After the intervention period, the children had gained significant improvements in basic motor abilities assessed by the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) and high attainment of predetermined individual goals was found. The children’s parents reported significant improvement in the children’s ability to perform self-care activities in the home environments and a decreased need for caregiver assistance in mobility and self-care activities assessed by the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI). A positive trend in improved quality of movement as measured by the Gross Motor Performance Measure (GMPM) and Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST) was revealed, but not statistically significant. A significant improvement in movement quality was found in items of the GMFM which improved during the study period, but not in items that reminded stable. Thus, acquisition of gross motor functions seemed to be related to better quality of movement, however, {{more research is needed to}} substantiate this observation. The intensive physiotherapy training in a group setting was experienced as fun and motivating, even though the children and their families also found the training period strenuous. Defined periods of intensive, focused training to attain specific goals seem to be a feasible way of optimising motor functioning in children with CP...|$|R
40|$|Research, {{diagnosis}} and intervention in ADHD {{has been plagued}} by problems of definitionof the disorder, vagueness surrounding constructs held to be central to the disorder such as 2 ̆ 7 attention deficit 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 sustained attention 2 ̆ 7, and limitations of diagnostic instruments loosely linked to such constructs (Douglas, 1980; Schachar, 1991; Corkum 2 ̆ 6 Siegel, 1993). Literature is reviewed which demonstrates the need, in both research and clinical work ADHD, for comprehensive theories of attentional dysfunction in these children as well asfor objective research and diagnostic instruments which are clearly grounded in such theories. To address these issues, a review is conducted of promising models of ADHD dysfunction followed by recent understanding of attentional processes based on two parallel visual systems known as the magnocellular (or transient) and parvocellular (sustained) systems (Breitmeyer, 1994). Recently, the implications of these systems to attention have been explored along with their potential application to attention disorders (Williams, Lettell,Reinoso 2 ̆ 6 Greve, 1994). It is argued that an abnormality of the transient system may be involved in ADHD dysfunction and a tentative model is proposed which links the transient system to matching processes in the hippo campus, the dorsal attention system, and to regulation of sensory and motor processes in the frontal regions of the brain. It is then argued that a paradigm capable of exploring the hypothesis of transient abnormality in ADHD is that used extensively to date in research into specific reading disability and more recently in schizophrenia research, namely visual masking. Visual masking, and particularly paradigms such as metacontrast, can be interpreted in terms of interaction between M and P pathways and therefore can be used to examine the hypothesisthat an M cell/transient system abnormality contributes to ADHD dysfunction. The current research therefore sought to explore, using visual masking paradigms, evidence for such anabnormality and incorporate findings into a model of ADHD dysfunction which is more inclusive than those reviewed. Experiment 1 sought to investigate preliminary evidence for an abnormal visual masking function in ADHD children. A sample of children aged between 9 and 11 years with a diagnosis of ADHD were matched for age, sex and IQ with two comparison samples of children, one meeting criteria for learning disability (LD) but not ADHD and the other, a normal control sample. The experiment showed evidence for abnormal visual masking in both clinical groups. Experiment 2, using the same samples and a metacontrast paradigm, sought to examine more specifically the possible involvement of abnormal transient channel activity in ADHD children. The study indicated an abnormality in relative response speed but not magnitude of transient channels in ADHD children, with evidence for abnormally fast transient channel responses in these children. In Experiment 3, the same metacontrast procedure was used to examine transient/sustained channel interaction in an ADHD sample when 2 ̆ 7 on 2 ̆ 7 versus 2 ̆ 7 off stimulant medication. Stimulants appeared to <b>normalise</b> the response <b>speed</b> of transient channels in ADHD subjects. Results from the three experiments tended to confirm the model of ADHD dysfunction proposed from an integration of the literature and the model was then further elaborated. The capacity of the model for explaining characteristic symptoms of ADHD was then discussed. Finally, the potential of visual masking and other paradigms reflecting transient/sustained functioning for researching ADHD and for diagnostic purposes was noted...|$|R
