From 1985 and until the EU ban, the Faroe Islands and Norway (which are not members of the EU) were allowed annual quotas of 200 tons and 125 tons respectively from European Community waters. Although these quotas were lower than the originals set in 1982 (500 tons for Norway and 300 tons for the Faroe Islands), they were still consistently higher than the yearly total porbeagle catch {{in the region and}} thus had no practical effect. The species is included on the red list of Norway and it has been protected in their <b>national</b> <b>waters</b> since 2012. Any porbeagle caught in EU or Norwegian waters by accident must be released.|$|E

This law also provided for water ownership and use. No special provisions for groundwater were made under this law. Chapter 8 of the 1927 law outlines in fifteen articles how the water of a Honduras shall be used for irrigation. Special note to irrigation is also made in Chapter 3, Art. 10, and Chapter 5, Art. 25 which lists an order of preference for how <b>national</b> <b>waters</b> should be used. Irrigation is listed third after domestic and railway supply respectively.|$|E

The State of Honduras is working on a new General Water Law to replace the 1927 Law on Using <b>National</b> <b>Waters</b> and designed to regulate water use and management. The new water law will also create a Water Authority, and the National Council of Water Resources which will serve as an advising and consultative body.|$|E
25|$|Unit Gempur Marin (UNGERIN) (Marine Combat Unit) was {{established}} in 2006 and it was fully operational {{by the end of}} 2007 with the first name as the Unit Selam Tempur due to the pressing need to suppress the pirate attacks alongside the coastal area of Malacca Straits and open sea area of South China Sea which were continuously widespread from time to time despite various efforts done to overcome the problem. The members received special training from the United States after realising the need to form a special unit to secure the <b>national</b> <b>waters</b> and riverine fronts from any untoward incidents. This unit is placed under formation Marine Police Branch which is based in the Marine Police Base at Kampung Aceh, Sitiawan, Perak and Lahad Datu, Sabah. It has a big role in handling threats from pirates, robbery, kidnapping and hijacking of ships and terrorist attacks in <b>national</b> <b>waters.</b> The 30 members of UNGERIN are trained by instructors from US Navy SEALs and US Coast Guard in Langkawi and Kota Kinabalu and are armed with special weaponry, such as Glock 19, MP5 and Colt M4A1 (possibly supported by the United States) and utilise maritime anti-terrorist tactics employed by the units of United States Navy commandos. For the unit's restructuring, the name of UST was changed to Unit Gempur Marin or UNGERIN in the year 2008. Its eventual goal is to have 200 operators on standby with UNGERIN.|$|E
25|$|The 1927 Law on Using <b>National</b> <b>Waters</b> (Ley Vigente de Aprovechamiento de Aguas Nacionales) was a {{major step}} for Honduras in water {{resource}} management (WRM). This law however, did not recognize multi-sectoral uses of water, therefore, water use in each WRM sector became regulated by their own respective sectoral law. Furthermore, major institutions such as SANAA, CONASA, and ERSAPS have operational functions in both water and sanitation services. As of August 2009, Honduras has passed a new General Water Law with a National Water Authority to provide regulation and oversight to institutions responsible for distinct sectors of water resource management. The General Water Law is discussed below.|$|E

Consequently, he decided against staying at the holdings of the Kingdom of Portugal and avoided the Cape Verde Islands. After sailing down the coast of West Africa, the Tonquin made way for South America. Off the coast of Argentina an extreme storm struck, ruining many of the sails and adding two additional leaks in the hull. As the voyage continued on, the freshwater supplies dwindled to three gills a day per sailing member.|$|E

The next major water resources policy measures were signed in 2003 as the Water Framework Law which, among many aspects, aims to reduce poverty through better water resources management. In August 2009, a new General Water Law was passed to replace the 1927 water law. Within the new water law a National Water Authority was created to oversee the work of sector institutions[...]|$|E

The <b>National</b> <b>Water</b> Account is Australia’s most comprehensive water information report. It provides information on nine significant water use regions across Australia. It discloses information about water stores and flows, water rights and <b>water</b> use. The <b>National</b> <b>Water</b> Account reports on the volumes of water traded, extracted and managed for economic, social, cultural and environmental purposes. Why are we doing it? Through the Water Act 2007, the Bureau has statutory responsibility for compiling and delivering comprehensive water information across Australia. Water information is a critical underpinning of the water reform process both {{on which to base}} decisions and against which to measure progress. The <b>National</b> <b>Water</b> Account provides information that previously was difficult to access or unavailable to general users in a standardised form. In doing so it supports the achievement of the water accounting objective of the <b>National</b> <b>Water</b> Initiative, which is to improve the measurement, monitoring and reporting of water. What is new? Water accounting is a new concept in water resources management. The <b>National</b> <b>Water</b> Account breaks new ground by taking a national and standards-based approach to water resource reporting. The compilation of the <b>National</b> <b>Water</b> Account is guided by the Australian Water Accounting Standard 1 (1. 83 MB) which prescribes the components of a water accounting report.
