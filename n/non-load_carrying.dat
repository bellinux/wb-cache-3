40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the bone tissue response at the interface of loaded and non-loaded implants {{used in an}} orthopedic anchorage system after a continuous, non-axial force application of 5 N over 2 months. Materials and Methods: Twenty-nine Branemark System implants {{were placed in the}} Zygomatic arches of 5 dogs. After a healing period of 8 weeks, 20 implants (4 in each dog) were loaded during 8 weeks with a large non-axial orthopedic force application of 5 N. This force was directed between the implants and a maxillary splint to move the maxilla forward. Nine implants were not loaded during this period. At the termination of the experiment, all 29 implants were retrieved for radiographic as well as for histologic analysis. Computer-based histomorphometric quantifications were performed via light microscopy and computer software. Bone-metal contact (BMC), bone surface area (BSA) inside the threads, and the bone mirror area (BMA) of the implants were measured. Statistical comparisons between the loaded and <b>non-loaded</b> implants were <b>carried</b> out. In the group of loaded implants a 2 -factor analysis of variance was used. Results: There were no statistically significant differences found in BMC, BSA, and BMA between the loaded and non-loaded implants, both for all the threads and for only the cervical region of the implants. Nor were there statistically significant differences between the non-pressure and pressure sides or for different lengths of the loaded implants. Discussion: The loaded implants maintained the osseointegration achieved during the 8 -week healing period. Conclusions: The results {{of this study indicate that}} titanium implants can be used as anchorage for orthopedic force application systems...|$|R

Fatigue test results were presented by both a nominal stress based approach and a more refined structural stress based approach for the as-welded joints.

The two approaches are applied to load carrying and <b>non-load</b> <b>carrying</b> cruciform joints and the theoretical fatigue notch factors Kf are compared.

However, the correct identification of the loading path in terms of uniaxial or multi-axial stress states, proportional or non-proportional loading is essential because these factors can significantly alter the material response. In this study, finite element analysis was conducted to assess the fatigue crack initiation life of a <b>non-load</b> <b>carrying</b> fillet joint by considering weld bead shape and a cyclic plasticity accumulation during fatigue loading, which is a main cause of crack initiation. Cyclic plasticity behaviour including cyclic hardening and softening together was investigated with an unconventional plasticity model called the subloading surface model and extended to include both elastic boundary and cyclic damage concepts.

40|$|Abstract. Welded {{structures}} are frequently used in today’s metal industry. Since fatigue {{is still one}} major reason of failures, investigation in this field is of interest to engineers. In this study experimental methods are employed to perform a fatigue evaluation concerning local weld geometry.

Each batch contained 12 specimens manufactured in cruciform joint and has been tested in <b>non-load</b> <b>carrying</b> status. Finally, the results of tests were compiled in Wöhler (S-N) curve and compared to reference curves introduced by IIW (International Institute of Welding).

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} scale effect in {{relatively}} thin welded joints subjected to fatigue loading. In scientific literature, the fatigue behaviour of arc welded joints is usually {{divided into two}} groups: thick and thin joints. A cut-off thickness, typically {{in the range of}} 13 mm to 22 mm, is introduced; under such cut-off value the design fatigue strength does not increase by decreasing thickness. Despite this common approach, in the present paper, by means of the implicit gradient method, the concept of cut-off thickness is revised and a single numerical procedure is proposed regardless of the thickness of the joint. In particular, classical <b>non-load</b> <b>carrying</b> and load carrying cruciform joints made of steel are considered in the numerical analysis. On the basis of many experimental comparisons, the implicit gradient approach seems able to capture the fatigue strength of welded joints also when only a few millimeters in thickness. Furthermore, in the case of load carrying cruciform joints, by scaling the weld geometry, it is discussed when the failure initiation site moves from the weld toe to the root and vice versa {{as a function of the}} thickness...|$|E

The Fatigue Life of welded structures is still in need for improvement. The sheer number of Fatigue Live Improvement Techniques parameters leads to the need of simulating and predicting their results. For this study, two different materials were used, an Austenitic Stainless Steel and a Duplex Stainless Steel. <b>Non-load</b> <b>carrying</b> cruciform weld joints were produced and fatigue tested, with and without the Hammer Peening treatment. Finally a FEA code (ABAQUS®) was used to simulate the Hammer Peening technique. A fully dynamic model was used, combined with the Chaboche Kinematic-hardening material model and different Hammering parameter experimentally determined. Alongside the residual stresses introduced by the Hammer Peening Technique, the predicted Fatigue Life using the FEA model were compared with the experimental results, showing a very good agreement between them. Also the effect of several parameters, like the hammering impact load, the hammer positioning or the number of hammering passages, were analysed as a way to validate the FEA model.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{orthotropic}} deck structures of existing bridges {{are suffering from}} fatigue cracks. Maintenance of these deck structures may consist of regular inspections and repair of detected cracks. The usual fatigue design life procedure for aswelded structures based on S-N curves is not feasible for determining the remaining fatigue life after inspection, because S-N curves only give information on the entire fatigue life. An assessment procedure dedicated to determine the residual fatigue life is the fatigue fracture mechanics method, which starts from an initial defect and predicts the growth of this defect to a critical size. The initial defect may be a small crack detected during an inspection, or an inspection threshold value in case no crack was detected. This paper provides approximate stress intensity factors (geometric correction factors) for crack locations in continuous stringer to crossbeam joints with cope holes, which forms essential information for a fracture mechanics assessment. The stress intensity factors are based on existing stress intensity factors for semi-elliptical surface flaws, corner flaws, through thickness flaws, <b>non-load</b> <b>carrying</b> welds and load carrying fillet welds.

40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} for {{extending}} the applicability of structural stress method for fatigue assessment of welded structures is discussed. The structural stress method for plate structures, as currently presented in commonly used design guidance documents, cannot account the effect of weld size and load carrying fillet welds are assessed using a different S-N curve as compared to <b>non-load</b> <b>carrying</b> fillet welds. The current proposal is to linearize the local stress distribution through the plate thickness in {{the plane of the}} weld toe and, thus, partially capture the local effect. A bilinear stress distribution is derived from the actual non-linear stress distribution based on equilibrium. A simple procedure is presented to determine the bilinear curve from the nominal weld stress. This is a great advantage in finite element analysis when only nominal base plate stress and nominal weld stresses need to be determined. The same weld stresses can be used also in the analysis of the root cracks. The proposed method was scaled to correspond to the traditional structural stress method using detailed linear elastic fracture mechanics simulations. The method is here applied only to fully load-carrying welds but can also be used for partial load-carrying welds. A symmetric splice plate having a fully loaded fillet weld is presented as an example case. The influence of base plate thickness is also studied. ...|$|E
40|$|Local fatigue {{assessment}} methods like the structural hot spot stress and effective notch stress methods {{as defined by}} the International Institute of Welding are widely used by design engineers and researchers to assess the fatigue strength of welded components. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of published data for welded joints which had been improved using high frequency mechanical impact (HFMI) treatment. All of the published data for HFMI-treated welds are presented in terms of nominal stress. The goal of the current paper is to establish local {{fatigue assessment}} procedures for improved fillet welds. In total, 160 published experimental results for longitudinal and cruciform welds subjected to R = 0. 1 axial loading are evaluated. Local stress quantities for each joint were assessed based on the finite element analyses and reported nominal stress values. A correction procedure for yield strength that was previously verified for nominal stress-based fatigue assessment is also applied to the local stress methods studied in this paper. For both the structural hot spot stress and effective notch stress methods, sets of characteristic fatigue strength curves as functions of yield strength are proposed and verified. The structural hot spot stress method includes one set of fatigue strength curves for load-carrying welds and a second set for <b>non-load</b> <b>carrying</b> welds. The effective notch stress method includes a single set of curves for all welds. All of the design curves proposed in this study are conservative with respect to available fatigue test data...|$|E

Little {{research has been done}} on the fatigue of thin-walled tubular sections below 4 mm thickness. The weld profile and weld undercut may affect the fatigue crack propagation life of welded joints especially for thin-walled sections. Numerical analysis of 2 -dimensional <b>non-load</b> <b>carrying</b> thin-walled cruciform joints was performed to determine the effect of weld profile and weld undercut on fatigue crack propagation life under cyclic tensile loading. The cruciform joints analysed are made up of 3 mm thick plates, joined by fillet welds. The Boundary Element Analysis System Software (BEASY) is used, which uses fracture mechanics theory to carry out crack propagation analysis. The weld profiles and weld undercuts were measured from welded connections in thin-walled fillet welded sections. The measured weld profiles and undercut were used in the analysis. The results are compared with those of a similar study to determine the comparative reduction in fatigue crack propagation life between thin-walled cruciform joints (T= 3 mm) and thicker walled cruciform joints (T= 20 mm).

40|$|It is {{commonly}} observed that complex fabricated structures subject to fatigue loading fail at the welded joints. Some {{problems can be}} corrected by proper detail design but fatigue performance can also be improved using post-weld improvement methods. In general, improvement methods {{can be divided into}} two main groups: weld geometry modification methods and residual stress modification methods. The former remove weld toe defects and/or reduce the stress concentration while the latter introduce compressive stress fields in the area where fatigue cracks are likely to initiate. The ultrasonic impact treatment method belongs to the class of residual stress improvement methods. The method makes use of an ultrasonic carrier frequency to accelerate hardened tools that, in turn, impact the weld toe. The fatigue strength of <b>non-load</b> <b>carrying</b> attachments in the as-welded condition has been experimentally compared to the fatigue strength of ultrasonic impact treated welds. Longitudinal attachment specimens made of two thicknesses of steel S 355 J 0 have been tested for determining the efficiency of ultrasonic impact treatment.

40|$|Fillet welded {{connections}} are most commonly {{for construction of}} marine structures that are often subjected to various forms of cyclic loading in service. Due to its complexity in stress concentration, today’s fatigue design rules are empirical and mostly based on test data from 1970 ’s, often resulting in significantly oversized welds or overwelding. As structural lightweighting becomes increasingly important, there is an urgent need for more quantitative fatigue-based fillet weld sizing criterion. In this work, {{by taking advantage of}} recent developments in mesh-insensitive method for dealing with stress singularity at weld root and weld toe, a closed-form weld throat traction stress solution has then been developed for analytically determining weld throat stress state as a function of weld throat plane angle. This closed form solution enables a formulation of an equivalent traction stress parameter {{that can be used to}} determine the critical fillet weld size that separates weld root failure mode from weld toe failure mode. In dealing with fatigue test specimens produced in representative shipyard production environment, it is found that both weld penetration and joint misalignments must be taking into account in order to effectively interpret fatigue test data generated as a part of this study. Along this line, the analytical traction stress method developed is further expanded to take into account of weld penetration and joint misalignments. In the latter, a series of new analytical solutions for calculating stress concentration factors caused by joint misalignments are developed. With these new developments, analytically determined fatigue failure mode transition in terms of relative weld fillet size with respect to base plate thickness is proposed and validated by fatigue test data. Then, a quantitative weld sizing is proposed based on a detailed data analysis through a logistic regression method. Aluminum fillet-welded cruciform specimens are also considered for confirming the applicability of the failure mode transition criteria developed based on steel weldments. <b>Non-load</b> <b>carrying</b> fillet-welded cruciform specimens are also tested and analyzed using the traction stress method for developing baseline information for supporting the development of fatigue design curve for titanium hull structures...|$|E

The former remove weld toe defects and/or reduce the stress concentrationwhile the latter introduce compressive stress fields in the area where fatigue cracks are likely to initiate. Ultrasonic impact treatment (UIT) is a novel post-weld treatment method that influences both the residual stress distribution andimproves the local geometry of the weld. The structural fatigue strength of <b>non-load</b> <b>carrying</b> attachments in the as-welded condition has been experimentally compared to the structural fatigue strength of ultrasonic impact treated welds. Longitudinal attachment specimens made of two thicknesses of steel S 355 J 0 have been tested for determining the efficiency of ultrasonic impacttreatment. Treated welds were found to have about 50 % greater structural fatigue strength, when the slope of the S-N-curve is three. High mean stress fatigue testing based on the Ohta-method decreased the degree of weld improvement only 19 %. This indicated that the method could be also applied for large fabricated structures operating under high reactive residual stresses equilibrated within the volume of the structure. The thickness of specimens has no significant effect tothe structural fatigue strength. The fatigue class difference between 5 mm and 8 mm specimen was only 8 %. It was hypothesized that the UIT method added a significant crack initiation period to the total fatigue life of the welded joints. Crack initiation life was estimated by a local strain approach. Material parameters were defined using a modified Uniform Material Law developed in Germany. Finite element analysis and X-ray diffraction were used to define, respectively, the stress concentration and mean stress. The theoretical fatigue life was found to have good accuracy comparing to experimental fatigue tests.

40|$|To {{improve the}} usage of {{material}} in fatigue loaded complex welded structures a better calculation method (based on FEA) is needed than what {{is available on the}} market and an improved management of weld quality. Improved FE-procedures are directly applicable to design of generic structural components within virtually all industries using CAD and FEtools, irrespective of industrial sector. More and more welded structures are created as 3 D models from the design offices and the FE-work will be easier but the requirement of being accurate from the beginning and the reduction of lead times create a great need to substantially reduce calculation time. The main objectives in this thesis is to develop novel procedures to extract design data from finite element stress analyses of complex fatigue loaded welded structures, to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} limits of the different fatigue design methods and to investigate the influence of fatigue strength due to the weld quality. An investigation of how weld geometry and different type of defects influence fatigue life of the weld has been made on a <b>non-load</b> <b>carrying</b> cruciform joint. The weld geometries were measured and the stress distributions were computed using FEA. Fatigue tests have been performed and the initial defects were analysed.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to promote the use of G. R. P. as a structural material. In the past, the use of G. R. P. has been confined to <b>non-load</b> <b>carrying</b> applications. Such uses are still rapidly increasing but in addition significant changes have been made during the last decade in the development of semi-structural and now even fully structural applications. Glass-reinforced plastic is characterized by a high strength but a relatively low modulus of elasticity. For this reasona G. R. P. structure can expect to show large deformations as a result of which the individual structural members will fail under load due to a loss of stability rather than approaching the ultimate strength of the material. For this reason the selection of the geometrical shapes of G. R. P. structural elements is considered to be an important factor in designing G. R. P. structures. The first chapter of this thesis deals with a general review of the theoretical and experimental methods used to describe the structural properties of G. R. P. The research programme includes five stages dealing with the structural behaviour of G. R. P. The first stage (Chapter 2) begins with selecting and designing an optimum box beam cross-section which gives the maximum flexural and torsional rigidity. The second stage of investigation (Chapter 3) deals with beam to beam connections. A joint was designed and manufactured with different types of fasteners used to connect two beam units. A suitable fastener was selected and the research extended to cover the behaviour of long span beams using multiple joints. The third part of the investigation includes a study of the behaviour of box beams subjected to combined bending, shear and torsion. A special torque rig was developed to perform the tests. Creep deformation of 6 m span G. R. P. was investigated as the fourth stage under a range of loading conditions. As a result of the phenomenon of post buckling behaviour exhibited in the compression flange during testing of box beams during earlier stages of the investigation it was decided to consider this phenomenon in more detail in the final stage of the investigation. G. R. P. plates with different fibre orientation were subjected to uniaxial compression and tested up to failure.

40|$|With {{superior}} oxidation and corrosion resistance, {{metallic coatings}} (i. e. diffusion coatings and MCrAlX coatings) {{are widely used}} to protect hot components made of superalloys in turbine engines. Two issues are critically important for the coating at high temperatures: thermal property related to oxidation/corrosion behavior and microstructure stability, and mechanical properties (e. g. creep and fatigue). The aim of this project is to develop {{better understanding of the}} thermal and mechanical behaviors of metallic coatings on superalloys and to improve the accuracy of prediction of their lifetime by thermodynamic modeling. The present work includes an investigation on the oxidation behavior of MCrAlX coating with a new lifetimeprediction model and a study on the influence of diffusion coatings on creep and fatigue behaviors of the superalloy IN 792. Experiments on isothermal and thermal cycling oxidation were designed to investigate the oxidation behavior of a HVOF CoNiCrAlYSi coating on superalloy IN 792. It is found that the oxidation behaviors of the coating are related to its thermodynamic property. A diffusion model has been established using the homogenization models in the DICTRA software and taking into consideration of the influence of surface oxidation, coating-substrate interdiffusion and diffusion blocking effect caused by internal voids and oxides. The simulation results show an improved accuracy of lifetime prediction by introducing the diffusion blocking effect. Microstructural evolution during creep process at high temperatures was studied in different diffusion coatings (NiAl and PtAl). It is found that the inward diffusion of aluminum controls the thickening rate of the diffusion coatings. The developed coatings displayed two types of mechanical behavior - being easily plasticized or cracked - dependent on temperature and type of coating, and therefore could be considered as <b>non-load</b> <b>carrying</b> material during creep test. The influence of cracking of PtAl coating on the high-cycle fatigue (HCF) behavior of the IN 792 was also investigated. The results show that precracking of the coating prior to the fatigue test has little influence on the fatigue limit of specimens with thin coating (50 μm) but lowers the fatigue limit of specimens with thick coating (70 μm). The through-coating crack has enough mobility to penetrate into the substrate and causes fatigue failure only when the driving force for crack propagation is increased above a critical value due to a higher applied stress or a larger crack length (thicker coating).

40|$|This {{doctoral}} {{study is}} concerned with the fatigue strength of welded steel structures which are improved by high frequency mechanical impact (HFMI) treatment. A comprehensive evaluation of 417 HFMI test data obtained from the literature and 24 HFMI fatigue data tested as a part of this work are studied. According to the statistical analyses an S-N slope of five (5) is proposed. A yield strength correction procedure which relates the material yield strength (fy) to fatigue is presented and verified based on the constant amplitude R = 0. 1 axial tension fatigue data. The fy correction method significantly reduced the observed scatter in the data with respect to data without any fy correction. Fatigue strength evaluations are done based on the nominal stress (NS), the structural hot spot stress (SHSS) and the effective notch stress (ENS) methods. By defining a reference fy at 355 MPa, an increase in strength of approximately  12. 5 % for every 200 MPa increase in fy above the reference fy is found. For the NS and SHSS systems, this study gives HFMI design recommendations including a five (5) fatigue class increase in strength with respect to the NS and SHSS fatigue classes for the same weld detail in the as-welded condition. In the case of the ENS, a four (4) fatigue class improvement is proposed and verified. For HFMI welds with fy > 950 MPa, the proposals are extended to represent a stepwise increase up to an eight (8) fatigue class improvement for the NS and the SHSS methods whereas the ENS method leads to a seven (7) fatigue class improvement. All the proposed characteristic curves in this study are conservative with respect to available fatigue test data.  In the experimental study case, longitudinal <b>non-load</b> <b>carrying</b> high strength steel attachments were considered. Specimens were manufactured by a robot using an identical weld procedure and afterwards they were sent to four different HFMI tool manufacturers for post-weld treatment. All improved specimens were tested using the same variable amplitude loading history. Experimental test results indicate that all of the HFMI-improved welds from the four different HFMI equipment manufacturers satisfied the previously-proposed characteristic S-N line based on both the material fy and the specimen geometry. In addition, detailed specimen alignment, weld profile and HFMI groove measurements were done for each specimen. Residual stress measurements were performed on some of the specimens using the X-ray diffraction method. While clear differences were observed, the HFMI groove dimensions and the resulting residual stress state following treatment were generally similar. The goal of the round robin study was to verify that a single guidance could be developed for different HFMI technologies...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{is concerned with}} fatigue life of welded structures. Several topics related to fatigue of welded structures are treated such as; weld defects and their influence on fatigue performance of welded structures, fatigue life prediction using LEFM (Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics), fatigue testing, welding simulation, residual stress prediction and measurement and their influence on fatigue life. The work that is reported in this {{doctoral thesis}} is part results of the Nordic R&D project QFAB (Quality and Cost of Fabricated Advanced Welded Structures) and the Swedish R&D project LOST (Light Optimized Welded Structures). One of the main objectives is to compare different welding processes for the fatigue performance, weld quality and gain understanding of the weld defects, their appearance in different welding processes and their effect on fatigue life. Another main objective is to study welding residual stresses and their effect on fatigue. The design rules are in some cases conservative and especially on the weld root sides the knowledge about the residual stress field may improve the life prediction. The aim is to develop simplified procedures for analysis of residual stresses, their relaxation and influence on fatigue life. Fatigue testing of Hybrid Nd: YAG laser/MAG and MAG welded (tandem arc solid wire, flux cored wire, tandem flux cored wire) <b>non-load</b> <b>carrying</b> cruciform joints was carried out. Four batches were produced, tested {{and the results were}} compared. The local weld geometry of the cruciform welded joints was measured and analyzed. Residual stress measurement was carried out close to the toe region using X-ray diffraction. Weld defects, in most cases cold laps, in the cracked specimens were measured. Further fatigue testing, weld defect assessment and residual stress and local weld geometry measurements were carried out on joints welded with flux cored and metal cored arc wires. Two-and three dimensional LEFM crack growth analysis were carried out in order to predict the influence of weld defects, local weld geometry and residual stresses. Residual stresses in multi-pass welded tube-to-plates were studied for two different tubular joint configurations; a three-pass single-U weld groove for maximum weld penetration and a two-pass fillet (no groove) welded tube-to-plates for minimum weld penetration. Torsion fatigue tests were performed in order to study crack propagation from the weld root. Mode III propagation from the lower and upper weld toe on the same tubular joints was also studied. Some tubes were stress relieved (PWHT) and some were fatigue tested with internal static pressure. A three dimensional finite element welding simulation of the multi-pass welded tubular joint was carried out. The calculated temperatures in the transient thermal analysis were compared with measured temperatures. The FE predicted residual stresses in the as-welded conditions were verified with hole drilling strain gage measurements. The residual stresses were used as internal stresses in the finite element model for the torsion fatigue simulation in order to study the cycle by cycle relaxation of the residual stresses in constant amplitude torsion loading. A two dimensional finite element welding simulation procedure was developed in order to predict welding residual stress. The predicted residual stresses were used together with a developed 2 D LEFM subroutine to predict the fatigue life, crack path and the effect of residual stresses on weld root defects. The developed simulation subroutines were validated with results found in the literature. Residual stresses measurement, two-and three dimensional welding simulations were carried out in fillet welded joints in order to study the three dimensional effects of the welding process, boundary conditions and modelling technique on the formation of residual stresses.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{rehabilitation}} of bridges {{has become a}} critical challenge due to aging {{and an increase in}} traffic loads. Many of these bridges are exceeding their design fatigue life. Since many of these bridges are structurally deficient, they need to be rehabilitated or replaced by a new bridge. The most susceptible and weak parts of steel bridges to cracks and fatigue are the welds, due to the presence of high stress concentrations, tensile residual stresses, and imperfections {{as a result of the}} welding process. Inspection and repair of welds are difficult and elimination of welded details is not possible in steel bridge construction. Ultrasonic impact treatment (UIT) is a promising and innovative post-weld treatment (PWT) method for improving the fatigue performance of existing welded steel and steel-concrete composite structures such as highway bridges. The fatigue resistance of treated joints is enhanced by improving the geometry of the weld toe, and introducing compressive residual stresses. However, a lack of tools for quality assurance has slowed UIT’s adoption by bridge authorities. The current study was undertaken to examine the fatigue performance of structural steel welds subjected to UIT at various levels, including intentional under-treatment and over-treatment, and to relate the fatigue performance of the treated welds to geometric and metallurgical properties measured to control the treatment quality. The last objective was to use the laboratory results to develop acceptance criteria for the quality control of UIT in bridge applications. Fatigue tests of <b>non-load</b> <b>carrying</b> fillet welded attachments were conducted on properly treated, under-treated, and over-treated weld toes. Statistical analyses of the fatigue life data were performed and crack growth was monitored using the alternating current potential drop (ACPD) method. Measurement of local properties (such as weld toe geometry, local hardness, and residual stresses) and examination of the weld toe microstructure were also performed on the untreated and treated welds. The effects of weld toe geometry on the local stresses in the untreated and treated welds were also investigated using elastic finite element analysis (FEA) to obtain the stress concentration factor (SCF) for the different treatment cases and to examine the changes in the SCF for the different weld toe geometries. Based on the statistical analysis performed in this research, the results illustrated that UIT significantly improved the fatigue lives of weld details regardless of the investigated level of treatment quality. The fatigue lives of welded details under constant amplitude (CA) loading and constant amplitude loading with under-loads (CA-UL) were increased up to 30 and 27 times respectively. On average, the fatigue life of the treated weld details was slightly lower under CA-UL than under CA loading. Treatment quality had little impact on the mean of the S-N curves. However, it did impact the design (95 % survival probability) S-N curves, with the curve associated with a proper treatment slightly higher than the curves for poor or unknown treatment quality. Local near-surface microhardness and compressive residual stresses were greatest for the over-treated welded details, followed by the properly treated and then the under-treated welded details. Increasing the treatment speed resulted in a greater reduction in the surface microhardness and compressive residual stresses than decreasing the treatment intensity. Finite element analyses showed that changes in weld toe geometry due to UIT can cause a decrease in the SCF near the surface of the treated weld toe. The SCF was the lowest for the properly treated steel specimens and slightly higher for the under-treated specimens. For the over-treated specimens, the SCFs were nearly as high as for the untreated weld. The SCF increases as the thickness of the flange increased up to 19 mm. With further flange thickness increase to 38 mm, the SCF did not change substantially. The work presented herein demonstrated that indent depth measurements from the base metal side, commonly used for quality control, may not identify over-treatment on their own. Indent depth measurements from both the weld and the base metal sides, obtained by measurement of weld toe impressions, offer a good alternative means for identifying over-treatment. However, for identifying under-treatment, indent depth measurements should be used in conjunction with visual inspection for traces of the original weld toe...|$|E
