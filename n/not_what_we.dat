25|$|Nothing within {{quantum theory}} itself {{requires}} each possibility within a wave function to complement a mental state. As {{all physical states}} (i.e. brain states) are quantum states, their associated mental states should be also. Nonetheless, it is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> experience within physical reality. Albert and Loewer argue that the mind must be intrinsically different than the physical reality as described by quantum theory. Thereby, they reject type-identity physicalism in favour of a non-reductive stance. However, Lockwood saves materialism through the notion of supervenience of the mental on the physical.|$|E
25|$|Once one accepts The Matrix as a {{generated}} {{reality of}} malicious machines invention {{then this is}} Descartes' First Meditation, or evil demon, a hypothesis that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us. The same premise {{can be found in}} Hilary Putnam's brain in a vat scenario proposed in the 1980s. One can make a connection between the premise of The Matrix and Plato's Allegory of the Cave; once one accepts that The Matrix is an illusion, then the allegory of the cave becomes clear. The allegory is related to Plato's theory of Forms, which holds that the true essence of an object is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.|$|E

The anglicised forms wha, wham, whase 'who, whom, whose', and the older whilk 'which' are literary affectations; whilk is only used after a statement He said he'd tint it, whilk wis no whit we wantit tae hear (he said he'd lost it, which is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted to hear". The possessive is formed by adding s or by using an appropriate pronoun The wifie that's hoose gat burnt (the woman whose house was burnt), the wumman that her dochter gat mairit (the woman whose daughter got married); the men that thair boat wis tint (the men whose boat was lost).|$|E

He showed the cast a selection of films adapted from classic novels, including Barry Lyndon and The Age of Innocence, which he believed to be [...] "great movies; everybody worships the art work, [...] it's <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> want to do."

The nickname was, however, deplored by The Railway Magazine, which complained: [...] "Some latitude is allowable, perhaps, to halfpenny papers, {{in the use of}} nicknames, but for a railway itself to adopt its gutter title, is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> expect from a railway company. English railway officers have more dignity than to act in this manner." ...|$|E

500|$|The first {{preliminary}} results were {{announced by the}} State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico at around 4:00. At around 6:25pm, Luis Fortuño's campaign director Angel Cintrón announced {{that there was a}} tendency against the amendments in the results so far. During a press conference, he said [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> expected, it's different to our projections, and we have to accept it." [...] However, he added that the results weren't definitive yet since there were still more than 50% of votes to count. Thomas Rivera Schatz, President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, also acknowledged the defeat saying that the amendments his party had proposed [...] "weren't accepted and that people don't want to amend the Constitution". He added that there could have been some misinformation in the process. [...] The results on the absolute bail bill means that [...] "Puerto Rico remains {{the only place in the}} Western Hemisphere where everyone is entitled to bail regardless of the alleged crime." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} films feature her in roles as distressed women, and often showed Baker in nude scenes, which few major Hollywood actors were willing {{to do at the}} time. Baker became a {{favorite}} of Umberto Lenzi, with her best-known role being in the aforementioned Paranoia, where she played a wealthy widow tormented by two sadistic siblings. In his review of Paranoia, Roger Ebert said: [...] "Carroll Baker, who was a Hollywood sex symbol (for some, it is said) until she sued Joe Levine and got blacklisted, has been around. She may not be an actress, but she can act. In The Carpetbaggers, there was a nice wholesome vulgarity to her performance. She is not intrinsically as bad as she appears in Paranoia. I think maybe she was saying the hell with it and having a good time." [...] As with Paranoia, the majority of the films she made in Italy received poor critical reception in the United States, though they afforded Baker—who had left Hollywood in debt and with two children to support— an income, as well as fame abroad. In retrospect, Baker commented on her career in Italy and on her exploitation film roles, saying: [...] "I think I made more films [...] than I made in Hollywood, but the mentality is different. What they think is wonderful is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> might... it was marvelous for me because it really brought me back to life, and it gave me a whole new outlook. It's wonderful to know about a different world." ...|$|E

500|$|Films {{are a major}} form of entertainment, {{although}} not all films have entertainment as their primary purpose: documentary film, for example, aims to create a record or inform, although the two purposes often work together. The medium was a global business from the beginning: [...] "The Lumière brothers {{were the first to}} send cameramen throughout the world, instructing them to film everything which could be of interest for the public." [...] In 1908, Pathé launched and distributed newsreels and by World War I, films were meeting an enormous need for mass entertainment. [...] "In {{the first decade of the}} [...] century cinematic programmes combined, at random, fictions and newsfilms." [...] The Americans first [...] "contrived a way of producing an illusion of motion through successive images," [...] but [...] "the French were able to transform a scientific principle into a commercially lucrative spectacle". Film therefore became a part of the entertainment industry from its early days. Increasingly sophisticated techniques have been used in the film medium to delight and entertain audiences. Animation, for example, which involves the display of rapid movement in an art work, is one of these techniques that particularly appeals to younger audiences. The advent of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the 21st century made it [...] "possible to do spectacle" [...] more cheaply and [...] "on a scale never dreamed of" [...] by Cecil B. DeMille. From the 1930s to 1950s, movies and radio were the [...] "only mass entertainment" [...] but by the second decade of the 21st century, technological changes, economic decisions, risk aversion and globalisation reduced both the quality and range of films being produced. Sophisticated visual effects and CGI techniques, for example, rather than humans, were used not only to create realistic images of people, landscapes and events (both real and fantastic) but also to animate non-living items such as Lego normally used as entertainment as a game in physical form. Creators of The Lego Movie [...] "wanted the audience to believe they were looking at actual Lego bricks on a tabletop that were shot with a real camera, <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> actually did, which was create vast environments with digital bricks inside the computer." [...] The convergence of computers and film has allowed entertainment to be presented in a new way and the technology has also allowed for those with the personal resources to screen films in a home theatre, recreating in a private venue the quality and experience of a public theatre. This is similar to the way that the nobility in earlier times could stage private musical performances or the use of domestic theatres in large homes to perform private plays in earlier centuries.|$|E
