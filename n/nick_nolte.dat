5|$|In 1984, Hepburn {{starred in}} the dark-comedy Grace Quigley, {{the story of an}} elderly woman who enlists a hitman (<b>Nick</b> <b>Nolte)</b> to kill her. Hepburn found humor in the morbid theme, but reviews were {{negative}} and the box-office was poor. In 1985, she presented a television documentary about the life and career of Spencer Tracy. The majority of Hepburn's roles from this point were in television movies, which did not receive the critical praise of her earlier work in the medium but remained popular with audiences. With each release, Hepburn would declare it her final screen appearance, but she continued to take on new roles.

5000|$|In {{his review}} for The Washington Post, Hal Hinson praised <b>Nick</b> <b>Nolte's</b> performance: [...] "This actor doesn't flinch {{in the least}} from his character's unsavoriness; instead he seems to glory in his {{crumpled}} suits and unwashed hair, {{as if they were}} a kind of spiritual corollary.

The hypothermia was needed to slow metabolism and protect the brain and organs from reduced oxygen supply while Ommaya surgically embolized and removed an AVM which was located near the medulla.

25|$|<b>Nick</b> <b>Nolte</b> and Jeff Bridges were {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Sonny Crockett, but since it was not lucrative for film stars to venture into television at the time, other candidates {{were considered}}.

Larry Wilcox, of CHiPs, was also a candidate for the role of Crockett, but the producers felt that going from one police officer role to another would not be a good fit. After dozens of candidates and a twice-delayed pilot shooting, Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas were chosen as the vice cops. For Johnson, who was by then 34 years old, NBC had particular doubts about the several earlier unsuccessful pilots in which he had starred. After two seasons, Johnson threatened to walk from the series as part of a highly publicized contract dispute. The network was ready to replace him with Mark Harmon, who had recently departed St. Elsewhere, but the network and Johnson were able to resolve their differences and he continued with the series until its end.

[...] He called the film as a whole [...] "beautiful" [...] in spite of how violent it is, and gave it 4 out of 5 stars.

Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was also complimentary towards O'Connor, stating that he [...] "comes out swinging in this flawed but fiercely moving family drama," [...] while A.O.

25|$|Scorsese often casts {{the same}} actors in his films, {{particularly}} Robert De Niro, who collaborated with Scorsese for eight feature films and one short film.

Scorsese has often said he thinks De Niro's best work under his direction was Rupert Pupkin in The King of Comedy. After {{the turn of the}} century, Scorsese found a new muse with younger actor Leonardo DiCaprio, collaborating for five feature films to date, along with one short. Several critics have compared Scorsese's new partnership with DiCaprio with his previous one with De Niro. Frequent collaborators also include Victor Argo (6), Harry Northup (6), Harvey Keitel (5), Murray Moston (5), J. C. MacKenzie (3), Joe Pesci (3), Frank Vincent (3) and Verna Bloom (3).

25|$|Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) {{is a rare}} genetic {{disorder}} {{of the brain that}} occurs only in males. The fatal condition destroys the nervous system, often leaving the victim unable to walk, and talk normally. For many years ALD took the lives of many and continues to do so today. In 1987, Augusto and Michaela Odone, parents of a child affected by ALD, invented Lorenzo’s oil as a treatment for the disease. Their story was in the 1992 Universal Studios motion picture, Lorenzo's Oil, starring <b>Nick</b> <b>Nolte</b> and Susan Sarandon. Dr. Hugo Moser, a renowned scientist at Kennedy Krieger Institute, joined forces with the Odone's, ultimately proving that their treatment, Lorenzo's oil, can prevent the onset of ALD if begun before neurological symptoms appear. Moser and colleagues also created the first diagnostic test for ALD, as well as a newborn screening test that can detect the disease from birth. On January 20, 2007 Dr. Hugo Moser died of complications from surgery to treat pancreatic cancer. Today, Dr. Moser's wife Ann B. Moser, continues this important work at Kennedy Krieger. In 2008, she helped to launch a pilot study to screen for ALD in 5000 newborns born in local Baltimore hospitals, the results of which will be used to advocate for nationwide newborn screening for this devastating disorder.|$|E

Paris, je t'aime was a popular success, taking over $17million, at the world box-office.

Despite an impressive cast including John Turturro, <b>Nick</b> <b>Nolte</b> and up-coming French star Sara Forestier, the film was a failure. A Few Days in September is a thriller set between 5 and 11 September 2001, in which Binoche plays a French secret service agent, who may, or may not, have information relating to impending attacks on the U.S. The film was the recipient of harsh criticism from the press for its perceived trivialization of the events of 11 September 2001.
