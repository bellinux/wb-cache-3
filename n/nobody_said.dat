Disc one was a DVD featuring all videos from the <b>Nobody</b> <b>Said</b> it Was Easy CD, plus rare interviews, live performances, and behind the scenes footage. Disc two was a live album.|$|E

500|$|Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone Magazine {{deemed the}} song a career-making record. Martin Roach claimed in his book, Coldplay: <b>Nobody</b> <b>Said</b> It Was Easy, that {{although}} [...] "Shiver" [...] earned the band their debut UK Top 40 single, it was [...] "Yellow" [...] {{that has changed}} [...] "everything", and that it [...] "exemplifies {{so much of what}} had made Coldplay so popular". In the US, after it was being used in promos of ABC, the band grew in popularity which continued in 2001. According to Barry Walters in his review of Coldplay's second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, for Spin magazine, the band is still known in the United States for their [...] "surprise smash 'Yellow'". [...] A Billboard magazine review said, [...] "After one single ('Yellow') and its accompanying album (Parachutes ..., Coldplay have already been anointed heir to the Brit-rock throne." [...] The song has since been regarded as the centerpiece track on the album.|$|E

500|$|The New York Times wrote, [...] "In glorifying {{those who}} are first, the second is often forgotten... Larry Doby {{integrated}} all those American League ball parks where Jackie Robinson never appeared. And {{he did it with}} class and clout." [...] During the 1997 season, when the long-departed Jackie Robinson's number 42 was being retired throughout baseball, and the still-living Doby was being virtually ignored by the media, an editorial in Sports Illustrated pointed out that Doby had to suffer the same indignities that Robinson did, and with nowhere near the media attention and implicit support. Scoop Jackson in 2007 wrote, in response to the tradition of MLB players wearing jerseys in homage of Robinson, [...] "Second place finishers in America are suckers. And so are those who make the story of history less simple than it needs to be. This happens sometimes in America. Those who don't come first or don't do things a certain way get lost. They disappear." [...] "Jackie got all the publicity for putting up with it (racial slurs). But it was the same thing I had to deal with. He was first, but the crap I took was just as bad. <b>Nobody</b> <b>said,</b> 'We're gonna be nice to the second Black,'" [...] Doby said.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2011 {{interview}} with Rotten Tomatoes, actor William Fichtner retrospectively {{stated that he}} and his partner were silenced after seeing the film, stating that [...] "the human experience was just so pointed; their journeys were so difficult, as life is sometimes. I remember after seeing it, walking down the street [...] I actually went with a girl on a date and saw The Deer Hunter, and we left the theater and walked for like an hour and <b>nobody</b> <b>said</b> anything; we were just kind of stunned about that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Their debut {{full-length}} album, <b>Nobody</b> <b>Said</b> it Was Easy, {{produced by}} Rubin, {{was released in}} 1991, following a two-year delay when Starr was arrested on drug charges and spent six months in jail. The album generated the title track as a single, followed by the hit [...] "Rockin' Is Ma' Business". However, Starr was arrested again and this time {{spent a year in}} jail on a drugs charge. This, combined with poor album sales as the grunge scene started to take over from traditional rock, caused the record label to drop them in 1992.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know as well}} as any {{one when}} a person is good-natured. What made him go off in that hoity-toity fashion? <b>Nobody</b> had <b>said</b> {{anything}} to him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "When {{you hear}} of them I {{would like you}} to {{remember}} that they are friends of mine," [...] she said. [...] "You will, of course, recognize that <b>nobody</b> I <b>said</b> that of could do anything that was really reprehensible." ...|$|R
2500|$|Netanyahu {{opposed the}} Oslo accords from their inception. In 1993, he {{dedicated}} a chapter, entitled [...] "Trojan Horse", {{of his book}} A Place Among the Nations to argue against the Oslo Peace Process. He asserted that Amin al-Husseini {{had been one of}} the masterminds of the Holocaust, and that Yasser Arafat was heir to the former's 'alleged exterminationist Nazism.' During his term as prime minister in the late 1990s, Netanyahu consistently reneged on commitments made by previous Israeli governments as part of the Oslo peace process, leading American peace envoy Dennis Ross to note that [...] "neither President Clinton nor Secretary [...] Albright believed that Bibi had any real interest in pursuing peace." [...] In a 2001 video, Netanyahu, reportedly unaware he was being recorded, said: [...] "They asked me before the election if I'd honor ," [...] "I said I would, but... I'm going to interpret the accords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this galloping forward to the '67 borders. How did we do it? <b>Nobody</b> <b>said</b> what defined military zones were. Defined military zones are security zones; as far as I'm concerned, the entire Jordan Valley is a defined military zone. Go argue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} are not crazy, Tom. <b>Nobody</b> <b>said</b> you were. That crack on the head put you--well, {{a little out of}} sorts, that's all." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Nobody</b> <b>said</b> anything. We {{all just}} stood {{and looked at}} the captain. Tears began to come into the eyes of Tom Myers and his brother George.|$|E

5000|$|Damadian himself said, [...] "Before this happened, <b>nobody</b> ever <b>said</b> to me 'They {{will not}} give you the Nobel Prize for Medicine {{because you are a}} {{creation}} scientist'. If people were actively campaigning against me because of that, I never knew it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I accuse <b>nobody,</b> sir,' <b>said</b> the old man, {{standing}} his ground, {{and speaking}} steadily, but respectfully, 'I wouldn't say nothing to bring any one into trouble if I could help it, and I came {{to ask you}} what was to be done.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, my dear, <b>nobody</b> <b>said</b> there were; but as to {{not meeting}} with {{many people in}} this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, they never did {{discover}} what became of the bear; but in the meanwhile <b>nobody</b> <b>said</b> anything further {{for a moment or}} two. Then the major rubbed his leg.|$|E
60|$|Then Carroll came down, and a {{few moments}} later Mrs. Chisholm {{appeared}} and they went in to dinner in a low-ceilinged room. <b>Nobody</b> <b>said</b> anything of importance, but by and by Mabel turned to Vane.|$|E

6000|$|... "By Jove!" [...] {{he thought}} to himself, [...] "I didn't know that the clergyman's {{daughter}} was like this; <b>nobody</b> ever <b>said</b> so. After all, that fellow Morris can't be half such a fool as he looks, for he kept it dark." [...] Then he stepped forward with outstretched hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Papa {{has been}} talking about you downstairs. He has come home from Ballintubber, very tired and very unhappy, and he thinks you have been made to go to bed without your supper because we have been attacking you about religion. I have told him that <b>nobody</b> has <b>said</b> a word to you." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{advanced}} {{in the most}} perfect silence and very slowly. <b>Nobody</b> <b>said</b> anything, and if orders were given {{this must have been}} done by signs. I could not see that any of them had firearms.|$|E
6000|$|She read it, {{handed it}} to Tod, who also read it and {{handed it to}} Felix. <b>Nobody</b> <b>said</b> anything. It was so {{altogether}} simple and friendly a note that Felix felt pleased with it, thinking: 'I expressed that well!' ...|$|E
6000|$|They stopped within arm's {{length of}} the whites, and for some time <b>nobody</b> <b>said</b> a word. Then Hassim gave Lingard a {{significant}} glance, and uttered rapidly with a slight toss of the head that indicated in a manner {{the whole of the}} yacht: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have seen}} <b>nobody</b> yet,' <b>said</b> Millbank; 'they {{would not let}} me till to- day. Vere looked in this morning and left me this book, but I was asleep.

6000|$|... 'Then, {{not being}} a stranger, I shall be in <b>nobody's</b> way,' <b>said</b> Miss Tox, 'and {{everything}} will go on just as if I were not here. Mrs Richards will do her mending, or her ironing, or her nursing, whatever it is, without minding me: and you'll smoke your pipe, too, if you're so disposed, Sir, won't you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ain't no dust on our clo'es," [...] said Ans, coughing, {{winking at}} Bert, and {{brushing}} {{off with an}} elaborately finical gesture an imaginary fleck from his knee and elbow. [...] "Ain't we togged out? I guess <b>nobody</b> <b>said</b> 'boo' to us down to St. Peter, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Nobody</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Hello, Jim!"-not even McPhail or Vance. They nodded merely, {{and went}} on with their smoking. The {{children}} followed him {{and stared at him}} without compassion. They had heard him called a scoundrel and a thief too often at home to feel any pity for his pale face.|$|E
60|$|<b>Nobody</b> <b>said</b> {{anything}} further, {{and they}} plodded silently {{into the gloom}} that still shrouded all the hillside. It was dusk {{when they came back}} again, but they had found no sign of Trooper Probyn, or anything that might account for his disappearance, except an empty 44-cartridge lying not far from his trail.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't say that, Mr. Greenwood. There's {{nothing to}} make you say that. The Marquis is very ill, but <b>nobody</b> has <b>said</b> that he's so bad as that." [...] Mr. Greenwood shook his head, but did not move from the {{position}} {{in which he was}} standing. [...] "I suppose that on this occasion Hampstead is doing what is right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So it {{is really}} <b>nobody's</b> fault," [...] <b>said</b> Dick quickly, to avoid a {{possible}} quarrel. [...] "The question is: {{how are we going}} to find the trail again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, there wasn't <b>nobody</b> hurt," [...] <b>said</b> Captain Kittridge. [...] "If Mis' Kittridge {{would let}} me, I'd {{be glad to}} go aboard this 'ere, and be {{launched}} with 'em." ...|$|R
