The purpose of this work was to analyze the efficacy of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner on the control of Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton (Lepidoptera: Phyllocnistidae) in laboratory and field trials. In the laboratory, four B. thuringiensis were used: Dipel (commercial formulation) and the isolates K, 6, and 15 (collections of the University of Azores). A surfactant solution of <b>nonoxinol</b> also was tested with or without the different suspensions of B. thuringiensis. Leaves of Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck with second or third instars of leafminer larvae were used in all tests. Bacterial suspensions were applied topically on the surface of intact leaf mines or by injection inside the mine, near the head of the leafminer. When injecting both concentrations of Dipel into the mines, mortality of the leafminers increased compared with the topical application, although no significant differences were observed. The addition of the <b>nonoxinol</b> to the Dipel suspension, applied topically, increased the effect of B. thuringiensis, but differences were not significant. The mortality of the leafminers treated only with the <b>nonoxinol</b> solution increased significantly 48 h after treatment, compared with the control group, suggesting an insecticidal effect of this surfactant when used at a concentration of 0. 01 %. All the tested B. thuringiensis were equally active against the leafminer, either when applied topically or by mine injection. Field trials showed a significant difference between larval mortality of the control group and the results observed at the trees treated with B. thuringiensis 48 h after treatments...|$|E

We examined the cytotoxicity of 6 antiseptics commonly used on cultured human fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Cultured cells were exposed for 15 min to Hibitane (chlorhexidine), Biseptine (chlorhexidine + benzalkonium chloride + benzylic alcool), dermic Betadine (polvidone iodine + <b>nonoxinol),</b> scrub Betadine (polyvidone iodine + quaternary ammonium) and gynecologic Betadine (polyvidone iodine). The cell viability was determined using the MTT test. At therapeutic concentration all the antiseptics were cytotoxic for fibroblasts and keratinocytes. The {{data suggest that the}} antiseptics must be used in function of the time of the grafting of the cultured epithelium.

40|$|The {{probiotic}} relevant {{characteristics of}} 45 strains of vaginal Lactobocillus isolated from healthy women were analyzed. Of these, 21 strains {{were classified as}} L. crispatus, 17 as L. jensenii, six as L. gasseri, and one as L. plantarum. The rate of acidification varied significantly between the strains as did their ability to form biofilms. None used glycogen as a fermentable carbohydrate. H(2) O(2) generation was common, especially among L. jensenii isolates (88 %). No bacteriocinogenic strains were detected. Most strains harbored plasmids (from 1 to 7) of various sizes, those in excess of 50 kb being frequent. One of these plasmids {{was found to be}} promiscuous since it hybridized with extrachromosomal bands of 15 isolates. All strains were resistant to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, clindamycin, trimethoprim, and sulfametoxazole and susceptible to a series of beta-lactams, erythromycin, tetracycline, and benzalkonium chloride. Almost half of the strains were highly resistant to <b>nonoxinol</b> 9, which is commonly used as a spermicide. Based on these analyses, strains of all three common species are proposed as new probiotic candidates...|$|E
