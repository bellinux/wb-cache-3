50|$|Rajbali Pandey {{compares the}} Upanayana {{rite of passage}} to Baptism in Christianity where the person is born again unto spiritual knowledge, in {{addition}} to it being the ancient Indian rite of passage {{for the start of}} formal education of <b>writing,</b> <b>numbers,</b> <b>reading,</b> Vedangas, arts and other skills. The Upanayana rite of passage was also important to the teacher, as the student would therefrom begin to live in the Gurukul (school). Many medieval era texts discuss Upanayana in the context of three Varnas (caste, class) - Brahmins, Kshtreyas and Vaishyas. Several texts such as Sushruta Sutrasthana, however, also include Sudras entering schools and the formal education process, stating that the Upanayana samskara was open to everyone. The upanayana ceremony extended to women, in ancient Sanskrit texts, and the girls who underwent this rite of passage then pursued studies were called Brahmavadini. Those who didn't, performed upanayana ceremony {{at the time of their}} wedding. Instead of sacred thread, girls would wear their robe (now called sari or saree) in the manner of the sacred thread, that is over her left shoulder during this rite of passage.|$|R

Both Microsoft Excel and Access were integrated as back and front-end respectively. The two softwares were linked for update of records {{as well as}} security purposes during data entry of students records. The link was collapsed after the deadline of data entry to convert the access table to local and enhance data security. Based on the proposed system multiple parameters such as invigilators marks grades attendance and absenteeism were assessed and identified for the various subjects in the entire examination processes. The System applied structured query languagesql for searching specific named parameter for analysis where the total <b>number</b> <b>written</b> papers <b>number</b> of students and performance could also be accessed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{previously}} reported mathematical disabilities (MD) of children with Velo-Cardio-Facial Syndrome (VCFS) in children of a younger age range. Fourteen children with VCFS (aged 6 - 10 years) participated in this study. These children were individually matched on sex, IQ, age and parental educational level to a control group of peers, selected from the same classes. A broad range of mathematical abilities were assessed, comprising <b>number</b> <b>reading</b> and <b>writing,</b> <b>number</b> comparison, counting, single-digit arithmetic, multidigit arithmetic and word problem solving. Consistent with previous reports, children with VCFS were significantly slower in counting numerosities and they tended to perform more poorly on number comparison. These results indicate that difficulties in low-level number processing in children with VCFS occur already at a very young age. Furthermore, children with VCFS demonstrated preserved retrieval of arithmetic facts, but, in contrast to older children with VCFS, no procedural difficulties in mathematics were observed. Finally, word problem solving appeared to be an important area of weakness, starting already at this young age. status: publishe...|$|R
500|$|Negative zero {{is another}} {{redundant}} feature of {{many ways of}} <b>writing</b> <b>numbers.</b> In number systems, such as the real numbers, where [...] "0" [...] denotes the additive identity and is neither positive nor negative, the usual interpretation of [...] "−0" [...] is that it should denote the additive inverse of 0, which forces −0=0. Nonetheless, some scientific applications use separate positive and negative zeroes, as do some computing binary number systems (for example integers stored in the sign and magnitude or ones' complement formats, or floating point numbers as specified by the IEEE floating-point standard).|$|R
40|$|Starting with {{a number}} n and a base b you can {{collapse}} it to a smaller <b>number</b> by <b>writing</b> the <b>number</b> in base b and then writing plus signs between the digits (i. e., splitting the expansion of n into pieces and adding them up). By strategically placing the plus signs then in base 2 we can always collapse n to a single digit using at most 2 steps, in base 3 this can also be done in at most two steps {{with the exception of}} 11 numbers which require 3 steps, and in base 4 and above 3 steps always suffice. ...|$|R

A period or dot is used to denote the decimal separator, which separates the integral and the fractional parts of a decimal <b>number.</b> When <b>writing</b> large <b>numbers</b> with many digits, commas are used as delimiters to group digits, indicating the thousand (হাজার hazar), the hundred thousand or lakh (লাখ lakh or লক্ষ lôkkhô), and the ten million or hundred lakh or crore (কোটি koti) units. In other words, leftwards from the decimal separator, the first grouping consists of three digits, and the subsequent groupings always consist of two digits.|$|R
