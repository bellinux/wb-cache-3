50|$|FeVTAML(=O), TAML = tetraamido macrocyclic ligand, {{is formed}} by the {{reaction}} of FeIII(TAML)(H2O)(PPh4) with 2-5 equivalents of meta-chloroperbenzoic acid at -60 ˚C in <b>n-butyronitrile.</b> This compound has a deep green color with absorption maxima at 445 and 630 nm. It {{is reported to be}} stable for at least 1 month at 77 K. FeVTAML(=O) was characterized with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Mössbauer, EXAFS, ESI-MS, reactivity studies, and DFT calculations. This compound is capable of 1 electron oxidation at the metal as opposed to at the ligand. This is due to the stronger -donor capacity of deprotonated amide nitrogens on TAML.|$|E
40|$|Nitriles {{are strong}} polar {{compounds}} showing a highly non-ideal behavior, {{which makes them}} challenging systems from a modeling point of view; in spite of this, accurate predictions for the vapor-liquid equilibria of these systems are needed, as some of them, like acetonitrile (CH 3 CN) and propionitrile (C 2 H 5 CN), {{play an important role}} as organic solvents in several industrial processes. This work deals with the calculation of the vapor - liquid equilibria (VLE) of nitriles and their mixtures by using the crossover soft-SAFT Equation of State (EoS). Both polar and associating interactions are taken into account in a single association term in the crossover soft-SAFT equation, while the crossover term allows for accurate calculations both far from and close to the critical point. Molecular parameters for acetonitrile, propionitrile and <b>n-butyronitrile</b> (C 3 H 7 CN) are regressed from experimental data. Their transferability is tested by the calculation of the VLE of heavier linear nitriles, namely, valeronitrile (C 4 H 9 CN) and hexanonitrile (C 5 H 11 CN), not included in the fitting procedure. Crossover soft-SAFT results are in excellent agreement with experimental data for the whole range of thermodynamic conditions investigated, proving the robustness of the approach. Parameters transferability has also been used to describe the isomers <b>n-butyronitrile</b> and i-butyronitrile. Finally, the nitriles soft-SAFT model is further tested in VLE calculation of mixtures with benzene, carbon tetrachloride and carbon dioxide, which proved to be satisfactory as well...|$|E
40|$|In rats, {{a single}} {{administration}} of acrylonitrile (vinyl cyanide) produces a rapidly occurring bilateral adrenal apoplexy.

Prolonging the two-carbon chain of propionitrile by a methyl group (<b>n-butyronitrile)</b> enhances, replacing the methyl by bromide or nitrile decreases, while substitution by an amino group abolistes the ulcerogenic potency and variably affects the adrenocorticolytic action. On assaying a large number of nonnitrile compounds as well for ulcerogenic effect, such as thiols and amines, this effect was found to be related to a two-carbon structure bearing electronegative radicals on one or both ends of the chain...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{extension}} of the Anisotropic United Atoms intermolecular potential model is proposed for nitriles. The electrostatic part of the intermolecular potential is calculated using atomic charges obtained by a simple Mulliken population analysis. The repulsion-dispersion interaction parameters for methyl and methylene groups are taken from transferable AUA 4 literature parameters [Ungerer et al., J. Chem. Phys., 2000, 112, 5499]. Non-bonding Lennard-Jones intermolecular potential parameters are regressed for the carbon and nitrogen atoms of the nitrile group (–CN) from experimental vapor-liquid equilibrium data of acetonitrile. Gibbs Ensemble Monte Carlo simulations and experimental data agreement is very good for acetonitrile, and better than previous molecular potential proposed by Hloucha et al. [J. Chem. Phys., 2000, 113, 5401]. The transferability of the resulting potential is then successfully tested, without any further readjustment, to predict vapor-liquid phase equilibrium of propionitrile and <b>n-butyronitrile...</b>|$|E
40|$|R-(-) -Mandelic acid was {{produced}} from racemic mandelonitrile by Alcaligenes faecalis ATCC 8750. Ammonium acetate or L-glutamic acid as the carbon source and <b>n-butyronitrile</b> as the inducer {{in the culture}} medium were effective for bacterial growth and the induction of R-(-) -mandelic acid-producing activity. The R-(-) -mandelic acid formed from mandelonitrile by resting cells was present in a 100 % enantiomeric excess. A. faecalis ATCC 8750 has an R-enantioselective nitrilase for mandelonitrile and an amidase for mandelamide. As R-(-) -mandelic acid {{was produced}} from racemic mandelonitrile in a yield of 91 %, whereas no S-mandelonitrile was left, the S-mandelonitrile remaining in the reaction is spontaneously racemized because of the chemical equilibrium and is used as the substrate. Consequently, almost all the mandelonitrile is consumed and converted to R-(-) -mandelic acid. R-(-) -Mandelic acid was also produced when benzaldehyde plus HCN {{was used as the}} substrate...|$|E

The optimum pH of the reaction was around 8. 0. S-(+) -Ibuprofen formed from Ibu-CN by resting cells was present in a 95 % enantiomeric excess. Acinetobacter sp. strain AK 226 appeared to possess a nitrilase for Ibu-CN because 2 -(4 '-isobutylphenyl) propionamide was not detected in the reaction mixture and 2 -(4 '-isobutylphenyl) propionamide was not hydrolyzed to S-(+) -ibuprofen.

Alkyl nitriles (e. g., acrylonitrile, propionitrile) are used extensively in the manufacture of acrylic fibers, plastics, and surface coatings and as intermediates in the synthesis of antioxidants, pharmaceuticals, and dyes. Many people are exposed to these compounds, since 5 - 30 %o of acrylonitrile may remain as monomers in various synthetic products or may become liberated with the aging of polymers (1). Thus, health implications of these compounds are of considerable interest. Previous Studies While studying the effect of hormonal and nonhormonal steroids as well as various hepatic drug-metabolizing enzyme inducers on the toxicity of alkyl nitriles, we recently found (2) that in rats acrylonitrile produces bilateral adrenal apoplexy.

The Ru(III/II) oxidation waves are irreversible for 1 - 8 (Epa = 0. 15 - 0. 26 V vs FeCp 2 +/ 0) but reversible for 9 and 10 (E 1 / 2 = 0. 99 and 1. 00 V, respectively). The absorption bands in the visible region for 1 - 8 (λmax = 502 - 526 nm) and 9 and 10 (λmax ca. 410 nm) are assigned as dπ(Ru II) → π*(polypyridine) MLCT transitions. Complexes 1 - 8 weakly emit at λmax = 748 - 786 nm in CH 3 CN solution at 298 K (λex = 550 nm). Complexes 9 and 10 are nonemissive in CH 2 Cl 2 solution at 298 K, but in glassy <b>n-butyronitrile</b> at 77 K, excitation at λ = 415 nm produces emission at λmax = 597 and 615 nm, respectively.
