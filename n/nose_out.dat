500|$|Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia, {{said that}} release of Inflikted [...] "brings to {{fruition}} {{one of the}} most anticipated yet most improbable reunions in heavy metal history." [...] Rivadavia expressed that Duplantier [...] "generally just keeps a low sonic profile and his <b>nose</b> <b>out</b> of trouble, but Rizzo's contributions really can't be overstated. [...] His otherworldly soloing and inventive melodic lines often serve as the creative catalysts responsible for the most inspired moments." [...] Keith Carman of Exclaim! praised the group's musicianship on Inflikted, saying that [...] "it wouldn't be a stretch to proclaim that Inflikted, with its detuned grunt, bombastic lyrics and hyperactive drumming, is the album that should have succeeded Sepultura's widely-acclaimed 1996 powerhouse Roots." [...] Like the former, Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote enthusiastically for both Cavalera Conspiracy and Inflikted.|$|E
500|$|In November 2010, it was {{announced}} that Mark would begin a relationship with Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer). Mark interviewed Kate while he was investigating who pushed Paul. Of their first meeting, McGregor commented [...] " [...] thinks she's pretty cute but not a lot comes of it later, but there's a bit of a spark there." [...] McGregor opined that Kate and Mark were a good match. Mark asked Kate to dinner, but she turned him down. She later changed her mind when he rescued her from lawyers, Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) and Samantha Fitzgerald (Simone Buchanan). Brewer welcomed the storyline, believing that her character was ready to move on from her previous relationship with Declan Napier (Erin Mullally). When Declan appeared during Kate and Mark's date, Kate was [...] "furious" [...] that he still had a hold on her life. Despite Kate telling Declan that she was over him, Declan saw Mark as a threat. McGregor commented that Mark put Declan's <b>nose</b> <b>out</b> of joint. Declan became a nuisance and tried to control Kate by telling her that Mark had threatened and attacked him. Kate initially believed Declan, but when she discovered the truth she had to work to get Mark back.|$|E
2500|$|The party {{achieved}} {{major breakthrough}} in the 1993 federal election, when it jumped to 52 seats, just two seats behind the Bloc Quebecois who held Official Opposition status. Reform actually {{finished second in the}} nationwide popular vote, due almost entirely to a strong showing in the west. Virtually all of the PCs' support in western Canada, particularly in rural areas, transferred to Reform. However, the Bloc's concentration of support in Quebec was slightly larger, allowing it to just <b>nose</b> <b>out</b> Reform for Official Opposition status. Nevertheless, the Liberals reckoned Reform as their main opposition on all other issues that were not specific to Quebec. [...] Also, in 1995 when Bloc leader Lucien Bouchard's position as Opposition Leader granted him a meeting with visiting US President Bill Clinton, Manning was also given a meeting with Clinton in order to defuse Bouchard's separatist leverage.|$|E

2500|$|Nick and Sharon are {{recognized}} as a fictional supercouple in the soap opera genre. They are popularly referred to as [...] "Shick", a portmanteau which combines the names Sharon and Nick. On a list of [...] "Greatest Soap Opera Supercouples" [...] compiled by Kim Potts of The Huffington Post, Nick and Sharon were placed 16th. Potts noted, [...] "Young love hasn't {{turned out to be}} enduring love for Nick and Sharon, whose multiple affairs and tragic loss of daughter Cassie in a car accident led to the end of their marriage. Nick is now married to Phyllis (who he began an affair with after Cassie's death), but he can't keep his <b>nose</b> <b>out</b> of Sharon's business, much to Phyllis' chagrin, and a Nick/Sharon reunion is always a possibility." [...] On-Air On-Soaps wrote that Nick and Sharon have a [...] "tortured" [...] past together. Nick and Sharon are often compared to Nick's parents, Victor and Nikki Newman, who are considered one of the genre's leading supercouples. Robin Raven of Yahoo! TV noted that [...] "Sharon and Nick Newman are following the footsteps of Victor and Nikki Newman in how many times they break up and get back together."

2500|$|Nancy {{soon after}} becomes pregnant. Nancy begins helping her friend, Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton) who has escaped from prison. Mitzeee {{was in prison}} for the {{stabbing}} of Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), Fox explained that Nancy has [...] "always known her friend was innocent" [...] as she knows that she is not capable of stabbing Mercedes. Nancy knows Mercedes has set Mitzeee up as she has threatened her on a couple of occasions, even saying [...] "something bad might happen to Nancy's baby if she doesn't get her <b>nose</b> <b>out</b> and that's made Nancy more determined". Fox said that Nancy's attitude towards Mitzeee's situation stems from when Becca was wrongly accused, sent to prison and murdered in jail which makes her [...] "really desperate to get this right for Mitzeee - to get her out and take Mercedes down!" [...] Explaining why Nancy and Mitzeee are such good friends, Fox said: [...] "They're such different people on the surface, but deep down Ann Minniver - Mitzeee's alter ego - is very moral, kind and caring and she's a very clever girl. I think those are all things that Nancy responds to and enjoys. Also, I think Mitzeee just makes Nancy laugh. Mitzeee can be a bit silly sometimes, and that makes Nancy smile". During the storyline, Nancy feuds with Mercedes. Fox said that Nancy has a bit of a [...] "bad girl" [...] in her which she shows during her confrontations with Mercedes, adding that the character has got [...] "more fire in her belly than maybe we'd realised".|$|E
