That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay in the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he never said a word.

500|$|Although Safran {{initially}} {{intended the}} series {{to be an}} ensemble, with Alex the lead protagonist, this changed after Chopra was cast. As the show's [...] "face" [...] and featuring in its publicity campaign, Alex dominated the storyline and became the main character of the series. Although the character was initially written as Caucasian, Safran completely rewrote her character with Chopra in his mind, tweaking her background as she became half-Indian and spent ten years in Mumbai. Her casting also helped change Alex's personality; in one change, the [...] "jaded and brooding" [...] Alex became [...] "fun and warm". Safran initially focused on the character's dark side, {{saying that he had}} never imagined a positive side: [...] "Priyanka came in and played all of that but as a character who was always in control. And still warm and vibrant because she knew <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to get through her walls. From that point on, Alex was the kind of character who can have humor, who can have heart".|$|E

[...] The fact that the city of Freetown has been completely abandoned is foreign to the student, because the nation is and has always been heavily reliant on physical contact and very close interaction. Osei has indicated that following the no touching rule that the medical personnel have been promoting is extremely difficult for her. Osei continues by saying that she does not even know how her people are surviving.|$|R

500|$|Following Chopra's casting, {{the series}} {{underwent}} a significant change. Safran had initially {{intended to make}} the show as an ensemble drama with no obvious lead, but after Chopra's casting, Alex became the main character and the show was re-structured around her. The character was initially written to be white, which was also re-written, keeping Chopra in mind. The background of the character was tweaked by making her half-Indian, with an additional backstory of Alex having spent ten years in Mumbai, India. Apart from changing her ethnicity, Safran completely re-envisioned the character. For example, Alex was initially written as [...] "jaded and brooding" [...] but was re-written as [...] "fun and warm". Earlier, the series was supposed {{to focus on the}} character's dark side because Safran had never imagined Alex having a positive side, which changed after Chopra stepped in the role. Safran said, [...] "Priyanka came in and played all of that but as a character who was always in control.

500|$|Prompted {{in part by}} Salinger's letter, Bakshi briefly {{retired to}} focus on painting. During this time he {{completed}} the screenplay for If I Catch Her, I'll Kill Her, a live-action feature he had been developing since the late 1960s. United Artists and Paramount Pictures each paid Bakshi to develop the film in the 1970s, but were unwilling to produce it, as were the studios he pitched the film to in the 1980s. According to Bakshi, [...] "They thought that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to admit that women can—and do—cheat on their husbands. They thought it was too hot, which made no sense." [...] In 1985, he {{received a phone call}} from The Rolling Stones' manager, Tony King, who told Bakshi that the band had recorded a cover of Bob & Earl's [...] "Harlem Shuffle", and wanted Bakshi to direct the music video. He was told that the live-action shoot needed to be completed within one day (January 28, 1986) for it to be shown at the Grammy Awards. Production designer Wolf Kroeger was forced to drastically compact his sets, and animation director and designer John Kricfalusi had to push his team, including Lynne Naylor, Jim Smith and Bob Jaques, to complete the animation within a few weeks. The band's arrival at the set was delayed by a snowstorm and several takes were ruined when the cameras crossed paths. Bakshi was forced to pay the union wages out of his own fees, and the continuity between Kricfalusi's animation and the live-action footage did not match; however, the video was completed on time.|$|E
500|$|The {{third season}} was {{initially}} planned to include three separate mysteries {{that would be}} introduced and resolved {{in a series of}} non-overlapping story arcs. Thomas realized by talking to CW Entertainment President Dawn Ostroff that viewers got too confused by his original format, and the new format would allow new viewers to start watching at any point in the season. Inspired by the improvised thriller Bubble, Thomas started laying [...] "subtle" [...] motives for the second mystery during the first one, so that fans would have [...] "a theory on whodunit" [...] when it occurred. The first mystery took place over the first nine episodes. Originally, the second mystery was to be seven episodes long and the third mystery was to occur over the last six episodes of the season. This was changed when The CW ordered a 20 episode season instead of the usual 22 episodes. The second mystery arc was shortened from seven episodes to six, and the third mystery was first changed from a six episode arc to a five episode arc. After an eight-week hiatus for the series was announced, the final mystery was changed to five stand-alone episodes designed to be friendlier to new viewers. The final mystery was originally going to be [...] "unlike any of the others we've done before". Previously, [...] "nice characters" [...] like Wallace and Mac had always been absent from the big mystery because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to believe them as a suspect. For the third mystery, Thomas had wanted to present a situation where Wallace and Mac could be fully involved, [...] "key players [...] really interesting stuff to do".|$|E

2500|$|The series' {{stunt man}} and stunt {{arranger}} Ray Austin expressed {{the opinion that}} the show's violence ultimately harmed its popular success in the United States. There The Avengers was given a late timeslot due to its violence. [...] "They did that with the first Avengers here , with Diana Rigg. They put us on at 11:30 pm on CBS , {{because it was too}} violent." [...] Austin goes on to explain that U.S. television follows a [...] "different code". Austin said that on The Avengers [...] "we were determined to do the show our way, the English way, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to stop us! And, indeed, no one did stop us. We never, never got to prime time. And it was our own faults, because we would not comply to the Midwest. That's where the money comes from in this country, nowhere else. Forget Los Angeles, forget New York—you have to aim for the Midwest. If the Midwest watches your show, you've made it." [...] In fact the first and second series of Emma Peel episodes mainly aired at 10:00 pm on ABC. The final Rigg episodes and all the Linda Thorson episodes mainly ran at 7:30 pm, also on ABC.|$|E
