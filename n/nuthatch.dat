5|$|The {{beautiful}} <b>nuthatch</b> {{was first}} described in 1843 by British zoologist Edward Blyth, from a specimen he examined in Darjeeling. Its kinship {{with other members}} of the genus is unclear. The bright blue color of its plumage invites a comparison to the blue <b>nuthatch</b> (S. azurea), or other blue-tinted <b>nuthatch</b> species such as the velvet-fronted <b>nuthatch</b> (S. frontalis), yellow-billed <b>nuthatch</b> (S. solangiae) and the sulphur-billed <b>nuthatch</b> (S. oenochlamys), but its distribution being focused in the eastern Himalayas, and the uniqueness of its plumage, argues against the assumption. According to the International Ornithological Congress and ornithologist Alan P. Peterson, no subspecies have been identified.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 {{review of}} Asian nuthatches {{suggested}} {{that there are still}} unresolved problems in <b>nuthatch</b> taxonomy and proposed splitting the genus Sitta. This suggestion would move the red- and yellow-billed south Asian species (velvet-fronted, yellow-billed and sulphur-billed nuthatches) to a new genus, create a third genus for the blue <b>nuthatch,</b> and possibly a fourth for the beautiful <b>nuthatch.</b>|$|E
5|$|For the few {{species on}} which data are available, the average <b>nuthatch</b> {{lifespan}} {{in the wild}} is between 2 and 3.5years, although ages of up to 10 years have been recorded. The Eurasian <b>nuthatch</b> has an adult annual survival rate of 53% and the male Corsican <b>nuthatch</b> 61.6%. Nuthatches and other small woodland birds share the same predators: accipiters, owls, squirrels and woodpeckers. An American study showed that <b>nuthatch</b> responses to predators {{may be linked to}} reproductive strategies. It measured the willingness of males of two species to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, or a house wren, which destroys eggs. The white-breasted <b>nuthatch</b> is shorter-lived than the red-breasted <b>nuthatch,</b> but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk. This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of their larger broods.|$|E
5|$|All <b>nuthatches</b> {{appear to}} store food, {{especially}} seeds, in tree crevices, in the ground, under small stones, or behind bark flakes, and these caches are remembered {{for as long}} as 30 days. Similarly, the rock <b>nuthatches</b> wedge snails into suitable crevices for consumption in times of need. European <b>nuthatches</b> have been found to avoid using their caches during benign conditions in order to save them for harsher times.|$|R
5|$|<b>Nuthatches</b> {{are small}} {{woodland}} birds. They have the unusual ability to climb down trees head first, unlike other birds {{which can only}} go upwards. <b>Nuthatches</b> have big heads, short tails and powerful bills and feet.|$|R
30|$|Our results {{indicate}} that in undisturbed sites, pygmy <b>nuthatches</b> had a high niche breadth (foraging significantly more on the thin branches), while white-breasted <b>nuthatches</b> and brown creepers had similar medium niche breadth values (more often foraged in thick branches and lower trunk, respectively), causing the last two {{to have a high}} niche overlap. In contrast, in disturbed sites, niche breadth and overlap values were similar for all three tree-climbing species. All observed overlaps for both forest types were higher than expected, but expected values in disturbed sites suggest the possibility of competition on these sites. Pygmy <b>nuthatches</b> were more sighted than white-breasted <b>nuthatches</b> and brown creepers in both forest types.|$|R
5|$|<b>Nuthatch</b> {{taxonomy}} is complex, with geographically separated species sometimes closely resembling each other. The white-breasted <b>nuthatch</b> has {{an appearance}} and contact call {{similar to those}} of the white-cheeked <b>nuthatch,</b> Sitta leucopsis, of the Himalayas and was formerly considered to be conspecific with it. A study published in 2012 showed that four distinct lineages were genetically isolated from each other and could represent different species, recognizable by morphology and song. A molecular phylogeny published in 2014 and including all main species' lineages within nuthatches concluded that the white-breasted <b>nuthatch</b> was more closely related to the giant <b>nuthatch</b> (S. magna) than to S. przewalskii, formerly regarded as possibly conspecific with it; S. przewalskii turned out to be basal in the family.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian, chestnut-vented, Kashmir and chestnut-bellied nuthatches form another {{superspecies}} {{and replace}} each other geographically across Asia. They are currently {{considered to be}} four separate species, but the south-Asian forms were once {{believed to be a}} subspecies of the Eurasian <b>nuthatch.</b> A recent change in this taxonomy is a split of the chestnut-bellied <b>nuthatch</b> into three species, namely the Indian <b>nuthatch,</b> Sitta castanea, found south of the Ganges, the Burmese <b>nuthatch,</b> Sitta neglecta, found in southeast Asia, and the chestnut-bellied <b>nuthatch</b> sensu stricto, S. cinnamoventris, which occurs in the Himalayas. Mitochondrial DNA studies have demonstrated that the white-breasted northern subspecies of Eurasian <b>nuthatch,</b> S. (europea) arctica, is distinctive, and also a possible candidate for full species status. This split has been accepted by the British Ornithologists' Union.|$|E
5|$|The nuthatches {{are all in}} {{the genus}} Sitta Linnaeus, 1758, a name derived from , Ancient Greek for this bird. <b>Nuthatch</b> refers to the {{propensity}} of some species to wedge a large insect or seed in a crack and hack at it with their strong bills. Species boundaries in the nuthatches are difficult to define. The red-breasted <b>nuthatch,</b> Corsican <b>nuthatch</b> and Chinese <b>nuthatch</b> have breeding ranges separated by thousands of kilometres, but are similar in habitat preference, appearance and song. They were formerly considered to be one species, but are now normally split into three and comprise a superspecies along with the Krüper's and Algerian <b>nuthatch.</b> Unusually for nuthatches, all five species excavate their own nests.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nuthatches</b> {{are small}} {{woodland}} birds. They have the unusual ability to climb down trees head first, unlike other birds {{which can only}} go upwards. <b>Nuthatches</b> have big heads, short tails, and powerful bills and feet. Three species have been recorded in New Jersey.|$|R
5|$|The <b>nuthatches</b> {{constitute}} a genus, Sitta, of small passerine birds {{belonging to the}} family Sittidae. Characterised by large heads, short tails, and powerful bills and feet, <b>nuthatches</b> advertise their territory using loud, simple songs. Most species exhibit grey or bluish upperparts and a black eye stripe.|$|R

5|$|Across {{most of its}} European range, {{the most}} {{important}} predator of the Eurasian <b>nuthatch</b> is the sparrowhawk. Other species known to prey on this <b>nuthatch</b> include the northern goshawk, hobby, tawny owl, pygmy owl and least weasel. A Swedish study showed that 6.2% of the <b>nuthatch</b> nests in their study area were raided by predators. The perpetrators were not identified, but the main single predator of tit nests in the same study was the great spotted woodpecker.|$|E
5|$|Cold can be {{a problem}} for small birds that do not migrate. Communal {{roosting}} in tight huddles can help conserve heat and several <b>nuthatch</b> species employ itup to 170 pygmy nuthatches have been seen in a single roost. The pygmy <b>nuthatch</b> is able to lower its body temperature when roosting, conserving energy through hypothermia and a lowered metabolic rate.|$|E
5|$|In {{much of its}} range, Eurasian is {{the only}} <b>nuthatch</b> present. In {{southeast}} Europe and southwest Asia, the western and eastern rock nuthatches are larger and paler than the Eurasian species. They also lack white spots in the tail and are usually found in a different, stony habitat, and Krüper's <b>nuthatch</b> is small and has a black cap and reddish breast patch. In southwest China, the chestnut-vented <b>nuthatch</b> {{is very similar to}} the European bird, but is darker above, has less white on the face and has greyer underparts.|$|E

5|$|Members of the <b>nuthatch</b> family live {{in most of}} North America and Europe and {{throughout}} Asia down to the Wallace Line. Nuthatches are sparsely represented in Africa; one species lives in a small area of northeastern Algeria and a population of the Eurasian <b>nuthatch</b> subspecies, S. e. hispaniensis, lives {{in the mountains of}} Morocco. Most species are resident year-round. The only significant migrant is the red-breasted <b>nuthatch,</b> which winters widely across North America, deserting the northernmost parts of its breeding range in Canada; it has been recorded as a vagrant in Bermuda, Iceland and England.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian <b>nuthatch</b> or wood <b>nuthatch</b> (Sitta europaea) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird {{found throughout}} temperate Asia and in Europe, where its name is the <b>nuthatch.</b> Like other nuthatches, it is a short-tailed bird with a long bill, blue-grey upperparts and a black eye-stripe. It is a vocal bird with a repeated loud dwip call. There are more than 20 subspecies in three main groups; birds in {{the west of the}} range have orange-buff underparts and a white throat, those in Russia have whitish underparts, and those in the Far East have a similar appearance to European birds, but lack the white throat.|$|E
5|$|This nuthatch's {{responses}} to predators {{may be linked}} to a reproductive strategy. A study compared the white-breasted <b>nuthatch</b> with the red-breasted <b>nuthatch</b> in terms of the willingness of males to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of predators. The models were of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, and a house wren, which destroys eggs. The white-breasted <b>nuthatch</b> is shorter-lived than the red-breasted <b>nuthatch,</b> but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk. This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities, while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of their larger broods.|$|E

5|$|All <b>nuthatches</b> nest in cavities; {{except for}} the two species of rock <b>nuthatches,</b> all use tree holes, making a simple cup lined with soft {{materials}} on which to rest eggs. In some species the lining consists of small woody objects such as bark flakes and seed husks, while in others it includes the moss, grass, hair and feathers typical of passerine birds.|$|R

5|$|Krüper's <b>nuthatch</b> is {{threatened}} by urbanisation and development in and around mature coniferous forests, particularly in the Mediterranean coastal areas where the species was once numerous. A law promoting tourism came into force in Turkey in 2003, further exacerbating the threats to their habitat. The law reduced bureaucracy and {{made it easier for}} developers to build tourism facilities and summer houses in the coastal zone where woodland loss is a growing problem for the <b>nuthatch.</b>|$|E
5|$|Members of the red-breasted <b>nuthatch</b> {{superspecies}} excavate {{their own}} tree holes, although most other nuthatches use natural holes or old woodpecker nests. Several species {{reduce the size}} of the entrance hole and seal up cracks with mud. The red-breasted <b>nuthatch</b> makes the nest secure by daubing sticky conifer resin globules around the entrance, the male applying the resin outside and the female inside. The resin may deter predators or competitors (the resident birds avoid the resin by diving straight through the entrance hole). The white-breasted <b>nuthatch</b> smears blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{of adult}} nuthatches include owls and diurnal {{birds of prey}} (such as sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks), and nestlings and eggs are eaten by woodpeckers, small squirrels, and {{climbing}} snakes such as the western rat snake. The white-breasted <b>nuthatch</b> responds to predators near the nest by flicking its wings while making hn-hn calls. When a bird leaves the nest hole, it wipes around the entrance with a piece of fur or vegetation; this makes it more difficult for a predator to find the nest using its sense of smell. The <b>nuthatch</b> may also smear blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities. The estimated average lifespan of this <b>nuthatch</b> is two years, but the record is twelve years and nine months.|$|E

5|$|The {{fossil record}} {{for this group}} appears to be {{restricted}} to a foot bone of an early Miocene bird from Bavaria which {{has been identified as}} an extinct representative of the climbing Certhioidea, a clade comprising the treecreepers, wallcreeper and <b>nuthatches.</b> It has been described as Certhiops rummeli. Two fossil species have been described in the Sitta genus: S. cuvieri Gervais, 1852 and S. senogalliensis Portis, 1888, but probably not belong to <b>nuthatches.</b>|$|R
5|$|The white-breasted <b>nuthatch</b> (Sitta carolinensis) {{is a small}} {{songbird}} of the <b>nuthatch</b> family which breeds in old-growth woodland {{across much}} of temperate North America. It is a stocky bird, with a large head, short tail, powerful bill, and strong feet. The upperparts are pale blue-gray, and the face and underparts are white. It has a black cap and a chestnut lower belly. The nine subspecies differ mainly in {{the color of the}} body plumage.|$|E
5|$|This <b>nuthatch</b> is omnivorous, eating {{insects and}} seeds. It places large food {{items such as}} acorns or hickory nuts in crevices in tree trunks, and then hammers them open with its strong beak; surplus seeds are cached under loose bark or crevices of trees. The diet in winter may be nearly 70% seeds, but in summer it is mainly insects. The insects {{consumed}} by the white-breasted <b>nuthatch</b> include caterpillars, ants, and pest species such as pine weevils, oystershell and other scale insects, and jumping plant lice. This bird will occasionally feed on the ground, and readily visits feeding stations for nuts, suet and sunflower seeds, the last of which it often takes away to store. The white-breasted <b>nuthatch</b> was also observed visiting raccoon latrines {{in order to find}} seeds.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{will take}} over Eurasian <b>nuthatch</b> nest holes, reducing their breeding success. This {{is most likely to}} occur if the nest is high in a tree and there is a good local breeding density of the <b>nuthatch.</b> Introduced ring-necked parakeets may also compete with Eurasian nuthatches for nesting holes. The parakeets tend to occur in fragmented urban woodlands, while nuthatches prefer large old oak woodlands, which reduces the level of competition. Ornithologists conducting a 2010 Belgian study suggested that the problem was not so severe as to warrant culling of the parakeets.|$|E
