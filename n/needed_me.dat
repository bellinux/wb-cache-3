[...] In 2001 Steve Stevens was asked if Idol's declining popularity and the failure of Cyberpunk was related to their split.

500|$|In April, Speer's rivals {{for power}} succeeded in having him {{deprived}} {{of responsibility for}} construction. Speer sent Hitler a bitter letter, concluding with an offer of his resignation. Judging Speer indispensable to the war effort, Field Marshal Erhard Milch persuaded Hitler {{to try to get}} his minister to reconsider. Hitler sent Milch to Speer with a message not addressing the dispute but instead stating that he still regarded Speer as highly as ever. According to Milch, upon hearing the message, Speer burst out, [...] "The Führer can kiss my ass!" [...] After a lengthy argument, Milch persuaded Speer to withdraw his offer of resignation, on the condition his powers were restored. On April23, 1944, Speer went to see Hitler who agreed that [...] "everything [...] stay as it was, [...] remain the head of all German construction". According to Speer, while he was successful in this debate, Hitler had also won, [...] "because he wanted and <b>needed</b> <b>me</b> back in his corner, and he got me".|$|E

2500|$|Windsor-Smith was {{the chief}} {{designer}} of the [...] "Unity" [...] crossover storyline for Valiant Comics, and writer and artist {{for most of the}} first dozen issues of the title Archer and Armstrong. By focusing on storytelling and innovative marketing practices such as a tightly knit continuity, crossovers and send away issues Valiant quickly became a considerable success story, selling nearly two million copies of premiere issues and rapidly becoming the third largest comics publisher in the US, behind the long-time industry leaders Marvel and DC Comics. However, in 1993 Windsor-Smith once again found himself in opposition to company employment policies when Valiant decided to adopt the same work for hire practices that he had disliked in Marvel Comics, and became dissatisfied with his position in the company: [...] "They <b>needed</b> <b>me</b> as a figurehead just as much as a creator." [...] He left Valiant soon after Jim Shooter's departure from the company. Smith has called work-for-hire contracts [...] "a legal but unethical instrument designed to rape and plunder young talents of every possible prerogative they would otherwise possess if they had the fortune to work for more scrupulous, morally invested, publishers." ...|$|E
