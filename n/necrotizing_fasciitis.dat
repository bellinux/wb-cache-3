5|$|Parizeau's stance created {{opposition}} in the sovereignty movement, which coalesced around Bloc Québécois leader Lucien Bouchard. A popular and charismatic figure, Bouchard had come close to death from <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis</b> and lost his left leg. His recovery, and subsequent public appearances on crutches, provided a rallying point for sovereigntists and the public at large. Bouchard thought a proposal lacking a partnership would doom the project among soft nationalists (such as himself) who worried about the economic consequences of separation.|$|E
25|$|Mucormycosis, a rare fungal {{infection}} that can present like <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Treatment for <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis</b> {{may involve}} an {{interdisciplinary}} care team. For example, {{in the case}} of a <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis</b> involving the head and neck, the team could include otolaryngologists, speech pathologists, intensivists, infectious disease specialists, and plastic surgeons or oral and maxillofacial surgeons. Maintaining strict asepsis during any surgical procedure and regional anaesthesia techniques is vital in preventing the occurrence of the disease.|$|E
25|$|A 68-year-old {{man died}} from septicemia and <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis</b> after a wound was licked by his dog.|$|E
25|$|Other {{conditions}} {{that can result}} in symptoms similar to the blistering form include other bullous skin diseases, burns, and <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Common organisms include Group AStreptococcus(group A strep),Klebsiella,Clostridium,Escherichia coli,Staphylococcus aureus,andAeromonas hydrophila, and others. Group A strep is {{considered}} {{the most common cause}} of <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|As per the {{derivation}} {{study of}} the LRINEC score, a score of ≥6 is a reasonable cut-off to rule in <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis,</b> but a LRINEC <6 does not completely rule out the diagnosis. Diagnoses of severe cellulitis or abscess should also be considered due to similar presentations. 10% of patients with <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis</b> in the original study still had a LRINEC score <6. But a validation study showed that patients with a LRINEC score ≥6 have {{a higher rate of}} both mortality and amputation.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{during his}} second cabinet, Balkenende was {{diagnosed}} with <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis.</b> He was treated through surgical debridement and made a full recovery after several weeks in hospital.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, a woman {{died from}} flesh-eating {{bacteria}} (<b>Necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis)</b> that she contracted from the St. Johns River. Two or three cases are typically {{reported in the}} county each year.|$|E
25|$|<b>Necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis</b> affects about 0.4 {{in every}} 100,000 people {{per year in}} the United States. In some areas of the world it is as common as 1 in every 100,000 people.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{septic shock}} {{are treated with}} {{antimicrobial}} drugs to treat the causative infection. Some sources of infection require surgical intervention including <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis,</b> cholangitis, abscess, intestinal ischemia, or infected medical devices.|$|E
25|$|In <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis,</b> {{aggressive}} surgical debridement (removal {{of infected}} tissue) is always {{necessary to keep}} it from spreading and is the only treatment available. Diagnosis is confirmed by visual examination of the tissues and by tissue samples sent for microscopic evaluation.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{people with}} <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis</b> {{typically}} have a fever and appear sick. Mortality rates are {{as high as}} 73% if left untreated. Without surgery and medical assistance, such as antibiotics, the infection will rapidly progress and will eventually lead to death.|$|E
25|$|<b>Necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis</b> (NF), {{commonly}} known as flesh-eating disease, is an infection that results {{in the death of}} the body's soft tissue. It is a severe disease of sudden onset that spreads rapidly. Symptoms include red or purple skin in the affected area, severe pain, fever, and vomiting. The most commonly affected areas are the limbs and perineum.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat), certain Streptococcus species {{are responsible for}} many cases of pink eye, meningitis, bacterial pneumonia, endocarditis, erysipelas, and <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis</b> (the 'flesh-eating' bacterial infections). However, many streptococcal species are not pathogenic, and form part of the commensal human microbiota of the mouth, skin, intestine, and upper respiratory tract. Furthermore, streptococci are a necessary ingredient in producing Emmentaler ("Swiss") cheese.|$|E
25|$|The {{clinical}} presentation among invasive disease is also dominated by skin and soft tissue infections, including a small subset of patients presenting with severe <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis.</b> Moreover, {{it is an}} important cause of bone and joint infections, and this disease manifestation is reported to be increasing. Less commonly it can present as pneumonia, endocarditis, genital or intraabdominal infections. Primary bacteraemia, infection without identifiable focal origin, comprises approximately 20% of the reported cases.|$|E
25|$|The {{invasive}} infections {{caused by}} group A β-hemolytic streptococci {{tend to be}} more severe and less common. This occurs when the bacterium is able to infect areas where it is not usually found, such as the blood and the organs. The diseases that may be caused include streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis,</b> pneumonia, and bacteremia. Globally, GAS has been estimated to cause more than 500,000 deaths every year, {{making it one of the}} world's leading pathogens.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{debridement}} (cutting away affected tissue) is {{the mainstay}} of treatment for <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis.</b> Early medical treatment is often presumptive; thus, antibiotics should be started {{as soon as this}} condition is suspected. Given the dangerous nature of the disease, a high index of suspicion is needed. Initial treatment often includes a combination of intravenous antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and clindamycin. Cultures are taken to determine appropriate antibiotic coverage, and antibiotics may be changed when culture results are obtained.|$|E
25|$|In adults, {{the disease}} is more severe, though the {{incidence}} is much less common. Infection in adults is associated with greater morbidity and mortality due to pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia), bronchitis (either viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis), hepatitis, and encephalitis. In particular, up to 10% of pregnant women with chickenpox develop pneumonia, the severity of which increases with onset later in gestation. In England and Wales, 75% of deaths due to chickenpox are in adults. Inflammation of the brain, or encephalitis, can occur in immunocompromised individuals, although the risk is higher with herpes zoster. <b>Necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis</b> is also a rare complication.|$|E
25|$|The {{legs and}} face {{are the most}} common sites involved, though {{cellulitis}} can occur on any part of the body. The leg is typically affected following a break in the skin. Other risk factors include obesity, leg swelling, and old age. For facial infections, a break in the skin beforehand is not usually the case. The bacteria most commonly involved are streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. In contrast to cellulitis, erysipelas is a bacterial infection involving the more superficial layers of the skin, present with an area of redness with well-defined edges, and more often is associated with a fever. Diagnosis is usually based on the presenting signs and symptoms, while cell culture is rarely possible. Before making a diagnosis, more serious infections such as an underlying bone infection or <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis</b> should be ruled out.|$|E
25|$|Mucormycosis is {{commonly}} contracted via inhalation of spores resulting in rhinocerebral and pulmonary mucormycoses but infection with Apophysomyces variabilis is contracted cutaneously. Apophysomyces species cause infections {{of the skin}} and soft-tissue following injuries such as burns, automotive accidents, surgeries, and injections both intramuscular and subcutaneous. Cutaneous mucormycosis is acquired when the sporangiospores from contaminated soil and water {{come into contact with}} broken skin. For this reason, disease is seen in burn patients, injured persons, and injection-drug users. The infection may take clinical forms such as <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis,</b> cerebritis, rhinoorbital infections, and kidney infections. Successful treatment depends on early detection of infection, surgical debridement of necrotic tissues, and anti-fungal therapy with drugs such as posaconazole and amphotericin B. Members of the order Mucorales generally infect immunocompromised patients but A. variabilis infections tend to occur in immunocompetent healthy hosts.|$|E
25|$|Registrar Antoine Malick (Jimmy Akingbola) {{begins a}} rivalry with Dan after he {{undermines}} {{him over the}} treatment of a patient. Tensions build when he learns that Malick is gay. He secretly treats his injured rugby team mate Sean Foster (Sam Callis) with steroids. Malick and Chrissie criticise his actions and Malick threatens to report him. Sean develops <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis</b> as a result and Dan is forced to operate, ruining Sean's career. A fight ensues between the two and Dan kisses Malick. He then runs to Chrissie and confesses his love for her. Dan asks Malick to forget the kiss and attempts to avoid him. They are forced to operate together. Dan undermines him in theatre, the pair fight once more. After more competitiveness, Dan ignores Malick's medical advice dangering a patient. Malick is angered by his attitude and punches Dan, injuring {{his face in the}} process.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked in}} May 2011 if Slayer {{was going to}} make a {{follow-up}} to World Painted Blood, then-Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo replied that, although nothing had been written yet, there were [...] "definitely plans." [...] In early 2011, guitarist Jeff Hanneman contracted <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis.</b> Reports linked this illness with a spider bite he claimed to have received while in a friend's hot tub. When asked about a new record, bassist Tom Araya stated that any work would have to wait until Hanneman had recovered.|$|E
500|$|From late 2010 {{until his}} death in May 2013, Jeff Hanneman's {{participation}} in Slayer was minimal. In January 2011, he contracted <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis,</b> which severely restricted his ability to perform. He appeared publicly with the band on only one known occasion, playing two songs during an encore at one of Slayer's Big 4 performances in April 2011; he also attended rehearsals for Fun Fun Fun Fest in November 2011, but did not end up performing at this show. By July 2012, Hanneman had not written or recorded any new material for the band's follow up to 2009's World Painted Blood. In February 2013, Kerry King stated he was planning on recording all of the guitar parts for the upcoming album himself, but was open to Hanneman's return if he was willing and able. King also denied that Gary Holt, member of Exodus and Hanneman's live fill-in, would write or record anything for the upcoming album. Hanneman died on May 2, 2013 at the age of 49 due to liver failure.|$|E
500|$|In early 2011, Hanneman {{contracted}} <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis.</b> According to the band, {{doctors say}} that it likely originated from a spider bite. Araya said of Hanneman's condition: [...] "Jeff was seriously ill. Jeff ended up contracting a bacteria that ate away his flesh on his arm, so they cut open his arm, from his wrist to his shoulder, and they did a skin graft on him, they cleaned up ... It was a flesh-eating virus, so he was really, really bad. So we'll {{wait for him to}} get better, and when he's a hundred percent, he's gonna come out and join us." [...] The band decided to play their upcoming tour dates without Hanneman. Gary Holt of Exodus was announced as Hanneman's temporary replacement. Cannibal Corpse guitarist Pat O'Brien filled in for Holt during a tour in Europe. On April 23, 2011, at the American Big 4 show in Indio, California, Hanneman rejoined his bandmates to play the final two songs of their set, [...] "South of Heaven" [...] and [...] "Angel of Death."This was Hanneman's final live performance with the band.|$|E
2500|$|The Laboratory Risk Indicator for <b>Necrotizing</b> <b>Fasciitis</b> (LRINEC) score can be {{utilized}} to risk stratify people having signs of cellulitis {{to determine the}} likelihood of <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis</b> being present. It uses six serologic measures: C-reactive protein, total white blood cell count, hemoglobin, sodium, creatinine and glucose. A score {{greater than or equal}} to 6 indicates that <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis</b> should be seriously considered. The scoring criteria are as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis</b> affects 0.4 to 1 {{person per}} 100,000 per year. Both sexes are {{affected}} equally. It becomes {{more common among}} older people and is very rare in children. <b>Necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis</b> has been described {{at least since the}} time of Hippocrates. The term [...] "necrotising fasciitis" [...] first came into use in 1952.|$|E
2500|$|Fournier gangrene, {{another name}} for <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis</b> of the groin region ...|$|E
2500|$|In rare cases, the {{infection}} can {{spread to the}} deep layer of tissue called the fascial lining. <b>Necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis,</b> also called by the media [...] "flesh-eating bacteria", {{is an example of}} a deep-layer infection. It is a medical emergency.|$|E
2500|$|... 2014 Daniel Gildenlöw, Swedish {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} {{for the band}} Pain of Salvation spent several months in hospital after being diagnosed with <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis</b> {{on his back in}} early 2014. After recovering he went to write the album 'In the Passing Light of Day', a concept album about his experience during the hospitalization.|$|E
2500|$|Antibiotics {{are usually}} prescribed, with the agent {{selected}} based on suspected organism and {{presence or absence of}} purulence, although the best treatment choice is unclear. [...] If an abscess is also present, surgical drainage is usually indicated, with antibiotics often prescribed for co-existent cellulitis, especially if extensive. [...] Pain relief is also often prescribed, but excessive pain should always be investigated, as it is a symptom of <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis.</b> [...] Elevation of the affected area is often recommended.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2014 interview, Rickles {{dismissed}} {{thoughts of}} retiring, saying: [...] "I'm in good health. I'm working better than I ever have. The audiences are great. Why should I retire? I'm like a fighter. The bell rings {{and you come}} out and fight. My energy comes alive. And I still enjoy it." [...] Until his death in 2017, despite being impeded by multiple surgeries following a bout with <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis</b> in 2013, Rickles continued touring across the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{diagnosis}} is difficult as the disease often looks early {{on like a}} simple superficial skin infection. While a number of laboratory and imaging modalities can raise the suspicion for <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis,</b> {{the gold standard for}} {{diagnosis is}} a surgical exploration in the setting of high suspicion. When in doubt, a small [...] "keyhole" [...] incision can be made into the affected tissue, and if a finger easily separates the tissue along the fascial plane, the diagnosis is confirmed and an extensive debridement should be performed.|$|E
2500|$|... 2014 Don Rickles (d. April 6, 2017), an American {{stand-up}} comedian, revealed on The Late Show with David Letterman on 2 May 2014 that he {{had contracted}} <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis</b> on his right leg. [...] His doctor came over to his house for a visit and noticed a sore on Don's leg. After examining it he sent him straight to the hospital. [...] Treatment was successful, though he required a cane {{for a short period}} of time. If it had progressed further, Don quipped, he would have wound up with Johnny Depp as a one legged pirate.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{conditions}} that may mimic cellulitis include deep vein thrombosis, {{which can be}} diagnosed with a compression leg ultrasound, and stasis dermatitis, which is {{inflammation of the skin}} from poor blood flow. [...] Signs of a more severe infection such as <b>necrotizing</b> <b>fasciitis</b> or gas gangrene that would require prompt surgical intervention include purple bullae, skin sloughing, subcutaneous edema, and systemic toxicity. Misdiagnosis can occur in up to 30% of people with suspected lower-extremity cellulitis, leading to 50,000 to 130,000 unnecessary hospitalization and $195 to $515 million in avoidable healthcare spending annually in the United States.|$|E
