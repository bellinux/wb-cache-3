Asymmetric two-beam coupling was observed at 633 nm, and a gain coefficient of 18 cm(- 1) was measured at an externally applied field of 48 V mu m(- 1). status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{lifetime}} prediction {{study is}} carried out on four triple base propellant compositions by artificial ageing. The ageing effects are studied with High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Heat Flow Calorimetry (HFC) {{in order to find}} the most effective stabilizer and to evaluate {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} both methods. It is observed that the Ethyl Centralite (EC) and Akardite II stabilized compositions are less affected by the artificial ageing than the Diphenylamine (DPA) and <b>N-Methyl-p-Nitroaniline</b> (MNA) stabilized compositions. The DPA- and the MNA-stabilized propellants are not considered to be safe for the next 10 years based on the HPLC results. Based on the HFC results the DPA-stabilized propellant will also be expected to be safe for a period of ten years. HFC is considered as the best way to determine the propellants lifetime, because the method measures the most important effect of ageing, i. e. the heat generation rate of all chemical processes which occur. The heat generation rate gives an indication of the decrease in calorific value as well as the self-heating potential. HPLC measures the stabilizer and stabilizer derivative content. This only gives an indication of the time that the stabilizer will be present in the composition, but does not provide data of the consumed energy or information on the self-heating potential during the evaluation period. Stabilizing effects of stabilizer derivatives may be neglected in HPLC analysis resulting in an underestimation of the safe lifetime. © 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this work, conductor-like {{screening}} for real solvents (COSMO-RS) calculations {{were carried out}} using COSMOtherm program in conjunction with Gaussian 03 packages. The objective was to predict thermodynamic properties for two nitrogen-rich energetic materials which are less harmful for the environment than the conventional ones, namely 3, 6 -di(hydrazino) - 1, 2, 4, 5 - tetrazine (DHT) and 3, 3 ’-azo-bis(6 -amino- 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrazine) (DAAT) for which no experimental data are available to our best knowledge. COSMO-RS approach {{is a combination of}} quantum chemical and statistical thermodynamic basis, which allow a physically meaningful description of molecular interactions between pure molecules and solvents in solution. Recently, this approach has been used for the prediction of an enormous number of physicochemical properties especially aqueous solubility, Henry’s law constant, vapor pressure and partition coefficient. The vapor pressure of pure compounds {{is one of the most}} important thermodynamic properties required for the chemical process design as well as for the fate assessment of pollutants in the environment. To validate the accuracy of COSMO-RS approach for the two molecules of interest, six reference energetic molecules have been studied, for which experimental data are available, such as cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (HMX), 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT), cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 -hexanitro- 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 -hexaazaisowurtzitane (CL- 20), 1, 1 -diamino- 2, 2 -dinitroethylene (FOX- 7) and <b>n-methyl-p-nitroaniline</b> (MNA). From predicted results, a good agreement has been noted. DAAT molecule shows a lower volatility in the medium so that a low detectability compared to the DHT and other reference molecules. Both DHT and DAAT showed negative logarithmic values of Octanol-Water partition coefficients, this means that they don’t have the tendency to enhance the bioaccumulation process in soils...|$|E
