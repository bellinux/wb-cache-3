50|$|Although Eurocontrol is not {{an agency}} of the European Union, the EU has {{delegated}} parts of its Single European Sky regulations to Eurocontrol, making it the central organization for coordination and planning of air traffic control for all of Europe. The EU itself is a signatory of Eurocontrol and all EU member states are presently also members of Eurocontrol. The organization works with national authorities, air navigation service providers, civil and military airspace users, airports, and other organisations. Its activities involve all gate-to-gate air navigation service operations: strategic and tactical flow management, controller training, regional control of airspace, safety-proofed technologies and procedures, and collection of air <b>navigation</b> <b>charges.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Also on August 16, the Curacao Parliament {{discussed}} {{the ramifications of}} Dutch Antilles Express falling into bankruptcy and the economic impact that such an event would have on Curacao. The reviewed finances of the company were reviewed in a closed session and the Parliament decided to decline further assistance to the airline {{by a vote of}} 9-9, with 3 absences (simple majority required to pass). [...] The next day, DAE was prevented from using the check-in services of Curacao Hato Airport for a short time and admitted that services to Bonaire had been canceled as of the week before due to non-payment of <b>navigation</b> <b>charges.</b>|$|R
50|$|The CAAF functioned like a {{government}} department, {{but had a}} mixture of statutory responsibilities and commercial obligations. Effectively, it was a referee and a player in its own game. For the 20 {{years prior to the}} restructuring, it had been making annual profits. This was largely because its annual revenue growth was directly linked to the expansion of the international tourism industry in Fiji. Income was derived from landing and parking fees, air <b>navigation</b> <b>charges,</b> passenger service charges, terminal building concessions and rentals, fuel concessions, and the sale of excess power. It was exempt from income tax until the reform. Only minor investments were made into infrastructure. It received heavy financial assistance {{in the form of an}} annual government grant to run Nausori airport and the other loss-making airports.|$|R
50|$|Postwar {{discussion}} of the Danube River was begun by the United States in 1945 when President Truman proposed at the Potsdam Conference that freedom of navigation should be assured on Europe's inland waterways. Britain and France were concerned with reestablishing their prewar positions {{as members of the}} European Commission of the Danube.In 1947, the Paris peace treaties signed with Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria guaranteed free navigation.The foreign ministers of Britain, France, the USSR, and the United States stipulated that:Navigation on the Danube shall be free and open for the nationals, vessels of commerce and goods of all states, on a footing of equality in regard to port and <b>navigation</b> <b>charges</b> and conditions for merchant shipping. The foregoing shall not apply to traffic between ports of the same state.|$|R
40|$|Air routes {{are largely}} {{determined}} by the interaction of geographical, political, economic and social factors. And airlines use their aircraft for a diversity of missions. Because of both factors the actual utilization of transport aircraft is well inside the payload-range envelope, {{which means that the}} designs are oversized for most flights. The objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the savings that could be achieved if transport aircraft were designed for shorter ranges; i. e., closer to the actual utilization pattern. In this design scenario, the maximum take-off weight and the operating empty weight would be remarkably reduced. This would lead to a reduction in aircraft price, trip fuel, maintenance cost, and landing and <b>navigation</b> <b>charges</b> as well as environmental impact. Direct operating cost as will be used as figure of merit of the reduced range approach...|$|R
50|$|To {{make the}} routes viable for {{commercial}} airlines, the union government offers flexible code sharing arrangements, reduced excise on value-added tax on fuel and service tax.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine the impact of <b>navigation</b> user <b>charges</b> on grain shipped on the Missouri River. Chapter 1 provides background information on water transportation. The Missouri River is part of the Mississippi River System and the most important commercial product shipped on the river is grain. ^ Chapter 2 discusses the <b>navigation</b> user <b>charge</b> controversy. Beginning with the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, our nation has had a policy of waterways free of any tax or duty. However, in 1978, Congress passed legislation imposing a uniform tax on diesel fuel consumed by towboats and the tax is expected to recover 20 to 25 percent of the costs attributable to commercial navigation. But Congress is considering legislation that imposes a higher level of recovery, evoking considerable debate and lobbying. Those in favor of <b>navigation</b> user <b>charges</b> feel that full recovery of Federal expenditures is equitable and would increase economic efficiency. The opponents of the tax disagree and also argue that the public or social benefits of commercial navigation are great enough to warrant subsidization of our inland waterways. ^ Chapter 3 discusses the major types of <b>navigation</b> user <b>charges</b> and methods of collection. Then the level of taxation required to recover the operation and maintenance expenditures allocated to commercial navigation by the U. S. Army Crops of Engineers is calculated. ^ In Chapter 4, the impact of the tax on Missouri River grain traffic is analyzed. Utilizing the aforementioned level of taxation, the increase in transportation cost of shipping grain is ascertained. Then the added transportation cost is compared to the transportation rate savings, and since the rate savings are less than the added transportation cost, the grain traffic will be diverted. ^ It is concluded in Chapter 5 that the loss of grain traffic may result in the closing of the Missouri River to commercial barge traffic. The decline in farm income due to the closing of the Missouri River is then determined. Finally, it is decided that additional research needs to be conducted. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{provisions}} of the Commission Regulation no. 1794 / 2006 of 6 December 2006 laying down a common charging scheme for air navigation services. In the European Commission’s opinion the development of a common charging scheme for air navigation services provided during all phases of flight is important for the implementation of the Single European Sky. This scheme should be based on common harmonized rules and should improve economic efficiency. Three are the main principles of the charging scheme: remuneration, transparency and no discrimination. The analysis of the most significant provisions of the Regulation no. 1794 / 2006 (mechanism for calculating cost and <b>charges</b> of air <b>navigation</b> services, exemption of some type of services from air <b>navigation</b> <b>charges,</b> incentives) shows that the objectives have not been fully achieved. In fact, since the publication of this paper, the Regulation has been substantially modified...|$|R
40|$|Between 2002 and 2005, Lufthansa, Swiss and KLM in {{cooperation}} with PrivatAir, start-up airlines Eos and MAXjet individually, launched scheduled business class-only services between Europe and the US. This paper qualitatively analyses the new business model from the strategic and operational point of view. Different approaches based on pull or push motivation have been identified and {{the characteristics of the}} service offerings extensively examined. From the strategic aspect, the analysis has proven that the products have an inherent value benefit for the respective target group. It has been established that short and ultra-long haul routes are not viable for the business model. The main shortcoming of the offering is the lack of connectivity as opposed to network carriers, resulting in dependency on the local demand. For the start-up airlines, establishment of market presence and goodwill is critical. In the area of operating economics, pilot crew and <b>navigation</b> <b>charges</b> have a higher impact than in the mixed class operation. Airport charges and administrative overhead build a larger portion of total expenses in case of traditional airline services. No significant evidence against the viability of the premium airline model could be found.

50|$|Flight {{permits are}} permits or {{permission}} required by an aircraft to overfly, land {{or make a}} technical stop in any country's airspace. All countries have their own regulations regarding issuance of flight permits as there is generally a payment involved. The charges normally payable would be the Route <b>Navigation</b> Facility <b>Charges</b> or RNFC for overflights and also Landing & Parking charges in case of aircraft making halts. The procedure for issuance of these permits also varies from country to country. More details regarding these can be taken from the respective country's Civil Aviation websites.|$|R

50|$|When Harold Holt {{replaced}} Menzies {{as prime}} minister on 26 January 1966, McMahon defeated (Sir) Paul Hasluck for the deputy leadership. As deputy, he was also treasurer (1966-69)—the post he had always wanted. He developed good relationships with his department—which contained a number of highly skilled economists—and was appointed a governor (1966-69) of the International Monetary Fund and chairman (1968-69) {{of the board of}} governors of the Asian Development Bank. Extensive knowledge of his portfolio, his understanding of economics, his inquisition of public servants and his desire to keep control of expenditure often made him unpopular, but these qualities boosted his reputation as a treasurer. He introduced four budgets, gradually reducing the deficit from $644 million in 1967-68 to $30 million in 1969-70. They were characterised by significant increased spending on defence, drought assistance, pension benefits and grants to the States, and by new Commonwealth programs for the health, education and housing of Aborigines, and for school libraries. Funding came from increased company and sales tax rates, radio and television licence fees, air <b>navigation</b> <b>charges</b> and overseas borrowings. Together with (Sir) John Gorton, he tried to resist State demands for extra revenue. Relations between the Treasury and the Department of Trade were strained even when Holt was treasurer. When McMahon became treasurer his relationship with McEwen deteriorated further. They clashed over industry protection, McMahon’s opposition to the establishment of the Australian Industry Development Corporation and his (ultimately vindicated) decision not to devalue the Australian dollar. McEwen accused McMahon of being behind the Basic Industries Group, a pro-free-trade agricultural lobby that funded Western Australian and Victorian Liberals to stand against Country Party members. The governor-general, R. G. (Lord) Casey, met with McMahon to encourage him to heal relations with McEwen, but there were persistent tensions that the affable Holt found difficult to manage.|$|R
50|$|Without {{the use of}} {{navigation}} aids such as the astrolabe, compass and modern navigation equipment, early sailors and navigators relied upon the raven or crow to determine where the closest land lay when no land was in clear sight. As a bird was released, a dead reckoning course would be set. As ships grew in size and complexity, that station became to be mounted on the highest mast of the oceangoing vessel, and {{it came to be}} known as the crow's nest. The simplest construction to providing a lookout and setting course direction for the ship was to lash a barrel to the mast. A member of the crew experienced in the matters of <b>navigation</b> was <b>charged</b> with manning this perch and became to be colloquially known as a barrelman.|$|R
2500|$|Parliament {{decided that}} five Avinor {{airports}} {{would be allowed}} to issue ninety percent discount on take-off charges on international routes. This accounted in 2004 to NOK4,800 per flight for a Boeing 737-200. However, they still had to pay full terminal, security and air <b>navigation</b> service <b>charges.</b> This allowed Haugesund to establish itself as a [...] "low-cost" [...] airport for low-cost carriers. Ryanair started looking at Haugesund as a destination in 2002, hoping to serve both Rogaland and Hordaland from one airport. However, they demanded that the runway be lengthened if they were to use Karmøy. It launched its inaugural daily route to London Stansted Airport on 30 April 2003. By using the smaller Boeing 737-200 aircraft the airline could as an interim solution get by with the short runway—the shortest of any airport served by the airline.|$|R
