25|$|The {{population}} of the city doubled in the 1830s with an influx of settlers. A few newcomers to the city were friends of the Marquis de Lafayette who had settled in the newly founded city of Tallahassee, Florida, but due to legalities had lost their deeds. One <b>new</b> <b>settler</b> who was not displaced but chose to move to New Orleans to practice law was Prince Achille Murat, nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte. According to historian Paul Lachance, “the addition of white immigrants to the white creole population enabled French-speakers to remain {{a majority of the}} white population until almost 1830. If a substantial proportion of free persons of color and slaves had not also spoken French, however, the Gallic community would have become a minority of the total population as early as 1820.” Large numbers of German and Irish immigrants began arriving at this time. The {{population of}} the city doubled in the 1830s and by 1840 New Orleans had become the wealthiest and third-most populous city in the nation.|$|E
25|$|The militia of Harrison County was {{organized}} into {{a company of}} sixty men commanded by Captain Spier Spencer, the county sheriff. Spencer was a veteran of at least forty prior engagements with Native Americans. The second in command was 1st Lieutenant Richard McMahan, a <b>new</b> <b>settler</b> living near Corydon. The company had four sergeants and four corporals, one of each from each township in the county. Among them was Pearse Chamberlain, Henry Batman, and William Pennington, the younger brother of Dennis Pennington {{the speaker of the}} territorial legislature. Dennis Pennington was {{also a member of the}} company, but was unable to make the expedition because he was overseeing the construction of the new county courthouse and had to attend a meeting of the legislature who were called into an emergency session. The company had eight ensigns including future U.S. Senator John Tipton. Tipton kept a detailed journal of the company's activities and it is from that source that most knowledge of the company is known. The company contained two musicians, Daniel Cline serving as a drummer and Isham Stroud as a fifer. Both boys were fifteen years old, the youngest men in the company. There were forty-three privates enlisted, including many of the prominent men in the county.|$|E

Oliver Seccombe, angered by threats to his interests, engages {{the services of a}} gang of outlaws to kill Brumbaugh, Garrett and other leaders of the farmers and shepherds. [...] Jim Lloyd and John Skimmerhorn find themselves caught between sides in the war. [...] They are cowboys but are also sympathetic to the plight of the farmers and shepherds and refuse to believe that Seccombe is behind the cold blooded killings. [...] Brumbaugh and Garrett both survive assassination attempts but several farmers and shepherds are killed in the violence. [...] Eventually the outlaws are ambushed by a group of vigilantes led by Brumbaugh and Jim Lloyd. [...] The sheriff is able to restore order but several gang members escape vowing vengeance.|$|E

2500|$|On 10 January 2014, Israel {{approved}} {{plans for}} 1,400 settler homes. Saeb Erekat responded by saying [...] "The recent announcement shows Israel's clear {{commitment to the}} destruction of peace efforts and the imposition of an apartheid regime". Tzipi Livni, who also opposed <b>new</b> <b>settler</b> homes, was responded by Israeli politician Ze'ev Elkin, who suggested the settlements were vital for Israel's security: [...] "The path that Livni recommends means we will have to say goodbye to our security," [...] he said. On 14 January, Israel's defense minister Moshe Ya'alon rejected the negotiations and insulted John Kerry, saying he was acting based upon [...] "messianic feeling", and that [...] "The only thing that can 'save' us is that John Kerry will get a Nobel Peace Prize and leave us alone." [...] Yuval Steinitz, another members of the Likud, expressed general agreement with Ya'alon's views, but disagreed with the personal insult. However, Yaalon later issued an official apology in a written statement sent to media from the Defense Ministry. On 18 January, Israel's finance minister Yair Lapid threatened to take his party, Yesh Atid, out of the coalition if peace talks did not advance. This would topple the current government and force either the formation of a new coalition, or early elections.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 January 2014, Israel {{announced}} plans for 381 <b>new</b> <b>settler</b> homes in the West Bank. The Palestinians condemned this move, and also ruled {{out the possibility of}} the peace talks extending beyond the nine-month deadline. On 22 January, Abbas said he would like Russia to take {{a more active role in}} the negotiations. On 27 January, the Palestinians said they would not allow [...] "a single settler" [...] to remain in a Palestinian state, but that this did not stem from anti-Jewish attitudes. Rather, Jews living in the West Bank would have the option of remaining if they renounced their Israeli citizenship and applied to be citizens of Palestine. A poll has shown that 4.5% of Jewish settlers would consider becoming Palestinian citizens under such an arrangement. On 31 January, according to Martin Indyk, the framework for the US-backed Middle East peace deal will allow up to 80 per cent of Jewish settlers to remain in the West Bank. The deal would redraw borders so that some 80 per cent of settlers' homes would be redesignated as being in Israel, while other parcels land would be handed back to Palestinian control in a proposed land-swap deal. Another key point of the framework would be that Israel would be allowed to retain a role in maintaining security along the West Bank's border with neighbouring Jordan. The new security arrangements would see a zone created with hi-tech fences equipped with sensors and drone surveillance planes flying overhead. Also the final peace treaty could also provide compensation for victims on both sides of the historic conflict.|$|E
2500|$|Post-1967 {{settlement}} was impelled by theological doctrines {{developed in the}} Mercaz HaRav Kook under both its founder Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, and his son Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook, according to which the Land of Israel is holy, the people, endowed with a divine spark, are holy, and that the messianic Age of Redemption has arrived, requiring that the Land and People be united in occupying the land and fulfilling the commandments. Hebron has a particular role in the unfolding 'cosmic drama': traditions hold that Abraham purchased land there, that King David was its king, and the tomb of Abraham covers {{the entrance to the}} Garden of Eden, and is a site excavated by Adam, who, with Eve, is buried there. Redemption will occur when the feminine and masculine characteristics of God are united at the site. Settling Hebron is not only a right and duty, but is doing the world at large a favour, with the community's acts an example of the Jews of Hebron being [...] "a light unto the nations" [...] (Or la-Goyim) [...] and bringing about their redemption, even if this means breaching secular laws, expressed in religiously motivated violence towards Palestinians, who are widely viewed as [...] "mendacious, vicious, self-centered, and impossible to trust". Clashes with Palestinians in [...] the settlement project have theological significance in the Jewish Hebron community: the frictions of war were, in Kook's view, conducive to the messianic process, and 'Arabs' will have to leave. There is no kin connection between the new settlers and the traditional Old Families of Jewish Hebronites, who vigorously oppose the <b>new</b> <b>settler</b> presence in Hebron. According to a ruling given by the Israeli Supreme Court in 2011, Jews have no right to properties they possessed in places like Hebron and Tel Rumeida before 1948, and have no right to compensation for their losses.|$|E

Teaching a pupil to read, before he enters upon the active business of life, is like giving a <b>new</b> <b>settler</b> an axe, as he goes to seek his new home in the forest. Teaching him a lesson in history, is, on the other hand, only cutting down a tree or two for him. A knowledge of natural history, is like a few bushels of grain, gratuitously placed in his barn; but the art of ready reckoning, is the plough, which will remain by him for years, and help him to draw out from the soil an annual treasure.|$|E

6000|$|At present I have to {{make the}} <b>new</b> <b>settler</b> Lydgate better known to any one {{interested}} in him than he could possibly be even to those who had seen the most of him since his arrival in Middlemarch. For surely all must admit that a man may be puffed and belauded, envied, ridiculed, counted upon as a tool and fallen in love with, or at least selected as a future husband, and yet remain virtually unknown--known merely as a cluster of signs for his neighbors' false suppositions. There was a general impression, however, that Lydgate was not altogether a common country doctor, and in Middlemarch at that time such an impression was significant of great things being expected from him. For everybody's family doctor was remarkably clever, and was understood to have immeasurable skill in the management and training of the most skittish or vicious diseases. The evidence of his cleverness was of the higher intuitive order, lying in his lady-patients' immovable conviction, and was unassailable by any objection except that their intuitions were opposed by others equally strong; each lady who saw medical truth in Wrench and [...] "the strengthening treatment" [...] regarding Toller and [...] "the lowering system" [...] as medical perdition. For the heroic times of copious bleeding and blistering had not yet departed, still less the times of thorough-going theory, when disease in general was called by some bad name, and treated accordingly without shilly-shally--as if, for example, it were to be called insurrection, which must not be fired on with blank-cartridge, but have its blood drawn at once. The strengtheners and the lowerers were all [...] "clever" [...] men in somebody's opinion, which is really as much as can be said for any living talents. Nobody's imagination had {{gone so far as to}} conjecture that Mr. Lydgate could know as much as Dr. Sprague and Dr. Minchin, the two physicians, who alone could offer any hope when danger was extreme, and when the smallest hope was worth a guinea. Still, I repeat, there was a general impression that Lydgate was something rather more uncommon than any general practitioner in Middlemarch. And this was true. He was but seven-and-twenty, an age at which many men are not quite common--at which they are hopeful of achievement, resolute in avoidance, thinking that Mammon shall never put a bit in their mouths and get astride their backs, but rather that Mammon, if they have anything to do with him, shall draw their chariot.|$|E
