5|$|Ten {{days later}} he {{received}} permission for another daylight sortie. Squadron Leader Robertson joined him on this occasion as his flight engineer. He flew to Lasham {{to pick up a}} Mosquito. His target on this occasion would be Denmark. The Luftwaffe kept a number of operational units in the region so he flew to Coltishall in Norfolk to be nearer his destination and conserve fuel during the sortie. Near Aalborg he sighted two aircraft. So far away from the battle zones, the Germans did not expect to be attacked by the enemy. Neither made much attempt to defend themselves. The first, a Junkers W 34 transport, was shot down and the second, a Junkers Ju 52, tried a crash-landing only to <b>nose-over</b> and crumple the wings. Braham strafed it to ensure destruction. His gun cameras filmed the action during which he fired 320 rounds. On 4 April he returned to France. Lacking radar, Braham sought out large airfields to be sure of intercepting an enemy aircraft. He flew to Bordeaux looking for He 177s that intelligence suggested were operating against Atlantic convoys from Bordeaux–Mérignac. Braham only encountered a Bücker Bü 131 which fell victim after a brief burst of fire.|$|E
25|$|The G.II {{carried a}} crew of three and a {{defensive}} armament of two 7.92mm (.312in) machine guns. The forward section of the fuselage was skinned in plywood, with the remainder covered in fabric. The fuselage and two very large nacelles were mounted on the lower wing. Each nacelle contained fuel and oil tanks beneath each {{of a pair of}} geared-output 160KW (220hp) Mercedes D.IV straight-eight engines, one per nacelle, driving pusher propellers. The undercarriage was unusual, being quadricycle in arrangement with a pair of wheels mounted at the front and rear of each engine nacelle. This feature was intended to remove the possibility of a <b>nose-over</b> on landing. In fact, the nacelles and undercarriage constituted fully self-contained, wheeled units intended to facilitate construction and maintenance. The entire aircraft was intended to be easily dismantled so that fuselage, engines, and wings would easily fit onto three railway flatcars.|$|E
500|$|In the 2000s, Dan Antoniu {{and other}} Romanian {{aviation}} experts investigated existing {{photographs of the}} Coandă-1910, leading them {{to believe that the}} aircraft presented at the exhibition was not finished, that it was exhibited with many improvisations. Antoniu published Henri Coandă and his technical work during 1906–1918, a 2010 book in which he said that the unfinished state of the aircraft led to Coandă filing several extra patents and starting a new series of studies with the aim of making the machine airworthy. For instance, Antoniu wrote that the exhaust pipes of the Clergét engine appeared free; there were no devices to redirect exhaust gases to the turbine as described in the patent, and there were no heat shields for crew protection. As well, the central attachment of the tubular struts holding the wings to the fuselage, with mere collars secured with screws, was judged by Antoniu as appearing potentially unsafe during take-off or landing because of the [...] "considerable loads on the struts". The X-shaped empennage was covered at high angles by the horizontal stabiliser making it unusable, and any high-speed taxi would put the machine in danger of a <b>nose-over.</b>|$|E

50|$|In aviation, a {{propeller}} strike, or prop strike, {{also called}} a sudden stoppage, is an accident {{in which an}} aircraft's propeller contacts any object and is forcibly stopped or slowed. Propeller strikes can {{be the result of}} the propeller contacting the ground due to landing gear collapse, failure to extend the landing gear, or <b>nose-over.</b> However, the term also includes the damage incurred from contacting any object, such as a hangar door, or even the sudden rpm loss from contacting a yielding substance such as water or heavy tall grass.|$|E
5000|$|In 1949, Cessna {{introduced}} the 140A, a new variant with aluminum-covered wings and single wing struts {{instead of the}} fabric wing covering, dual [...] "V" [...] struts, and jury struts fitted on earlier models.

The spring-steel gear had been swept 3 in forward on 120 and 140 models in late 1947 so wheel extenders were no longer necessary to counter <b>nose-over</b> tendencies during heavy application of brakes; all 140A models had the improved gear legs. Despite these improvements, sales of the 140 lineup faltered, and the 140A comprised only seven percent of overall 120/140 production.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{hallmarks}} of Martin-Baker designs was the simple but efficient installation of main systems. The clean and orderly cockpit was set well back, allowing a good view downwards behind the wing. A crash post was fitted, which automatically extended to minimise structure damage and injury to the pilot {{in the event of a}} <b>nose-over</b> landing. A small, tapered tailplane was mounted on the top of the fuselage well forward of the stern post, while the fin and rudder combination was roughly triangular in side elevation. This arrangement placed most of the effective rudder area below the tailplane, thus providing an adequate balance to the keel surface and assuring good recovery from spins. In initial MB2 configurations, there was no fin and the rudder was mounted on the fuselage but lateral stability was unsatisfactory, with the fixed fin added later.|$|E

50|$|Many {{users were}} {{impressed}} by the step up that the Baltimore represented from older aircraft like the Bristol Blenheim. The users of the Baltimore, and Martin pilot Benjamin R. Wallace, praised the aircraft for its heavy armament, structural strength, maneuverability, bombing accuracy, and relatively high performance, but crews complained of cramped conditions {{similar to those in}} the earlier Maryland bomber. Due to the narrow fuselage it was nearly impossible for crew members to change positions during flight if wounded (the structure of the interior meant that the pilot and observer were separated from the wireless operator and rear gunner). This was common for most light bombers of the era like the Handley Page Hampden, Douglas Boston, and Blenheim. Crews also complained about the difficulties in handling the aircraft on the ground. On takeoff, the pilot had to co-ordinate the throttles perfectly to avoid a <b>nose-over,</b> or worse.|$|E
50|$|Tricycle gear is {{essentially}} the reverse of conventional landing gear or taildragger. On the ground, tricycle aircraft have a visibility advantage for the pilot as {{the nose of the}} aircraft is level, whereas the high nose of the taildragger can block the view ahead. Tricycle gear aircraft are much less liable to 'nose over' as can happen if a taildragger hits a bump or has the brakes heavily applied. In a <b>nose-over,</b> the aircraft's tail rises and the propeller strikes the ground, causing damage. The tricycle layout reduces the possibility of a ground loop, because the main gear lies behind the center of mass. However, tricycle aircraft can be susceptible to wheel-barrowing. The nosewheel equipped aircraft also is easier to handle on the ground in high winds due to its wing negative angle of attack. Student pilots are able to safely master nosewheel equipped aircraft more quickly.|$|E

50|$|The second YB-49 {{was lost}} on 5 June 1948, killing its pilot, Major Daniel Forbes (for whom Forbes Air Force Base was named), {{co-pilot}} Captain Glen Edwards (for whom Edwards Air Force Base is named), {{and three other}} crew members, one of whom, 1st Lieutenant Edward Lee Swindell, was a crew member on the Boeing B-29 that assisted Chuck Yeager in breaking the sound barrier in the Bell X-1 aircraft. Their aircraft suffered structural failure, with both outer wing sections becoming detached from the center section. Speculation {{at the time was}} that the YB-49 was lost due to excessive pullout loads imposed on the heavy airframe when a scheduled flight test of the large bomber's stall recovery resulted in a sudden and dramatic high-speed, <b>nose-over</b> dive. The post-stall high-speed dive resulted from the clean, low-drag, all-wing design, which gave the YB-49 a rapid speed increase in any type of dive. Fellow YB-49 test pilot Robert Cardenas later claimed that the YB-49 rotated backwards in stall, and that he warned Edwards about it. Jack Northrop later countered that such a behavior was impossible for the all-wing design.|$|E

5000|$|The LEM-3 was {{designed}} by Yuri Vladimirovich Domrachayev & Leonid Sergeyevich Vild'grub as a very high efficiency transport akin to a motor-glider, with high aspect ratio wings and a low-powered engine. The all wood LEM-3 had a conventional tricycle undercarriage, long span wings were supported by a truss running from approx 1/3 span {{to the bottom of}} the u/c legs to the other wing. The initial version had a side-by-side open cockpit, for the two pilots, and an eight-seat cabin with four bench sets under hinged roof access panels with small windows as well as four cargo compartments in the enlarged wing roots. The engine drove a U-2 Propeller, with which the flight tests began in 1936. The factory testing was completed by early [...] when the aircraft was flown to Moscow for testing at the NII GVF(Naoochno-Issledovatel'skiy Institoot Grazdahnskovo Vozdooshnovo Flota - scientific test institute for civil air fleet), unfortunately the aircraft suffered a forced landing on arrival at the NII GVF airfield and further work was abandoned.

40|$|Man-portable {{air defence}} systems (MANPADS) are {{short-range}} surfaceto-air missile systems 1 intended for attacking and defending against low-flying aircraft. Some are crew-served (known sometimes as CREWPADS), {{but most are}} easily handled by a single individual and are shoulder-launched. MANPADS are generally categorized according to their guidance systems: passive infrared (IR) seekers, radio command line-of-sight (CLOS), and laser-beam riders. 2 Initial models of IRseeking missiles could engage a target at altitudes of around 2, 000 – 3, 000 m and from slant ranges 3 of about 4, 000 m (Jane’s, 2006, pp. 3 – 50; 1985, pp. 132 – 37). They were often inaccurate and susceptible to basic countermeasures. Moreover, most could engage aircraft only from behind. Today’s most advanced MANPADS can effectively engage aircraft at ranges of up to 8, 000 m (5 miles) and from multiple directions (Saab, n. d.). Initial development of MANPADS began in the 1950 s. Anti-aircraft guns from the Second World War were of limited use, and consumed vast quantities of ammunition, against increasingly fast jet aircraft. The United States developed the Redeye—which got {{its name from the}} infrared homing device in its <b>nose—over</b> {{the better part of a}} decade, and it entered into production in the mid- 1960 s (Parsch, 2002). The Soviets fielded their own system—the Strela- 2 (also known as the SA- 7, which is used here, or Grail) —in 1968. 4 Both were ‘tail-chase’ systems effective only when fired at the target from behind. By the end of the 1960 s only these two countries produced MANPADS, although Sweden and the United Kingdom had undertaken research and development of indigenous weapons. The 1970 s saw a significant expansion of the industry. The United States began development of the Stinger missile system in 1972 (Parsch, 2002) and production began in 1979 (Jane’s, 2006, p. 43). Work on the Soviet Strela- 3 (SA- 14 Gremlin) began in 1968, and it entered service six years later in 1974 (Jane’s, 2006, p. 30). Like their predecessors, these systems were IR-seeking missiles, but they were able to engage targets from multiple directions (not just from behind). Second-generation IR seekers also achieved a greater effective range and accuracy. The British Blowpipe system was based on radio CLOS technology, while the Swedish RBS- 70 uses a laser beam-ridin...|$|E
