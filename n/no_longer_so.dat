5|$|Travelling {{further along}} Durham Road towards Gateshead are two more Grade II listed {{buildings}}. The first is Heathfield House, a two story villa built by John Wardle (designer of St Helen's Church) in 1865 and Musgrave House, an ashlar villa with raised quoins built in 18545 {{which has been}} used as a school but is <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>so.</b> Both buildings are now converted to private flats.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon, who {{had been}} well {{respected}} in Egypt and had earned himself the nickname Sultan el-Kebir (the Great Sultan) among the people of Cairo, lost their admiration and was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> addressed. In March 1800, French General Jean Baptiste Kléber was assassinated by Suleiman al-Halabi, a student at al-Azhar. Following the assassination, Napoleon ordered {{the closing of the}} mosque; the doors remained bolted until Ottoman and British assistance arrived in August 1801.|$|E
5|$|A {{good picture}} of the county in 1086 is given by Domesday Book, though there is some {{difficulty}} in identifying the various places since the hundreds are not specified. The total population given for the county, which had different boundaries to those today, was 13,399, however this only included the heads of households, so with their families {{this may have been}} around 67,000. Farming seems to have prospered for the next three centuries but was severely hit by the Black Death which in 1348 arrived in Dorset and quickly spread through Somerset, causing widespread mortality, perhaps as much as 50% in places. It re-occurred, resulting in a change in feudal practices since the manpower was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> available.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September 1899, Gan {{died at the}} age of 55 in {{his house}} at No. 87 Amoy Street. His total assets were worth an {{estimated}} S$550,000. He was buried at Leng Kee Sua somewhere on the hill by the side where Leng Kee Road runs today. Due to redevelopment of the area, his body was disinterred and reburied in a family grave at Bukit Brown Cemetery. After the death of his father, Gan Tiang Tok continued the family business for three years, though by the turn of century it was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> lucrative. Gan Tiang Tok was dogged by ill health from 1903 until his death in 1927 at the age of 68.|$|E

5|$|With Marais's loans {{combined}} with the Ebden scholarship, Smuts began to enjoy a degree of financial security. Though far from affluent {{he was at least}} able to meet his basic expenses. From his second year onwards Smuts began to enter more into the social arena of the university. He ceased to be lonely, making a number of friends and acquaintances, principally amongst the other colonial students. Though <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> reclusive as he had been during his first year, he remained extremely serious and devoted to his work; an attitude which served as a barrier separating him from the English undergraduates, though not from the Fellows at Cambridge, with many of whom he struck up friendships.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} the {{boundaries}} of 1914, Germany in 1700 had a population of 16 million, increasing slightly to 17 million by 1750, and growing more rapidly to 24 million by 1800. Wars continued, but they were <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> devastating to the civilian population; famines and major epidemics did not occur, but increased agricultural productivity led to a higher birth rate, and a lower death rate.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, modernismo emerged, a poetic {{movement}} whose founding text was Nicaraguan poet Rubén Darío's Azul (1888). This was the first Latin American literary movement to influence literary culture outside of the region, and was also the first truly Latin American literature, in that national differences were <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> much at issue. José Martí, for instance, though a Cuban patriot, also lived in Mexico and the United States and wrote for journals in Argentina and elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|The {{placement}} of stress {{did not change}} from Classical to Vulgar Latin, and words continued to be stressed on the same syllable they were before. However, the loss of distinctive length disrupted the correlation between syllable weight and stress placement that existed in Classical Latin. Where in Classical Latin {{the place of the}} accent was predictable from the structure of the word, it was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> in Vulgar Latin. Stress had become a phonological property and could serve to distinguish forms that were otherwise homophones.|$|E
5000|$|Monotonic orthography for Modern Greek {{uses only}} two diacritics, the tonos and diaeresis (sometimes used in combination) that have {{significance}} in pronunciation. Initial [...] is <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> pronounced, and <b>so</b> the rough and smooth breathings are <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> necessary. The unique pitch {{patterns of the}} three accents have disappeared, and only a stress accent remains. The iota subscript was a diacritic invented to mark an etymological vowel that was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> pronounced, <b>so</b> it was dispensed with as well.|$|R

25|$|Adams {{was serving}} a life {{sentence}} that had been commuted from a death sentence on a legal technicality for the 1976 murder of Robert Wood, a Dallas police officer. Adams told Morris that he had been framed, and that David Harris, who was present {{at the time of the}} murder and was the principal witness for the prosecution, had in fact killed Wood. Morris began researching the case because it related to Dr. Grigson. He was at first unconvinced of Adams's innocence. After reading the transcripts of the trial and meeting David Harris at a bar, however, Morris was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> sure.|$|E
25|$|As modems reached {{speeds of}} 28.8kbit/s, the {{overhead}} of the TCP/IP protocols were <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> egregious and dial-up Internet became increasingly common. By 1995 {{the bulletin board}} market was reeling as users abandoned local BBS systems in favour of larger sites and web pages, which could be accessed worldwide for the same cost as accessing a local BBS system. This also made FidoNet less expensive to implement, because inter-net transfers could be delivered over the Internet as well, at little or no marginal cost. But this seriously diluted the entire purpose of the store-and-forward model, which had been built up specifically to address a long-distance problem that no longer existed.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many {{operating}} systems that were significant in their day but are <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>so,</b> such as AmigaOS; OS/2 from IBM and Microsoft; classic Mac OS, the non-Unix precursor to Apple's macOS; BeOS; XTS-300; RISC OS; MorphOS; Haiku; BareMetal and FreeMint. Some are still used in niche markets {{and continue to be}} developed as minority platforms for enthusiast communities and specialist applications. OpenVMS, formerly from DEC, is still under active development by Hewlett-Packard. Yet other operating systems are used almost exclusively in academia, for operating systems education or to do research on operating system concepts. A typical example of a system that fulfills both roles is MINIX, while for example Singularity is used purely for research.|$|E

25|$|Foch {{was pleased}} at Wilson’s appointment, {{although}} Haig {{noted in his}} diary (25 February) that Wilson was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> keen on a strong staff under Rawlinson, his successor at Versailles. Rawlinson for his part supported Haig’s unwillingness to release any divisions to the General Reserve. Petain only agreed to release 8 French divisions and made a bilateral agreement with Haig to assist one another. Wilson protested to Lloyd George, who commented that Haig’s attitude was “very stupid & short sighted but agreed we could not force Haig at this moment“. Wilson defended Haig’s position to the War Cabinet (6 March) and blamed Clemenceau and Petain (both of whom disliked Foch) and wrote in his diary that the British government {{had little choice but}} to back Haig “wrong as I believe him to be”. At a SWC Meeting in London (14–15 March) Foch agreed under protest to shelve the Allied Reserve.|$|E
500|$|J.B. Aspinall's novel Sycorax (2006) {{places the}} origin of the story with a 14th-century peasant woman from Yorkshire. The Indian poet Suniti Namjoshi in Sycorax: New Fables and Poems imagines Sycorax {{returning}} to the island after Prospero and the others have left (including Caliban). Namjoshi has stated, [...] "The Sycorax in my poem is still alive [...] [...] [...] She is still defiant, still fierce, but she is old and knows that death is <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> far away that it need not be thought of... I wanted to follow Sycorax, keep her company, as it were, up to the final moment".|$|E
500|$|According to critic Vladimir Stasov, Glazunov and Tchaikovsky {{first met}} in October 1884 at a {{gathering}} hosted by Balakirev. Glazunov was then 19 years old. Tchaikovsky was in Saint Petersburg because his opera Eugene Onegin was being {{performed at the}} Mariinsky Theater. Glazunov later wrote that while the nationalists' circle [...] "was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> ideologically closed and isolated {{as it had been}} earlier", they [...] "did not consider P.I. Tchaikovsky one of our own. We valued only a few of his works, like Romeo and Juliet, The Tempest, Francesca [...] and the finale of the Second Symphony. The rest of his output was either unknown or alien to us". Tchaikovsky's presence won over Glazunov and the other young members present, and his conversation with them [...] "was a fresh breeze amid our somewhat dusty atmosphere... Many of the young musicians present, including Lyadov and myself, left Balakirev's apartment charmed by Tchaikovsky's personality.... As Lyadov put it, our acquaintance with the great composer was a real occasion." ...|$|E
