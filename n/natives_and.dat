However, disfluencies (such as pauses, fillers, repairs, etc.) occur in both <b>native</b> <b>and</b> non-native speech and it is as yet unclear ow luency raters weigh the fluency characteristics of <b>native</b> <b>and</b> non-native speech. Two rating experiments compared the way raters assess the luency of <b>native</b> <b>and</b> non-native speech. The fluency characteristics of <b>native</b> <b>and</b> non- <b>native</b> speech were controlled by using phonetic anipulations in pause (Experiment 1) and speed characteristics (Experiment 2).

Clashes, sometimes deadly, occurred between the <b>natives</b> <b>and</b> the trappers and later between the <b>natives</b> <b>and</b> European-American miners and settlers. These struggles culminated with the Rogue River Wars of 1855–56 and removal of most of the natives to reservations outside the basin. After the war, settlers expanded into remote areas of the watershed and established small farms along the river between Grave Creek and the mouth of the Illinois River. They were relatively isolated from the outside world until 1895, when the Post Office Department added mail-boat service along the lower Rogue. As of 2010, the Rogue has one of the two remaining rural mail-boat routes in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Recently, ecologists {{debated whether}} {{distinguishing}} native from non-native species is sensible or not.

We studied the functional traits that drive <b>native</b> <b>and</b> non-native vascular plant species frequency in Germany by explaining species grid-cell frequency using traits and their interaction with status. <b>Native</b> <b>and</b> non-native species frequency was equally driven by life span, ploidy type and self-compatibility.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of BiologyKeith B. GidoMany native {{freshwater}} {{animals are}} imperiled {{as a result}} of habitat alteration, species introductions and climate-moderated changes in disturbance regimes. <b>Native</b> conservation <b>and</b> nonnative species management could benefit from greater understanding of critical factors promoting or inhibiting <b>native</b> <b>and</b> nonnative success in the absence of human-caused ecosystem change. The objectives of this dissertation were to (1) explain spatiotemporal patterns of <b>native</b> <b>and</b> nonnative success, (2) describe <b>native</b> <b>and</b> nonnative response to uncharacteristic wildfire disturbance, and (3) test the hypothesis that wildfire disturbance has differential effects on <b>native</b> <b>and</b> nonnative species. This research was conducted across six sites in three reaches (tributary, canyon, and valley) of the unfragmented and largely-unmodified upper Gila River Basin of southwestern New Mexico. Secondary production was measured to quantify success of <b>native</b> <b>and</b> nonnative fishes prior to wildfires during 2008 - 2011. Native fish production was greater than nonnatives across a range of environmental conditions, although nonnative fish, tadpole, and crayfish production could approach or exceed that of <b>native</b> macroinvertebrates <b>and</b> fishes in canyon habitats, a warmwater tributary, or in valley sites, respectively. The second objective was accomplished by measuring biomass changes of a warmwater <b>native</b> <b>and</b> nonnative community during 2010 - 2013 before and after consecutive, uncharacteristic wildfires. Several <b>native</b> insect <b>and</b> fish taxa decreased after both wildfires, whereas nonnative decreases were most pronounced for salmonids and more limited for other taxa. Finally, effects of uncharacteristic wildfires followed by extreme flooding on metapopulations of <b>native</b> <b>and</b> nonnative fishes were contrasted during 2008 - 2013. Wildfire and flood disturbances increased extinction probabilities of all native fishes while leaving many nonnative fishes unaffected. These findings revealed a swinging pendulum of <b>native</b> <b>and</b> nonnative success, wherein wildfire disturbance resulted in a pendulum swing in favor of nonnatives. Ensuring the pendulum swings back in favor of natives will be facilitated by management activities that decrease wildfire size and intensity and maintain inherent ecosystem resilience...|$|R
30|$|In summary, both <b>native</b> <b>and</b> {{non-native}} speakers perceptually differentiated {{the presence}} and absence of phonemes (i.e., acoustic signals) behind noise. In addition, both <b>native</b> <b>and</b> non-native speakers restored missing nasals more than missing liquids. The difference between <b>native</b> <b>and</b> non-native speakers lay in the lexical support {{for the restoration of}} missing phonemes. In addition, the size of perception of present phonemes as well as the size of restoration of missing phonemes were bigger among native speakers than non-native speakers. These results can be understood that bottom-up acoustic processing takes place, relatively, similarly among <b>native</b> <b>and</b> non-native speakers while top-down lexical processing operates differently. Earlier studies suggested that Japanese native speakers tend to have difficulties in the discrimination of English /l/ and /r/ (bottom-up processing) as compared to English native speakers, {{because of the fact that}} Japanese language does not have /l/ and /r/ in the phonemic inventory (Goto 1971; MacKain et al. 1981; Miyawaki et al. 1975). This seems to suggest that the phonemes within the same phonemic category are easily differentiated by native speakers but not easily by non-native speakers. At the same time, the current study suggested that the phonemes in a particular phonemic category (e.g. liquids), as compared to phonemes in another phonemic category (e.g., nasals), was similarly processed among <b>native</b> <b>and</b> non-native speakers; nasal consonants were generally restored more than liquids by both <b>native</b> <b>and</b> non-native speakers. It can be understood that bottom-up processing within a particular phonemic category works differently among <b>native</b> <b>and</b> non-native speakers, but bottom-up processing between particular phonemic categories work similarly among <b>native</b> <b>and</b> non-native speakers, based on the acoustic characteristics of speech sounds.|$|R

The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, a coalition of various tribes, adopted a constitution and incorporated after the 1938 completion of the Bonneville Dam flooded Cascades Rapids; Still, in the 1930s, there were natives who lived along the river and fished year round, moving along with the fish's migration patterns throughout the seasons. The Yakama were slower to do so, organizing a formal government in 1944. In the 21stcentury, the Yakama, Nez Perce, Umatilla, and Warm Springs tribes all have treaty fishing rights along the Columbia and its tributaries.|$|E

30|$|As a whole, both <b>native</b> <b>and</b> {{non-native}} speakers {{perceived the}} difference between the ‘added’ (phoneme + noise) and ‘replaced’ sound (noise only). In addition, both <b>native</b> <b>and</b> non-native speakers perceived the present and absent nasals significantly more than liquids. The only difference between <b>native</b> <b>and</b> non-native speakers was the lexical support for perception; while native speakers perceived the present and absent phoneme in words better than non-words, non-native speakers perceived the present and absent phoneme in words and non-words equivalently (a significant three-way interaction among noise, phonemes, and lexicality, and a significant four-way interaction among noise, phonemes, lexicality, and language factors). Phonemic restoration seems to take place differently with the different ratio of bottom-up acoustic processing and top-down lexical processing among <b>native</b> <b>and</b> non-native speakers.|$|R

First, backchannels in two situations were analyzed using four viewpoints, 1) frequency, 2) function, 3) appearing position, 4) message composition. As a result, difference was seen. Second, contrast of backchannel usage between <b>native</b> <b>and</b> non-native was examined. Native show discourse management transmitting backchannels and substantial remarks together for a certain turn-taking, avoiding complicated conversation. Meanwhile, non-native use more backchannels than native to distinct speaker and listener clearly. Third, as for the common characteristics of <b>native</b> <b>and</b> non-native backchannel usage, both show participants' consideration and avoid inconsistent message by time lag in the point of turn-taking. Moreover, using many backchannels of "content understanding" and "feeling expre ssion", participants incline to indicate strong understanding and positive reaction. In conclusion, <b>native</b> <b>and</b> non-native in chat conversation present various types of discourse management in contact situations.
