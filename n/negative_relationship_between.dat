25|$|A {{more recent}} study {{suggests}} that EI {{is not necessarily a}} universally positive trait. They found a negative correlation between EI and managerial work demands; while under low levels of managerial work demands, they found a <b>negative</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> EI and teamwork effectiveness. An explanation for this may suggest gender differences in EI, as women tend to score higher levels than men. This furthers the idea that job context plays a role in the relationships between EI, teamwork effectiveness, and job performance. Another interesting find was discussed in a study that assessed a possible link between EI and entrepreneurial behaviors and success.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the magnitude, direction, and statistical significance of the <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> active travel and rates of physical activity, obesity, and diabetes. METHODS: We examined aggregate cross-sectional health and travel data for 14 countries, all 50 US states, and 47 of the 50 largest US cities through graphical, correlation, and bivariate regression analysis on the country, state, and city levels. RESULTS: At all 3 geographic levels, we found statistically significant <b>negative</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> active travel and self-reported obesity. At the state and city levels, we found statistically significant positive <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> active travel and physical activity and statistically significant <b>negative</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> active travel and diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Together with many other studies, our analysis provides evidence of the population-level health benefits of active travel.

Approximately half of the free-living insects are habitat-specific, while the remainder are generalists found {{in a variety of}} habitats, being associated with either supralittoral or intertidal zones, Poa cookii and Pringlea antiscorbutica stands, bryophytes, lichen-covered rocks, exposed rock faces or the underside of rocks. There is a pronounced seasonality to the insect fauna, with densities in winter months dropping to a small percentage (between 0.75%) of the summer maximum. Distinct differences in relative abundances of species between habitats has also been shown, including a <b>negative</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> altitude and body size for Heard Island weevils.|$|E
25|$|Debt {{levels may}} affect {{economic}} growth rates. In 2010, economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart reported {{that among the}} 20 developed countries studied, average annual GDP growth was 3–4% when debt was relatively moderate or low (i.e. under 60% of GDP), but it dips to just 1.6% when debt was high (i.e., above 90% of GDP). In April 2013, the conclusions of Rogoff and Reinhart's study came into question when a coding error in their original paper was discovered by Herndon, Ash and Pollin of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Herndon, Ash and Pollin found that after correcting for errors and unorthodox methods used, {{there was no evidence}} that debt above a specific threshold reduces growth. Reinhart and Rogoff maintain that after correcting for errors, a <b>negative</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> high debt and growth remains. However, other economists, including Paul Krugman, have argued that it is low growth which causes national debt to increase, rather than the other way around.|$|E
500|$|Proponents {{state the}} FairTax {{would reduce the}} number of tax filers by about 86% (from 100 million to 14 million) and reduce the filing {{complexity}} to a simplified state sales tax form. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), among others, have specifically identified the <b>negative</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> compliance costs and the number of focal points for collection. Under the FairTax, the federal government would be able to concentrate tax enforcement efforts on a single tax. Retailers would receive an administrative fee equal to the greater of $200 or 0.25% of the remitted tax as compensation for compliance costs. In addition, supporters state that the overwhelming majority of purchases occur in major retail outlets, which are very unlikely to evade the FairTax and risk losing their business licenses. Economic Census figures for 2002 show that 48.5% of merchandise sales are made by just 688 businesses ("Big-Box" [...] retailers). 85.7% of all retail sales are made by 92,334 businesses, which is 3.6% of American companies. In the service sector, approximately 80% of sales are made by 1.2% of U.S. businesses.|$|E

The HDI is a composite of life expectancy, income, and level of education. Development promotes fertility decline at HDI levels below 0.9 but further advances in HDI cause a small rebound in birth rate. In many countries with very high levels of development, fertility rates are now approaching two children per woman — although there are exceptions, notably Germany, Italy and Japan.|$|E

Consistently, <b>negative</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> latitude, and positive <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> sea surface temperature (SST), and relative richness and relative abundance of herbivorous fishes were found worldwide.

40|$|Although {{secondary}} salinisation of streams {{has long}} been recognised as {{a major threat to}} biodiversity in Australia, there is little empirical evidence of the impacts of salinisation on riparian flora and fauna. We studied the effects of soil salinity on riparian plants and plant-dwelling invertebrates in two adjacent catchments of the Collie River in the south west of Western Australia. We found significant <b>negative</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> soil salinity and the diversity of riparian plants, both within and between catchments. Increasing salinity was also associated with a change in plant species composition, which appeared to be due to a greater impact of salinity on some riparian plant species than on others. In controlled laboratory experiments, increasing salinity significantly decreased germination rates in Bossiaea eriocarpa, Hypocalymma angustifolium, Hakea lissocarpha, Hakea undulata and Hakea varia, all of which were relatively more common in the field at low soil salinities, while there was no effect of salinity on germination rates in Melaleuca viminea, Xanthorrhoea preissii and Corymbia calophylla, which were all relatively more common at high soil salinities.
