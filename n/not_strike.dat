5|$|The new cent {{was issued}} in {{exchange}} for the worn Spanish colonial silver coin that had circulated in the U.S. until then, as well as for its larger predecessor. So many cents were issued that they choked commercial channels, especially as they were not legal tender and no one had to take them. The eagle design did <b>not</b> <b>strike</b> well, and was replaced in 1859 by Longacre's Indian Head cent.|$|E
5|$|The {{temperature}} of {{a lightning bolt}} can be five times hotter than {{the surface of the}} sun. Although the lightning is extremely hot, the duration is short and 90% of strike victims survive. Contrary to the popular idea that lightning does <b>not</b> <b>strike</b> twice in the same spot, some people have been struck by lightning over three times, and skyscrapers like the Empire State Building have been struck numerous times in the same storm.|$|E

5|$|Before Chataan {{affected}} Guam, officials canceled U.S. Independence Day festivities, {{and residents}} purchased storm supplies. Although {{the center of}} the eye did <b>not</b> <b>strike</b> Guam, the eyewall affected the entire island with strong winds and heavy rainfall. The highest sustained winds were estimated at 120km/h (75mph), with gusts to 167km/h (104mph) at Andersen Air Force Base. Gusts were slightly higher at Apra Harbor, peaking at 170km/h (106mph), and gusts may have reached as high as 200km/h (125mph). Similar to its effects on Chuuk, Chataan dropped heavy rainfall on Guam, peaking at 536mm (21.1in) on Mount Almagosa; the same station reported 311mm (12.2in) in about three hours. The Weather Forecast Office on the island reported 265mm (10.4in) in a 24-hour period. The rains were less than 250mm (10in) in northern Guam, and were highest in the mountainous southern region where the eye crossed. While moving across the island, Chataan produced a significant storm surge that peaked at about 3.6m (12ft) in Umatac.|$|E
5|$|Hunters {{primarily}} {{attack the}} player by bracing themselves and firing bursts from their flechette cannon. Four flechettes can vaporize an ordinary human soldier. If they do <b>not</b> <b>strike</b> a living target, the flechette charge up {{for several seconds}} and then explode, dealing minor damage to everything nearby. Hunters may also conduct a charging attack or strike with their legs if the player gets too close. Hunters are vulnerable to all weapons, but to compensate, are still quite resilient, making explosives and the pulse rifle's charged energy ball the most attractive options. Objects thrown with the gravity gun are also effective, especially if the player catches some of their flechettes with the object before hurling it (one of the in-game Achievements). In outdoor environments, they can be run over with a vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The assault did <b>not</b> <b>strike</b> the {{southern}} part of the line held by Lieutenant Colonel John T. Corley's 3rd Battalion, 24th Infantry, and Throckmorton's 5th Infantry. That part of the line, however, did receive artillery and mortar fire and some diversionary light attacks. At about 02:00 on September 1, men in an outpost on the right flank of Corley's battalion watched an estimated 600 North Korean soldiers file past at a distance of , going in the direction of Haman. Viewed during the night from the high ground of the 3rd Battalion, Haman seemed to be in flames. At dawn, men in the battalion saw an estimated 800 North Korean troops enter the town.|$|E

5|$|Upon closer approach, the German vessels {{realised}} {{the nearby}} vessels were British and scattered, while Undaunted—which {{was closer to}} the Germans than the destroyers—opened fire on the nearest torpedo boat. This German vessel managed to dodge the fire from Undaunted by changing course but lost speed and the British force caught up. To protect Undaunted from torpedo attack and to destroy the Germans as quickly as possible, Fox ordered the squadron to divide. Lance and Lennox chased S115 and S119 as Legion and Loyal pursued S117 and S118. Fire from Legion, Loyal and Undaunted damaged S118 so badly that its bridge was blown off the deck, sinking her at 15:17. Lance and Lennox engaged S115, disabling her steering gear and causing the German vessel to circle. Lennoxs fire was so effective that the bridge of S115 was also destroyed but the German torpedo-boat did <b>not</b> <b>strike</b> her colours.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, in {{reaction}} to a plan of the policemen of the Boston Police Department to register with a union, Police Commissioner Edwin U. Curtis announced that such an act would not be tolerated. In August of that year, the American Federation of Labor issued a charter to the Boston Police Union. Curtis declared the union's leaders were guilty of insubordination and would be relieved of duty, but indicated he would cancel their suspension if the union was dissolved by September 4. The mayor of Boston, Andrew Peters, convinced Curtis to delay his action for a few days, but with no results, and Curtis suspended the union leaders on September 8. The following day, about three-quarters of the policemen in Boston went on strike. Coolidge, tacitly but fully in support of Curtis' position, closely monitored the situation but initially deferred to the local authorities. He anticipated that only a resulting measure of lawlessness could sufficiently prompt the public to understand and appreciate the controlling principle – that a policeman does <b>not</b> <b>strike.</b> That night and the next, there was sporadic violence and rioting in the unruly city. Peters, concerned about sympathy strikes by the firemen and others, called up some units of the Massachusetts National Guard stationed in the Boston area pursuant to an old and obscure legal authority, and relieved Curtis of duty.|$|E
5|$|Passing over Okinawa with {{a central}} {{pressure}} of 910mbar (hPa; 26.87inHg), Bolaven {{became one of the}} most intense typhoons to ever strike the region. Off the coast of Wakayama Prefecture, swells from the typhoon battered fishing vessels and knocked the captain of one ship overboard. Although a rescue helicopter was quick to reach him, he was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. Just off the coast of Jogashima Misaki-cho in Miura, Kanagawa, two boys were swept away by large swells. A mother attempted to swim after them to save them but later drowned. The two boys were later rescued with minor injuries by the Coast Guard. Although the storm did <b>not</b> <b>strike</b> the Japanese mainland, its outer bands brought showers and thunderstorms to parts of Kyushu. Due to the rains, rail service in Saga Prefecture was temporarily suspended, affecting 4,200 passengers. In Isahaya, one person was injured after being struck by a billboard downed by high winds. Throughout Japan, losses to agriculture and fisheries amounted to ¥423.28million (US$5.39million).|$|E
