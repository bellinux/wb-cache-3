40|$|OBJECTIVES. This study {{compared}} the relative {{strength of the}} associations {{of a set of}} structural (social, economic, and political) variables and a set of health services variables with state-level infant, <b>neonatal,</b> and postneonatal <b>mortality.</b> It also examined whether health services mediate the relationships between structural variables and state-level infant, <b>neonatal,</b> and postneonatal <b>mortality.</b> METHODS. With the state as the unit of analysis, data for all 50 states were analyzed by means of multiple regression. RESULTS. Structural variables accounted for substantially more variance in infant, <b>neonatal,</b> and postneonatal <b>mortality</b> than health services variables, and health services variables were more strongly related to infant <b>mortality</b> than to <b>neonatal</b> or postneonatal <b>mortality.</b> When health services variables were controlled, the strengths of the associations between the structural variables and infant, <b>neonatal,</b> and postneonatal <b>mortality</b> were reduced but remained statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS. A substantial portion of the variance in state-level infant mortality is accounted for by states' structural characteristics, which are partially mediated by health services...|$|R

25|$|Often {{performed}} by traditional practitioners using unsterile techniques and devices, FGM can have both immediate and late complications. These include excessive bleeding, urinary tract infections, wound infection, {{and in the}} case of unsterile and reused instruments, hepatitis and HIV. In the long run, scars and keloids can form, which can obstruct and damage the urinary and genital tracts. According to a 2005 UNICEF report on FGM, it is unknown how many girls and women die from the procedure because of poor record keeping and a failure to report fatalities. FGM may also complicate pregnancy and place women at a higher risk for obstetrical problems, such as prolonged labor.

40|$|This paper uses a panel {{data set}} {{comprising}} 23 cities {{for the years}} 1979 - 2002 in Taiwan and a fixed-effects model to find evidence {{of the effect of}} economic instability on infant, <b>neonatal,</b> and postneonatal <b>mortality</b> rates.

The most important finding is that infant, <b>neonatal,</b> and postneonatal <b>mortality</b> rates move counter-cyclically with the city unemployment rate in Taiwan. The provision of national health insurance is also found to {{have a positive impact on}} the health of infants in Taiwan. Finally, the impact of economic instability on the infant, <b>neonatal,</b> and postneonatal <b>mortality</b> rates is found to be the strongest in the eastern part of Taiwan, which is the region with the fewest health care resources.

2500|$|Experts {{attribute}} high {{mortality rates}} and under nutrition amongst infants to the decreasing number {{of woman who}} breastfeed. This delay in breastfeeding initiation increases the risk of <b>neonatal</b> <b>mortality.</b> Experts suggest breastfeeding within the first day of birth until the infant is 6-months old. [...] Promotion of breastfeeding during this period could potentially reduce the mortality rates by 16% if infant was breast fed since day one and 22% if the infant was breastfed within the first hour. Rates of breastfeeding initiation vary with ethnicity and socioeconomic situations. Studies suggest that college educated women over their 30 are more likely to initiate breastfeeding in comparison to other women who have different levels of educational attainment.|$|E

40|$|The model {{presented}} in this paper emphasizes the importance of the mother's nutritional intake as a determinant of infant health. Using cross-sectional market averages for 1980 and 1981 in Japan, we find that the nutrient intake of the mother during pregnancy is a potential determinant of <b>neonatal</b> and infant <b>mortality</b> in Japan, with increased consumption of calcium and iron leading to improved birth outcomes. Using the results obtained from the estimation of <b>neonatal</b> and infant <b>mortality</b> production functions, we note that increases in the prices of food items, in particular milk and meat, would lead to increases in <b>neonatal</b> and infant <b>mortality</b> rates. We discover that the availability of abortion in Japan, unlike in the U. S., is positively related to mortality rates, although never significantly. Finally, we see that cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and poor environmental quality all have strongly adverse effects on newborn survival outcomes in Japan. ...|$|R

Retrospective assessment of clinical, technical, and human factors in 15 Nigerian neonatal centres was carried out to investigate how the application of RIT impacted these factors. Pre-RIT and post-RIT <b>neonatal</b> <b>mortalities</b> were compared by studying case files. Effect on neonatal nursing was studied through questionnaires that were completed by 79 nurses from 9 centres across the country. Technical performance was assessed based on 10 -indices scores from clinicians and nurses. The results showed an increase in neonatal survival, nursing enthusiasm, and practice confidence.

However, the maternal age with the lowest reproductive risk has not been established. Aim: To determine the range of maternal age with the lowest reproductive risk. Material and Methods: A population-based study (2005 - 2010) was performed analyzing raw data from vital statistics yearbooks of the National Institute of Statistics of Chile. The association of maternal, fetal, <b>neonatal</b> and infant <b>mortality</b> with maternal age was analyzed. The latter was stratified in quinquenniums, between ages 10 and 54 years. Maternal, fetal, <b>neonatal</b> and infant <b>mortality</b> rates were calculated for each quinquennium.

Results: Women of 20 - 29, 25 - 34 and under 30 years, had the lowest rate of fetal, neonatal/infant and maternal death, respectively.
