25|$|The Board, {{which had}} been aware for some time of the government's {{intention}} for organisations such as itself to operate in a more commercial manner, had been making changes with this in mind. The Christchurch City Council had investigated the idea of transforming the Board into a limited liability company in the late 1980s, fully held by the Council, but found that the legislation on which the Board was founded had no provision to allow this. An Establishment Unit was created in March 1988, {{under the auspices of}} the Local Government Act 1974, to manage the transition of the Board to a commercial entity. The Unit was replaced in October with a Transitional Committee that had wider representation from local authorities to decide the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> that the Board would become.|$|E

The report criticised Thorpe's failure to investigate the true <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> before involving himself, [...] "a cautionary tale for any leading politician". Thorpe received some relief when his former colleague Bessell, who had resigned from parliament and relocated to California to escape from a string of business failures, re-emerged in early February after discovery by the Daily Mail. Bessell gave muddled accounts of his involvement with Scott, but insisted that his former chief was innocent of any wrongdoing.|$|E
500|$|According to Playdead co-founder Dino Patti {{and lead}} {{designer}} Jeppe Carlsen, Playdead's game director, Arnt Jensen, conceived Limbo around 2004. At that time, {{as a concept}} artist at IO Interactive, Jensen became dissatisfied with the increasingly corporate <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company.</b> He had sketched a [...] "mood image" [...] of a [...] "secret place" [...] to get ideas, and the result, similar to the backgrounds of the final game, inspired Jensen to expand on it. Jensen initially tried on his own to program the game in Visual Basic around 2004, but found he needed more help and proceeded to create an art style trailer by 2006. He had only intended to use the trailer {{as a means to}} recruit a programmer to help him, but the video attracted substantial interest in the project from across the Internet, eventually leading him to meet with Patti, who was also dissatisfied with his job. Their collaboration led to the founding of Playdead. Although Patti helped in the first few months with programming, he realised that the project was much larger than the two of them could handle, and Patti developed the business around the game's expanded development.|$|E

2500|$|McReynolds {{rejected}} the government's proposed [...] "interference" [...] test as unworkable. The majority's test he also rejected, arguing that no tax, {{no matter how}} onerous, could ever truly burden the vast resources of the federal government.

50|$|Even as the {{settlement}} began to grow, <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company’s</b> business was changing.

6000|$|This indeed {{had been}} quite the thing I was asking myself all the wondrous way down from Rome, and was to ask myself afresh, on the return, largely {{within sight of the}} sea, as our earlier course had kept to the ineffably romantic inland valleys, the great {{decorated}} blue vistas in which the breasts of the mountains shine vaguely with strange high-lying city and castle and church and convent, even as shoulders of no diviner line might be hung about with dim old jewels. It was odd, at the end of time, long after those initiations, of comparative youth, that had then struck one as extending the very field itself of felt charm, as exhausting the possibilities of fond surrender, it was odd to have positively a new basis of enjoyment, a new gate of triumphant passage, thrust into one's consciousness and opening to one's use; just as I confess I have to brace myself a little to call by such fine names our latest, our ugliest and most monstrous aid to motion. It is true of the monster, as we have known him up to now, that one can neither quite praise him nor quite blame him without a blush--he reflects so the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> he's condemned to keep. His splendid easy power addressed to noble aims makes him assuredly on occasion a purely beneficent creature. I parenthesise at any rate that I know him in no other light--counting out of course the acquaintance that consists of a dismayed arrest in the road, with back flattened against wall or hedge, for the dusty, smoky, stenchy shock of his passage. To no end is his easy power more blest than to that of ministering to the ramifications, as it were, of curiosity, or to that, in other words, of achieving for us, among the kingdoms of the earth, the grander and more genial, the comprehensive and complete introduction. Much as was ever to be said for our old forms of pilgrimage--and I am convinced that they are far from wholly superseded--they left, they had to leave, dreadful gaps in our yearning, dreadful lapses in our knowledge, dreadful failures in our energy; there were always things off and beyond, goals of delight and dreams of desire, that dropped {{as a matter of course}} into the unattainable, and over to which our wonder- working agent now flings the firm straight bridge. Curiosity has lost, under this amazing extension, its salutary renouncements perhaps; contemplation has become one with action and satisfaction one with desire--speaking always in the spirit of the inordinate lover of an enlightened use of our eyes. That may represent, for all I know, an insolence of advantage on which there will be eventual heavy charges, as yet obscure and incalculable, to pay, and I glance at the possibility only to avoid all thought of the lesson of the long run, and to insist that I utter this dithyramb but in the immediate flush and fever of the short. For such a beat of time as our fine courteous and contemplative advance upon Naples, and for such another as our retreat northward under the same fine law of observation and homage, the bribed consciousness could only decline to question its security. The sword of Damocles suspended over that presumption, the skeleton at the banquet of extravagant ease, would have been that even at our actual inordinate rate--leaving quite apart [...] "improvements" [...] to come--such savings of trouble begin to use up the world; some hard grain of difficulty being always a necessary part of the composition of pleasure. The hard grain in our old comparatively pedestrian mixture, before this business of our learning not so much even to fly (which might indeed involve trouble) as to be mechanically and prodigiously flown, quite another matter, was the element of uncertainty, effort and patience; the handful of silver nails which, I admit, drove many an impression home. The seated motorist misses the silver nails, I fully acknowledge, save in so far as his aesthetic (let alone his moral) conscience may supply him with some artful subjective substitute; in which case the thing becomes a precious secret of his own.|$|E
