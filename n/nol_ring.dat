40|$|International audienceTo {{assess the}} {{durability}} of drinking water connection pipes subjected to oxidation and slow crack growth, a comprehensive database was constructed on a novel specimen geometry: the pre-cracked <b>NOL</b> <b>ring.</b> 135 tests were carried out consisting of initial crack depth ratio ranging from 0. 08 to 0. 6; single or double longitudinal cracks: tensile with steady strain rate and creep loading. A threshold value of the crack depth ratio of 0. 2, induced by the oxidation was determined by analyzing several mechanical parameters. This threshold value was shown to be independent on the strain rate effects, single or double crack configuration {{and the kind of}} loading: tensile or creep. Creep test results with crack depth ratio larger than 0. 2 were then utilized to establish a failure assessment diagram. A methodology allowing the prediction of residual lifetime of in-service pipes was proposed, using this diagram...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of polyimide resin as a matrix for glass filament-wound thin metal-lined pressure vessels was studied over a temperature range of (minus) 320 to 600 F. Keramid 601 polyimide {{was found to}} perform quite well over {{the entire range of}} temperature. Hoop stress values of 425 ksi were determined at 75 F which is equivalent to epoxy resin in similar structures. At - 320 and 600 F, 125 and 80 % of this strength was retained. Thermal ageing at 500 F for up to 50 hours was studied with severe reduction in strength, but there is evidence that this reduction could be improved. Another polyimide resin studied was P 10 PA which was found to have processing characteristics inappropriate for filament-winding. <b>NOL</b> <b>ring</b> tensile and shear data was determined from both resins with S-glass. Pressure vessel design, fabrication and test procedures are described in detail...|$|E
40|$|HDPE pipes {{are used}} for the {{transport}} of drinking water. However, disinfectants in water {{seem to have a}} strong impact on their mechanical behaviour, limiting their lifetime in operation. Indeed, oxidation occurs when they are in contact with disinfectants leading to the formation of a thin oxidised layer coupled to the cracks initiation of cracks of different lengths from the inner wall surface. An original method is proposed here to characterise the ageing effect of the pipe mechanical behaviour. Inspired from the ASTM D 2290 - 04 standard, <b>Nol</b> <b>Ring</b> tests have been performed under tensile and creep loadings on smooth rings. A constitutive equation has been determined from these tests using a finite element (FE) modelling. FE simulations have been performed to study the influence of the thin oxidised PE layer. Precracked specimens with different crack depth ratio have also been modelled. The crack depth ratio is an important parameter to quantify pipe ageing...|$|E
40|$|Filament wound <b>NOL</b> <b>rings,</b> 4 -inch and 8 -inch {{diameter}} closed-end vessels involving three {{epoxy resin}} systems and three graphite fibers were tested to develop property data and fabrication technology for filament wound graphite/epoxy pressure vessels. Vessels {{were subjected to}} single-cycle burst tests at room temperature. Manufacturing parameters were established for tooling, winding, and curing {{that resulted in the}} development of a pressure/vessel performance factor (pressure x volume/weight) or more than 900, 000 in. for an oblate spheroid specimen...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{investigations}} {{serve as}} comparative verification of silicone-aramid material designed for oesophageal prosthesis. Design/methodology/approach: In this work, non-standard research techniques, particularly designated for comparative tests of long-fibrous composite materials, are presented. Those tests {{are carried out}} on equipment similar to so called <b>NOL</b> <b>rings</b> test and pressure tests using rubber as a working mediumFindings: During interpretation of pressure tests results according to the proposed method, it should be {{paid attention to the}} state of stresses in the wall of investigated tubular element. Ignoring fractional resistance of the rubber with sample wall, it can be obtained uniaxial stress in circumferential direction. Research limitations: Proposed research methods (non-standard <b>NOL</b> <b>rings</b> and tests using axial compressed rubber) can be applied in evaluation of fabricated long-fibrous material, e. g. determination of degree of silicone material binding. Originality/value: Proposed methods of comparative tests are easy to make and the destruction point during static tests as well as fatigue ones is clearly determined. Results of investigations serve as comparative verification of silicon-aramid material designed for oesophageal prosthesis. Tested tubular element - prototype of oesophageal prosthesis requires the reduction of reinforcing material...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} SHM of Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPV) for high {{pressure}} hydrogen storage, based on embedded optical fibres and Rayleigh OFDR. Fibre Bragg Gratings in situ strain measurements on flat samples are first presented {{to assess the}} mechanical state of such anisotropic structures, and define a preliminary SHM criterion. Comparative fatigue tests were also performed on <b>NOL</b> <b>rings</b> to evaluate optical fibres mechanical impact, but their analysis in terms of energy revealed the difficulty to provide reliable results if the first cycles energy is not accurately controlled. Therefore, with no detrimental effect of the optical fibre embedment within the composite architecture, several instrumented pressure vessels were manufactured and tested. Accordingly, a mechanical criterion based on OFDR differential strain profiles analysis was defined to bring out internal defects, demonstrating the ability to early detect and locate internal flaws without requirements to inflate vessels at high pressures. Additionally, their sensitivity vs. pressure, analysed during a first burst test, provided additional valuable data about structure integrity. Finally, we define four complementary criteria based on in situ strain measurements to control pressure vessels for damage assessment, or any hydrostatic stressed structure since the underlying principles rely on strains proportionality vs. uniformly applied stresses...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHigh Density Polyethylene (HDPE) {{is widely}} used for the {{distribution}} of drinking water and are exposed to an internal pressure due to water flow. Furthermore, {{when they are in}} contact with disinfectants, oxidation of HDPE occurs at the immediate surface of the inner wall. This leads to a decrease in the HDPE molar mass and consequently, to a hardening as well as an embrittlement of the material. The oxidised layer thickness seems to stabilize at 200 Î¼m whatever the initial pipe thickness due to the diffusion of reactive species in the inner wall. Inspections with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) of the inner wall of pipes collected on site, after several years of service, showed a network of cracks. The most noxious (deepest) longitudinal crack propagates under the steady internal pressure until the complete failure of the pipe. The experimental investigations consisted of creep crack growth tests, carried out on an original geometry for this type of test using <b>NOL</b> <b>ring.</b> These specimens were cut from the pipes and an internal longitudinal crack implanted. Creep crack growth tests were performed at various net stresses and at various crack depth ratios. At the end of each test, the time to failure was recorded. Before applying the theory of fracture mechanics of creeping solids, 3 D finite element simulations were carried out to assess the suitability of assuming plane strain conditions. To this end, a porous viscoplastic model was implemented into an in-house finite element code. A fracture criterion based on critical porosity allowed for the simulation of creep crack growth. The localization of the maximum damage at mid-thickness and the thickness reduction were well captured. In these conditions, the crack front curvature is located near the surface so that a 2 D calculation with plane strain conditions can then be justified to determine the C* load parameter. The residual lifetime of a real pipe containing a longitudinal defect, under in-service loading was estimated by using the correlation between the time to failure and the C*-integral...|$|E
40|$|A {{new high}} modulus fiber was {{evaluated}} as a reinforcement for filament wound pressure vessels. Based on preliminary data it offers significant specific strength and modulus improvements over an S-glass reinforcement. Winding parameters and design data were {{established for the}} fiber with two different epoxy resin systems. <b>NOL</b> composite <b>rings</b> were evaluated for tensile strength, modulus and interlaminar shear strength at + 70 F, - 320 F and - 423 F. Results showed that the fiber reinforced composite exhibited a specific strength of 4, 100, 000 inches and a specific modulus of 290, 000, 000 inches compared to 3, 260, 000 inches and 110, 000, 000 inches respectively for S-glass. Utilizing this data to design small filament wound pressure vessels, a performance factor of 806, 000 inches was obtained experimentally with PRD 49 - 1 fiber compared to values of 632, 000 inches and 501, 000 inches for S-glass and high modulus graphite vessels, respectively...|$|R
