6000|$|This 'pidgin English' {{runs down}} West Africa, except the Gold Coast and about Accra, where the natives have learnt {{something}} better. The principal affirmation is 'Enh,' pronounced nanny-goat fashion, {{and they always}} answer 'Yes' to a negative question: e.g. Q. 'Didn't you go then?' A. 'Yes' (sub-audi, I did not), thus meaning 'No.' 'Na,' apparently an interrogative in origin, is used pleonastically on all occasions: 'You <b>na</b> <b>go</b> na steamer?' 'Enty' means indeed; 'too much,' very; 'one time,' once; and {{the sign of the}} vocative, as in the Southern States of the Union, follows the, word:' Daddy, oh!' 'Mammy, oh!' 'Puss,' or 'tittle,' is a girl, perhaps a pretty girl; 'babboh,' a boy. 'Hear' is to obey or understand; 'look,' to see; 'catch,' to have; 'lib,' to live, to be, to be found, or to enjoy good health: it is applied equally to inanimates. 'Done lib' means die; 'sabby' (Portuguese) is to know; 'chop,' to eat; 'cut the cry,' to end a wake; 'jam head,' or 'go for jam head,' to take counsel; 'palaver (Port.) set,' to end a dispute; to 'cut yamgah' is to withhold payment, and to 'make nyanga' is to junket. 'Yam' is food; 'tummach' (Port.) is the metaphorical heart; 'cockerapeak' is early dawn, when the cock speaks; all writing, as well as printing, is a 'book;' a quarrel is a 'bob;' and all presents are a 'dash,' 'dassy' in Barbot, and 'dashs' in Ogilby. All bulls are cows, and when you would specify sex you say 'man-cow' or 'woman-cow.'

50|$|Cassidy's book is one {{of those}} eureka moments that leap beyond the {{ordinary}} to give us a new understanding of the subject at hand.So utterly, completely stupid, only a total nincompoop like Cassidy could have come up with it.… the problem with the book {{is that there is no}} scholarship or real evidence at all in it.Tá Cassidy imithe ar shlí na fírinne anois, is é mo mhórdhóchas <b>ná</b> <b>go</b> n-imeoidh na bréaga seo leis.

Do not buy this book and do not support nonsense like this.)Cassidy&rsquo;s main thesis - that there are far more English words of Irish origin than are acknowledged in volumes such as the OED, and that this is due to the fact that much of the Irish influence is found among lower-status, colloquial slang expressions - is very convincing, but the etymologies he proposes for individual words would require a substantial amount of research before they could be taken as fact.Cassidy paints himself as the maligned scholar, the unappreciated genius, the outsider. He may be all of those things, but he is them by choice: his work cannot withstand scholarly scrutiny so he simply cannot afford to join forces with any larger body of experts who do this sort of thing for a living. His book falls apart on first reading by anyone with some expertise in the field.|$|E

40|$|A ginástica olímpica (GO) envolve atividades motoras que exigem capacidades específicas. Todavia, há carência de testes para detectar o potencial para o desempenho <b>na</b> <b>GO</b> em idades precoces. Este estudo descreve e apresenta evidências da validade de uma bateria de testes para a seleção de talentos para GO feminina. Inicialmente, foram levantadas as atividades que vêm sendo aplicadas por especialistas em GO, na {{literatura}} e por consulta através de questionários. A partir das 30 atividades mencionadas, foi delineada uma bateria de testes com 22 atividades, aplicada em 55 crianças de cinco a nove anos de idade. Com uso de técnicas de análise fatorial, os escores fatoriais individuais foram calculados para o primeiro fator, sendo adotados como variável independente representativa do potencial das crianças para o desempenho em GO (PDGO). Uma regressão múltipla passo a passo gerou uma equação por meio da qual o PDGO era estimado a partir de apenas oito atividades. A validade cruzada da bateria e do índice PDGO foi verificada em 16 ginastas experientes e 19 crianças de escolinha. As primeiras obtiveram médias significativamente maiores (PDGO = 85, 1) que as últimas (PDGO = 54, 8), indicando que a bateria discriminou bem o potencial geral para o desempenho. Confirmou-se a validade construto com base na estrutura da análise fatorial, já que as atividades agruparam-se em torno de uma única dimensão do desempenho motor. Para a fidedignidade inter e intra-observadores, obtiveram-se correlações de 0, 83 a 1, 00, sem diferenças entre as médias nas situações observadas. Conclui-se que a bateria de testes, além de ser de aplicação rápida, simples, de baixo custo e fácil entendimento, reveste-se de validade e reprodutibilidade, podendo ser aplicada na seleção inicial de talentos para a GO. Estudos adicionais, porém, deveriam ser conduzidos para confirmação dos presentes resultados, envolvendo amostras maiores e abordagem longitudinal para estabelecimento da validade preditiva do método. The artistic gymnastics (AG) {{is based}} {{on a wide range of}} motor activities that require specific capacities. However, tests to detect the potential for its excellence in early ages are still lacking. The purpose of the present study was to develop a test for talent selection in female artistic gymnastics. The activities used by Brazilian specialists were investigated by questionnaire and the international literature was reviewed. The 30 mentioned activities were compiled in a 22 -test battery that was applied in 55 children of 5 to 9 years-old. Results obtained were treated by principal component factor analysis. Individual factor scores were extracted from the first factor, which were adopted as an indicator of the performance potential in artistic gymnastics (PPAG). At last, a stepwise multiple regression was calculated, using the factor scores as independent variable, producing an equation with eight activities to estimate PPAG. Construct validity, cross validity and reliability of the equation were tested. Sixteen experienced gymnasts and 19 apprentices were tested for cross validation. Mean PPAG found for the gymnasts (85. 11) was significantly higher than data for the apprentices (54. 80), indicating that the battery can discriminate the performance potential. Construct validity was confirmed by exploratory factor analysis, suggesting that the activities were related to a similar dimension of motor performance. Inter- and intra-observers reliability was tested by linear correlation and Student t test. The correlation values ranged between 0. 83 and 1. 00 (p < 0. 05). No differences were detected between the means in all test situations. In conclusion, the application of the proposed battery revealed to be fast and simple, as well associated with low cost and easy understanding. Furthermore, data suggested that it has good validity and reproducibility, authorizing its application in initial talent selection for AG. However, additional studies should be conducted to confirm these results, including more important samples and longitudinal approaches, in order to verify the predictive validity of the method...|$|E

The H source for the addition radicals may be an H- 2 - 0 impurity in the sample, with which the Na atoms combine to release the H atoms.
