40|$|Understanding the {{relationship}} between landscape patterns and ecological processes has been a central yet challenging research theme in landscape ecology. Over the past decades, many landscape metrics have been proposed but few directly incorporated ecological processes. In this paper, we developed a landscape index, namely, location-weighted landscape index (LWLI) to highlight the role of landscape type in ecological processes, such as <b>nutrient</b> <b>losses</b> and soil erosion. Within {{the framework of the}} Lorenz curve theory, we develop this index by integrating landscape pattern and point-based measurements at a watershed scale. The index can be used to characterize the contribution of landscape pattern to ecological processes (e. g. <b>nutrient</b> <b>losses)</b> with respect to a specific monitoring point in a watershed. Through a case study on <b>nutrient</b> <b>losses</b> in an agricultural area in northeastern China, we found that <b>nutrient</b> <b>losses</b> tended to be higher for a watershed with a higher LWLI value, and vice versa. It implied that LWLI can be used to evaluate the potential risk of <b>nutrient</b> <b>losses</b> or soil erosion by comparing their values across watersheds. In addition, this index can be extended to characterize ecological processes, such as the effect of landscape pattern on wildlife inhabitation and urban heat island effect. Finally, we discuss several problems that should be paid attention to when applying this index to a heterogeneous landscape site...|$|R

Mixed <b>nutrient</b> <b>losses</b> are inevitable from any drained system, but assessing processes leading {{to differences in}} nutrient speciation, fractionation and losses in grasslands between locations or flowpaths is important to achieve sustainability. This study investigates these processes in overland flow and subsurface drains over three rainfall events from four non-grazed plots recently converted from marginal land in the southeast of Ireland. A shallower water table and smaller plot size resulted in greater water and <b>nutrient</b> <b>losses</b> in overland flow per unit of land area. <b>Nutrient</b> <b>losses</b> were less in subsurface drains. Dissolved organic nitrogen dominated, but dissolved inorganic nitrogen was more abundant in the drains. Particulate phosphorus generally dominated in drains, except in plots with a shallow water table where dissolved unreactive phosphorus (DUP) was more abundant. In overland flow, a shallower water table resulted in a switch from dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) to DUP. Fertilization strongly increased phosphorus losses in overland flow, with DRP dominating. These results highlight the importance of an integrated assessment of the controls on flow and <b>nutrient</b> <b>losses</b> to design drainage systems in marginal lands...|$|R

In {{the first part of this}} report, quality of mainly cattle manure, and <b>nutrient</b> <b>losses</b> during manure collection and storage are reviewed. The second part explores and discusses effects of eight cattle and manure management scenarios on nutrient and manure availability. Nutrient excretion and manure quality strongly vary, due to variation in feed quality and intake, addition of organic material, <b>nutrient</b> <b>losses</b> and contamination with soil. Total nitrogen content of manure on a dry matter basis ranges from below 0. 5 to over 4 %. Contents of soluble nitrogen (ammonia N) also strongly vary. <b>Nutrient</b> and carbon <b>losses</b> during manure collection and storage vary substantially, depending on cattle and manure management. Nitrogen losses for example may vary from less than 10 % to about 90 %. Nitrogen losses tend to be lower for more compact and anaerobic manure storage systems and for manures with higher carbon to nitrogen ratios. On the basis of the review, a summary table is constructed, giving indicative <b>nutrient</b> <b>losses</b> for six different systems of collection and storage of cattle manure.
