Rantula also beat Bhudakhan in Penn Hills (June 8) and Canonsburg, Pennsylvania (August 17). On September 28, T. Rantula was pinned by Dennis Gregory in a no-disqualification match after outside interference from Brian O. This was an impromptu bout when Gregory, after defeating his original opponent J-Ru, challenged promoter Norm Conners to send out another wrestler. Later that <b>night,</b> <b>T.</b> Rantula interfered in Brian O's match by powerbombing him though a table and allowing Matt Vandal to score the pinfall. A match was quickly signed between T.

40|$|Green roofs {{are a new}} {{and growing}} field in North America. Along {{with the need for}} {{innovation}} in design, research on green roof systems and performance is necessary to capture and improve the way in which green roofs function. Green roof performance and benefits have traditionally been measured by their ability to capture storm water, cool the building below it by means of shading and evaporative cooling, and their ability to successfully support plant life. Currently, green roofs design is dominated by shallow, light weight substrates and extremely drought tolerant plants, often from the Crassulaceae. This design predilection is based upon the limiting factors of building loading limits and installation costs. However, this design negates most of the benefits green roofs are expected to provide. Water holding capacity, and thus the green roof’s ability to retain significant volumes of storm water, is contingent on the depth of the substrate. By selecting plant species which are highly drought tolerant, the evapotranspiration rates are reduced. Additionally, many members of the Crassulaceae have an inverted stomatal rhythm wherein stomates are open at <b>night</b> <b>t...</b>|$|E
40|$|Before we {{continue}} I want {{to clarify the}} main points {{that you should have}} taken away after reading part 1 and provide some scientific references for those who are still skeptical of the true function of the abdominal muscles. There is no spot reduction of body fat with ANY exercise or piece of gym equipment. The devices on late <b>night</b> <b>t.</b> v. are scams & gimmicks. Repeated flexion & rotation of the spine i. e. crunches is a mechanism for injury. The “true ” function of the abdominal muscles is to prevent forced or unwanted flexion and rotation of the spine. Of course this goes against what the media preaches as correct exercise but the media is designed to sell products & services, not provide accurate exercise information. Here are some direct quotes regarding abdominal function from top doctors, therapists, and scientists: Dr. Shirely Sahrmann states “A large percentage of low back problems occur because the abdominal muscles are not maintaining tight control over the rotation between the pelvis and the spine at the L 5 - S 1 level.

40|$|Cubozoan medusae have a stereotypic set of 24 eyes, some {{of which}} are {{structurally}} similar to vertebrate and cephalopod eyes. Across the approximately 25 described species, this set of eyes varies surprisingly little, suggesting that they are involved in an equally stereotypic set of visual tasks. During the day Tripedalia cystophora is found at the edge of mangrove lagoons where it accumulates close to the surface in sun-lit patches between the prop roots. Copula sivickisi (formerly named Carybdea sivickisi) is associated with coral reefs and has been observed to be active at night. At least superficially, the eyes of the two species are close to identical. We studied the diurnal activity pattern of these two species both in the wild and under controlled conditions in laboratory experiments. Despite the very similar visual systems, we found that they display opposite patterns of diurnal activity. T. cystophora is active exclusively during the day, whereas C. sivickisi is actively swimming at night, when it forages and mates. At <b>night</b> <b>T.</b> cystophora is found on the muddy bottom of the mangrove lagoon. C. sivickisi spends the day attached to structures such as the underside of stones and coral skeletons. This species difference seems to have evolved to optimize foraging, since the patterns of activity follow those of the available prey items in their respective habitats...|$|E
40|$|The New England {{region of}} the northeastern United States has a land use history {{characterized}} by forest clearing for agriculture and other uses during European colonization and subsequent reforestation following widespread farm abandonment. Despite these broad changes, the potential influence on local and regional climate has received relatively little attention. This study investigated wintertime (December through March) climate impacts of reforestation in New England using a high-resolution (4 km) multiphysics ensemble of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model. In general, the conversion from mid- 1800 s cropland/grassland to forest led to warming, but results were sensitive to physics parameterizations. The 2 -m maximum temperature (T 2 max) was most sensitive to choice of land surface model, 2 -m minimum temperature (T 2 min) was sensitive to radiation scheme, and all ensemble members simulated precipitation poorly. Reforestation experiments suggest that conversion of mid- 1800 s cropland/grassland to present-day forest warmed T 2 max + 0. 5 to + 3 K, with weaker warming during a warm, dry winter compared to a cold, snowy winter. Warmer T 2 max over forests was primarily the result of increased absorbed shortwave radiation and increased sensible heat flux compared to cropland/grassland. At <b>night,</b> <b>T</b> 2 min warmed + 0. 2 to + 1. 5 K where deciduous broadleaf forest replaced cropland/grassland, a result of decreased ground heat flux. By contrast, T 2 min of evergreen needleleaf forest cooled – 0. 5 to – 2. 1 K, primarily owing to increased ground heat flux and decreased sensible heat flux...|$|E
40|$|In 1966 - 1969 euphausiids (krill) were sampled in some fjords in Western Norway. Drained {{volumes of}} krill {{constituted}} 13 - 82 ml, exceptionally 100 - 167 ml per 1 000 m 3. Meganyctiphanes norvegica, Thysanoessa inermis and T. raschii dominated {{in the order}} mentioned. During the day, Thysanoessa spp. kept at higher levels than M. norvegica; during the <b>night</b> <b>T.</b> raschii {{and part of the}} stock of M. norvegica accumulated close to the surface. M. norvegica had densities of 0. 1 - 1 specimens per m 3, but higher concentrations were induced in spring with electric light. Vertical layering was observed with large specimens at deeper levels. M. norvegica spawned in March-June one year old. Part of the stock survived a second spawning, a few lived for nearly three years. One year olds measured 22 - 31 mm (average 27 mm), two year olds 32 - 41 mm (average 37 mm) and three year olds 43 - 47 mm. In T. inermis a maximum of 1 - 4 specimens per m 3 occurred in the upper 10 - 50 m during the night in January-February and October-November, at other times only 0. 05 - 0. 3 specimens per m 3. T. inermis is annual in the area, spawning in March- June, with maximum in April. Length of one year olds was 17 - 20 mm, single second year survivors 26 mm. The two-spined form was observed in 1 - 3 % of the stock. T. raschii had maximum densities of 3. 5 and 5. 0 specimens per m 3 in the upper 10 m in February and November respectively, at other times figures were very low. T. raschii is annual; spawning occurs in April-June, starting somewhat later than in T. inermis. Growth and length distributions are as a rule similar to those of T. inermis...|$|E
