5|$|Air Mata Iboe was {{the last}} film {{produced}} by Majestic Film Company, which closed following the Japanese occupation. During the occupation Njoo, Fifi Young, and Fred Young established their own travelling theatrical troupe, Pantjawarna, though all returned to cinema in the 1950s.

5|$|Although van der Weyden did not title the work, and the sitter's name is <b>not</b> <b>recorded</b> {{in any of}} {{the early}} inventories, the style of her dress has been used to place the picture very late in van der Weyden's career. The c.1460 dating is based on the high-fashion dress and the work's {{apparent}} chronological position in the evolution of van der Weyden's style. However, it is possible that it was executed even later (van der Weyden died in 1464).|$|E
5|$|Because fossils {{identifiable}} as P. sternbergi {{are found}} {{exclusively in the}} lower layers of the Niobrara Formation, and P. longiceps fossils exclusively in the upper layers, a fossil lacking the skull can be identified based on {{its position in the}} geologic column (though for many early fossil finds, precise data about its location was <b>not</b> <b>recorded,</b> rendering many fossils unidentifiable).|$|E
5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, whole-body extract immunotherapy {{was widely}} used {{due to its}} apparent effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only immunotherapy used for ant stings.

In 2003, ant venom immunotherapy was shown to be safe and effective against Myrmecia venom.|$|E
