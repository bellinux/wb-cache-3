5|$|These radars {{have been}} {{installed}} at six different radar stations {{and as of}} 2012 are operational at three – Balkhash, Mishelevka and Olenegorsk. The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty required that early warning radars were located {{on the periphery of}} national territory and faced outwards. This caused problems when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 as many of the radar stations were now in <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> states. The first station to close was Skrunda, in <b>newly</b> <b>independent</b> Latvia. A 1994 agreement between Russia and Latvia agreed that the two Dnepr radars there would stop working in 1998, and would be fully demolished by 2000.|$|E
