5000|$|The American <b>Lithographic</b> <b>Stone</b> Company was {{organized}} in Louisville, Kentucky in late 1868. It initially focused its operation on quarries in Overton County, Tennessee, but shortly before 1900, it opened a quarry at Brandenburg, Kentucky. This quarry {{was the only}} commercial source of <b>lithographic</b> <b>stone</b> in the United States {{at the turn of}} the 20th century. Unlike the Solnhofen <b>stone,</b> Kentucky <b>lithographic</b> limestone was slightly dolomitic, and it was judged to be competitive with Solnhofen stone for some purposes, but not for the highest quality work. [...] This stone source was sub-Carboniferous (Mississippian). [...] In 1917, the Brandenburg quarry was judged the most important source of <b>Lithographic</b> <b>stone</b> in the United States. [...] Prior to 1916, the output of the Brandenburg quarry was small, but in 1916, as World War I cut off access to Solnhofen stone, the quarry produced 20 tons of finished <b>lithographic</b> <b>stone.</b> [...] The Remains of the Brandenburg Lithograph Quarry are located along the Buttermilk Falls Historic Walking Trail (...)

5000|$|The {{nights of}} June 19 [...] December 20, 1875, saw a fire sweep through the central printer. This fire killed four people, and Heinrich Neuhaus' unique {{panorama}} of Stockholm was destroyed. The panorama, {{which was in}} the process of printing, as well as the <b>lithographic</b> <b>stones,</b> were rendered useless.|$|R
60|$|The vulgar {{economist}} would {{reply that}} his science {{had nothing to}} do with the qualities of pictures, but with their exchange-value only; and that his business was, exclusively, to consider whether the remains of Tintoret were worth as many ten-and-sixpences as the impressions which might be taken from the <b>lithographic</b> <b>stones.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lewis was {{a pioneer}} in colour {{lithography}} in Canada, using different <b>lithographic</b> <b>stones</b> for each transparent ink color to give a gradual transitional effect in the print. He was also interested in art of the Italian Renaissance and Inuit sculpture, spending several winters in the Canadian arctic to perfect his artistic skills.|$|R

He was also a good {{draftsman}} and did his own drawings, also taking care of their transfer to the <b>lithographic</b> <b>stone.</b> Many of his medical articles were published in Pitha and Bilroth's Handbuch der allgemeinen und speciellen Chirurgie. He was the author of the following books: ...|$|R
50|$|Chromolithography {{was another}} process, {{which by the}} end of the 19th century had become dominant, {{although}} this used multiple prints with a stone for each color. Mechanical color separation, initially using photographs of the image taken with three different color filters, reduced the number of prints needed to three. Zincography, with zinc plates, later replaced <b>lithographic</b> <b>stones,</b> and remained the most common method of color printing until the 1930s.|$|R
50|$|Helen Halley Brewster {{was born}} in Oakland, California, on October 10, 1894, the {{daughter}} of Charles Union Brewster (1862-1920) and Bertha Halley. She was the granddaughter of John Alexander Brewster, the fourth California Surveyor General, serving from 1856 to 1858. In 1908 her father invented and patented the Automatic Ruling-Machine, a machine for ruling a series of lines on <b>lithographic</b> <b>stones,</b> metal plates or in kindred processes or uses.|$|R
50|$|Senefelder was {{decorated}} by King Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria and {{a statue of}} him stands {{in the town of}} Solnhofen, where <b>lithographic</b> <b>stone</b> is still quarried. A statue of Alois Senefelder by sculptor Rudolf Pohle was erected in 1892 in what was then known as Thusneldaplatz in Berlin. The name of the square was changed to Senefelderplatz in 1894. An U-Bahn station named Senefelderplatz was opened in 1913.|$|R
5000|$|In 1907, {{the firm}} was {{liquidated}} {{and most of the}} <b>lithographic</b> <b>stones</b> had the image removed and were sold by the pound, with some stones' final home being as land fill in Central Park. Those few stones that managed to survive intact were of large folio Clipper Ships, small folio Dark Town Comics, a medium folio [...] "Abraham Lincoln" [...] and a small folio [...] "Washington As A Mason".|$|R

You must think first and this is hard to do. But I am happy doing the prints." [...] Though not active as a printmaker, Pitseolak’s drawing process did however extend to working directly on copper plates and, to a lesser degree, <b>lithographic</b> <b>stones.</b>|$|R

Karthikappally church keeps an immense archive of the local history in about 621palmyra-written records.The church became the centre of attraction recently as two lithograph records and the remnants suspected to be that of a metropolitan were unearthed from the church premises. The <b>lithographic</b> <b>stones</b> have been identified to be 300 years old.|$|R
50|$|Among these First Printing stamps, {{at least}} six sheets with the red frames had been {{inadvertently}} placed in the press backwards. So, although the heads appear to be upside down, it was the red frames that were inverted. D.N. Jatia found that {{at least six}} sheets must have been fed into the press upside-down, inasmuch as six of these stamps from Position 4 showed different <b>lithographic</b> <b>stones</b> {{were used for the}} head and frame dies.|$|R
50|$|In 1877, they {{launched}} a new magazine Illustrated Family Journal (Danish: Illustreret Familie Journal), with Laura Aller as editor-in-chief. The magazine experienced immediate success, {{partly due to the}} high quality of its illustrations. Aller improved printing techniques by transferring them to a <b>lithographic</b> <b>stone</b> and was for a long time the only publisher in Denmark to offer illustrations in nine colours. The company expanded fast, both through organic growth and acquisitions of numerous other printing businesses.|$|R

Very {{few of the}} prints were published, however, possibly because the <b>lithographic</b> <b>stone</b> broke {{early on in the}} printing process [...] . Interestingly, the image may have achieved its widest circulation in a number of pirated editions issued by rival printmakers, both in separate sheets and for at least one picture newspaper.

5000|$|Halftone {{processes}} allow photographs, {{complete with}} their [...] "half-tone" [...] intermediate {{shades of gray}} or color, to be reproduced in ink on paper {{by means of a}} printing press, like text. Prior to such processes, images were printed in books and periodicals by means of hand-engraved metal plates or wood blocks, or from drawings made on <b>lithographic</b> <b>stones.</b> Half-tone effects were obtained by engraving closely spaced parallel or hatched lines, by stippling, or by exploiting the granular texture inherent in the stone lithography process.|$|R
50|$|Montaut's printmaking career {{started in}} the late 19th century. He used a <b>lithographic</b> <b>stone</b> to produce an outline of the image, the Pochoir process, often {{including}} the year of publication, the artist's name {{and that of the}} printer Mabileau et Cie., Paris. Printed on the image was also a descriptive title advertising cars, tires, carburettors etc., and various sponsoring firms. The outlines were then painted by hand using watercolour paints. The process took a few days for each print and was quite labour-intensive. The different artists resulted in noticeable variations in colour.|$|R
50|$|Several {{quarries}} above Montdardier were formerly important {{sources of}} <b>lithographic</b> limestone. <b>Stone</b> from these quarries, marketed as Vigan stone, earned an honorable {{mention in the}} Great Exhibition of 1851.|$|R

25|$|Controlled by {{his fear}} of Hell, Teodoro went to Father Mariano Gíl, an Augustinian parish curate of the Tondo convent. Though he is willed to tell {{anything}} about the Katipunan, Teodoro confessed to Father Gíl that a <b>lithographic</b> <b>stone</b> was hidden in the press-room of Diario de Manila, which {{was used by the}} society for printing receipts. He also said that aside from the stone, there were also documents of membership (that uses member's blood for signing) hidden, together with a picture of Dr. José Rizal and several daggers that was made for the katipunero-employees of the newspaper.|$|R

The Steamship Room illustrates the evolution of maritime technology from wind to steam, and there are displays of <b>lithographic</b> <b>stones,</b> scrimshaw, and whaling guns and photo-murals of San Francisco's early waterfront. A visiting-attractions gallery hosts such exhibition as Sparks (2005), which showcased shipboard radio, radiotelephone, and radioteletype equipment from over the years.|$|R
50|$|Niépce {{dissolved}} bitumen in lavender oil, {{a solvent}} {{often used in}} varnishes, and thinly coated it onto a <b>lithographic</b> <b>stone</b> or a sheet of metal or glass. After the coating had dried, a test subject, typically an engraving printed on paper, was laid over the surface in close contact and the two were put out in direct sunlight. After sufficient exposure, the solvent {{could be used to}} rinse away only the unhardened bitumen that had been shielded from light by lines or dark areas in the test subject. The parts of the surface thus laid bare could then be etched with acid, or the remaining bitumen could serve as the water-repellent material in lithographic printing.|$|R
50|$|The most {{abundant}} {{make up for}} the ground in Khmelnytskyi are layers of the following overburden: loess and loess-type rocks. The ground-climatic conditions of Khmelnytskyi are favorable for the cultivation of winter wheat and rye, sugar beet, potato and other crops. Khmelnytskyi is also ideal for the development of gardening and vegetable growing. In the territory of Khmelnytskyi there are the vegetations of two geobotanical zones of Ukraine: Polissya and forest-steppe. Khmelnytskyi and its greater region supplies many rock products, particularly building materials such as: limestone, plaster, chalk, tripoli powder, crystal layers (granites, gneisses), sand, sandstones, and also graphite, saponite, kaolin, phosphorite, <b>lithographic</b> <b>stone</b> and roofing slate. There are also deposits of peat, bitumen, shale and oil.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{photoengraving}} {{process was}} developed in the 1820s by Nicéphore Niépce, best known as the creator of the so-called [...] "first photograph", which used photoresist to make a one-off camera photograph rather than a printing plate. His usual test subjects were paper prints of conventional engravings, and exposure was by contact under direct sunlight rather than by the use of a camera. Several metals were tried for the printing plate, as well as glass and <b>lithographic</b> <b>stone.</b> His first success came in 1822. The earliest known surviving example of a paper print made from one of his photoengraved plates dates to 1825 and reproduces a 17th-century engraving. It has very controversially been called the oldest photograph.|$|R
50|$|As {{with many}} {{towns in the}} Cévennes, there were many textile {{industries}} there in the past. Several quarries south of town above Montdardier were formerly important sources of <b>lithographic</b> limestone. <b>Stone</b> from these quarries earned an honorable mention in the Great Exhibition of 1851.|$|R
50|$|In 1834 he {{produced}} the lithograph Rue Transnonain, 15 April 1834 depicting the massacre in the rue transnoin which {{was part of}} the April 1834 riots in Paris. It was designed for the subscription publication L’Association Mensuelle. The profits were to promote freedom of the press and defrayed legal costs of a lawsuit against the satirical, politically progressive journal Le Charivari to which Daumier contributed regularly. The police discovered the print hanging in the window of printseller Ernest Jean Aubert in the Galerie Véro-Dodat (passageway in 1st arrondissement) and subsequently tracked down and confiscated as many of the prints they could find, along with the original <b>lithographic</b> <b>stone</b> on which the image was drawn. Existing prints of Rue Transnonain are survivors of this effort.|$|R
25|$|During the 20th century, a {{group of}} artists, {{including}} Braque, Calder, Chagall, Dufy, Léger, Matisse, Miró, and Picasso, rediscovered the largely undeveloped artform of lithography thanks to the Mourlot Studios, also known as Atelier Mourlot, a Parisian printshop founded in 1852 by the Mourlot family. The Atelier Mourlot originally specialized in the printing of wallpaper; but it was transformed when the founder's grandson, Fernand Mourlot, invited a number of 20th-century artists to explore the complexities of fine art printing. Mourlot encouraged the painters to work directly on <b>lithographic</b> <b>stones</b> {{in order to create}} original artworks that could then be executed under the direction of master printers in small editions. The combination of modern artist and master printer resulted in lithographs that were used as posters to promote the artists' work.|$|R
50|$|From her {{earliest}} efforts onward, {{her pictures}} were artful celebrations of ordinariness. In them, Dwight's empathy for her subjects is apparent {{as well as}} her droll sense of humor. When she gave her Monkey House print the title The Brothers she was not making fun of the apes or the workmen spectators, but rather the priest who, shown turning his back on the scene, makes the picture into a gentle Darwinian joke. While most of her prints were black and white, a few, including Guignolette (1927), were enhanced by muted colors. As she pulled them off the <b>lithographic</b> <b>stone,</b> she would send proofs to Zigrosser for his critical review and after she returned to New York in 1927 he put her in touch with printmaker George Miller, whose expertise was the equal of the master printers at the Atelier Duchatel.|$|R
50|$|Fitch was {{involved}} in fabric printing {{from the age of}} 17 and took to botanical art after meeting William Jackson Hooker, Regius Professor of Botany, a competent botanical illustrator, and the editor of Curtis's Botanical Magazine. Fitch's first lithograph of Mimulus roseus appeared in the Botanical Magazine in 1834, and he soon became its sole artist. In 1841 W.J. Hooker became director of Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and Fitch moved to London. After 1841 Fitch was the sole artist for all official and unofficial publications issued by Kew; his work was paid for by Hooker personally. It was not unusual for him to work on several different publications simultaneously; he could draw directly onto the <b>lithographic</b> <b>stone</b> to save time. These chromolithographs were based on botanical illustrations provided by Hooker and others, and produced some of his most spectacular results.|$|R
5000|$|This {{event was}} [...] "caricatured" [...] by the journal La Caricature under its editor Charles Philipon, {{specifically}} in a lithograph by its prized satirical draughtsman Honoré Daumier, entitled Rue Transnonain, le 15 Avril 1834. According to {{a slightly different}} account, the lithograph was designed for the subscription publication L’Association Mensuelle. The profits were to promote {{freedom of the press}} and defrayed legal costs of a lawsuit against the satirical, politically progressive journal Le Charivari to which Daumier contributed regularly. The police discovered the print hanging in the window of printseller Ernest Jean Aubert in the Galerie Véro-Dodat (a passageway in 1st arrondissement) and subsequently tracked down and confiscated as many of the prints they could find, along with the original <b>lithographic</b> <b>stone</b> on which the image was drawn.
