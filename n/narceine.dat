They are derived from berberine, tetrahydroberberine, protopine and benzophenanthridine in Papaveroideae, and from spirobenzylisoquinoline and cularine in Fumarioideae, {{as well as from}} other groups that give them pharmacological properties: derivatives of aporphine, morphinan, pavine, isopavine, <b>narceine</b> and rhoeadine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Narceine</b> is an opium {{alkaloid}} {{produced by the}} Papaver somniferum (opium poppy) plant. It is a bitter, crystalline compound with narcotic effects. It was formerly used {{as a substitute for}} morphine. Its name is derived from the Greek [...] (nárkē), meaning numbness, and the postfix -ine referring to an alkaloid.|$|E
5000|$|He is {{credited}} with the popularization of the hypodermic syringe in France, a device that had been invented in 1853. He is also known for his pioneer experimentation with the opiate <b>narceine,</b> and for his advocacy of hydrotherapy (cold water baths) and alcohol (a [...] "Todd's mixture" [...] containing brandy) {{for the treatment of}} typhoid fever. With dermatologist Alfred Hardy, he is associated with the eponym [...] "Béhier-Hardy symptom" [...] (also known as [...] "Béhier-Hardy aphonia"), described as the loss of voice {{as a sign of the}} early stages of pulmonary gangrene.|$|E

Among the test, phytopathogens the spores of F. udum, C. maculans and H. penniseti were highly sensitive at 200 ppm. However, spores of E. pisi, A. solani and A. tagetica were less sensitive at low concentration followed by other test fungi. Most of the fungi showed zero or nearly zero percent spore germination at 400 and 500 ppm...|$|E
40|$|A {{straightforward}} method {{to determine the}} content of six opium alkaloids (morphine, codeine, thebaine, noscapine, papaverine and <b>narceine)</b> in poppy seeds and bakery products was developed and validated down to a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0. 1 mg/kg. The method was based on extraction with acetonitrile/water/formic acid, ten-fold dilution and analysis by LC-MS/MS using a pH 10 carbonate buffer. The method was applied {{for the analysis of}} 41 samples collected in 2015 in the Netherlands and Germany. All samples contained morphine ranging from 0. 2 to 240 mg/kg. The levels of codeine and thebaine ranged from below LOQ to 348 mg/kg and from below LOQ to 106 mg/kg, respectively. Sixty percent of the samples exceeded the guidance reference value of 4 mg/kg of morphine set by BfR in Germany, whereas 25 % of the samples did not comply with the limits set for morphine, codeine, thebaine and noscapine by Hungarian legislation. </p...|$|E

Recently, in search for new treat-ments for cancer, there has been an emphasis on herbal and natural compounds. Cytotoxic effects of some mem-bers of Papaveraceae family have been considered in other compounds [4]. Many studies revealed a remarkable anti-tumor activity of the alkaloid noscapine, a naturally-occurring benzylisoquinoline alkaloid that constitutes about 2 - 10 % of the alkaloid content of opium [5, 6]. Fur-thermore, the anti-tumor {{activities of}} noscapine and its tubulin-binding property have been mentioned in many studies [7 - 12].
