Time-based competition is a broad-based competitive strategy emphasizing time as the major factor for achieving and maintaining a sustainable competitive advantage. It seeks to compress the time required to propose, develop, manufacture, market and deliver products http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/management/Str-Ti/Time-Based-Competition.html.QRM advocates a companywide focus on short lead times that include quick response to demand for existing products as well as new product and design changes. This combination has led to the implementation of QRM in many high-mix, low-volume companies.|$|R

The types of aircraft that are used for sport and recreation are classified as gliders (sailplanes), hang gliders and paragliders. These two latter types are often foot-launched. The design of all three types enables them to repeatedly climb using rising air and then to glide before finding the <b>next</b> <b>source</b> of lift. When done in gliders (sailplanes), the sport is known as gliding and sometimes as soaring. For foot-launched aircraft, it is known as hang gliding and paragliding.

This method makes adaptive processing more straight-forward, making it less sensitive to imperfections in the data and the acquisition geometry and more suitable for the application to field data. In addition, it is cheaper and can be parallelized by pair of focal points. Applied Geophysics and PetrophysicsImPhys/Acoustical Wavefield Imagin...|$|R
