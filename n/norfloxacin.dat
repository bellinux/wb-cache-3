25|$|The European Medicines Agency, also in 2008, had {{recommended}} restricting {{the use of}} oral <b>norfloxacin</b> to treat urinary infections. CHMP had concluded that the marketing authorizations for <b>norfloxacin,</b> when used {{in the treatment of}} acute or chronic complicated pyelonephritis, should be withdrawn because the benefits do not outweigh their risks in this indication. CHMP stated that doctors should not prescribe oral <b>norfloxacin</b> for complicated pyelonephritis and should consider switching patients already taking oral <b>norfloxacin</b> for this type of infection to an alternative antibiotic.|$|E
25|$|The {{concomitant}} {{administration of}} a {{non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug}} (NSAID) with a quinolone, including <b>norfloxacin,</b> may {{increase the risk of}} CNS stimulation and convulsive seizures. Therefore, <b>norfloxacin</b> should be used with caution in individuals receiving NSAIDS concomitantly.|$|E
25|$|<b>Norfloxacin</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to rapidly cross the blood-placenta and blood-milk barrier, and is extensively distributed into the fetal tissues. For this reason <b>norfloxacin</b> and other fluoroquinolones are contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of spontaneous abortions and birth defects. The fluoroquinolones have also been reported as being present in the mother’s milk and are passed on to the nursing child, which may increases the risk of the child suffering an adverse reaction even though the child had never been prescribed or taken any of the drugs found within this class. As safer alternatives are generally available <b>norfloxacin</b> is contraindicated during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. The manufacturer only recommends use of <b>norfloxacin</b> during pregnancy when benefit outweighs risk.|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>norfloxacin</b> {{concomitantly}} {{has also}} been associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine in patients receiving cyclosporine, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia with sulfonylurea. Renal tubular transport of methotrexate may be inhibited by concomitant administration of <b>norfloxacin,</b> potentially leading to increased plasma levels of methotrexate. This might {{increase the risk of}} methotrexate toxic reactions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Norfloxacin</b> is also {{considered}} to be contraindicated within the pediatric population.|$|E
25|$|See {{the latest}} package insert for <b>norfloxacin</b> (Noroxin) for {{additional}} details.|$|E
25|$|In ophthalmology, <b>Norfloxacin</b> {{licensed}} use {{is limited}} to the treatment of conjunctival infections caused by susceptible bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Note: <b>Norfloxacin</b> may be {{licensed}} {{for other}} uses, or restricted, {{by the various}} regulatory agencies worldwide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Norfloxacin</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in those}} {{with a history of}} tendonitis, tendon rupture and those with a hypersensitivity to fluoroquinolones.|$|E
25|$|Ofloxacin is a second-generation fluoroquinolone, being a broader-spectrum analog of <b>norfloxacin,</b> and was {{synthesized}} {{and developed}} by scientists at Daiichi Seiyaku.|$|E
25|$|A 1998 {{retrospective}} {{survey found that}} numerous side effects have been recorded {{in reference to the}} unapproved use of <b>norfloxacin</b> in the pediatric population.|$|E
25|$|As noted above, under {{licensed}} use, <b>norfloxacin</b> is {{also now}} {{considered to be}} contraindicated {{for the treatment of}} certain sexually transmitted diseases by some experts due to bacterial resistance.|$|E
25|$|The {{concomitant}} {{administration of}} quinolones including <b>norfloxacin</b> with glyburide (a sulfonylurea agent) has, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia. Therefore, monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when these agents are co-administered.|$|E
25|$|Though the fluoroquinolones are {{sometimes}} {{used to treat}} typhoid and paratyphoid fever, {{it should be noted}} here that <b>norfloxacin</b> had more clinical failures than the other fluoroquinolones (417 participants, 5 trials).|$|E
25|$|Elevated serum {{levels of}} {{cyclosporine}} {{have been reported}} with concomitant use of cyclosporine with <b>norfloxacin.</b> Therefore, cyclosporine serum levels should be monitored and appropriate cyclosporine dosage adjustments made when these drugs are used concomitantly.|$|E
25|$|<b>Norfloxacin</b> is {{used for}} {{prevention}} of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients who have a low ascites fluid protein level, impaired renal function, severe liver disease, have had a prior episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or esophageal variceal bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroquinolones have varying {{specificity}} for cytochrome P450, and so {{may have}} interactions with drugs cleared by those enzymes; the order from most P450-inhibitory to least, is enoxacin > ciprofloxacin > <b>norfloxacin</b> > ofloxacin, levofloxacin, trovafloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Norfloxacin</b> {{has been}} {{restricted}} in the Republic of Ireland {{due to the}} risks of C.difficile super infections and permanent nerve as well as tendon injuries. It licensed use in acute and chronic complicated kidney infections has been withdrawn as a result.|$|E
25|$|<b>Norfloxacin</b> is {{associated}} with a number of rare serious adverse reactions as well as spontaneous tendon ruptures and irreversible peripheral neuropathy. Tendon problems may manifest long after therapy had been completed and in severe cases may result in lifelong disabilities.|$|E
25|$|Kyorin granted Merck & Company, Inc., an {{exclusive}} license (in certain countries, including the United States), to import and distribute <b>Norfloxacin</b> under {{the brand name}} Noroxin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Noroxin for distribution in the United States on October 31, 1986.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of {{overdose}} includes emptying of {{the stomach}} via induced vomiting or by gastric lavage. Careful monitoring and supportive treatment, monitoring of renal and liver function, and maintaining adequate hydration is recommended by the manufacturer. Administration of magnesium, aluminum, or calcium containing antacids can reduce the absorption of <b>norfloxacin.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Norfloxacin</b> is a {{synthetic}} chemotherapeutic antibacterial agent {{that belongs to}} the class of fluoroquinolone antibiotics. It is used to treat urinary tract infections, gynecological infections, inflammation of the prostate gland, gonorrhea and bladder infection. Eye drops were approved for use in children older than one year of age. It is sold under the brand name Noroxin.|$|E
25|$|The {{toxicity}} {{of drugs that}} are metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system is enhanced by concomitant use of some quinolones. Quinolones, including <b>norfloxacin,</b> may enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants, including warfarin or its derivatives or similar agents. When these products are administered concomitantly, prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation tests should be closely monitored. Coadministration may dangerously increase coumadin warfarin activity; INR should be monitored closely.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} the {{substantial}} increase in antibacterial activity of <b>norfloxacin</b> relative to early fluoroquinolones, it did not become a widely used antibiotic. Other companies initiated fluoroquinolone discovery programs {{in the aftermath of}} the publication of the <b>norfloxacin</b> patent. Bayer Pharmaceuticals discovered that the addition of a single carbon atom to the <b>norfloxacin</b> structure provided another 4 to 10-fold improvement in activity. [...] Ciprofloxacin reached the market just one year after <b>norfloxacin</b> and achieved sales of 1.5 billion Euros at its peak.|$|E
2500|$|... "Noroxin (<b>norfloxacin)</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in persons}} {{with a history}} of hypersensitivity, tendinitis, or tendon rupture {{associated with the use of}} <b>norfloxacin</b> or any member of the quinolone group of antimicrobial agents." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “Absorption of <b>norfloxacin</b> is rapid {{following}} single {{doses of}} 200mg, 400mg and 800mg. At the respective doses, mean peak serum and plasma concentrations of 0.8, 1.5 and 2.4 μg/mL are attained approximately one hour after dosing. The effective half-life of <b>norfloxacin</b> in serum and plasma is 3–4 hours. Steady-state concentrations of <b>norfloxacin</b> will be attained {{within two days}} of dosing. [...] Renal excretion occurs by both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion {{as evidenced by the}} high rate of renal clearance (approximately 275 mL/min). Within 24 hours of drug administration, 26 to 32% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine as <b>norfloxacin</b> with an additional 5-8% being recovered in the urine as six active metabolites of lesser antimicrobial potency. Only a small percentage (less than 1%) of the dose is recovered thereafter. Fecal recovery accounts for another 30% of the administered dose. [...] Two to three hours after a single 400-mg dose, urinary concentrations of 200 μg/mL or more are attained in the urine. In healthy volunteers, mean urinary concentrations of <b>norfloxacin</b> remain above 30 μg/mL for at least 12 hours following a 400-mg dose. The urinary pH may affect the solubility of <b>norfloxacin.</b> <b>Norfloxacin</b> is least soluble at urinary pH of 7.5 with greater solubility occurring at pHs above and below this value. The serum protein binding of <b>norfloxacin</b> is between 10 and 15%.” Quoting from the 2009 package insert for Noroxin.|$|E
2500|$|... "Quinolones, {{including}} <b>norfloxacin,</b> {{have been}} shown in vitro to inhibit CYP1A2. Concomitant use with drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g., caffeine, clozapine, ropinirole, tacrine, theophylline, tizanidine) may result in increased substrate drug concentrations when given in usual doses. Patients taking any of these drugs concomitantly with <b>norfloxacin</b> should be carefully monitored." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Norfloxacin</b> is a broad-spectrum {{antibiotic}} that {{is active}} against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. [...] It functions by inhibiting DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase, and topoisomerase IV, enzymes necessary to separate bacterial DNA, thereby inhibiting cell division. <b>Norfloxacin</b> does not bind to DNA gyrase but does bind to the substrate DNA.|$|E
2500|$|Syphilis treatment: <b>Norfloxacin</b> has {{not been}} shown to be {{effective}} in the treatment of syphilis. [...] Antimicrobial agents used in high doses for short periods of time to treat gonorrhea may mask or delay the symptoms of incubating syphilis.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{members of}} the {{quinolone}} antibacterial class were relatively low potency drugs such as nalidixic acid, used mainly {{in the treatment of}} urinary tract infections owing to their renal excretion and propensity to be concentrated in urine. [...] In 1979 the publication of a patent filed by the pharmaceutical arm of Kyorin Seiyaku Kabushiki Kaisha disclosed the discovery of <b>norfloxacin,</b> and the demonstration that certain structural modifications including the attachment of a fluorine atom to the quinolone ring leads to dramatically enhanced antibacterial potency.|$|E
2500|$|Such drug {{interactions}} {{are associated with}} the molecular structural modifications of the quinolone ring, specifically interactions involving NSAIDS and theophylline. [...] As such, these {{drug interactions}} involving the fluoroquinolones appear to be drug specific rather than a class effect. [...] The fluoroquinolones have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of caffeine and the absorption of levothyroxine. The interference with the metabolism of caffeine may lead to the reduced clearance of caffeine and a prolongation of its serum half-life, resulting in a caffeine overdose. [...] This may lead to reduced clearance of caffeine and a prolongation of the plasma's half-life that may lead to accumulation of caffeine in plasma when products containing caffeine are consumed while taking <b>norfloxacin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Competence in S. pneumoniae is {{induced by}} DNA-damaging agents such as {{mitomycin}} C, fluoroquinolone antibiotics (<b>norfloxacin,</b> levofloxacin and moxifloxacin), and topoisomerase inhibitors. Transformation protects S. pneumoniae against the bactericidal effect of mitomycin C. [...] Michod et al. summarized evidence that induction of competence in S. pneumoniae {{is associated with}} increased resistance to oxidative stress and increased expression of the RecA protein, {{a key component of}} the recombinational repair machinery for removing DNA damages. On the basis of these findings they suggested that transformation is an adaptation for repairing oxidative DNA damages. S. pneumoniae infection stimulates polymorphonuclear leukocytes (granulocytes) to produce an oxidative burst that is potentially lethal to the bacteria. The ability of S. pneumoniae to repair the oxidative DNA damages in its genome, caused by this host defense, likely contributes to this pathogen’s virulence. Consistent with this premise Li et al. reported that, among different highly transformable S. pneumoniae isolates, nasal colonization fitness and virulence (lung infectivity) depend on an intact competence system.|$|E
2500|$|Competence is {{specifically}} induced by DNA damaging conditions. [...] For instance, transformation is induced in Streptococcus pneumoniae by the DNA damaging agents mitomycin C (a DNA crosslinking agent) and fluoroquinolone (a topoisomerase inhibitor that causes double-strand breaks). [...] In B. subtilis, transformation is increased by UV light, a DNA damaging agent. In Helicobacter pylori, ciprofloxacin, which interacts with DNA gyrase and introduces double-strand breaks, induces expression of competence genes, thus enhancing {{the frequency of}} transformation Using Legionella pneumophila, Charpentier et al. tested 64 toxic molecules to determine which of these induce competence. [...] Of these only six, all DNA damaging agents, caused strong induction. [...] These DNA damaging agents were mitomycin C (which causes DNA inter-strand crosslinks), <b>norfloxacin,</b> ofloxacin and nalidixic acid (inhibitors of DNA gyrase that cause double-strand breaks), bicyclomycin (causes single- and double-strand breaks), and hydroxyurea (induces DNA base oxidation). [...] UV light also induced competence in L. pneumophila. [...] Charpentier et al. suggested that competence for transformation probably evolved as a DNA damage response.|$|E
2500|$|Laboratory {{identification}} of B. pseudomallei can be difficult, especially in Western countries {{where it is}} rarely seen. [...] The large, wrinkled colonies look like environmental contaminants, so are often discarded as being of no clinical significance. [...] Colony morphology is very variable and a single strain may display [...] multiple colony types, so inexperienced laboratory staff may mistakenly believe the growth is not pure. The organism grows more slowly than other bacteria that may be present in clinical specimens, and in specimens from nonsterile sites, is easily overgrown. [...] Nonsterile specimens should, therefore, be cultured in selective media (e.g., Ashdown's or B. cepacia medium). For heavily contaminated samples, such as faeces, {{a modified version of}} Ashdown's that includes <b>norfloxacin,</b> amoxicillin, and polymyxin B has been proposed. In blood culture, the [...] BacT/ALERT MB system (normally used for culturing mycobacteria) by bioMérieux has been shown to have superior yields compared to conventional blood culture media.|$|E
