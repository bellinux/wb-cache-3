5|$|Mengele {{received}} doctorates {{in anthropology}} and medicine from Munich University {{and began a}} career as a researcher. He joined the Nazi Party in 1937 and the SS in 1938. Initially assigned as a battalion medical officer at the start of World War II, he was transferred to the concentration camp service in early 1943 and assigned to Auschwitz. There he saw the opportunity to conduct genetic research on human subjects. His subsequent experiments, focusing primarily on twins, had <b>no</b> <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> the health or safety of the victims.|$|E
5|$|Mengele used Auschwitz as an {{opportunity}} to continue his anthropological studies and research on heredity, using inmates for human experimentation. The experiments had <b>no</b> <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> the health, safety, or physical and emotional suffering of the victims. He was particularly interested in identical twins, people with heterochromia iridum (eyes of two different colours), dwarfs, and people with physical abnormalities. A grant was provided by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, applied for by von Verschuer, who received regular reports and shipments of specimens from Mengele. The grant was used to build a pathology laboratory attached to Crematorium II at Auschwitz II-Birkenau. Dr. Miklós Nyiszli, a Hungarian Jewish pathologist who arrived in Auschwitz on 29 May 1944, performed dissections and prepared specimens for shipment in this laboratory. Mengele's twin research was in part intended to prove the supremacy of heredity over environment and thus bolster the Nazi premise of the superiority of the Aryan race. Nyiszli and others report that the twins studies may also have been motivated by a desire to improve the reproduction rate of the German race by improving the chances of racially desirable people having twins.|$|E

These palisaded walls formed concentric patterns with <b>no</b> <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> the pre-existing architecture at the site. This village was overrun and itself abandoned {{in the early years}} of the 9th century AD, at which point the history of DosPilas as a settlement ends.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Hardin {{also pointed}} out the problem of {{individuals}} acting in rational self-interest by claiming that if all members in a group used common resources for their own gain and with <b>no</b> <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> others, all resources would still eventually be depleted. Overall, Hardin argued against relying on conscience {{as a means of}} policing commons, suggesting that this favors selfish individuals– often known as free riders– over those who are more altruistic.|$|E

OHV engines began to dominate racing, in spite of Mert Lawwill's efforts to delay the inevitable on his flathead Harleys, and the KR bikes were a decade out of date and could no longer compete.|$|E

40|$|Marxist {{tradition}} has strongly criticized Derrida’s deconstruction approach {{as well as}} the postmodern positions, considering them as only concerned with differences but with <b>no</b> <b>regards</b> <b>for</b> socioeconomic inequality. Nevertheless, an important part of feminism has nursed in such theories to support its own arguments. We analyze the pertinence of such criticism {{as well as the}} particular effects of deconstruction and postmodernism in the theory and praxis of feminism in the light of two current debates. The first one regarding the political potential of deconstruction and postmodernism positions; the second one, referred to the so-called contradiction between socioeconomic redistribution and cultural acknowledgement of the differences. This will lead us to a broader and more comprehensive analysis horizon...|$|R

25|$|Ōkyo's {{painting}} style merged {{a tranquil}} version of Western naturalism with the Eastern decorative {{painting of the}} Kanō school. His works show a Western understanding of highlight and shadow. His realism differed from previous Japanese schools in its devotion to nature as the ultimate source with <b>no</b> <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> sentiment. Ōkyo's intricately detailed plant and animal sketches show a great influence from European nature drawings. An album of leaves in the Nishimura Collection in Kyoto (now in handscroll form) depicts several animals and plants, each labeled as if in European guidebook.|$|E
25|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20th century, {{commercial}} fishing was gaining a foothold in the Aleutian Islands. Packing houses salted cod and herring, and salmon canneries were opened. Another commercial occupation, whaling, continued with <b>no</b> <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> over-hunting. They pushed the bowhead whales to the edge of extinction for the oil in their tissue. The Aleuts soon suffered severe problems due to the depletion of fur seals and sea otters which they needed for survival. As well as requiring the flesh for food, they also used the skins to cover their boats, without which they could not hunt. The Americans also expanded into the Interior and Arctic Alaska, exploiting the furbearers, fish, and other game on which Natives depended.|$|E
25|$|Psychopathy is a {{personality}} disorder which has symptoms expressed {{over a wide}} range of settings. Socially, it expresses extensive callous and manipulative self-serving behaviors with <b>no</b> <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> others, and often is associated with repeated delinquency, crime and violence, but may also present itself in other, maybe even successful social settings. Mentally, impairments in processes related to affect (emotion) and cognition, particularly socially related mental processes, have been found in those with the disorder which suggest that their destructive social behavior is borne from these aberrant mental processes. Developmentally, symptoms of psychopathy have been identified in young children with conduct disorder, and is suggestive of at least a partial constitutional factor that influences its development.|$|E

25|$|Nitiwul {{has made}} the fight against illegal miners, known as galamseyers, one of his main {{objectives}} as Minister of Defence. Illegal operators mine for precious metals {{in various parts of}} Ghana with little or <b>no</b> <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> the environment. Several bodies of water in the country have dried up due to the environmental degradation caused by the mining, and drinking water has been polluted with harmful chemicals such as cyanide. Previous governments had tried and failed to curb the illegal mining {{due to a lack of}} concerted effort. Working with the military high command of the Ghana Armed Forces and the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, Nitiwul helped roll out measures to seize machinery, drive out the miners, and restore degraded lands in the country.|$|E
25|$|At 18:10 local time, Pukanić {{approached}} his Lexus LS 600h L with Niko Franjić, the Nacional director of marketing. According to first news report, a bomb {{placed in the}} trash can next to the car exploded soon after. However, an October 25 special edition of Večernji list dedicated to the bombing put the bomb on a motorcycle parked next to Lexus which then exploded before {{the two men had}} a chance to enter the car. Pukanić was instantly killed by the blast while Franjić remained alive for a few more seconds. Two graphic design students from a nearby school were injured by shrapnel. The incident happened on a parking lot in Palmotićeva Street, near Stara Vlaška Street and Josip Lang Square, only two street blocks east of the main Zagreb square, Ban Jelačić Square. Police immediately blocked the traffic around the site of assassination, causing immense traffic jams all over the city center. A man was seen running away from the explosion down Palmotićeva Street. He was described as being in his early thirties, wearing a baseball cap and running with <b>no</b> <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> traffic.|$|E

They had <b>no</b> personal <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> each other, and no tastes in common, save the taste for tobacco and drink; but finding that they disliked each other less than they disliked their comrades, they were thus drawn into a hollow friendship, as it were, under protest.|$|R

They had made the entire circuit of Borneo, murdering, and plundering, and {{striking}} terror and desolation wherever they went. The scenes enacted by Norse pirates in the tenth century were repeated {{in the middle of}} the nineteenth by a people who, unlike the Norsemen, had <b>no</b> <b>regard</b> whatever <b>for</b> law; and now they were returning home laden with booty.|$|R
40|$|The {{adaptive}} {{immune system}} relies on the diversity of receptors expressed {{on the surface of}} B and T-cells to protect the organism from a vast amount of pathogenic threats. The proliferation and degradation dynamics of different cell types (B cells, T cells, naive, memory) is governed by a variety of antigenic and environmental signals, yet the observed clone sizes follow a universal power law distribution. Guided by this reproducibility we propose effective models of somatic evolution where cell fate depends on an effective fitness. This fitness is determined by growth factors acting either on clones of cells with the same receptor responding to specific antigens, or directly on single cells with <b>no</b> <b>regards</b> <b>for</b> clones. We identify fluctuations in the fitness acting specifically on clones as the essential ingredient leading to the observed distributions. Combining our models with experiments we characterize the scale of fluctuations in antigenic environments and we provide tools to identify the relevant growth signals in different tissues and organisms. Our results generalize to any evolving population in a fluctuating environment...|$|R

Nansen's {{daughter}} Liv recorded that there were no speeches, just music: Schubert's Death and the Maiden, which Eva used to sing. Among the many tributes paid to him subsequently was that of Lord Robert Cecil, a fellow League of Nations delegate, who spoke of the range of Nansen's work, done with <b>no</b> <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> his own interests or health: [...] "Every good cause had his support.

500|$|Gameplay {{mechanics}} were {{singled out}} as being particularly poor. The third-person shooter sections suffered from poor camera-angle management, making targeting enemies feel [...] "awkward and disjointed". Enemy artificial intelligence for these sections was described as predictable and basic, adopting repeated firing stances or ignoring the character despite being shot repeatedly. Sniper variants of this fared better. The vehicle sections were also disappointing, with physics and vehicle handling being rated poorly. Vehicles were described as feeling [...] "slow and clapped out", with pursuits described as being [...] "boring". The use of AI in these sections were heavily criticized for being predictable and simplistic, with enemy vehicles having <b>no</b> <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> their own safety. The puzzle games were also received badly, being described as [...] "15 shades of easy and 20 shades of terrible". Interrogation scenes were, in contrast, well liked, with reviewers finding the dialogue during these scenes entertaining.|$|E

I am glad to report that The Journey Continues is entrenched in beauty, holding up well to its predecessor." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{characters}} {{are present in}} multiple entries of the series, such as Giygas, Mr. Saturn, and Pokey/Porky. Giygas is the primary antagonist in both Mother and EarthBound. The alien creature's emotional complexity deviates from genre norms. Giygas shows internal conflict in Mother and has no appearance but as an [...] "indescribable" [...] force in EarthBound final boss battle. In both final battles, Giygas is defeated through love and prayer instead of through {{a tour de force}} of weaponry, unlike the endings of other period games. Nadia Oxford wrote for IGN that nearly two decades later, EarthBound final fight against Giygas continues to be [...] "one of the most epic video game standoffs of all time" [...] with noted emotional impact. This battle's dialogue was based on Itoi's recollections of a traumatic scene from the Shintoho film The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty that he had accidentally seen in his childhood. Oxford wrote for 1UP.com that Itoi intended to show the alien's yearning for love in [...] "a manner ... beyond human understanding". Despite EarthBound and Mother 3 dissimilar settings, the Mr. Saturn fictional species appear in similar Saturn Valleys in both games. The Mr. Saturn look like an old man's head with feet, a large nose, and bald except for a single hair with a bow. Though they are a technologically advanced and peaceful species with a pureness of heart, they are under constant attacks from encroaching enemies. Nadia and David Oxford of 1UP.com considered the Mr. Saturn to be aliens despite their human-like and fleshy appearance, as described a piece arguing the central theme of aliens in the Mother series. They compared the Mr. Saturn to Kurt Vonnegut's Tralfamadorian alien species. Finally, Pokey begins as Ness's child neighbor who [...] "cowers" [...] and [...] "refuses to fight" [...] in EarthBound, but grows into a [...] "vicious control freak with <b>no</b> <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> human life", Porky, {{by the end of the}} series' Mother 3.|$|E
