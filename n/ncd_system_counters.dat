40|$|Abstract—Network Coordinate (<b>NC)</b> <b>systems</b> {{provide a}} {{lightweight}} and useful way for scalable Internet distance prediction {{while serving as}} an important component in many Peerto-Peer applications. Most of the existing <b>NC</b> <b>systems</b> utilize the Euclidean distance model, which is largely impaired by the persistent occurrence of Triangle Inequality Violation (TIV) in the Internet. Recently, matrix factorization (MF) based <b>NC</b> <b>systems,</b> which can completely remove the TIV constraint, provide an alternative approach towards better prediction accuracy. Phoenix, an <b>NC</b> <b>system</b> based on the MF model, well explores {{the advantage of the}} MF model and becomes the most accurate <b>NC</b> <b>system</b> so far. However, through experimental study, we find that the prediction accuracy of Phoenix for short links is significantly worse compared with the overall prediction accuracy. Based on the observation, we propose a new <b>NC</b> <b>system,</b> named Pancake, aiming at reducing the high prediction error for short links. By introducing a two-level architecture, Pancake achieves much higher prediction accuracy than other selected existing <b>NC</b> <b>systems.</b> Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Pancake reduces the 90 th percentile relative error by up to 25. 37 % from Phoenix. Moreover, Pancake converges very fast and is robust to different dimension values. For further insights, we study the performance of Pancake using a dynamic data set in addition to the widely used aggregate data sets. With varying RTTs over time, Pancake outperforms other <b>NC</b> <b>systems</b> consistently. I...|$|R

Most existing <b>NC</b> <b>systems</b> embed hosts into a low dimensional Euclidean space. Unfortunately, the persistent occurrence of Triangle Inequality Violation (TIV) on the Internet largely limits the distance prediction accuracy of those <b>NC</b> <b>systems.</b> Some alternative systems aim at handling the persistent TIV, however, they only achieve comparable prediction accuracy with Euclidean distance based <b>NC</b> <b>systems.</b> In this paper, we propose an <b>NC</b> <b>system,</b> so-called Phoenix, {{which is based}} on the matrix factorization model.

The weightbased mechanism can substantially reduce the impact of the error propagation. Using the representative aggregate data sets and the newly measured dynamic data set collected from the Internet, our simulations show that Phoenix achieves significantly higher prediction accuracy than other <b>NC</b> <b>systems.</b> We also show that Phoenix quickly converges to steady state, performs well under host churn, handles the drift of the NCs successfully by using regularization, and is robust against measurement anomalies.

40|$|Abstract—While network {{coordinate}} (<b>NC)</b> <b>systems</b> provide scalable Internet distance estimation {{service and}} {{are useful for}} various Internet applications, decentralized, matrix factorization-based <b>NC</b> (MFNC) <b>systems</b> have received particular attention recently. They can serve large-scale distributed applications (as opposed to centralized <b>NC</b> <b>systems)</b> and {{do not need to}} assume triangle inequality (as opposed to Euclideanbased <b>NC</b> <b>systems).</b> However, because of their decentralized nature, MFNC systems are vulnerable to various malicious attacks. In this paper, we provide the first study on attacks toward MFNC systems, and propose a decentralized trust and reputation approach, called NCShield, to counter such attacks. Different from previous approaches, our approach is able to distinguish between legitimate distance variations and malicious distance alterations. Using four representative data sets from the Internet, we show that NCShield can defend against attacks with high accuracy. For example, when selecting node pairs with a shorter distance than a predefined threshold in an online game scenario, even if 30 % nodes are malicious, NCShield can reduce the false positive rate from 45. 5 % to 3. 7 %.

40|$|Abstract—Network Coordinate (<b>NC)</b> <b>systems</b> {{provide an}} effi-cient and {{scalable}} mechanism to estimate latencies among hosts. However, many popular algorithms like Vivaldi suffer greatly from {{the existence of}} Triangle Inequality Violations (TIVs). Two-layer systems like Pharos and hierarchical Vivaldi have been proposed to remedy the impact of TIVs. They divide the whole space into several location-based clusters and run <b>NC</b> <b>systems</b> on both global layer and local layer. However, the two-layer model is only able to optimize the intra-cluster links relating to a limited portion of TIV triangles. In this paper, we propose a new <b>NC</b> <b>system,</b> Tarantula, which divides the space in a novel way. By categorizing the TIVs into three classes, we show that Tarantula handles a much larger portion of existing TIVs than two-layer systems. Moreover, we present two techniques to further strengthen the Tarantula system: 1) relate the updating step size in the Vivaldi algorithm used in Tarantula to ground-truth latency so as to improve the prediction for short links; 2) propose Dynamic Cluster Optimization to dynamically adjust clustering of hosts. Our experimental results show that Tarantula outperforms Pharos and Vivaldi significantly in terms of estimation accuracy. When implementing different <b>NC</b> <b>systems</b> {{in the application of}} server selection and detour finding, Tarantula again performs the best. I...|$|R
