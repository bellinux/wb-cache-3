50|$|Since the 1980s, {{there have}} been {{constant}} {{plans to build a}} <b>new</b> <b>service</b> <b>station</b> on the motorway south of Birmingham Airport and the NEC, but this has yet to be built.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{developments}} {{between the}} village {{and the town of}} Shrewsbury have almost merged the two settlements. Upon the recent completion of the <b>new</b> <b>service</b> <b>station</b> and livestock market site at the Battlefield Roundabout, there is only a small field separating the town and Upper Battlefield.|$|E
50|$|The village became {{prominent}} in the 1970s as {{the location of a}} <b>new</b> <b>service</b> <b>station</b> on the A38 Devon Expressway between Exeter and Plymouth, near the southern terminus of the then new M5 motorway. This service area is a popular stopping place for tourists on their way to South Devon and Cornwall.|$|E
50|$|Following the re-branding {{and after}} adding five <b>new</b> <b>service</b> <b>stations,</b> the market share for petrol held by Z Energy slipped from 31.6% in 2011 to 29.0% in 2013.|$|R
50|$|Infratil and New Zealand Super {{retained}} a combined stake of 40% in Z Energy. Z Energy is forecasting sales {{to fall to}} 2,476 million litres in 2013-14. This is 7% less than the volume in 2010-11 after addition of the five <b>new</b> <b>service</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R
30|$|Within {{the next}} decade a wider {{diffusion}} of biomethane supply points is expected, since the EU Directive {{for the development of}} energy infrastructures and alternative fuels has established that an appropriate number of methane plants, according to the increasing demand, will have to be built in urban and extra-urban nodes by 2025. Lombardy has imposed the presence of methane pumps in <b>new</b> <b>service</b> <b>stations</b> (regional law 24 / 2006), providing a discrete diffusion of refueling points. Producing biomethane by using part or all of the organic solid urban waste, would allow to produce pumps for fueling vehicles for waste collection.|$|R
50|$|Local {{residents}} {{fear that}} the <b>new</b> <b>service</b> <b>station</b> could bring traffic problems to the area, due {{to the design of}} the service station, which is located directly off a junction, rather than the traditional method of locating services between junctions. Traffic leaving the service area to return to the motorway must cross the A355.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>new</b> <b>service</b> <b>station</b> {{uses the}} latest 'green technologies' in its {{construction}} and running, {{making it the}} UK's first carbon neutral service station. [...] The service station will include a 126-bed Days Inn hotel, {{which will be the}} first major hotel in the north of the town. The service station will actually fall into North Yorkshire and so technically be under separate jurisdiction to Wetherby. The services opened (except for the hotel) in August 2008, with the hotel opening the following summer.|$|E
50|$|Foster {{was born}} April 25, 1893 in St. Joseph, Missouri. In 1924, at age 31, {{he set up}} a {{low-power}} AM radio station with his partner, Jerry Hall, in a corner of their Firestone dealership, Foster-Hall Tire Co., in St. Joseph. It began as a hobby, but as local businesses increasingly sought to advertise on the station, it became a full-time occupation. He increased its power and on June 30, 1926, it was licensed as KGBX on 1040 kHz. Foster built a <b>new</b> <b>service</b> <b>station</b> and glassed-in studios for the radio station a few blocks north. A singer himself, he and Hall performed on the station as The Radio Rubber Twins.|$|E
5000|$|Matson {{police station}} was closed in 1994 [...] In 2009 plans were {{revealed}} {{for the construction}} of a <b>new</b> motorway <b>service</b> <b>station.</b> Following the planning process and a judicial review Gloucester services was built near Matson with the northbound services opening on May 7, 2014 and the southbound services due to open in May 2015.|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the factors}} that helped the {{development}} gain planning permission was the inclusion of a green roof in the design. The 4000sqm state-of-the-art green roof was designed to disguise the <b>new</b> <b>service</b> <b>station</b> as part of the landscape. With the Cotswolds on one side and Robinswood Hill on the other, every effort had to be made to reduce the aesthetic and biological impact the project had. A bespoke seed mix was used which was intended to mimic the natural vegetation of the surrounding landscape. Species such as birdsfoot trefoil and yellow rattle were included to attract UK native pollinators such as bees and butterflies.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, it was {{announced}} that Hobart Airport would receive more upgrades, including a first floor, aerobridges (currently, passengers must walk on the tarmac) and shopping facilities. Possible new international flights to Asia and New Zealand, and possible new domestic flights to Darwin, Cairns and Perth have been proposed. A second runway, possibly to be constructed in the next 15 years, would assist with growing passenger numbers to Hobart. Hobart Control Tower may be renovated and fitted with new radar equipment, and the airport's carpark may be extended further. Also, new facilities will be built just outside the airport. A <b>new</b> <b>service</b> <b>station,</b> hotel and day care centre have already been built and the road leading to the airport has been maintained and re-sealed. In addition, Tony Abbott the former Prime minister of Australia promised in the lead up to the 2013 federal election that his government would provide the funding needed for an extension of the one and only runway at Hobart international. This would allow larger planes to land which could boost the economy.|$|E
5000|$|In 1964, Texaco {{introduced}} the [...] "Matawan" [...] service station design at a station in Matawan, New Jersey. Two years later, Texaco replaced the long-running banjo sign {{with a new}} hexagon logo {{that had previously been}} test-marketed with the [...] "Matawan" [...] station design introduced two years earlier. The new logo featured a red outline with TEXACO in black bold lettering and a small banjo logo with a red star and green T at bottom. The following year, the Regent name was replaced by Texaco at British petrol stations. In 1970, in response to increasingly stringent federal emission standards that would ultimately lead to the mandating of unleaded gasoline in 1975 and later-model cars and trucks, Texaco introduced lead-free Texaco as the first regular-octane lead-free gasoline at stations in the Los Angeles area and throughout Southern California. Lead-free Texaco became available nationwide in 1974. On November 20, 1980, the Lake Peigneur/Jefferson Island disaster occurred. Two years later, a <b>new</b> <b>service</b> <b>station</b> design was introduced. Several product names were also changed with the advent of self-service including Lead-free Texaco to Texaco Unleaded, Fire Chief to Texaco Regular, and Super Lead-free Sky Chief to Texaco Super Unleaded.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} diploma {{thesis is}} to create a {{proposal}} of a <b>new</b> car <b>service</b> <b>station</b> in a <b>new</b> lokality with regard to acquired experiences of the company.

Together with that, it contains an economic research and put forward a strategy for the <b>service</b> <b>station</b> construction. The next, technical part, consists of the <b>service</b> <b>station</b> proposal with regard to outcomesin preceeding parts. Last part suggests an ekonomice valuation of the project...|$|R
50|$|In June 2016, Total SA {{acquired}} the {{assets and liabilities}} of Gapco Limited, a petroleum products company that was operating in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Following that transaction, Total M&S Uganda acquired 37 <b>new</b> fuel <b>service</b> <b>stations,</b> bringing {{the total number of}} fuel stations it operates in the country to 162, the highest owned by any fuel marketing and distribution company in the country.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, the Kenyan {{government}} {{opened a}} <b>new</b> metro rail <b>service</b> <b>station</b> to the suburb of Syokimau. Syokimau will get several trains every day {{although there was}} criticism that a ticket would cost {{more than the average}} daily wage.|$|R
50|$|Wallace David “Happy” Williford, {{a senior}} at Jacksonville High School in Jacksonville, Arkansas, and {{employee}} at another Pierce-owned station in Jacksonville, {{was asked by the}} company to come operate the <b>new</b> <b>service</b> <b>station.</b> Williford agreed and worked at the station before and after attending school. Williford paid men to operate the station for him during school hours, but says it was hard finding men who would only work for $3.50 a week. For rent, Pierce charged Williford two cents per gallon of gas sold. At first, the station had no electric gas pumps, and Williford and his employees had to hand pump the gas up into the glass bowl before filling each car's tank. Around 1940, the Roundtop became a Sinclair station, after Pierce Oil was purchased by the Sinclair Oil Company. Around this time, electric pumps were installed Some time in the early 1950s, Sinclair sold many of their Arkansas stations, including the Roundtop, to the Phillips Petroleum Company, and the station became a Phillips 66 branded station. In the 1970s, the station would become a DX branded station, and at the time it closed in 1981, it was a Sunoco branded station due to Sun Oil Company’s acquisition of DX. By 1957, Williford had saved up enough money to purchase the station for $8,000. With business booming, Willford would open up another gas station {{at the foot of the}} Broadway Bridge in North Little Rock (Pulaski County), near the site of present day Dickey-Stephens Park. Williford later closed that station and opened another at 914 East Broadway in North Little Rock. During this time, Williford leased the Roundtop to others. He returned to the Roundtop in the mid-1970s and operated it exclusively until he retired and closed the business in 1981. In 1989, Wayne Ball, a local auctioneer, coincidentally, a former station employee from his youth, conducted the auction of the Roundtop on behalf of Williford. The winning bidder was George E. Brown, a North Little Rock businessman. Brown planned to renovate the then dilapidated building; however before this could happen, Brown died, and, in 1999, his heirs donated the station to the City of Sherwood, which had annexed the area in 1975.|$|E
