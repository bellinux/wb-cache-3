40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Merging {{isothermal}} buoyant jets in a crossflow {{were investigated}} experimentally. Jets of salt water were discharged from a constant head tank into the stagnant tap water. A crossflow was simulated by towing the discharge ports through the receiving water at desired speeds. Visualization {{of the jet}} cross-sections produced by a vertical slit light source and fluorescein dye was recorded as a sequence of pictures taken by a motor-driven camera. Maximum heights, widths, and vertical cross-sections of deflected buoyant jets for different velocity ratios, number of nozzles and <b>nozzle</b> <b>line</b> orientation were plotted against downstream location. Horseshoe shaped cross section was observed and recorded {{in the case of}} single jet in crossflow and multiple jet crossflow parallel to <b>nozzle</b> <b>line,</b> while in the case of crossflow perpendicular to <b>nozzle</b> <b>line</b> horseshoe pattern was not clear. Wake behind the multiple jets in crossflow was observed and recorded, with distinct vortex street behind. Experimental results show that single jets dilute more rapidly so the cross-sections are larger and trajectories lower. Increasing velocity ratio for fixed N and θ₁ lowers the trajectories and reduces plume widths and normalized cross-sectional area; all of them appear to increase linearly with x (from x= 10 D on). Increasing number of ports for fixed R and θ₁ raises the trajectories and reduces normalized cross-sectional areas rapidly. Changing the angle θ₁ between crossflow and line connecting the ports for fixed R and N strongly influences cross-sections. At θ₁ = 0 ⁰ vortex pair is dominant and normalized areas are the largest. At θ₁ = 45 ° jets are rolled in space like a band and vortex pair can be seen. At 90 ° vortex appears only at the lowest velocity ratio R = 0. 1...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{examines}} line {{measurements of}} pressure, temperature, and density in high speed, non-isobaric flows emanating from an underexpanded jet <b>nozzle.</b> <b>Line</b> images of rotational and vibrational Raman spectra are collected for a 8 -mm linear laser probe, and are combined onto the same EMCCD detector. Combining the two techniques {{allows for a}} single-shot measurement of major species, pressure, and temperature in a turbulent non-isobaric environment that is chemically reacting. Temperature measurements along the laser test section are extracted from the rotational Raman spectrum, whereas major species densities are measured by examining the intensities of their respective vibrational Raman lines. Pressure can be calculated using an equation of state, in every location along the linear laser probe. The technique feasibility is examined by performing measurements of pressure, temperature and density in a non-reacting underexpanded air jet where the chemical composition is constant and known.

The aim of plant protection is to apply plant protection products (PPP) according to the site specific requirements on the field. Within {{the context of a}} research program to promote innovation, a sprayer with direct injection of plant protection products was developed. The direct injection offers site specific spraying of different individual PPP in a single pass. The sprayer prototype is equipped with a special spray boom combining three <b>nozzle</b> <b>lines.</b> In order to prevent delay times, the <b>nozzle</b> <b>lines</b> are preloaded before spraying. First results for weed control from test stand measurements and field trials showed that the injection pumps work with high accuracy. The prototype can be used without delay times site specific with up to three different herbicides. Field trials for site-specific weed control in winter wheat demonstrate the applicability of the system under practical conditions. By treatment of subareas herbicides and therefore costs could be saved. A reduction in yield compared with the conventionally treated field areas could not be ascertained. Also an efficacy reduction through washout of active ingredient from target surfaces due to simultaneous use of all three <b>nozzle</b> <b>lines</b> with up to 1050 l/ha application rate could not be detected. At high water spray rates, the efficacy effect occurs delayed. Overall, the newly developed direct injection system proved fieldabillity during the first tests. So weed control can be carried out situation-responsive, which can save herbicides and environmental impacts are reduced...|$|R

This design, pioneered {{in the former}} Soviet Union, features inner and outer skins brazed to middle separators, forming cooling channels.

The investigation was conducted at a free-stream Mach number of 2. 0 and a Reynolds number per foot of 14. 4 x 10 (exp 6). An axially symmetric sonic nozzle and two supersonic nozzles were employed for the jets. The supersonic nozzles consisted of an axially symmetric nozzle with exit Mach number of 3. 44 and a two-dimensional nozzle with exit Mach number of 1. 76. The ratio of nozzle total pressure to free-stream static pressure was varied from 20 to 110. Negative loads were induced on the flat-plate wing by all the jets.

50|$|The AS-20 {{had four}} steeply swept-back fins, {{cruciform}} in cross-section around the midsection of its body. It used a dual-thrust solid rocket motor, which exhausted through two large nozzles during the boost stage, {{and a single}} center <b>line</b> <b>nozzle</b> during the sustain stage. The AS-20 uses a simple MCLOS guidance with the pilot aligning the flares on the missile's rear with the target and controlling the missile in flight after launch with a small joystick sending steering command's to the missile via a radio link. The steering command's steer the missile back to the line-of-sight by thrust vectoring by the movement of one of four metal vanes around the center sustainer nozzle. The missile's internal gyro gives the missile command unit, the correct position of the missile in flight, and to which of the four thrust vanes to actuate at the correct time.|$|R
40|$|A {{model scale}} flight effects test was {{conducted}} in the 40 by 80 foot wind tunnel to investigate the effect of aircraft forward speed on single flow jet noise characteristics. The models tested included a 15. 24 cm baseline round convergent nozzle, a 20 -lobe and annular nozzle with and without lined ejector shroud, and a 57 -tube <b>nozzle</b> with a <b>lined</b> ejector shroud. <b>Nozzle</b> operating conditions covered jet velocities from 412 to 640 m/s at a total temperature of 844 K. Wind tunnel speeds were varied from near zero to 91. 5 m/s. Measurements were analyzed to (1) determine apparent jet noise source location including effects of ambient velocity; (2) verify a technique for extrapolating near field jet noise measurements into the far field; (3) determine flight effects in the near and far field for baseline and suppressor nozzles; and (4) establish the wind tunnel {{as a means of}} accurately defining flight effects for model nozzles and full scale engines...|$|R
