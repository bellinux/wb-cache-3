50|$|Both Chechen and Ingush {{traditional}} music {{could be very}} much defined by their tradition of vocal polyphony. As in other North Caucasian musical cultures, Chechen and Ingush polyphony {{is based on a}} drone. Unlike most of the other North Caucasian polyphonic traditions (where two-part polyphony is the leading type), Chechen and Ingush polyphony is mostly three-part. Middle part, the carrier of the main melody of songs, is accompanied by the double drone, holding the interval of the fifth “around” the main melody. Intervals and chords, used in Chechen and Ingush polyphony, are often dissonances (sevenths, seconds, fourths). This is quite usual in all North Caucasian traditions of polyphony as well, but in Chechen and Ingush traditional songs more sharp dissonances are used. In particular, a specific cadence, where the final chord is a dissonant three-part chord, consisting of fourth and the second on top (c-f-g), is quite unique for <b>North</b> <b>Caucasia.</b> Only {{on the other side of}} Caucasian mountains, in westernGeorgia, there are only few songs that finish on the same dissonant chord (c-f-g).|$|E

The fear {{of being}} left alone against Russia {{in an environment of}} confronting blocs was the main factor behind the decision of the Ottoman government to enter the First World War {{on the side of the}} Central Powers. The liberation of the Muslims of Russia from the Russian yoke henceforth became one of the important war objectives of the Ottoman Supreme Command. Nevertheless, the tragic defeat of the Ottoman army in Sankarru did not only constitute a serious obstacle against the realization of these aspirations, but it also helped the Russian army to penetrate deep into Ottoman territory. The outbreak of the revolution in Russia and the Bolshevik power seizure in October 1917 provided the Ottoman government with the opportunity of compensating war losses and realizing the strategic aims embodied on the eve and at the beginning of the Great War. The Ottoman government's policy with regard to Russia between 1917 - 1918 can be analyzed under two main stages. In the short-run the primary aim was the restoration of the pre-war frontier with Russia and acquisition of as much territory in Transcaucasia as possible. With the Russian Treaty of BrestLitovsk, the Ottoman government successfully accomplished its plans with regard to Transcaucasia. In the long-run Ottoman leaders aimed at separating Transcaucasia from Russia in order to create therein independent states that would prevent Russian aggression in the future. In spite of the peace treaty with the Bolsheviks, the Ottoman army continued its military operations in the region. The Ottoman government did everything in its power, militarily or politically, to persuade the Transcaucasian peoples to proclaim their independence. As time went on, Ottomans were not only satisfied with Transcaucasia and <b>North</b> <b>Caucasia</b> was made part of these strategic aims. There were even plans concerning the independence of the Muslims of the Volga basin and Turkestan. Consequently, the primary subject of the relations between the Ottoman and Bolshevik governments in the final two years of the war was the Ottoman activities with regard to the Caucasus region and the Muslims of Russia. These Ottoman objectives not only caused disagreements with the Bolsheviks, but also became a serious source of contention with Germany. Oğuz, C CemM. S...|$|E
40|$|Human {{communities}} have remained {{under the influence}} of geographical factors until recently. Besides this, a human community is not such a being which accept the geographical factors as they are and remain indifferent to such conditions as plant and animal communities do, but is a living creature which attempts to change, to challenge against them. There is a geographical location on which every civilization that has experienced historical events is established. The most important role in spread and expansion, ordissipation and destruction of a civilization is assumed by the natural conditions of the time. A political formation established on a geographical territory that is extremely rich of favorable climate conditions, fertile soils and water resources will undoubtedly develop. History has three never changing main elements. Place (location) time and human. Historical events cannot be clearly explained without any one of them. In order to {{have a better understanding of}} the history, not only the geography on which human communities live, but also how the geographical factors influence the lives of people living on a location should be known. Hence, what the history requires is not an absolute knowledge of geography. On the contrary, what the history requires is the influence of the soil, waters and seas of that location on the people living on it. Human is a living creature using and dominating the natural resources, recognizing their boundaries, and adapting to several things which he cannot overcome. Geographical factors have positively or negatively influenced human communities and political, economical, religious and cultural lives of such communities, and are continuing to influence albeit not as intense as formerly. Each human community occupies a place on the world. In other words, all the human {{communities have}} geographical location. Geographical location influences the material lives of the human communities living on it in different ways. For instance, lives of the people settled on seaside and of people settled on flatlands, lives of people settled along rivers and of people settled on moorlands are different from each other. In this case, historical events should be tried to be explained within the framework of the influences of geographical locations on which communities live on the communities Throughout the history, one of the most important elements in choice of a geography as a settlement area by people has been closeness to water resources. Moreover, many kingdoms established in Anatolia have chosen the geographies where water resources are located as settlement area. For instance, while the Hittite State, which has dominated Anatolia since the mid-IInd millennium B. C., settled on the region comprising Kızılırmak, the Phrygians, which became a strong kingdom in the first quarter of Ist millennium BC, settled on the Sakarya basin, and the Urartian Kindom, which emerged between the 9 th- 6 th centuries BC, settled on the region between Van and Urmiye lakes. Among the said kingdoms, the Hittites and Phrygians found the water resources areas in Middle Anatolia, and the Urartians found the water resources areas in East Anatolia suitable for themselves. This was the case for the villages just as was for kingdoms and cities. First villages were concentrated on a junction point, along shores of a river, on cross points of rivers, or nearby a resource. Water resources have both influenced the spread areas of the kingdoms established in Anatolia and been influential on the political events that have taken place between the kingdoms. As it is known, the concept of political boundary is not applicable in the Ancient Age history. Instead, the geography has been identified as boundary. Thus, at the end of the war that took place inthe Ancient Age between Med and Lydian Kingdoms in 585 B. C., Kızılırmak emerges as the boundary separating the two states from each other. Furthermore, Aras and Dicle Rivers, which are among the most important water resources of Anatolia, still serve as a boundary. Besides all these, according to the Ancient Age literature, the fact that human communities which settle on a region give theirnames to the geography they settle on is a known method. Almost all of the water resources located in Anatolia have been calledwith such names that are different from those used in the Ancient Age. Among these which are covered by this study, Kızılırmak has been called with the names Marasantiya and Halys, Sakarya has been called with the name Sangarios, Aras has been called with the name Araxes, Fırat and Dicle rivers have been called with their Sumerian and Akkadiannames as well as such names as Euphrates and Tigris. Anatolia, which has had the most important natural resources and located at the junction point of the world since the most ancient ages, has always been attention-attractive with its many regions and differentgeographical characteristics isolated from each other with mountain ranges. In virtually every age of the history, it has been split into neighborhoods having various cultural characteristics. These have over time turned into regions bearing different geographical names, where different ethnical groupslive. It is very usual that people living in Anatolia have given several names to the localities they lived on. Some of these names have disappeared, whereas some have not changed although others have settled on that region. Besides this, the geography of Anatolia show great variation in terms of elevation, climate, water resources and strategy. Middle and East Anatolia Regions, which are subject of this study, which have extremely rich history and natural resources, constitute a central region located between Mediterranean and Mesopotamia on the south, Iran on the east, Black Sea on the <b>north,</b> <b>Caucasia</b> on the north-east, and Aegean Sea on the west by their geographical locations. Hence, this region is a junctionpoint of the ancient civilizations which have shined and faded thousands of years ago. East Anatolia’s high flatlands and Middle Anatolia’s moorlands had all the favorable features to meet needs of the people who have lived in the prehistoric ages. They had attracted people with plentitude of the water resources, presence of natural shelters, meadow and forest areas and particularlyplentifulness of hunt animals. Today, although Middle and East Anatolia Regions exhibit a semi-naked appearance, it is very likely that they were such regions covered by dense forests and winter-resistant forests along the creeks and brooks flowing curved within the basins in prehistoric ages. Both Middle Anatolia region and East Anatolia region are on such locations which could be considered adequate in terms of water resources. Most important water resources of Middle Anatolia are Kızılırmak and Sakarya rivers, and their branches, Delice and Porsuk creeks. Most important water resources of Middle Anatolia Region are Aras, Fırat and Dicle rivers, and their branches, Kura, Karasu, Murat and Habur. The water resources called with these names nowadays have influenced either settlement potential or settlement density of Middle and East Anatolia for both prehistoric and historical ages. Prehistoric cave drawings in East Anatolia Region and accommodation places in Middle Anatoliaare very important in terms of enlightening the prehistoric ages of both Anatolia and neighbor countries. When reviewed the archeological map of both Middle Anatolia region and East Anatolia region, a dense settlement is encountered in prehistoric ages, particularly in the Bronze Age. Number of written documents on to the prehistoric ages of Middle and East Anatolia has increased since the mid-IInd millennium B. C., and are increasing day by day. While in these ages the most importantpolitical formation in Middle Anatolia was the Hittite State, which had chosen the curve of Kızılırmak as central territory for itself, a number of Hurri states are mentioned about for East Anatolia. It has now been understood that the central region of the Hurrians was the Van Lake field. We encounter the Hittites and Phrygians,who have chosen for themselves the area where water resources existed, Kızılırmak and Sakarya basins, in the early Ist millennium B. C. in Middle Anatolia, and the Urartian State, which has settled on the region occupied by the Hurris and established a strong kingdom in East Anatolia. Just like for the villages and cities, one of the most important requirements for the states to be able to survive is water resources. While not the most important, the trouble suffered in the water resources and the accompanying drought are remarkable among the reasons that have been influential in collapse of the Hittites. Water resources, in another words, running water network, is of utmost importance today as was in the past. Particulars of water resources in many aspects from their names to their importance in the Ancient Age, from their roles in the events that have taken place between the kingdoms to their records encountered in ancient will be addressed in this study...|$|E
