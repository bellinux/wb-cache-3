5|$|In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway {{was taken}} into public {{ownership}} to become the Metropolitan line of the London Passenger Transport Board's London Underground, including Quainton Road. The LPTB aimed {{to move away from}} freight operations, and saw <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which the rural parts of the MR could be made into viable passenger routes. In 1935 the Brill Tramway was closed. From 1936 Underground trains were withdrawn north of Aylesbury, leaving the London and North Eastern Railway (successor to the GCR) as the only operator using the station, although Underground services were restored for a short period in the 1940s. In 1963 stopping passenger services were withdrawn but fast passenger trains continued to pass through. In 1966 the line was closed to passenger traffic and local goods trains ceased using the station. The line through the station was singled and used by occasional freight trains only.|$|E

To remedy the problem, Michael leaves work early for a late night job as a telemarketer until 1 a.m. When Ryan finds out, he forces Michael to quit, who then fears that there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which he can support Jan and himself. He hops a train to run away, but Jan meets him and tells him that they can work together {{to find a way}} to live. Meanwhile, Dwight pines over Angela, who is later asked out by Andy. After a pep-talk by Jim, Dwight returns as his normal annoying self, to Jim's pleasure. Pam and Jim visit Dwight's family farm, which he has fashioned into a bed and breakfast.|$|E

25|$|Rank {{and status}} are fixed from birth. There is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> Tongan society {{to climb up}} in rank. A low ranking chief will always remain the lesser of a high ranking chief, even though his lands may be bigger and richer and so forth. But he can try to marry a high ranking woman, for {{instance}} if she is interested in his rich lands, and so increase the rank of his children. Status on the other hand, although usually fixed too, can have some vertical movement. The second son of a noble, normally not in line for his father's title, may get it after all if his older brother dies prematurely. In addition to this sometimes, but very rarely, the king may elevate some person to high status.|$|E

500|$|In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway, which leased the line, {{was taken}} into public {{ownership}} and became the Metropolitan line of London Transport. Despite being a small rural station [...] by train from the City of London, Wotton became a station on the London Underground. Frank Pick, the Chief Executive of the London Passenger Transport Board, aimed to abandon freight operations on the London Underground network, and saw <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which the more distant parts of the former Metropolitan Railway could ever become viable passenger routes. As a result, all passenger services north of Aylesbury were withdrawn between 1935 and 1936; the last trains on the Brill Tramway ran on 30November 1935. The line then reverted to {{the descendants of the}} Duke of Buckingham, but having no funds and no rolling stock they were unable to operate it. On 2April 1936, the line's entire infrastructure, including Wotton station, was sold for scrap at auction. Except for a small building which once housed the Brill Tramway's forge, all the station buildings at Wotton have been demolished.|$|E

In an interview with Hot 93.7 radio, Minaj spoke about the leak of the song, saying [...] "That was a leak and I was so upset they put it out 'cause I recorded that song like two years ago.

500|$|Reiss {{concluded}} that Sexual Preference [...] "has value for suggesting directions and the likely worth of ideas", but that given its shortcomings there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which its authors could definitively resolve the issues they explored, despite {{their claim to}} [...] "once and for all" [...] discredit some theoretical ideas about homosexuality. Reiss wrote that Bell et al. asked questions that were [...] "vague" [...] and [...] "open-ended", had an [...] "arbitrary and rigid conception" [...] {{of what could be}} done with their data and lacked [...] "theoretical development" [...] in its handling, and deliberately minimized the importance of the predictor variables they used to test psychoanalytic and other theories. He found their conclusion that sexual orientation has a biological basis unconvincing. DeLamater wrote that Sexual Preference benefited from Bell et al.′s [...] "eclectic theoretical basis", which drew from the psychodynamic model, social learning theory, sociological models that emphasize the importance of peer relationships, and labeling theory. However, while he accepted Bell et al.′s claim that their study was methodologically superior to prior work on homosexuals, he still found it problematic for many reasons and hesitated to endorse its conclusions. In his view, the path analysis involved [...] "arbitrary classification and sequencing of variables".|$|E

It was also used in the soundtracks for the films Tank Girl and National Lampoon's Senior Trip that same year. The song's success ultimately helped Big Choice to sell over 100,000 copies.
