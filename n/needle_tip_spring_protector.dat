This work presents the real-time three-dimensional tracking of flexible needles during insertion into a soft-tissue simulant using a two-dimensional ultrasound transducer. The transducer is placed perpendicular to the <b>needle</b> <b>tip</b> to measure its position. During insertion the transducer is robotically repositioned to track the <b>needle</b> <b>tip.</b> Positioning of the transducer is accomplished via an estimator, that uses the needle insertion velocity corrected by <b>needle</b> <b>tip</b> velocities to estimate out-of-plane motion. Experiments are performed to validate the <b>needle</b> <b>tip</b> pose during tracking.

40|$|Shigella flexneri {{contact with}} enterocytes induces {{a burst of}} protein {{secretion}} via its type III secretion apparatus (TTSA) as an initial step in cellular invasion. We have previously reported that IpaD is positioned at the TTSA <b>needle</b> <b>tip</b> (M. Espina et al., Infect. Immuno. 74 : 4391 - 4400, 2006). From this position, IpaD senses small molecules in the environment to control the presentation of IpaB to the <b>needle</b> <b>tip.</b> This step occurs without type III secretion induction or IpaC recruitment to the S. flexneri surface. IpaC is then transported to the S. flexneri surface when target cell lipids are added, and this event presumably mimics host cell contact. Unlike IpaB mobilization, IpaC surface presentation is closely linked to secretion induction. This study demonstrates that sphingomyelin and cholesterol are key players in type III secretion induction and that they appear to interact with IpaB to elicit IpaC presentation at the TTSA <b>needle</b> <b>tip.</b> Furthermore, IpaB localization at the <b>needle</b> <b>tip</b> prior to membrane contact provides the optimal set of conditions for host cell invasion. Thus, the S. flexneri type III secretion system can be induced in a stepwise manner, with the first step being the stable association of IpaD with the <b>needle</b> <b>tip,</b> the second step being the sensing of small molecules by IpaD to mobilize IpaB to the tip, and the third step being the interaction of lipids with IpaB to induce IpaC localization at the <b>needle</b> <b>tip</b> concomitant with translocon insertion into the host membrane and type III secretion induction...|$|R

40|$|<b>Needle</b> <b>tip</b> {{visualization}} is of high {{importance in}} {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) guided interventional procedures, for example for taking biopsies from suspicious lesions in the liver or kidney.

The authors investigated two special biopsy <b>needle</b> <b>tip</b> designs using diamagnetic coatings. For common interventional MR sequences, the <b>needle</b> <b>tip</b> can be identified in the MR image by several equidistant dark spots arranged along a straight line. A dotted instead of a solid line allows for an improved control of {{the movement of the}} needle, not only if the needle is tilted toward the imaging plane, but also if the needle leaves an empty canal with signal extinction, which cannot be distinguished from the needle material itself. With the proposed design the position of the <b>needle</b> <b>tip</b> can be estimated with a precision of approximately 1 mm using conventional FLASH, FISP, and TSE sequences, as use d for interventional MR.

The core of this thesis is motivated by image-guided control of flexible bevel-tip nee-dles.

A crystal structure of a PrgI–SipD fusion protein docked on the PrgI needle results in steric clash of SipD at the <b>needle</b> <b>tip</b> when modeled on the recent atomic structure of the needle. Thus, there is currently no good model of how SipD is docked on the PrgI <b>needle</b> <b>tip.</b> Previously, we showed by NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) methods that a specific region in the SipD coiled coil is the binding site for PrgI.
