It has therefore been described as a reasonable alternative to demersal towed gears, and the allocation of additional fishing rights for this type of take has been suggested.|$|E

40|$|Wheelset {{maintenance}} and renewal comprises {{a significant portion}} of the whole-life cost of railway rolling stock. At present, many GB passenger trains have their wheels turned on a lathe at regular intervals to prevent the propagation of Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF) cracks in the rim. Evidence from a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>fleets</b> suggests that RCF damage occurs much more quickly as the wheelsets near the end of their life. Wheel manufacturing processes are intended to induce a compressive hoop stress in the wheel rim to reduce crack propagation rates. Variations in residual stress through the life of a wheel may potentially influence the observed damage rates. This paper describes an experiment to measure residual stresses in new and used wheel rims to identify whether this could be a significant factor. Assuming that the as-manufactured stress distribution was similar for all three wheels, it is found that the stresses are redistributed within the wheel rim during its life as material is removed and plastic flow occurs.

40|$|The {{management}} of multi-species fisheries is usually challenging {{because of the}} high <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>fleets</b> and gears targeting numerous species. In recent times, the concept of metiers has been used to enable further understanding of spatio-temporal variation of species and behaviour of fishers. In the present study, an output-based approach (i. e. the use of landing data) was used to identify potential metiers in the artisanal fisheries of the Central region of Ghana. The landing data was over a five-year period – 2004 - 2008 and based on species caught by five main gears, namely Ali-Poli-Watsa (a type of purse seine net), beach seine, drift gill net, hook and line and set net gears. Multivariate analyses, namely Canonical Correspondence Analysis, Redundancy Analysis (RDA) and Generalized Additive Models (GAM) – were used to analyze catch per unit effort (CPUE) and revenue per unit effort (RPUE) on yearly and monthly basis respectively. The environmental variables used in the multivariate analyses were gear, year, month and temperature. It was observed that changes in catch and revenue rates followed seasonal patterns, with some gears recording their maximum revenue rates in the second semester of the year. Initially, three major gear groups were identified. Subsequent analyses led to the generation of two models – prey-gear niche and niche timeline – to further explain the interactions of the various gears across months and the implications of these to fisheries management was discussed. The results from the multivariate analyses were supplemented with data obtained from interviews of fishers in Winneba fishing community. It was observed that even though fishers had high fidelity to particular gears during fishing seasons, they sometimes diversified their target species. Lack of an alternative occupation to fishers threaten their livelihoods, thus it was recommended that fisheries managers or scientists explore ways of enhancing the resilience of fishers...|$|E
40|$|The fishery {{for common}} sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) {{is the fourth}} most {{important}} French metropolitan fishery in value terms, with approximately 5 500 tons landed, and a total turnover of about 52 million euro in 2006. Given its high market value, sea bass is targeted by a range of métiers, resulting in interactions between a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>fleets.</b> The annual contributions to catches and landings {{of each of these}} fleets are highly variable, as are their level of economic dependence towards the species. Sea bass is also an emblematic species for recreational fishermen. Currently, there is no limitation on total allowable catch in this fishery, nor are catch allocations specified at the individual vessel level. The fishery thus faces the traditional difficulties of common-pool resource management, with a potential for the development of excess capacity and a risk of overexploitation. The nature and strength of externalities between fishing agents can thus be very different according to the fleets considered, and may lead to variable levels of potential support towards management decisions aimed at tackling these externalities. The aim {{of this paper is to}} simulate the response of French fishing fleets to the introduction of alternative management scenarios for the sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) fishery. The analysis is based on a bioeconomic model which includes and age-structured model of population dynamics and a detailed representation of the numerous fishing fleets which impact the stock, including the size distribution of catches per fleet and per fishing technique, and the economic status of fishing vessels. The main emphasis of the analysis is on the heterogeneity of commercial fleets in terms of both their harvesting capacity and their reliance on sea bass for their revenue; recreational fishing is also included in the analysis and adds to the heterogeneity of behaviors which are accounted for in the model. Simulation results emphasize the diversity of anticipated impacts of alternative management scenarios from both a short-term and a long-term perspective, and the associated heterogeneity of economic incentives for different fleets to support these management scenarios...|$|E
