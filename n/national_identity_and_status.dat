40|$|I {{define the}} Taiwan issue as the tense {{relationship}} between mainland China and Taiwan since 1949. The tension used to {{arise from the}} belligerency between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party. In the past decade, Taiwan increasingly sought to define its own <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> international <b>status,</b> but faced diplomatic and military pressures from mainland China, which has insisted that Taiwan is part of China. The relationship between mainland China and Taiwan {{has been one of}} the most important issues regarding the peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region. In order to explore the Taiwan issue, this research will examine the interactions among the United States, Taiwan, and mainland China in the realist perspective of international relations. The main research questions are: What determines the costs and benefits of the securit...|$|R
25|$|This was {{the fourth}} direct {{election}} for the President of the Republic of China. The two candidates were Democratic Progressive Party candidate Frank Hsieh and Kuomintang (KMT) nominee Ma Ying-jeou. The KMT ticket was officially formed as of June 23, 2007, with Ma announcing his choice for running mate to be former premier Vincent Siew. The DPP ticket was announced in August, 2007, with Frank Hsieh selecting former Premier Su Tseng-chang. Unlike the 2004 presidential election, the political rhetoric of the campaigns {{tended to focus on}} economic issues and government corruption rather than <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> the political <b>status</b> of Taiwan, with both candidates endorsing the status quo in the short term. But much like previous elections, this election was also marked with island-wide mass rallies and much political mudslinging.|$|R
40|$|This essay contextualises Shakespeare as {{product of}} a field of forces {{encapsulating}} <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> relative cultural <b>status.</b> It begins by historicising the production of national poets in Romantic and Nationalist terms. Lefevere’s conceptual grid is then used to characterise the system that underpins the production of Shakespeare as British national poet, and his place within the canon of world literature. The article defines this context first before moving onto the figure of Shakespeare, by referring to various high status texts such as the Kalevala, the Aeneid, The Faerie Queene and Paradise Lost. The position accorded Shakespeare at the apex is therefore contingent upon a series of prior operations on other texts, and their writers. Shakespeare is not conceived as attaining pre-eminence because of his own innate literary qualities. Rather, a process of elimination occurs by which the common ascription {{of the position of}} national poet to a writer of epic is shown to be a cultural impossibility for the British. Instead, via Aristotle’s privileging of tragedy over epic, the rise of Shakespeare is seen as almost a second choice because of the inappropriateness of Spenser and Milton for the position...|$|R
40|$|The {{birth of}} a {{language}} is a historical process, which develops through almost six stages corresponding to six main properties (genetic distance, geographical isolation, adoption of a writing system, elaboration of a literary koine, national consciousness, official status), which are specific to Western civilization and limited to our concern, i. e. the languages in contemporary Europe. The two last properties {{are the most important}} and conclusive in achieving the full status of language in contrast with dialect, speech, idiom, vernacular and so on. Consequently, in this perspective the {{birth of a}} language can be stated when its use is felt as a token of <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> its official <b>status</b> is recognized by politic power. The history of some interesting cases during the 20 th century, such as Luxemburgish, Feroese and Macedonian will throw a light on the possible future scenario of the languages of the Former Yugoslavia. Other disputed, although not so dramatic cases, like Sardinian, Aranese, Moldavian and Ruthenian, are dealt with together with recurrent topics on minority languages. The conclusion is that, unlike the worldwide tendency, the number of languages will probably increase within the greater European Union {{in the course of the}} 21 st century...|$|R
40|$|Later in 2009, a new Magritte Museum {{is to open}} in Brussels, located {{amidst the}} {{principal}} national cultural institutions. I my paper, I want to discuss how this new museum and its architecture are involved in issues of local and national identification. In our post-industrial era, museums and their iconic architecture are key infrastructure for successful urban economies. Presenting the oeuvres of renowned artists, monographic museums {{such as the new}} Magritte Museum, are particularly instrumental for city branding. They provide not only the much wanted landmark buildings and unique masterpieces to lure tourists, but also often foreground names and (hi) stories that help shaping the ‘brand’ of a city. (From the monographic museum to the monographic city!) But monographic museums function also in the older logic of memorial museums celebrating the nation’s or city’s geniuses, museums creating a <b>national</b> <b>identity.</b> Particularly in the nineteenth century, artists like Dürer or Rubens became national heroes, glorified with numerous statues, and with their proper museums. A biographical connection with the territory is to this day the prime condition for a ‘nationalization’, besides an international renown and a strong artist’s myth. So far, Magritte, the Brussels-based counterpart of Parisian surrealism, qualifies just like Rubens did. But in contrast with the full and sincere 19 th century identification with Rubens, today Magritte emblems Belgium’s self-image in a quasi-ironic way. Over time, Magritte’s art has been reduced and clichéd (locally) as a metaphor for all Belgian absurdities, in particular those concerning political organization, <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> the ungraspable <b>status</b> of Brussels, while Magritte has become a comic character himself, with his chapeau melon almost identical to Hergé’s Dupond & Dupont. With its collage-like design on its particular location in Brussels, the Magritte Museum testifies to the currently overtly fictionalized Belgian identity...|$|R
40|$|Description {{from the}} publisher's website: In the 1980 s China’s politicians, writers, and {{academics}} began to raise an increasingly urgent question: why had a Chinese writer {{never won a}} Nobel Prize for literature? Promoted {{to the level of}} official policy issue and national complex, Nobel anxiety generated articles, conferences, and official delegations to Sweden. Exiled writer Gao Xingjian’s win in 2000 failed to satisfactorily end the matter, and the controversy surrounding the Nobel committee’s choice has continued to simmer. Julia Lovell’s comprehensive study of China’s obsession spans the twentieth century and taps directly into the key themes of modern Chinese culture: <b>national</b> <b>identity,</b> international <b>status,</b> <b>and</b> the relationship between intellectuals and politics. The intellectual preoccupation with the Nobel literature prize expresses tensions inherent in China’s move toward a global culture {{after the collapse of the}} Confucian world-view at the start of the twentieth century, and particularly since China’s re-entry into the world economy in the post-Mao era. Attitudes toward the prize reveal the same contradictory mix of admiration, resentment, and anxiety that intellectuals and writers have long felt toward Western values as they struggled to shape a modern Chinese identity. In short, the Nobel complex reveals the pressure points in an intellectual community not entirely sure of itself. Making use of extensive original research, including interviews with leading contemporary Chinese authors and critics, The Politics of Cultural Capital is a comprehensive, up-to-date treatment of an issue that cuts to the heart of modern and contemporary Chinese thought and culture. It will be essential reading for scholars of modern Chinese literature and culture, globalization, post-colonialism, and comparative and world literature.
