In the long run, the AATC system is expected to not only allow for safe short headway operation, but also to facilitate coordinated train control and energy management. This new system will employ spread spectrum radios, installed onboard trains, at wayside locations, and at control stations, to determine train locations and reliably transfer control information. Sandia National Laboratories has worked cooperatively with BART to develop a simulator of the train control and the power consumption of the AATC system. The authors are now {{in the process of developing}} enhanced train control algorithms to supplement the safety critical controller in order to smooth out train trajectories through coordinated control of multiple trains, and to reduce energy consumption and power infrastructure requirements.

40|$|The Zr-in-rutile {{geothermometer}} {{is potentially}} a widely applicable tool to estimate peak metamorphic temperatures in rocks from diverse geological settings. In order to evaluate its usefulness and reliability to record and preserve high temperatures in granulite facies rocks, rutile from UHT rocks was investigated to assess different mechanisms of Zr (re-) distribution following cooling from high temperature. Granulite facies paragneisses from the lowermost {{part of the}} Ivrea Zone, Italy, incorporated as thin sheets into the extensive basaltic body of the Mafic Complex were selected for this study. The results show that Zr-in-rutile thermometry, if properly applied, is well suited to identify and study UHT terranes as it preserves a record of temperatures up to 1190 °C, although the thermometer is susceptible to partial post-peak metamorphic resetting by Zr diffusion. Texturally homogeneous rutile grains preserve Zr concentrations corresponding to temperatures of prograde rutile growth. Diverse rutile textures and relationships between some rutile host grains and included or adjacent Zr-bearing phases bear testimony to varying mechanisms of partial redistribution and resetting of Zr in rutile during cooling and link Zr-in-rutile temperatures to different steps of the metamorphic evolution. Rutile grains that equilibrated their Zr concentrations at temperatures above 1070 °C (i. e. 1. 1 wt% Zr) could not retain all Zr in the rutile structure during cooling and exsolved baddeleyite (ZrO 2). By subsequent reaction of baddeleyite exsolution lamellae with SiO 2, zircon needles formed before the system finally closed at 650 – 700 °C without significant net loss of Zr from the whole host rutile grain. By reintegration of zircon exsolution <b>needles,</b> <b>peak</b> metamorphic temperatures of up to 1190 °C are derived for the studied rocks, which demonstrates the suitability of this solution thermometer to record UHT conditions and also confirms the extraordinary geological setting of the lowermost part of the Ivrea Zone...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the effects of an {{increase}} in size of the recording surface of monopolar needles on motor unit potentials (MUPs). The teflon coating of the TECA monopolar needles MG 37 and MF 37, commonly used in clinical electromyography, was progressively denuded to increase the length of the recording tip to 2, 3, 5, and 10 times the normal exposure, with resultant increase {{in the area of the}} recording portion. Low threshold MUPs obtained on minimal contraction from the tibialis anterior were analyzed for amplitude, duration, area, phases, turns, peak duration, and index. The amplitude and area of the MUP showed the most change, both decreasing with progressive denudation. The number of turns and phases were also reduced, more for the MF than for the MG <b>needle.</b> Duration, <b>peak</b> duration, and index showed insignificant changes. These findings give further support to the use of duration for representation of the MUP, since this is the most stable parameter even under poor recording conditions. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|California {{utilities}} {{have been}} exploring {{the use of}} critical peak prices (CPP) to help reduce <b>needle</b> <b>peaks</b> in customer end-use loads. CPP {{is a form of}} price-responsive demand response (DR). Recent experience has shown that customers have limited knowledge of how to operate their facilities in order to reduce their electricity costs under CPP (Quantum 2004). While the lack of knowledge about how to develop and implement DR control strategies is a barrier to participation in DR programs like CPP, another barrier is the lack of automation of DR systems. During 2003 and 2004, the PIER Demand Response Research Center (DRRC) conducted a series of tests of fully automated electric demand response (Auto-DR) at 18 facilities. Overall, the average of the site-specific average coincident demand reductions was 8 % from a variety of building types and facilities. Many electricity customers have suggested that automation will help them institutionalize their electric demand savings and improve their overall response and DR repeatability. This report focuses on and discusses the specific results of the Automated Critical Peak Pricing (Auto-CPP, a specific type of Auto-DR) tests that took place during 2005, which build on the automated demand response (Auto-DR) research conducted through PIER and the DRRC in 2003 and 2004. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the technical opportunities of automating demand response and to remove technical and market impediments to large-scale implementation of automated demand response (Auto-DR) in buildings and industry. A second goal of this research is to understand and identify best practices for DR strategies and opportunities. The specific objectives of the Automated Critical Peak Pricing test were as follows: (1) Demonstrate how an automated notification system for critical peak pricing can be used in large commercial facilities for demand response (DR). (2) Evaluate effectiveness of such a system. (3) Determine how customers will respond to this form of automation for CPP. (4) Evaluate what type of DR shifting and shedding strategies can be automated. (5) Explore how automation of control strategies can increase participation rates and DR saving levels with CPP.
