Homer accompanies Ned back {{home after the}} funeral and talks with him later that night when Ned is unable to sleep due to his {{loneliness}} and now having to raise his sons alone. To help him get on with his life, Homer secretly makes a videotape of Ned to show to single girls across Springfield. Ned gets to date several women thanks to the tape, including Lindsey Naegle and Edna Krabappel, but <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> successful.|$|E

But as Trish answers a call for a new job, Dante gets Lady back for it by allowing her to tag along without getting paid. It’s clear that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> {{in it for the}} money anyway, as all three charge into the night guns blazing.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{research}} {{has estimated that}} the quake was between 6.0 and 6.3 on the Richter scale, and the United States Geological Survey lists it as the largest earthquake {{in the history of}} Massachusetts. Scientists are unclear on the causes of this and other quakes in the northeastern United States. There are a number of old faults in the region, but <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> known still to be active. It is possible that the Cape Ann earthquake may have been remotely triggered by a larger earthquake in Lisbon, Portugal, a few weeks prior, although there is not enough evidence to prove that they are linked.|$|E

25|$|In 1905, James Britten {{challenged}} the genus name Banksia, {{on the grounds}} that Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst had precedent over Banksia L.f.. Britten adopted the name Isostylis for the entire genus, republishing the names Isostylis dentata (L.f.) Britten for B.dentata (Tropical Banksia), Isostylis ericifolia (L.f.) Britten for B.ericifolia (Heath-leaved Banksia), Isostylis integrifolia (L.f.) Britten for B.integrifolia (Coast Banksia) and Isostylis serrata (L.f.) Britten for B.serrata (Saw Banksia). This challenge failed, Banksia L.f. was eventually conserved, and his four names are now considered taxonomic synonyms of their respective names under Banksia L.f. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> considered members of Isostylis.|$|E
25|$|The Sun Throne, the {{imperial}} seat of Persia, has strong relations from the Farahavar. The sovereign would be {{seated in the}} middle of the throne, which is shaped like a platform or bed that is raised from the ground. This religious-cultural symbol was adapted by the Pahlavi dynasty to represent the Iranian nation. In present-day Zoroastrianism, the Faravahar is said to be a reminder of one's purpose in life, which is to live in such a way that the soul progresses towards frashokereti, or union with Ahura Mazda, the supreme divinity in Zoroastrianism. Although there are a number of interpretations of the individual elements of the symbol, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> older than the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Brachiosaurus is the namesake genus of {{the family}} Brachiosauridae, which {{includes}} {{a handful of other}} similar sauropods. Much of what is known by laypeople about Brachiosaurus is in fact based on Giraffatitan brancai, a species of brachiosaurid dinosaur from the Tendaguru Formation of Tanzania that was originally described by German paleontologist Werner Janensch as a species of Brachiosaurus. Recent research shows that the differences between the type species of Brachiosaurus and the Tendaguru material are significant enough that the African material should be placed in a separate genus. Several other potential species of Brachiosaurus have been described from Africa and Europe, but <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> thought to belong to Brachiosaurus at this time.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there are}} {{numerous}} eternally burning Zoroastrian fires today, {{with the exception of}} the 'Fire of Warharan', <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> more than 250 years old. The legend that the Indian Zoroastrians invented the afrinagan (the metal urn in which a sacred fire today resides) when they moved the fire from Sanjan to the Bahrot caves is unsustainable. Greek historians of the Parthian period reported the use of a metal vase-like urn to transport fire. Sassanid coins of the 3rd-4th century CE likewise reveal a fire in a vase-like container identical in design to the present-day afrinagans. The Indian Zoroastrians do however export these and other utensils to their co-religionists the world over.|$|E
25|$|Some biographers, such as Theodor Adorno and Robert Gutman have {{advanced}} {{the claim that}} Wagner's opposition to Jews {{was not limited to}} his articles, and that the operas contained such messages. In particular the characters of Mime in the Ring, Klingsor in Parsifal and Sixtus Beckmesser in Die Meistersinger are supposedly Jewish stereotypes, although <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> identified as Jews in the libretto. Such claims are disputed. Wagner, {{over the course of his}} life, produced a huge amount of written material analyzing every aspect of himself, including his operas and his views on Jews (as well as many other topics); these purportedly 'Jewish' characterizations are never mentioned, nor are there any such references in Cosima Wagner's copious diaries.|$|E
25|$|Also {{within the}} scheme are two hotels, {{including}} a £15million Ramada Encore hotel with 151 {{rooms on the}} corner of Icknield Street and Pope Street. The second hotel will contain 100 rooms. Alfred McAlpine and New World Leisure have been appointed by Chord Deeley to develop and operate the hotels in a joint venture. Most of the buildings on the site are derelict and in a poor state of repair and whilst <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> listed, the Kettleworks, the former Swan kitchenware factory which dates back to 1890, is to be retained. Work began in summer 2008 on the first phase and the entire scheme is expected to be completed in 2012. It is estimated to cost £130million and is hoped that between 1,500-2,500 jobs will be created as a result.|$|E
