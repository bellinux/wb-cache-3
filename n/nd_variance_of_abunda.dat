40|$|Engel (1999) computes the <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> k-differences {{for each}} time horizon us- ing {{the method of}} Cochrane (1988) {{in order to measure}} the {{importance}} of the traded goods component in U. S. real exchange rate movements. The importance of traded goods should decrease as the horizon increases if the law of one price holds for traded goods in the long run. However, Engel ?<b>nds</b> that the <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> k-diÂ¤erences decreases only initially and then increases as k approaches the sample size. He interpets the increasing <b>variance</b> as evidence <b>of</b> an increase in the long-run importance of the traded goods component. By contrast, we show that the <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> k-diÂ¤erences tends to return to the initial value as k approaches the sample size whether the variable is stationary or unit root nonstationary. Our results imply that the increasing variances for k-values close to the sample size cannot be inter- preted as evidence of an increase in the importance of the traded goods component in the long run. We ?nd that our test results regarding the <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> k-diÂ¤erences are consistent with smaller importance of the traded goods component in the longer run.

40|$|Three {{traditional}} importance measures, risk reduction, partial derivative, <b>nd</b> <b>variance</b> reduction, {{have been}} extended to permit analyses of {{the relative importance of}} groups of underlying failure rates to the frequencies of resulting top events. The partial derivative importance measure was extended by assessing the contribution of a group of events to the gradient of the top event frequency. Given the moments of the distributions that characterize the uncertainties in the underlying failure rates, the expectation values of the top event frequency, its <b>variance,</b> and all <b>of</b> the new group importance measures can be quantified exactly for two familiar cases: (1) when all underlying failure rates are presumed independent, and (2) when pairs of failure rates based on common data are treated as being equal (totally correlated). In these cases, the new importance measures, which can also be applied to assess the importance of individual events, obviate the need for Monte Carlo sampling. The event group importance measures are illustrated using a small example problem and demonstrated by applications made as part of a major reactor facility risk assessment. These illustrations and applications indicate both the utility and the versatility of the event group importance measures...|$|R
