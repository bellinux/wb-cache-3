40|$|This paper {{examines}} ways {{in which}} simple geometric shapes {{can be used to}} represent character and create the impression of a pictorial narrative. I take a design-based approach to constructing books, focusing on the schematic, and often using unchanging, immobile stencilled shapes for the ›characters‹. The extent to which character with minimal or <b>non-existent</b> <b>body</b> and facial animation can be constructed through this kind of formal, design-based approach is examined. I focus on the use of shapes as characters, the portrayal of action and the depiction of tempo, or rhythm in a picturebook. The practical work I discuss is based chiefly on a picturebook I made based on the fairy tale The Wolf and The Seven Young Kids, by the Brothers Grimm...|$|R
2500|$|The typical {{history of}} ORS {{involves}} a long delay while the person continues {{to believe there}} is a genuine odor. On average, a patient with ORS goes undiagnosed for about 8 years. Repeated consultation with multiple different non-psychiatric medical specialists ("doctor shopping") in an attempt to have their <b>non-existent</b> <b>body</b> odor treated is frequently reported. Individuals with ORS may present to dermatologists, gastroentrologists, otolaryngologists, dentists, proctologists, and gynecologists. Despite the absence of any clinically detectable odor, physicians and surgeons may embark on unnecessary investigations (e.g. gastroscopy), and treatments, including surgery such as thoracic sympathectomy, tonsillectomy, etc. Such treatments generally have no long-term effect on the individual's belief in an odor symptom. If non-psychiatric clinicians refuse to carry out treatment on the basis that there is no real odor and offer to refer them to a psychologist or psychiatrist, persons with ORS typically refuse and instead seek [...] "a better" [...] doctor/dentist.|$|R
50|$|Devices {{implanted}} {{directly in}} the grey matter of the brain produce the highest quality signals, but are prone to scar-tissue build-up, causing the signal to become weaker, or even <b>non-existent,</b> as the <b>body</b> reacts to a foreign object in the brain.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shape of}} the sprig or [...] "Rameau" [...] {{on the top of}} the seal has changed over the centuries. Bailiff Daniel de L'Isle Brock {{commissioned}} a replacement seal in 1832 the lions or leopards becoming a caricature of true heraldic beasts. The head of the beasts took on a shape approximating to that of a shield, the mane was virtually <b>non-existent,</b> the <b>body</b> was somewhat extended and the legs were so thin they could not carry an animal. Bailiff Sir Edgar McCulloch in 1884 reverted to the traditional heraldic representation.|$|R
25|$|Invasive BCI {{research}} has targeted repairing damaged sight and providing new functionality {{for people with}} paralysis. Invasive BCIs are implanted directly into the grey matter of the brain during neurosurgery. Because they lie in the grey matter, invasive devices produce the highest quality signals of BCI devices but are prone to scar-tissue build-up, causing the signal to become weaker, or even <b>non-existent,</b> as the <b>body</b> reacts to a foreign object in the brain.|$|R
40|$|A woman?s {{physical}} appearance has been {{strongly associated with}} her sense of self-worth and success. Moreover, through family, media and one?s friends, messages of an unrealistically thin ideal body have been perpetuated, creating feelings of dissatisfaction with one?s {{physical appearance}}. While the effects of family and the media on one?s body image satisfaction have been well studied, the effects of one?s friendship group have been less often studied, and within the adult population, such literature is almost <b>non-existent.</b> Moreover, <b>body</b> image dissatisfaction can lead to dieting behaviours, which {{have been associated with}} negative consequences for one?s health; however this too, within the context of one?s friendship group within adults has not been studied. Sociotropy, how sensitive one is to interpersonal interactions, has been connected to the development of eating disorders, however its use in research in this area is limited. Thus, the current study aimed to investigate the role of sociotropy in the relationship between a woman and her closest friend?s body image satisfaction and eating behaviour. Analyses suggested that sociotropy plays a mediating role between these thoughts and behaviours, such that it partially accounts for the relationship between a person and her closest friend?s body image satisfaction, and their dieting behaviour. Qualitative data analyses demonstrated that many women are affected by their closest friend?s eating behaviours, and less directly affected by their closest friend?s body image satisfaction. The implications of these results are discussed within the paper...|$|R
50|$|George's {{body was}} sent to {{undertaker}} William Broadwell Penniman, who hesitated to have him buried until the body could be claimed. On December 31, 1902, George had drawn up a will with local lawyer Niles Houston, and it was filed with Judge Milton C. Garber on January 16, 1903. However, the property listed in the will ultimately proved <b>non-existent,</b> and the <b>body</b> remained unclaimed and unburied at Penniman's. The arsenic embalmed body sat for eight years on display in Enid at Penniman's establishment. Penniman had tied the body to a chair, opened its eyes, and placed a newspaper in its lap, creating a spectacle for passersby in the Enid downtown. As a young boy, writer Marquis James led dime tours into the funeral home to view the mummified body where it lay on a shelf. According to Penniman, 10,000 people viewed George's body during its time in Enid, including a few who clipped hair, buttons, and one even attempted to remove his ear.|$|R
40|$|AbstractLung {{epithelial}} cells use remarkably adaptive sensing and signaling systems {{to maintain a}} physiological state supporting gas exchange and minimizing environmental insults. One facet of epithelial adaptability is the reversible acquisition of mesenchymal features, a process termed epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Although in the adult, permanent and complete EMT appears rare or <b>non-existent,</b> a growing <b>body</b> of evidence implicates a critical role for the activation of EMT signaling in tissue remodeling, including fibrotic lung disease. The specific phenotypes of cells undergoing EMT re-programming during epithelial responses to injury continue to be defined and are reviewed here. Several recent studies implicate epithelial expression of canonical EMT transcription factors, such as Snail and Twist 1, with the acquisition of a less differentiated, more proliferative stem-like state, providing an additional link between activation of EMT signaling and tissue repair. In lung airways, proliferating variant clara cells rely upon Snail for effective epithelial repair, and in the breast, cells possessing the greatest regenerative capacity also express Snail 2. The ongoing elucidation of signaling underlying epithelial stem/progenitor expansion coincides with recent discoveries implicating regenerative activity in the lung, possibly including de novo regeneration of airway and alveolar units. It remains largely unknown what signals drive organization of epithelial progenitor cells that expand after lung injury, to what degree such organization is ever functionally relevant, and whether the lung regenerative potential recently observed in mouse models extends to humans. Yet these unknowns with clinical potential bring future mechanistic studies of EMT and lung repair directly into the field of regenerative medicine.
