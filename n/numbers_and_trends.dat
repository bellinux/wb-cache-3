The planet’s ecosystem is very fragile and influenced by a large array of very diverse natural and human factors which are frequently interdependent. Regardless of root cause, climate change, pollution and depletion of non-renewable resources and several other unfavorable processes are in place. We can argue that the increase of the average temperature is just a part of a long-term natural cycle and not the consequence of human negligence and pollution, but in the end, it doesn’t matter. The ecosystem is changed and agricultural plants might not survive the change and adopt in time.

40|$|In this paper, we {{make the}} case for more social science {{research}} into fire incidents and fire-related risk behaviour. Unlike other vulnerabilities, such as crime, illness or risk-associated activities such as smoking, or accident avoidance, remarkably little research has focused on this area. This is perhaps surprising given the propensity for fire, its emotional, social and economic impacts, and evidence that fires and fire victims are not equally distributed across socio-demographic or geographical domains. In making our case, we outline: recent <b>numbers</b> <b>and</b> <b>trends</b> in incidents in the UK, focusing on domestic incidents and recent policy developments affecting fire and rescue services. Next, we review the social-science based literature on fire incidents, suggesting that while this offers useful insight, much {{more needs to be done}} to develop a rigorous evidence base. While we would not want to dismiss or downplay existing social science contributions, our contention is that a considerable number of opportunities exist for further work in this area. Consequently, we propose a number of ways in which popular ideas about risk theory can be applied to a domestic fire context and raise a number of questions that social scientists are well positioned to contribute to an interdisciplinary understanding of domestic fire incidents and associated risks...|$|E

Safety is fully embedded into the staff activity and in this way, key personnel is directly involved in identifying and supplying leading indicators related to their own daily activity and is responsible and accountable for keeping the measurement matrix alive. Besides the use of lagging indicators, particular emphasis is given to the importance of identifying and selecting leading indicators which can be used to drive safety performance also for organizational and safety culture.

The purpose is to {{provide an overview of}} life insurance efficiency studies and guidance as to the (dis) advantages of the different techniques used plus their applicability to life insurance. An evaluation of the different approaches is undertaken plus an examination of the <b>numbers</b> <b>and</b> <b>trends</b> of methods and aspects of life insurance efficiency measurement. This paper also discusses the fundamental elements of life insurance efficiency estimation, such as the set-up and form of outputs and inputs. Findings include that the focus of life insurance efficiency studies considering individual nations has changed. Additionally data envelope analysis is the technique used most commonly with stochastic frontier analysis next. Another main result is that output proxies (akin to) premiums and investment income is utilized most. This study allows practitioners to determine the best techniques to employ in life insurance efficiency studies. Moreover an evaluation by regulators of the value and applicability of such studies is facilitated. This article builds upon those previous to enumerate and investigate the approaches most commonly used in over 190 papers determining life insurance efficiency and has described {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} these methods. Therefore an assessment of the overall results of efficiency studies is possible. In addition ideas for potential further research are discussed.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a review of}} the breeding <b>numbers</b> <b>and</b> <b>trends</b> of three ‘smaller’ gull species breeding in Flanders, Belgium: Blackheaded Gull Larus ridibundus, Mediterranean Gull Larus melanocephalus and Common Gull Larus canus. The emphasis is laid on the period 1994 - 2001. The Black-headed Gull is the most common breeding gull species in Flanders. Between 1994 and 2001, the Flemish breeding population fluctuated between 12. 000 and more than 20. 000 pairs. Since the beginning of the 1980 ’s, there is no clear trend and the populations seems to be quite stable, despite some short term fluctuations. The decline of breeding colonies in natural (heathland) habitat is fully compensated by the increase of breeding colonies on artificial (industrial) sites. The Mediterranean Gull is a relatively new breeding bird in Flanders (since 1964). Numbers rose very strong in the 1990 s, resulting in a record number of 480 pairs in 1999. In 2000 and 2001 the Flemish breeding population reached about 300 pairs. The Flemish breeding population makes part of the adjacent population in the Dutch Delta-area, with a total breeding population for both areas of 1800 pairs in 2001. The Common Gull started breeding in Flanders in 1924 but until now, despite a slight increase in numbers, there hasn’t been a real breakthrough. In 2001, the Flemish population equals about 36 - 45 breeding pairs, most of which were found in the outer harbour of Zeebrugge...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{current status}} and future needs of {{peripheral}} endovascular utilization and training {{have not been}} well defined. This topic is particularly relevant {{to the future of}} four specialties: interventional cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, interventional radiology, and peripheral vascular surgery. We attempt to analyze the current numbers of cardiovascular patients and procedures and the numbers of treating physicians and surgeons to make predictions and recommendations for the future. Methods: The numbers of cardiovascular patients and procedures were obtained from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Trend Query web site. The number of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs was obtained with telephone or e-mail contact with the aortic endograft manufacturers. The numbers of different cardiovascular specialists were obtained with contact with different cardiovascular professional societies and the American Board of Specialists via telephone, e-mail, or web site. The numbers of accredited US cardiovascular fellowship programs and first year spots were obtained from the Graduate Medical Education Directory 2000 to 2001. Finally, the numbers of endovascular fellowship programs and first year spots were obtained with contact with the individual programs. Results: The numbers of cardiovascular patients and procedures have risen from 1993 to 1997. This trend is expected to continue as the population ages. Despite the rapid rise of endovascular procedures, the number of open cases has continued to rise as well. However, the number of cardiovascular specialists is predicted to remain stable. Specific <b>numbers</b> <b>and</b> <b>trends</b> are depicted in the manuscript. Conclusion: Our analysis shows that a critical shortage of endovascular trained specialists will exist in the future.

Data for analysis were obtained from The National Center for Health Statistics-National Hospital Discharge Survey and questionnaires sent to 2732 vascular surgeons. The data showed that SVS/NA-ISCVS and regional vascular society (RVS) surgeons performed 51 % of 583, 000 vascular procedures undertaken in the United States in 1992. This represents a 24 % increase over the 41 % reported in 1985 by similarly defined surgeons. Analysis of 1992 index cases documented that SVS/NA-ISCVS and RVS surgeons accounted for 80 % of 31, 000 aortoiliofemoral bypasses, 68 % of 46, 000 aortic aneurysmectomies, 64 % of 91, 000 carotid endarterectomies, and 72 % of 98, 000 angioaccess procedures. The mean numbers of vascular operations performed in 1992 by SVS/NA-ISCVS and RVS surgeons were 144 and 100, respectively. These procedures represented 64 % and 39 % of the total surgical caseload of SVS/NA-ISCVS and RVS surgeons, respectively. American Board of Surgery (ABS) -certified vascular surgeons performed a mean of 171 vascular operations in 1992. Other surgeons, including ABS-certified general surgeons, appear to be performing fewer vascular operations. The latter fact and the increasing incidence of vascular disease in an expanding elderly population supports a continued need for vascular surgery specialists. Evolving technology and new health care delivery systems, however, may lessen the need for surgical care of these patients. Continued assessments of workforce activity will allow better definition of changing vascular surgery needs...|$|E

40|$|Given {{a history}} of {{detected}} malware attacks, can we predict the number of malware infections in a country? Can we do this for different malware and countries? This is an important question which has numerous implications for cyber security, right from designing better anti-virus software, to designing and implementing targeted patches to more accurately measuring {{the economic impact of}} breaches. This problem is compounded by the fact that, as externals, we can only detect a fraction of actual malware infections. In this paper we address this problem using data from Symantec covering more than 1. 4 million hosts and 50 malware spread across 2 years and multiple countries. We first carefully design domain-based features from both malware and machine-hosts perspectives. Secondly, inspired by epidemiological and information diffusion models, we design a novel temporal non-linear model for malware spread and detection. Finally we present ESM, an ensemble-based approach which combines both these methods to construct a more accurate algorithm. Using extensive experiments spanning multiple malware and countries, we show that ESM can effectively predict malware infection ratios over time (both the actual <b>number</b> <b>and</b> <b>trend)</b> upto 4 times better compared to several baselines on various metrics. Furthermore, ESM 2 ̆ 7 s performance is stable and robust even when the number of detected infections is low...|$|R

In this paper, factors determining species richness of urban flora were studied {{for the city of}} Rome, Italy, based on a comprehensive floristic survey carried out between 1985 and 1994, and updated in 2005. All species were recorded in grid cells of 1. 6 km(2) and classified into native and alien (the latter divided into archaeophytes and neophytes). The grids were classified with respect to the prevailing habitat type, area available to vegetation, level of disturbance and geographical position within the city. Data were analysed using minimal adequate models. Total species number was determined by habitat and its interaction with position on the north-west gradient; other variables explained much less variance. Holding other variables constant, the average species number per grid cell was highest in archaeological sites and parks, followed by woodlands and rivers, and grasslands and recent developments. Residential areas and the historical centre were poorest in species number. Towards the north of the city, species richness in corresponding habitats increases because of higher landscape heterogeneity and closer association with diaspore pools in the surroundings. Native species make up on average 84 % of the total species <b>numbers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>trends</b> opposite to those for the total number of species were found for the proportional representation of aliens. The occurrence of alien and native species in the flora of Rome is driven by similar factors, but factors that increase representation of aliens decrease that of natives and vice versa. The representation of neophytes and native species in grid cells was easier to explain (74 % of variation accounted for) than that of archaeophytes (27 %); this result reflects that in terms of ecology and response to factors, archaeophytes take an intermediate position between native plants and neophytes. Proportional representation of neophytes decreased with increasing area available to vegetation, reflecting that semi-natural vegetation is better developed where less fragmented...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This thesis {{analyzes}} the Crowd-Labor phenomenon, {{a subset of}} the Crowdsourcing industry where users of the related online platforms post tasks/projects and other users work on those tasks, usually in exchange for a payment. This work documents the current status of the platforms operating in this industry, providing new information regarding the <b>numbers</b> <b>and</b> <b>trends.</b> Its second objective is to understand how those companies are organized, what features they possess and how those features are related across different types of platforms. Methodology: Data collection regarding seventy-seven (77) characteristics from fifty-one (51) platforms. The characteristics are about the platforms themselves, their operations and the features they offer to their users. That was followed by an analysis of the data, and a grouping of certain related characteristics (for example, the sum of the number of available languages on the platform) and a correlation analysis to understand which types of platforms exist and what kind of platforms obtain that best performance. Findings: The analysis revealed that there are clusters of platforms based on the type of tasks/projects available on those platforms. Industry characteristics related with performance were analyzed, namely the existence of a forum, APIs, open challenges, the possibility of login & register using Facebook, fix payment fees for contractors, a leaderboard, the existence of multiple languages, internal exams for contractors to get certifications, tracking quality mechanisms and the possibility of project owners only paying when satisfied. Automated features (APIs and internal exams/certifications) stood out as a new positive performance differentiator for this recent industry, which is an original literature contribution originated from this thesis. Practical use: This work presents {{the current state of the}} Crowd-Labor industry, its benchmarks or industry standards, users’ motivations and a fact based opinion regarding its future, creating new knowledge that could be particularly useful for researchers, academics, crowdsourcing initiative owners, crowd-Labor users, entrepreneurs and investors. Limitations: An important limitation is that some of the answers to the characteristics used to analyze the Crowd-Labor Platforms were not made public by the platform owners, which didn’t make possible to capture the full picture of some of these platforms. However by studying 51 platforms, the collected data offers statistical evidence in the form of correlations that are statistically significant, which support the conclusions drawn from the analysis...|$|E
40|$|Postcolonial Polysystems: The Production and Reception of Translated Children’s Literature in South Africa is an {{original}} and provocative {{contribution to the}} field of children’s literature research and translation studies. It draws on a variety of methodologies to provide a perspective, both product- and process-oriented, on the ways in which translation contributes to the production of children’s literature in South Africa, with a special interest in language and power, as well as post- and neocolonial hybridity. The book explores the forces that affect the use of translation in producing children’s literature in various languages in South Africa, and shows how some of these forces precipitate in the selection, production and reception of translated children’s books in Afrikaans and English. It breaks new ground in its interrogation of aspects of translation theory within the multilingual and postcolonial context of South Africa, as well as in its innovative experimental investigation of the reception of domesticating and foreignising strategies in translated picture books.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} certain {{important aspects}} of the fuzzy logic extension, one of which is OFN. It includes basic definitions of that discipline. It also compares fuzzy logic arithmetic with the arithmetic of ordered fuzzy numbers in L-R notation. Computational experiments were based on fuzzy observation of the impounding basin. The results of the study show that there is a connection between the order of OFN <b>number</b> <b>and</b> <b>trend</b> of changes in the environment. The experiment was carried out using computer software developed specially for that purpose. When comparing the arithmetic of fuzzy numbers in L-R notation with the arithmetic of ordered fuzzy numbers {{on the grounds of the}} experiment, it has been concluded that with fuzzy numbers it is possible to expand the scope of solutions in comparison to fuzzy numbers in classic form. The symbol of OFN flexibility is the possibility to determine the X number that always satisfies the equation A+X = C, regardless of the value of arguments. Operations performed on OFN are less complicated, as they are performed in the same way regardless the sign of the input data and their results are more accurate in the majority of cases. The promising feature of ordered fuzzy numbers is their lack of rapidly growing fuzziness. Authors expect to see implication of that fact in practice in the near future...|$|R
40|$|Because of the {{difficulties}} encountered in detecting many large tropical forest-dwelling species in their natural habitat, precise figures concerning the distribution, <b>number</b> <b>and</b> <b>trends</b> of many populations remain deficient. In tropical forests, ground surveys are generally carried out by counting objects along straight lines. These counts require a strict compliance with the line-transect methodology before (proper design of the census), during (careful data collection) and after (accurate and correct data processing and analysis) the census itself. In addition, {{the major source of}} bias when estimating population size and/or trends comes from the extrapolation of estimates obtained in small sampling areas to the larger, and often incompletely known, distribution of the population. In the Kinabatangan floodplain (Sabah, Malaysia), helicopter surveys were useful in directly assessing the distribution of orang-utans and were a major advantage in the precise estimation {{of the size of the}} orang-utan population surviving in this region. Our survey showed that about 1100 orang-utans remain in the multiple-use forests of the Kinabatangan floodplain. These results provide new evidence on orangutan adaptation to habitat disturbance and indicate the potential of the Kinabatangan multiple-use forests for orang-utan conservation. Helicopter surveys appear to be a promising alternative to ground survey for precise distribution assessment and for monitoring population trends of apes throughout their entire range in Asia an...|$|R
