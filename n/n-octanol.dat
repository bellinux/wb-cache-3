50|$|While SERS can be {{performed}} in colloidal solutions, today the most common method for performing SERS measurements is by depositing a liquid sample onto a silicon or glass surface with a nanostructured noble metal surface. While the first experiments were performed on electrochemically roughened silver, now surfaces are often prepared using a distribution of metal nanoparticles on the surface as well as using lithography or porous silicon as a support. Two dimensional silicon nanopillars decorated with silver have also been used to create SERS active substrates. Applying a thin film of silver onto wafers of silicon, through a day-long immersion in a saturated solution of silver nitrate in <b>n-octanol,</b> is a widely accepted method to prepare a surface-enhanced Raman scattering substrate. The most common metals used for plasmonic surfaces are silver and gold; however, aluminum has recently been explored as an alternative plasmonic material, because its plasmon band is in the UV region, contrary to silver and gold. Hence, there is great interest in using aluminum for UV SERS. It has, however, surprisingly {{also been shown to}} have a large enhancement in the infrared, which is not fully understood. In the current decade, it has been recognized that the cost of SERS substrates must be reduced in order to become a commonly used analytical chemistry measurement technique. To meet this need, plasmonic paper has experienced widespread attention in the field, with highly sensitive SERS substrates being formed through approaches such as soaking, in-situ synthesis, screen printing and inkjet printing.|$|E

GABA-evoked cur-rents had an EC 50 of 13. 3 6 1. 7 mM and a Hill coefficient (nH) of 1. 4 6 0. 1. <b>n-Octanol</b> was also capable of evoking a small current with an EC 50 of 1000 mM and an nH of 2. In addition, <b>n-octanol</b> modulated GABA-induced currents in a concentration-dependent manner. Coapplications of <b>n-octanol</b> increased peak currents evoked by 3 mM GABA with an EC 50 of 190 mM and an nH of 1. 8. The extent of potentiation decreased with increasing GABA con-centrations and no potentiation was observed when <b>n-octanol</b> was coapplied with 1000 mM GABA. One-minute preapplication of 1000 mM <b>n-octanol</b> slightly potentiated 3 mM GABA-induced cur-rent, whereas it suppressed 300 mM GABA-induced current to 16 % of the control, suggesting that 84 % of the receptors under-went desensitization.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} a new method based on {{supercritical}} carbon dioxide (scCO 2) to fill and distribute the porous magnetic nanoparticles with <b>n-octanol</b> in a homogeneous manner. The high solubility of <b>n-octanol</b> in scCO 2 and high diffusivity and permeability of the fluid allow efficient delivery of <b>n-octanol</b> into the porous magnetic nanoparticles. Thus, the n-octanol-loaded magnetic nanoparticles can be readily dispersed into aqueous buffer (pH 7. 40) to form a homogenous suspension consisting of nano-sized <b>n-octanol</b> droplets. We refer this suspension as the <b>n-octanol</b> stock solution. The <b>n-octanol</b> stock solution is then mixed with bulk aqueous phase (pH 7. 40) containing an organic compound prior to magnetic separation. The small-size of the particles and the efficient mixing enable a rapid establishment of the partition equilibrium of the organic compound between the solid supported <b>n-octanol</b> nano-droplets and the bulk aqueous phase. UV-vis spectrophotometry is then applied to determine the concentration of the organic compound in the aqueous phase {{both before and after}} partitioning (after magnetic separation). As a result, log D values of organic compounds of pharmaceutical interest determined by this modified method are found to be in excellent agreement with the literature data. © 2006 Elsevier B. V.

When Z(exp) was lower than 1, N 1923 extraction followed the order: <b>n-octanol</b> > butyl acetate > hexane. When the loading ratio Z(exp) was higher than 1, the order changed to: butyl acetate > hexane > <b>n-octanol.</b> Equilibrium complex constants K(11), K(21), K(31) have been estimated.

30|$|Water, <b>n-octanol</b> and {{the test}} {{compound}} are equilibrated in a thermostated stirred reactor at constant temperature. Exchange between the phases is improved by carefully controlled stirring (150  rpm) which limits turbulence, thereby enhancing the exchange between <b>n-octanol</b> and water and thus increasing {{the accuracy of the}} determination of the Kow value. In practice, for each test compound log Kow values were generated at a range of volume ratios of <b>n-octanol</b> and water (i.e. 0.5 : 1, 1 : 1 and 2 : 1) for each of two (normally 48  h and a longer period, either 148  h or 168  h) or more stir periods. In this experiment, the majority of the test compounds (# 1 – 6, 10 – 12) were added to the water phase, while the cationics and reference compound (# 7 – 9, 13, 14) were added to the <b>n-octanol</b> phase. It is considered that either application mode should give the correct log Kow value, the main justifications for adding cationics in <b>n-octanol,</b> are that (a) they were soluble in this solvent and (b) this application mode would reduce any losses resulting from their strong adsorption to glass surfaces. Further studies were carried out for test compounds # 2, 3 and 12 using both improved, more sensitive, analytical methods and over longer stir periods (48  h, 168  h, 240  h and 336  h) to ensure equilibration had been reached. These three compounds were applied in both the water and <b>n-octanol</b> phases. For these three compounds, reasonably consistent data as demonstrated from the mean and standard errors (Additional file 2 : Table S 2) were generated for each test compound at time points 168  h, 240  h and 336  h and for both phases so a mean value was calculated from these time points and under both dosing methods.

30|$|The slow-stirring method (OECD Test Guideline 123) was {{followed}} which minimises turbulence and thereby enhances the exchange between <b>n-octanol</b> and water without microdroplets being formed.

The labeling was disrupted by the ionophores monensin and nigericin, suggesting a labeling confined to acidic structures. Rhodamine B co-localized with the lysosomotropic dye Lyso Tracker Green and a marker for endocytosis (fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran).

Even where it has been possible to get realistic solubility data in this study, the correlation between log Kow values using the solubility ratio method and other approaches is generally low as observed from the R 2 values. C 12 EO 8 is the only surfactant with comparable values generated using both the HPLC and solubility ratio methods and these show between 2.02 and 3.31 log units difference between values generated by both methods. When comparing with slow-stirring log Kow values, the datasets generated using both methods show good correlation for cationic compounds (R 2 [*]=[*] 1 and a slope of 1.2) but either no correlation (for anionics, R 2 [*]=[*] 0.0004) or too few data to make any firm conclusions on the remaining two surfactant categories (Fig.  2). Despite good correlation observed with the cationics, the solubility ratio method cannot be applied to all surfactants when solubility cannot be determined in either or both of the solvent phases. Given that the EU TGD also recommends treating the method with caution for reasons of poor correlation typically observed between octanol solubility and Kow [4], the solubility ratio method is not recommended as a robust or accurate method for the determination of log Kow values for the four classes of surfactants assessed in this study.|$|E

During the forward extraction process, it was revealed that a high value of solubilization of protein in Aliquat 336 reversed micelles could be achieved when four out of the six alkanes (cyclohexane, n-hexane, isooctane, n-octane) were used as the solvent for Aliquat 336. After a full forward and backward extraction cycle, however, a high {{recovery of}} both the protein mass and alpha-amylase activity in the stripping solution could be obtained only when two out of the six alkanes (n-hexane and isooctane) were used as the solvent for Aliquat 336. When n-hexane and isooctane were used as the solvent for Aliquat 336, up to 80 % of the total alpha-amylase activity in the crude enzyme preparation could be recovered at the end of extraction cycle, meanwhile alpha-amylase could be concentrated about 1. 4 -fold. In the cases of other four alkanes (cyclohexane, n-octane, n-decane, and n-dodecane) as solvent, most of the a-amylase activity in the crude enzyme preparation would be denatured after an extraction cycle...|$|E
