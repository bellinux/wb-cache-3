5|$|Late on November1, a large eye redeveloped, and the JTWC {{estimated}} Krosa attained peak 1minute sustained {{winds of}} 185km/h (115mph). Early the next day, the JMA also estimated the typhoon reached peak 10minute winds of 140km/h (85mph). Later, increasing wind shear caused {{the eye to}} deteriorate, and Krosa began slowing about 260km (160mi) east-southeast of Hong Kong after reaching {{the western edge of}} the subtropical ridge. After remaining nearly stationary, Krosa began moving steadily to the west-southwest due to a <b>new</b> <b>ridge.</b> The convection continued to weaken due to continued shear and cooler waters from upwelling, and Krosa deteriorated to tropical storm status on November3. The next day, the JTWC issued its final advisory after the circulation became exposed from the convection. Also on November4, the JMA downgraded Krosa to tropical depression status off the northeast Vietnam coast. The system dissipated at 0000UTC on November5.|$|E
5|$|While at {{its peak}} strength, Cimaron {{displayed}} two small concentric eyewalls, separated by a few kilometres. The storm later made landfall near Casiguran, Aurora in northern Luzon shortly after 1200UTC on October29; it {{became one of the}} strongest storms to ever hit the region. Interaction with the island's mountainous terrain caused substantial weakening, though Cimaron maintained typhoon status during its 12‑hour crossing. After emerging over the South China Sea on October30, the system initially maintained its west-northwest course. However, the following day, a weakness developed within the ridge previously steering the typhoon, and Cimaron briefly turned north before essentially stalling. During this time, the system reorganized somewhat and reached a secondary peak intensity with winds of 165km/h (105mph) on November2. While executing a tight clockwise loop, increased wind shear and entrainment of dry air soon caused Cimaron to dramatically weaken. With a <b>new</b> <b>ridge</b> becoming established over China, the weakening system acquired a general southwestward track. Cimaron weakened to a tropical depression on November4 and ultimately dissipated three days later just off the coast of southeastern Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Ridge Road was {{constructed}} as a concrete road between Provinces and MD 176 in 1929. The highway was originally the easternmost part of MD 175. MD 713 {{was assigned to}} Ridge Road by 1946 after MD 175 had been extended southeast toward Odenton. MD 713 was widened between MD 175 and MD 176 in 1951. The highway was extended south from MD 175 to its present terminus {{at the entrance to}} Fort Meade in 1967. MD 713 was relocated and expanded to a multi-lane divided highway from south of Ridge Chapel Road to the intersection of <b>New</b> <b>Ridge</b> Road and Ridge Road north of MD 176 in 1995 in conjunction with the construction of MD 100 and the interchange between the two highways. A section of <b>New</b> <b>Ridge</b> Road remained part of MD 713 until the state highway was truncated at MD 176 in 1999. The old alignment of Ridge Road became part of MD 713B (Ridge Chapel Road) and all of MD 713C (Teague Road) south of MD 100, and MD 713D (Ridge Road) north of MD 100 to MD 176. The newly relocated section of MD 713 was relocated again in 2000 with the construction of Arundel Mills Boulevard to create a four-way intersection between the boulevard, the Ridge Road segment of MD 713, and an entrance to Arundel Mills, which opened the same year.|$|E

500|$|During the {{afternoon}} of January 10, Roy reached its peak intensity as a low-range Category4 equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, attaining peak winds of 215km/h (135mph). At the same time, the JMA estimated that the storm attained peak winds of 155km/h (100mph) along with a barometric pressure of 940mbar (hPa; 27.76inHg). Upon reaching this strength, the storm was situated roughly [...] east-southeast of Guam. Over the following few days, Roy gradually slowed and weakened as it neared the Mariana Islands. The storm made its closest approach to the islands early on January 12, passing within [...] south of Rota. As the storm passed through the region, a <b>new</b> <b>ridge</b> built east of the typhoon, causing Roy to temporarily track southwestward before resuming a westward movement.|$|E
500|$|The shortwave trough {{that had}} been {{steering}} Gordon across Florida moved ahead of the storm and its influence {{was replaced by a}} mid-tropospheric ridge over the eastern United States. Under the influence of this <b>new</b> <b>ridge</b> the storm, which had been speeding northeast at 25 mph (40 km/h), turned to the north late on November 17. The hurricane's loop continued, and as it moved to a west-northwesterly heading Gordon briefly threatened North Carolina's Outer Banks before stalling offshore once again. In the presence of weak steering currents once again, Gordon lost [...] strength and slipped back to tropical storm status with 70 mph (110 km/h) winds. On November 18, about 90 mi (150 km) off the Outer Banks, Gordon began a southward drift away from the North Carolina coast. In its brush with the Mid-Atlantic States, Gordon dropped 2–5 in (5–13 cm) with a maximum of 5.25 in (13.3 cm) recorded at Norfolk, Virginia. Warm waters improved its organization, but this did not result in stronger winds and the storm continued to weaken. Strong upper-level winds battered the storm from the northwest. They sheared away Gordon's upper-level convection while polluting the storm with colder and drier air that weakened its lower level convection.|$|E

40|$|A {{new product}} {{containing}} 65 % castor oil with the trade name Mole-Med was evaluated for its effectiveness in repelling eastern moles (Scalopus aquaticus) from lawns. Seven lawns in southern Michigan during September, 1993 {{was selected as}} preliminary test sites, and the ridges over mole tunnels in the lawns were flattened each day for 3 days. If some existing and <b>new</b> <b>ridges</b> were raised each day, the site was classified as having mole activity and continuing damage. The repellent was then applied according to label directions, and ridges above mole tunnels were flattened as described previously. If no tunnels were raised on the test lawn after one week, the repellent {{was considered to be}} effective. The repellent was classified as effective on all 7 test lawns. In May-July, 1994, 17 additional lawns were selected {{in the same way as}} preliminary test sites and classified as having or not having mole damage. Eleven received repellent treatment, while 6 were considered control, 3 adjacent to a treated area, 3 not adjacent to treated areas. Raised mole produced ridges were flatted on all test sites. On any site where ridges remained flattened and no <b>new</b> <b>ridges</b> were created for one week, moles were considered repelled. Mole activity as indicated by raised ridges ceased on eleven treated sites but continued on 5 of 6 control sites. The effectiveness of the repellent as indicated by the lack of <b>new</b> <b>ridges</b> continued for 65 days on one treatment site and for 30 days on the remaining treatment sites...|$|R

60|$|An exact {{correspondence}} between the details of two minutiæ is of secondary importance. Thus, the commonest point of reference is a bifurcation; now the neck or point of divergence of a <b>new</b> <b>ridge</b> is apt {{to be a little}} low, and sometimes fails to take the ink; hence a <b>new</b> <b>ridge</b> may appear in one of the prints to have an independent origin, and in the other to be a branch. The apparent origin is therefore of little importance, the main fact to be attended to is that a <b>new</b> <b>ridge</b> comes into existence at a particular point; how it came into existence is a secondary matter. Similarly, an apparently broken ridge may in reality be due to an imperfectly printed enclosure; and an island in one print may appear as part of an enclosure in the other. Moreover, this variation in details may be the effect not only of imperfect inking or printing, but of disintegration due to old age, which renders the impressions of the ridges ragged and broken, as in my own finger prints on the title-page.|$|E

60|$|Plate 11, Fig. 18 {{explains}} {{the nature of}} the apparent discrepancies better than a verbal description. In a a <b>new</b> <b>ridge</b> appears to be suddenly intruded between two adjacent ones, which have separated to make room for it; but a second print, taken from the same finger, may have the appearance of either b or c, showing that the <b>new</b> <b>ridge</b> is in reality a fork of one or other of them, the low connecting neck having failed to leave an impression. The second line of examples shows how an enclosure which is clearly defined in d may give rise to the appearance of broken continuity shown in e, and how a distinct island f in one of the prints may be the remnant of an enclosure which is shown in the other. These remarks are offered as a caution against attaching undue importance to disaccord in the details of the minutiæ that are found in the same place in different prints. Usually, however, the distinction between a fork and the beginning of a <b>new</b> <b>ridge</b> is clear enough; the islands and enclosures are also mostly well marked.|$|E
60|$|Welland {{considered}} {{the rate of}} speed; felt, rather than calculated, the angle of inclination; leaned over boldly until the tire almost slipped sideways on the road, and came rushing round with a magnificent sweep, when, horrible sight! a slight ridge {{of what is called}} road-metal crossed the entire road from side to side! A drain or water pipe had recently been repaired, and the <b>new</b> <b>ridge</b> had not yet been worn down by traffic. There was no time for thought or change of action. Another moment and the wheel was upon it, the crash came, and the rider went off with such force that he was shot well in advance of the machine, as it went with tremendous violence into the ditch. If Welland's feet had been on the treadles he must have turned a complete somersault. As it was he alighted on his feet, but came to the ground with such force that he failed to save himself. One frantic effort he made and then went down headlong and rolled over on his back in a state of insensibility.|$|E
