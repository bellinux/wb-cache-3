5|$|During Frank's {{election}} campaign, Claire {{begins to}} question whether she still loves him. In the season finale, she and Frank get into an ugly fight in which she says he is <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> her; Frank replies that without him, she is nothing. Season three ends with Claire leaving Frank {{as he prepares to}} go to the New Hampshire primary.|$|E
5|$|England {{played two}} Test matches against Pakistan in June 2001. Although Trescothick scored 117 {{in the second}} Test, it was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> England to win the match. His ODI form {{improved}} {{at the start of}} the 2001 NatWest Series against Australia and Pakistan, with scores of 69 and 137 respectively. However, his series ended with two consecutive ducks, and England lost all their matches in the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Ring's {{performances}} were <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> {{him to take}} McCool's place in Bradman's first-choice team. Instead, Bill Johnston, who had taken 10/40 against Yorkshire and 11/117 against Hampshire on damp surfaces, was given the place on the opening morning of the First Test when rain appeared likely. Johnston then took nine wickets in Australia's victory, cementing his position in the team. This left Ring jostling with the other spinnersJohnson and McCoolfor one spot in the Test team.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} gave Harper's Conservatives {{the largest}} number of seats in the House, although <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> a majority government, and shortly after midnight on January 24, Martin conceded defeat. Later that day, Martin informed Governor General Michaëlle Jean that he would resign as prime minister, and at 6:45p.m. Jean asked Harper to form a government. Harper was sworn in as Canada's 22nd prime minister on February 6, 2006.|$|E
5|$|An upstart {{baseball}} league {{was created}} in 1884 by Henry Lucas called the Union Association(UA). Several member of the Blues' signed contracts with teams in the UA despite being subject to the reserve clause: including star players McCormick, Dunlap, and Jack Glasscock. These moves caused the Blues to become financially unstable. However, the franchise was able to secure {{a deal with the}} league for a better share of gate receipts. This deal was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the franchise to profit, and Bulkeley sold the team to Lucas for $2,500 ($ current dollar adjustment) following the conclusion of the 1884season.|$|E
5|$|Chambers {{broke the}} ten second barrier {{twice in the}} 2001 World Championships with a {{personal}} best of 9.97s in the quarter finals and a run of 9.99s in the final. This was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> a medal in a strong race which featured five sprinters running under ten seconds and saw Greene defend his title. Chambers was later upgraded to fourth place after silver medallist Tim Montgomery tested positive for banned substances. A hamstring injury in the final ruled {{him out of the}} 200m event. Chambers ended his season at the 2001 Goodwill Games in Brisbane and finished in first place {{in the absence of an}} injured Greene, who commentated on his European rival's victory.|$|E

5|$|His first {{goals of}} the new year came on, on 4 January, as he scored twice against Dundee United. However, this was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> a victory and the match {{finished}} 2–2. Although he did not start in the League Cup Final due to poor form, he did come on as a substitute as Celtic beat Rangers 2–0 and won the trophy. Samaras scored twice on 4 April, as Celtic beat Hamilton Academical 4–0. Celtic lost the title {{on the last day of}} the season. Samaras scored 17 goals, with 15 of them coming in the SPL. This made him the third top scorer behind Kris Boyd and team mate Scott McDonald.|$|E

Lokvenc {{featured}} less for Salzburg in the 2007–08 season, prompting him to join Swiss Super League team Basel on loan in February 2008 {{for the remainder of the}} season. He scored in Basel's 1–0 semi-final Swiss Cup victory against Thun. The club went on to win the 2008 league championship title and the 2008 Swiss Cup.|$|E
5|$|In the quarter-finals, Barcelona {{were drawn}} against their fellow leading-scorers in the competition, Bayern Munich, who had beaten Barcelona's group stage opposition, Sporting CP, 12–1 on {{aggregate}} {{in the previous}} round. However, despite Bayern's impressive scoring record, goals from Messi and Eto'o gave Barcelona a 2–0 lead within the first 12minutes. Messi and Henry also scored to seal a 4–0 home victory before half-time. The lack of an away goal meant Bayern Munich would have to win by five clear goals {{to qualify for the}} semi-finals. After a goalless first half, they took the lead through Franck Ribéry in the 47thminute, but it was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Bayern as Keita equalised in the 73rdminute to clinch a 5–1 aggregate win for the Spanish side.|$|E

5|$|Karthik was not {{selected}} for the ODIs against Pakistan and returned to action in one-dayers for Tamil Nadu in the meantime, but managed only 59 runs at 19.66 in three matches. Karthik returned to India after Zimbabwe tour in 2006 and made 26 and 11 in the Challenger Trophy for India A, which was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> him to force his way into India’s squad for the home ODIs against Sri Lanka and South Africa. In the meantime, {{he played in the}} Duleep Trophy and had the chance to make his case for Test retention. However, he scored only 106 runs at 26.50 in two matches and South Zone lost both of these and were eliminated, and Karthik spent the next month on the sidelines.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{had a more}} {{productive}} campaign during the 1952–53 season, scoring 470 runs at 33.57 and taking 23 wickets at 26.26 in nine matches. He broke through for his first first-class century in three years when he made 169 against New South Wales, {{but it was not}} enough to prevent an innings defeat. He scored 60 and took a match total of 5/102 in a match for Victoria against the touring South Africans early in the season, but this was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> him to regain his Test position. He bowled with steady results throughout the season, never taking more than three wickets in an innings and five in a match.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{retired after}} {{playing in the}} 1957–58 season. With the Test players in South Africa, he made 331 runs at 41.37 {{including}} 2 centuries, and took 9 wickets at 26.33 in 8 matches. He made 107 in an innings triumph over Queensland and 106 in a drawn match against South Australia. It was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> him to win a third Sheffield Shield title; New South Wales won for the fifth successive time, defeating Victoria in both of their matches. Loxton made little impact in his final match; although the Victorians defeated Queensland, his only participation was to score five runs in the first innings. His highest score remained the 232 not out he had made on his first-class debut.|$|E

5|$|Stan Collymore, Fowler's strike partner from 1995–97, {{said in his}} {{autobiography}} that Fowler was the best player he has ever played alongside. Fowler and Collymore {{were among the most}} prolific goal-scoring strike partnerships in England during the 1995–96 season. In the same season he scored twice in a 4–3 victory over Newcastle United, a match voted the best of the decade in a Premier League poll. The match helped prevent Newcastle from winning the league, but it was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Liverpool to clinch the title; they finished third while Manchester United were crowned champions. Fowler also played in his first FA Cup final that season, but was on the losing side as Manchester United won 1–0.|$|E
5|$|The third match saw Suzuki-gun's Davey Boy Smith Jr., Lance Archer, Shelton Benjamin, and Takashi Iizuka {{opposing}} Toru Yano and Pro Wrestling Noah representatives Naomichi Marufuji, Mikey Nicholls, and Shane Haste. Smith's powerbomb of Nicholls, Archer's chokeslam of Haste, and Benjamin's super overhead belly-to-belly throw of Marufuji were <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the victory; {{the opposing}} team overwhelmed Iizuka with a low blow by Yano, a double-team gorilla press slam by TMDK, and a Tiger Uppercut knee lift by Marufuji. This led to Marufuji scoring a pinfall on Iizuka at 5 minutes and 5 seconds.|$|E
5|$|There {{was another}} match for Victoria against South Australia before the Tests, {{allowing}} him {{another chance to}} push his claim for national selection. It was also his first Sheffield Shield match; his previous appearances for Victoria in interstate games were in seasons where the competition was called off due to war and replaced by one-off matches. Harvey could manage only 9 as Victoria amassed 548 in their first innings. They needed 79 runs for victory in 35 minutes on the last afternoon, and with quick scoring required, the more aggressive Keith Miller opened in place of Harvey. When the first wicket fell with the target almost completed, Harvey came in and made three not out {{by the time the}} match was over. These performances were <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the Australian selectors and Harvey was overlooked for the team for the first two Tests.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the first}} {{deliberate}} attack by any group targeting the British Army, which had not established defences against any form of assault. During the following day seventy suspects were rounded up, but no evidence of their involvement could be found. In response to the attack, the British imposed a road curfew from 18:00 to 06:00 each night and all cafes, restaurants and public entertainment venues in Tel Aviv were closed between 20:00 and 05:00. However this was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> {{some members of the}} division, who attacked Jewish houses in Qastina and Be'er Tuvia, injuring some of the occupants. Those involved were later punished by the British Army.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was downed at the Clemson 26-yard line, {{where the}} Tigers began their second {{offensive}} possession. It began {{no better than}} the first, as Dantzler was tackled for a three-yard loss by defensive tackle Lamar Cobb. A rush for no gain and a short pass forced Clemson to again punt before gaining a first down. Somaini's second punt was kicked cleanly, and the Hokies returned the punt to their 42-yard line. Two rushes and a pass to the 50-yard line were <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> a first down, and Tech punted to the Clemson 17-yard line.|$|E

On 7November 1916 he married Lovise Kristine Klausen, {{who worked as a}} {{waitress}} at a restaurant frequented by Andersen. They soon got an apartment at Torshov and had a son. Andersen got a better-paid job, laying the foundation for the headquarters of Oslo Lysverker, but when that job was done he had to seek day-to-day work at the harbour. After an upturn during the First World War, Norway's financial situation again turned for the worse, no-one would hire a man with an institutional background, and he was out of work. He made a last-ditch attempt to make money, buying liquor in Tønsberg and selling it on the black market in Kristiania, but this was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> his wife, who left him to pursue a more financially secure future.|$|E
