50|$|The {{malachite}} sunbird (<b>Nectarinia</b> <b>famosa)</b> {{is a small}} nectarivorous bird found from the highlands of Ethiopia southwards to South Africa.|$|E
5000|$|The {{flowers are}} fed at by {{a range of}} {{nectarivorous}} birds, mainly sunbirds and sugarbirds, including the orange-breasted sunbird (Anthobaphes violacea), southern double-collared sunbird (Cinnyris chalybeus), malachite sunbird (<b>Nectarinia</b> <b>famosa),</b> and the Cape sugarbird (Promerops cafer). In order to reach the nectar, the bird must push its bill into the inflorescence. As it does so, its bill and face gets brushed with pollen, thereby allowing for possible pollination.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMost of {{the species}} in the large African genus Kniphofia have floral traits that conform to the bird {{pollination}} syndrome, however there has been very little empirical work to confirm that birds are effective pollinators of Kniphofia species. From selective exclusion experiments, behavioural observations and pollen load analyses, we identified Amethyst Sunbirds (Chalcomitra amethystina) and Malachite Sunbirds (<b>Nectarinia</b> <b>famosa)</b> as the primary pollinators in two populations of Kniphofia laxiflora, with bees playing a smaller role. Bird visitors obtain moderate volumes (∼ 9 µl) of relatively concentrated (∼ 15 %) hexose-rich nectar in the flowers. This species is shown to be genetically self-incompatible, and thus reliant on pollinator visits for seed set. Although mountain pride butterflies (Aeropetes tulbaghia) {{have been identified as}} important pollinators of this species at two other populations, they did not occur at the two populations we studied...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMembers of the amaryllid genus Brunsvigia {{appear to}} show {{considerable}} variation in pollination syndromes, but experimental {{studies have been}} limited to two species, one pollinated by sunbirds and one by moths. Here we present {{the results of a}} simple exclusion experiment designed to shed light on the pollinators of the narrowly distributed species B. gregaria. Experimental flowers were left unbagged, or were bagged during night-time only, day-time only, or both day-time and night-time. Treatments started when flowers first matured and continued until senescence, after which we counted the number of fertile seeds per capsule. Flowers in treatment groups left open during the daytime produced significantly more seeds than flowers bagged during the daytime, whereas nocturnal bagging made little difference to seed number, indicating near-complete dependence on diurnal pollinators. Based on anecdotal observations we speculate that sunbirds — specifically <b>Nectarinia</b> <b>famosa</b> and possibly Cinnyris afer — are the most likely pollinators of B. gregaria...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{impacts of}} habitat {{fragmentation}} and reduced population sizes on ecological processes deserve more attention. In {{this study we}} examine pollination in rural and urban populations of Brunsvigia litoralis (Amaryllidaceae), an endangered endemic and a flagship species for plant conservation in South Africa. B. litoralis has flowers conforming to the bird-pollination syndrome, but the only flower visitor at the urban sites, the Greater Double-collared Sunbird (Cinnyris afra) (1. 6 visits/flower/hour), is unable to access the nectar in the usual way due to a long perianth tube (38. 8 mm) and resorts to robbing. Supplemental hand pollination {{was used to test}} for pollen limitation of seed set at the urban sites flowers were pollen-supplemented. Seed set in supplemented plants increased by more than an order of magnitude relative to controls. The longer-billed Malachite Sunbird (<b>Nectarinia</b> <b>famosa)</b> was observed as the sole pollinator of B. litoralis at the rural site where seed set was significantly higher. Although B. litoralis plants are long lived, the absence of pollinators in these urban fragments might place populations at an extinction risk...|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecent studies {{indicate}} that short-billed birds which visit flowers opportunistically for nectar are important pollinators of African plants and select for floral characteristics which are distinct from those found in sunbird-pollinated species. Here we report {{the existence of a}} pollination system involving opportunistic nectarivores in Kniphofia caulescens, a high altitude member of a genus previously considered to contain only sunbird- and insect-adapted pollination systems. Plants of K. caulescens set approximately twice as many fruits and produced more seeds per fruit when exposed to both bird and insect pollination than to just insect pollination. Controlled pollination experiments showed that the species is genetically self-incompatible and thus totally reliant on pollinator visits for seed set. Opportunistic nectar-feeding birds appear {{to be the most important}} pollinators of this plant. In particular, Drakensberg Siskins (Crithagra symonsi) and Yellow Canaries (Crithagra flaviventris) were the most frequent visitors and carried the highest pollen loads. The Malachite Sunbird (<b>Nectarinia</b> <b>famosa),</b> although often feeding on Kniphofia caulescens, carried very little pollen, presumably on account of its long bill which reduces contact between the floral anthers and its head feathers. Honey bees were also frequent flower visitors and made a secondary contribution to fruit set. Flowers of K. caulescens contained copious amounts (c. 30 µl) of very dilute (c. 9 %) hexose-rich nectar which is consistent with the pollination syndrome found in plants pollinated by opportunistic avian nectarivores...|$|E
40|$|ArticleUrbanization is a {{widespread}} and rapidly growing threat to biodiversity, therefore we need a predictive understanding of its effects on species and ecosystem processes. In this paper we study the impact of urbanization on a guild of nectar-feeding birds in a biodiversity hotspot at the Cape of Africa. The guild of four bird species provides important ecosystem services by pollinating 320 plant species in the Cape Floral Region. Functional diversity within the guild is related to differences in bill length. The long-billed Malachite Sunbird (<b>Nectarinia</b> <b>famosa)</b> plays an irreplaceable role as the exclusive pollinator of plant species with long nectar tubes. We analyzed {{the composition of the}} guild in suburban gardens of Cape Town along a gradient of increasing distance from the nearest natural habitat. Urbanization reduces the functional diversity of the nectarivore guild. Malachite Sunbirds did not penetrate more than 1 km into the city, whereas only the short-billed Southern Double-collared Sunbirds (Cinnyris chalybea) occurred throughout the urbanization gradient. The lack of data precludes conclusions regarding the detailed responses of Orange-breasted Sunbirds (Anthobaphes violacea) and Sugarbirds (Promerops cafer), however their absence across the entire gradient is suggestive of high sensitivity. The functional diversity of this guild of pollinators can potentially be restored, but {{the pros and cons of}} this conservation action need to be considered. © 2012 by the author(s) ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Aloe reitzii var.   reitzii is a {{succulent}} with {{a restricted}} {{distribution in the}} montane grassland of eastern South Africa. It is a summer (late January–March) flowering succulent that grows on rocky outcrops at 1000 m– 1600 m, and the conspicuous inflorescences suggest a pollination system focused towards birds. Objectives: To understand more about the pollination biology of  A. reitzii var.   reitzii. Methods: Nectar standing crop (flower volume and concentration) {{and the proportion of}} plants flowering were recorded. Camera traps and observations were used to record visitors to  A. reitzii var.   reitzii inflorescences. Results: Nectar volume was 36 μL ± 27 μL per flower (range 6 μL– 93 μL;  n = 27) and concentration was 16. 5 % ± 1. 7 % (range 13. 5 % – 19. 5 %). Camera trap observations, where 18. 9 % of all plants were observed flowering, recorded the three bird species Cape Weaver,  Ploceus capensis, Malachite Sunbird,  <b>Nectarinia</b> <b>famosa</b> and Greater Double-collared Sunbird,  Cinnyris afer (60. 4 %, 27. 1 % and 12. 5 % of plant visits, respectively) visiting inflorescences. Conclusion: Because birds are important pollinators for many  Aloe species, it is assumed that the bird species detected visiting  A. reitzii var.   reitzii are similarly important pollinators. At least 10 invertebrate species and sengi (Elephantulus sp.) were also recorded as visitors to flowers, but they may be less important pollinators than specialist and generalist avian nectarivores. This study provides further insight into the pollination biology of a diverse, and ecologically important, succulent genus in Africa...|$|E
40|$|A large {{diversity}} of floral morphological types exists within the bird pollination syndrome in the Cape Floral Region of South Africa. Here {{we focus on}} species with tubular flowers and ask: "Do differences in tube length among plant species correspond to differences in bill length among the birds that serve as pollinators?" To answer this question, we observed 1669 bird-plant interactions at thirteen bird-pollinated plant species across a spectrum of tube lengths. Only three nectar feeding bird species pollinated the focal plant species. The relatively short-billed species were the Southern Double-collared Sunbird (Cinnyris chalybea) and Orange-breasted Sunbird (Anthobaphes violacea); the only long-billed species was the Malachite Sunbird (<b>Nectarinia</b> <b>famosa).</b> We found that the groups of plant species pollinated by the long- and short-billed birds differed significantly in floral tube length. Short-billed sunbirds nevertheless often robbed long-tubed flowers by piercing the corolla, {{and there was a}} significant difference in floral tube length among those species that were robbed, and those that were pollinated by short-billed sunbirds. The presence of territorial Malachite Sunbirds depressed robbing rates by short-billed sunbirds at long-tubed flowers. In turn, the absence of Malachite Sunbirds from short-tubed plant species might be explained by the observed positive correlation between tube length and nectar volume. Together, these data suggest that there is a subset of the bird-pollinated plants at the Cape that are pollinated solely by the long-billed Malachite Sunbird, a pollination service irreplaceable by the more abundant, short-billed sunbird species. To extrapolate this finding to a greater subset of species in the Cape Floral Region, we measured flowers on herbarium specimens of all tubular putatively bird-pollinated plants. We find that floral tube length has a bimodal distribution with 37 Cape species potentially dependent on pollination by Malachite Sunbirds. © 2009 SAAB. Articl...|$|E
