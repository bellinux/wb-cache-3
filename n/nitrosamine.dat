25|$|Nitrosamines are a {{group of}} {{carcinogenic}} compounds found in cigarette smoke but not in uncured tobacco leaves. Nitrosamines form on flue-cured tobacco leaves during the curing process through a chemical reaction between nicotine and other compounds contained in the uncured leaf and various oxides of nitrogen found in all combustion gasses. Switching to Indirect fire curing {{has been shown to}} reduce <b>nitrosamine</b> levels to less than 0.1 parts per million.|$|E
25|$|Bacon is {{considered}} by many doctors to be unhealthy if eaten in excess. A study conducted by researchers at the University of Zurich found a connection between eating processed meat and the risk of dying from heart disease or cancer. Processed meats contain preservatives known as nitrates that, when absorbed by the human body, convert into <b>nitrosamine,</b> a chemical compound that could cause cancer. A second study by researchers at Columbia University found that the consumption of cured meats increase a person's chances of developing chronic pulmonary disease.|$|E

In none of the four football fields was there evidence of <b>nitrosamines</b> in the air above the field. Additional laboratory tests showed that <b>nitrosamines</b> could be set free from the material, but in small amounts only.

25|$|He {{contributed to}} {{studies on the}} {{carcinogenicity}} of 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide derivatives, the production of plant tumors by a <b>nitrosamine.</b> He also studied metabolism and protein binding of polynuclears {{and the effect of}} the binding o DNA replication and transcription, testing the effect of various carcinogens on the hatching of shrimp eggs. From the mid-1960s onwards, Bửu Hội increasingly turned his focus to the structural facets of polynuclears which determine their ability to induce microsomal enzyme synthesis, in particular involving zoxazolamine and dicoumarol hydroxylation. Aside from his study of fundamental organic chemistry, chemical carcinogenesis and chemotherapy of leprosy and tuberculosis, Bửu Hội's team also conducted research into {{a wide range of issues}} of biological and therapeutic interest. These included the synthesis and testing anti-inflammatory non-steroid compounds, substituted sex hormones, anti-coagulant substances and their potentiation, antidiabetic agents, treatment of hypertension by methyl-DOPA, antioxidants and the chemophylaxy of aging and the toxicity of dioxine among others.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the process}} of food preservation, {{potassium}} nitrate has been a common ingredient of salted meat since the Middle Ages, but its use has been mostly discontinued because of inconsistent results compared to more modern nitrate and nitrite compounds. Even so, saltpeter is still used in some food applications, such as charcuterie and the brine used to make corned beef. [...] When used as a food additive in the European Union, the compound {{is referred to as}} E252; it is also approved for use as a food additive in the USA and Australia and New Zealand (where it is listed under its INS number 252). Although nitrate salts have been suspected of producing the carcinogen <b>nitrosamine,</b> both sodium and potassium nitrates and nitrites have been added to meats in the US since 1925, and nitrates and nitrites have not been removed from preserved meat products because nitrite and nitrate inhibits the germination of Clostridium botulinum endospores, and thus prevents botulism form bacterial toxin that may otherwise be produced in certain preserved meat products.|$|E
2500|$|IPCC has {{provided}} estimates of air emissions from various CCS plant designs (see table below).

[...] "Functionalized Ammonia" [...] emit less ammonia, but amines may form secondary amines and these will emit volatile nitrosamines by a side reaction with nitrogendioxide, which is present in any flue gas even after DeNOx. Nevertheless, there are advanced amines in testing with little to no vapor pressure to avoid these amine- and consecutive <b>nitrosamine</b> emissions. Nevertheless, all the capture plants amines have in common, that practically 100% of remaining sulfur dioxide from the plant is washed out of the flue gas, {{the same applies to}} dust/ash.|$|E

40|$|AbstractProcesses of post {{combustion}} CO 2 capture using amine based solvents generate nitrogenous compounds. Among these products, carcinogenic <b>nitrosamines</b> are {{of great}} concern due the potential impacts {{on the environment and}} human health. Trace analysis of <b>nitrosamines</b> in simple matrices such as water is well described in standard methods [1]. However, measuring <b>nitrosamines</b> in CO 2 capture processes emissions is much more challenging. <b>Nitrosamines,</b> formed to small concentrations as solvent degradation products, may indeed be present in solvent, wash waters, and atmospheric emissions which are more complicated to monitor. Within the FP 7 OCTAVIUS project, 2 international round robins on the analysis of 9 <b>nitrosamines</b> in solvent matrices and the atmospheric emissions, from the EnBW CO 2 capture pilot plant in Heilbronn (Germany) were organized. The first round robin test was performed on solvent matrices. The analytical methods of the laboratories involved were compared using synthetic spiked samples and liquid samples obtained from the pilot plant. The second round robin test was performed on atmospheric emissions collected using a sampling train with cold impingers filled in with sulphamic acid in water. Each laboratory was provided with two blind samples of the liquid mixture spiked at different levels of concentrations of <b>nitrosamines...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{biological}} toxities of <b>nitrosamines,</b> the effects of <b>nitrosamines</b> on the biological membrane, especially on the energy transfer reaction and on the K(+) compartmentation of mitochondria were examined. The results obtained were as follows; 1) DPNA and DBNA uncoupled the oxidative phosphorylation of rat liver mitochondria at the low concentration (about 0. 2 mM solution). 2) Uncoupling activities of DPNA and DBNA to the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation were increased {{in accordance with the}} increase in concentration and showed a remarkable increase within the concentration range from 0. 1 mM to 0. 2 mM solution. 3) The release of K(+) from mitochondria was induced by treatment with DPNA or DBNA, especially was accelerated by DPNA. However, it could not be induced by treatment of 1 mM DMNA or DENA. 4) The order of K(+) -release intensity induced by <b>nitrosamines</b> was corresponding to that of uncoupling activities of <b>nitrosamines.</b> 5) In conclusion, it was recognized that the functions of mitochondrial membrane were damaged by <b>nitrosamines</b> and their injurious effects were influenced by their chemical structures in the order of DPNA, DBNA, DENA and DMNA. This suggests that <b>nitrosamines</b> may have injurious effects on the function of the biological membrane, as well as their already recognized effects of carcinogenecity or liver injury (liver cirrhosis) ...|$|R
