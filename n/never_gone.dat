5|$|Australia's {{prospects}} improved after Sweden was disqualified in {{the morning}} heats. Tonelli, the eldest swimmer in the quartet {{at the age of}} 23, convened the team as its de facto leader. He asked his teammates to commit to swimming their legs in a certain time; Kerry vowed to complete the backstroke in 57s, Evans the breaststroke in 63s flat, Tonelli the butterfly in 54s and Brooks promised to anchor the team in 49.8s, even though he had <b>never</b> <b>gone</b> faster than 51s. Tonelli named the foursome the Quietly Confident Quartet, and they exhibited a calm self-belief as they lined up for the race.|$|E
5|$|Crane's {{contract}} with Appleton {{allowed him to}} receive a flat ten percent royalty of all copies sold. However, the contract also stipulated {{that he was not}} to receive royalties from the books sold in Great Britain, where they were released by Heinemann in early 1896 as part of its Pioneer Series. In 1982, W. W. Norton & Company published a version of the novel based on Crane's original 1894 manuscript of 55,000 words. Edited by Henry Binder, this version is questioned by those who believe Crane made the original edits for the 1895 Appleton edition on his own accord. Since its initial publication, the novel has <b>never</b> <b>gone</b> out of print.|$|E

5|$|Homer, having {{forgotten}} Marge's birthday, rushes {{out to buy}} her {{a present}} at the Springfield Mall. He finds a bowling ball and decides to buy it for her. During the night of her birthday dinner at the Singing Sirloin, Marge is happy with the kids' presents of French perfume from Bart and a macaroni and glue card of her as the Mona Lisa from Lisa. However, she is offended by Homer's gift as it is another demonstration of his thoughtless gift giving history, which her sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier had reminded her of earlier. To make matters worse, as he presents his 'gift', it bursts through its box and squashes Marge's birthday cake. Deeply resentful, Marge reminds him that not only has she <b>never</b> <b>gone</b> bowling in her life, but the ball is also inscribed with his name.|$|E
5|$|The 4100m medley relay was {{the focal}} point of Brooks' Moscow {{campaign}} and it came only two days before his 18th birthday. The event had always been won by the United States since its inception at Olympic level in 1960, and their boycott had opened up the field in the event. In the five times the event had been contested, Australia's best result was a silver in the inaugural race. A bronze in 1964 was the only other medal success and the 1976 edition of the medley relay had seen Australia eliminated in the heats. This time, Australia were regarded as a medal chance, but were not seen as the main threats; Sweden, Great Britain and the Soviet Union were the most heavily fancied teams. The hosts boasted the silver medallists in the 100m backstroke and breaststroke, and their butterflyer had come fifth; their freestyler would place fourth a few days later. The British had Duncan Goodhew, the breaststroke gold medallist, while Sweden's butterflyer and backstroker had won their respective events and their freestyle swimmer would come second in the 100m. On paper, Australia's team paled in comparison. Peter Evans was the only individual medallist over a 100m race, claiming bronze in the breaststroke. Mark Kerry had been eliminated in the backstroke semifinals, while Tonelli was swimming as a makeshift butterflyer, despite having performed better than Kerry in the 100m backstroke. Adding to the pressure was the fact that Australia won no gold medals at the 1976 Olympics in any sport, and were yet to win in Moscow, so the public were still awaiting their first victory since Munich in 1972. Coming into the Olympics, Australia were ranked seventh out of the thirteen competing countries. Australia's prospects improved after the morning heats in which Sweden was disqualified. Tonelli, the eldest swimmer in the quartet at the age of 23, convened the team as its de facto leader. He asked his team-mates to commit to swimming their legs in a certain time; Kerry vowed to swim the backstroke in 57s, Evans the breaststroke in 63s flat, Tonelli the butterfly in 54s and Brooks promised to anchor the team in 49.8s, even though he had <b>never</b> <b>gone</b> faster than 51s. Tonelli named the foursome as the Quietly Confident Quartet, and they exhibited a quiet confidence as they lined up for the race.|$|E

25|$|The {{wide range}} of {{possibilities}} (including impossibility) of interpretation of monochrome paintings is arguably why the monochrome is so engaging to so many artists, critics, and writers.
