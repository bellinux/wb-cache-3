The Great Artiste and <b>Necessary</b> <b>Evil</b> followed at short intervals. Several hundred people, including journalists and photographers, had gathered {{to watch the}} planes return.

5|$|Both commanders were {{a product}} of the {{environment}} of European warfare, which generally took place in open fields with relatively easy mobility, and were thus uncomfortable with woodland warfare. Neither liked the irregular warfare practiced by the Indians and British counterparts like Rogers' Rangers, but saw them as a <b>necessary</b> <b>evil,</b> given the operating environment. Although the French depended on Indian support to increase their comparatively small numbers throughout the war, Indian forces were quite low in this battle, and Montcalm generally disliked them and their practices.|$|E
5|$|Hiroshima was {{the primary}} target of the first nuclear bombing mission on August 6, with Kokura and Nagasaki as {{alternative}} targets. Having been fully briefed {{under the terms of}} Operations Order No. 35, the 393d Bombardment Squadron B-29 Enola Gay, piloted by Tibbets, took off from North Field, Tinian, about six hours' flight time from Japan. The Enola Gay (named after Tibbets' mother) was accompanied by two other B-29s. The Great Artiste, commanded by Major Charles Sweeney, carried instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called <b>Necessary</b> <b>Evil,</b> commanded by Captain George Marquardt, served as the photography aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Hiroshima was {{the primary}} target of the first nuclear bombing mission on 6 August, with Kokura and Nagasaki as {{alternative}} targets. Enola Gay, piloted by Tibbets, took off from North Field, in the Mariana Islands, about six hours' flight time from Japan, accompanied by two other B-29s, The Great Artiste, carrying instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called <b>Necessary</b> <b>Evil,</b> commanded by Captain George Marquardt, to take photographs. The director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., wanted the event recorded for posterity, so the takeoff was illuminated by floodlights. When he wanted to taxi, Tibbets leaned {{out the window to}} direct the bystanders out of the way. On request, he gave a friendly wave for the cameras.|$|E
5|$|Historians Félix Luna, Miguel Angel de Marco and Fernando Rocchi all {{praise the}} role of Raúl Alfonsín in the {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War and the restoration of democracy. Luna also considers that Alfonsín was an effective president, and that he set an example of not using the state for personal gain. De Marco points out that it was a delicate time period, and any mistake could have endangered the newly founded democracy and led to another coup. The aforementioned historians do not agree, though, on their view of the Pact of Olivos. Luna considers that it was a <b>necessary</b> <b>evil</b> to prevent the chaos that would have been generated if Menem managed to proceed with the constitutional amendment without negotiating with the UCR. De Marco and Rocchi instead believe that it was the biggest mistake of Alfonsín's political career.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these small}} reforms, the 18th century ended with {{continuous}} and unrestrained {{attacks on the}} Court. Although complaints had been common {{since the time of}} Elizabeth I, the problems had become more unrestrained, {{at the same time as}} politically neutral law reformers first arose in any great number. Many critics were barristers of the common law, ignorant of the court's workings, but some, such as Sir Samuel Romilly, had trained as a Chancery advocate and were well aware of the Chancery's procedure. The success of the Code Napoleon and the writings of Jeremy Bentham are seen by academic Duncan Kerly to have had much to do with the criticism, and the growing wealth of the country and increasing international trade meant it was crucial that there be a functioning court system for matters of equity. While the upper classes had been struggling with the Court for centuries, and regarded it as a <b>necessary</b> <b>evil,</b> the growing middle and merchant classes were more demanding. With increasing court backlogs, it was clear to many law reformers and politicians that serious reform was needed.|$|E

40|$|The {{prevailing}} {{approach to}} studying {{justice in the}} workplace {{has been focused on}} recipients and even observers of fairness. This approach, however, fails to consider the experience of other parties who might be affected by justice, including those that must deliver it. In order to understand the experience of deliverers, I investigated how delivering justice, injustice, and <b>necessary</b> <b>evils</b> affect their emotions, stress, and subsequent behaviors. I also assessed the extent to which situational features would ameliorate or exacerbate deliverers’ affective and physiological responses. Two experiments showed that deliverers’ emotions and stress were affected by their delivery experience, such that those who had to deliver injustice and <b>necessary</b> <b>evils</b> were generally less happy, and more guilty, sad, and stressed than those who had to deliver justice. While there was no effect on behaviors nor was there a mitigating effect of situation, these findings suggest that, in addition to recipients and observers, deliverers also respond to justice as they deliver it. ...|$|R

25|$|Mackenzie served {{concurrently}} as Minister of Public Works and {{oversaw the}} completion of the Parliament Buildings.

Proving Dufferin's reflections on his character to be true, Mackenzie disliked intensely the patronage inherent in politics. Nevertheless, he found it a <b>necessary</b> <b>evil</b> in order to maintain party unity and ensure the loyalty of his fellow Liberals.|$|E
25|$|As shock policy, {{the term}} was coined by {{economist}} Milton Friedman. In time, it became absorbed into the group of ideas about economics, that are {{sometimes referred to as}} neoliberalism. The economist Jeffrey Sachs coined the expression of shock therapy. The alleged difference between the two shock expressions lies only in the degree of economic liberalisation. Sachs' ideas were based on studying historic periods of monetary and economic crisis and noting that a decisive stroke could end monetary chaos, often in a day. Whereas, Sachs' shock therapy notion views liberalisation as a <b>necessary</b> <b>evil,</b> a fast—as well as nasty—way to achieve economic stabilisation.|$|E
25|$|White Spanish and Cuban criollos saw cabildos as a <b>necessary</b> <b>evil.</b> By the 18th century, these {{spaces of}} {{cultural}} autonomy and support {{began to worry}} slaves' white masters. Articles of the 1792 Bando de Buen Gobierno y Policia address the necessity of controlling the cabildos and their members. Neighbors often complained about the unpleasant noises made by the slaves as they sang and played African instruments. By the 19th century, cabildos were re-located outside {{the walls of the}} city of Havana so that whites would not have to see or hear their African celebrations. For the Afro-Cubans, this expulsion added a degree of privacy that they had previously lacked.|$|E

40|$|In 1955, in a {{neglected}} {{article in the}} Harvard Law Review entitled Freedom—A Suggested Analysis, Lon L. Fuller provided a framework for the basic definition of freedom. More importantly, he tendered {{a question about the}} conditions of a free society: “How can the freedom of human beings be affected or advanced by social arrangements, that is, by laws, customs, institutions, or other forms of social order that can be changed or preserved by purposive human actions?” This is the critical question this Article addresses through constructing a comprehensive definition by first, considering etymology and then establishing the various modalities in which freedom operates. These modalities include the space defined by {{the rule of law and}} various antithetical non-rule-of-law states, the role of democracy and representative government in disparate levels of society, the importance of rights as trumps on power, and the challenges posed by social justice. Finally, Fuller’s question raises the issue of “laws, customs, institutions [and] other forms of social order,” all of which luminaries such as John Stuart Mill saw as unfortunate, but <b>necessary,</b> <b>evils</b> when considering freedom. Rather than <b>necessary</b> <b>evils,</b> this article will consider the productive role ascribed to law and institutions by Scott Shapiro, who views law as a form of social planning that effectuates choices, thus enhancing freedom...|$|R

25|$|Given the Singapore government's {{focus on}} efficiency, {{the country has}} been said to {{emphasize}} a largely green-light approach towards administrative law. Public administration is not seen as a <b>necessary</b> <b>evil</b> but a positive attribute, and the objective of administrative law is not primarily to stop bad administrative practices but to encourage good ones. In this approach, recourse to the judiciary is not the first line of defence against administrative abuses of powers. Instead, it is perceived that control can and should come internally from Parliament and the executive itself in upholding high standards of public administration and policy. In other words, instead of redressing bad government through the courts, good government should be sought through the political process and public avenues. Courts play a supporting role by articulating clear rules and principles by which the Singapore government may abide and conform to the rule of law.|$|E
25|$|Even though {{women in}} {{fundamentalist}} groups are often expected to rear children and other domestic tasks, {{it is not}} accurate to assume that all women in polygamous relationships in Mormon fundamentalist groups are powerless. Mormon women in fundamentalist groups experience their gender roles differently than women in the LDS church. In fundamentalists sects, sex {{is viewed as a}} <b>necessary</b> <b>evil</b> for reproduction. Women who are menstruating, lactating, or pregnant are not expected to have sex with their husbands. One fundamentalist women said that because her husband had other wives, she didn't feel pressured to sexually satisfy her husband. Fundamentalist women help their husbands seek other wives, and many say that for their husbands to look for a wife without consulting existing wives would be akin to infidelity. Some wives in polygamous marriages feel closer to their sister wives than to their husbands. In some polygamous relationships, a wife nurtures her husband's relationship with his other wives by encouraging her husband to spend time with them. Sister wives help each other with childrearing, cooking, and other domestic tasks. Women in polygamous relationships have their own bedrooms, while their husbands are treated as visitors. Sister wives also often control the household's finances. The studies that examined the experience of fundamentalist women did not examine underage marriage, which the authors felt was a separate issue. The 2008 police raid of the FLDS Texas compound found that 12 girls were married before age 16 and sexually abused.|$|E

He states that as a result, societies should strengthen their democratic institutions to keep these <b>necessary</b> <b>evils</b> from becoming as offensive to freedom and democracy as the threats they are meant to prevent.

40|$|The {{existence}} of inequalities among {{the population of}} all free-market economies has led to investigations of the location of social problems. Many of these problems are concentrated in large cities, which places are also believed to generate many of the benefits considered vital to continued economic growth. Measurement and evaluation of {{the costs and benefits}} of cities of various sizes is thus important for the derivation of policies which will minimise costs and maximise benefits. With regard to measurement, this paper argues that costs are not properly accounted for, and a method of doing this is suggested. With regard to evaluation, I argue against liberal economists who see costs as <b>necessary</b> <b>evils</b> to be countered by price mechanisms and, as a consequence, inequalities. ...|$|R
