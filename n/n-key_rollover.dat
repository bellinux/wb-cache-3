5000|$|A <b>n-key</b> <b>rollover</b> {{mechanical}} keyboard {{integrated into}} the computer case ...|$|E
5000|$|The two {{operating}} {{modes of}} keyboard section are 2-key lockout and <b>N-key</b> <b>rollover.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In the <b>N-key</b> <b>rollover</b> mode, {{simultaneous}} {{keys are}} recognized and their codes {{are stored in}} FIFO.|$|E
50|$|Most music {{keyboards}} use isolation diodes {{in their}} keyboard matrix to implement full <b>n-key</b> <b>rollover</b> (sometimes abbreviated NKRO), making them immune to both key ghosting and key jamming.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the user}} to get {{the benefit of the}} full <b>n-key</b> <b>rollover,</b> the {{complete}} key press status must be transmitted to the computer. When the data is sent via the USB protocol, there are two operating modes: Human Interface Device (HID) [...] "report protocol" [...] and [...] "boot protocol". The boot protocol, which is enabled on boot, is limited to 8 modifier keys (left and right versions of Ctrl, Shift, Alt, and Win), followed by maximum 6 key codes. This will limit the amount of simultaneous key presses that can be reported. To get full <b>n-key</b> <b>rollover,</b> HID report protocol must be implemented on both keyboard and computer.|$|E
50|$|As {{the first}} decade of the 21st century progressed, the legacy-free PC went mainstream, with legacy ports removed from {{commonly}} available computer systems in all form factors. However the PS/2 keyboard connector remains in widespread use, as it offers some advantages (e.g. easier implementation of <b>N-Key</b> <b>rollover)</b> over the USB.|$|E
50|$|The {{capacitive}} {{design is}} widely considered superior {{to that of the}} later membrane design used on the Model M. It has a lighter actuation force of about 60g, a crisper feel and louder feedback, and is more robust. It also has a higher MTBF of over 100 million keypresses, and full <b>n-key</b> <b>rollover.</b>|$|E
5000|$|High-end {{keyboards}} {{that provide}} full <b>n-key</b> <b>rollover</b> typically do so via a PS/2 interface as, though USB HID keyboards support full rollover, some operating systems do not promote USB HID boot keyboards, which can report only {{a maximum of}} six pressed keys (excluding modifiers) at a time. This hinders fast typists, as well as users who depend on unusual hotkeys to be recognized by special software (for example, for system development purposes) or seek to use alternative input methods like Braille or chorded input.|$|E
50|$|The above {{described}} {{behavior is}} in contrast to the PS/2 interface, which supports <b>n-key</b> <b>rollover</b> (NKRO) for keyboards capable of supporting NKRO. The PS/2 interface does not interrupt the CPU at all when there are no state changes except when a key is held long enough to activate typematic, which causes the keyboard to repeatedly send the scan codes for the keys held down long enough in order to cause the keys to repeat themselves. This behavior of not having to respond to repeated polling saves power, so the PS/2 interface is often used in laptops' internal keyboards.|$|E
50|$|The player {{controls}} a beam {{of light}} which is capable of moving up, down, left or right. The objective is to avoid hitting anything while forcing your opponents' beams to crash into yours, their own, or a wall. After a set amount of time, the walls begin to close in, making survival more difficult and forcing players closer together. The winner of each round is the last surviving beam and points are awarded based on how long each beam survived. After a few rounds, the player with the highest score wins the game. The game supports a maximum of 4 players, either human or computer controlled (which can be set to either Novice or Expert level). However, since the game could be played with 4 humans at the same time on the same keyboard, it was prone to the <b>N-key</b> <b>rollover</b> problem.|$|E
