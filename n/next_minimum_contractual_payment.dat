Cilj rada je ispitati postiže li se uređenjem sadržanim u Direktivi prikladna razina zaštite vjerovnika novčanih obveza od negativnih učinaka zakašnjenja s plaćanjem te ocijeniti je li intenzitet intervencije u slobodu ugovaranja primjeren ciljevima koji se Direktivom nastoje ostvariti.

The paper {{presents}} {{the provisions of}} Directive 2011 / 7 /EU on combating late payment in commercial transactions by virtue of which the EU Member States are obliged to limit the contractual freedom in contracts between undertakings. The Directive’s rules on the <b>contractual</b> <b>payment</b> period of 60 calendar days and on the exceptionally longer <b>contractual</b> <b>payment</b> period, {{as well as on}} payment schedules providing for instalments, are also analysed. The author argues the position that, if the payment period is not fixed in the contract but the contract stipulates that the determination of the payment period is left to the will of one of the contracting parties, then such unilaterally decided payment period should be considered as the payment period fixed in the contract {{in the sense of the}} provisions of Directive 2011 / 7 /EU. The same solution should be applied when the payment period is determined through commercial customs or practice established between undertakings. As one of the possible improvements of the legal regime established by the Directive, the author proposes a restriction of the contractual freedom of undertakings regarding the stipulation of the date of commencement of <b>contractual</b> <b>payment</b> period in order to prevent potential abuse of freedom of contract...|$|R

The ordinary least square technique is used to detect efficiency of financial leverage of 154 textile firms in Pakistan over the period 2006 - 2011. The regression results indicate that leverage has s negative association with the efficiency of firms. Financial leverage is negatively associated with return of assets and equity, which shows that firms borrow less, while market-to-book ratio shows positive profitable association with firms. Consequently firms tend to borrow more and pay their <b>contractual</b> <b>payments</b> in time...|$|R

The mitigation of typical problems of contractor selection, motivation and risk sharing between client and contractor are examined {{in the context of}} cost plus fixed fee contracts, firm fixed price contracts, and incentive contracts. The latter offer possible solutions to the widely acknowledged difficulties with cost plus fixed fee contracts and firm fixed price contracts. However, there are other difficulties with operating incentive contracts in practice, and these are considered in the paper. <br/...|$|R

Fluctuating earnings and fixed obligations of payment embody a risk of illiquidity which might lead to bankruptcy. According to the principal/agency-approach, different capital structures might therefore lead to different streams of earnings.

Furthermore, we state and prove a verification theorem and obtain a fairly explicit solution {{that leads to a}} characterization of optimal strategies, indicating that some widely used redistribution schemes are suboptimal...|$|R
50|$|For a fully amortizing loan, with a fixed (i.e., non-variable) {{interest}} rate, {{the payment}} {{remains the same}} throughout the term, regardless of principal balance owed. For example, the payment on the above scenario will remain $733.76 {{regardless of whether the}} outstanding (unpaid) principal balance is $100,000 or $50,000. Paying down more than the monthly contractual amount reduces the amount outstanding and thus the interest that is payable to the lender; if the <b>contractual</b> monthly <b>payment</b> stays the same, the number of payments and the term of the loan must decrease. Conversely, paying down less than the monthly contractual amount increases the amount outstanding and thus the interest payable (negative amortization); if the <b>contractual</b> monthly <b>payment</b> stays the same, the number of payments and the term of the loan must increase.|$|R

40|$|Though {{there are}} several {{theoretical}} lease pricing models, {{they have not been}} systematically estimated or tested using real data. The existing empirical literature on leases typically tries to explain one period’s lease payment, ignoring how fast those payments are scheduled to grow, or whether the lease contains option features. This paper bridges the gap between the two literatures by providing the first empirical investigation of an internally consistent lease pricing model. We develop a no-arbitrage based valuation model that allows us to calculate each lease’s NPV taking into account both the <b>contractual</b> <b>payment</b> amounts and any embedded options. Using a proprietary data set of several hundred leases from suburban malls in 11 states, we then compare the NPV of each lease with various characteristics of the leases and underlying properties, to see what characteristics are important, and how the underlying valuation model can be improved...|$|R

While the policyholder can "hold up" the insurer for extra <b>contractual</b> <b>payments,</b> the continuing gains from trade {{on a single}} contract are often too small to yield useful coverage. By acting as a repository of the reputations of the parties, we show the brokers provide a coordinating mechanism to leverage the collective hold up power of policyholders. This extends both the degree of implicit and explicit coverage. The role {{is reflected in the}} terms of broker engagement, specifically in the ownership by the broker of the renewal rights. Finally, we argue that brokers can be motivated to play this role when they receive commissions that are contingent on insurer profits.

40|$|The {{construction}} industry in Ghana, {{like many others}} worldwide, has had {{its fair share of}} damning independent reviews. Huge and unsustainable foreign debt, excessive budget deficits, huge <b>contractual</b> <b>payment</b> arrears, poor construction performance, corruption and pressure from international financial institutions, forced the government to commit to a reform of public procurement, which culminated in the passing of the Public Procurement Act, 2003 (Act 663). The paper outlines the events leading to, and features of, the public procurement reform in Ghana and analyses its potential impact and the unique challenges it presents. Comparisons are also drawn from relevant scenarios in other countries. The paper concludes that while the Procurement Act sets out the legal, institutional and regulatory framework to secure fiscal transparency and public accountability, the sole reliance on traditional contracting and price-based selection limits the scope for the value for money achievable. Expanding the reforms to cover procurement and project delivery methods and strategies, with a focus on ‘best value’, will increase the potential and likelihood of achieving value for money in public construction in Ghana. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
