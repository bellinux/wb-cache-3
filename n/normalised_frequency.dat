40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} TCR beta {{repertoire}} of peripheral blood CD 8 enriched (CD 8 +) and depleted (CD 8 -) T cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and controls using CDR 3 length analysis (spectratyping). METHODS: CD 8 + and CD 8 - T cells were separated from 14 RA patients and 12 controls, using magnetic beads coated with anti-CD 8 monoclonal antibodies. cDNA was prepared as the template for amplification with 22 V beta-C beta primer pairs. The products {{were resolved by}} electrophoresis in an ABI 373 sequencer using GENESCAN software. Expansions were identified as dominant CDR 3 lengths, where the area underlying the corresponding peak exceeded {{the sum of the}} areas of the two adjacent peaks. This method was validated by sequencing 10 samples displaying dominant peaks. The expansion frequencies in RA patients and controls were compared using the chi 2 test statistic. RESULTS: Dominant peaks were evident in several V beta families. They were more frequent in RA patients in both the CD 8 + subset (RA <b>normalised</b> <b>frequency</b> 10. 6; control <b>normalised</b> <b>frequency</b> 8. 0; p = 0. 03) and the CD 8 - subset (RA <b>normalised</b> <b>frequency</b> 2. 9; control <b>normalised</b> <b>frequency</b> 1. 5; p = 0. 02). Sequencing of 10 samples exhibiting dominant peaks revealed an unequivocal clonal expansion in nine (90 %). CONCLUSIONS: RA patients exhibited a significantly increased frequency of T cell expansions both in the CD 8 + and CD 8 - subsets. This phenomenon may reflect the proliferation of autoreactive cells, a nonspecific expansion of memory T cells in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines or a defect of T cell regulation that predates the onset of RA and may itself predipose to disease...|$|E

Extensive research by many scientists lead to the standardized calculation model for pure tone air absorption.

As a result, several parameters and units are used for the same phenomenon. However, air absorption is calculated for pure tones, while room acoustics calculations are performed in frequency bands. Most computer models use the centre-frequency of the <b>normalised</b> <b>frequency</b> bands to calculate the air absorption by the pure tone method. Reverberation measurements in frequency bands under laboratory and practical conditions show that errors larger than the Just Noticeable Difference result in calculating the air absorption by this ‘centre-frequency method’.

Since recent low-Reynolds-number numerical work suggests that rotation can enhance or suppress the natural oscillatory response, the former could find applications in energy harvesting and the latter in vibration control. The present experimental investigation characterises the dynamic response and wake structure of a rotating circular cylinder undergoing vortex-induced vibration at a low mass ratio (m∗ = 5. 78) over the reduced velocity range leading to strong oscillations. The experiments were conducted in a free-surface water channel with the cylinder vertically mounted and attached to a motor that provided constant rotation. Springs and an air-bearing system allow the cylinder to undertake low-damped transverse oscillations. Under cylinder rotation, the <b>normalised</b> <b>frequency</b> response was found to be comparable to that of a freely vibrating non-rotating cylinder. At reduced velocities consistent with the upper branch of a non-rotating transversely oscillating cylinder, the maximum oscillation amplitude increased with non-dimensional rotation rate up to α ≈ 2.

Notably, this critical value corresponds approximately to the rotation rate at which vortex shedding ceases for a non-oscillating rotating cylinder. Remarkably, at α = 2 there was approximately an 80 % increase in the peak amplitude response compared to that of a non-rotating cylinder.

40|$|The {{availability}} of unique variable (V H), diversity (D), and joining (J H) gene segments in the vertebrate germline determines {{the extent to}} which a primary immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoire can be generated through combinatorial rearrangement. Although bovine D segments possess unusual properties, the diversity of the primary Ig heavy chain (IgH) repertoire in cattle is restricted by the dominance of a single family of germline V H genes of limited number and diversity. Cattle therefore must employ other diversification strategies in order to generate a functional IgH repertoire, the main candidates being gene conversion and somatic hypermutation. In considering these possibilities, we predicted that if somatic hypermutation was active during B lymphocyte development, the process would introduce nucleotide substitutions to the VDJ exon and also non-coding region lying downstream of the rearranged J H segment. In contrast, our expectation was that gene conversion would show a greater tendency to confine modification to the IgH coding sequence, leaving intron regions substantially unmodified. An analysis of rearranged IgH sequences from cattle of different ages revealed that the diversification of germline sequences could be observed in very young calves and that substitution frequency increased with age. The age-dependent accumulation of mutations was particularly apparent in the second IgH complementarity-determining region (CDR 2). Single base substitutions were found to predominate, with purines targeted more frequently than pyrimidines and transitions favoured over transversions. In non-coding regions, mutations were detected at a <b>normalised</b> <b>frequency</b> that was indistinguishable from that observed in CDR 2.

40|$|Transmitter {{power control}} is an {{effective}} scheme to improve the performance of cellular DS/CDMA systems. In the reverse link, pilot symbols are used to assist the estimation of received signal power {{in order to improve}} the performance of power control. In this paper, we propose a model for the evaluation of the performance of a power-controlled reverse link CDMA system in the presence of Rayleigh flat fading. The model allows analysis of design parameters such as the number of pilot symbols, the power control updating frequency and the maximum allowable transmitted power. Analysis result shows that when transmitter power control is used, system capacity can be increased by more than 40 % for typical <b>normalised</b> Doppler <b>frequency</b> in cellular communications...|$|R
