5|$|Cumings, and {{simultaneously}} the New Zealand <b>neurologist</b> Derek Denny-Brown, {{working in the}} United States, first reported effective treatment with metal chelator British anti-Lewisite in 1951.

The first effective oral chelation agent, penicillamine, was discovered in 1956 by British <b>neurologist</b> John Walshe. In 1982, Walshe also introduced trientine, and was the first to develop tetrathiomolybdate for clinical use. Zinc acetate therapy initially made its appearance in the Netherlands, where physicians Schouwink and Hoogenraad used it in 1961 and in the 1970s, respectively, but it was further developed later by Brewer and colleagues at the University of Michigan.|$|E
40|$|In Peru, {{despite a}} strong {{clinical}} research infrastructure in Lima, and Masters degree programs in epidemiology at three universities, few <b>neurologists</b> participate in clinical research. It was our objective to identify perceived needs {{and opportunities for}} increasing clinical research capacity and training opportunities for Peruvian <b>neurologists.</b> We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional survey of Peruvian <b>neurologists</b> in Lima and Arequipa, Peru. Forty-eight <b>neurologists</b> completed written surveys and oral interviews. All <b>neurologists</b> reported interest in clinical research, but noted that lack of time and financial resources limited their ability to participate. Although most <b>neurologists</b> had received some training in epidemiology and research design as medical students or residents, the majority felt these topics were not adequately covered. <b>Neurologists</b> in Arequipa noted international funding for clinical research was uncommon outside {{the capital city of}} Lima. We concluded that clinical research is important to Peruvian <b>neurologists.</b> The three main barriers to increased participation in clinical research identified by <b>neurologists</b> were insufficient training in clinical research methodology, meager funding opportunities, and lack of dedicated time to participate in clinical research.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} where <b>neurologists</b> look when they view brain computed tomography (CT) images and to evaluate how they deploy their visual attention by comparing their gaze distribution with saliency maps. Brain CT images showing cerebrovascular accidents were presented to 12 <b>neurologists</b> and 12 control subjects. The subjects' ocular fixation positions were recorded using an eye-tracking device (Eyelink 1000). Heat maps were created based on the eye-fixation patterns of each group and compared between the two groups. The heat maps revealed that the areas on which control subjects frequently fixated often coincided with areas identified as outstanding in saliency maps, while the areas on which <b>neurologists</b> frequently fixated often did not. Dwell time in regions of interest (ROI) was likewise compared between the two groups, revealing that, although dwell time on large lesions was not different between the two groups, dwell time in clinically important areas with low salience was longer in <b>neurologists</b> than in controls. Therefore it appears that <b>neurologists</b> intentionally scan clinically important areas when reading brain CT images showing cerebrovascular accidents.

In the beginning of 2010 there were 1310 physicians in Hungary with an of-fi cial license to practice neurology. During 2009, neurological performance at least once during the year was claimed to the National Health Insurance Fund by 948 board certifi ed <b>neurologists.</b> The number of those <b>neurologists</b> who are routinely involved in neurological patient care {{was estimated to be}} around 750. The lack of the young generation is characteristic for the age distribution of <b>neurologists.</b> In 9 out of the 19 counties of Hungary, the number of <b>neurologists</b> below the age of 35 is 1 or zero. In the ten-year period of 2000 - 2009, the annual mean number of new board certifi cations in neurology was 22.

40|$|BACKGROUND The {{adherence}} to treatment with injectable disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) in multiple sclerosis (MS) {{may benefit from}} adequate information provision and management of expectations. The communication between patients and physicians {{is very important in}} this respect. The current study investigated the perspectives and experiences of the MS patients and <b>neurologists</b> concerning the choice and course of treatment with DMDs in the Netherlands. METHODS The MS patients (aged 18 - 60 years; diagnosed with MS at least a year ago, currently treated with injectable DMD treatment) and MS-specialized <b>neurologists</b> (practicing for ≥ 3 years, treating ≥ 15 MS patients/month on average, and spending > 60 % of their time in clinical practice) were asked to complete semistructured Internet-based questionnaires. The <b>neurologists</b> in this study were not necessarily the treating <b>neurologists</b> of the participating MS patients. RESULTS In all, 107 MS patients and 18 MS-specialized <b>neurologists</b> completed the questionnaires. The MS-specialized <b>neurologists</b> in this study reported discussing most of the suggested treatment goals with their patients. The MS patients indicated that certain important treatment goals, ie, reduction in disease progression, reduction or prolongation of time to long-term disability, and reduction in new magnetic resonance imaging lesions, were not discussed with them. More than one-quarter of the patients (27 %) would appreciate more information about their treatment. We found evidence for suboptimal patient {{adherence to}} MS therapy (23 % indicated taking a treatment break) due to diverse side effects, lack of efficacy, or practical issues. As compared to these patient reports, the scale of poor adherence was overestimated by {{more than half of the}} <b>neurologists</b> (on average, 30 % estimated treatment breaks). CONCLUSION The MS patients and MS-specialized <b>neurologists</b> in this study differ in their experiences and perspectives on information provision and adherence to DMDs. Education programs and up-to-date information on MS treatments for both <b>neurologists</b> and patients may be helpful in improving patient involvement and patient-physician communication...|$|R

Results: Response rate was 37 % for ophthalmologists and 34 % for <b>neurologists.</b> The most common causes of acquired nystagmus were estimated to be multiple sclerosis and stroke. 58 % of ophthalmologists and 94. 5 % of <b>neurologists</b> reported seeing patients with nystagmus. The most common used medical treatment was gabapentin and baclofen. Other drugs used were clonazepam, carbamazepine, benzhexol, ondansetrone, buspirone, memantine and botulinum toxin (n= 3). 11 ophthalmologists and 52 <b>neurologists</b> noted symptomatic improvement with medical treatment. 11 ophthalmologists and 44 <b>neurologists</b> noted improvement in visual acuity (VA). Occurrence of side effects noted with baclofen and gabapentin treatments were similar. Conclusion: A variety of drugs are used to treat acquired nystagmus in the UK. Baclofen and gabapentin are the drugs most commonly used and are reported to cause significant improvement in symptoms and VA. Better knowledge of the action of drugs in nystagmus is needed to establish guidelines and to give patients wider access to treatment...|$|R

This survey evaluated neurologists’ perception of treatment adherence among MS patients. Materials and methods: This questionnaire-based survey of Belgian <b>neurologists</b> treating MS patients was conducted between June and July 2014. Face-to-face {{interviews with the}} <b>neurologists</b> {{were based on a}} semistructured questionnaire containing questions regarding the perception of the treatment-adherence level. Results: A total of 41 <b>neurologists</b> participated in the survey. Of these, 88 % indicated frequent discussions about treatment adherence as beneficial for treatment efficacy. The mean time spent on the treatment-adherence discussion during the initial consultation was 11 minutes, with 24 % of doctors spending 5 minutes and 24 % of doctors spending 10 minutes discussing this issue. The majority of <b>neurologists</b> (56 %) perceived the adherence level in MS as good, and 12 % perceived it as excellent. The majority of <b>neurologists</b> (64 %) indicated intolerance as a main cause of poor adherence, and all <b>neurologists</b> reported insufficient efficacy as a consequence of nonadherence. The importance of adherence in the neurologists’ practice was evaluated on a scale of 1 – 10, with 1 = “not very important” and 10 = “very important”: 44 % of doctors indicated a score of 10, and the mean score was 9. 0. Conclusion: Belgian <b>neurologists</b> consider treatment adherence in MS as essential for the benefits of therapies.
