Acquisition periods included repeated PN conditions, choir room rehearsals and participant (N = 3) Leq and noise dosages procured during {{a day in the}} life of a music student. Among primary results: (a) All dosimeters exhibited very strong positive correlations for PN measurements across all instruments; (b) all dosimeters were within the recommended American National Standard Institute (ANSI) SI. 25 - 1991 standard of ± 2 dB (A) of a reference measurement; and (c) all dosimeters were within the recommended ANSI SI. 25 - 1991 standard of ± 2 dB (A) when compared with each other. Results were discussed in terms of using personal <b>noise</b> <b>dosimeters</b> within hearing conservation and research contexts and recommendations for future research. Personal <b>noise</b> <b>dosimeters</b> were studied within the contexts of PN environments and NEs (choral classroom and the day in the life of collegiate music students). This quantitative study was a non-experimental correlation design. Three brands of personal <b>noise</b> <b>dosimeters</b> (Cirrus doseBadge, Quest Edge Eg 5 and Etymotic ER 200 D) were tested in two environments, a PN setting and a natural setting. There were two conditions within each environment. In the PN environment condition one, each dosimeter was tested individually in comparison with two reference measuring devices (Ivie and Easera) while PN was generated by a Whites Instrument PN Tube. In condition two, the PN procedures were replicated for longer periods while all dosimeters measured the sound levels simultaneously. In the NE condition one, all dosimeters were placed side by side on a music stand and recorded sound levels of choir rehearsals over a 7 -h rehearsal period. In NE, condition two noise levels were measured during {{a day in the life}} of college music students. Three participants each wore two types of dosimeters for an 8 -h period during a normal school day. Descriptive statistical analyzes including means, standard deviation and Pearson product-moment correlation. The primary finding is that the dosimeters in this study recorded results within ± 2 dB of either a reference measurement or within dosimeters in all four conditions examined. All dosimeters studied measured steady noise source accurately and consistently, with strong positive correlations across all instruments. Measurements acquired during choral rehearsals indicated a maximum of 1. 5 dB difference across dosimeters. The Etymotic research personal <b>noise</b> <b>dosimeters</b> (ER 200 D) could provide individuals and schools of music with a relatively inexpensive tool to monitor sound doses.

The designed <b>noise</b> <b>dosimeter</b> enables assessing temporary threshold shift (TTS) in critical bands in real time. In this way it is possible monitoring the hearing threshold shift continuously for people who stay in the harmful noise conditions. Moreover, the psychoacoustical <b>noise</b> <b>dosimeter</b> (PND) provides the functionality which determines time causing an increase of the assumed hearing threshold shift along with time required for recov-ery of a hearing threshold toward its initial value. Noise exposure levels, its duration along with hearing examination have been rst measured in the acoustically controlled environ-ment. Pure-tone audiometry {{has been used for}} hearing examination. This has been conducted in constant time intervals, during noise exposure as well as during resting time (time required for hearing recovery). The examination aims at measuring hearing threshold at 4 kHz. The important part of this study is validation of the dosimeter performance in the real noise ex-posure situation. In this case the whole noise measurement scenario encompasses both noise exposure effects, and hearing examination before and after noise exposure.

40|$|An {{assessment}} of noise exposure and hearing thresholds among orchestral musicians {{was carried out}} at the Royal College of Music (RCM). Sound exposure data was taken over a one week period using personal <b>noise</b> <b>dosimeters</b> attached to ten RCM orchestra students during rehearsals and during a performance (Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2 and Sibelius’s Symphony No. 2). Noise levels (and compliance with the UK’s noise at work regulations) depended upon the type of instrument being played and where musicians were seated. For example, the average 8 -hour A-weighted dosage for the trumpet was LEP,d= 88. 4 dB(A), while it was only 77. 1 dB(A) for the double bass. This suggests that different hearing protection strategies may be appropriate for different musicians.

This field study concludes that there is no practical difference between the sound levels measured with sound level meters or noise dosimeters as long as the instruments meet type 2 tolerances as defined in the American National Standards Institute standard S 1. 4. Type 2 instruments are generally specified as having an accuracy of + 2 dBA. In addition, this study corroborates previously reported laboratory studies that were used to formulate Mine Safety and Health Administration policy for the location of the <b>noise</b> <b>dosimeter</b> microphone...|$|E
40|$|For musicians, {{the impact}} of noise {{exposure}} is not yet fully characterized. Some inconsistencies {{can be found in}} the methodology used to evaluate noise exposure. This study aims to analyze the noise exposure of musicians in a symphonic orchestra to understand their risk for hearing loss, applying the methodology proposed by ISO 9612 : 2009. Noise levels were monitored among musicians during the rehearsal of eight different repertoires. Test subjects were selected according to their instrument and position in the orchestra. Participants wore <b>noise</b> <b>dosimeters</b> throughout the rehearsals. A sound meter was used to analyze the exposure of the conductor. The results showed that musicians are exposed to high noise levels that can damage hearing. Brass, woodwind and percussion and timpani musicians were exposed to noise levels in excess of the upper exposure action level of 85 dB (A), while the other instrumental groups had a lower exposure action level of 80 dB (A). Percussion musicians were exposed to high peak noise levels of 135 dB (C). Sound levels varied by instrument, repertoire and position. Octave frequency analyses showed differences among musicians. This study suggests that musicians are at risk for hearing loss. There is a need for more effective guidelines applicable to all countries, which should define standardized procedures for determining musician noise exposure and should allow exposure level normalization to the year, including different repertoires...|$|R
40|$|Construction {{activities}} often generate noise complaints {{despite a}} short period of time framed over it takes place. One of the major contributions in noise is the construction equipments which tend to produce a high noise level. However, the noises from construction equipments do expose the workers who handle the task. Studies have shown most of the noise exposure do harm the safety and health of workers. This study focuses on (1) obtaining noise level among construction workers, (2) the compliance of permissible noise exposure level among workers; (3) assess the awareness and perceptions of noise exposure among workers and (4) explore the perceptions of noise impacts to safety and health workers. Occupational noise exposures for one hour among construction workers were assessed using <b>noise</b> <b>dosimeters</b> for on-site measurement and questionnaire surveys at the study construction site. The results for projection eight hours showed that almost all the activities exceeded the recommended noise level permitted by HSE whereas only one of the activities exceeded the FMR first schedule and OSHA permissible limit. For questionnaire surveys, the level awareness was encouraging yet a slight percentage revealed about the effects of noise in terms of age and work experience of respondents. Consequently, more approaches on the importance of noise exposure should be taken into consideration in order to improve awareness and mitigates the noise exposure...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the accuracy of}} smart devices (iPods) to measure intermittent noise and integrate a noise dose in the workplace. Materials and Methods: In experiment 1, four iPods were each paired with a Larson Davis Spark dosimeter and exposed to randomly fluctuating pink noise in a reverberant sound chamber. Descriptive statistics and the mean difference between the iPod and its paired dosimeter were calculated for the 1 -s data logged measurements. The calculated time weighted average (TWA) was also compared between the devices. In experiment 2, 15 maintenance workers and 14 office workers wore an iPod and dosimeter during their work-shift for a maximum of five workdays. A mixed effects linear regression model was used to control for repeated measures and to {{determine the}} effect of the device type on the projected 8 -h TWA. Results: In experiment 1, a total of 315, 306 1 -s data logged measurements were made. The interquartile range of the mean difference fell within[*]± 2. 0 A-weighted decibels (dBA), which is the standard used by the American National Standards Institute to classify a type 2 sound level meter. The mean difference of the calculated TWA was within[*]± 0. 5 dBA except for one outlier. In experiment 2, the results of the mixed effects model found that, on average, iPods measured an 8 -h TWA 1. 7 dBA higher than their paired dosimeters. Conclusion: This study shows that iPods have the ability to make reasonably accurate noise measurements in the workplace, but they are not as accurate as traditional <b>noise</b> <b>dosimeters...</b>|$|R
