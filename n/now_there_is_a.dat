It was clear that such important news would have a great effect in the camp; at the same time, the rejoicing it would bring would undoubtedly alert the Japanese. It was therefore decided to provide a hint to the other prisoners, rather than the full information. This was again delivered by a priest, this time by the padre officiating {{at one of the}} numerous funeral services.

[...] "It has to be defined as a positioning of players. Dimitri is very well aware that he has to dance a little dance with her." [...] Nixon made the relationship different from Erica's other ones. In previous romances, she acted as the aggressor. In this one, Nixon positioned Dimitri as the one who pursued Erica and made the first sexual overtures. She also used the Erica and Dimitri relationship as a way of developing a new, more sexual side of Dimitri. Nader said, [...] "There was a part of Dimitri that he never explored before because he married so young. A part of him shut down.

The workshop featured three US evangelical Christians: Scott Lively, an author who has written several books opposing homosexuality; Caleb Lee Brundidge, a self-professed former gay man who conducts sessions to heal homosexuality; and Don Schmierer, {{a board member of}} Exodus International, an organisation devoted to promoting [...] "freedom from homosexuality through the power of Jesus Christ". The theme of the conference, according to The New York Times, was the [...] "gay agenda": [...] "how to make gay people straight, how gay men often sodomized teenage boys and how 'the gay movement is an evil institution' whose goal is 'to defeat the marriage-based society {{and replace it with a}} culture of sexual promiscuity'". Kapya Kaoma, an Anglican priest from Zambia, was in attendance and reported on the conference. Lively asserted in his workshops that legalizing homosexuality would be akin to accepting child molestation and bestiality. He also claimed that gays threaten society by causing higher divorce rates, child abuse, and HIV transmission. He said that US homosexuals are out to recruit young people into homosexual lifestyles. According to Kaoma, one of the thousands of Ugandans in attendance announced during the conference, [...] " [...] feels it is necessary to draft a new law that deals comprehensively with the issue of homosexuality and ... takes into account the international gay agenda....

2500|$|The {{last major}} {{thing that would}} happen with the Soviet Science Academy would be a {{struggle}} to allow more Western ideas into the Physics Department. This obviously {{was in response to}} America having nuclear weapons and the Soviet Union realizing they needed to catch up with them. An article would be published by Vladimir Fock through the Soviet Science academy criticizing the theories of Einstein because he was a Western scientist. [...] However, this propagandist work was found to have shoddy science behind it and the entire department upon inspection was found to be less productive {{than the rest of the}} Science Academy. The more realistic scientific work written by Moisey Alexandrovich Markov which agreed with Western theories would receive more support. So in the beginning, with people like Aleksandrov in the philosophy department there was the idea that people should not bring up Western ideology even to criticize it and explain why Communism is better but <b>now</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> turnaround where because beating the West is what matters good science needs to take place even if it means talking about ideas that go against principles to do so. This is because the philosophy of the West had been more important to defeat than proper research methods until the concerns about nuclear war emerged. They would decide to fire more of the department and hire more competent people because of the increased importance of nuclear research. The need for physicists would protect Jewish people from the xenophobic wrath of Stalin and Beria but not everyone would be spared for these reasons. [...] Still many scientists would be protected by the institute because they were seen as important to the success of the country. The Soviet Science Academy would help to play their part in the goal of the Soviet Union to surpass the military might of the United States through the use of physics and chemistry research.|$|E
2500|$|Those {{who were}} {{converted}} by St. Thomas in the 1st century continued worshiping in synagogues. Then {{they moved to}} their homes and by the 2nd century, they began {{to build their own}} churches (called ‘’Palli’’) in various places. It is believed that there were such small gatherings at Maliankara, Piravom, Niranam (Nelcynda) and Nilakkal. St. Thomas Christians in Kerala, still construct their churches combining the design of Solomon's temple at Jerusalem, and Indian Vastu Shastra. So from outside it looks like a Hindu temple but inside it is like a Jewish temple. It is divided into Sanctuary (Madbaha) and Nave (Haickala). MarThoma Churches are built east west with the Sanctuary (Madbaha) to the east. [...] East is the place of the rising suns that is the symbol of the Risen Christ and His Second coming. East also symbolizes the Garden of Eden that was situated at the east. The Sanctuary is separated {{from the rest of the}} place by a veil with the sign of a cross. The worship of the Eastern churches symbolizes the heavenly worship. Madbaha symbolically represents Heaven and Haickala, the earth and veil the sky. The Madbaha is demarcated from the bema with an open arch and a veil. At the beginning of Holy Qurbana Service the veil is drawn from right side to left. Marthoma Syrians have abandoned the West syriac tradition of erecting more than one Altar and Madhbaha in Church and also forbade dedication of Altar/Thronos in name of a Saint or a Holy church father and conducting Holy Qurbana at Altar simultaneously or separate. The pulpit and lectern are also usually found at the extension of the bema. Bema is demarcated from the nave and transept(widely uses a vestibule space before the nave) with altar rails. The Choir is seated at one end of the transepts in the same level of the nave. <b>Now</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> tendency to follow western architectural designs and introducing ciboriums, semi-domes...etc.|$|E

2500|$|The stadium {{has also}} been criticized for its lack of fan noise. During a Sunday Night Baseball {{telecast}} in 2012, commentator and former Red Sox manager Terry Francona spoke about the different atmospheres in {{the old and new}} stadiums saying that [...] "As a visiting team, especially for the Red Sox, by the time the (national) anthem was over, you couldn't wait {{to get back in the}} dugout. <b>Now</b> (<b>there</b> <b>is)</b> <b>a</b> little different (kind) of fan sitting around down there by the dugout." [...] Games at the new stadium do not feature the same deafening crowd moments and often sound eerily silent. The lack of fan noise was noticeable in the 2012 playoffs as well, with thousands of unsold seats for Game 5 of the ALDS and Games 1 and 2 of the ALCS. [...] "This is a very easy place to play now", said Quintin Berry of the Detroit Tigers, the Yankees' ALCS opponents. [...] "Coming from Oakland, the fans there were so rowdy. It was easier to come here." [...] In his autobiography [...] "The Closer", the Yankees' longtime relief pitcher Mariano Rivera wrote these comments about the new stadium's atmosphere: [...] "It doesn’t hold noise, or home-team fervor, anywhere near the way the old place did. The old Stadium was our 10th man—a loud and frenzied cauldron of pinstriped passion, with a lot of lifers in the stands. Maybe I’m wrong, but it's hard to see that the new place can ever quite duplicate that. Derek Jeter echoed this sentiment in a September 2014 article in New York magazine, Jeter said he missed the original Yankee Stadium: [...] "It was a different feel. The new stadium, it's second to none—all the amenities. For the players, it really doesn’t get any better. The old stadium, if you were at the stadium, in the stands, the only place you could see the game was in your seat. Now there's so many suites and places people can go. So a lot of times it looks like it's empty, but it's really not. The old stadium, it was more intimidating. The fans were right on top of you." ...|$|E
