25|$|During the 2009 {{legislative}} elections campaign, {{it appeared}} that the <b>New</b> <b>Komeito</b> Party, the Japanese Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party were clearly in favor of extending local voting rights to foreign residents, while the Liberal Democratic Party was totally opposed to it and the Democratic Party of Japan was divided on this matter, but rather in favor of the extension of voting rights, so gaining the support of the Korean Residents Union in Japan (Mindan) for many of its candidates.

2500|$|In 1961 Soka Gakkai {{formed the}} [...] "Komei Political League". [...] Seven of its {{candidates}} were {{elected to the}} House of Councillors. [...] In 1964 the Komeito (Clean Government Party) was formed by Ikeda. Over {{the course of several}} elections it became the third largest political party, typically amassing 10–15% of the popular vote. The <b>New</b> <b>Komeito</b> Party was founded in 1998 and has been allied with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) since 1999. Religious scholar and political analyst Masaru Sato explains that there is nothing surprising about Komeito becoming a member of a ruling coalition as the Soka Gakkai has become a world religion (as SGI) and history shows a link between ruling coalitions and world religions. He explains that in postwar Japan there were two major parties, the Liberal Democratic Party representing financial interests and large corporations and the Japan Socialist Party largely advocating the interests of labor unions. There was no single party that represented people who belonged to neither such as shop owners, housewives, etc. Until the appearance of the Komeito Party, such people were left on the sidelines. [...] In 2014 the <b>New</b> <b>Komeito</b> was renamed Komeito again. Komeito generally supports the policy agenda of the LDP, including the reinterpretation of the pacifist Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan, proposed in 2014 by LDP Prime Minister Shinzō Abe to allow [...] "collective defense" [...] and to fight in foreign conflicts.|$|E

He agreed not to introduce a no-confidence motion or a censure motion against Noda, in return for Noda's promise to hold elections [...] "soon." [...] On 28 August 2012, soon after the consumption tax bills were passed through the diet a censure motion was passed by the LDP and the <b>New</b> <b>Komeito</b> Party against Prime Minister Noda. The opposition parties were to boycott debate in the chamber, meaning that any new bills passed in the DPJ-controlled House of Representatives cannot be enacted.|$|E
