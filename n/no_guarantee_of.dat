5|$|On November 29, 1820, the Assembly {{chartered}} the Bank of the Commonwealth, {{another source}} from which debtors could obtain money. Creditors {{did not want}} to accept payment from either the Bank of Kentucky or the Bank of the Commonwealth; the notes of the former were depreciated {{due to a lack of}} capital and the latter had no capital and <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> state credit. In December 1820, the Assembly modified the replevin law to state that creditors who would accept payment in notes from the Bank of the Commonwealth but not the Bank of Kentucky would be forced to wait three months to collect on a debt. The wait was one year if the creditor accepted only notes from the Bank of Kentucky, and it remained two years for creditors who would not accept notes from either.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} marriage, Woodruff decided {{to travel to}} England {{in order to take}} {{the second half of the}} FRCS Exam. Woodruff took his new wife over with <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> employment, and {{declined}} a two-year travelling fellowship to Oxford University offered by the Australian Red Cross because it required him to return home and work. Before departing, he applied for a position as a Tutor of Surgery at the University of Sheffield, and learned en route that they had accepted his application. He took the FRCS exam in 1947 and passed—a result that, in Woodruff's view, was certainly not hindered by the fact that one of his examiners, Colonel Julian Taylor, had been with him at Changi.|$|E

50|$|DDP was the lowest-level data-link-independent {{transport}} protocol. It {{provided a}} datagram service with <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> delivery. All application-level protocols, including the infrastructure protocols NBP, RTMP and ZIP, were built {{on top of}} DDP. AppleTalk's DDP corresponds closely to the Network layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) communication model.|$|R
50|$|There are, <b>of</b> course, <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> {{success for}} an {{individual}} to become a celebrity.

As an example, after an {{accounting}} scandal and a Chapter 11 bankruptcy at the giant telecommunications company Worldcom, in 2004 its bondholders ended up being paid 35.7 cents on the dollar. In a bankruptcy involving reorganization or recapitalization, as opposed to liquidation, bondholders may end up having {{the value of their}} bonds reduced, often through an exchange for a smaller number of newly issued bonds.|$|E
25|$|The {{organizers}} of World Series Hockey decided {{to postpone the}} event by two months due to uncertainty over the participation of Indian players ahead of the Olympic qualifiers. Confirming this in a release on 12 December, Nimbus Sport said the franchisee-based tournament would now be held between 29 February and 2 April. However, Hockey India officials were quick to clarify that there was <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> the national squad members being available on those dates if they correspond with their preparatory camps.|$|E
25|$|The scheme {{designed}} by Saunders and Barratt contained full designs, site surveys and runoff estimates, despite <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> approval or financial incentive. The plan included reticulation for both Perth and Fremantle. In July and August 1887, a Legislative Council Select Committee appointed {{to examine the}} proposal passed the issue back to local government. Fremantle refused {{to participate in the}} water supply scheme, so following the departure from the Civil Engineering partnership of Barratt, Saunders removed Fremantle from the plan.|$|E
50|$|Service {{providers}} face obstacles selling {{services that}} goods-sellers rarely face.

25|$|Colorado got {{its second}} win of the season. Iowa State's head coach Dan McCarney {{announced}} {{the week before}} the game he was resigning his position. Crosby went 4–5 in field goals and 3–3 in PATs. This was the last home game of the season and the last home game for Colorado's seniors. Jackson had a career performance day throwing for 200yards, including 2 TDs and running for another 69yard TD. However, Hawkins stated that Jackson has <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> being the starting QB next season.|$|E
25|$|Contraception is not {{a common}} form of control, but is {{preferred}} by some wildlife managers. It also is expensive to operate - an estimated $6 million annually to drop bait laced with birth-control chemicals. Testing of other potential contraceptives would take about five to eight years and $10 million, with <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> FDA approval. Also, an intensive environmental assessment {{would have to be}} completed to determine whether any nontarget organisms were affected by the contraceptive chemicals. Neither of these control methods is likely {{to be used in the}} near future.|$|E
25|$|In July 2008, Hilary Benn, {{the then}} Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, refused to {{authorise}} a badger cull {{because of the}} practicalities and cost of a cull and the scale and length of time required to implement it, with <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> success {{and the potential for}} making the disease worse. Benn went on to highlight other measures that would be taken, including allocating £20m to the development of an effective injectable TB vaccine for both cattle and badgers, and an oral badger vaccine.|$|E
50|$|The ABR service {{category}} {{is similar to}} nrt-VBR, because it also is used for connections that transport variable bit rate traffic {{for which there is}} no reliance on time synchronisation between the traffic source and destination, and for which <b>no</b> required <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> bandwidth or latency exist. ABR provides a best-effort transport service, in which flow-control mechanisms are used to adjust the amount of bandwidth available to the traffic originator. The ABR service {{category is}} designed primarily for any type of traffic that is not time sensitive and expects <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> service. ABR service generally is considered preferable for TCP/IP traffic, as well as other LAN-based protocols, that can modify its transmission behaviour in response to the ABR’s rate-control mechanics.|$|R

25|$|In 2005 Transport for London (TfL) {{tentatively}} {{committed to}} providing up to £18m {{of the estimated}} cost of £65m, predicting that the link would be operational by 2010. Difficulties arose in securing the remaining funding from the Department for Transport (DfT) and a revised project submission, under new guidelines, was prepared, {{with a view to}} obtaining Programme Entry status. A business case was submitted to the DfT in February 2008, with revised costs of £95m. The proposal was rejected in March on the basis that <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> financial backing had been received from TfL.|$|E
25|$|Sequence number: (16 bits) The {{sequence}} number is incremented by {{one for each}} RTP data packet sent and {{is to be used}} by the receiver to detect packet loss and to restore packet sequence. The RTP does not specify any action on packet loss; it is left to the application to take appropriate action. For example, video applications may play the last known frame in place of the missing frame. According to , the initial value of the {{sequence number}} should be random to make known-plaintext attacks on encryption more difficult. RTP provides <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> delivery, but the presence of sequence numbers makes it possible to detect missing packets.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Northern Irish and Scottish notes, the UK {{does not}} require the Isle of Man {{government}} to back the Manx currency with Bank of England notes or securities. There is no restriction under UK law on the amount of notes and coins they may issue. The currency is not underwritten by the UK government, and there is <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> payment beyond that given by the Manx authorities. However, the requirement in the island's Currency Act 1992 for the Isle of Man Treasury to exchange Manx Pound banknotes on demand for Bank of England notes in practice restricts the issue of unbacked currency, and the aggregate total of notes issued must be pre-approved by Tynwald.|$|E

This architecture considers how the components of an application can be integrated so that the privacy and security of user data are guaranteed. The sensitive part of the processing is therefore isolated and the architecture considers different strategies for aggregating sensitive data in environments where there are <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> full confidentiality.|$|R

30|$|Artificial neural {{networks}} (ANNs) {{have been widely}} used as a useful tool for nonlinear soft sensing models. However, they give <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> high convergence speed or of avoiding local minima, while there are no general methods to choose the number of hidden units in the networks. Moreover, they need a large number of controlling parameters, have difficulty in obtaining stable solutions with the danger of overfitting, and thus lack generalization capability (Liu et al. 2010).|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the ideals}} of {{democracy}} are far from realised on the mainland. For example, former Chinese premier Wen Jiabao once {{said in a speech}} that without real democracy, there is <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> economic and political rights; but he led a 2011 crackdown against the peaceful Chinese jasmine protests. Liu Xiaobo, a pro-democracy activist who received the global 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, died in prison. Others, such as Qin Yongmin (秦永敏) of the Democracy Party of China, who was only released from prison after twelve years, do not praise the Xinhai Revolution. Qin Yongmin said the revolution only replaced one dictator with another, that Mao Zedong was not an emperor, but he is worse than the emperor.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, Sultan Muhammad Jiwa {{died and}} was succeeded by Sultan Abdullah Mahrum Shah. The new Sultan offered Light (who {{later became a}} British representative) the island of Penang in return for {{military}} assistance for Kedah. Light informed the East India Company of the Sultan's offer. The Company, however, ordered Light to take over Penang and gave him <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> the military aid that the Sultan had asked for earlier. Light later took over Penang and assured the Sultan of military assistance, despite the Company's position. Soon the Company made up its mind and told Light {{that they would not}} give any military aid to Kedah. In June 1788, Light informed the Sultan of the Company's decision. Feeling cheated, the Sultan ordered Light to leave Penang, but Light refused.|$|E
25|$|In 1831 Hayter {{returned}} to England. His grandiose plan {{to paint the}} first sitting {{after the passage of}} the Reform Bill resulted in his painting 'Moving the Address to the Crown on the Opening of the First Reformed Parliament in the Old House of Commons, 5 February 1833' (1833–43; London, N.P.G.), for which he executed nearly 400 portrait studies in oil. Hayter was an ardent supporter of the reform movement and this painting was not commissioned but to all intents and purposes a labour of love. It occupied him for ten years with <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> financial reward. This {{is one of the last}} images executed of the interior of the old House of Commons before its destruction in the fire of 1834. The painting was finally purchased by the government for the nation in 1854, 20 years after it was started.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{challenges}} a view {{of concrete}} materials as abstracts used within a rigid instructional sequence that particular children are perceived to require or not, {{as the case may}} be. Focussing on mathematics teaching, it contends that it is more useful to consider the function of these materials as tools, artefacts used flexibly and selectively by pupils to make sense of mathematics, rather than as crutches, devices which may support procedural competency in mathematics but with <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> understanding...|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} {{supposed}} that an electronic library {{is synonymous with}} a database: a closed world with strict access to only the materials inside the database. The World-Wide Web, by contrast, is an open environment with many participating sites but no enforced control and therefore <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> data permanence or consistency. In this paper we compare {{the advantages of the}} open- and closed-world views in terms of two systems which embody them, and describe an Electronic Libraries project which is taking advantage of the open perspective...|$|R
