Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.|$|E

Igor Nesterov, head of seismology of USSR, said the Leninakan seismic station was destroyed so there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> whether it received reports of an earthquake coming its way, although Nesterovs' colleagues later said the station was not able to receive reports {{because of the lack of}} instruments it carried.|$|E

5|$|Little of {{this was}} true, {{but at the time}} the British had <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> this. The files of the Admiralstab in Berlin show that he was {{approached}} by N, rather than volunteering for intelligence service, entered their employment as early as May 1914 (rather than in August as he claimed), received regular pay rather than being unpaid, and intended to return to Berlin on completing his mission. It is unknown whether he really had any intention of going to the US, and there is no indication from the Admiralstab files that he had been asked to keep his controller's name a secret. After hearing Lody's evidence the court martial was adjourned until the following Monday.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as the}} two armies {{were drawn}} up, a clamour arose from the German ranks, loudly {{demanding}} that Chnodomar and his entourage of chiefs should dismount and lead {{the main body of}} German foot warriors from the front. Chnodomar and the chiefs immediately complied. In so doing, Chnodomar forfeited any strategic control of the battle, as, trapped in the centre of the action, he would have <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> what was happening in other sectors. Julian, on the other hand, maintained a detached position throughout (with his escort) and so was able to respond to events all over the field, such as the initial rout of his cavalry.

The greatly expanded public voice wielded by Jews in western European countries following recent moves towards freedom of the press, coupled with Jewish political emancipation in the Kingdom of Sardinia, Britain, France and the United States, caused Mortara's removal to gain press attention far beyond anything previously given to such incidents. The papal government was initially disposed to simply ignore Momolo's appeals, but reconsidered after newspapers began reporting on the case; the pontifical state's many detractors seized on the episode {{as an example of}} papal tyranny.|$|E

Although Middlesbrough West had been Liberal since 1918 and the predecessor seat of Middlesbrough had been Liberal since 1886 (with the exception of the 1900 general election), no recent contest had been three-cornered and Trevelyan Thompson had made the seat so much his own that he had not even been opposed in 1924.

5|$|By 11:04, Lindmayr's Dorniers {{had reached}} Calais. Wing Commander Lord Willoughby de Broke, Park’s senior fighter controller, watched with the Prime Minister and Park as the Germans moved closer. De Broke {{had a problem}} of his own. He had <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> which plots {{represented}} bombers and fighters. Bombers had to be intercepted, fighters could be ignored. The trick was {{to strike a balance}} and time the interception as well as possible. On one hand he must scramble early and allow enough time to get into a favourable attack position; {{but on the other hand}} he had to avoid scrambling them too early lest the fighters run short of fuel before they met the enemy. Park joined de Broke. After a brief discussion he decided to commit several squadrons from RAF Biggin Hill. Park realised the raid could be a trap. Though the target seemed to be London, the aircraft, comprising 120–150 in number, may be an advanced guard of Bf 109s sent to clear the skies or disrupt fighter defences. Still, he gambled and sent nine squadrons into action at 11:15.|$|E
5|$|Over Romney Marsh Nos. 41, 92 and 222 Squadrons engaged JG 26, {{losing one}} of their number to the Bf 109s. The second wave of RAF fighters arrived on the scene, {{comprising}} 607 and 213 Squadrons with 23 Hurricanes. They initiated a head-on attack against the Do 17s of KG 3. A Hurricane and a Dornier collided, both going down. The Bf 109s {{did their best to}} break up attacks and the bombers held a tight formation, putting up withering cross-fire. The Bf 109s were not permitted to leave the bombers and chase enemy fighters. Time and again, they were forced to break off and return to the bomber stream, allowing the RAF fighters to return and repeat the process. Soon after, No. 605 and No. 501 Squadron arrived with 14 Hurricanes. One fighter was hit by return fire, but the pilot aimed his aircraft at a Dornier and bailed out. The fighter collided and destroyed the bomber. The German bomber crews had <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> that the crashes were not premeditated. It seemed as if the British were desperate. Nevertheless, they thought the 'tactic' was devastatingly effective. Chastened by losses, the Dorniers closed ranks to snuff out the gaps and continued to their target.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a formal {{analysis}} of whether generalized phrase structure grammar's (GPSG) weak context-free generative power will {{allow it to}} achieve three of its central goals: (1) to characterize all and only the natural language grammars, (2) to algorithmically determine membership and generative power consequences of GPSG's and (3) to embody the universalism of natural language entirely in the formal system.
