5|$|The {{entirety}} of modern-day NY164 was originally designated as NY312 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>When</b> the NY312 designation was shifted south {{to its current}} location {{in the town of}} Southeast , its former routing in Patterson became part of an extended NY216, which connected with its current routing by way of modern NY311, NY292 and NY55. NY216 was truncated to its current length on January1, 1970. The portion of its former alignment between NY311 and NY22 was then redesignated as NY164.|$|E

The senior Brady had emigrated from Ireland to the United States while the War of 1812 was ongoing, and started a boys school in <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>When</b> James was seven, he {{attended}} his father's school. In 1831 James's father had left teaching to become a lawyer, and he helped his father in his practice and in trials. In his father's office, James studied legal material tirelessly, and soon operated most of the firm's managerial affairs.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, the New York State Legislature created Route46, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} Coopers Plains in Steuben County to Trumansburg in Tompkins County via Watkins Glen. East of Watkins Glen, Route46 proceeded generally northeastward through Burdett, Reynoldsville and Mecklenburg {{on its way}} to Trumansburg. On March1, 1921, the Route46 designation was reassigned to another highway in Allegany and Steuben counties as part of a partial renumbering of the legislative route system. The section of pre-1921 Route46 between Mecklenburg and Perry City went unnumbered until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>when</b> it became part of NY79.|$|E
5|$|In Tompkins County, {{the road}} was reconstructed {{as part of a}} project {{contracted}} out on August24, 1916. Work on the highway was completed in the early-to-mid-1920s, and the improved road was added to the state highway system as SH1433. The Groton–Cortland state highway did not have a posted route number until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>when</b> hundreds of state-maintained highways were assigned a designation for the first time. SH446, SH996, and SH1433 were collectively designated as NY222, which continued east into downtown Cortland by way of locally maintained streets. The alignment of NY222 has not been changed since that time.|$|E
5|$|Jesse is Jewish and {{was brought}} up in a secular Jewish family that {{originated}} in Poland and Ukraine. He attended the East Brunswick Public Schools at Frost School, Hammarskjold Middle School, Churchill Junior High School, and spent his sophomore year at East Brunswick High School.

5|$|NY3 {{remained}} {{on what is}} now NY31 between Middleport and Medina until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>when</b> it was realigned between the two villages to use what is now NY31E. U.S. Route104 was assigned to all of Ridge Road , replacing then-NY31 west of Rochester. As a result, NY31 was shifted southward onto most of NY3 from Niagara Falls to Rochester, including between Middleport and Medina. NY31 was realigned on January1, 1949, to follow its current alignment between the two villages. The former routing of NY31 was redesignated as NY31E, a northerly alternate route of NY31.|$|E

5|$|The north–south highway {{connecting}} Crompond Road to {{the hamlet}} of Shrub Oak {{was acquired by}} the state of New York in the mid-1920s. It did not have a posted route number until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>when</b> it became part of NY132, a new route extending from US6 in Shrub Oak to NY22 near the hamlet of Katonah. The highway went southeast from Shrub Oak to Yorktown Heights on Crompond Street and Crompond Road, from where it traveled generally eastward to Katonah on Hallocks Mill, Saw Mill River, Amawalk, and Woods Bridge roads. In Katonah, NY132 used Woods Bridge Road, Bedford Road, and Jay Street to connect to NY22.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the route date back to 1914 when its routing was {{included}} {{as part of a}} spur route of Route30, a cross-state, unsigned legislative route. The spur route was eliminated in 1921, and the road went unnumbered until 1930 renumbering of state highways in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>when</b> it became part of NY3. Most of NY3 west of Rochester was replaced by NY31 in the mid-1930s, and NY31 was realigned onto its present, more southerly alignment between Middleport and Medina in 1949. Its former canalside alignment became NY31E at this time. Most of NY31E is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT); however, two sections in Niagara County and Medina are locally maintained.|$|E
5|$|Though he professed {{membership}} in the Democratic Party, Brady was notably disengaged from politics. In 1843 he was made the interim district attorney for New York County. Two years later, Brady was appointed the city's corporation counsel, a position in which he served two terms, each term lasting for a year. In 1850 Brady ran for, but was not elected to, the position of Attorney General of New York. Brady was on John C. Breckinridge and Joseph Lane's 1860 Democratic ticket for Governor of <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>When</b> the American Civil War began, Brady switched sides and became an ardent supporter of Abraham Lincoln and his Republican Party. He deeply disdained Southern politics and policy.|$|E

5|$|After James was deposed by William III and Mary II in the Glorious Revolution in late 1688, Massachusetts rose up in {{rebellion}} against Andros, arresting {{him and other}} dominion leaders in Boston. The revolt rapidly spread through the dominion, and the New England colonies quickly restored their pre-dominion governments. When news of the Boston revolt reached New York a week later, Nicholson took no steps to announce news of it, or of the revolution in England, for fear of raising prospects of rebellion in <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>When</b> word of the Boston revolt reached Long Island, politicians and militia leaders became more assertive, and by mid-May dominion officials had been ousted {{from a number of}} communities. At the same time, Nicholson learned that France had declared war on England, bringing the threat of French and Indian attacks on New York's northern frontier. In an attempt to mollify panicked citizenry over rumored Indian raids, Nicholson invited the militia to join the army garrison at Fort James.|$|E
5|$|After the convention, Willkie {{returned}} to <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>When</b> {{he went to}} the movies, he received a standing ovation, as he did when he went to see the play Life With Father. He resigned from C on July 8, 1940, confident that even if he lost his presidential bid, he would not lack for work. He had Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman John Hamilton dismissed on the advice of some of his advisors, who felt Hamilton was too conservative and isolationist, though the former chairman was given the post of executive director with partial responsibility for the Willkie campaign. Congressman Martin became RNC chair. At a time when little campaigning was done until after Labor Day, Willkie left on a five-week working vacation to The Broadmoor, a resort in Colorado Springs, but found neither peace nor privacy.|$|E
5|$|Arthur {{was born}} in Fairfield, Vermont, grew up in upstate New York, and practiced law in New York City. He served as {{quartermaster}} general in the New York Militia during the American Civil War. Following the war, he devoted more time to Republican politics and quickly rose in the political machine run by New York Senator Roscoe Conkling. Appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant to the lucrative and politically powerful post of Collector of the Port of New York in 1871, Arthur was an important supporter of Conkling and the Stalwart faction of the Republican Party. In 1878, the new president, Rutherford B. Hayes, fired Arthur {{as part of a}} plan to reform the federal patronage system in <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>When</b> Garfield won the Republican nomination for president in 1880, Arthur, an eastern Stalwart, was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket.|$|E
