40|$|Background information: The {{recommendation}} for optimal breastfeeding duration in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is based firstly on the Quran {{and then the}} World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendation. The rate of initiation of breastfeeding in Saudi Arabia is over 90 %, with the early introduction of infant formula. Objective: To investigate breastfeeding practices at birth and one month postpartum and its association with the BFHI status of the hospital where delivery occurred, and with women’s intentions, self-efficacy, knowledge and attitudes, previous experience, support, and discouragement for breastfeeding. Study design: Longitudinal study with data collection at baseline and follow-up at one month postpartum. Method: Women were recruited from two private hospitals in Jeddah, one of these hospitals has baby friendly hospital policies (BFHI). A semi-quantitative questionnaire was used for collecting data by face-to-face interviews with women in the hospital after giving birth and by a phone interview at one month postpartum. SPSS was used for statistical analysis. Results: One hundred and two women completed the baseline survey, and 77 women completed the study at one month (36 from the BFHI and 41 from the non-BFHI). At baseline, 77 % women at the BFHI hospital had introduced breast milk as first <b>nutritive</b> <b>substance,</b> while only 7 % {{of women in the}} non-BFHI hospital did. However, at one month postpartum, mixed-feeding was the most common feeding method (58 %), and {{there was no difference in}} feeding method between women in both hospitals. All Egyptian women in the sample (n= 10) were fully breastfeeding at one month, and Saudi women were more likely to use mixed-feeding. Breastfeeding attitudes, self-efficacy, and previous experience were related to breastfeeding practice at one month. Considering all variables, logistic regression found that breastfeeding self-efficacy was the only variable associated with breastfeeding practice at one month, and women with a higher score were more likely to be exclusively, fully, or predominantly breastfeeding at one month (p= 0. 001). Conclusion: The BFHI was found to be effective in making breast milk the first <b>nutritive</b> <b>substance</b> infants received, and in encouraging early breastfeeding initiation. Breastfeeding self-efficacy was the strongest predictor of breastfeeding intention and practice at one month...|$|E

She was initially non-selective, but later began more exclusively consuming mud obtained from a wall in the back yard of her house on regular basis. She suffered from a eating disorder known as pica. The DSM-IV defines pica as a form of feeding and eating disorder of infancy or early childhood,characterized by “the persistent eating of non <b>nutritive</b> <b>substance</b> for a period of at least one month: inappropriate to the developmental level, not part of a culturally sanctioned practice and sufficiently severe enough to warrant independent attention. ” Currently there is no clearly established etiology for pica.

40|$|The {{investigations}} of Warburg in 1921 {{on the action}} of narcotics on cell respiration led to the formulation of his general theory of narcosis, according to which the action of a narcotic is attributed to its specific ability to occupy the vital surfaces of the cell structures, thereby displacing the adsorbed nutritive substances and important oxidative enzymes (1). The occasional observations of some investigators, describing a stimulating action of narcotics on the metabolic functions of the cell, seem hardly compatible with Warburg's theory; for, "adsorption displacement, " as Warburg calls the phenomenon, might bring about a depression, but not a stimulation of cellular metabolism. In his experiments on the respiration of the isolated spinal cord of the frog {{under the influence of}} ethyl alcohol, Winterstein (2) describes a series of cases in which low concentrations of this narcotic produced acceleration, higher concentrations, on the other hand, produced metabolic depression. Similar results were obtained by Garrey (3) in his experiments on the stimulating effect of ethyl alcohol on the CO~ production of the heart ganglia of Limulus polyphemus. Warburg, who made similar investigations on liver cells, avian erythrocytes, and the central nervous system, could find no such acceleration. Narcotic concentrations lower than those which caused metabolic depression were without effect. In explanation of this discrepancy between his results and those of other investigators, Warburg suggested (9) that metabolic acceleration would result upon administering a narcotic to starving ceils. The narcotic would then play the r 61 e of a <b>nutritive</b> <b>substance</b> and as such might be replaced by glucose or peptone with the same stimulating effect.

40|$|The {{life and}} work of the Alsatian hermeticist and Egyptosophist, René-Adolphe Schwaller de Lubicz (1887 - 1961) attests to the {{continued}} presence of a distinctly nondual current of alchemical precept and practice in which material transmutation and spiritual transmutation are not separate nor merely coincidental endeavours but two indispensably linked {{sides of the same}} coin. The link, for Schwaller, was perceived as a juncture of meta-physical and proto-physical forces, a process conceived in terms of an alchemical “salt” (a neutralisation reaction between an “acid” and a “base”). This thesis demonstrates that Lubiczian alchemy, by centring on the esoteric formation of all “bodies”, to include the hidden “nucleus” of continuity between metallurgical, biological and spiritual corporeality, speaks directly to the perception of alchemy as a nondual, operative-spiritual process. Before examining Schwaller’s work proper, part one of this thesis deals with methodological and historiographical considerations at some length. I begin by detailing the “hermetic problem of salt” through cultural-historical, mythographical, chemical and alchemical lenses in order to introduce the phenomenon of salt as an “abstract concretion” resulting from polarised opposites (acid and base, fire and water, sun and sea, sulphur and mercury, etc.) The juncture of opposing principles perceived in the “hermetic problem” of salt anticipates the methodological discussion, which examines the dichotomy between history and phenomenology, along with the materialist and metaphysical sympathies of these methodologies. Form mirroring content, the method employed in this thesis seeks to establish a “neutralisation reaction” between such extremes, encompassing both empirical-historical and eidetic-phenomenological approaches. The guiding model for this synthesis is the Heraclitean palintonos harmoniē (counter-stretched harmony), in which inherently opposed tensions are viewed as integral rather than antithetical to the deeper vitality of the whole. Following from this, the broader argument of this thesis is based upon the perception that the modern academic caricature of alchemy as either operative (reducible to chemical explanations) or spiritual (reducible to psychological explanations) is in many respects a false dichotomy. In support of a more integrative premise, detailed examples are adduced from both eastern and western branches of alchemy (i) to argue for the revision of rigidly dualistic biases within the historiography of alchemy and (ii) to lend support to the adoption of a more nuanced critical apparatus that is able {{to come to terms with}} nondualistic currents within the plurality of alchemies. Upon these premises, the {{life and work}} of Schwaller de Lubicz is turned to as a modern exemplar of this nondual current in alchemy. Part two of this thesis focuses on Schwaller de Lubicz’s life and work, his colour theory, and his alchemy. Through a detailed bio-bibliographical survey, the keys to Schwaller’s intellectual development are presented and situated within their relevant contexts. I examine his artistic, Theosophical, socio-political, initiatic, alchemical and Egyptological milieus. As a student of Matisse, Schwaller had a life-long interest in colour and light. For this reason, the colour phenomenon is presented as a guiding thread for the dynamics of Lubiczian alchemy in general and the “manipulation of salt” in particular. The colour theory is examined with reference to Newton’s Opticks, Goethe’s Farbenlehre and ultimately to the operative work on stained glass that Schwaller undertook with Jean-Julien Champagne (alias Fulcanelli). The work on colour, metals and stained glass is for Schwaller a propadeutic for understanding the process by which spirit (light, colour) transforms the bodies in which it is incarnated (matter, substance). Ultimately, the “hermetic problem of salt” is seen to centre directly upon the mineral register of an entity’s consciousness (palingenetic memory); because this imperishable register of consciousness is also the determiner of an entity’s form, salt is consequently regarded as the mechanism of evolution, resurrection and palingenesis. The deeper dynamics of Lubiczian alchemy thus concerns the role of this “fixed nucleus” in the formation of bodies, from mineral to human. In particular, I examine the principles of Schwaller’s metallurgical alchemy in order to understand how the “spirit of metals” acts as a fiery metallic seed (sulphur) that “coagulates” a <b>nutritive</b> <b>substance</b> (mercury) into a bodily form (salt). This understanding is applied to the stained-glass work. I then look at his meta-biological alchemy, in which it is not the genetic seed but the palingenetic mineral salt that forms the determining principle in the biological entity’s evolution. In essence, Schwaller’s “hermetic problem of salt” is understood as the fulcrum not only of individual immortality, but also of the qualitative mutations (leaps) between kingdoms and species. More specifically, the kingdoms of nature are seen to emerge alchemically through ‘qualitative exaltations’ induced by the divine seed-ferment (sulphur) upon the primordial materia (mercury) giving rise to a neutral centre of gravity: the saline magnetic nucleus or ‘styptic coagulating force’, the spiritual locus of physical form. In the final analysis, Schwaller’s alchemy is quintessentially nondual in the sense that it encompasses both operative and spiritual processes. These are not separate but deeply interrelated realities. Through the idea of salt, Schwaller offers a holarchical explanation for the continuities between mineralogical, biological and spiritual bodies, and thus a theory for the material mechanism by which consciousness transforms phenomenal form. To approach this kind of alchemy as exclusively chemical or psychological is thus completely inadequate and reinforces the necessity for a nondual critical apparatus...|$|E

Offering healthy eating to children, the suitable preservation and distribution of foodstuff, and the control of the different sites of the maintenance and allotment of the <b>nutritive</b> <b>substances</b> at the schools are considered to be of foremost importance. So the present study is intended to specify the extent of the control and supervision of the allotment and distribution of the foodstuff to the students and the amount of the nutritional and hygienic knowledge of the parents and educators at the primary schools in 2007. Material and Methods: This descriptive cross sectional study conducted on 5695 male and female students studying at 39 primary schools of Khorramabad (district one). In order to scrutinize the status of the supervision of supply and distribution of the <b>nutritive</b> <b>substances</b> to the students and the measurement of the amount of the nutritional and hygienic knowledge of the parents and educators, a census was carried out. It suffices to say that the parents’ samples were selected apropos the arrangement of the classificatory sampling,cluster sampling, the two-stage sampling, and finally systematic sampling. The data gathering tool was a two self-made questionnaire completed by the interviewees themselves. Subsequently, the data were described with respect to the frequency distribution tables, the x 2 independence tests and SPSS,V. 15 saftware. Results: It was considered that 29. 7 % of the primary schools possessed buffets. Besides, 40. 5 % of them had hygiene educators. The amount of the attentiveness of the parents and educators to the control and supervision of the <b>nutritive</b> <b>substances</b> at the buffets was 61. 5 %, which is considered as a relatively good estimate. In this way, it is posited that, there exists a significant relationship between the existences of buffets at the primary schools and the scope of the acquaintance of the parents and educators with the control and supervision of the supply and distribution of foodstuff. (P= 0 / 025) Nevertheless, the extent of the hygiene experts’ supervision on the supply of <b>nutritive</b> <b>substances</b> at the buffets was 14. 5 %, which is conceived to be rather poor. Conclusion: This study showed that, having a suitable place to present and distribute foodstuff in schools is necessary.

The bark of younger stems of rowan and beech (C 1 category) contained more <b>nutritive</b> <b>substances</b> (fat, crude protein) and the low content of fibre. The highest nutritional quality of the younger (C 1) stems of rowan resulted in higher impact (27 %). But the older rowan stems were of lower attractivity (10 %) than the older beech (37 %). Differences between the broadleaved tree bark and spruce bark were significant as to crude protein and the fibre content. Chemical analysis clearly explained selectivity between broad-leaved and coniferous trees...|$|R
40|$|Freshly {{collected}} {{samples of}} luminous mycelium of a terrestrial fungus from Panama were investigated for their bioluminescence characteristics. Taxonomic identification of fungal species {{could not be}} determined {{because of the lack}} of fruiting bodies. Fluorescence excited by 380 nm illumination had an emission spectrum with a main peak at 480 nm and additional chlorophyll peaks related to the wood substrate. Bioluminescence appeared as a continuous glow that did not show any diel variation. The light production was sensitive to temperature and decreased with temperatures higher or lower than ambient. Bioluminescence intensity was sensitive to hydration, increasing by a factor of 400 immediately after exposure to water and increasing by a factor of 1 million after several hours. This increase may have occurred through dilution of superoxide dismutase, which is a suppressive factor of bioluminescence in fungus tissue. The mycelium typically transports <b>nutritive</b> <b>substances</b> back to the fruiting body. The function of luminescent mycelium may be to increase the intensity of light from the fungus and more effectively attract nocturnal insects and other animals that serve as disseminating vectors for fungal spores...|$|R
40|$|THE {{vitamin content}} of saliva is of {{interest}} {{from a number of}} standpoints. The present work is concerned with the amounts of two of the vitamins which influence growth of some oral lactobacilli. It was prompted by informa-tion now available concerning which of the vitamins are needed for growth of these microorganisms and the limitations imposed upon their growth and acid production by suboptimum levels of a required vitamin. Does saliva contain enough of each of the vitamins required by oral lactobacilli to support sufficient growth and acid production for attainment of a pH level in the 4. 0 to 4. 5 range? General experience with the several lactobacilli used for microbiologic assays and also information from a detailed study of some oral lactobacilli' have shown that very small amounts of required vitamins often are sufficient to support rather extensive cell metabolism, growth, and acid production. Al-though these studies apply more particularly to pure cultures in laboratory media where ample supplies of other <b>nutritive</b> <b>substances</b> are available, the in-formation is nevertheless of some interest from the standpoint of activity o...|$|R
40|$|Organisms (like amoebae, bacteria, etc.), whose {{population}} in an unlimited nutritive medium would grow exponentially with time, behave often as aggressive strain {{with respect to}} higher organisms. Higher organisms provide a medium {{very different from the}} unlimited one considered above; among the various niches where the strain growth is possible, the circulatory system plays a special role. The topological structure of the circulatory system (two interlocked trees addressed to the delivery of O 2 and <b>nutritive</b> <b>substances</b> to all tissues forming the higher organism and to the elimination of metabolic wastes) poses constraints to the growth of the strain population. The immune system is devoted to control and eventually to terminate the strain growing inside the organism. In many cases the immune system is sufficiently effective for that; there is a case, however, for which the immune system generally fails—cancer. In this work, after considering a few elementary properties of the growth of strains and higher organisms, I shall consider how the structure of the latter affects the population dynamics of cancer, and identify a possible reason why the immune system is so ineffective in recognizing cancer cells...|$|R

Physiological research included 18 male lambs crosses Pirot Pramenka x Württemberg x Ile de France, average body mass of approx. 35, 0 kg, divided into three groups. Lambs were fed iso-protein concentrate mixtures which differed in relation to share of protein non-degradable at the rumen level: 43 % (I), 51 % (II) and 58 % (III). Trial results indicate that the level of protein adoption was not under the influence of investigated treatment, considering that digestibility coefficients were: 52, 58 % : 51, 30 % : 55, 12 %. With the increase of share of nondegradable protein in concentrate mixtures (43 : 51 : 58 %), also tendency of increase of fat digestibility was observed: 76, 13 : 77, 98 : 87, 17 %, but decrease of degree of cellulose digestion: 67, 40 : 45, 87 : 22, 39 % and NFE: 83, 87 : 76, 05 : 82, 96 %. Key words: lambs, non-degradable protein, digestibilit...|$|R
