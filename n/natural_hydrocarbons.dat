50|$|According to verses 8-9 of {{the eighteenth}} chapter of the cosmological {{treatise}} known as the Bundahishn, the three preeminent Atar (Great Fires) of ancient Iran - Farnbag, Gushnasp and Burzin Mihr - were brought thither {{on the back of}} the ox Srishok from a place named Khwaniratha, during the reign of the primordial ruler Takhmurup - presumably with his knowledge and possibly at his command. The text of the Bundahishn is not easy to interpret at this point, but seems to mean that a group of men were riding beside the (Caspian?) sea {{on the back of the}} ox, transporting with them a fire altar, upon which were burning the three atar (holy fires). A storm then sprang up and the wind whipped the fire altar off Srishok's back and carried it out to sea. The three holy fires, however, were not quenched but miraculously remained burning on the waters, lighting the men (or passing seafarers?) to their (unspecified) destination.The unusual concept of fire burning in the midst of water is found also in relation to the ancient Indo-Iranian deity Apam Napat and both occurrences of the mythological motif may owe something to early observation of flames (derived from the welling up of <b>natural</b> <b>hydrocarbons)</b> hovering near the surface of the Caspian Sea - more specifically the Southwestern part, exploited currently by the Absheron gas field near Baku in Azerbaijan.|$|E

Hydrocarbon seeps are known to support local benthic productivity, but {{little is known about}} their impact on photosynthetic organisms in the overlying water column. Here we present observations with high temporal and spatial resolution of chlorophyll concentrations in the northern Gulf of Mexico using in situ and shipboard flow-through fluorescence measurements from May to July 2012, as well as an analysis of ocean-colour satellite images from 1997 to 2007.

40|$|This thesis {{outlines}} {{the development of}} four image processing algorithms that combine spectral and spatial information {{for the detection of}} complex objects on the Earth' surface by remote sensing. Complex objects are objects that are composed of several smaller parts. These smaller parts may not be spectrally unique in themselves and lack a statistical coherence, thus creating a problem for image processing techniques that operate per pixel. As the human mind is often capable of processing and recognizing such objects by combining spectral and spatial information, a solution to this problem is an image processing technique that is based on the same qualitative reasoning. The thematic focus is on the detection of <b>natural</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> seepages. <b>Natural</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> seepages are non-unique in both their spectral and spatial characteristics. The infrared spectrum of oil is easily confused with other bituminous surfaces such as asphalt. The dominant anomaly that results from the presence of hydrocarbons is a circular halo of bare soil. The first algorithm measured the shape of a homogeneous object, based on relations between the area and perimeter of an object and its convex hull. The second algorithm was a template matching algorithm that matched a miniature image to a remotely sensed image. Both algorithms were based on existing techniques and were shown to perform well in combining spectral and spatial information. It is however concluded that both technigues were not enough versatile for the detection of seepage-induced halos. The third and fourth algorithms were specifically designed for the detection of seepage-induced halos. The third algorithm aimed to detect spectrally homogeneous pixels on a circle. The fourth algorithm was an extension of the third, aimed to detect incomplete circles with variable radii and was based on Hough transforms. Results showed that these algorithms can detect halos of bare soil that result from seeping hydrocarbons. It was finally concluded that the knowledge-based spatial-spectral approach is an improvement of over traditional remote sensing image processing methods in the detection of anomalies resulting from <b>natural</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> seepages. The concept of the presented algorithms in general and the design of these algorithms in particular allow them to be applied to other remote sensing research...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to perform {{threshold}} NDVI classification over a period of time to determine the condition of the vegetation in Ugwueme town which is influence by <b>natural</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> seepage. To achieve this objective, three Landsat images, Landsat 7 TM+ 1996, Landsat 7 ETM+ 2006 and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS 2016 were used to map the Landcover and monitor NDVI over the investigated areas. The classification analysis shows three vegetation cover classes which include Low class cover, Moderate class cover and High class cover, which were in increasing order of vegetation vigor. The result of the study shows that the category of high NDVI density reduces progressively from 36. 81 % in 1996 to 29. 89 % in 2006 and then to 23. 12 % in 2016. Similarly, the category of moderately NDVI density was also observed to reduce from 36. 56 % in 1996 to 28. 25 % in 2006 and then increase to 28. 70 % in 2016. In contrast to the high and moderate NDVI density category which were decreasing, the category of low NDVI density were visualize to increase from 26. 63 % in 1996 to 41. 86 % in 2006 and then to 48. 18 % in 2016.

The {{aim of this}} study was to characterise SAR ocean features to enable their differentiation from <b>natural</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> seepage slicks. The assessment of SAR ocean features in two NWS study areas is reported in this paper. In the northern NWS, repeat occurrence of ocean features observed on SAR images acquired on three different dates were compared with similar features on a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image acquired 28 minutes before one of the SAR images. Analysis of the images in conjunction with ancillary data confirmed that the ocean features were bathymetric signatures. The same patterns were imaged by TM primarily through specular reflection from sun glint. Correspondence of bathymetric features on the SAR and TM images indicates the potential for extracting bottom topography information from optical images with sun glint. In the central NWS, recurring mesoscale ocean features observed on SAR images were assessed using data collected during a marine survey. Evaluation of the SAR features in conjunction with the regional bathymetry and Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data showed good correlation between the SAR features and zones with strong current flows. Wave-current interaction resulting from modulation of currents by variable bathymetry is the predominant mechanism that generates these SAR features. Recurring local SAR current shear signatures overlying a pelagic ridge also correlated well with field observation and in-situ current measurements. The presence and orientation of the pelagic ridge suggests a strong causal link to current shear signatures observed on SAR. 1...|$|R

Fifteen surface sediment samples were collected using Ekman dredger to monitor the features of aliphatic hydrocarbons in tributaries of Likas River on December 2011.

The results show that northern tributary remained natural with odd carbon number dominance.

The western margin has remained virtually unexplored, with no exploration wells drilled so far. A cost-efficient way to infer the presence of <b>natural</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in the poorly explored regions of the NE Atlantic is the application of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). This study presents four areas, the Western Barents Sea Margin, the Irish Atlantic Margin, East Greenland and Jan Mayen, where clustered oil-slick data indicate possible active oil seepage.

Methods Rats (> 300) received low levels of sodium/potassium thiocyanate (10 or 25 mmol/l) in their drinking water to raise their blood thiocyanate levels, mimicking the elevated levels of blood, salivary and urinary thiocyanate found in smokers. Results Thiocyanate supplements increased the severity of experimental arthritis induced by tailbase injection of (1) Freund's complete adjuvants (mycobacteria plus various adjuvant-active oils), (2) collagen type-II with Freund's incomplete adjuvant (no mycobacteria), (3) the synthetic lipid amine, avridine in an oil and (4) the <b>natural</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> squalene (C 30 H 50) and pristane (C 19 H 40).
