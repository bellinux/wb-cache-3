It is <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> collecting the water bill or land ordinances to construct a new property, it is also about the quality of life and sense of community that is allotted to individuals by their city officials. Rational work is the ability to think cognitively and analytically, while emotional work means to think more practically and with more reason.|$|E

25|$|Simplicity to Friends has {{generally}} been a reference to material possessions. Friends have often limited their possessions to {{what they need to}} live their lives, rather than accumulating luxuries. The testimony is <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> the nature of one's material possessions, but rather also about one's attitude towards these material goods. Many Friends who have been considered exemplary have also been wealthy; their commitment to the testimony, however, led them to use their wealth for spiritual purposes, including aid to the poor and oppressed. On the other hand, some Friends, such as John Woolman, gave up much of their wealth and economic position when they felt it to be a spiritual burden.|$|E
25|$|For Taoists, sex was <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> {{pleasing}} the man. The woman {{also had}} to be stimulated and pleased in order {{to benefit from the}} act of sex. Sex should not happen if one or the other partners desire it more. If sex were performed in this manner, the woman would create more jing, and the man could more easily absorb the jing to increase his own qi. Women were also given a prominent place in the Ishinpō, with the tutor being a woman. One of the reasons women {{had a great deal of}} strength in the act of sex was that they walked away undiminished from the act. The woman had the power to bring forth life, and did not have to worry about ejaculation or refractory period.|$|E
25|$|In Latin and Greek, the Christian celebration was, {{and still}} is, called Pascha (Greek: Πάσχα), a word derived from Aramaic פסחא (Paskha), cognate to Hebrew פֶּסַח (Pesach). The word {{originally}} denoted the Jewish festival known in English as Passover, commemorating the Jewish Exodus from slavery in Egypt. As {{early as the}} 50s of the 1st century, Paul, writing from Ephesus to the Christians in Corinth, applied the term to Christ, and {{it is unlikely that}} the Ephesian and Corinthian Christians were the first to hear Exodus 12 interpreted as speaking about the death of Jesus, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> the Jewish Passover ritual. In most of the non-English speaking world, the feast is known by names derived from Greek and Latin Pascha. Pascha is also a name by which Jesus himself is remembered in the Orthodox Church, especially in connection with his resurrection and with the season of its celebration.|$|E

25|$|Critics of New Urbanism {{have argued}} that its {{environmental}} aspect is too focused on transport and excessive individual mobility. The real problem with the unsustainable nature of modern cities is <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> cars and too much driving - {{it is about the}} entire urban metabolism of the city (of which auto-mobility is {{less than half of the}} overall ecological footprint and accounts for about half of the GHG emissions/carbon footprint). They have also argued that land-use planning can do little to achieve sustainability without regulating the design and associated technology of the actual development within a zoned area. Distances and density are relatively unimportant; it is the total metabolism of the development that determines the environmental impact. Also, the emphasis needs to shift from sustainability to resilience, and the spatial scope from the city to the whole urban region A further criticism is that the New Urbanist project of compacting urban form is a difficult and slow process. In the new global situation, with the horizontal, low-density growth irreversibly dominant, and climate change already happening, it would be wiser to focus efforts on the resilience of whole city-regions, retrofitting the existing sprawl for sustainability and self-sufficiency, and investing heavily in 'green infrastructure'.|$|E

Grahame-Smith met with Keaton in February 2012, [...] "We talked {{for a couple of hours}} and talked about big picture stuff. It's a priority for Warner Bros. It's a priority for Tim.

We don't want to bring a horn section or a violin player out with us. A {{lot of people want to}} hear the old stuff, and that stuff is still just as significant to us." [...] The band also decided to play small theaters instead of stadiums and festivals, as Armstrong explained that they felt better to [...] "go to a place like The Fillmore and The Warfield and know it's actually going to sell out" [...] instead of playing to half-empty large venues. The Nimrod tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments. [...] During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, [...] "I think some people walk away from a Green Day concert with the emotions you would get from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved — where it's <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> the singer.
