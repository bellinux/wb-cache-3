500|$|Despite its popularity, {{the group}} was also criticized sharply, {{especially}} in its heyday. Rolling Stone critic Arthur Schmidt, for example, described the duo's music as [...] "questionable... it exudes a sense of process, and it is slick, and <b>nothing</b> <b>too</b> much happens." [...] New York Times critic Robert Shelton said that the group had [...] "a kind of Mickey Mouse, timid, contrived" [...] approach to music.|$|E

Valo's first acting job came in 1998, when he {{played the role of}} [...] "Lippumies" [...] in the Ilppo Pohjola directed short film Asphalto. Valo has often collaborated with skateboarder and Jackass member Bam Margera, appearing in his films CKY 3, , 411 Productions Presents: 61: The Bam Issue, Jackass Number Two, and , as well as the TV series Viva La Bam. Margera has also used much of HIM's music and the heartagram in his various projects, as well as directed four music videos for the band. In 2008, Valo voiced the character [...] "Moto Moto" [...] in the Finnish dub of [...] When asked about the possibility of becoming an actor, Valo responded by saying [...] "I've had offers in the past. <b>Nothing</b> <b>too</b> big, <b>nothing</b> <b>too</b> interesting. But I'm not an actor. I've always felt that we need to sell about 80 million copies more for me to become an actor, a painter, an opera singer or a TV personality." ...|$|E

500|$|Colbert {{is deeply}} self-centered and takes {{everything}} personally, a trait which {{is reflected in}} his discussion of the news and current events. According to the comedian, [...] "There's <b>nothing</b> <b>too</b> large that doesn't involve him. Every news story is really about him ... Everything he cares about is a news story because he cares about it." [...] This is expressed in his frequent attacks on and feuds with well-known figures such as The Decemberists, Sean Penn, Conan O'Brien, Rain, Barry Manilow, Tony Bennett, and Don Rickles (the latter three of whom beat out Colbert for Best Individual in a Variety or Music Program at the Emmys). The comedian equates these feuds with Bill O'Reilly's culture wars.|$|E

500|$|Although it was {{originally}} thought that Darren Criss would be missing [...] "one and a half episodes", and therefore might return in time to appear in this episode after missing the twelfth one, co-star Chris Colfer initially stated that Criss would not be appearing: [...] "You'll find out how [...] leaves {{for a little bit}} and then comes back, but it’s <b>nothing</b> <b>too</b> bad or serious". He later said that Blaine [...] "is in the episode, it's not in the way you might think"; Criss did return in time to appear in the musical finale. Recurring guest stars who are appearing in the episode include glee club members Sam Evans (Overstreet), Rory Flanagan (McGinty) and Sugar Motta (Lengies), Principal Figgins (Theba), Finn's mother Carole Hudson-Hummel (Rosemont) and stepfather Burt Hummel (O'Malley), former McKinley student Dave Karofsky (Adler) and McKinley football player Shane Tinsley (Tinker).|$|E
500|$|The puppets {{were made}} up of more than 30 {{individual}} components, {{the most important of}} which was the solenoid that synchronised lip movements with the characters' pre-recorded dialogue. This device was positioned inside the head unit; consequently, torsos and limbs appeared relatively small. The puppets' likenesses and mechanics are remembered favourably by puppeteer Wanda Brown, who preferred the Thunderbirds marionettes over the accurately-proportioned ones that first appeared in Captain Scarlet: [...] "The puppets were easier to operate and more enjoyable because they had more character to them... Even some of the more normal-looking faces, such as Scott and Jeff, for me had more character than the puppets in the series that came afterwards." [...] Rimmer speaks positively of the puppets' still being [...] "very much caricatures", since it made them [...] "more lovable and appealing... There was a naive quality about them and <b>nothing</b> <b>too</b> complex." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's Cliff Wheatley gave All Hail the King a 9.4 out of 10. He {{said that}} it's [...] "a {{return to the}} loveable {{personality}} of the hapless Trevor and a step forward for the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has its twists that should satisfy both lovers and haters of Trevor Slattery. But it’s the approach that Pearce takes with the material, from the kung-fu movie style credit sequences to the light-hearted tone that takes a sudden and jarring turn. Kingsley once again shines {{in the role of}} Slattery, aloof and ignorant, but more than happy to slide back into Mandarin mode if it will please his adoring fans. Pearce does go for some of the same jokes from Iron Man 3 in a sort of referential way, but it’s <b>nothing</b> <b>too</b> damaging." [...] Andrew Wheeler of Comics Alliance criticized the way homosexuality was presented in the short, given it was Marvel Studios' first attempt to bring LGBT concepts into the MCU.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of Bookends {{upon its}} release in 1968 were largely positive. Allen Evans of the British {{publication}} New Musical Express (NME) gave the record {{four out of}} five stars and called it [...] "inspiring, descriptive music," [...] while noting the album is [...] "Imaginative and at times confusing to know what the composer is getting at, if anything." [...] Rival newspaper Melody Maker did not use a ratings system, but called Bookends a [...] "thoughtful, clever and well-produced album." [...] Reviewer Chris Welch criticized the songs as [...] "not particularly tuneful," [...] but performed with [...] "Beatles fervour and Beatles conviction," [...] praising the lyricism, opining that [...] "The words capture part of America today, a lot of its sickness and tragedy." [...] In the US, Rolling Stone reviewer Arthur Schmidt wrote that [...] "The music is, for me, questionable, but I've always found their music questionable.

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the meeting Heydrich gave Eichmann firm instructions about what was to appear in the minutes. They were not to be verbatim: Eichmann ensured that <b>nothing</b> <b>too</b> explicit appeared in them. He said at his trial: [...] "How shall I put it — certain over-plain talk and jargon expressions had to be rendered into office language by me". Eichmann condensed his records into a document outlining the purpose of the meeting and the intentions of the regime moving forward. He stated at his trial that it was personally edited by Heydrich, and thus reflected the message he intended the participants to take away from the meeting. Copies of the minutes (known from the German word for [...] "minutes" [...] as the [...] "Wannsee Protocol") were sent by Eichmann to all the participants after the meeting. Most of these copies were destroyed {{at the end of the}} war as participants and other officials sought to cover their tracks. It was not until 1947 that Luther's copy (number 16 out of 30 copies prepared) was found by Robert Kempner, a U.S. prosecutor in the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, in files that had been seized from the German Foreign Office.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics for Wasting Light were {{completed}} {{during the week}} each song was being recorded. Grohl said that the words were [...] "what was on my mind each week", most being [...] "written {{from the perspective of}} who I was then and who I am now", with references to the past, life and death, and [...] "time, but questioning whether it matters at all. There's so much focus on the before that people forget there's an after." [...] The frontman said this was helped by the environment - [...] "a lot of retrospection and introspection and nostalgia going back to the way we used to make records" [...] - and working with Vig again, which [...] "made me think a lot about starting over, and rebirth, and making your way through tragedy and coming out the other side." [...] An example was [...] "I Should Have Known", partially inspired by former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain - [...] "a song like 'I Should Have Known' is about all the people I've lost, not just Kurt". Grohl still tried to do laid-back songs such as [...] "White Limo", which had its lyrics written in just two minutes, specially after Mendel sent him an e-mail saying, [...] "I really like it when you write songs that are silly and mean <b>nothing,</b> <b>too.</b> You don't have to try to write 'Imagine' every time you sit down with a pen and paper".|$|E

500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{also gave}} the episode a {{positive}} review, and opined, [...] "With the dissing of glee club temporarily put on hold, Glee {{the series was}} {{able to have a}} little fun with Tuesday night's episode. And fun it was, with the gang of New Directions taking on Valentine's Day, with flirting, kissing and, of course, singing. Without the bullying, this was a much lighter episode of Glee, and the results gave way to a lot more laughs and story development." [...] He went on to praise Ashley Fink's performance as Lauren Zizes, and said of Puck's falling in love with Lauren, [...] "I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren." [...] Canning ultimately gave the episode an 8.5 out of 10. Wyndham Wyeth of Paste went on to praise the episode for its depiction of relationships in high school, as well as the backing vocals for Salling's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls" [...] by Queen. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review and a grade of [...] "A−": Silly Love Songs' is a fine example of the show at what's very nearly its absolute best. There’s <b>nothing</b> <b>too</b> heady here, but if the show has one tone that it's nailed almost completely consistently, it’s the feeling of teenage romance, the sense that the person you're in love with is the only person you will ever be in love with [...] followed almost immediately by the crippling feeling of heartbreak, of losing that person too soon. Teenage life moves fast and is filled with heightened emotions. And like most musicals, Glee has always been at its best when it embraces those two sides of its characters' lives. As such, 'Silly Love Songs', which is pretty much just an excuse to play around with the show's many romantic pairings among its glee club characters, is a lot of fun without trying all that hard." [...] In conclusion of his review, he wrote, [...] "The best episodes play that elation and devastation off of each other. The worst episodes flounder about for some sort of emotional foothold. But when Glee just tells small, sweet stories about these kids and the ways they're trying to cope with being in high school when they know they're meant for bigger things, it can be terrific. Tonight was one of those episodes, and tonight's episode was terrific. Here's to a good February sweeps." ...|$|E

Even though it's written through the filter of relationships, it's not necessarily specific for relationships.

[...] The crew's final visual effects shot was the death of the demon, and they researched previous films and terminology for how demons' deaths have been designed. They drew inspiration from Hellboy (2004) where they focused on the buildup to the demon's death. Clark said, [...] "We built it over a series of shots so it doesn't just happen in one shot.
