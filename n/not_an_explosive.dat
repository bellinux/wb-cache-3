50|$|The dummy {{device was}} of such sophistication {{that it took}} the Police Rescue & Bomb Disposal Unit almost ten hours to {{ascertain}} that it was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> device, and then to dismantle and remove it, in part with the telephoned assistance of a British Army major who was in Australia for training. The incident, which attracted media attention worldwide, was treated as an extortion investigation.|$|E

50|$|A {{chemical}} explosive is {{a compound}} or mixture which, upon {{the application of}} heat or shock, decomposes or rearranges with extreme rapidity, yielding much gas and heat. Many substances not ordinarily classed as explosives may do one, or even two, of these things. For example, at high temperatures (> 2000 °C) a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen {{can be made to}} react rapidly and yield the gaseous product nitric oxide; yet the mixture is <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> since it does not evolve heat, but rather absorbs heat.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "firearm" [...] {{is defined}} in the Gun Control Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.

[...] Based on Section 921(a)(3), air guns, because they use compressed air and <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> to expel a projectile, do not constitute firearms under Federal law — unless they are manufactured with the frames or receivers of an actual firearm. Accordingly, the domestic sale and possession of air guns is normally unregulated under the Federal firearms laws enforced by ATF.|$|E
5000|$|The {{night of}} the meeting, Taft enters the {{building}} alone, and is told {{by a man named}} Basil Zaharoff, who claims that he works neither for Morgan nor the Guggenheims, to sign a document abolishing the U.S. Constitution. Taft escapes his bonds and kills all of Zaharoff's mercenaries with his bare hands while Zaharoff escapes. Meanwhile, Lincoln, Wilkie and his Secret Service agents discover the superweapon in Yale's underground steam tunnels in the form of capsules of elemental cesium, which was mined in the Wrangells. Believing that the highly explosive cesium would be used to destroy the university with a large explosion, Lincoln collects the capsules to test them. Robert is rescued by a rescue team, and he and Taft return to the Airship. As they fly to Washington, it is deduced that Zaharoff was the [...] "Gentleman from Paris" [...] from the Tesla broadcast, and that Morgan and the Guggenheims could not have been responsible for the kidnapping. After testing the capsules, Lincoln realizes that the superweapon is <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosive,</b> but rather an aerosol; the steam tunnels would have been powered up, and the steam would have carried the extremely corrosive cesium up into New Haven, corroding the town away and killing all its citizens. It is also found that the militiamen who had fought the rescue team were from the Belgian Congo, and Taft and Lincoln travel to the Congo to investigate. The crew finds a house {{in the middle of the}} jungle that belongs to insane, murderous Belgian military officer Leon Rom, who is found to have been the [...] "Gentleman from Boma". The crew kill Rom, but are taken aback by his level of psychosis.|$|E

25|$|TNT {{was first}} {{prepared}} in 1863 by German chemist Julius Wilbrand and originally {{used as a}} yellow dye. Its potential as <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> was <b>not</b> appreciated for several years, mainly {{because it was so}} difficult to detonate and because it was less powerful than alternatives. Its explosive properties were first discovered by another German chemist, Carl Häussermann, in 1891. TNT can be safely poured when liquid into shell cases, and is so insensitive that it was exempted from the UK's Explosives Act 1875 and was <b>not</b> considered <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> for the purposes of manufacture and storage.|$|R
5000|$|The ship {{proceeded}} in a {{sharp turn}} to approach for its landing. That generates extremely high tension in the after part of the ship, {{and especially in the}} center sections close to the stabilizing fins which are braced by shear wires. I can imagine that one of these shear wires parted and caused a rent in a gas cell. If we will assume this further, then what happened subsequently can be fitted in to what observers have testified to here: Gas escaped from the torn cell upwards and filled up the space between the outer cover and the cells in the rear part of the ship, and then this quantity of gas which we have assumed in the hypothesis was ignited by a static spark.Under these conditions, naturally, the gas accumulated between the gas cells and the outer cover must have been a very rich gas. That means it was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> mixture of hydrogen, but more of a pure hydrogen. The loss of gas must have been appreciable.I would like to insert here, because the necessary trimming moments to keep the ship on an even keel were appreciable, and everything apparently happened in the last five or six minutes, that is, during the sharp turn preceding the landing maneuver, that therefore {{there must have been a}} rich gas mixture up there, or possibly pure gas, and such gas does not burn in the form of an explosion. It burns off slowly, particularly because it was in an enclosed space between outer cover and gas cells, and only in the moment when gas cells are burned by the burning off of this gas, then the gas escapes in greater volume, and then the explosions can occur, which have been reported to us at a later stage of the accident by so many witnesses.The rest it is not necessary for me to explain, and in conclusion, I would like to state this appears to me to be a possible explanation, based on weighing all of the testimony that I have heard so far.|$|E
5000|$|Samoilau won {{the first}} two climbs on the course, and as such {{was the leader of}} the {{mountains}} classification pending the conclusion of the stage. As the breakaway neared the top of the third climb, still a good 45 km from the finish of the stage, Robert Kišerlovski set out on the attack alone. After a short while, he attained a two-minute time gap over {{the rest of the morning}} escapees. The main field, rapidly dwindling to a select group of overall contenders and their support riders, began reabsorbing the members of the morning breakaway as the Grossglockner ascent began. Two riders from the breakaway, Cayetano Sarmiento and former race leader Pieter Weening made it to the front of the race and displaced Kiserlovski as the first man on the road with about 13 km to go. Mere minutes later, the group of overall contenders made it to the front of the race. Michele Scarponi and Igor Antón were the first riders on the attack up the Austrian peak, but neither got away. Contador then rode clear, but it was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> attack like he had put in on the stage that ended at Mount Etna, rather a slow, grinding move. The only rider to have an answer was José Rujano. Again unlike the Etna stage, where Rujano struggled mightily simply to hold Contador's wheel, the two were able to work cohesively for the final 8 km of the stage and build a substantial time gap over the remainder of the field. Rujano, having lost five minutes during stage 5 earlier in the race, was an ideal ally for Contador in that had climbing prowess but was not an overall threat. The two approached the finish with the other overall contenders still a full 1 km away. Contador did not contest a sprint for the line, content to have Rujano win the stage. From behind them, the [...] tandem of John Gadret and Hubert Dupont both rode away from the other overall contenders who Contador and Rujano left behind. Gadret crossed the line third, almost a full minute and a half down on Contador and Rujano but, with actual time and time bonus, 17 seconds better than the others.|$|E
40|$|TNO Defence Security and Safety, {{performs}} {{in depth}} research in energetic material responses to several Insensitive Munitions (IM) stimuli like cook-off, bullet-fragment impact and shaped charge impact. The response of energetic materials to these stimuli depends strongly on {{the properties of}} these materials at onset and during an event. This is also true for the so-called low velocity impact, like impact on a spigot or the impact of debris on a munition item. Several years ago the low velocity impact research at TNO started with the development and research with the Ballistic Impact Chamber (BIC) and evaluating the corresponding theories. The Go-NoGo shear rate limit of PBXN- 109 was compared with computational (Autodyn) values of several low (range from 50 - 200 m/s) velocity impact tests such as the UN friability test, Steven impact test, and explosive forming experiments performed at TNO. The {{results showed that the}} shear rate {{is one of the major}} parameters that determine whether or <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> substance is likely to react on impact, especially for the low velocity range. A few years ago TNO has built an impact test based on the well known Steven impact test capable of firing a 48 mm steel projectile with sabot in a 60 mm short barrelled gun. Instead of a flat piece, a confined cylindrically shaped piece of explosive is used making it a munition-like test. Several types of explosives and projectile forms have been tested. PBXes and more conventional explosives like a RDX/wax/graphite and pressed composition B, have been tested. Also a computer model of the impact test has been developed using the hydrocode Autodyn. Besides the shear and shear rate, the amount of “Effective Plastic Strain” and from there on the temperature increase, were calculated. The experimental set-up, the experimental as well as the simulation results and a comparison of those two are presented...|$|E

[...] The idea was adopted, for a time, in Norway and in the mines of the Harz mountains of Germany, although the only available explosive {{at the time was}} gunpowder, which is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> high <b>explosive</b> and hence incapable of producing the shock wave that the shaped-charge effect requires.|$|R
500|$|One of {{the first}} {{witnesses}} with no involvement in Operation Flavius to give evidence to the inquest was Allen Feraday, Principal Scientific Officer at the Royal Armaments Research and Development Establishment.

On cross-examination, he stated that the aerial on the Renault was not the type he would expect {{to be used for}} receiving a detonation signal, adding that the IRA had not been known to use a remote-detonated bomb without a direct line of sight to their target. The following day, [...] "Soldier G" [...] (who had made the determination that the white Renault [...] contained a bomb) told the coroner that he was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>explosives</b> expert, and that his assessment was based on his belief that the vehicle's aerial looked [...] "too new". Dissatisfied, McGrory called his own expert witness—Dr Michael Scott, an expert in radio-controlled detonation—who disagreed with government witnesses that a bomb at the assembly area could have been detonated from the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot, having conducted tests prior to testifying. The government responded by commissioning its own tests, conducted by British Army signallers, which showed that radio communication between the petrol station and the car park was possible, but not guaranteed.|$|R

50|$|A {{projectile}} {{that does}} <b>not</b> contain <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> charge {{or any other}} kind of charge is termed a kinetic projectile, kinetic energy weapon, kinetic energy warhead, kinetic warhead or kinetic penetrator. Typical kinetic energy weapons are blunt projectiles such as rocks and round shots, pointed ones such as arrows, and somewhat pointed ones such as bullets. Among projectiles that do not contain explosives are those launched from railguns, coilguns, and mass drivers, as well as kinetic energy penetrators. All of these weapons work by attaining a high muzzle velocity, or initial velocity, generally up to (hypervelocity), and collide with their targets, converting their kinetic energy into destructive shock waves and heat. Other types of kinetic weapons are accelerated over time by a rocket engine, or by gravity. In either case, it is the kinetic energy of the projectile that destroys its target.|$|R
