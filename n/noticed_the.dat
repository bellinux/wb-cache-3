A passing police officer <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> print and on grounds that it was indecent, insisted it be taken down. The mayor of the city, Carter Harrison, Jr., agreed with the policeman's decision, and deemed that the image could be sold, but should not be displayed in public as children could see it.

5|$|Dogs {{were tied}} with strings around the belly {{and kept in}} the house where they were raised as a food source {{alongside}} domesticated pigs. Seen as a delicacy, they were served during feasts and to the high chiefs. Dogs were less abundant than pigs in the islands, possibly because they were killed while they were young.

5|$|Morgan {{had waited}} until her {{academic}} rank was secure before becoming pregnant. She {{had a son}} in 1923, {{the same year that}} she became a full professor. Colleagues were surprised when she had the baby, as she had not mentioned being pregnant and she hid the physical evidence of her pregnancy with her long laboratory jacket. Morgan remembered the reaction of one male colleague when she told him the news; he said if she had five children like he did, she would have hardly <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> new baby. Morgan's mother moved in with her and cared for the baby so that Morgan could work uninterrupted.|$|E

5|$|The Final Fantasy Legend was {{conceived}} by Nobuyuki Hoshino and developed under director Akitoshi Kawazu {{two years after}} Final Fantasy was released. It was the first installment of the SaGa series in Japan and the first Game Boy game produced by Square. Square president Masafumi Miyamoto requested developers create a Game Boy game after he <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> success of Tetris and the popularity of handheld system. Kawazu and partner Koichi Ishii decided that instead of creating a game similar to Tetris, they would produce what they felt customers desired most: a role-playing game.|$|E

During this time, he read a PC magazine article about a computer game genre in the United States, text adventures. Horii <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> lack of such games in the Japanese market and decided to create an adventure game of his own. Horii also cited the manga authors Tetsuya Chiba, Mitsuru Adachi and Katsuhiro Otomo as influences. The game was developed using the BASIC programming language.|$|E
5|$|After a few warm up gigs {{towards the}} end of April, the group gave a preview concert to the press at Ronnie Scotts, London on 1 May. Realising the opera's {{narrative}} was difficult to understand, Townshend explained a synopsis of the story, before the Who played Tommy all the way through at full stage volume. The next day, the group flew out to New York to start the US tour, with the first gig on 9 May at the Grande Ballroom, Detroit. At the end of May, the group played four nights at the Kinetic Playground, Chicago, and they <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> audience would all stand up at the same time, and stay standing. This indicated that live performances of Tommy had a significant positive response.|$|E

5|$|Although Theophilos's {{principal}} commanders, Theophobos and the Domestic of the Schools Manuel, both advised for {{a surprise}} night attack, the Emperor sided with {{the opinion of the}} other officers and resolved to wait and launch his attack on the next day. The Byzantine army attacked at dawn, and initially made good progress: they drove back one wing of the opposite army, inflicting 3,000 casualties on the Arabs. Near noon, Theophilos resolved to reinforce the other wing, and detached 2,000 Byzantines and the Kurdish contingent to do so, abandoning his post and passing behind his own army's lines. At this point, however, Afshin launched his Turkish horse-archers in a ferocious counter-attack which stymied the Byzantine advance and allowed the Arab forces to regroup. The Byzantine troops then <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> emperor's absence, and, thinking he had been killed, began to waver. This soon turned into a disorderly retreat; some men fled as far as Constantinople, bringing with them the rumour that the Emperor had been killed. Some units, however, were apparently able to retreat in good order and assemble at a place called Chiliokomon.|$|E
5|$|As 9 Staffel {{crossed the}} coast they were fired at by Royal Navy patrol boats. The machine gun fire was ineffective. However, the Royal Observer Corps Post K3, {{situated}} {{on top of}} Beachy Head, spotted the Dorniers.
