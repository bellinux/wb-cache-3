40|$|A hybrid infrared-hot gas {{heat source}} has been {{developed}} and tested for the NASA Langley Tow Placement Facility. The IR heat source provides supplemental heat to the nip region. The additional heat is intended to {{reduce the need for}} conduction heating by the compaction roller, which causes (he roller to stick to the panel surface. Initial bench scale testing was performed to identify the most effective means of focusing IR energy into the nip region. A compact lamp and reflector that placed the lamp as close to the <b>nip</b> <b>point</b> as possible was found to deliver the highest heat flux in the nip region. A prototype heater was installed on the NASA Langley tow placement robot. Panels placed with a 400 C (sticking) compaction roller gave DCB initiation toughness numbers comparable to those reported for autoclave processed panels but were found to have unexpectedly high void contents. Placement with compaction roller temperatures that prevented roller sticking resulted in mode I fracture toughness approximately 70 % that reported for autoclave processed panels. The variability in strength among specimens placed with reduced roller temperature was found to be greatly reduced, which implies that use of supplemental <b>nip</b> <b>point</b> heat may improve the robustness of the tow placement process. Use of the IR heat source permitted placement with a compaction roller temperature that would have resulted in negligible interfacial strength with the hot gas torch alone.

The Common-Reflection- Surface (CRS) stack method is a new processing technique to simulate zero-offset (ZO) seismic sections from multi-coverage seismic data. It is based on a second-order hyperbolic paraxial traveltime approximation referred to a central normal ray. By considering a planar measurement surface, the CRS stacking operator is defined by means of three parameters, namely the emergence angle of the normal ray, the curvature of the normal incidence <b>point</b> (<b>NIP)</b> wave, and the curvature of the normal (N) wave. In this paper the 2 -D ZO CRS stack method is modified in order to consider effects due to the smooth topography. By means of this new CRS formalism, we obtain a high resolution ZO seismic section, without applying static corrections.

40|$|This {{investigation}} was into {{the processing of}} long, fine Australian cotton in high-mass throughput saw gins. The research was conducted at the Auscott Narrabri gin in New South Wales, Australia using Australian cotton with a UHML of 30. 9 mm and 31. 8 mm, with a micronaire value of 3. 85. Mass production rates trials ranged between 3200 and 3800 kg/h of lint. In particular, the feed and discharge of seed was investigated, and the results demonstrate that the gin stand motor load frequently fluctuates due to the varying mass input of seed cotton. Furthermore, the distribution of seed cotton presented to the gin stand is laterally non-uniform. It is thought that a non-uniform vertical feed results in elevated nep and seed-coat nep due to the changing seed-roll density. The source of the uneven lateral distribution of seed cotton to the gin stand lies within the design of distributor conveyor, which feeds seed cotton to the gin stand. Because of the high speed required to transport seed cotton in the conveyor distributor, the drop zone of seed cotton to each feed hopper is overshot. The trailing edge of the hopper is further seed cotton deficient. The auger blade together with the auger housing create a <b>nip</b> <b>point</b> allowing for the seed cotton to be {{pulled out of the}} feed hopper. Methods to overcome the problem were trialled,, including redirecting the seed cotton on the gin stand apron, modifying the conveyor distributor, and increasing the seed cotton mass in the affected areas to improve the uniformity of the seed roll density. The uneven input of seed cotton creates an uneven output of fuzzy seed. The region of the gin stand most affected was the corresponding delivery side. This output region expelled up to four times more fuzzy seed than other expulsion areas of the gin stand. The uneven fuzzy seed expulsion is attributed to the seed roll density, as the roll box is unevenly loaded with incoming seed cotton. Uneven loading of seed cotton creates areas within the roll box that experience a reduction in density, and this creates a movement of fuzzy seed from high-density areas to the neighbouring lower-density areas. Therefore, high levels of fuzzy seed expulsion occur in areas of lesser density. The output distribution curve of fuzzy seed equates approximately to the inverse curve of the seed cotton input. Elongation of the leading and trailing edge angle on the hopper of the gin stand was not finalised because of time constraints. This method is believed to enable the elimination of the uneven seed roll. The elongation length may be required up to 60 cm. Overcoming the uneven vertical flow can be achieved through electrical settings of the feed hopper motor. Eliminating the uneven lateral feed has the potential to increase production by approximately 12 per cent. It is envisaged that tight seed roll occurrence will reduce with an evenly loaded seed roll, further increasing productivity. Saw blade wear should also reduce, together with the event of fires as a result of tight seed rolls. Roll box geometry was also investigated, and this highlighted frictional properties, mechanical interaction of the saw teeth, and seed roll densities. Decreasing the time that the seed cotton is present in the roll box would reduce mechanical interaction. Further, the lint mass production rate was investigated, and results indicated that reducing mass production rates decreased nep and seed-coat nep because of a decrease in the seed roll density. Research was conducted on Continental Eagle 161 gin stands. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{number of}} {{through-thickness}} integration <b>points</b> (<b>NIP)</b> required for accurate springback analysis following sheet forming simulation {{is the subject}} of confusion and controversy. Li and Wagoner recommended, in 1999, based on a finite element analysis (FEA) of draw-bending springback, the use of 25 integration points (IP). They also reported that up to 51 IP could be required to obtain springback solutions with accuracies of 1 %. Several researchers since then have reported that NIP between 5 and 11 are adequate, and even that 7 or 9 IP are optimal, with reduced accuracy for more IP. These apparent contradictions are addressed with an analytical model of elasto-plastic bending under tension, followed by elastic springback. The fractional error in the evaluated bending moment, which is equal to the fractional error in springback, was determined by comparing three numerical integration schemes, with various NIP, to the closed-form result. The results illustrate the oscillatory nature of numerical integration error with small parametric changes, such that fortuitous agreement can be obtained in isolated simulations where the number of integration points is inadequate. The concept of an assured error limit is introduced as well as a maximum error limit (for a range of generally unknown sheet tensions). The assured error limit varies with the integration scheme, NIP, bending ratio (R/t), and sheet tension. Guidelines for the number of integration points required for given error tolerances are reported to allow practitioners to choose numerical parameters appropriately...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{analysis}} of the catalytic activity of gold nanoparticles in aqueous solution as a function of temperature. As a model reaction, the reduction of p nitrophenol Nip by sodium borohydride BH 4 is used. The gold nanoparticles are immobilized on cationic spherical polyelectrolyte brushes that ensure their stability against aggregation. High resolution transmission electron microscopy shows that the Au nanoparticles are faceted nanocrystals. The average size of the nanoparticles is 2. 2 nm, and the total surface area of all nanoparticles could be determined precisely and was used in the subsequent kinetic analysis. Kinetic data have been obtained between 10 and 30 C by monitoring the concentrations of Nip and BH 4 by UV vis spectroscopy. The reaction starts after an induction time t 0, and the subsequent stationary phase yields the apparent reaction rate, kapp. All kinetic data could be modeled in terms of the Langmuir Hinshelwood model; that is, both reactants must be adsorbed onto the surface to react. The analysis of the temperature dependence of kapp leads to the heat of adsorption of both Nip and BH 4 and the surface of the Au nanoparticles. Moreover, the true activation energy of the surface reaction is obtained. The analysis of t 0 reveals clearly that the induction period is not related to the limitations due to diffusion but to the surface restructuring of the Au nanoparticles induced by the adsorbed Nip.

Nor is it known, if blood O 2 carrying capacity affects the tissue-specific oxygenation responses. Thus, we investigated alveolar gas exchange and tissue (m. vastus lateralis, m. biceps brachii, cerebral cortex) oxygenation during incremental treadmill exercise until volitional fatigue, and their associations with blood O 2 carrying capacity in 22 healthy men. Alveolar gas exchange was measured, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to monitor relative concentration changes in oxy- (Î[O 2 Hb]), deoxy- (Î[HHb]) and total hemoglobin (Î[tHb]), and tissue saturation index (TSI). NIRS inflection <b>points</b> (<b>NIP),</b> reflecting changes in tissue-specific oxygenation, were determined and their coincidence with ventilatory thresholds (anaerobic threshold (AT), respiratory compensation point (RC); V-slope method) was examined. Blood O 2 carrying capacity (total hemoglobin mass (tHb-mass)) was determined with the CO-rebreathing method. In all tissues, NIPs coincided with AT, whereas RC was followed by NIPs. High tHb-mass associated with leg muscle deoxygenation at peak exercise (e. g., Î[HHb] from baseline walking to peak exercise vs. tHb-mass: r = 0. 64, p < 0. 01), but not with arm muscle- or cerebral deoxygenation. In conclusion, regional tissue oxygenation was characterized by inflection points, and tissue oxygenation in relation to alveolar gas exchange during incremental treadmill exercise resembled previous findings made during incremental cycling. It was also found out, that O 2 delivery to less active m. biceps brachii may be limited by an accelerated increase in ventilation at high running intensities. In addition, high capacity for blood O 2 carrying {{was associated with a}} high level of m. vastus lateralis deoxygenation at peak exercise...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} such as load-deflection {{relationship and}} {{modulus of rigidity}} on the twisting of yarn in stationary state have been studied by many researchers. But on the twisting of yarn in rnnning state there are few fundamental studies, experimental or theoretical, except Tobisch 2 Ì 7 s theory. Tobisch derived his theory {{on the assumption that}} the number of twists of yarn per unit length, or twist density, was uniform everywhere in the twisting field, but this is true only when the delivery velocity is very small or the internal friction of yarn is negligible. The author has made theoretical and experimental studies on the twisting of yarn in running state, considering it as a visco-elastic body made of homogeneous and uniform materials. The studies may be briefly summerized in the following outline. ã(1) A yarn of total length L is fixed at both ends. This yarn is divided into two parts, the length l of it being twisted and the other length L-l free from twisting. If a point fixed between these two parts is suddenly released, twisting will be transmitted to the untwisted part. The theory of this transient transmission of twisting has been treated by solving the following partial differential equation :ãp(â^ 2 Î¸/ât^ 2) = G(â^ 2 Î¸/âx^ 2) + Î·(â^ 3 Î¸/âtâx^ 2) ãwhere p = the density of yarnãÎ¸ = angle of torsion at x along the yarnãt = time G = modulus of rigidity of yarn. ãÎ· = tangential coefficient of viscosity at the cross section of yarn. ãIn the case under consideration, let the angles of torsion along the yarn and at the end of the lenght l be Î and Î¸_ 0 respectively. Then the following relation holds : Î¸=Î-Î¸_(0 x) /L. The solution of the above differential equation by the use of this relation and initial and boundary conditions in this case has shown that the twist density of yarn transmitted to the untwisted part is exponentially increased with time and approaches to Î¸_ 0 /L. ã(2) A high speed camera by which 64 pictures could be taken per second was used in order to confirm the above theory. The results measured coincided satisfactorily with the theory. ã(3) When the yarn was fixed at one end and free at the other and the twisting moment was applied at the free end, the above differential equation was solved under the initial and boundary conditions in this case. The twist density of yarn in this transient case also approaches exponentially to Î¸_ 0 /L with time. ã(4) In the running yarn, the following transformation of coordinates was used : x=Î¾+vt, where v is the velocity of the running yarn, x is a fixed coordinate in yarn and Î¾ is in space. By solving this transformed equation, it has been shown that the twist density of running yarn with only internal friction is in steady state exponentially decreased from the twisting element, say the aperture of flyer, to the <b>nip</b> <b>point</b> of delivery roller. ã(5) Also by the solution of the above transformed equation, Ball 2 Ì 7 s distribution diagram of twist in the twisting fields of the ring frame and mule has proved to be the distributed one in a case when the yarn is considered as a visco-elastic body with solid friction. ã(6) In the yarn with plasticity, the twisting field is divied into two Zones : an elastic zone Î¾= 0 -Î¾_ 1. and a plastic zone Î¾=Î¾_ 1 -L. The equations of twist density in elastic and plastic zones have been derived under considerations of the boundary conditions. An experiment of twisting rayon yarn with the flyer frame showed that these twe zones occurred and could be explained by substituting appropriate numerical values into the above derived equations. ã(7) When the internal friction of yarn is negligible or the delivery velocity of yarn is very small, Tobisch 2 Ì 7 s theory is applicable. So, in such a state, the double twisting principle of tyre cord has been analyzed by this theory. ã(8) The re-distribution of twists in the twisting field by the invasion of twisted yarn into the untwisted field or by its regression from the twisting field with the introduction of untwisted yarn is occasionally important in spinning operation, especially in false twisting of worsted spinning and rotating funnel of high draft system in cotton spinning. The state of this re-distribution was experimentally studied by photographing the twisting operation in one twisting field, and the results measured could be qualitatively explained by the above described theorics. ã(9) The permanent deformations of twisted yarn set by steam or initially applied tension were studied by measuring the free rotating angle about the axis of the yarn loaded axially. According to these experiments, the permanent sets are 0 - 28...|$|E
