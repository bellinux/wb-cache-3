40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the usefulness of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the evaluation of renal function, with particular attention to the effects of water load. Ten healthy volunteers underwent dynamic MR imaging after an injection of gadolinium diethylene-triaminepenta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA) as a contrast agent to evaluate renal function by the following four methods: the positive method [longitudinal relaxation time (T 1) shortening is the dominant effect], the <b>negative</b> <b>method</b> [transverse relaxation time (T 2) shortening is the dominant effect] and two intermediate methods by switching the Gd-DTPA concentrations used in the positive and negative methods. A prolonged cortical peak time and a reduced medullary peak level were observed by the positive method under a dehydrated condition, suggesting that these variables were slightly influenced by Gd-DTPA concentrated in the medulla. By the <b>negative</b> <b>method,</b> low signals due to T 2 * (T 2 * is the effective transverse relaxation time, typically shorter than T 2) shortening appeared in the medulla under normal conditions, but these signals were unclear when the subject was under an overhydrated condition. These results indicate that water metabolism, in addition to imaging parameters and Gd-DTPA dose levels, should be considered when renal function is evaluated by dynamic MR imaging. Analysis of both the pattern of MR images and the time-signal intensity curves may be useful in the evaluation of renal function. The results also indicate that the positive method is preferred when the patient is overhydrated as it allows the evaluation of the local renal kinetic function by recording changes in the regional contrast agent levels. </p...|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} evaluates {{the stability of}} self-esteem as assessed by a daily version of the Rosenberg (Society and the adolescent self-image, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1965) general self-esteem scale (RGSE). The scale was administered to 391 undergraduates for five consecutive days. The longitudinal {{data were analyzed using}} the integrated LC-LSTM framework that allowed us to evaluate: (1) the measurement invariance of the RGSE, (2) its stability and change across the 5 -day assessment period, (3) the amount of variance attributable to stable and transitory latent factors, and (4) the criterion-related validity of these factors. Results provided evidence for measurement invariance, mean-level stability, and rank-order stability of daily self-esteem. Latent state-trait analyses revealed that variances in scores of the RGSE can be decomposed into six components: stable self-esteem (40 %), ephemeral (or temporal-state) variance (36 %), stable <b>negative</b> <b>method</b> variance (9 %), stable positive method variance (4 %), specific variance (1 %) and random error variance (10 %).

40|$|Although {{several studies}} have {{investigated}} {{the factor structure of}} the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), there are still disagreements about it. The present study assessed: a) the goodness of fit of nine competing factor models for the RSES using data from a clinical sample of 855 women with eating/weight disorders; and b) its measurement invariance across clinical and non-clinical (n =  943) samples. A bifactor model, with a general self-esteem factor, plus positive and <b>negative</b> <b>method</b> factors, provided a better fit with the data than alternative models. However, the results showed the high reliability of the general self-esteem factor, and a low reliability of the two method factors.

The factor variances and means differed significantly across groups.

40|$|Background The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) has {{traditionally}} been conceptualised as a unidimensional measure of self-esteem, but empirical evidence is equivocal, with some studies supporting a one-factor solution and others favouring multidimensional models. Participants and procedure The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the factor structure, factorial invariance and composite reliability of the RSES within a European sample of children affected by parental imprisonment (N = 724). The study specified and tested six alternative factor models using conventional confirmatory factor analytic (CFA) techniques and a confirmatory bifactor modelling approach. Results The RSES was most effectively represented by a bifactor model including a general self-esteem factor comprising all ten scale items and separate method effects for the positively and negatively phrased items. This model was found to be factorially invariant among boys and girls. Composite reliability indicated good internal consistency for the general self-esteem dimension but slightly less so for the positive and <b>negative</b> <b>method</b> effects. Conclusions It follows that the calculation of a total RSES score is appropriate for children of prisoners, providing that the presence of method effects is taken into consideration to avoid giving rise to false interpretations.

40|$|Although electrocardiograms {{were taken}} from the cesophagus as long ago as 1906 (by Cremer) it was Brown (1936) who first showed the {{possibilities}} of the method and made the lead of clinical significance. The cesophagus is in close relation to the left auricle for about 5 cm. below the level of the fifth dorsal vertebra; lower down it is in relationship to the right auricle and the dia-phragmatic surface of the ventricles. Thus the cesophageal electrocardiogram can be divided into three sectors. The supra-auricular complexes resemble those in lead VR with negative P waves. At the auricular level P waves are replaced by intrinsicoid deflections which are usually much greater in amplitude than are found in any other lead. At the ventricular level P is positive and the ventri-cular complexes are like those in lead VF. Between the auricular and ventricular levels there is a transitional zone of varying depth, in which the P waves are becoming peaked, Q waves appear, and T may be <b>negative.</b> <b>Method.</b> An electrode was constructed from a Ryle's duodenal tube, as described by Butter-worth and Poindexter (1946), with a tip of German silver substituted for the rubber end.

A split-plot {{multivariate analysis of}} covariance, controlling for salivary flow rate, did not support a causal link between induced mood alone and change in SIgA concentration. The effect of induced mood on blood pressure and heart rate was also examined. There were no significant main effects, but gender interacted with mood induction such that females experienced an increase in blood pressure in the positive mood induction condition. There was no significant effect of method of mood induction on SIgA, blood pressure, or heart rate. Stable personality traits, however, moderated the effects of mood induction. Persons who scored higher on depression and neuroticism, and lower on positive affect had significantly higher SIgA concentrations in the negative mood condition. There were no significant effects of personality traits on SIgA levels in the positive mood condition, nor did they interact with induced mood to change blood pressure or heart rate. These data suggest that although SIgA concentration may {{not be subject to}} short-term laboratory mood manipulations alone, changes in SIgA concentration may be associated with an interaction of stable personality traits and mood state, especially in the case induced negative mood...|$|E
