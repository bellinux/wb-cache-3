40|$|In {{containerised}} transport chains where {{activities are}} more and more embedded, <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> are sometimes involved in the implementation of terminal handling services and/or hinterland transport. The sectorial framework adopted by existing litterature in maritime transport explains the main forces of <b>shipping</b> <b>lines?</b> interest for port and hinterland activities. But some questions remain. What are the conditions of hinterland involvement of some <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> and not others ? Why are some ports and hinterland adapted for the enlargement of scopes of <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> and not others ? Confronting theories of proximity dynamics and regional economics with the hinterland involvement of <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> in North range ports and their hinterland, the paper underlines the necessity to consider simulnaneously caracteristics of maritime industry, <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> which enlarge their scopes and territories which deserve as mean of involvement. territorialization, <b>shipping</b> <b>lines,</b> conteneurization, ports, hinterland...|$|R
40|$|The present era of {{globalization}} and regional competition has witnessed the increasing influence of the global operations of the <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> on port development and the declining monopoly of ports. This warrants {{the need for an}} identification of the port selection criteria {{from the perspective of the}} <b>shipping</b> <b>lines.</b> Hence, an attempt is made to determine the port choice from the perspective of the <b>shipping</b> <b>lines.</b> Moreover, most port operators have designed their strategies based on the 'stated preference' of the <b>shipping</b> <b>lines.</b> However, the stated preference approach can have several shortcomings such as the <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> would tend to overstate their demands for services at the port. This directs for an examination of the port choice of the <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> based on a revealed preference approach. The 'revealed preference' approach aims at judging the port choice of <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> purely from their 'actions' rather than what they actually 'state'. The empirical study in this article is based on a survey conducted among major <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> operating in Singapore and Malaysia. The findings have shown port charges and wide range of port services to be the only significant factors in their port choice. Moreover, the results show no consistency between the stated and revealed preferences of <b>shipping</b> <b>lines.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to fierce competition of container cargo transportation markets, cooperation {{has become the}} mainstream of this era. Consolidation of shipping routes, globalization of <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> and cooperation of port operators have emerged. This paper adopts a game theory approach to modelling consolidation of <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> and ports, and establishes a two-stage game scenario with two ports and multiple <b>shipping</b> <b>lines.</b> In the first stage, <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> and ports decide their cooperative strategies based on their prediction. The second stage is modelled as a static game with the coalition and the others that have not joined the coalition. Numerical analysis is conducted to obtain the main properties of some key parameters {{as well as the}} best choices of <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> and ports. The results show that the cooperation strategy of <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> strongly depends on the supply and demand situation of ships. The port which collaborates with <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> will have a significant decrease in port charges, which creates an advantage of gaining more port calls and demand, but it will have a limited effect on the charge of the other port. The cooperation may result in a loss to the port, thus reallocation of profit is needed to maintain the coalition. MSc in Logistics and Transport Managemen...|$|R

30|$|The {{transshipment}} {{hub port}} selection decision {{is critical for}} <b>shipping</b> <b>lines,</b> since the process involves determining a range of criteria, and for port service providers, since these decisions directly influence their business opportunities.

40|$|The {{container}} handling rates at ports are input for container shipping operations planning by <b>shipping</b> <b>lines.</b> The handling rates are unilaterally determined by port operators. This article {{points out that}} it may be possible for port operators to provide higher handling rates at some additional costs. The higher handling rates will enable ships to have more time sailing at sea, leading to less fuel consumption. The reduction in fuel costs for <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> may be more significant than the additional costs incurred by port operators. We therefore propose a practical and easy-to-implement collaborative mechanism between <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> and port operators, where the <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> compensate the port operators for their additional costs. As a result, the overall efficiency of container transportation is improved. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R
