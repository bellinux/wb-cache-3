5|$|As {{with other}} Bond novels, such as Casino Royale, {{gambling}} is a theme, {{with not only}} golf {{as part of the}} novel, but opening with the canasta game as well. Raymond Benson identified times in the novel when Bond's investigation of Goldfinger was a gamble too and cites Bond tossing a coin to decide on his tactics in relation to his quarry. Once more (as with Live and Let Die and Dr. <b>No)</b> <b>it</b> is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what turns out to be an American problem and this can be seen as Fleming's reaction to the lack of US support over the Suez Crisis in 1956 as well as Bond's warning to Goldfinger not to underestimate the English.|$|E
5|$|For {{three of}} the novels, Goldfinger, Live and Let Die and Dr. <b>No,</b> <b>it</b> is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what {{turns out to be}} an American problem, and Black points out that {{although}} it is American assets that are under threat in Dr. No, a British agent and a British warship, HMS Narvik, are sent with British soldiers to the island {{at the end of the}} novel to settle the matter. Fleming became increasingly jaundiced about America, and his comments in the penultimate novel You Only Live Twice reflect this; Bond's responses to Tanaka's comments reflect the declining relationship between Britain and America—in sharp contrast to the warm, co-operative relationship between Bond and Leiter in the earlier books.|$|E
5|$|The {{sixth and}} final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, {{was written in}} 1924–25. After {{suffering}} a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; {{in an article in}} Politiken on 9 November 1925 he wrote: If I could live my life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art out of my head and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end... What use is it to me that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve. <b>No,</b> <b>it</b> is no enviable fate to be an artist.|$|E

25|$|The {{conversion}} of ammonium to nitrate is performed primarily by soil-living bacteria and other nitrifying bacteria. In the primary stage of nitrification, the oxidation of ammonium (NH) is performed by bacteria {{such as the}} Nitrosomonas species, which converts ammonia to nitrites (NO). Other bacterial species such as Nitrobacter, {{are responsible for the}} oxidation of the nitrites (NO) into nitrates (<b>NO).</b> <b>It</b> is important for the ammonia (NH) to be converted to nitrates or nitrites because ammonia gas is toxic to plants.|$|E
25|$|Due to the show's popularity, a {{game show}} segment was {{launched}} by the network and was called Pinoy Big Brother: Yes or <b>No.</b> <b>It</b> was one which uses the board game format and uses questions related to the show as well as ABS-CBN's other primetime soap operas. The show was hosted by Mariel Rodriguez and it promised to give a daily studio contestant up to twenty five thousand pesos. After a week as {{a segment of the}} show, it became a separate early afternoon game show on October 24, 2005. This show was terminated after the first season ended.|$|E

25|$|Peter R. Orszag, {{the then}} {{director}} of the CBO, argued in June 2008 that the Medicare program as currently structured is unsustainable without significant reform, as tax revenues dedicated to the program are not sufficient to cover its rapidly increasing expenditures. According to the CBO, spending on Medicare will grow from $485 billion during 2009 to $879 billion by 2018. President Obama said at a White House news conference on July 22 that, without changes, the system is guaranteed “to basically break the federal budget”. He argued {{that it is necessary}} to cut wasteful spending which is known to exist (over-testing, <b>no</b> <b>IT,</b> lack of co-ordination, hospital re-admissions) in order to cut costs in order to protect Medicare in the future and cut the projected national deficit.|$|E
25|$|In 1894, Boyce {{was elected}} to the Idaho state senate as a Populist from Shoshone County, Idaho. Boyce battled for the eight-hour day for miners, the {{establishment}} of an arbitration board to settle labor disputes, and an investigation of the 1892 mining war. He objected to appropriations for the state militia, charging that it was a tool used by the state and mine owners to suppress labor. He called for legislation to forbid employment of aliens, to outlaw yellow-dog contracts and prohibit company stores. In {{one of the most dramatic}} speeches he ever made, Boyce denounced the blacklist:Senate bill fifty six provides for no class, no special legislation, but under its provisions those relentless persecutors, known as corporations, are prevented when they discharge an employee from following him with a blacklist and depriving him of the means of earning an honest living in another part of the state….Why do you not produce some argument against it to show that it should not become a law? <b>No,</b> <b>it</b> is not necessary: you of the Republican party have the votes to kill the bill and that is all you desire. But remember these words: the laboring men of Idaho have asked you for bread and you give them a stone: we ask you for justice and you treat us with scorn, but the day is fast approaching when your action will be condemned by every man who has one drop of manly blood in his veins.|$|E
500|$|Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered was {{developed}} by Raven Software, who had developed multiplayer modes for several Call of Duty titles in the past, and executive produced by Infinity Ward. Development of the game began in early 2015, {{as a result of}} an online petition signed by fans of Modern Warfare. After it was brought to their attention, Activision approached Raven Software to remaster the game, to which Raven's studio director David Pellas recalled that [...] "not a single person at Raven turned away and said <b>no.</b> <b>It</b> was a universal, [...] "yeah, we’re there."" ...|$|E

It's the spirit of who I am, as a man, an actor, a father. It's where I come from." [...] Brosnan was asked by a fan if it annoyed him when people get his nationality confused. He said: [...] "It amuses me in some respects that they should confuse me with an Englishman when I'm dyed-in-the-wool, born and bred Irishman... I don't necessarily fly under any flag.

"The meeting {{which took}} place after Easter in 1967 lasted two minutes … I told him in a few words the purpose of my visit: for him to bless the Congregation of the Holy Ghost which was due to hold an {{extraordinary}} General Chapter meeting … Then Padre Pio cried out. 'Me, bless an archbishop, no, <b>no,</b> <b>it</b> is you who should be blessing me!' And he bowed, to receive the blessing. I blessed him, he kissed my ring and continued {{on his way to}} the confessional... That was the whole of the meeting, no more, no less..." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress Jolene Blalock (T'Pol) {{criticized the}} early stories as boring and lacking {{intriguing}} content. She felt that early Enterprise scripts ignored basic tenets of Star Trek chronology, and offered [...] "revealing costumes instead of character development". UPN executives {{stated that the}} male-oriented episodes of Enterprise did not mesh with the viewership of its other top shows, such as Top Model and Veronica Mars. Brannon Braga suggested {{that the reason for}} the cancellation was viewer fatigue, noting that [...] "after 18 years and 624 hours of Star Trek, the audience began to {{have a little bit of}} overkill." [...] Fans, meanwhile, criticized Berman and Braga for ignoring Star Trek canon and refusing to fix their shows. Michael Hinman, news coordinator for SyFy Portal, stated that in addition to the oversaturation of Star Trek, there [...] "also is an oversaturation of Braga and Berman. [...] They couldn't sit back and say, 'You know, we just can't keep this fresh.' <b>No,</b> <b>it</b> was more about their stupid egos, and their nonsensical 'Even if it's broke, don't fix it' attitude." [...] Braga defended the series, noting that The Next Generation faced little competition from other science fiction shows, while Enterprise had to contend with a plethora of shows such as Battlestar Galactica.|$|E

500|$|Eastwood said he {{has always}} opposed war and is a pragmatic Libertarian rather than a red-meat Republican. Eastwood further {{explained}} his anti-war stance by saying [...] "I was {{a child growing up}} during World War II. That {{was supposed to be the}} one to end all wars. And four years later, I was standing at the draft board being drafted during the Korean conflict, and then after that there was Vietnam, and it goes on and on forever … I just wonder … does this ever stop? And <b>no,</b> <b>it</b> doesn't. So each time we get in these conflicts, it deserves a lot of thought before we go wading in or wading out. Going in or coming out. It needs a better thought process, I think." [...] Furthermore, Eastwood's 2014 movie American Sniper was met with strong critical praise, especially from many Republicans who called it a pro-War on Terror, pro-Republican, and patriotic film; Eastwood responded by saying that such notions represented a [...] "stupid analysis" [...] and that the movie had nothing to do with political parties. Eastwood responded to critics of American Sniper by saying his film was [...] "the biggest anti-war statement any film can make", and that the film depicts [...] "the fact of what [...] does to the family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did" [...] and [...] "what it (war) does to the people left behind." ...|$|E
500|$|After its release, {{the book}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews. It was listed by Rolling Stone {{as one of}} the 10 Best Music Books in 2016. Jason Diamond from the publication reviewed it and found that the book gave a [...] "fuller, weirder and more interesting overview of Madonna" [...] than was already present in previous works about her. He complimented the author's [...] "riveting" [...] way of presenting the past figures from Bay City associated with the singer as well as Simone's own transition into indie music. Jennifer Levin from The Santa Fe New Mexican commended Simone's [...] "wit and grace" [...] in reporting Bay City's troubled relationship with Madonna, including the political agenda surrounding her. She noted that the story found its footing at the point in the book where the author wrote about Flying Wedge (in the last chapter). Writing for PopMatters, Megan Volpert rated the book 7 out of 10 stars, and described it as [...] "excellent", suggesting it as an important addition to modern cultural criticism. She commended Simone's writing and her courage to pick up an unusual subject for the book. Volpert commented, [...] "Does the world need one more half-baked biographical update on Madonna? <b>No,</b> <b>it</b> does not. What the world does need is Simone's productively clear-eyed assessment of her own musical and journalistic failures, [...] for the detours unavoidably provoked by fame and fandom," [...] concluded the review.|$|E
