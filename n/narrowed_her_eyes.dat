60|$|For {{a quarter}} of a minute Barbara looked at Nevada with a strange steadfastness; and then a smile so small that it widened her mouth only the sixteenth part of an inch, and <b>narrowed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> no more than a twentieth, flashed like an {{inspired}} thought across her face.|$|E
60|$|Sheila {{carefully}} {{opened the}} door a few inches. She laid the blue envelope on the dressing-table at her husband's elbow. 'You had better perhaps count it,' {{she said in a}} low voice--'forty in notes, the rest in gold,' and <b>narrowed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> beneath her veil upon her husband's very peculiar method of forgetting his responsibilities.|$|E

2500|$|The woman rests {{her right}} cheek {{lightly on the}} back of her right hand and <b>narrows</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> in thought. [...] In line with the theme of the series, she must be pondering love—perhaps an illegitimate lover or old {{memories}} of love. [...] Some consider it the finest example from the series, and others suggest the picture pairs with Fukaku Shinobu Koi.|$|R
60|$|Why {{did this}} family somehow {{make him feel}} inferior? The way she sat there {{and looked at him}} so calmly! Still more the way she <b>narrowed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and {{wrinkled}} her lips, as if rather malicious thoughts were rising in her soul! Her hair, as is the way of fine, soft, almost indigo-colored hair, was already showing threads of silver; her whole face and figure thinner than he had remembered. But a striking woman still--with wonderful eyes! Her dress--Felix had scanned many a crank in his day--was not so alarming as it had once seemed to Clara; its coarse-woven, deep-blue linen and needle-worked yoke were pleasing to him, and he could hardly take his gaze from the kingfisher-blue band or fillet that she wore round that silver-threaded black hair.|$|E
50|$|Teena {{frequently}} {{played the}} role of the straight man in the strip's humor, seeming down-to-Earth compared to the odd characters around her, in particular her weird best friend Stick and ditzy sister Jeri. In many strips, Teena <b>narrowed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and placed increasing emphasis on her sarcasm, only to have her meaning lost on the other party. Teena's identity as the apparently sole sane person in an insane world was underlined by her red hair, a distinctive physical trait that set her apart from the others. Promotional materials from Universal Press Syndicate position the strip for its appeal to the preteen market, explaining in part the portrayal of a pre-adolescent as the most sensible character.|$|E
50|$|On Demetrius Starbuck {{enters the}} bridge and issues an order to Helo {{to prepare for a}} jump to the {{coordinates}} of the Basestar. All eyes fall on Helo as he swallows hard and tells Starbuck he cannot put the crew at risk. Starbuck relieves him and appoints Mr. Gaeta as the new XO, but he also refuses to follow <b>her</b> command. Starbuck <b>narrows</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> as Helo asserts his authority to relieve her of command.|$|R

50|$|Her {{exhibition}} at the Museum of Modern Art in 2012 also presented a photographic mural (2010-11) that represents the artist's first foray into transforming space through site-specific fictive environments. In the mural, Sherman transforms her face digitally, exaggerating her features through Photoshop by elongating <b>her</b> nose, <b>narrowing</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> or creating smaller lips. Based on a 32-page insert Sherman did for POP using vintage clothes from Chanel’s archive, a more recent series of large-scale pictures from 2012 depict outsized enigmatic female figures standing in striking isolation before ominous painterly landscapes the artist had photographed in Iceland during the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull and on the isle of Capri.|$|R
5000|$|Pizzaz Miller (Elizabeth Banks): Police chief, and Dazzle's irascible supervisor. Though she is {{sometimes}} {{at odds with}} Dazzle due to his shoddy police work and defiance of authority, she fails to harshly discipline him {{for even the most}} severe infractions due to an intense mutual attraction and affection between the two. It is later learned that Pizzaz is an heiress (and eventual sole inheritor) to Moonbeam City's founder, laser prospecting mega-millionaire, Vector Azimuth Miller. Pizzaz also has four abusive and conniving sisters: Charisma, Panache, Sophistica, and Accoutrement. She speaks with a slightly noticeable Southern accent. When either passionate or angry, Pizzaz <b>narrows</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and a slanted window blind-like shadow appears over her face and body, regardless of the location and ambient lighting.|$|R
5000|$|She was {{described}} as [...] "small of stature, frail but erect", <b>her</b> face was <b>narrow,</b> <b>her</b> light-coloured <b>eyes,</b> cold and unmoving, and her lips thin. She was highly intelligent, but austere and self-righteous. Her speech was sharply sarcastic and vehement. Agrippa d' Aubigné, the Huguenot chronicler, described Jeanne as having [...] "a mind powerful enough to guide the highest affairs".|$|R

60|$|Dominey {{looked at}} her calmly. Some sort of evil seemed to have lit in her face. Her lips had shrunk apart, showing her yellow teeth. The fire in <b>her</b> <b>narrowed</b> <b>eyes</b> was the fire of hatred.|$|R
60|$|We stood {{very close}} together, <b>her</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>eyes</b> were as enigmatic as ever, but that face, which, like some ideal {{conception}} of art, {{was incapable of}} anything like untruth and grimace, expressed by some mysterious means such a depth of infinite patience that I felt profoundly ashamed of myself.|$|R
60|$|Hermione {{looked at}} him along <b>her</b> <b>narrow,</b> pallid cheeks. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> were strange and drugged, heavy under their heavy, {{drooping}} lids. Her thin bosom shrugged convulsively. He stared back at her, devilish and unchanging. With another strange, sick convulsion, she turned away, {{as if she were}} sick, could feel dissolution setting-in in her body. For with her mind she was unable to attend to his words, he caught her, as it were, beneath all her defences, and destroyed her with some insidious occult potency.|$|R
60|$|When {{she lay in}} bed, {{she stared}} at the light of the street-lamp on the wall. She was {{thinking}} busily: but heaven knows what she was thinking. She had sharpened the edge of her temper. She was waiting till tomorrow. She was waiting till she saw Albert Witham. She wanted to finish off with him. She was keen to cut clean through any correspondence with him. She stared for many hours at the light of the street-lamp, and there was a <b>narrowed</b> look in <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
500|$|Filmmakers, {{crew members}} and co-stars {{tend to agree}} that Pfeiffer is {{extremely}} [...] "committed" [...] to her work, developing a [...] "reputation for competence, control, and hyper-preparation". At times Pfeiffer {{has been described as}} difficult to work with, particularly by Robert Towne, who directed her in Tequila Sunrise; Towne famously dubbed Pfeiffer [...] "the most difficult actress in Hollywood". On this designation, Pfeiffer admitted that she can seem difficult at times but it mostly [...] "depends on whom you talk to." [...] Famous for being very [...] "press-shy" [...] and private, much like the characters she portrays on-screen, Pfeiffer is notorious for disliking interviews. In a 2017 interview with Interview magazine, the actress warned her interviewer, director Darren Aronofsky, that she is [...] "the worst interviewee that ever was"; her interviews often feature discussions about how much she dislikes being interviewed because the process makes her nervous. Pfeiffer revealed that {{there was a time when}} attending interviews to promote her films would make her very agitated and uncomfortable, but she has always [...] "mastered the art" [...] of maintaining a composed, polite demeanor when performing such responsibilities. However, she maintains that [...] "I still don't believe – and I never will – that it's the actors' responsibility to sell a film." [...] The actress resembles an [...] "intense conversationalist" [...] in her interviews, tending to scrunch <b>her</b> face and <b>narrow</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> before responding to questions. Pfeiffer always discards old scripts in which she has written extensive notes about her characters, nor does she retain film reviews, magazine clippings or covers about her work or performances.|$|R

She has a square jaw and <b>narrowed</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>Her</b> straight hair is parted {{in the middle and}} drawn back behind her ears. She is wearing a scarf crossed at her neck and held with a cameo(?) brooch. She is turned slightly to her left. In an oval cutout...|$|R
60|$|Walking {{backwards}} as nimbly as a cat, {{his head}} drooped, {{his hands in}} front of him, Li Wen left his master's presence. A moment later he reappeared, ushering in La Belle Nita. Prince Shan waved him away. The girl came slowly forward, pale and trembling, smouldering fires in <b>her</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>eyes.</b> Not a muscle of Prince Shan's face moved. He watched her approach in silence. She sank on to the floor by the side of his chair.|$|R
60|$|It was {{impossible}} {{to give her a}} sense of proportion. I suppose she figured England to herself as {{about the size of the}} Pearl of the Ocean; in which case it would certainly have been reeking with gore and a mere wreck of burgled houses from end to end. One could not make her understand that these horrors on which she fed her imagination were lost in the mass of orderly life like a few drops of blood in the ocean. She directed upon me for a moment the uncomprehending glance of <b>her</b> <b>narrowed</b> <b>eyes</b> and then would turn her scornful powdered face away without a word. She would not even take the trouble to shrug her shoulders.|$|R
50|$|One of {{his most}} famous works, Madonna and Child, is {{currently}} {{on display at the}} Metropolitan Museum of Art. It exemplifies several key elements that typify it as quintessentially Byzantine, but it also contains later Italian elements. One can begin with the most recognizable attributes, for example, the halos, the flat and uncrowded gold background, and the blue and red robes of the Virgin and her long features. The golden background and halos surrounding the heads of the Virgin and Child are common in Byzantine representation of divine or holy figures, as are the colors used throughout the composition. These golden halos differ between the two figures in the painting—Christ's is articulated by an inlaid cruciform to distinguish his divine status. The Madonna boasts timeless stylized features of the Virgin. Her fingers, nose, and neck are exaggeratedly long and slender and her face itself is elongated and <b>narrow.</b> <b>Her</b> soulful <b>eyes</b> are large and intensely focused, lending her visage a particular elegance. Upon seeing the painting in person, one can observe a red tint in the cheeks of both Jesus and Mary that gives the flesh a life-like quality - more vivacious, in fact, than its Byzantine predecessors. The particular depth created by the shading of the faces, Mary's in particular - an attribute of early Italian painting - also gives it an air of naturalism that Byzantine figures often lacked.|$|R
6000|$|But not {{so quickly}} nor {{directly}} {{that she did}} not once or twice pause in her flight to examine the new-comer from behind a friendly trunk. He was a stranger--a young fellow with a brown mustache, wearing heavy Mexican spurs in his riding-boots, whose tinkling he apparently did not care to conceal. He had perceived her, and was evidently pursuing her, but so awkwardly and timidly that she eluded him with ease. When she had reached the security of the hollow tree and had pulled the curtain of bark before the <b>narrow</b> opening, with <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> to the interstices, she waited his coming. He arrived breathlessly in the open space before the tree where the bear once lay; the dazed, bewildered, and half awed expression of his face, as he glanced around him and through the openings of the forest aisles, brought a faint smile to her saddened face. At last he called in a half embarrassed voice: ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Morony was an Irishwoman who, as {{she assured}} the magistrates in Worship Street, {{had lived in}} the very highest circles in Limerick, and had come from a princely stock in the {{neighbouring}} county of Glare. She was a full-sized lady, not without a certain amount of good looks, though at the period of her intended purchase in Bishopsgate Street, she must have been nearer fifty than forty. Her face was florid, if not red, her arms were thick and powerful, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> were bright, but, as seen by Brown, Jones, and Robinson, not pleasant to the view, and she always carried with her an air of undaunted resolution. When she entered the shop, she was accompanied by a thin, acrid, unmarried female friend, whose feminine charms by no means equalled her own. She might be of about the same age, but she had more of the air and manner of advanced years. Her nose was long, <b>narrow</b> and red; <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> were set very near together; she was tall and skimpy in all her proportions; and her name was Miss Biles. Of the name and station of Mrs. Morony, or of Miss Biles, nothing was of course known when they entered the shop; but with all these circumstances, B., J., and R. were afterwards made acquainted.|$|R
60|$|Annaple replied by {{throwing}} an arm round her and looking into <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> kissing <b>her</b> on each cheek, and then, {{as they reached}} the landing in the summer twilight, waltzing round and round that <b>narrow</b> space with <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|The Countess of Rocksbier sat at {{the head}} of the table alone with Jacob. Fed upon {{champagne}} and spices for at least two centuries (four, if you count the female line), the Countess Lucy looked well fed. A discriminating nose she had for scents, prolonged, as if in quest of them; her underlip protruded a <b>narrow</b> red shelf; <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> were small, with sandy tufts for eyebrows, and her jowl was heavy. Behind her (the window looked on Grosvenor Square) stood Moll Pratt on the pavement, offering violets for sale; and Mrs. Hilda Thomas, lifting her skirts, preparing to cross the road. One was from Walworth; the other from Putney. Both wore black stockings, but Mrs. Thomas was coiled in furs. The comparison was much in Lady Rocksbier's favour. Moll had more humour, but was violent; stupid too. Hilda Thomas was mealy-mouthed, all her silver frames aslant; egg-cups in the drawing-room; and the windows shrouded. Lady Rocksbier, whatever the deficiencies of her profile, had been a great rider to hounds. She used her knife with authority, tore her chicken bones, asking Jacob's pardon, with her own hands.|$|R
60|$|There was a queer and {{instantaneous}} silence. The {{little group}} of maidservants, {{who had been}} exchanging whispered confidences as to their new master's appearance, were suddenly dumb. All eyes were turned in one direction. A woman whose advent had been unperceived, but who had evidently issued {{from one of the}} recesses of the hall, stood suddenly before them all. She was as thin as a lath, dressed in severe black, with grey hair brushed back from her head and not even a white collar at her neck. Her face was long and <b>narrow,</b> <b>her</b> features curiously large, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> filled with anger. She spoke very slowly, but with some trace in her intonation of a north-country dialect.|$|R
60|$|The still Water-midden {{instantly}} stayed {{her singing}} {{and looked up}} at him. Not in the least less fair than the clustering flowers of Tishnar's orchard was her pale startled face. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> were dark as starry night's beneath <b>her</b> <b>narrow</b> brows. She drew her fingers very stealthily across the clear dark water.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him with interest, and he {{returned}} the gaze. She was tall--almost as tall as he was himself--slim, with dark eyes, heavy eyebrows, and complexion burnt brown by exposure to all sorts of weathers. She wore plain tweed clothes, in the cut of which his critical eye quickly detected the village tailor. Yet there was something about her appearance which seemed to remove her definitely from behind the pale of rusticity. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> were long, and a little <b>narrow,</b> <b>her</b> eyelids heavy, her mouth had a discontented turn at the corners, her whole expression was a trifle sullen. He was not in the least prepared for the change in her face when her forehead suddenly relaxed, {{the corners of her mouth}} softened, and her lips parted in a dazzling smile.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{stretched}} {{wide with}} surprise {{as she looked}} at him. But she said nothing. The same strange and wide, perhaps insatiable child-like curiosity was in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> as she watched him. He dressed very quickly. And <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> were wide, and she said no single word.|$|R
6000|$|As there, {{with his}} bushy red beard, he stood, [...] Pricked out to double its size, [...] He squinted so cross, 'twas {{as much as}} she could [...] To keep the tears out of <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> [...] To keep the tears out of <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Luke Butler is Joss' {{father of}} whom Joss {{inherited}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> She describes <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> as the prettiest features on herself.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{seemed to}} have {{stiffened}} in their sockets, to have become dilated. Her lips trembled, but <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> remained steadfast.|$|R
60|$|When he {{had last}} seen Muriel Gascoyne he had {{considered}} her a comely English girl without imagination or sensibility. She had, in fact, appeared to him <b>narrow</b> in <b>her</b> views, totally unemotional, {{and more than a}} little dull, certainly not the kind of young woman to inspire or reciprocate passionate admiration in any discerning man. Now, as she came towards him with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> shining and the soft colour in her face, which was very gentle, she seemed transfigured and almost radiant. She stooped and kissed Jacinta impulsively.|$|R
