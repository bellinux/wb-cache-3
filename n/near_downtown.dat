5|$|NY240 {{was first}} {{designated}} in the renumbering of state highways in New York in 1930 from NY39 in Springville to NY18 <b>near</b> <b>downtown</b> Buffalo. The portion between Springville and Ashford was {{a section of}} NY62 and Harlem Road was unnumbered. The section south of CR16 in West Valley was a portion of NY242. NY240 instead used Abbott Road and South Park Avenue to get to Buffalo, which got extended to NY5 in the 1930s. NY240 was realigned south to Ellicottville in the mid-1960s, after numerous bypasses and realignments had been done by the State of New York Department of Public Works. NY240 was realigned onto Harlem Road c. 1962. The former alignment to Buffalo is now designated as NY950M, a reference route.|$|E
5|$|State Route 47 (SR 47) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California, {{connecting}} Terminal Island to the mainland in the Los Angeles area. From its south end at I-110 in San Pedro, it heads east across the Vincent Thomas Bridge to the island {{and the end of}} state maintenance. The state highway begins again at the junction with I-710 on Terminal Island, crossing the Schuyler Heim Bridge north to the mainland and the second terminus, where SR 103 begins. Signage continues along a locally maintained route, mainly Alameda Street, to the Gardena Freeway (SR 91) in Compton, and an unconstructed alignment follows the same corridor to the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) <b>near</b> <b>downtown</b> Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, 1955, the Bureau of Public Roads {{approved}} the Interstate Highway System spurs and connections in urban areas. Among these was a loop around the San Francisco Bay, soon numbered I-280 and I-680. The east half (I-680) incorporated {{a number of}} existing legislative routes, including Routes 69, 108, 107, 75, and 74, crossing the Carquinez Strait on the proposed Benicia-Martinez Bridge and ending at I-80 <b>near</b> <b>downtown</b> Vallejo. The first piece of this freeway north of the Carquinez Strait was at the I-80 cloverleaf interchange, built in the late 1950s when I-80 was upgraded through Vallejo. This was an extremely short roadway, beginning at Lemon Street, crossing under I-80 and Laurel Street, and ending at Reis Avenue and Cedar Street. In about 1960, it was extended east to the old highway (Columbus Parkway) between the cities, and was completed to the new bridge in about 1962, the year the bridge opened.|$|E

5|$|SR57 {{begins at}} the Orange Crush {{interchange}} <b>near</b> <b>downtown</b> Orange, where it meets the northwest–southeast Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) and the east–west Garden Grove Freeway (SR22). The Orange Crush interchange, which had long been considered a major bottleneck, was rebuilt in the 1990s and 2000s. The freeway heads north from the junction and soon crosses to {{the west side of}} the Santa Ana River, continuing north through suburban portions of Anaheim and passing next to Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center, Angel Stadium and Honda Center. In northern Anaheim, SR57 meets the Riverside Freeway (SR 91). SR57 briefly passes through Placentia and Fullerton, providing access to California State University, Fullerton. As it crosses Imperial Highway (SR 90) near the Brea Mall and enters Brea, SR57 enters more rugged terrain before climbing through Brea Canyon, the gap between the Chino Hills and Puente Hills. Near the rim of the canyon, the highway curves north out of the Brea Canyon, and descends slightly to a junction with the Pomona Freeway (SR 60) in Diamond Bar, right on the edge of the San Gabriel Valley.|$|E
5|$|Several {{performing}} arts groups and facilities {{are on the}} University of Michigan's campus, as are museums dedicated to art, archaeology, and natural history and sciences. Founded in 1879, the University Musical Society is an independent {{performing arts}} organization that presents over 60 events each year, bringing international artists in music, dance, and theater. Since 2001 Shakespeare in the Arb has presented one play by Shakespeare each June, in a large park <b>near</b> <b>downtown.</b> Regional and local performing arts groups not associated with the university include the Ann Arbor Civic Theatre, the Arbor Opera Theater, the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra, the Ann Arbor Ballet Theater, the Ann Arbor Civic Ballet (established in 1954 as Michigan's first chartered ballet company), The Ark, and Performance Network Theatre. Another unique piece of artistic expression in Ann Arbor is the fairy doors. These small portals are examples of installation art {{and can be found}} throughout the downtown area.|$|E
5|$|US2/US41 widens to four lanes along Ludington Street, {{which forms}} the east–west {{axis of the}} Escanaba street grid. <b>Near</b> <b>downtown,</b> the highway meets M‑35, which runs along the city's north–south axis, Lincoln Avenue. The {{trunklines}} merge and run north, bypassing the traditional central business district for a different business corridor. Lincoln Avenue runs north carrying four lanes of traffic past the Upper Peninsula State Fairgrounds, site {{of one of the}} two state fairs for the state of Michigan, the only state to have twin fairs. US2/US41/M‑35 continues north on Lincoln Avenue past the campus of Bay de Noc Community College. The four-lane highway crosses the Escanaba River just upstream from its mouth near the large Mead Paper Mill and shifts to run immediately next to Little Bay de Noc. The section here carried the highest traffic counts along all of US2 in the state: an average of 23,977vehicles used this segment of roadway daily in 2011.|$|E

5|$|East of San Diego, US 80 {{followed}} {{the path of}} El Cajon Boulevard through La Mesa and then onto Main Street <b>near</b> <b>downtown</b> El Cajon before heading towards the Mountain Springs grade. The route was realigned from Arnold Way onto Alpine Boulevard as it passed through Alpine and the Viejas Indian Reservation, before entering the Laguna Mountains and the Cleveland National Forest on the alignment used by I-8. At Laguna Junction, a cafe for travelers existed from 1916 until when the building was taken down to provide land for the interchange with I-8. A section of old US 80 — with the first few miles signed as SR 79 — continues to serve as access to the communities of Descanso, Guatay and Pine Valley; SR 79 intersected US 80 east of Descanso. At the time, the Ellis Wayside Rest provided a rest area for travelers; later, the state recognized it as a historic site. Exiting the national forest, US 80 continued in a southeasterly direction towards Live Oak Springs and Boulevard, intersecting with the eastern terminus of SR 94. US 80 then came close to the Mexican border as it curved around the Jacumba Mountains and into the hot spring town of Jacumba. East of there, US 80 passed by the Desert View Tower.|$|E
5|$|SR410 {{begins as}} a freeway at an {{interchange}} with SR167 <b>near</b> <b>Downtown</b> Sumner. The highway travels southeast across suburban areas, crossing the Stuck River and passing a partial cloverleaf interchange with Linden Drive, also named Traffic Avenue. After a second partial cloverleaf interchange with Thompson Avenue, SR410 goes under a railroad trestle owned by BNSF Railway and used by Amtrak's Cascades rail service, near the northern bank of the Puyallup River. After turning northeast, SR410 encounters the western terminus of SR162 {{by way of a}} diamond interchange. SR162 travels north into Downtown Sumner as Valley Avenue and south over the Puyallup River towards Orting. The freeway section near the interchange was the busiest recorded part of SR410 in 2008 with a daily average of 59,000motorists using the freeway. Continuing northeast, SR410 connects to 166th Avenue and turns southeast as an undivided highway into the community of Bonney Lake. East of Bonney Lake, the roadway heads east, passing two shopping centers before entering Buckley and intersecting SR165. In Buckley, the street travels northeast through Downtown and turns north to cross the White River and enter King County.|$|E
5|$|In late 1940, a southerly bypass of {{downtown}} Battle Creek opened. U.S. Highway12 (US12) was rerouted out {{of downtown}} to follow Columbia Avenue. The former route was redesignated Business US Highway12 (Bus. US12). In 1958 or 1959, {{a section of}} the route of Bus. US12 was split onto a one-way pairing of streets through downtown Battle Creek. On December 7, 1959, the southern I-94/US12 bypass of Battle Creek was dedicated and opened to traffic. The former routing of US12 along Columbia Avenue was turned over to local control and the route of Bus. US12 was extended via Michigan Avenue easterly and M-78 (Capitol Avenue) southerly to connect to the new freeway. Later the next year, this business loop was redesignated BL I-94. When the first segment of I-194 opened in 1961, BL I-94/M-78 was rerouted to follow the freeway. In 1964, the western end of the business loop was realigned to follow Dickman Road west to Fort Custer and south along Skyline Drive to I-94. The next year, as I-194 was completed and M-78 was replaced by an extended M-66, BL I-94 was rerouted through the downtown area. From Dickman Road, BL I-94 followed I-194/M-66 north {{to the end of the}} freeway at Hamblin Avenue and turned along Hamblin to Michigan Avenue via Jay Street. A minor realignment in 1970 shifted the connection between Hamblin and Michigan avenues. The one-way setup through downtown was removed in 1984. M-96 and M-37 were extended in 2000, running concurrently between Skyline Drive and the Helmer Road intersections. M-89 replaced part of M-37 but did not follow the latter's routing to I-994/M-66 <b>near</b> <b>downtown.</b> Then in 2008, BL I-94 was removed from the northern segment of I-194/M-66 freeway and rerouted to follow Dickman Road to Main Street back to Hamblin Avenue.|$|E
