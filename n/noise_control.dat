5|$|The {{planning}} {{system is}} critical to the viability and operation of GA aerodromes. With many cities lacking scheduled air transport services between them, and with GA access to commercial airports becoming increasingly difficult and expensive, a viable network of aerodromes supporting GA air transport operations is regarded as an important national issue. However, there is no unified national planning policy specific to GA aerodromes, and planning decisions relating to these are based on local issues that are not required to consider the national impact. Because aircraft are excluded from <b>noise</b> <b>control</b> legislation, the only recourse for people affected by aircraft noise is through the planning process, and this issue is the principal factor on which the majority of planning decisions relating to GA land use are made. GA is a specialist subject often unfamiliar to Local Planning Authorities, and most planning decisions relating to GA either refuse permission, or grant it with restrictive conditions. Little Gransden is just one example of a GA airfield required to comply with planning restrictions on the number of movements permitted, thereby inhibiting further development. Such restrictions, if poorly conceived, can make GA operations unviable or even unsafe.|$|E

40|$|Data {{collected}} by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) has shown that roof bolting machine (RBM) operators are the second most likely type of underground mining machine operator to be are over exposed to noise, per the MSHA Permissible Exposure Limit. In response to this, the Pittsburgh Research Laboratory of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has initiated a project to develop engineering <b>noise</b> <b>controls</b> for roof bolting machines. Key to this research is {{an evaluation of the}} duty cycle of a typical roof bolting machine operation and this paper presents the results of such an exercise for data collected at two cooperating coalmines. The evaluation entails a time motion study of an operators' shift, logging each activity for time (e. g., tramming the machine, drilling holes, installing the roof bolt, etc.) and the noise levels associated with each task with a Larson Davis Spark 705 + dosimeter. NIOSH post processed the data to determine which tasks the operator devotes the most time to and the noise dosage accumulated during those tasks. These results provide insight into which portion of the operators' duty cycle is the most prominent contributor to noise exposure and thus, where research activities for the development of engineering <b>noise</b> <b>controls</b> should be focused. It was determined that the task of drilling holes is the most significant source of the operators' noise exposure and project research has focused on engineering <b>noise</b> <b>controls</b> to reduce the noise emissions generated during the drilling portion of the machine duty cycle...|$|R

40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has {{investigated}} engineering <b>noise</b> <b>controls</b> to reduce sound levels in cabs on air-rotary drill rigs. A recent investigation revealed that some drillers {{are exposed to}} A-weighted sound levels exceeding 85 dB even though a cab is used. NIOSH studied the in-cab sound levels of one such rig. First, preliminary tests were conducted in a controlled environment using accelerometers and microphones with spectral analysis to identify the dominant noise sources for in-cab sound levels. The results indicate that vibration transmitted from multiple hydraulic pumps to the control panel produces a dominant spike in the sound level spectrum in the 400 Hz 1 / 3 -octave band. Next, field tests were performed in a production environment to evaluate <b>noise</b> <b>controls</b> to reduce in-cab sound levels.
