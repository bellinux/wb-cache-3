40|$|Nervous system {{function}} is {{closely tied to}} its structure, which ensures proper connectivity and neural activity. <b>Neuronal</b> <b>architecture</b> is assembled {{by a series of}} morphogenetic events, including the coordinated migrations of neurons and axons during development. Subsequently, the <b>neuronal</b> <b>architecture</b> established earlier must persist in the face of further growth, maturation of the nervous system, and the mechanical stress of body movements. In this work, we have shed light on the molecular mechanisms governing both the initial assembly of the nervous system and the long-term maintenance of neural circuits. In particular, we identified heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) as regulators of neuronal migrations. Our discovery and analysis of viable mutations in the two subunits of the heparan sulfate co-polymerase reveals the importance of the coordinated and dynamic action of HSPGs in neuronal and axon guidance during development. Furthermore, we uncovered that the HSPG LON- 2 /glypican functions as a modulator of UNC- 6 /netrin signaling through interactions with the UNC- 40 /DCC receptor. During larval and adult life, molecules such as the protein SAX- 7, homologous to mammalian L 1 CAM, function to protect the integrity of nervous system architecture.

This study employed quantitative confocal microcopy to reconstruct dendritic arbors of cerebellar PCs expressing green fluorescent protein and compared arbor morphology between PCs of sulcus and apex in young and old mice.

Reconstructed morphologies reveal that dendritic arbors of sulcus and apex exhibit profound differences. In sulcus, 72 % of the young PC population possesses two primary dendrites, whereas in apex, only 28 % do. Spatial constraints in the young sulcus cause significantly more dendritic arbor overlap than in young apex, a distinction that disappears in adulthood. However, adult sulcus PC arbors develop a greater number of branch crossings. These results suggest developmental neuronal plasticity that enables cerebellar PCs to attain correct functional adult architecture under different spatial constraints...|$|R
40|$|Two {{classes of}} <b>neuronal</b> <b>architectures</b> {{dominate}} {{in the ongoing}} debate {{on the nature of}} computing by nervous systems. The first is a predominantly feedforward architecture, in which local interactions among neurons within each processing stage play a less influential role compared with the drive of the input to that stage. The second class is a recurrent network architecture, in which the local interactions among neighboring neurons dominate the dynamics of neuronal activity so that the input acts only to bias or seed the state of the network. The study of sensorimotor networks, however, serves to highlight a third class of architectures, which is neither feedforward nor locally recurrent and where computations depend on large-scale feedback loops. Findings that have emerged from our laboratories and those of our colleagues suggest that the vibrissa sensorimotor system is involved in such closed-loop computations. In particular, single unit responses from vibrissa sensory and motor areas show generic signatures of phase-sensitive detection and control at the level of thalamocortical and corticocortical loops.

40|$|The {{quest for}} endowing form with {{function}} represents the fundamental motivation behind all neural network modeling. In this thesis, we discuss various functional <b>neuronal</b> <b>architectures</b> and their implementation in silico, both on conventional computer systems and on neuromorpic devices. Necessarily, such casting {{to a particular}} substrate will constrain their form, either by requiring a simplified description of neuronal dynamics and interactions or by imposing physical limitations on important characteristics such as network connectivity or parameter precision. While our main focus lies on the computational properties of the studied models, we augment our discussion with rigorous mathematical formalism. We start by investigating the behavior of point neurons under synaptic bombardment and provide analytical predictions of single-unit and ensemble statistics. These considerations later become useful when moving to the functional network level, where we {{study the effects of}} an imperfect physical substrate on the computational properties of several cortical networks. Finally, we return to the single neuron level to discuss a novel interpretation of spiking activity in the context of probabilistic inference through sampling.

40|$|Neural rhythms or {{oscillations}} are {{ubiquitous in}} neuroimaging data. These spectral responses {{have been linked}} to several cognitive processes; including working memory, attention, perceptual binding and neuronal coordination. In this paper, we show how Bayesian methods can be used to finesse the ill-posed problem of reconstructing—and explaining—oscillatory responses. We offer an overview of recent developments in this field, focusing on (i) the use of MEG data and Empirical Bayes to build hierarchical models for group analyses—and the identification of important sources of inter-subject variability and (ii) the construction of novel dynamic causal models of intralaminar recordings to explain layer-specific activity. We hope to show that electrophysiological measurements contain much more spatial information than is often thought: on the one hand, the dynamic causal modelling of non-invasive (low spatial resolution) electrophysiology can afford sub-millimetre (hyper-acute) resolution that is limited only by the (spatial) complexity of the underlying (dynamic causal) forward model. On the other hand, invasive microelectrode recordings (that penetrate different cortical layers) can reveal laminar-specific responses and elucidate hierarchical message passing and information processing within and between cortical regions at a macroscopic scale.

40|$|Regardless {{of major}} {{anatomical}} and neurodevelopmental differences, the vertebrate isocortex shows a remarkably well-conserved organization. In the isocortex, reciprocal connections between excitatory and inhibitory neurons are distributed across multiple layers, encompassing modular, dynamical and recurrent functional networks during information processing. These dynamical brain networks are often organized in neuronal assemblies interacting through rhythmic phase relationships. Accordingly, these oscillatory interactions are observed across multiple brain scale levels, {{and they are}} associated with several sensory, motor and cognitive processes. Most notably, oscillatory interactions are {{also found in the}} complete spectrum of vertebrates. Yet, it is unknown why this functional organization is so well conserved in evolution. In this perspective, we propose some ideas about how functional requirements of the isocortex can account for the evolutionary stability observed in microcircuits across vertebrates. We argue that isocortex architectures represent canonical microcircuits resulting from: i) the early selection of <b>neuronal</b> <b>architectures</b> based on the oscillatory excitatory-inhibitory balance, which lead to the implementation of compartmentalized oscillations and ii) the subsequent emergence of inferential coding strategies (predictive coding), which are able to expand computational capacities. We also argue that these functional constraints {{may be the result of}} several advantages that oscillatory activity contributes to brain network processes, such as information transmission and code reliability. In this manner, similarities in mesoscale brain circuitry and input-output organization between different vertebrate groups may reflect evolutionary constraints imposed by these functional requirements, which may or may not be traceable to a common ancestor...|$|R
