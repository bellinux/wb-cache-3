40|$|Background: Calcipotriene and {{betamethasone}} dipropionate are topical treatments for psoriasis vulgaris. Their {{mode of action}} is different. Improved risk/benefit may result with concomitant use of the two compounds together. A <b>new</b> <b>vehicle</b> has been created {{with the objective of}} obtaining optimal stability of both calcipotriene and {{betamethasone dipropionate}} in the combination product. Objective. We compared the clinical efficacy of a fixed combination of calcipotriene and betamethasone clipropionate in a <b>new</b> <b>vehicle</b> to calcipotriene in the <b>new</b> <b>vehicle,</b> betamethasone in the <b>new</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and the <b>new</b> <b>vehicle</b> alone. Methods: This was an international, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 4 -week study in patients with psoriasis vulgaris amenable to topical treatment. Results. The mean percentage reduction in PASI from baseline to end of treatment was 73. 2 % in the combination group (n = 301), 48. 8 % in the calcipotriene group (n = 308), 63. 1 % in the betamethasone dipropionate group (n = 312) and 28. 8 % in the <b>new</b> <b>vehicle</b> group (n = 107), (P <. 001). The mean percentage reduction in PASI during the first week was 48. 1 %, 28. 4 %, 41. 4 %, and 21. 5 %, respectively (P <. 001). Conclusion: A combination product of calcipotriene 50 mug/g and betamethasone dipropionate 0. 5 mg/g in the <b>new</b> <b>vehicle</b> shows superior efficacy with a more rapid onset of action than the <b>new</b> <b>vehicle</b> containing either constituent alone in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris...|$|R

Neutral countries such as Sweden and Switzerland were willing to sell vehicles to Finland but demanded payment in advance and in their own currencies.

The game also includes a limited map-editing tool, known as the Forge, which allows players to insert game objects, such as weapons and crates, into existing multiplayer map geometry. Players can also save a recording of their gameplay sessions, and view them as video, from any angle.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 {{the line}} to Upminster was {{electrified}} and <b>new</b> <b>vehicles</b> were purchased. After the District Railway became part of London Underground, similar cars were ordered to allow the Metropolitan line be extended to Barking and replace some of the rapidly deteriorating original wooden trailers. The 1935–40 New Works Programme fitted electro-pneumatic brakes and air-operated doors {{to most of the}} District line stock and allowed the remaining wooden cars to be scrapped. A number of motor cars were not suitable for conversion and so some trains retained their hand-worked doors and these ran until 1957.|$|E

5|$|The {{changes were}} met with {{critical}} reception in the province. Many students are now required to pay higher sports fees to cover higher transportation costs. Some schools {{do not have access}} to approved vehicles because the Education Act prohibits schools and school districts from owning vehicles. To get around this they use corporate entities to operate vehicles for extracurricular activities. These require money to buy <b>new</b> <b>vehicles</b> and the required insurance, which often requires schools to conduct extra fundraising.|$|E
5|$|A {{specialist}} {{was hired}} to enhance the game's artificial intelligence and give enemies more lifelike behaviour. In previous Tomb Raider games, enemies would simply run at Lara and attack immediately, whereas in Tomb Raider III, enemies can pop {{out of the dark}} and attack the player, or retreat back into the level and regroup to attack later. A stealth element partially inspired by Rare's 1997 hit GoldenEye 007 was also introduced, giving players the option of sneaking around and avoid detection. <b>New</b> <b>vehicles</b> that are critical to complete certain levels were added; the team also experimented with the idea of putting Lara on horseback, but they ultimately discarded it. The development of the game took eleven months to complete, and incorporating all the new ideas into the engine was considered the most difficult task of the project.|$|E
5|$|Biofuel cars {{in general}} get strong tax {{incentives}} in France, including a 0 or 50% reduction {{on the tax}} on <b>new</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and a 40% reduction on CO2 tax for new cars. For company cars there is a corporate car tax free for 2 years and a recovery of 80% of the value added tax (VAT) on E85 vehicles. Also, E85 fuel price is set significantly lower than diesel or gasoline, resulting in E85 at € 0.80, diesel at €1.15, and gasoline at €1.30 per liter, as of April 2007. By May 2008, France had 211 pumps selling E85, even though the government made plans for the installation of up to 500 E85 pumps by year end 2007. French automakers Renault and PSA (Citroen & Peugeot) announced they will start selling FFV cars beginning in the summer 2007.|$|E

30|$|Because of the {{openness}} of VANETs, the network needs to face many security risks. If a <b>new</b> <b>vehicle</b> node wants to access the VANET, we need to validate the <b>new</b> <b>vehicle</b> node to improve {{the security of the}} VANET. We propose a security authentication method based on trust evaluation. Firstly, when a vehicle wants to access the Internet through the roadside base station, we evaluate the access node by employing the direct trust evaluation. Based on the historical security event record, the direct security degree of the <b>new</b> <b>vehicle</b> node is determined. When a group of vehicles form a wireless network to communicate information with each other, we adopt the indirect trust evaluation mechanism to evaluate the <b>new</b> <b>vehicle</b> node. All vehicle nodes in the network can determine whether to accept the <b>new</b> <b>vehicle</b> node. Each node sends a vector to show its recommendation trust value. Based on the correlation coefficient, we distinguish the malicious vehicle nodes and remove all recommendation trust value from the malicious vehicle nodes. Then, the indirect trust value is calculated by averaging all the remaining recommendation trust values. Simulation results show our method can accurately validate the vehicle node.|$|R

5|$|Creative Assembly's studio director, Tim Heaton, {{explained}} that Halo Wars 2 would not feature gameplay {{similar to their}} Total War series. Instead they wanted to build upon the foundation established with Halo Wars. With Halo Wars 2, the development team hoped to introduce new players to the strategy game genre while appeasing experienced players by including a range of multiplayer modes that {{a wide spectrum of}} players could enjoy. They also wanted to extend the purpose of leader units and their abilities by giving each of them a more defining role in the style of play they represent. Creative Assembly thought that the game needed more units capable of performing long range attacks. They wanted to add more artillery pieces, however they found that there were currently no suitable vehicles in the Halo universe. To remedy this, they created two <b>new</b> <b>vehicles,</b> the Kodiak and the Blisterback, to fit the role. They used reference material supplied by 343 Industries to ensure the <b>new</b> <b>vehicles</b> did not feel out of place. Halo Wars 2s creative director, Alistair Hope, noted that staying true to the source material was important aspect for all of Creative Assembly's games, but stated that the team were given more freedom to explore and expand the Halo universe than they had anticipated. Hope praised the control scheme used in Halo Wars and aimed to enhance the system by ensuring that Halo Wars 2 would be intuitive to play on a console. One common control feature included in many PC RTS games but absent from the original Halo Wars is control groups, which enables sets of units to be manually assigned to a key. As Halo Wars 2 was developed for console and PC, the designers were keen to include the feature for both versions of the game. 343 Industries had initially considered supporting cross-platform play between Windows and Xbox One devices, but the feature was ultimately excluded from the game at launch.|$|E
5|$|Further {{expansion}} came in April 1985, following {{over a year}} {{of consultation}} with county council members, regulators, when two new routes were introduced. One operated in competition with Alder Valley, while the other took the place of services withdrawn by other operators. Following these changes Tillingbourne became the only operator to serve Chilworth, Albury and Shere. Two <b>new</b> <b>vehicles</b> were purchased for the routes. At the same time, all of Tillingbourne's services were renumbered into a new two-digit sequence, to avoid confusion with London Country routes. A year later, {{the second of the}} new services, circular route 23/25, was reduced in frequency from hourly to two-hourly, although much of the route was covered by extending another route. Another new service, linking Cranleigh and Godalming, was also introduced. In August 1986, operation of a number of council-contracted services, including a route from Redhill to Reigate and a local route in Horsham, were taken over from other companies.|$|E
5|$|Jungle Strike was {{followed}} by three further sequels: Urban Strike, Soviet Strike, and Nuclear Strike.

Soviet Strike, released for Sony's PlayStation and the Sega Saturn in 1996, featured 3D graphics, as did Nuclear Strike, released on PC and PlayStation in 1997 and the Nintendo 64 in 1999. Another sequel provisionally titled Future Strike was planned, but the game was eventually released as , a mech-based shooter game.|$|E
