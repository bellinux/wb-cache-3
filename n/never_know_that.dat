2500|$|On publication, New York Times {{reviewer}} Fred T. March {{compared it}} to the [...] "genial gusto" [...] of the [...] "picaresque" [...] Tortilla Flat. He commented that [...] "You would <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> In Dubious Battle was by the same John Steinbeck if the publishers did not tell you so." [...] He called it [...] "courageous and desperately honest," [...] "the best labor and strike novel {{to come out of}} our contemporary economic and social unrest," [...] and [...] "such a novel as Sinclair Lewis at his best might have done had he gone on with his projected labor novel..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also {{as cited}} as {{harassment}} of Bailey were legal complaints that Bailey was practicing psychology without a license. The basis for these complaints was that sex-reassignment {{surgery in the}} US requires authorization letters from two psychologists, and Bailey had written a second letter, at no charge and upon request, for some individuals Bailey had spoken with while writing the book. American bioethicist Alice Dreger notes {{that there was no}} legal basis for this claim, as Bailey received no compensation for his services, and was forthright in this letters about his qualifications, even attaching copies of his C.V: [...] "Presumably all this was why [...] never bothered to pursue the charge, although you’d <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> from reading the press accounts, which mentioned only the complaints, not that they had petered out." [...] State regulators took no action on these complaints.|$|E
2500|$|Kenneth Turan of NPR {{criticized the}} film, arguing: [...] "It's been 50 years since Hollywood first started flirting with 3-D movies, {{and the special}} glasses {{required}} for viewing have gotten {{a whole lot more}} substantial. The stories being filmed are just as flimsy. Of course Beowulf does have a more impressive literary pedigree than, say, Bwana Devil. But you'd <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> by looking at the movie. Beowulf's story of a hero who slays monsters has become a fanboy fantasy that panders with demonic energy to the young male demographic." [...] Manohla Dargis of the New York Times compared the poem with the film stating that, [...] "If you don't remember this evil babe from the poem, it's because she's almost entirely the invention of the screenwriters Roger Avary and Neil Gaiman and the director Robert Zemeckis, who together have plumped her up in words, deeds and curves. These creative interventions aren't especially surprising given the source material and the nature of big-studio adaptations. There's plenty of action in Beowulf, but even its more vigorous bloodletting pales next to its rich language, exotic setting and mythic grandeur." ...|$|E

60|$|The Blind Girl <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{ceilings}} were discoloured, walls blotched {{and bare}} of plaster here and there, high crevices unstopped and widening every day, beams mouldering and tending downward. The Blind Girl <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> iron was rusting, wood rotting, paper peeling off; the size, and shape, and true {{proportion of the}} dwelling, withering away. The Blind Girl <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> ugly shapes of delf and earthenware were on the board; that sorrow and faint-heartedness were in the house; that Caleb's scanty hairs were turning greyer and more grey before her sightless face. The Blind Girl <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> they had a master, cold, exacting, and uninterested--never <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Tackleton was Tackleton, in short; but lived in the belief of an eccentric humorist, who loved to have his jest with them, and who, while he was the Guardian Angel of their lives, disdained to hear one word of thankfulness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cannibals!" [...] {{interrupted}} Mrs. Eversley, [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{they were}} cannibals. Indeed, I {{know little about}} the Pongo, whom I scarcely ever see." ...|$|R

60|$|She will <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> a nameless, penniless {{soldier of}} fortune has loved her with every beat of his heart, every {{thought of his}} brain, with every sinew and every aspiration. She will <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> just {{in order to remain}} near her, when she was dragged away out of Rotterdam he affronted {{deliberately}} the trap into which he fell. She will <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> for her dear sake, he has borne humiliation against which every nerve of his splendid nature did inwardly rebel, owning to guilt and shame lest her blue eyes shed tears for a brother's sin. She will <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the warning to the Stadtholder came from him, and that he was neither a forger nor a thief, only just a soldier of fortune with a contempt for death, and an unspoken adoration for the one woman who seemed to him as distant from him as the stars.|$|E
