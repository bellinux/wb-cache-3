2500|$|President Barack Obama {{called for}} “common sense” gun safety laws and {{stronger}} background checks {{as part of}} a bipartisan effort to reduce the frequency of such shootings. In an interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell, Obama said, [...] "We have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world." [...] Obama called for legislation to block people on the anti-terrorism <b>No</b> <b>Fly</b> <b>List</b> from purchasing weapons.

[...] Members of the California State Legislature also proposed to revisit some gun-control proposals that had previously stalled, with one assemblyman proposing a prohibition of the sale of guns to those on the federal <b>No</b> <b>Fly</b> <b>List.</b> On January 8, 2016, Representative Pete Aguilar of Redlands spoke on the floor of the House of Representatives and called for gun control.

2500|$|On July 23, 2006 the United States Department of the Treasury {{designated}} Abdelrazik as {{a supporter}} of al-Qaeda and a terrorist, [...] "for his high-level ties to and support for al-Qaeda." [...] According to the Globe and Mail, the U.S. State Department believes, [...] "Mr. Abdelrazik was “closely associated with Abu Zubaydah, Osama bin Laden's lieutenant responsible for recruiting and for al-Qaeda's network of training camps in Afghanistan.” The United States also alleges Mr. Abdelrazik recruited and accompanied a Tunisian extremist named Raouf Hannachi for paramilitary training at a camp in Afghanistan in 1996 “where al-Qaeda and other UN-sanctioned terrorist groups were known to train,” and became personally acquainted with Mr. bin Laden". [...] In April 2011, Wikileaks revealed that a November 2008 U.S. Department of Defence document stated that Abdelrazik had admitted receiving $10 000 from alleged al-Qaeda financier Hassan Zemiri, who was captured in late 2001 in Tora Bora, Afghanistan. [...] However, none of these allegations have been proven {{in a court of}} law and Abdelrazik has never been charged with any crime, in Canada or anywhere else in the world. Eight days after he was designated a terrorist by the US, he was added to the UN Security Council terrorist blacklist (not a <b>no</b> <b>fly</b> <b>list)</b> by the U.S. and is now the only living Canadian on that list. According to the Globe and mail,"any country can nominate anyone they consider to be an islamic extremist. All his personal assets were frozen once he was put on that list. Individuals on the list are subject to a sanctions regime which include an asset freeze and a ban on international travel (but not flight per se). According to a letter sent on April 18, 2008, by the Department of Foreign Affairs to Abousfian Abdelrazik's lawyer, the Canadian government requested the UN's 1267 Committee to remove Abdelrazik from its list of al Qaeda supporters.|$|E

5000|$|Abe Mashal, a 31-year-old Muslim and United States Marine Veteran, {{found himself}} on the <b>No</b> <b>Fly</b> <b>List</b> in April 2010 while {{attempting}} to board a plane out of Midway Airport. He was questioned by the TSA, FBI and Chicago Police {{at the airport and}} was told they had no clue why he was on the <b>No</b> <b>Fly</b> <b>List.</b> Once he arrived at home that day two other FBI agents came to his home and used a Do Not Fly question-and-answer sheet to question him. They informed him they had no idea why he was on the <b>No</b> <b>Fly</b> <b>List.</b> In June 2010 those same two FBI agents summoned Mashal to a local hotel and invited him to a private room. They told him that he was in no trouble and the reason he ended up on the <b>No</b> <b>Fly</b> <b>List</b> was because of possibly sending emails to an American imam they may have been monitoring. They then informed him that if he would go undercover at various local mosques, they could get him off the <b>No</b> <b>Fly</b> <b>List</b> immediately and he would be compensated for such actions. Mashal refused to answer any additional questions without a lawyer present and was told to leave the hotel. Mashal then contacted the ACLU and is now being represented in a class-action lawsuit filed against the TSA, FBI and DHS concerning the legality of the <b>No</b> <b>Fly</b> <b>List</b> and how people end up on it. Mashal feels as if he was blackmailed into becoming an informant by being placed on the <b>No</b> <b>Fly</b> <b>List.</b> Mashal has since appeared on ABC, NBC, PBS and Al Jazeera concerning his inclusion on the <b>No</b> <b>Fly</b> <b>List.</b> He has also written a book about his experience titled [...] "No Spy No Fly." ...|$|E
