5|$|Commercially viable natural {{deposits}} of graphite occur {{in many parts}} of the world, but the most important sources economically are in China, India, Brazil and North Korea. Graphite deposits are of metamorphic origin, found in association with quartz, mica and feldspars in schists, gneisses and metamorphosed sandstones and limestone as lenses or veins, sometimes of a metre or more in thickness. Deposits of graphite in Borrowdale, Cumberland, England were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century, pencils were made simply by sawing blocks of <b>natural</b> <b>graphite</b> into strips before encasing the strips in wood.

Varying quantities (1. 5 - 30 pct) of <b>natural</b> flake <b>graphite</b> and carbon fibers were added to test samples. The effect of the additions on modulus of rupture (75 deg- 2, 750 deg f), deformation under load (2, 750 deg f), and air-slag-metal resistance (3, 000 deg f) was studied. Carbon purity of <b>natural</b> flake <b>graphite</b> additions did not influence hot strength, deformation under load, or air-slag-metal resistance. When the quantity of 90 -pct-carbon graphite addition varied between 0 and 30 wt pct, hot strength was highest, deformation under load lowest, and air-slag-metal wear the least at 10 wt pct. As test temperature increased from 500 deg to 2, 750 deg f, the hot strength difference became less. Carbon fiber additions were limited to 1. 5 pct in dolomite-carbon brick. At this level, physical properties were generally comparable to those obtained with <b>natural</b> flake <b>graphite,</b> but were below values obtained with 10 -pct- flake-graphite additions.

40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{investigated}} {{the role of}} imported <b>natural</b> flake <b>graphite</b> in dolomite-carbon refractories used in steelmaking processes. Fundamental engineering data were obtained to enable the evaluation of substitute materials. Changes in oxidation resistance (2, 000 deg f), hot strength (2, 750 deg f), and deformation under load (2, 750 deg f) caused by 10 -wt-pct additions of five different kinds of <b>natural</b> flake <b>graphite</b> and increasing quantities (0 to 30 pct) of a 90 -pct-carbon <b>natural</b> flake <b>graphite</b> were studied. Results indicated that carbon purity of 10 -wt-pct-graphite additions did not influence hot strength deformation under load. When the quantity of 90 -pct-carbon graphite addition varied between 0 and 30 wt pct in a dolomite-carbon brick, hot strength was highest and deformation under load lowest with 10 -wt-pct additions. As hot strength test temperature was increased from 500 deg to 2, 750 deg f, the strength difference observed between 0 - and 30 -wt-pct additions of a 90 -pct-carbon graphite became smaller. Additions of a boron- treated graphite caused significantly higher strength and lower deformation under load at high temperatures, while an addition of ball clay significantly reduced strength and increased deformation.

500|$|There {{are three}} types of natural graphite—amorphous, flake or {{crystalline}} flake, and vein or lump. Amorphous graphite is the lowest quality and most abundant. Contrary to science, in industry [...] "amorphous" [...] refers to very small crystal size rather than complete lack of crystal structure. Amorphous is used for lower value graphite products and is the lowest priced graphite. Large amorphous graphite deposits are found in China, Europe, Mexico and the United States. Flake graphite is less common and of higher quality than amorphous; it occurs as separate plates that crystallized in metamorphic rock. Flake graphite can be four times the price of amorphous. Good quality flakes can be processed into expandable graphite for many uses, such as flame retardants. The foremost deposits are found in Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany and Madagascar.

40|$|In this paper, a surfactant, atlox 4862 (formaldehyde {{condensate}} of methyl naphthalene sulfonic sodium salt) (MF), {{was introduced}} as a depressant for reverse flotation separation of sericite from <b>graphite.</b> <b>Natural</b> flake <b>graphite</b> {{has a strong}} hydrophobic property.

The flotation results showed that MF had a depressing ability for both sericite and graphite and that the flotation separation of sericite from graphite was attributed to the different declining levels of recovery between graphite and sericite with increased MF concentration. For a pulp pH of 8 and a MF concentration of 250 mg/L, the recovery rates of sericite and graphite were 89. 7 % and 11. 3 %, respectively.
