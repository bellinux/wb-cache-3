In this cell line, phosphodiesterase activity measured at 0. 25 microM-cyclic AMP is approx. 7 -fold greater than that in isolated human peripheral-blood lymphocytes, and 16 % of the phosphodiesterase activity in RPMI 8392 cells is associated with particulate fractions. Phosphodiesterase activity in crude fractions of this cell line is reproducibly stimulated by about 60 - 80 % by Ca 2 +-calmodulin. In the presence of 20 nM-calmodulin, half-maximal stimulation occurs at 0. 7 microM-Ca 2 +. The cytosolic phosphodiesterase activity of RPMI 8392 cells is separated into two forms by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. The first form is eluted at approx. 0. 2 M-sodium acetate, catalyses the hydrolysis of both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP, and is stimulated 3 -fold by Ca 2 +-calmodulin. This form exhibits <b>non-linear</b> <b>kinetics</b> for cyclic AMP {{in the absence of}} calmodulin, with extrapolated Km values of 0. 8 and 4 microM, and <b>non-linear</b> <b>kinetics</b> in the presence of calmodulin, with extrapolated Km values of 0. 5 and 1 microM.

40|$|Low {{apparent}} aldose reductase activity, {{as measured}} by NADPH oxidation, can be produced by the spontaneous autoxidation of monosaccharides. NADPH is oxidized to metabolically active NADP+ in a solution of autoxidizing DL-glyceraldehyde at rates of up to 15 X 10 (- 4) A 340 /min. The close parallelism between the effects of buffer salt type and concentration, monosaccharide structure and temperature activation on autoxidation and NADPH oxidation imply that autoxidation {{is a prerequisite for}} the NADPH oxidation, probably via the hydroperoxy radical. Nucleotide-binding proteins enhanced NADPH oxidation induced by DL-glyceraldehyde, up to 10. 6 -fold with glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase. Glutathione reductase-catalysed NADPH oxidation in the presence of autoxidizing monosaccharide showed many characteristics of the aldose reductase reaction. Aldose reductase inhibitors acted as antioxidants in inhibiting this NADPH oxidation.

40|$|Abstract — Groundwater is like {{dark matter}} – {{we know very}} little apart {{from the fact that}} it is hugely important. Given the {{scarcity}} of data, mathematical modelling can come to the rescue but existing groundwater models are mainly restricted to simulate the transport and degradation of contaminants on the scale of whole contaminated field sites by averaging out the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the availability of the pollutant to the degrading organisms. These coarse-scale mean-field models therefore tend to rely on fitting to data rather than being predictive. Also, they are less suited to incorporate spatial variability and <b>non-linear</b> <b>kinetics</b> and feedbacks. We propose to solve the two mutually exacerbating problems of environmental patchiness and data scarcity by developing a flexible and robust distributed simulation framework that uses an ensemble of small scale simulations running on different processors/computers t...|$|E

None of these models appears to suggest the existence of "thresholds". The analysis of both linear and nonlinear models indicates that if background concentrations are present, then under almost all models discussed, the marginal response associated with the new carcinogen increases more linearly with dose. The results of the study are then examined with respect to dispersal of carcinogenic pollutants as a means of reducing environmental hazards to a given population. It was then concluded that dispersal may not reduce the overall risk if linear or near-linear dose-response relationships are assumed.

In this article, spatially and temporally resolved concentrations of PAH concentrations are presented for 1 – 500 Hz acoustically forced methane/air counter flow flames. Numerical results are compared with experimental measurements obtained in similar conditions.

As such, these conditions reflect the situation found in most practical gasification systems. The model presented is applied under conditions where intraparticle mass transfer is rate-controlling. Intraparticle heat transfer is neglected. In view of the non-equimolar gasification reactions, the mass flux equations are derived from the continuum limit of the dusty gas model. These flux equations are combined with strongly <b>non-linear</b> Langmuir-Hinshelwood <b>kinetics</b> for the gasification reactions. The model accounts for local variations of the diffusive and convective permeability parameters, as well as variations in the reactive surface area, during burnoff of a char particle.

40|$|The electro-oxidation {{of small}} organic {{molecules}} {{is one of}} the major areas of interest in electrocatalysis due to its potential use in energy conversion. Instabilities in alkaline solution, particularly in comparison with kinetic properties in a conventional regime, are rarely reported in the literature, despite the fact that the catalytic activity is higher in this medium and the onset potential is shifted to lower values compared to acidic media. Ethanol oxidation on polycrystalline platinum exhibits oscillations under galvanostatic control. As the reaction is structure-sensitive, it is possible to study the contribution of the three platinum basal planes to the complex kinetics. We found that Pt(100) has the major influence in the overall <b>non-linear</b> <b>kinetics</b> of ethanol electro-oxidation on Pt(poly), possibly because it has the highest formation and accumulation rate of COads. Based on the differences observed in the galvanostatic transients on Pt(poly), Pt(110) and Pt(100), and the absence of this behavior on Pt(111), it is possible to infer that surface sites strongly influence the kinetic scenario during the ethanol oxidation reaction.

Phage-insensitive populations of C. jejuni arise readily, and as far as we are aware this is the first phage therapy study to test, against in vitro data, models for phage–bacteria interactions incorporating phage-insensitive or resistant bacteria. We find that even an apparently simplistic model fits the data surprisingly well, and we confirm that the so-called inundation and proliferation thresholds are likely to be of considerable practical importance to phage therapy. We fit the model to time series data in order to estimate thresholds and rate constants directly. A comparison of the fit for each culture reveals density-dependent features of phage infectivity that are worthy of further investigation.

The kinetic mechanism of the enzyme was investigated by using product and dead-end inhibitors of the cleavage and condensation reactions. The data indicated an ordered Uni Bi mechanism and the kinetic constants of the model were calculated. The spectrophotometric titration of thiol groups in Phycomyces isocitrate lyase with 5. 5 '-dithiobis-(2 -nitrobenzoic acid) gave two free thiol groups per subunit of enzyme in the native state and three in the denatured state.
