60|$|A {{very large}} foreign-looking case had been partly opened, {{and when she}} looked in she was appalled at the task to be {{accomplished}} in one day. It was crammed with shells of every size and description, from the large helmet-conch and Triton's trumpet, down to the tiny pink cowry and rice-volute, all stuffed together without arrangement or packing, forming a mass in which the unbroken shells reposed {{in a kind of}} sand, of debris ground together out of the victims; and when she took up a tolerably-sized univalve, quantities of little ones came tumbling out of its inner folds. She took up a handful, and presently picked out one perfect valve like a rose petal, three fairy cups of limpets, four ribbed cowries, and a thing like a green pea. Of course she knew no names, but a kind of interest was awakened by the beauty and variety before her. A pile of papers had been provided, and the housewife [a pocket-size container for small articles (as thread)--D.L.] which Betty made her always carry in her pocket furnished wherewithal to make up a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bags</b> for the lesser sorts; and she went to work, her troubles somewhat beguiled by the novel beauties of each delicate creature she disinterred, but remembering with a pang how, if she could have described them to Mr. Belamour, he would have discoursed upon the Order of Nature.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a new and}} general {{preprocessor}} algorithm, called CSRoulette, which converts any cost-insensitive classification algorithms into cost-sensitive ones. CSRoulette is based on cost proportional roulette sampling technique (called CPRS in short). CSRoulette {{is closely related to}} Costing, another cost-sensitive meta-learning algorithm, which is based on rejection sampling. Unlike rejection sampling which produces smaller samples, CPRS can generate different size samples. To further improve its performance, we apply ensemble (bagging) on CPRS; the resulting algorithm is called CSRoulette. Our experiments show that CSRoulette outperforms Costing and other meta-learning methods in most datasets tested. In addition, we investigate the effect of various sample sizes and conclude that reduced sample sizes (as in rejection sampling) cannot be compensated by increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bagging</b> iterations...|$|R
50|$|Most field {{artillery}} situations require indirect fire due to weather, terrain, night-time conditions, distance, or other obstacles. These gunners can also {{rely upon a}} trained artillery observer, also called a forward observer, who sees the target and relays the coordinates of the target to their fire direction center, which in turn translates those coordinates into: a left-right aiming direction; an elevation angle; a calculated <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bags</b> of propellant; and finally a fuze with a determined waiting time before exploding (if necessary) to be set, which is then mated to the artillery projectile now ready to be fired.|$|E
50|$|When Alauddin reached Ranthambore, {{the fort}} was already {{surrounded}} by the Delhi army. He realized that a direct attack on the fort was not feasible: the advantage lay with the defenders. Alauddin's camp was located on a hillock called Ran, which faced the Ranthambore Fort's hill. Alauddin ordered {{the construction of a}} pasheb, an inclined mound built to fill the ditch separating his camp and the fort. Weavers from the neighbouring areas were brought, and asked to sew a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bags.</b> Alauddin's soldiers then filled these bags with soil, and used them to build the pasheb mound.|$|E

He was determined to fortify the nation's infrastructure and created Ecopetrol (Colombian Petroleum Company) and Acerias Paz del Río (the country's largest steel mill). He was also committed to social responsibility and, to that end, set up the financial institution La Caja Agraria, the Social Security Administration, the Department of Labor and the Housing Credit Agency to help meet the credit, educational and social needs of blue-collar workers, coffee growers, and other small farmers and peasants.|$|E
