There are <b>not</b> <b>mandatory</b> fines for smoking transgressions, although the newest 2016 anti-smoking campaign has seen fines issued and offenders threatened with images of them being broadcast on TV. Tobacco packaging warning messages are required on all types of packaging, but their appearance is not regulated in any way. They are usually printed in small print {{on the side of the}} package and only state that smoking is harmful to health. However, the descriptions must state the nicotine and tar content, must not be misleading and do need to be approved by local authorities. Graphic warning images that are now common worldwide have never appeared on packaging.|$|E

When testing toxicity of food additives, food contaminants, and some drugs and chemicals the FDA uses beagles and miniature pigs as surrogates for direct human testing.

5|$|According to the {{statutes}} of the Nobel Foundation, each laureate {{is required to}} give a public lecture on a subject related {{to the topic of}} their prize. The Nobel lecture as a rhetorical genre took decades to reach its current format. These lectures normally occur during Nobel Week (the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet, which begins with the laureates arriving in Stockholm and normally ends with the Nobel banquet), but this is <b>not</b> <b>mandatory.</b> The laureate is only obliged to give the lecture within six months of receiving the prize. Some have happened even later. For example, US President Theodore Roosevelt received the Peace Prize in 1906 but gave his lecture in 1910, after his term in office. The lectures are organised by the same association which selected the laureates.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} it was <b>not</b> <b>mandatory</b> to flight test new {{variants}} of existing engines, and certification testing failed to reveal vibration modes that the fan experienced during the regularly performed power climbs at high altitude. Analysis revealed that the fan was being subjected to high-cycle fatigue stresses worse than expected and also more severe than tested for certification; these higher stresses caused the blade to fracture. Less than a month after grounding, the fleet was allowed to resume operations once the fan blades and fan disc were replaced and the electronic engine controls were modified to reduce maximum engine thrust to 22,000lbf (98kN) from 23,500lbf (105kN). The redesigned fan blades were installed on all CFM56-3C1 and CFM56-3B2 engines, including over 1,800 engines that had already been delivered to customers.|$|E
5|$|Each {{state has}} a unicameral State Legislative Assembly whose members are elected from {{single-member}} constituencies. State governments are led by Chief Ministers, who are state assembly members from the majority party in the assembly. In each of the states with a hereditary ruler, the Chief Minister is normally required to be a Malay, appointed by the ruler upon {{the recommendation of the}} Prime Minister. Parliamentary elections are held at least once every five years, the most recent of which took place in May 2013. Registered voters of age 21 and above may vote for the members of the House of Representatives and, in most of the states, for the state legislative chamber. Voting is <b>not</b> <b>mandatory.</b> Except for state elections in Sarawak, by convention state elections are held concurrently with the federal election.|$|E
5|$|Public schools allow {{religious}} education, {{in cooperation}} with religious communities that have agreements with the government, but attendance is <b>not</b> <b>mandatory.</b> The classes are organized widely in public elementary and secondary schools. In 2009, 92% of elementary school pupils and 87% of secondary school students attended the religious education classes. Public holidays in Croatia also include the religious festivals of Epiphany, Easter Monday, Corpus Christi Day, Assumption Day, All Saints' Day, Christmas, and St. Stephen's or Boxing Day. The religious festival public holidays {{are based on the}} Catholic liturgical year, but citizens of the Republic of Croatia who celebrate different religious holidays have the right not to work on those dates. This includes Christians who celebrate Christmas on 7 January per the Julian calendar, Muslims on the days of Ramadan Bayram and Kurban Bayram, and Jews on the days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Marriages performed by the religious communities having agreements with the state are officially recognized, eliminating the need to register the marriages in a registrar office.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: To prevent work-related ill-health, {{selection}} of workers for mandatory occupational health surveillance {{should be based}} on the actual risk of work-related disease. AIMS: (i) To determine the proportion of sick-listed workers with self-reported work-related health problems <b>not</b> under <b>mandatory</b> occupational health surveillance. (ii) To determine whether self-reported work-related sickness absences occur more frequently among workers under mandatory occupational health surveillance or among workers <b>not</b> under <b>mandatory</b> surveillance. METHODS: Questionnaire-based descriptive study. The setting was the work inability assessment consultation of social insurance physicians in Belgium. Patients' inclusion criteria were employee, age 18 - 50 and 1 - 12 months of sickness absence. Workers with pregnancy-related sicknesses were excluded. We cross-tabulated the questionnaire results, noting (i) the workers' perception of the work relatedness of their sickness absence and (ii) workers' knowledge of the occupational physician, which was assumed to reflect workers who had undergone mandatory occupational health surveillance. RESULTS: There were 1564 participants. Thirty-seven per cent of workers with self-reported work-related sickness absences were <b>not</b> under <b>mandatory</b> occupational health surveillance. Work-related sickness absences occurred as frequently among workers under mandatory occupational surveillance as among those <b>not</b> under <b>mandatory</b> occupational health surveillance (34 and 35 %, respectively; P = 0. 80). CONCLUSION: To prevent work-related illnesses and sickness absences, a revision of the mandatory occupational health surveillance system is indicated. status: publishe...|$|R
