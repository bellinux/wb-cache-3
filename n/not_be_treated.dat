5|$|Dewi Zephaniah Phillips defended Wittgenstein's theory {{by arguing}} that {{although}} religious language games are autonomous, they should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as isolated because they make statements about secular events such as birth and death. Phillips argued that because of this connection, religions can still be criticised based on human experiences of these secular events. He maintained that religion cannot be denounced as wrong {{because it is not}} empirical.|$|E
5|$|In August 1987, at {{the annual}} B.C. Open hosted at a Holiday Inn in Binghamton, New York, Balukas was slated for {{competition}} in both divisions. After arriving, she discovered that for evening-scheduled matches she {{would be required to}} wear formal attire that she did not have with her. The men's division, by contrast, had no similar dress code. Balukas took a stand that the women should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> differently from the men, and accordingly refused to procure garments that would meet the unequal mandate.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the Army {{developed}} the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) concept from {{experiences in the}} European Theater. The US Army sought a highly mobile hospital unit which could be {{as close to the}} fighting as possible to increase the survival rate of casualties. These 60-bed, 124-man units would act as mobile hospitals for the treatment of wounded. By the beginning of the hostilities in Korea, all MASH units were undermanned and the difficult terrain in Korea prevented easy transport, making it very difficult for the MASH units to operate in the Pusan Perimeter battle. The 8055th MASH was the first such unit to arrive in Korea, being assigned to the 24th Infantry Division on July 9. Two more hospitals, the 8063rd and 8067th, would join the UN forces in the Pusan Perimeter fighting. The MASH units were routinely overwhelmed with patients due to shortages of transport, often receiving between 150 and 200 per day, although sometimes the number was high as 400. The units operated on men that were too critical to be transported. Those who could be moved or could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> in the MASH were taken by air or sea to US Army hospitals in Japan depending on the severity of their injuries.|$|E

25|$|Hero Cup was {{the first}} tournament to be {{broadcast}} live on a satellite channel, Star TV. Until the Hero Cup in 1993, state terrestrial broadcaster Doordarshan had a monopoly on broadcast of cricket matches in India. Doordarshan claimed violation of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 act, claiming the broadcast right was public property {{and had to be}} uplinked from India (Star TV uplinks from Hong Kong). The matter went up to the Supreme Court in 1995, which held that broadcast rights could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as public property.|$|E

This haplotype could not be found in other modern dogs; the nearest match was with a 1,000 year–old dog from Florida.|$|E
25|$|On a macro scale, one of {{the state}} and social organisations like {{multinational}} capitalist corporations, consider the example of globalization, which offers vast new opportunities for investment and development, but crises — like the Asian financial crisis — can affect the entire world, spreading far outside the local setting in which they first developed, and last but not least directly influences individuals. A serious explanation of such issues must lie somewhere within the network of macro and micro forces.

25|$|By {{producing}} the bulk concentrate, the total recovery of zinc for sale was maintained at over 70% until 1989. However, the high lead content {{meant that the}} bulk concentrate could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> by the electrolytic zinc process, {{and it had to}} be sold to zinc smelters using the more-expensive Imperial Smelting Process. Initially, MIM received good revenue from its bulk concentrate, but as the nature of the ore continued to deteriorate, the production of the bulk concentrate increased and saturated the market. Payment terms declined until MIM received less than half the payment for zinc in the bulk concentrate than it received for zinc in the zinc concentrate.|$|E
25|$|Superficially, the B-subgroup metals are the {{metals in}} Groups IB to VIB of the {{periodic}} table, corresponding to Groups 11 to 16 using current IUPAC nonmenclature.

40|$|Lamivudine, a {{nucleoside}} analogue, {{has been}} used widely as an effective antiviral agent {{for the treatment of}} patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, the YMDD motif mutation of HBV polymerase resistant to lamivudine occurs very frequently after long term therapy. We developed an oligonucleotide chip for the detection of YMDD motif mutants resistant to lamivudine and investigated the prevalence of the mutants in patients with chronic HBV infection who had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> by lamivudine before. Forty patients who had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> with lamivudine <b>were</b> included in this study. Serum samples were tested by the oligonucleotide chips designed for detection of wild-type YMDD motif, M 552 V and M 552 I. Samples were confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and direct sequencing. M 552 I mutants were detected by the oligonucleotide chips in 7. 5 % (3 / 40) of chronic HBV infected patients (2 chronic hepatitis and 1 cirrhosis). The results were in accordance with those of RFLP. YMDD motif mutants occur as natural genome variabilities in patients with chronic HBV infection who had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> with lamivudine before. Oligonucleotide chip technology is a reliable and useful diagnostic tool for the detection of mutants resistant to antiviral therapy in chronic HBV infection...|$|R
