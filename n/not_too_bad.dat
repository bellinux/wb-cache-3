The article noted that criticisms of the episode ranged from [...] "Kay's overacting and the silly Slitheen-esque monster to {{annoyance}} at how, well, lame the members of LINDA are." [...] Louisa Pearson of The Scotsman noted that hardcore fans would dislike the comedy and the [...] "panto" [...] performance of Kay, but commented, [...] "It's true, this episode came close to being a spoof, but it was actually quite nice to have a rest from the Doctor. Even saving the world gets boring sometimes." [...] Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave the episode a grade of D-. He was positive towards the first 30 minutes, which he described as a [...] "touching little tale" [...] with interesting characters, but called the final 10 minutes [...] "juvenile attack on the audience's intelligence and emotions" [...] that ruined the episode with [...] "a laughable monster and offensive humor at exactly the wrong moment". Digital Spy's Dek Hogan criticised Kay's performance, calling the Abzorbaloff [...] "a marvellous idea and it's a pity his creativity was absorbed by a turn from a visiting comedian". In a review of the series, Stephen Brook of The Guardian stated that he [...] "hated" [...] the episode, describing it as a [...] "parody of Doctor Who fans". The scene where Elton says he and Ursula have [...] "a bit of a love life" [...] was criticised by some commentators, who felt that the resultant implication of having oral sex with a paving slab was unsuitable for Doctor Whos large family audience; others, however, dismissed this dialogue as a harmless joke that children would not understand. [...] "Love & Monsters" [...] was placed in 153rd position in Doctor Who Magazine Mighty 200 reader survey in 2009, which ranked every Doctor Who story to that point in order of preference.|$|E

The groom backs away because he is reluctant {{to give up his}} life of wine and women in the city while the bride is unwilling because she wants to pursue an Engineering degree. The two draw up a few plans to stop the wedding, but they fizzle out.

2500|$|In early 1942, {{production}} of the Horsa commenced; by May 1942, some 2,345 had been ordered by the Army for use in future airborne operations. The glider was designed from the outset to be constructed using components {{and a series of}} 30 sub-assemblies required to complete the manufacturing process. Manufacturing was intended primarily to use woodcrafting facilities, which were not needed for more urgent aviation production, and as a result, production was spread across separate factories, which consequently limited the likely loss in case of German attack. The designer A. H. Tiltman said that the Horsa [...] "went from the drawing board to the air in ten months, which was <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> considering the drawings had to be made suitable for the furniture trade who were responsible for all production." ...|$|E

In the past decade, their strategies have evolved from total opacity to more transparency and, in some cases have matured enough to get closer to genuine global strategies while their relationships with the Russian government have strengthened. Thus Russian MNCs make up for major pillars of state capitalism in Russia. A comparative assessment with Chinese MNCs shows deeper similarities than differences in spite of the first mover advantage that has benefited to OFDI from China over OFDI from other transition economies, of which Russia...|$|R

60|$|This {{question}} as to the expense was much discussed by others in Carmarthen. Who in truth would pay the complicated lawyers' bill which must have been occasioned, including all these flys out to Llanfeare?

If so, he ought not only {{to be made to}} pay for everything, but be sent to prison also and tried for felony. The opinion concerning Cousin Henry in Carmarthen on the Thursday and Friday was very severe indeed. Had he shown himself in the town, he would almost have been pulled in pieces.

Mr Apjohn was, of course, the hero of the hour, and, as far as Carmarthen could see, Mr Apjohn would have to pay the bill.
