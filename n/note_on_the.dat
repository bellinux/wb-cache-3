5|$|Fishing is {{permitted}} {{at the state}} park, though anglers must descend the Turkey Path to reach Pine Creek. This has been designated as approved trout waters by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, which means the waters will be stocked with trout and may be fished during trout season. Other species of fish found in Pine Creek include smallmouth bass and some panfish. Several small trout streams are accessible from within the park, which had 2,597anglers in 2003. Historically, fishermen of <b>note</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stretch of Pine Creek in the park include President Theodore Roosevelt and Pennsylvania Governor William A. Stone.|$|E
5|$|He was {{particularly}} interested in dementia praecox (which he favored renaming schizophrenia), and found diffuse anatomic differences in the brains of schizophrenic patients. These changes were ignored or dismissed as artifactual by other investigators for several decades. Serious attention to Southard's findings did not reemerge in the medical literature until the 1990s, but changes in diagnostic criteria complicate the application of Southard's findings to modern schizophrenic patients. Shortly before his death Southard wrote and presented Non-dementia non-praecox: <b>note</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> advantages to mental hygiene of extirpating a term, but did not live to see it published.|$|E
5|$|Pipes are {{arranged}} by timbre and pitch into ranks. A rank {{is a set}} of pipes of the same timbre but multiple pitches (one for each <b>note</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> keyboard), which is mounted (usually vertically) onto a windchest. The stop mechanism admits air to each rank. For a given pipe to sound, the stop governing the pipe's rank must be engaged, and the key corresponding to its pitch must be depressed. Ranks of pipes are organized into groups called divisions. Each division generally is played from its own keyboard and conceptually comprises an individual instrument within the organ.|$|E

5|$|In 1610 the Constable {{gave the}} cup to a convent in Medina de Pomar, near Burgos, as the {{inscription}} describes. His deed of gift survives, and records that the gift was on condition that the cup was never alienated by the convent.

5|$|In 2002, P. Mausfeld and D. Vrcibradic {{published}} a <b>note</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nomenclature of the Noronha skink informed by a re-examination of Gray's original type specimens; despite extensive attempts to correctly name the species, they were apparently {{the first to}} do so since Boulenger in 1887. Based on differences {{in the number of}} scales, subdigital lamellae (lamellae on the lower sides of the digits), and keels (longitudinal ridges) on the dorsal scales (located on the upperparts), as well as the separation of the parietal scales (on the head behind the eyes) in maculata, they concluded that the two were not, after all, identical, and that Schmidt's name Mabuya atlantica should therefore be used. Mausfeld and Vrcibradic considered Mabouya punctatissima to represent a different species on the basis of morphological differences, but were unable to resolve the status of Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata.|$|E
