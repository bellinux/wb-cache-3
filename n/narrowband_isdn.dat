The key feature of ISDN is that it integrates speech and data on the same lines, adding features that were not available in the classic telephone system. The ISDN standards define several kinds of access interfaces, such as Basic Rate Interface (BRI), Primary Rate Interface (PRI), <b>Narrowband</b> <b>ISDN</b> (N-ISDN), and Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN).|$|E
40|$|The paper {{models and}} evaluates key design {{issues for the}} Adaptation Layer in ATM networks. The role and {{efficient}} design of the adaptation layer is crucial for future based on ATM. We concentrate on packet-mode adaptation services analyzing and simulating relevant protocols employed for <b>narrowband</b> <b>ISDN</b> signaling and packet data. Processing and transmission resources are modeled. In particular we investigate the performance of software based solution resident in microprocessors and interfaces to the ATM world via a generic interface component. This set-up which is currently under development is found adequate to handle <b>narrowband</b> <b>ISDN</b> signaling and data traffic. It offers a cost effective and readily available solution for the transition phase towards fully customized broadband components...|$|E

It shows a methodology how to structure a specification {{that it can}} be reused in derived specifications on structural level as well as on behavioural level. SDL provides adequate support for the composition of large specifications. There are difficulties, however, to extend signals, data and transitions in derived specifications.

The local optical communication network-LOCNET-will support <b>narrowband</b> services like <b>ISDN</b> telephone and data communication with 64 kbit/s, high speed data communication up to some 4 Mbit/s (so called mediumband services) and broadband services like videophone and other services with transmission rates up to 216 Mbit/s and even more.

40|$|Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN) {{extends the}} service {{integration}} concept to include future high speed, high volume network services {{as well as}} to accommodate <b>narrowband</b> <b>ISDN</b> in its infrastructure. The impact of B-ISDN services on satellite communications can be significant, requiring the same or similar quality of communications services provided by the terrestrial B-ISDN network. Potential satellite applications, alternate satellite network architectures, system design issues, and onboard switching/processing options for satellite B-ISDN services are investigated. Special attention is focused on fast packet switching architectures and switch design details to exploit the feasibility of implementing a fast packet switch in the future advanced communications satellite...|$|E
40|$|The BERKOM test {{network is}} a fibre optical network {{mainly in the}} western part of Berlin, {{providing}} <b>narrowband</b> <b>ISDN</b> interfaces with additional broadband channels up to a capacity of 140 Mbit/s. With respect to its geographical size it is a metropolitan area network but the transmission and switching technology of BERKOM is typical for wide area networks. The BERKOM test network is realized by means of two STM switches and one ATM switch, forming a high speed kernel in the 140 Mbit/s range. Various local area networks (802. 3, 802. 4, FDDI) with different protocol profiles are interconnected via BERKOM by means of appropriate interworking units...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the issue of}} {{increasing the number of}} connections that connection oriented networks, such as ATM, can handle. We describe one step that arises at reducing connection awareness inside the network. To that end, connections between the same pair of access nodes are grouped together and made indistinguishable inside the network. The concept of dynamic virtual path trunks is introduced as a support mechanism, and it is shown how virtual path links can be setup and maintained without additional round-trip delays. Keywords : connection awareness, multiplexed signaling, bandwidth re-negotiation. 1 Connection Limits for Network Nodes Support for real time traffic in communication networks requires that a connection oriented philosophy be employed. Some network technologies are connection oriented right from their definition : this is the case for ATM [1, 2], or <b>Narrowband</b> <b>ISDN</b> [3]. Some others initially based on connection-less principle, like bridged LANs or Internet [4], are int [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{intelligent}} network (IN) is a telecommunication network control architecture {{that separates the}} service delivery functionality from the service creation functionality. This permits new services to be developed and deployed more rapidly with minimal impact on the basic switching functionality. Broadband ISDN (BISDN), with ATM as the underlying transmission and switching scheme, is expected to support both the current narrowband services and the emerging broadband services such as multimedia communications. The IN call model has been specified for calls with a single bearer service, typically voice. This paper proposes an IN call model for BISDN where a call can have multiple bearer services, such as a videoconference call. A bottom-up approach is used whereby the experience gained in IN call models for <b>narrowband</b> <b>ISDN</b> is extended to BISDN.

40|$|An expository {{investigation}} of {{the potential impact of}} the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) at NASA Lewis Research Center is described. To properly frame the subject, the paper contains a detailed survey of the components of <b>Narrowband</b> <b>ISDN.</b> The principles and objectives are presented as decreed by the Consultative Committee for International Telephone and Telegraph (CCITT). The various channel types are delineated and their associated service combinations are described. The subscriber-access network functions are explained pictorially via the ISDN reference configuration. A section on switching techniques is presented to enable the reader to understand the emergence of the concept of fast packet switching. This new technology is designed to operate over the high bandwidth, low error rate transmission media that characterizes the LeRC environment. A brief introduction to the next generation of networks is covered with sections on Broadband ISDM (B-ISDN), Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), and Synchronous Optical Networks (SONET). Applications at LeRC are presented, first in terms of targets of opportunity, then in light of compatibility constraints. In-place pilot projects and testing are described that demonstrate actual usage at LeRC...|$|E
40|$|This article {{summarizes}} the work carried out within the ACTS project INSIGNIA, which is targeted at {{the provision of}} interactive multimedia services through IN and B-ISDN integration. The basic concepts regarding the integrated approach are discussed with emphasis on the functional architecture. This discussion {{is followed by a}} presentation of IN multimedia services which were created based on these principles. An overview of the real-life trials which were conducted on a pan-European basis in order to evaluate the INSIGNIA services is also given. The results of this evaluation are examined from a variety of viewpoints, including functional architecture, user and network equipment, service logic programs and applications, as well as user acceptance and network performance. he provision of multimedia services on a univer-T sal basis in a cost effective way is a challenging task for telecommunication networks in the near future. The technological components are already available: both desktop applications and transport technologies are mature enough to provide amazing multimedia services in specific contexts such as local area networks. The challenge is how to provide these services with no constraints in space and time at a reasonable cost. The Internet is now really universal, but the support of broadband multimedia channels with the desired quality is still an open issue. The deployment of public ATM networks which can also offer broadband ISDN (B-ISDN) access still seems an interesting option. One of the major arguments against the B-ISDN architecture is the complexity of protocols to provide multimedia services as network services. The length of the standardization process is another heavy burden. The intelligent network (IN) architecture, which is successfully used in the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and <b>narrowband</b> <b>ISDN</b> (N-ISDN), can complement the B-ISDN, providing a higher degree of flexibility to build services over components and simplifying the standardization process...|$|E
