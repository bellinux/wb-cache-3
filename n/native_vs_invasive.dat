40|$|Recent {{reports on}} tree {{mortality}} associated with anomalous drought and heat have raised interest into processes underlying tree resistance/resilience to water stress. Hydraulic failure and carbon starvation {{have been proposed}} as main causes of tree decline, with recent theories treating water and carbon metabolism as interconnected processes. We subjected young plants of two native (Quercus pubescens [Qp] and Prunus mahaleb [Pm]) and two invasive (Robinia pseudoacacia [Rp] and Ailanthus altissima [Aa]) woody angiosperms to a prolonged drought leading to stomatal closure and xylem embolism, to induce carbon starvation and hydraulic failure. At {{the end of the}} treatment, plants were measured for embolism rates and NSC content, and re-irrigated to monitor recovery of xylem hydraulics. Data highlight different hydraulic strategies in <b>native</b> <b>vs</b> <b>invasive</b> species under water stress, and provide physiological explanations for species-specific impacts of recent severe droughts. Drought-sensitive species (Qp and Rp) suffered high embolism rates and were unable to completely refill xylem conduits upon restoration of water availability. Species that better survived recent droughts were able to limit embolism build-up (Pm) or efficiently restored hydraulic functionality after irrigation (Aa). Species-specific capacity to reverse xylem embolism correlated to stem-level concentration of soluble carbohydrates, but not to starch content. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS...|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by Inter-Research {{and can be}} found at: [URL] red lionfish Pterois volitans have invaded Atlantic reefs and reached much greater population densities than on native reefs. We hypothesized that lionfish on invaded reefs would (1) experience higher kill rates and thus spend less time hunting, given the naïveté of Atlantic prey, (2) consume a greater variety of prey, given the lack of native prey defenses, and (3) display less pronounced crepuscular patterns of hunting, given the ease of capturing Atlantic prey. Comparative behavioral observations were conducted in 2 native regions (Philippines and Guam) and 2 invaded regions (Cayman Islands and Bahamas) to assess lionfish time budgets and diurnal activity patterns and to explore correlations between environmental variables and lionfish behavior. Contrary to our first hypothesis, total time allocated to hunting and kill rates showed no difference between native and invaded reefs, despite considerable regional variation. However, Atlantic prey of lionfish were twice as large as Pacific prey, suggesting that despite similar hunting behavior, invasive lionfish ingest greater daily rations of prey biomass. Furthermore, consistent with our second hypothesis, lionfish on invaded reefs had broader diets, and also relied less on ‘blowing’ behavior for prey capture, pointing to substantial prey naïveté in the invaded range. Importantly, only in the invaded range did we observe lionfish consuming parrotfishes, the decline of which could have indirect effects on interactions between seaweeds and corals. Finally, lionfish overall tended to exhibit a crepuscular pattern in behavior whereby hunting peaked at sunrise and/or sunset, with no differences attributable to <b>native</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>invasive</b> status...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} and spread of non-native species {{has become a}} global ecological and environmental problem. We {{will be able to}} develop a deeper understanding on the background of invasiveness from the studies of evolutionary changes that invasive species undergo from their introduction to the establishment and aggressive spread. The ultimate goal of this dissertation is to contribute a deeper knowledge on the ability of invasive species to respond to the novel environment and prevail via evolutionary changes, using purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria L. Lythraceae) as a model system.;The dissertation is composed of several journal papers. Chapter 1 is a general {{introduction and}} Chapter 2 is a review paper summarizing recent studies on the leading hypotheses on the mechanisms for invasiveness: EICA (Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability), the evolution of phenotypic plasticity, local adaptation, allelopathy, hybridization/polyploidization. Chapter 3 tests the evolution of phenotypic plasticity hypothesis with an empirical study on the phenotypic plasticity in <b>native</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>invasive</b> populations subject to experimentally manipulated water and nutrient environments. This study has been published in Ecology and expanded into a larger international collaborative project that aims to detect the genetic difference in demography and phenotypic plasticity between native and invasive populations. Essentially this is a reciprocal transplant study with multiple common gardens involving collaborators from New Jersey and Germany. The results from the Iowa common garden have been presented in Chapter 4, employing structural equation modeling approach (path analysis) to describe causal relationships between fitness and traits that contribute to fitness (fitness-related traits) considering the ontogeny of purple loosestrife. Chapter 5 is a technical note on the development of a genomic DNA extraction protocol for plants that have a large amount of secondary metabolites including polysaccharides and polyphenols. Chapter 6 is a population genetic study on the same populations used in Chapter 3, to examine the effect of major evolutionary forces on invasive populations - whether the formation of invasive populations is purely due to stochastic events such as genetic drift and migration, or instead by disruptive and/or stabilizing selection leading to locally adapted populations in the North America...|$|E

40|$|The sweetpotato {{whitefly}} Bemisia tabaci is {{a highly}} destructive agricultural and ornamental crop pest. It damages host plants through both phloem feeding and vectoring plant pathogens. Introductions of B. tabaci are difficult to quarantine and eradicate because of its high reproductive rates, broad host plant range, and insecticide resistance. A total of 791 Gb of raw DNA sequence from whole genome shotgun sequencing, and 13 BAC pooling libraries were generated by Illumina sequencing using different combinations of mate-pair and pair-end libraries. Assembly gave a final genome with a scaffold N 50 of 437 kb, and a total length of 658 Mb. Annotation of repetitive elements and coding regions resulted in 265. 0 Mb TEs (40. 3 %) and 20 786 protein-coding genes with putative gene family expansions, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on orthologs across 14 arthropod taxa suggested that MED/Q is clustered into a hemipteran clade containing A. pisum and is a sister lineage to a clade containing both R. prolixus and N. lugens. Genome completeness, as estimated using the CEGMA and Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs pipelines, reached 96 % and 79 %.

40|$|Seed {{disperser}} preferences may {{mediate the}} impact of invasive, non-native plant species on their new ecological communities. Significant seed disperser preference for invasives over native species could facilitate {{the spread of the}} invasives while impeding native plant dispersal. Such competition for dispersers could negatively impact the fitness of some native plants. Here, we review published literature to identify circumstances under which preference for non-native fruits occurs. The importance of fruit attraction is underscored by several studies demonstrating that invasive, fleshy-fruited plant species are particularly attractive to regional frugivores. A small set of studies directly compare frugivore preference for <b>native</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>invasive</b> species, and we find that different designs and goals within such studies frequently yield contrasting results. When similar native and non-native plant species have been compared, frugivores have tended to show preference for the non-natives. This preference appears to stem from enhanced feeding efficiency or accessibility associated with the non-native fruits. On the other hand, studies examining preference within existing suites of co-occurring species, with no attempt to maximize fruit similarity, show mixed results, with frugivores in most cases acting opportunistically or preferring native species. A simple, exploratory meta-analysis finds significant preference for native species when these studies are examined as a group. We illustrate the contrasting findings typical of these two approaches with results from two smallscale aviary experiments we conducted to determine preference by frugivorous bird species in northern California. In these case studies, native birds preferred the native fruit species {{as long as it was}} dissimilar from non-native fruits, while non-native European starlings preferred non-native fruit. However, native birds showed slight, non-significant preference for non-native fruit species when such fruits were selected for their physical resemblance to the native fruit species. Based on our review and case studies, we propose that fruit characteristics of native plant communities could dictate how well a non-native, fleshy-fruited plant species competes for dispersers with natives. Native bird preferences may be largely influenced by regional native fruits, such that birds are attracted to the colors, morphology, and infructescence structures characteristic of preferred native fruits. Non-native fruits exhibiting similar traits are likely to encounter bird communities predisposed to consume them. If those non-natives offer greater fruit abundance, energy content, or accessibility, they may outcompete native plants for dispersers...|$|E
40|$|Conversational entrainment, a {{pervasive}} communication phenomenon in which dialogue partners adapt their behaviors to align {{more closely with}} one another, is considered essential for successful spoken interaction. While well-established in other disciplines, this phenomenon has received limited attention {{in the field of}} speech pathology and the study of communication breakdowns in clinical populations. The current study examined acoustic-prosodic entrainment, as well as a measure of communicative success, in three distinctly different dialogue groups: (i) healthy <b>native</b> <b>vs.</b> healthy <b>native</b> speakers (Control), (ii) healthy <b>native</b> <b>vs.</b> foreign-accented speakers (Accented), and (iii) healthy <b>native</b> <b>vs.</b> dysarthric speakers (Disordered). Dialogue group comparisons revealed significant differences in how the groups entrain on particular acoustic–prosodic features, including pitch, intensity, and jitter. Most notably, the Disordered dialogues were characterized by significantly less acoustic-prosodic entrainment than the Control dialogues. Further, a positive relationship between entrainment indices and communicative success was identified. These results suggest that the study of conversational entrainment in speech pathology will have essential implications for both scientific theory and clinical application in this domain...|$|R

MethodsFrom January 2002 to January 2011, 775 patients underwent surgery for active left-sided IE. Registries were queried, and endocarditis-related pathology {{was based on the}} echocardiographic findings and operative notes. Propensity adjustment and matching (55 pairs) were used for risk-adjusted outcome comparisons between the invasive aortic and mitral cases. ResultsA total of 395 patients had isolated aortic (PVE 59 %, invasive 68 %), 238 isolated mitral (PVE 29 %, invasive 35 %), and 142 combined aortic and mitral (PVE 44 %, invasive 69 %) IE. The 30 -day survival was 92 % and was similar for native valve endocarditis and PVE in all 3 valve combinations. Invasive versus noninvasive IE was associated with greater hospital mortality (11 % vs 4. 4 %, P = . 001). Patients with invasive IE had worse intermediate-term survival than those with noninvasive IE for mitral (P = . 001) and aortic plus mitral (P = . 02) IE but not for isolated aortic IE. This difference persisted in the matched patients. ConclusionsDuring the past decade, we have had low hospital mortality for surgically treated left-sided IE and have neutralized the added risk of PVE. However, outcomes remain worse for mitral versus aortic valve IE, with residual obstacles related to patient factors, inherent mitral valve anatomy in patients with invasive disease, and lack of an alternative mitral valve prosthesis optimal for IE...|$|R

40|$|Given their global importance, coastal marine environments are a {{major focus}} of concern {{regarding}} the potential impacts of climate change, namely due to alterations in seawater salinity. It is known that environmental characteristics, such as salinity, affect immune and physiological parameters of bivalves. Nevertheless, scarce information is available concerning the biochemical alterations associated with salinity changes. For this reason, the present work aimed to evaluate the biochemical responses of three venerid clam species (Venerupis decussata, Venerupis corrugata, Venerupis philippinarum) submitted to salinity changes. The effects on the <b>native</b> (<b>V.</b> decussata and <b>V.</b> corrugata) and <b>invasive</b> (<b>V.</b> philippinarum) species collected from the same sampling site and submitted to the same salinity gradient (0 to 42. g/L) were compared. The results obtained demonstrated that V. corrugata is the most sensitive species to salinity changes and V. decussata is the species that can tolerate a wider range of salinities. Furthermore, our work showed that clams under salinity associated stress can alter their biochemical mechanisms, such as increasing their antioxidant defenses, to cope with the higher oxidative stress resulting from hypo and hypersaline conditions.

We reviewed our experience with cryoplasty to determine its outcome treating patients with lesions in native vessels and within stents. MethodsA retrospective review of all patients undergoing cryotherapy between 2004 and 2008 was conducted. Patency was defined by {{at least one of the}} following criteria: flow through the vessel demonstrated by angiography or duplex ultrasonography, maintenance of an ankle-brachial index (ABI) greater than 0. 10 above the preprocedural value, or maintenance of a palpable pedal pulse that was absent before the procedure in an asymptomatic patient. Patency, limb salvage, symptomatic improvement, and freedom from surgical bypass were determined with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and compared by log-rank testing. Multivariate analysis was performed by Cox proportional-hazards regression. ResultsEighty-eight cryoplasty procedures were performed in 71 patients, with 35 procedures for in-stent restenosis and 37 for native vessel disease. Sixteen of 88 procedures in grafts were excluded from analysis secondary to combined disease process and/or bypass graft stenosis. Lesions treated with cryoplasty had an average of 2. 9 prior endovascular interventions. Eighty-five percent of the lesions were described as complex (multifocal, diffuse, or occlusion) and the mean lesion length was 15 ± 10 cm. Initial cryoplasty technical success rate was 68 % (25 of 37) for native vessels and 71 % (25 of 35) for in-stent procedures. One year primary patency for the <b>native</b> <b>vs</b> stent group was 17 % vs 28 %, respectively (P =. 18). The 1 -year primary assisted patency for the <b>native</b> <b>vs</b> stent group was 28 % vs 47 %, respectively (P =. 33). The 1 -year secondary patency for the <b>native</b> <b>vs</b> stent group was 41 % vs 57 % (P =. 42), respectively. Freedom from claudication at 1 year for the <b>native</b> <b>vs</b> stent group was 32 % vs 21 % (P =. 80). Compared to balloon angioplasty, cryoplasty has an averaged up-cost of $ 1851. 50 per procedure. ConclusionCryoplasty was used in patients with extensive disease and multiple prior interventions. Cryoplasty provided poor patency rates and poor relief from claudication at 1 year in this population.

40|$|While it is {{accepted}} that viruses can enter epithelial cells by endocytosis, {{the lack of}} an established biological mechanism for the trafficking of infectious virions through vaginal epithelial cells and their release from the plasma membrane has contributed to ongoing controversy about whether endocytosis is a mere artifact of some cell culture systems and whether squamous vaginal epithelial cells are even relevant as it pertains to HIV- 1 transmission. In this study, we investigated the intracellular trafficking pathway that HIV- 1 exploits to transcytose vaginal epithelial cells. The reduction of endosome tubulation by recycling endosome inhibitors blocked transcytosis of HIV- 1 in a cell culture and transwell system. In addition, we demonstrate that although heat-inactivated virus was endocytosed as efficiently as native virus, heat-inactivated virus was trafficked exclusively to the lysosomal pathway for degradation following endocytosis. Lysosomal protease-specific inhibitors blocked the degradation of inactivated virions. Immunofluorescence analysis not only demonstrated that HIV- 1 was inside the cells but the different colocalization pattern of <b>native</b> <b>vs.</b> heat inactivated virus with transferrin provided conclusive evidence that HIV- 1 uses the recycling pathway to get across vaginal epithelial cells.
