For this, two basic problems are distinguished: the conceptual problem and the justifiable problem. The answer to the first problem, is to construct a concept starting from its context of application, which is delimited by three criteria: the absence of consensus and common values, the identification of the fundamental rights for a democratic and pluralist society and the identification of formal, structural and textual elements that affect the magnitude of the Margin of Appreciation. Conceptually these three criteria are delimited and the importance of the latter is shown, particularly the distinction between absolute and <b>non-absolute</b> <b>rights</b> and the difference between limitations and exceptions. The answer to the second problem seeks to elucidate a justification of this doctrine, articulating the above three criteria from the value pluralism, which allows to counter the accusation of relativism that weighs on this doctrine, based on the idea of the objectivity of the values that the value pluralism holds. The aim here is to show that the Margin of Appreciation doctrine would not be an obstacle to the construction of a common understanding of the rights and freedoms enshrined in the Convention, considering the limitations that Member States can make to them. In light of these limitations, the doctrine is conceived as an interpretative principle of the rights of the Convention containing a limitation clause, aimed at achieving some flexibility in the process of implementation of these rights by the Member States, seeking to preserve their contextual differences, but, at the same time, the ethos of the Convention, expressed in the structural values of democracy and pluralism. The aim of the Court is therefore to guarantee a composable or practicable system of rights and freedoms in a diverse Europe...|$|E

Many states tend to use instruments and take measures that infringe upon human rights and individual freedoms in order to protect national security. At the same time, UN Security Council resolutions stress that the 'fight against tarrorism' should take place within the borders set by the rule of law, by international human rights treaties and international humanitarian law. Next to that, international human rights contain a certain 'positive obligation' for states to adequately protect national security and the right to life of the population against terrorist attacks. Therefore, there is a tense and also complicated relation between human rights and national security. The question arises whether {{there is a way to}} secure that human rights and national security are compatible entities. This study analyses the relevant articles from human rights treaties and the jurisprudence of international monitoring organs (European Court of Human Rights/UN Human Rights Committee) in order to find out whether international law leaves room for states to limit or even derogate human rights in states of emergency or other situations that threaten national security. The study shows that international law indeed does leave some room, but only limited. In very serious crises that amount to a public emergency threatening the life of the nation, states may derogate from the ordinary level of human right protection, but even during such serious crisis situations there is no 'carte blanche' for states to take any measures they deem necessary. Certain human rights are given absolute protection, even in crisis situations, and emergency measures that interfere with <b>non-absolute</b> human <b>rights</b> should pass a test of strict necessity and proportionality. In this field new norms and concepts have been developed during the last decades. It is, however, clear that the international monitoring of human rights protection during states of emergency and other severe crises needs improvement. Promotor: E. A.
