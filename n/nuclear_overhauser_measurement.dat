The {{conformational}} flexibility {{inherent in}} the polynucleotide chain {{plays an important role}} in deciding its three-dimensonal structure and enables it to undergo structural transitions in order to fulfil all its functions. Following certain stereochemical guidelines, both right and left handed double-helical models have been built in our laboratory and they are in reasonably good agreement with the fibre patterns for various polymorphous forms of DNA. Recently, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has become an important technique for studying the solution conformation and polymorphism of nucleic acids. Several workers have used 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance <b>nuclear</b> <b>Overhauser</b> enhancement <b>measurements</b> to estimate the interproton distances for the various DNA oligomers and compared them with the-interproton distances for particular models of A and Β form DNA.

The complete assignments for the low-spin, dicyano complex were effected by a combination of partial isotope labeling, paramagnetic relaxation, multiplet structure, and <b>nuclear</b> <b>Overhauser</b> <b>measurements</b> in viscous solvent. The resulting contact shift pattern reflects Ï€ spin delocalization into both the highest filled MO equivalent to the porphyrin 3 eÏ€(xz,yz), as well as into the former a 1 u orbital of the porphyrin. The saturation of a pyrrole ring to produce a chlorin is concluded to uniquely stabilize the orbital ground state of the iron, which allows the lone spin to Ï€ bond to the two unmodified trans-pyrroles. The pattern of contact shift asymmetry of the pyrroles adjacent to the saturated ring provides a potential model for interpreting NMR spectra of iron chlorin enzymes.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} use of {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{as a tool for}} the refinement of structures based on NMR data. The procedure always involves the construction of a pseudo-energy term to model the experimental data and we consider the various approaches to this problem. We detail recent work where we account for the time averaging implicit in NMR measurements and attempt to model the experimental data more realistically. Finally, we discuss the problems and approximations involved in this work, the lack of consensus as to refinement methods and the scope for future developments. 1.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{solution}} {{structure of}} the self-complementary D N A hexamer 5 ’d(GCATGC) 2 comprising the specific target site for the restriction endonuclease Sphl is investigated by using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and restrained molecular dynamics. All the nonexchangeable proton resonances are assigned sequentially, and from time-dependent <b>nuclear</b> <b>Overhauser</b> enhancement <b>measurements</b> a set of 158 approximate interproton distances are determined. These distances are {{used as the basis}} of a structure refinement using restrained molecular dynamics in which the interproton distances are incorporated into the total energy function of the system {{in the form of an}} effective potential term. Two restrained molecular dynamics simulations are carried out, starting from classical B- and A-DNA [atomic root mean square (rms) difference 3. 3 A]. In both cases convergence is achieved to essentially identical structures satisfying the experimental restraints and having a root mean square difference of only 0. 3 A between them, which is within the rms fluctuations of the atoms about their average positions. These results suggest that the restrained molecular dynamics structures represent reasonable approximations of the solution structure. The converged structures are of the B type and exhibit clear sequence-dependent variations of helical parameters, some of which follow Calladine’s rules and can be attributed to the relief of interstrand purine-purine clash at adjacent base pairs. In addition, the converged restrained dynamics structures appear bent with a radiu...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} induce a beta-turn {{conformation}} into the chemotactic linear tripeptide N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP), the new analogue N-formyl-L-methionyl-delta Z leucyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester [delta Z Leu] 2 fMLP-OMe (1) has been synthesized. The conformational and biochemical {{consequences of this}} chemical modification have been determined. Analogue 1 has been synthesized by using N-carboxy-(Z) -alpha,beta-didehydroleucine anhydride as key compound to introduce the unsaturated residue at the central position of the tripeptide 1. The x-ray analysis shows that 1 adopts in the crystal a type II beta-turn conformation in which the new residue occupies the (i + 2) position, and an intramolecular H bond is formed between the formylic oxygen and the Phe NH. 1 H-nmr analysis based on <b>nuclear</b> <b>Overhauser</b> effect <b>measurements</b> suggests that the same folded conformation is preferred in CDCl 3 solution; this finding is also supported by molecular dynamics simulation. The biological activity of 1 has been determined on human neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) and compared to that shown by fMLP-OMe. Chemotactic activity, granule enzyme release, and superoxide anion production have been determined. Analogue 1 is practically inactive as chemoattractant, highly active in the superoxide generation, and similar to the parent in the lysozyme release. The conformational restriction imposed on the backbone {{by the presence of}} the unsaturated residue is discussed in relation with the observed bioselectivity...|$|R
