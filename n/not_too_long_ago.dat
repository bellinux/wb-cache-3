25|$|Terengganu {{used to be}} Malaysia's poorest state until oil and gas were {{discovered}} off its coastline <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago.</b> Terengganu's main industry now is petroleum and gas. There are huge petrochemical complexes near Paka and Kerteh, involving many joint ventures between the Malaysian national oil company, Petronas, and foreign multinationals. Tourism and fishing are also major industries in Terengganu, a state with a long coastline. Agriculture also remains important, with banana, rambutan, durian, watermelon, and various other fruits and vegetables available in season. Terengganu was traditionally famous for boat-building, with highly decorated carved wooden boats called bangau {{to be found in}} the harbour of every village and town in days not so long gone by, before electric motorboats became standard equipment for the state's fishermen.|$|E
500|$|As one of {{the founders}} of the {{cyberpunk}} genre, William Gibson has repeatedly been asked for his opinion on the subject of the mainstreaming of cyberpunk, which has often brought up the topic of Idol's album. In a 1994 interview, Gibson said that he did not approve of the way the term [...] "cyberpunk" [...] was being increasingly commercialised by popular culture, and that Idol had [...] "turned it into something very silly." [...] Gibson also said in another interview that to understand cyberpunk as a movement was [...] "something of a joke, as wonderfully demonstrated, <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago,</b> by Billy Idol's Cyberpunk album." [...] Despite his negative comments, Gibson was bemused, rather than angered, by Idol's creation. Stating that he'd tried to withhold judgment before hearing the album, he eventually did and said [...] "...I just don't get what he's on about. I don't see the connection. [...] I had lunch with Billy years ago in Hollywood... and I thought he was a very likeable guy. He had a sense of humour about what he was doing that is not apparent in the product he puts out. If I run into him again, we can have a good laugh about what he's doing now!" ...|$|E

Then, <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> time <b>ago,</b> digital devices, especially social media have begun to grow the popularity.

40|$|When {{an astronomical}} {{observer}} discovers a transient {{event in the}} sky, how can the information be immediately shared and delivered to others? <b>Not</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> time <b>ago,</b> people shared the information about what they discovered in the sky by books, telegraphs, and telephones. The new generation of transferring the event data is the way by the Internet. The information of astronomical events is able to be packed and put online as an Internet feed. For receiving these packed data, an Internet feed listener software would be required in a terminal computer. In other applications, the listener would connect to an intelligent robotic telescope network and automatically drive a telescope to capture the instant Astrophysical phenomena. However, because the technologies of transferring the astronomical event data are in the initial steps, the only resource available is the Perl-based Internet feed listener developed by the team of eSTAR. In this research, a Java-based Internet feed listener was developed. The application supports more features than the Perl-based application. After applying the rich Java benefits, the application is able to receive, parse and manage the Internet feed data in an efficient way with the friendly user interface.

40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. Bibliogr. s. 42. Geotourists and {{unconventional}} tourists will be definitely {{interested in}} the Danakil Valley. It is rarely visited place but absolutely extraordinary in many ways. It is {{in an area of}} divergence of lithosphere plates and, therefore connected to that, seismic and volcanic activity can be observed. Stunning terrain forms, geological structures, colours and diversity seem to be unreal. This desert is very inhospitable due to poisonous exhalations, omnipresent salt, an extremely hot climate, water deficiency and the fact that fauna and flora don't exist here. Despite all of these inconveniences, the Danakil Valley is inhabited by the Afars, a population thriving mainly on primitive salt production. Their rare culture is worth attention <b>too.</b> <b>Not</b> so <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> they were hostile and even now natives can be unpredictable and dangerous. Additionally, visitors should remember other difficulties: legal, organisational, financial and, above all, natural and climatic ones. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.
