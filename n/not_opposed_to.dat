5|$|Following {{the example}} of de Gaulle, who refused {{proposals}} for an integrated Europe, Houphouët-Boigny opposed Nkrumah's proposed United States of Africa, which called into question Côte d'Ivoire's recently acquired national sovereignty. However, Houphouët-Boigny was <b>not</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> collective African institutions if they were subject to his influence or control.|$|E
5|$|Norving (previously Varangfly) started {{offering}} {{flights to}} the closed-down military airport in 1970 using their newly delivered Britten-Norman Islander. The background was a landing at the airfield to transport {{a baby to}} Kirkenes Hospital. The Civil Aviation Administration stated that they were <b>not</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> building smaller ambulance airports, but that the state's priority was constructing a network of regional airports. The service started off with a daily round trip ordered by the district physician; patients had priority, but the airline would transport other passengers as well. After a month a second daily round trip was introduced.|$|E

Its employees have stated that, {{while they are}} <b>not</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> making action-oriented games, they believe that enough such titles are released by the established video game industry. When designing a game, Thatgamecompany employees start by mapping out what they want the player to feel, rather than by establishing game mechanics. Employees have stated that the company does not plan to produce large, blockbuster titles, due to their belief that the pressure for high sales would stifle innovation.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} {{proposal for a}} connection between Bømlo and Stord {{was made in the}} 1960s by sheriff, and later mayor of Fitjar, Finn Havnerås. Christened the Island Road, he proposed a series of eleven bridges and causeways which would run from Kalveid in Fitjar via Brandasund to Rolfsnes in Bømlo. While local politicians were <b>not</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> the plan, the recent municipal merger between Bømlo, Bremnes and Moster made them prioritize other sectors and the project was abandoned without any official investigations.|$|E
5|$|By 1547, {{opposition}} to Calvin and other French refugee ministers {{had grown to}} constitute {{the majority of the}} syndics, the civil magistrates of Geneva. On 27 June an unsigned threatening letter in Genevan dialect was found at the pulpit of St. Pierre Cathedral where Calvin preached. Suspecting a plot against both the church and the state, the council appointed a commission to investigate. Jacques Gruet, a Genevan member of Favre's group, was arrested and incriminating evidence was found when his house was searched. Under torture, he confessed to several crimes including writing the letter left in the pulpit which threatened the church leaders. A civil court condemned Gruet to death and he was beheaded on 26 July. Calvin was <b>not</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> the civil court's decision.|$|E
5|$|In 1299, George's son and Aldimir's nephew Theodore Svetoslav (r. 1300–1322), the {{legitimate}} {{successor to the}} Bulgarian throne, invaded Bulgaria along with Tatar troops. The news of that invasion was enough to force Smiltsena and Ivan to flee to the despotate of Kran even before Theodore Svetoslav's troops had reached the capital. Aldimir gave refuge to Smiltsena and Ivan, though he was clearly <b>not</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> his newly crowned nephew. In 1300, Smilets' brother sebastokrator Radoslav headed a Byzantine-supported campaign against Aldimir {{en route to the}} capital. However, the attack had disastrous consequences to Radoslav. He was captured by Aldimir, blinded and forced back to Thessaloniki, while his Byzantine generals were sent as captives to Theodore Svetoslav. With this act, Aldimir pledged his allegiance to Theodore Svetoslav, who rewarded him with an extension to his appanage. The despotate of Kran was enlarged to the east to include the fortresses of Yambol and Lardea near today's Karnobat.|$|E

5|$|Urse {{earned a}} {{reputation}} for extortion and financial exactions. During the reign of William II, he was considered {{second only to the}} king's minister Ranulf Flambard in his rapacity. The first mention of his exactions is in Hemming's Cartulary. Further details were given by the medieval chroniclers William of Malmesbury and Gerald of Wales, both of whom relate Ealdred's curse. His exactions were also mentioned in Domesday Book, where an entry in the survey for Gloucestershire noted that his oppression prevented the inhabitants of Sodbury so much that they were unable to pay their customary rents. He intimidated the monks of the Worcester cathedral chapter into granting him a lease of two of their estates, Greenhill and Eastbury. Urse was one of a new breed of royal official, one who was <b>not</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> royal power but rather welcomed it, as it helped his own position.|$|E

Evolution is incorporated in the science curriculum starting from the 5th grade.
