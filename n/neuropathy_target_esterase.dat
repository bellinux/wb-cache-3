40|$|ABSTRACT: Recently, we {{reported}} that mutations in the neu-ropathy <b>target</b> <b>esterase</b> (NTE) gene cause autosomal recessive {{motor neuron disease}} (NTE-MND). We describe clinical, neuro-physiologic, and neuroimaging features of affected subjects in the index families. NTE-MND subjects exhibited progressive lower extremity spastic weakness that began in childhood and was later associated with atrophy of distal leg and intrinsic hand muscles. NTE-MND resembles Troyer syndrome, except that short stature, cognitive impairment, and dysmorphic fea-tures, which often accompany Troyer syndrome, are not fea-tures of NTE-MND. Early onset, symmetry, and slow progression distinguish NTE-MND from typical amyotrophic lat-eral sclerosis. NTE is implicated in organophosphorus com-pound–induced delayed neurotoxicity (OPIDN).

Optimal experimental conditions required a semiconductor concentration of 0. 1 with 3. 8 mW/cm(2) UV-A radiance intensity. Cell viability was monitored by plasma membrane permeability and loss of enzymatic activity using double fluorescent dye staining and flow cytometry. Plasma membrane permeability and enzymatic activity were almost simultaneously <b>targeted.</b> <b>Esterase</b> enzymatic activity decreased progressively, suggesting that the intracellular protein pool was sequentially damaged by the treatment.

A massive loss of potassium, major cation in yeast, that was released first and in large amounts, remained constant beyond 5 h of treatment and was correlated to the number of damaged membrane-cells. On the contrary, ammonium ions concentration gradually increased, suggesting their generation through the photocatalytic process, probably via amino acid and protein degradation. Oxamic and oxalic acid that could also arise from damages to amino acids were detected. Amino acid analysis revealed a main component, increasing over time, corresponding to glycine.

50|$|Tissues that {{comprise}} the kidneys, skin, and eyes are often subjected to osmotic stresses. When the extracellular environment is hypertonic, cells lose water and consequently, shrink. To counteract this, cells increase their sodium uptake in order to lose less water. However, an increase in intracellular ionic concentration is harmful to the cell. Cells can alternatively synthesize enzymes and transporters that increase intracellular concentration of organic osmolytes, which are less toxic than excess ions but which also aid in water retention. Under conditions of hyperosmolarity, NFAT5 is synthesized and accumulates in the nucleus.

Irreversible inhibition of NTE by certain organophosphorus compounds produces a paralysis known as organophosphorus compound-induced delayed neuropathy.

NTE's physiological role is not well understood, although recent studies suggest that it may control the cytotoxic accumulation of lysophospholipids in membranes. We used the NTE catalytic domain (NEST) to hydrolyze palmitoyl- 2 -hydroxy-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (p-lysoPC) to palmitic acid in bilayer membranes comprising 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DOPC) and the fluorophore 1 -oleoyl- 2 -[12 -[(7 -nitro- 2 - 1, 3 -benzoxadiazol- 4 -yl) amino]dodecanoyl]-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (NBD-PC). Translational diffusion coefficients (DL) in supported bilayer membranes were measured by fluorescence recovery after pattern photobleaching (FRAPP). The average DL for DOPC/p-lysoPC membranes without NEST was 2. 44 µm 2 s- 1 ± 0. 09; the DL for DOPC/p-lysoPC membranes containing NEST and diisopropylphosphorofluoridate, an inhibitor, was nearly identical at 2. 45 ± 0. 08. By contrast, the DL for membranes comprising NEST, DOPC, and p-lysoPC was 2. 28 ± 0. 07, significantly different from the system with inhibited NEST, due to NEST hydrolysis. Likewise, a system without NEST containing the amount of palmitic acid that would have been produced by NEST hydrolysis of p-lysoPC was identical at 2. 26 ± 0. 06.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} salicylic acid-binding protein 2 (SABP 2) of tobacco {{is an integral}} component of systemic acquired resistance (SAR). SABP 2 is a methyl salicylate (MeSA) esterase that has high affinity for SA, which feedback inhibits its esterase activity. MeSA esterase activity is required in distal, healthy tissue of pathogen-infected plants to hydrolyze MeSA, which functions as a long-distance, phloem-mobile SAR signal; this hydrolysis releases the biologically active defense hormone SA. In this study, we examined the inhibitory interaction of SA with SABP 2, and identified a synthetic SA analog, 2, 2, 2, 2 ′-tetra-f luoroacetophenone (tetraFA) that, like SA, competitively inhibits the activity of SABP 2 and <b>targets</b> <b>esterases,</b> which utilize MeSA as a substrate. However, in contrast to SA, tetraFA does not induce downstream defense responses and, therefore, is effective in planta at blocking SAR development in tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) -infected tobacco and Pseudomonas syringae-infected Arabidopsis. These results confirm the importance of SABP 2 and MeSA for SAR development in tobacco and establish similar roles for MeSA and the orthologs of SABP 2 in Arabidopsis. Moreover, they demonstrate that tetraFA {{can be used to}} determine whether MeSA and its corresponding esterase(s) play a role in SAR signaling in other plant species.

The special arrangement of intra-ER Ca 2 + buffers, characterized by low affinity for Ca 2 +, in combination with SERCA pump activity keeps intraluminal Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]L) at ∼ 0. 1 – 0. 8 mM (Cell Calcium 38 : 303 – 310, 2005), thus creating a steep electrochemical gradient aimed at the cytosol. Activation of ER Ca 2 + channels results in Ca 2 + release, which contributes to [Ca 2 +]i elevation, whereas SERCA-dependent Ca 2 + uptake assists termination of cytosolic Ca 2 + signals. In addition, the continuous luminal space can act as a travelling route for free Ca 2 + ions (“Ca 2 + tunnels”), thus bypassing cytosolic Ca 2 + buffers and preventing mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake or loss of Ca 2 + over the plasma membrane. Furthermore, changes in [Ca 2 +]L regulate ER-resident chaperones, responsible for postranslational protein processing. Thus, [Ca 2 +]L integrates various signalling events and establishes a link between fast signalling, associated with the ER Ca 2 +release/uptake, and long-lasting adaptive responses relying primarily on the regulation of protein synthesis.

Due to both AChE and BuChE being the main targets of organophosphates, their measurement is widely used as an indication of an exposure to an OP. The main restriction on this type of diagnosis is that depending on the OP the degree to which either AChE or BuChE are inhibited differs; therefore, measure of metabolites in blood and urine do not specify for a certain OP. However, for fast initial screening, determining AChE and BuChE activity in the blood are the most widely used procedures for confirming a diagnosis of OP poisoning.

40|$|Abstract: Painful {{diabetic}} neuropathy {{are common}} and present {{a major challenge}} to the practicing physician. Pain is universal symptom in patients with rare acute sensory neuropathy and is present in only upto 50 % of those patients with the common chronic sensory motor neuropathy. The first step in symptom management is to stabilize glycemic control. There is increasing evidence that blood glucose flux may exacerbate neuropathic pain, so avoiding swings of glycemia from hypoglycemia may help. It is possible that hyperglycemia and its consequent biochemical features may directly cause neuropathic pain. Other theories of the genesis of pain in diabetes include the presence of spontaneous electrical activity in diseased distal axone and also the possibility of ephaptic transmission between efferent autonomic fibers and afferent nociceptive fibers. The approach should be to exclude all non-diabetic causes, remembering that diabetic neuropathy is a diagnosis of exclusion of other potential pathologies. Glycemic control should be assessed particularly looking at A 1 c and blood glucose profiles. All treatments for painful <b>neuropathy</b> <b>target</b> the symptoms rather than the underline pathophysiologic abnormalities. All potential treatments have side effects, and these should be discussed with the patients. First line agents in many centers remain the tricyclic antidepressants, which should be taken at night. Side effect are common; however, the tricyclic agents, specially those with the anticholinergic effect cause symptoms, such as dry mouth and urinary retention.

For studies in vitro, microsomal protein from phenobar-bital-induced livers was isolated from chick embryos and NTE inhibition assays were performed using chick embryo brain ho-mogenate treated with 1 or 5 mM methamidophos (with and without metabolic enzymes); for studies in vivo, hens received 30 to 35 mg/kg methamidophos {{injected into the}} pectoral muscle. NTE aging in hens was assessed 24 h later or after 30 min to 1 h incubation in vitro using solutions of potassium fluoride (KF) reactivator. Technical methamidophos produced {{significantly higher levels of}} aged-inhibited NTE than analytical methami-dophos or isolated optical isomers. In vivo, technical methami...|$|E
40|$|One way to {{minimise}} systemic {{side effects}} of drugs is to design molecules, soft drugs, {{in such a way}} that they are metabolically inactivated rapidly after having acted on their pharmacological <b>target.</b> Hydrolases (<b>esterases,</b> peptidases, lipases, glycosidases, etc.) are enzymes well suited to use for drug inactivation since they are ubiquitously distributed. Insertion of ester bonds susceptible to enzymatic cleavage may represent one approach to make the action of a drug more restricted to the site of application. The present study describes the chemical synthesis of fourteen model compounds comprising a bicyclic aromatic unit connected by an ester-containing bridge to another aromatic ring. Initial attempts to define a) the tissue selectivity of the hydrolytic metabolism and b) the molecular structural factors affecting the rate of enzymatic ester cleavage are presented. The data show that human and rat liver fractions were more active than human duodenal mucosa and human blood leukocytes at a hydrolysing the compounds. The rank order of the compounds was, however, very similar in the different biological systems. Commercially available pig liver carboxyl esterase and cholesterol esterase both reasonably well predict the rank order in the tissue fractions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDifferentiated cells {{retain the}} genetic {{information}} of the donor but {{the extent to}} which phenotypic differences between donors or batches of differentiated cells are explained by variation introduced during the differentiation process is not fully understood. In this study, we evaluated four separate batches of commercially available neurons originating from the same iPSCs to investigate whether the differentiation process used in manufacturing iPSCs to neurons affected genome-wide gene expression and modified cytosines, or neuronal sensitivity to drugs. No significant changes in gene expression, as measured by RNA-Seq, or cytosine modification levels, as measured by the Illumina 450 K arrays, were observed between batches relative to changes over time. As expected, neurotoxic chemotherapeutics affected neuronal outgrowth, but no inter-batch differences were observed in sensitivity to paclitaxel, vincristine and cisplatin. As a testament to the utility of the model for studies of neuropathy, we observed that genes involved in neuropathy had relatively higher expression levels in these samples across different time points. Our results suggest that the process used to differentiate iPSCs into neurons is consistent, resulting in minimal intra-individual variability across batches. Therefore, this model is reasonable for studies of human <b>neuropathy,</b> druggable <b>targets</b> to prevent <b>neuropathy,</b> and other neurological diseases...|$|R
40|$|The {{microbial}} {{degradation of the}} plant cell wall is of increasing industrial significance, exemplified by the interest in generating biofuels from plant cell walls. The majority of plant cell-wall polysaccharides are acetylated, and removal of the acetyl groups through the action of carbohydrate esterases greatly increases the efficiency of polysaccharide saccharification. Enzymes in carbohydrate esterase family 3 (CE 3) are common in plant cell wall-degrading microorganisms {{but there is a}} paucity of structural and biochemical information on these biocatalysts. Clostridium thermocellum contains a single CE 3 enzyme, CtCes 3, which comprises two highly homologous (97 sequence identity) catalytic modules appended to a C-terminal type I dockerin that <b>targets</b> the <b>esterase</b> into the cellulosome, a large protein complex that catalyses plant cell wall degradation. Here, we report the crystal structure and biochemical properties of the N-terminal catalytic module (CtCes 3 - 1) of CtCes 3. The enzyme is a thermostable acetyl-specific esterase that exhibits a strong preference for acetylated xylan. CtCes 3 - 1 displays an Î±/Î² hydrolase fold that contains a central five-stranded parallel twisted Î²-sheet flanked by six Î±-helices. In addition, the enzyme contains a canonical catalytic triad in which Ser 44 is the nucleophile, His 208 is the acid-base and Asp 205 modulates the basic nature of the histidine. The acetate moiety is accommodated in a hydrophobic pocket and the negative charge of the tetrahedral transition state is stabilized through hydrogen bonds with the backbone N of Ser 44 and Gly 95 and the side-chain amide of Asn 124.
