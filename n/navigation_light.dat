25|$|The first <b>navigation</b> <b>light</b> to {{actually}} be installed on Lady Elliot Island was installed two years later, in 1866, {{in connection with the}} guano mining company operating on the island which started in 1863. It was a temporary light installed on a tall mast, which survived until 1871 when it was destroyed by a gale and rebuilt.|$|E
25|$|The stern is {{the back}} or aft-most {{part of a}} ship or boat, {{technically}} defined as the area built up over the sternpost, extending upwards from the counter rail to the taffrail. The stern lies opposite of the bow, the foremost part of a ship. Originally, the term only referred to the aft port section of the ship, but eventually came {{to refer to the}} entire back of a vessel. The stern end of a ship is indicated with a white <b>navigation</b> <b>light</b> at night.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea that}} those aboard Voyager {{incorrectly}} assessed {{their position in}} relation to the carrier was most prominently supported by Robertson during the first commission: he suggested that Stevens and the others aboard the destroyer may have believed that they were on Melbournes port bow. The navigational lights aboard Melbourne may have been dimmed (there is disagreement on this point), and experimental red floodlights on the flight deck may have been seen and misinterpreted as a port-side <b>navigation</b> <b>light.</b> The second Royal Commission felt that this, combined with the ill health of Stevens, was the more likely cause of the collision. Frame states that for this theory to be plausible, the entire bridge crew had to lose the tactical picture at the same time, which he considered to be too improbable. Ferry is also of the opinion that, unless Melbourne was both in Voyagers radar blind spot and obscured by exhaust from the destroyer, it was unlikely that the bridge crew would think they were not to starboard of the carrier.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For the {{environment}} of using the <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> and its requirement, a distributed fault monitoring system on the <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> is designed. The three-layer structure with slave station and master station and Voyage Data Recorder is employed in the system, which can monitor broken wire fault, short circuit fault and power failure on <b>navigation</b> <b>lights.</b> The mature RS 485 communication circuit is adopted in communication interface not only between the master and the slave, but also between the master and VDR (Voyage Data Recorder). The master station gets the information of all <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> from the slave stations, and sends these received data to VDR after being processed. The system has been successfully applied in practice, and can effectively monitor {{the state of the}} <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> and give the alarm information when in fault. In addition, the monitoring system can quickly and accurately trace the fault position and type, so the <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> can be maintain timely...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we {{designed}} and fabricated LED <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> which can replace the existing ones immediately and overcome disadvantages due {{to use of}} conventional lamps. To decide the best arrangement and position of a LED module, optical systems of existing <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> were analyzed and refracted routes of rays were simulated. The electrical and optical characteristics of the fabricated LED <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> were measured and analyzed with a goniophotometer. To calculate ranges of visibility, the vertical and horizontal luminous intensity distributions were evaluated {{in accordance with the}} COLREGs (convention on the international regulation for preventing collisions at Sea). From the results, the proposed LED <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> showed suitable characteristics for marine environment with the power consumption reduced by 90 % and the maximum luminous intensity increased by 20 % compare...|$|R
25|$|Sea-anglers {{and others}} petitioned for the pier to be repaired, but storms on 11 January 1978 and in February 1979 caused {{progressive}} {{collapse of the}} central portion of the pier between the two Bailey bridges, and its remains were dismantled in 1980. The pier head was too solid for demolition, so it remains isolated at sea with its solar-powered <b>navigation</b> <b>light</b> on a pole. From 1989 the Waverley Preservation Society and Medway Queen Preservation Society have shown interest in a future rebuilding of the deep sea pier. The Association of Hotels, Business and Leisure (HBL) has been promoting the rebuilding of a deep-sea pier, and has created and costed its own design. A redevelopment plan for the pier was suggested by Cooperman Vision in 2004 and a feasibility study {{was carried out by}} the Council, but it came to nothing. In 2008 MP Roger Gale suggested that if Canterbury City Council had not refused permission for a casino in Herne Bay, that casino may have helped fund reconstruction of the pier. At the same time, Canterbury City Council was setting up the Herne Bay Pier Trust as a charitable trust to raise £12.5 million to rebuild the pier. As of February 2010, the sports centre was due to be closed in 2011, and on 22 February 2010 the £10,000 Herne Bay Pier Report was published by Canterbury City Council in association with Humberts Leisure, with the suggestion that the Herne Bay Museum and King's Hall sites be sold for redevelopment, to pay for a new build on top of the remaining pier stub. The time limit for public objections was 19 April 2010. The National Piers Society suggested in 2009 that the remaining stub of the pier was at serious risk of demolition or collapse. The sports pavilion was demolished in 2012.|$|E
