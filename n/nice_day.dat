5|$|After {{the release}} of Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!, a {{greatest}} hits record, the duo took a hiatus from the mid-1990s before returning with the albums Have a <b>Nice</b> <b>Day</b> (1999) and Room Service (2001). They continued to chart in other territories, mainly in Europe and Latin America, where they earned various Gold and Platinum awards {{until the beginning of}} the new millennium. In 2002, the duo took a break from recording and touring when Fredriksson was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Gessle went on to release solo albums and reunited with Gyllene Tider before Roxette took to the stage together again {{for the first time in}} 8 years, in 2009, during Gessle's European Party Crasher tour. In 2011, they released Charm School, their first studio album in ten years. This was followed by Travelling a year later.|$|E
5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really <b>nice</b> <b>day</b> one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

This tour, took the band to numerous stages and stadiums throughout the world. The tour was a significant commercial success, as the group played to 2,002,000 fans, and the tour grossed a total $191 million. The tour was the third-highest-grossing tour of 2006 taking in just over $131 million, just behind The Rolling Stones' A Bigger Bang World Tour and Madonna's Confessions Tour. On November 14, 2006, Bon Jovi were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame alongside James Brown and Led Zeppelin.|$|E
25|$|Cactus Jack {{wrestled}} Big Van Vader on April 6, 1993, winning by count-out, {{but being}} severely beaten in the process. As a result, in the rematch with Vader on April 24, the two executed a dangerous spot {{to sell a}} storyline injury. Vader removed the protective mats at ringside and powerbombed Cactus onto the exposed concrete floor, causing a legitimate concussion and causing Foley to temporarily lose sensation in his left foot. While Foley was away, WCW ran an angle where Cactus Jack's absence was explained with a farcical comedy storyline in which he went crazy, was institutionalized, escaped, and developed amnesia. Foley had wanted the injury storyline to be very serious and generate genuine sympathy for him before his return. The comedy vignettes that WCW produced instead were so bad that Foley jokes in Have a <b>Nice</b> <b>Day</b> {{that they were the}} brainchild of WCW executives who regarded a surefire moneymaking feud as a problem that needed to be solved.|$|E

To me, it's much more of a Clint Eastwood 'Have a nice day' than a smiley face 'Have a nice day.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Gessle and Fredriksson reunited in 1998 {{to record}} {{material}} for a new Roxette album, Have a <b>Nice</b> <b>Day,</b> which was released in March 1999 and gave Roxette a comeback in continental Europe. It entered at No.1 in Sweden and No.2 in Germany. The first single, [...] "Wish I Could Fly", became their highest charting UK single since 1993 (No.11). In Sweden it charted at No.4, their best position since [...] "Sleeping in My Car." [...] Although the second single, [...] "Anyone," [...] did not chart well in Europe, [...] "Stars," [...] the third single, charted well in Scandinavian and German speaking countries. NME's review called Have a <b>Nice</b> <b>Day</b> [...] "...another clever-clever bastard of an album which defies Doctor Rock." [...] A review of [...] "I Wish I could Fly" [...] written by Håkan Steen of Aftonbladet said, [...] "The come-back single is a disappointment. The lyrics which conveys a sense of distance in a relationship, are not particularly engaging." [...] The album, according to Billboard magazine, was under discussion for release in the US, but ultimately, it was not released there.|$|E
500|$|Have a <b>nice</b> <b>day</b> is a {{commonly}} spoken expression used to conclude a conversation (whether brief or extensive), or end a message by hoping {{the person to}} whom it is addressed experiences a pleasant day. Since it is often uttered by service employees to customers {{at the end of}} a transaction, particularly in Israel and the United States, its repetitious and dutiful usage has resulted in the phrase developing, according to some journalists and scholars, especially outside of these two countries, a cultural connotation of impersonality, lack of interest, passive–aggressive behavior, or sarcasm. The phrase is generally not used in Europe, as some find it artificial or even offensive. Critics of the phrase characterize it as an imperative, obliging the person to have a <b>nice</b> <b>day.</b> Other critics argue that it is a parting platitude that comes across as pretended. While defenders of the phrase agree that [...] "Have a nice day" [...] can be used insincerely, they consider the phrase to be comforting, in that it improves interactions among people. Others favor the phrase because it does not require a response.|$|E

500|$|J. Broad {{wrote that}} the phrase [...] "have a nice day" [...] is an apt middle ground for the [...] "drop dead" [...] the cashier is {{thinking}} and the [...] "come back soon" [...] the owner wants. Broad stated that the phrase is meaningless {{because it has been}} castrated by excessive usage and pretense. He compared the phrase to the salutation [...] "How are you?" [...] and the phrase [...] "had a lovely time", which are [...] "conversational space-fillers" [...] that help prevent embarrassing silences. Usage of the term has been compared to inserting the phrase [...] "you know" [...] or the word [...] "like" [...] in sentences. In 1982, comedian George Carlin joked at Carnegie Hall, [...] "That's the trouble with 'Have a nice day'; it puts all the pressure on you. Now you've got to go out and somehow manage to have a good time, all because of some loose-lipped cashier. 'Have a <b>nice</b> <b>day</b> ...' Maybe I don't feel like having a <b>nice</b> <b>day.</b> Maybe, just maybe, I've had 116nice days in a row and I'm ready, by God, for a crappy day." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1994 film Forrest Gump, title {{character}} Forrest is jogging {{down the street}} when a T-shirt salesman approaches him, asking him to put his face on T-shirts as inspiration to people. While the men are jogging, a truck splashes mud into Forrest's face, and the salesman gives him a yellow shirt to wipe the mud off. Forrest rolls up the shirt and hands it back, saying [...] "have a nice day". Unrolling the shirt, the man finds a smiley face outlined on it. Thus the film credits Forrest Gump with inventing the Smiley logo and the have a <b>nice</b> <b>day</b> slogan.|$|E

Meanwhile, Roxette signed a US distribution deal with Edel Music, which re-released Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus! In doing so, it replaced some non-US hits with songs from Have a <b>Nice</b> <b>Day.</b> To promote the release the duo did a small tour of America, performing at the Boston Mixfest and at the Virgin Megastore in Times Square. The single [...] "Wish I Could Fly" [...] included in the album reached No.27 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart and No.40 on the Adult Top 40 tally.|$|E

500|$|Carol Swiderski of the Chicago Tribune {{wrote that}} {{although}} saying [...] "have a nice day" [...] {{may not be}} sincere, the speaker has acknowledged that the recipient is there.

[...] Writing that society has become so automated that going through a check-out line at a grocery store without having made eye contact or spoken with the checker is possible, Swiderski favored [...] "insincerely meant human kindness to a robot". She encouraged people to respond to [...] "have a nice day" [...] with [...] "you have a <b>nice</b> <b>day,</b> too" [...] because she hoped that when {{a sufficient number of}} people do this, there could be a time when people will sincerely intend it.|$|E

[...] Brown recalled [...] "It was a <b>nice</b> <b>day,</b> and a nice wicket. O'Reilly came in, and I told him I'd take the quicks—Wellard and Farnes—and Tiger [...] took Verity."

Additionally, the Senegalese {{musician}} Youssou N'Dour recorded an unusual cover {{version of the}} song, in which he treated the song as an anthem for the many people in Africa struggling to survive. The melody of [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] was deliberately borrowed by Billy Bragg for the song [...] "Ideology", from his third album, Talking with the Taxman about Poetry, with Bragg's chorus [...] "above the sound of ideologies clashing" [...] echoing Dylan's [...] "we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing". In addition, the Bon Jovi song [...] "Bells of Freedom", from their Have a <b>Nice</b> <b>Day</b> album, is somewhat reminiscent of [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] in structure. Neil Young's song [...] "Flags of Freedom" [...] from his Living with War album mentions Dylan by name and melodically recalls the tune and verse structure of [...] "Chimes of Freedom", though Young is listed as the song's only writer.

500|$|Jan C. Snow laments {{that the}} phrase was trite and {{indicative}} of the speaker's lack of vocabulary. She wrote that on Saturdays, people could be asked to [...] "have a relaxing day". People with highly variable jobs such as emergency room nurses may appreciate [...] "have a routine day", while mothers of young children may wish to [...] "have a quiet day". Debbie Lundberg wrote in her 2008book Have a <b>Nice</b> <b>Day</b> Is Not Thank You, and No Problem Is Not You're Welcome that service people should say [...] "thank you" [...] instead of [...] "have a nice day". She argued that [...] "thank you" [...] is shorter and is a [...] "recognition of the ability you have to thank someone", which adds more worth to the purchase than something that will occur in the future. Paul V. Marshall, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Bethlehem, concurred, writing in the Reading Eagle that he prefers [...] "thank you" [...] to [...] "have a nice day" [...] or [...] "have a great day" [...] even though [...] "thank you" [...] has a [...] "host of socially acceptable responses". He stated that when people say [...] "thank you", they admit that they are dependent on others, {{which leads to a}} healthier, safer society.|$|E
500|$|Kyle, Cartman, Stan, [...] and Kenny enjoy a <b>nice</b> <b>day</b> {{outside with}} the weather being warm until {{a large group of}} Harley riders disturb them. The {{residents}} of South Park are frustrated by a large group of Harley riders frequently making noise in town. The Harley riders eat lunch and talk about how nobody is paying attention to them, so one of the Harley riders comes up with a noise to get everyone's attention. Before the Harley riders take off, Cartman confronts the bikers, describing them as insecure losers who ride loud motorcycles to draw attention to themselves. Cartman tells them their behavior makes them look like [...] "fags" [...] and, when other children begin referring to the bikers with the same slur, the bikers assume they are being insulted because they are not being loud enough. They believe that they should be louder because after all, children are around loud stuff today (such as the Xbox 360 and Surround sound system). The motorcyclists equip their motorcycles with horns, sirens and various musical instruments. The boys devise a plan to rid the town of the bikers. However, once Butters reveals that he likes Harley motorcycles, he is not allowed to participate in the scheme. As the riders eat at a diner, Cartman defecates on the seats of their motorcycles while Kyle and Stan spray paint [...] "FAGS GET OUT" [...] on several buildings around town. The boys are pleased when the bikers temporarily leave town, but the graffiti alarms Big Gay Al and Mr. Slave because they interpret it as homophobia.|$|E
500|$|Brown's {{most celebrated}} innings {{came in the}} Second Test at Lord's, {{carrying}} his bat to score 206 in the first televised Test match. England batted first and amassed 494, largely {{on the back of}} Wally Hammond's 240. Brown featured in an opening stand of 69 before Fingleton was dismissed. Hedley Verity then bowled Bradman for 18, leaving the score at 101, before Stan McCabe fell after a quickfire 38 with the score at 3/152. Brown registered his century in 193 minutes, during an innings highlighted by his driving {{on both sides of the}} wicket. After Lindsay Hassett was dismissed for 56 following a 134-run partnership, Australia reached stumps at 5/299, with Brown on 140. The following day, Brown set about ensuring that Australia would avoid the follow on, featuring in an aggressive eighth-wicket stand with tailender Bill O'Reilly. The pair added 85 runs in just 46 minutes, with Brown recalling [...] "It was a <b>nice</b> <b>day,</b> and a nice wicket. O'Reilly came in, and I told him I'd take the quicks—Wellard and Farnes—and Tiger [...] took Verity." [...] Brown continued past his double century and remained unbeaten on 206 from just 375 minutes when his last partner fell, leaving Australia all out for 422. Brown's innings was the 100th century by an Australian against England, and the highest Test score for batsman carrying his bat; it stood until Glenn Turner made an unbeaten 223 in 1972. Ray Robinson quipped that Brown's performance [...] "did not cause smoke to rise from the back of those [...] sets but the charm of his style gave viewers a favourable impression of Australian batsmanship". They went on to draw the match, which was crucial in Australia's eventual retention of the Ashes. Brown's uninterrupted batting meant that he was on the field from the first morning until late on the fourth day.|$|E
