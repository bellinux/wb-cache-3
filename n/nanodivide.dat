40|$|The paper {{discusses}} in {{the context}} of nanotechnology whether current concepts of chemical risk assessment can be used to assess nanorisk. Nanorisk can be defined from the narrow (eco) toxicological perspective to the broader sense to include societal/cultural impacts or even to the fundamental philosophical level i. e. questioning societies need for the technology. We outline here the limitations of chemical risk assessment and other recent proposed risk governance paradigms in relation to nanotechnology and nanomaterials, including, its inability to include societal risks (ownership, privacy, security, <b>nanodivide</b> 1, convergence of nano-, bio-, etc.) and metaphysical risk (including the lay persons perspective on the risks of nanotechnology). Finally, we outline the fundamental principles and criteria that an alternative comprehensive framework should be based on...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe direct {{electrochemical}} {{conversion of}} chemical energy in low-temperature fuel cells is underpinned by {{the activity of}} the catalytic center. The latter, in <b>nanodivided</b> form (either precious or non-precious), is also influenced by the effect of the support, which serves as electron conductor. Herein, we discuss the relevant physicochemical driving force that leads to a "strong interaction" with substrates of carbon and oxide nature. Due to the interest in the activity and stability, special attention is given to the cathodic process, that is, to the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Se K-edge XAFS spectra were {{collected}} for various model compounds of Se {{as well as}} for 3 biofilm samples from bioreactors used for Se-contaminated wastewater treatment. In the biofilm samples, Se is dominantly as Se(0) despite Se K-edge XANES spectroscopy cannot easily distinguish between elemental Se and Se(-I) -bearing selenides. EXAFS spectra indicate that Se is located within aperiodic domains, markedly different to these known in monoclinc red selenium. However, Se can well occur within <b>nanodivided</b> domains related to monoclinic red Se, as this form was optically observed at the rim of some sludges. Aqueous selenate is then efficiently bioreduced, under sulfate reducing and methanogenic conditions...|$|R
