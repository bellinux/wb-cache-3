Provitamin A carotenoids in fruit and vegetables are {{the major source of}} vitamin A for {{a large proportion of the}} world’s population. However, the contribution of plant foods is substantial only when both the consumption and provitamin A content of such food is high and, at the same time, the bioefficacy of the provitamin A is high. With respect to provitamin A carotenoids, the term bioefficacy is defined as the product of the fraction of the ingested amount that is absorbed (bioavailability) and the fraction of that which is converted to retinol in the body (bioconversion). <b>Isotopic</b> <b>tracer</b> techniques can meet the need for accurate and pre-cise estimates of the bioavailability, bioconversion, and bioeffi-cacy of dietary carotenoids in humans.

5000|$|Tracer {{diffusion}} and Self-diffusion, {{which is}} a spontaneous mixing of molecules {{taking place in the}} absence of concentration (or chemical potential) gradient. This type of diffusion can be followed using <b>isotopic</b> <b>tracers,</b> hence the name. The tracer diffusion is usually assumed to be identical to self-diffusion (assuming no significant isotopic effect). This diffusion can take place under equilibrium. An excellent method for the measurement of self-diffusion coefficients is pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR, where no <b>isotopic</b> <b>tracers</b> are needed. In a so-called NMR spin echo experiment this technique uses the nuclear spin precession phase, allowing to distinguish chemically and physically completely identical species e.g. in the liquid phase, as for example water molecules within liquid water. The self-diffusion coefficient of water has been experimentally determined with high accuracy and thus serves often as a reference value for measurements on other liquids. The self-diffusion coefficient of neat water is: 2.299·10−9 m²·s−1 at 25 °C and 1.261·10−9 m²·s−1 at 4 °C.|$|R

Three snowmelt events and one storm event during the winter and spring of 1984 were studied at an instrumented watershed in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. Conditions for use of the <b>isotopic</b> <b>tracer</b> were not always met, however. During {{the latter part of the}} snowmelt and the storm the isotopic content of the groundwater and event water were not distinguishable. Furthermore, the isotopic content of the meltwa-ter varied considerably over time, thereby reducing the precision of the hydrograph separation. Frequent sampling of the meltwater is mandatory to assess this variability. Because the concentration of major cations and anions was measured as well, chemical tracers could be compared to the <b>isotopic</b> <b>tracer,</b> when the <b>isotopic</b> hydrograph separation was reliable, to test whether the chemical tracer was conserva-tive.

40|$|ABSTRACT Whole-body copper {{metabolism}} {{is difficult}} to study in human subjects. However, the use of <b>isotopic</b> <b>tracers</b> and kinetics modeling has added a dimension beyond what can be learned in humans by direct measurement. Mechanisms regulat-ing total body copper seem to be strong, given the relatively small and constant body pool, {{but they are not}} yet well under-stood. The efficiency of copper absorption varies greatly, depending on dietary intake. Changes in efficiency of absorption help to regulate the amount of copper retained by the body. In addition, endogenous excretion of copper into the gastrointesti-nal tract depends heavily on the amount of copper absorbed. When dietary copper is high and more is absorbed, endogenous excretion increases, protecting against excess accumulation of copper in the body. When intake is low, little endogenous copper is excreted, protecting against copper depletion. Regulation is not sufficient with very low amounts of dietary copper (0. 38 mg/d) and appears to be delayed when copper intake is high. The use of <b>isotopic</b> <b>tracers</b> and kinetic modeling should aid in eluci-dating the regulatory mechanisms. Am J Clin Nut...|$|R

We evaluated whether an index of antilipolytic insulin action could be derived from readily available insulin and glycerol concentrations obtained during clamps or oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT). We evaluated data collected from 29 subjects who had undergone a 3 -stage hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (4, 8, and 40 mU/m 2 /min) with infusion of [2 H 5]glycerol to calculate the glycerol rate of appearance (GLYRA). Exponential decay curves for GLYRA across insulin concentrations were generated for each individual and suppression of lipolysis was calculated as the insulin concentration needed to half-maximally suppress GLYRA (GLYRA EC 50). Areas under the curve for glycerol (GLYAUC) and insulin (INSAUC) were calculated and their products (INSAUC×GLYAUC) were calculated as an index of insulin suppression of lipolysis. The clamp index was highly correlated with GLYRA EC 50 (r = 0. 862, p< 0. 001), as was an OGTT-derived index (r = 0. 720, p< 0. 01).
