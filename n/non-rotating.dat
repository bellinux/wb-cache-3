5|$|The Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, {{provided}} a comprehensive coverage of Jupiter's magnetic field near the equatorial plane at distances up to 100RJ. The regions studied included the magnetotail and the dawn and dusk {{sectors of the}} magnetosphere. While Galileo successfully survived in the harsh radiation environment of Jupiter, it still experienced a few technical problems. In particular, the spacecraft's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors. Several times electrical arcs occurred between rotating and <b>non-rotating</b> parts of the spacecraft, causing it to enter safe mode, which led to total loss of {{the data from the}} 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileo's ultra-stable quartz oscillator.|$|E
5|$|These {{computations}} all {{assume that}} the white dwarf is <b>non-rotating.</b> If the white dwarf is rotating, the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium must be modified {{to take into account}} the centrifugal pseudo-force arising from working in a rotating frame. For a uniformly rotating white dwarf, the limiting mass increases only slightly. If the star is allowed to rotate nonuniformly, and viscosity is neglected, then, as was pointed out by Fred Hoyle in 1947, there is no limit to the mass for which it is possible for a model white dwarf to be in static equilibrium. Not all of these model stars will be dynamically stable.|$|E
5|$|A priori, it is {{not clear}} whether the new local frames in free fall {{coincide}} with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold—that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. below). The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity. The generalization of this statement, namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and <b>non-rotating)</b> reference frames, is known as the Einstein equivalence principle, a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.|$|E

5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and <b>non-rotating</b> frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major issue}} {{is the amount of}} {{radiation}} to which a space probe is subjected, due to the harsh charged-particle environment around Jupiter (for a detailed explanation see Magnetosphere of Jupiter). For example, when Pioneer 11 made its closest approach to the planet, the level of radiation was ten times more powerful than Pioneers designers had predicted, leading to fears that the probes would not survive. With a few minor glitches, the probe managed to pass through the radiation belts, but it lost most of the images of the moon Io, as the radiation had caused Pioneers imaging photo polarimeter to receive false commands. The subsequent and far more technologically advanced Voyager spacecraft had to be redesigned to cope with the radiation levels. Over the eight years the Galileo spacecraft orbited the planet, the probe's radiation dose far exceeded its design specifications, and its systems failed on several occasions. The spacecraft's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors, and electrical arcs sometimes occurred between its rotating and <b>non-rotating</b> parts, causing it to enter safe mode, which led to total loss of the data from the 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileos ultra-stable quartz oscillator.|$|E
25|$|The Schwarzschild solution, which {{describes}} spacetime surrounding a spherically symmetric <b>non-rotating</b> uncharged massive object. For compact enough objects, this solution generated {{a black hole}} with a central singularity.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} visual feedback in adapting to novel visuomotor environments. Participants produced isometric elbow torques to move a cursor towards visual targets. Following trials with no rotation, participants adapted to a 60 ° rotation of the visual feedback {{before returning to the}} <b>non-rotated</b> condition. Participants received continuous visual feedback (CF) of cursor position during task execution or post-trial visual feedback (PF). With training, reductions of the angular deviations of the cursor path occurred to a similar extent and at a similar rate for CF and PF groups. However, upon re-exposure to the <b>non-rotated</b> environment only CF participants exhibited post-training aftereffects, manifested as increased angular deviation of the cursor path, with respect to the pre-rotation trials. These aftereffects occurred despite colour cues permitting identification of the change in environment. The results show that concurrent feedback permits automatic recalibration of the visuomotor mapping while post-trial feedback permits performance improvement via a cognitive strategy...|$|R
50|$|The above {{description}} applies also to a rectangular, <b>non-rotated</b> image {{which might}} be, for example, overlaid on an orthogonally projected map. If the world file describes {{an image that}} is rotated from the axis of the target projection, however, then A, D, B and E must be derived from the required affine transformation (see below). Specifically, A and E {{will no longer be}} the meter/pixel measurement on their respective axes.|$|R
25|$|In the 1980s, Johan Brögger {{modified}} the Boehm flute by fixing two major problems that had existed for nearly 150 years: maladjustment between certain keys and problems between the G and B keys. The result was <b>non-rotating</b> shafts, which gave a quieter sound and less friction on moving parts. Also, the modifications allowed for springs {{to be adjusted}} individually, and the flute was strengthened. The Brögger flute is only made by the Brannen Brothers and Miyazawa Flutes.|$|E
25|$|The Jarmann M1884 fired a 10.15mm {{black powder}} {{cartridge}} in an 8-round, tubular magazine {{in which the}} rounds were lined up in a tube below the barrel. It has a <b>non-rotating</b> bolt (the part of the action that seals the rear end of the barrel) locked by a rotating bolt handle, and reputedly a smooth action. However, this action is not considered strong enough to fire modern ammunition, since the only locking {{is provided by the}} rotating bolt handle.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} the Coriolis force on {{ballistic}} trajectories {{should not be confused}} with the curvature of the paths of missiles, satellites, and similar objects when the paths are plotted on two-dimensional (flat) maps, such as the Mercator projection. The projections of the three-dimensional curved surface of the Earth to a two-dimensional surface (the map) necessarily results in distorted features. The apparent curvature of the path is a consequence of the sphericity of the Earth and would occur even in a <b>non-rotating</b> frame.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDifficulties in left–right {{discrimination}} (LRD) {{are commonly}} experienced {{in everyday life}} situations. Here we investigate the neurocognitive mechanisms of LRD and the specific role of left angular gyrus. Given that previous behavioral research reported women to be more susceptible to left–right confusion, the current study focuses particularly on the neural basis of sex differences in LRD while controlling for potential menstrual cycle effects (repeated measures design). 16 women and 15 men were presented pictures of pointing hands in various orientations (rotated versus <b>non-rotated)</b> {{and were asked to}} identify them as left or right hands. Results revealed that LRD was particularly associated with activation in inferior parietal regions, extending into the right angular gyrus. Irrespective of menstrual cycle phase, women, relative to men, recruited more prefrontal areas, suggesting higher top-down control in LRD. For the subset of rotated stimuli as compared to the <b>non-rotated,</b> we found leftward asymmetry for both men and women, although women scored significantly lower. We conclude that there are sex differences in the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying LRD. Although the angular gyrus is involved in LRD, several other parietal areas are at least as critical. Moreover, the hypothesis that more left–right confusion is due to more bilateral activation (in women) can be rejected...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new universal, measurement-based model of quantum computation, which is potentially attractive for implementation on ion trap and superconducting qubit devices. It differs from the traditional one-way model in two ways: (1) the resource states which {{play the role of}} graph states are prepared via 2 -qubit Mølmer-Sørensen interactions and (2) the model only requires <b>non-rotated</b> Pauli X and Z measurements to obtain universality. We exploit the fact that the relevant resource states and measurements have a simple representation in the ZX-calculus to give a short, graphical proof of universality. Comment: 15 page...|$|R
25|$|Due to data {{transmission}} problems, structural health monitoring of wind turbines is usually performed using several accelerometers and strain gages {{attached to the}} nacelle to monitor the gearbox and equipments. Currently, digital image correlation and stereophotogrammetry are used to measure dynamics of wind turbine blades. These methods usually measure displacement and strain to identify location of defects. Dynamic characteristics of <b>non-rotating</b> wind turbines have been measured using digital image correlation and photogrammetry. Three dimensional point tracking has also been used to measure rotating dynamics of wind turbines.|$|E
25|$|If {{one looks}} at this train from the fixed <b>non-rotating</b> frame {{on top of the}} center of the Earth, at that speed it remains {{stationary}} as the Earth spins beneath it. Hence, the only force acting on it is gravity and the reaction from the track. This force is greater (by 0.34%) than the force that the passengers and the train experience when at rest (rotating along with Earth). This difference is what the Coriolis effect accounts for in the rotating frame of reference.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the theory}} of relativity, due to their {{constant}} movement and height relative to the Earth-centered, <b>non-rotating</b> approximately inertial reference frame, the clocks on the satellites are affected by their speed. Special relativity predicts that the frequency of the atomic clocks moving at GPS orbital speeds will tick more slowly than stationary ground clocks by a factor of , or result in a delay of about 7 μs/day, where the orbital velocity is v = 4km/s, and c = the speed of light. The time dilation effect has been measured and verified using the GPS.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} visual feedback of task performance in visuomotor adaptation. Participants produced novel {{two degrees of freedom}} movements (elbow flexion-extension, forearm pronation-supination) to move a cursor towards visual targets. Following trials with no rotation, participants were exposed to a 60 A degrees visuomotor rotation, before returning to the <b>non-rotated</b> condition. A colour cue on each trial permitted identification of the rotated/non-rotated contexts. Participants could not see their arm but received continuous and concurrent visual feedback (CF) of a cursor representing limb position or post-trial visual feedback (PF) representing the movement trajectory. Separate groups of participants who received CF were instructed that online modifications of their movements either were, or were not, permissible as a means of improving performance. Feedforward-mediated performance improvements occurred for both CF and PF groups in the rotated environment. Furthermore, for CF participants this adaptation occurred regardless of whether feedback modifications of motor commands were permissible. Upon re-exposure to the <b>non-rotated</b> environment participants in the CF, but not PF, groups exhibited post-training aftereffects, manifested as greater angular deviations from a straight initial trajectory, with respect to the pre-rotation trials. Accordingly, the nature of the performance improvements that occurred was dependent upon the timing of the visual feedback of task performance. Continuous visual feedback of task performance during task execution appears critical in realising automatic visuomotor adaptation through a recalibration of the visuomotor mapping that transforms visual inputs into appropriate motor commands. ...|$|R
50|$|Except for {{absolute}} centre marking for {{cubes of}} odd size, numerical marking {{would provide the}} best means of centre cubie marking for hardware cubes as their size range is limited. Rotation of the numbers would mean a small inconvenience relative to <b>non-rotated</b> numbers {{that can be used}} for software cubes. The big advantage of numbers is that they reduce the complexity of solving the last cube face when markings are in use (e.g. if the set-of-four sequence is 1-3-4-2 (even parity, needs two swaps to become the required 1-2-3-4) then the algorithm requirement is clear. Algorithms have been defined in and are, of course, equally applicable to hardware cubes.|$|R
40|$|Pharmacological {{manipulations}} which {{result in}} abnormal levels of excitatory amino acid (EAA) mediated neurotransmission {{can result in}} neuronal apoptosis. We accordingly hypothesised that manipulations of the external environment which induce prolonged EAA-mediated transmission in sensory neurons may also induce apoptosis. This hypothesis was tested by placing groups of adult mice, housed in their home cage, on a turntable which slowly rotated (0. 8 rev. /min). This non-invasive manipulation will have resulted in abnormal discharge patterns in the vestibular nuclei. Significantly greater levels of neuronal apoptosis were seen in the vestibular complex after rotation for 48 h compared with <b>non-rotated</b> controls. This finding was also predicted independently from a computational approach...|$|R
25|$|The Viennese Waltz is a rotary dance {{where the}} dancers are {{constantly}} turning {{either in a}} clockwise (natural) or anti-clockwise (reverse) direction interspersed with <b>non-rotating</b> change steps to switch between the direction of rotation. A true Viennese waltz consists only of turns and change steps. Other moves such as the fleckerls, American-style figures and side sway or underarm turns are modern inventions and are not normally danced at the annual balls in Vienna. Furthermore, in a properly danced Viennese Waltz, couples do not pass, but turn continuously left and right while travelling counterclockwise around the floor following each other.|$|E

Some of the Bureau's activities were the <b>non-rotating</b> proximity fuze, guided missile developments (see the Bat), establishment of a Radio Propagation Laboratory, critical materials research on optical glass which Germany had previously supplied, on quartz and synthetic rubber and measurement and calibration services.

25|$|In {{creating}} the wormhole and a supermassive rotating black hole (which possesses an ergosphere, {{as opposed to}} a <b>non-rotating</b> black hole), Thorne collaborated with visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin and a team of 30 people at Double Negative. Thorne would provide pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the engineers, who then wrote new CGI rendering software based on these equations to create accurate computer simulations of the gravitational lensing caused by these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, totalling to 800 terabytes of data for the movie. The resulting visual effect provided Thorne with new insight into the effects of gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, which led to the publication of three scientific papers.|$|E
5000|$|A {{disadvantage}} of WED is its incapability {{to do anything}} without blocks or terrain. E.g. it is really hard to build a street (that {{is not just a}} plane), because it is nearly impossible to move the blocks in the perfect position, so no [...] "steps" [...] or gaps are in the street (it is just not possible to get the edges of the blocks perfectly together, the snap-to-grid-feature helps only when using nearly <b>non-rotated</b> blocks). Triangles or a snap-block-edge-to-block-edge feature would fix that and would make it possible to make a more complex floor out of more than one single block without gaps or steps.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{particle}} accelerator designs demand for advanced prediction of parasitic effects like wake fields, even in structures of comparatively weak influence like tapers. In {{the case of}} smoothly tapered components even well estab-lished codes like MAFIA [1] demonstrate strong discretiza-tion dependency of the results or solver instabilities, mak-ing alternative approaches necessary for such applications. Grid dispersion is assumed to cause these problems. In Ref. [2] an alternative discretization scheme is described, using a homogeneous rotated mesh intended to eliminate such grid dispersion effects. In order to study the depen-dence on the discretization applied, we use this scheme to calculate wake fields in prototype taper structures of rota-tional symmetry. Furthermore a comparison is provided with results of a <b>non-rotated</b> mesh, MAFIA runs and- so far applicable- analytical approaches...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{experimental}} results of long wave run-up climbing up a 1 : 40 sloping beach. The resulting maximum run-up is compared with analytical results {{and a good}} agreement is found for single sinusoidal waves with uniform wave period and varying amplitude.

The reduction in wave run-up is expressed {{by means of a}} nomogram relating the wave run-up without macro-roughness elements present to those cases where on-land flow is modified by macro-roughness. The presented results mainly focus on a non-staggered and <b>non-rotated</b> macro-roughness configuration. In addition to the run-up reduction, surface elevation profiles on the shore are presented, that address the shock wave generation when the wave tongue approaches the first row of macro-roughness elements...|$|R
500|$|The {{time until}} Betelgeuse explodes {{depends on the}} {{predicted}} initial conditions and on the estimate of the time already spent as a red supergiant. [...] The total lifetime {{from the start of}} the red supergiant phase to core collapse varies from about 300,000 years for a rotating [...] star, 550,000 years for a rotating [...] star, and up to a million years for a <b>non-rotating</b> [...] star.

40|$|We find a {{realization}} of the Z_ 2 -symmetry in the neutrino mass matrix which expresses a rotation of the μ-τ symmetry {{and is able to}} impose a generic smallest mixing angle, in contrast to a zero-value predicted by the usual <b>non-rotated</b> form of the μ-τ symmetry. We extend this symmetry for the lepton sector within type-I seesaw scenario, and show it can accommodate the mixing angles, the mass hierarchies and the lepton asymmetry in the universe. We then study the effects of perturbing the specific form of the neutrino mass matrix imposed by the symmetry and compute the resulting mixing and mass spectrum. We trace back this "low-scale" perturbation to a "high-scale" perturbation, and find realizations of this latter one arising from exact symmetries with an enriched matter content.

40|$|SummaryRibosome {{dynamics}} play {{an important}} role in translation. The rotation of the ribosomal subunits relative to one another is essential for tRNA-mRNA translocation. An important unresolved question is whether subunit rotation limits the rate of translocation. Here, we monitor subunit rotation relative to peptide bond formation and translocation using ensemble kinetics and single-molecule FRET. We observe that spontaneous forward subunit rotation occurs at a rate of 40  s− 1, independent of the rate of preceding peptide bond formation. Elongation factor G (EF-G) accelerates forward subunit rotation to 200 s− 1. tRNA-mRNA movement is much slower (10 – 40 s− 1), suggesting that forward subunit rotation does not limit the rate of translocation. The transition back to the <b>non-rotated</b> state of the ribosome kinetically coincides with tRNA-mRNA movement. Thus, large-scale movements of the ribosome are intrinsically rapid and gated by its ligands such as EF-G and tRNA...|$|R
