30|$|The order Hemiptera {{were the}} most {{dominant}} and widespread representing 7 families. The 7 families were over-represented by Family Velidae and Genus Rhagovelia. Other predators of mosquito larvae belonged to the Order Odonata (which recorded 3 families dominated by family Coenagrionidae) and Order Coleoptera (which recorded 2 families dominated by Dytiscidae). The Hemipterans are regarded as effective predators of freshwater snails and mosquito larvae (Ohba and Nakasuji 2006). It is also well known that notonectids are voracious predators of mosquito larvae. Gilbert and Burns (1999) concluded that <b>notonectid</b> predators {{have the potential to}} alter mosquito communities via direct or indirect effects. Direct evidence of <b>notonectid</b> predation on mosquito larvae was later noted and this further confirmed their predominant role in mosquito larvae control (Chesson 1984).|$|E
40|$|Abstract Notonectids {{are widely}} {{distributed}} in freshwaters and can prey on zooplankton in temperate lakes. However, {{its role in}} structuring the zooplankton community is unknown in tropical lakes. Thus, our objective was to study the <b>notonectid</b> Martarega uruguayensis in a Brazilian tropical shallow lake to evaluate its potential as a zooplankton predator. Its horizontal distribution was analized in the lake throughout one year in fortnightly samplings. Backswimmers were more abundant (mean density 162. 9 ± 25. 8 ind. m– 2) in the cool-dry season, with a strong preference by the littoral zone (mean density 139. 9 ± 17. 5 ind. m– 2). Laboratory experiments were undertaken with young and adult <b>notonectid</b> and the two most abundant cladocerans, Daphnia gessneri and Ceriodaphnia richardi, as prey. Predation by backswimmers in the laboratory showed that only juveniles fed on microcrustaceans (mean ingestion rate of 1. 2 ± 0. 2 Daphnia and 1. 0 ± 0. 2 Ceriodaphnia per predator per hour), without size selectivity. Adult insects probably have difficulties in detecting and manipulating small planktonic organisms. On the other hand, young instars might influence zooplankton community, especially in the littoral zone of the lake. This study does contribute {{to a better understanding}} of trophic interactions in tropical shallow lakes and is the first to investigate the predation of a <b>notonectid</b> on microcrustaceans from Lake Monte Alegre...|$|E
40|$|Temperature, turbulence, oxygen, and <b>notonectid</b> predators (Anisops calcaratus) {{were studied}} {{experimentally}} as possible factors influencing crest growth in six {{different forms of}} the Daphnia carinata complex. Predators were the most potent influence, inducing crest development {{in four of the}} morphs. Temperature had only a secondary effect which may have been indirect. When the notonectids were partitioned off from the Daphnia in the same container, crest development still resulted, suggesting that the stimulus was a water-soluble secretion from the predator. If the notonectids were starved this secretion was either not produced or was ineffective. Experiments showed that predators could induce crest devel-opment in adult daphnids that were initially uncrested and that a sustained stimulus from the predator was necessary if crested juvenile Daphnia were to produce crested adults. Under experimental conditions, daphnids with a crest were less susceptible to <b>notonectid</b> predation (mainly because of superior evasion powers) than were those without one. Results of a regres-sion analysis of field data were broadly consistent with experimental results, especially in indicating that predation was a potent factor influencing crest development, and the distri...|$|E
30|$|The {{temperature}} {{recorded in}} the current study ranged between 18.0 °C and 26.3 °C, thus can be described as warm and are likely to support most of the predators especially the <b>notonectids.</b> Earlier studies showed that thermal conditions are especially important in predator–prey survival among aquatic organisms (Bailey 1989, Thomson 1978), especially those that are involved in size-dependent predation (Formanowicz 1986, Travis et al. 1985). However, while much research quantified in the physiological effects of temperature on specific organisms, few studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of temperature on species interactions and their adaptive capacity to those ranges in field conditions.|$|R

Field tests were conducted in Kilifi District, Kenya on field populations of damselfly nymph (Gomphilidae), dragonfly nymph (Coenagrionidae), macro-dytiscids, micro-dytiscids (Dystiscidae), <b>notonectids</b> (Notonectidae), freshwater shrimps (Palaemonidae), tadpoles (Ranidae) and tilapia fish (Cichlidae). Artifical habitats were sampled and populations determined before and after application of the plant powder. Four doses (8. 571, 5. 714, 2. 875 and 1. 429 g L - 1), {{were used in the}} trials and mortalities monitored after 24, 48 and 72 h. After 24 h, at 1. 429 g L - 1 of the powder from P. guineense and S. mauritiana, less than 20 % mortality was obtained against gomphilids, coenagrionids, dytiscids, <b>notonectids</b> and palaemonids. At 48 h, powder of P. guineense gave 8. 8 and 45 % mortality against micro-dytiscids and tadpoles at 8. 571 g L - 1, respectively. After 72 h, at 2. 847 g L - 1, powder of S. mauritiana caused 6. 9 and 35 % mortality against micro-dytiscids and fish, respectively.

40|$|Temporary pools are {{traditionally}} considered as refuges where the conspicuous anostracans are protected from predation. While {{this is true}} for the size-selective predation by fish, there is compelling evidence that invertebrate predation is an important biotic stress regulating temporary pool communities. In rock pools in southeastern Botswana, we studied the impact of some suspected invertebrate predators on populations of the freshwater anostracan Branchipodopsis wolfi by means of observations and manipulative experiments. In a survey of 45 pools, the relationship between B. wolfi natural population sizes and the abundance of suspected predators were never negative for turbellarians and mosquito larvae. When dragonfly larvae, <b>notonectids</b> or tadpoles were present, the anostracan populations were generally non-existent or very small. In enclosure experiments with turbellarians, there was a significant effect of predation within one hour of the start; the average daily predation rate was about 1 / 4 anostracan per turbellarian. Anostracans from a pool with few turbellarians were slightly less vulnerable than those from a turbellarian-rich pool. Furthermore, there was an indication of males being predated on more than females. With dragonfly larvae and <b>notonectids,</b> the predation effect was marked with all six anostracans in an experiment eaten in less than one day by a single predator (predation rate: about one anostracan every 2 h per predator). In a behavioral study, both sexes of B. wolfi avoided swimming above sediment that held more turbellarians than the open patches; there was no evidence for chemical communication with respect to this behavior. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Very few {{parasite}} {{species are}} directly predated {{but most of}} them inherit the predators of their host. We explored the behavioural response of nematomorph hairworms when their hosts are preyed upon by one of the commonest invertebrate predators in the aquatic habitat of hairworms, notonectids. The hairworm Paragordius tricuspidatus can alter the behaviour of its terrestrial insect host (the cricket Nemobius sylvestris), causing it to jump into the water; an aquatic habitat is required for the adult free-living stage of the parasite. We predicted that hairworms whose hosts are captured by a <b>notonectid</b> should accelerate their emergence to leave the host before being killed. As predicted, the emergence length of the worm was significantly shortened in cases of <b>notonectid</b> predation, but the exact reason of this response seems to be more complex than expected. Indeed, experimental manipulations revealed that hairworms are remarkably insensitive to a prolonged exposure to predator effluvia which notonectids inject into prey, so accelerated emergence is not a protective response against digestive enzymes. We discuss other possibilities for the accelerated exit observed, ranging from unspecific stress responses to other scenarios requiring consideration of the ecological context. 4 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{floodplains}} occasionally comprise highly productive zooplankton communities {{which are}} exposed to rapid shifts in predator regimes, also between vertebrate and invertebrate predators. We recorded the impact of two co-occurring zooplankton predators, the <b>notonectid</b> Anisops sardea Ceriodaphnia reticulata (0. 25 – 0. 78 mm), Daphnia laevis and 0 + fish fry of Tilapia rendalli  (max gape size 1 mm), on a cladoceran community dominated by (0. 6 – 1. 8 mm) and Scapholeberis kingi  (0. 27 – 0. 8 mm). Both predators strongly reduced abundance of all prey species, yet with a striking size-selective effect for Daphnia prey only, where fish showed a strong preference for small individuals, while Anisops preferred large Daphnia individuals. This contrasts with the general view of size selection in invertebrate  versus  vertebrate predators, but is logically caused by the feeding mode of the <b>notonectid,</b> and the gape size limitation of the fish fry. The two predators also showed a dietary niche differentiation {{in terms of both}} prey selection and habitat choice. T. rendalli fed preferably on small species and size classes, whereas predation from A. sardea concentrated on large prey. Competitive interference was indicated when feeding on Ceriodaphnia, and niche partitioning when feeding on the two other species. The predatory pattern suggests long-lasting coexistence in the system. </strong...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{freshwater}} cladocerans Daphnia pulex and Daphnia schodleri {{protect themselves}} from predation by morphological alterations induced in response to water-soluble chemicals released by their respective predators.

The method we used was {{justified by the}} fact that the seasonal trend of larvae coincided very well with the trend of adults. The seasonal abundance of larvae was different in years but generally lower in summer. It was shown that the important factors influencing the abundance include (1) drying up of pools by direct sunshine and little rain fall, (2) water quality that is changeable byrain fall, sprays of sea water by strong wind, and the succession of microorganisms, and (3) natural enemies such as dytiscids (Coleoptera) and <b>notonectids</b> (Hemiptera) ...|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} aquatic invertebrate predators of amphibian eggs and tadpoles in an area of South Australia. The presence and abundance of aquatic invertebrates was monitored at four field sites for a period of 5 – 6 months; this revealed notonectids, freshwater crayfish and odonates to be amongst the most common invertebrate predator types. The ability of these predators to consume eggs and tadpoles of the native Australian frogs Litoria ewingi and Crinia signifera was then investigated. Freshwater crayfish (Cherax destructor) were the most prolific consumers of frog eggs and tadpoles. The <b>notonectid</b> Enithares woodwardi significantly impacted tadpole survivorship for both species while Anisops sp. was less successful at capturing and consuming these tadpoles. Caddisfly nymphs (Lectrides varians and Leptorussa darlingtoni) reduced egg survivorship but not to the same extent as C. destructor. Unlike some predators, which prey upon particular life stages, freshwater crayfish are large, polytrophic omnivores that can act as important predators of both anuran eggs and tadpoles. Given that predation is a key source of mortality in juveniles, identification of likely common predators is useful for understanding the regulation of amphibian populations...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} macroinvertebrate assemblage {{structure and composition}} across the three major waterbody types (temporary rivers, depression wetlands and semi-permanent dams) of the Eastern Cape Karoo, and to identify important environmental and spatial correlates of macroinvertebrate assemblage composition in the region. A total of 33 waterbodies (9 dams, 13 depression wetlands and 11 rivers) were sampled. Altogether, 91 taxa were recorded in November 2014 and 82 in April 2015. Twenty-seven taxa were common to all three waterbody types (across both sampling occasions), with 17 of these observed in November and 19 in April. The ANOSIM tests revealed significant differences in assemblage composition between the depression wetlands and rivers for both sampling occasions, but dams {{did not differ from}} the other waterbody types. SIMPER analyses indicated that the <b>notonectid</b> Anisops varia and the corixid Micronecta scutellaris were abundant across all three waterbody types during both sampling occasions. The mayfly Cloeon africanum and the damselfly Pseudagrion sp. were abundant in river habitats during both sampling occasions, while the gastropod mollusc Bulinus tropicus and the copepod Lovenula falcifera best characterised depression wetlands on both occasions. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination highlighted a clear separation of assemblages between November and April, while distance-based Redundancy Analysis revealed that conductivity, altitude, turbidity and pH were the most important variables explaining the variation in macroinvertebrate assemblage patterns.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of antipredator behaviours {{may depend on}} both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We experimentally studied the effects of predator species and prey age on the immediate survival value of swimming and lamellae loss in larval damselflies. Four predators: two invertebrates (the <b>notonectid,</b> Notonecta viridis and the dragonfly larva Aeshna cyanea), and two vertebrates (the three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus and the sunfish Lepomis gibbosus) were tested with all combinations of two instars of the damselfly Lestes sponsa (F- 0 and F- 2). The number of escapes by swimming away were much lower when larvae were attacked by the two fishes than by the two invertebrates. Moreover Lepomis never removed lamellae and killed all larvae. The instars {{did not differ in}} the number of escapes by swimming, but F- 0 instars were caught more at the lamellae than F- 2 instars. All larvae that survived a capture were caught at the lamellae and the majority (90 %) did so by autotomy. The ontogenetic increase in the immediate survival value of this antipredator behaviour was dependent upon the predator species. It was highest in captures by the Notonecta (40 %), and lower when larvae were caught by the Aeshna or Gasterosteus (ca. 17 %). This was probably because the biological relevance of the magnitude of the speed difference between damselfly instars depends upon the predator's attack performance. We discuss the consequences of these findings for the macrohabitat distribution of the larvae and for the multicomponent antipredator behaviours prey may use. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Dispersal is {{a central}} process {{determining}} community structure in heterogeneous landscapes, and species interactions within habitats may be {{a major determinant of}} dispersal. Although the effects of species interactions on dispersal within habitats have been well studied, how species interactions affect the movement of individuals between habitats in a landscape has received less attention. We conducted two experiments to assess the extent to which predation risk affects dispersal from an aquatic habitat by a flight-capable semi-aquatic insect (Notonecta undulata). Exposure to non-lethal (caged) fish fed conspecifics increased dispersal rates in N. undulata. Moreover, dispersal rate was positively correlated with the level of risk imposed by the fish; the greater the number of <b>notonectids</b> consumed by the caged fish, the greater the dispersal rate from the habitat. These results suggest that risk within a habitat can affect dispersal among habitats in a landscape and thus affect community structure on a much greater scale than the direct effect of predation itself...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{increased}} trophic complexity, through {{the addition of}} predatory <b>notonectids</b> (Anisops deanei), on temporary pond microcosms used for aquatic toxicity testing were studied.

The tanks were sampled regularly for nine weeks following the addition of the predators and the entire contents of each tank counted after 12 weeks. Analysis using non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) and non-parametric MANOVA showed that both Anisops and endosulfan at concentrations > 10 μg/L significantly altered community structure. However, an interaction between the effects of Anisops and the effects of endosulfan was not detected. The addition of Anisops did not increase the variability of response and thus did not reduce the sensitivity of the test method. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{ecology of}} {{mosquito}} populations {{in relation to}} weather conditions, emergent plants and predation in an urban wetland of Canberra was studied. Anopheles annulipes, Aedes notoscriptus, Aedes australicus, Aedes alboannulata, Culex annulirostris and Culex quinquefasciatus were found. Temperature was a major climatic factor in determining the abundance of mosquito populations in the wetland. First collections and subsequent development of mosquitoes in Ginninderra wetland are likely to depend on local weather conditions each year. The wetland proper was not a suitable habitat for mosquito breeding. Tall emergent vegetation may have obstructed oviposition and predation was also important in limiting colonization by mosquitoes. Instead, isolated temporary waterbodies which were free of predators, such as ground depressions, tyre tracks, domestic waste containers, {{were the most important}} habitats for mosquitoes adjacent to the Ginninderra wetland.

40|$|Community {{structure}} in backswimmers (Hemiptera: Notonectide), was investigated via extensive sampling throughout southern Arizona, USA, and Sonora, Mexico, from 1980 through 1985. Co-occurrence and relative abundance {{data were collected}} in more than 65 ponds, and in 177 rock basin pools (tinajas) in 21 canyons in the Southwest. Eleven species were collected in Arizona and Sonora, and {{were divided into two}} groups, species found in ponds and species found in tinajas. Only two species occurred significantly in both habitats. Tinaja species are largely Southwst endemics, and pond species are widespread or tropical in distribution. Data from artificial habitats suggest that the tinaja species use relatively high topographic relief, and pond species use relatively large surface area as cues to find their respective habitats. Two body size patterns are consistent with a competition explanation of local community structure. The body sizes of co-occurring species are relatively evenly distributed among species occurring in pond and tinaja habitats, and species of similar body size tend not to co-occur (body size ratio < 1. 3). For example, Notonecta kirbyi and N. lobata only co-occur in tinajas at intermediate elevations; lobata is absent at high elevations and kirbyi is absent at lower elevations. N. indica occurs in ponds at lower elevations and N. unifasciata occurs at higher elevations. Buenoa hungerfordi and B. arizonis both occur in tinajas, but not at the same time of year. Predation was shown experimentally not to be important in producing the body size pattern. Notonecta spp. preyed heavily on the smaller of two Buenoa species presented, an effect that would act to reduce the community-wide body size ratio. Because <b>notonectid</b> communities have larger body size ratios than expected by chance, predation would seem not to be involved in producing this pattern. However, predation does appear to reinforce microhabitat partitioning between the two genera in that Buenoa occupy deeper portions of the water column in the presence of Notonecta than in their absence. This further displaces coexisting individuals of the two genera in space, and reduces overlap in foraging for aquatic insect prey and promotes coexistence...|$|E
40|$|Background: Predation {{of aquatic}} {{immature}} stages {{has been identified}} as a major evolutionary force driving habitat segregation and niche partitioning in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto in the humid savannahs of Burkina Faso, West Africa. Here, we explored behavioural responses to the presence of a predator in wild populations of the M and S molecular forms of An. gambiae that typically breed in permanent (e. g., rice field paddies) and temporary (e. g., road ruts) water collections. Methods: Larvae used in these experiments were obtained from eggs laid by wild female An. gambiae collected from two localities in south-western Burkina Faso during the 2008 rainy season. Single larvae were observed in an experimental arena, and behavioural traits were recorded and quantified a) {{in the absence of a}} predator and b) in the presence of a widespread mosquito predator, the backswimmer Anisops jaczewskii. Differences in the proportion of time allocated to each behaviour were assessed using Principal Component Analysis and Multivariate Analysis of Variance. Results: The behaviour of M and S form larvae was found to differ significantly; although both forms mainly foraged at the water surface, spending 60 - 90 % of their time filtering water at the surface or along the wall of the container, M form larvae spent on average significantly more time browsing at the bottom of the container than S form larvae (4. 5 vs. 1. 3 % of their overall time, respectively; P < 0. 05). In the presence of a predator, larvae of both forms modified their behaviour, spending significantly more time resting along the container wall (P < 0. 001). This change in behaviour was at least twice as great in the M form (from 38. 6 to 66. 6 % of the time at the wall in the absence and presence of the predator, respectively) than in the S form (from 48. 3 to 64. 1 %). Thrashing at the water surface exposed larvae to a significantly greater risk of predation by the <b>notonectid</b> (P < 0. 01), whereas predation occurred significantly less often when larvae were at the container wall (P < 0. 05) and might reflect predator vigilance. Conclusions: Behavioural differences between larvae of the M and S form of An. gambiae in response to an acute predation risk is likely to be a reflection of different trade-offs between foraging and predator vigilance that might be of adaptive value in contrasting aquatic ecosystems. Future studies should explore the relevance of these findings under the wide range of natural settings where both forms co-exist in Africa. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
5000|$|Notonecta glauca is {{a species}} of aquatic insect, and a type of backswimmer. It is the most {{widespread}} and abundant of the four British <b>notonectids.</b> They are also found throughout North America. Notonecta glauca are Hemiptera (true bug) predators, that are approximately 13-16 mm in length. They {{are the most common}} backswimmer species (49%). Females have a larger body size compared to males. These water insects swim and rest on their back (hence their common name [...] "Backswimmer" [...] or [...] "Water Boatman") and are found under the water surface. Notonecta glauca supports itself under the water surface by using their front legs and mid legs and the back end of its abdomen and rest them on the water surface; They are able to stay under the water surface by water tension, also known as the air-water interface (Surface tension). they use the hind legs as oars. Notonecta glauca will either wait for its prey to pass by or will swim and actively hunt its prey. When the weather is warm, usually in the late summer and autumn, they will fly between ponds. Notonecta glauca reproduce in the spring.|$|R
