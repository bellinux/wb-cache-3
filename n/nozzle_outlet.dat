40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effects of nozzles with different angles on PDE performance, PDE with nozzles of different convergent and divergent angles were simulated and propane-air mixture was used. The simulation {{results indicated that the}} effects of nozzles with different angles on the pressure at the thrustwall of PDE and <b>nozzle</b> <b>outlet</b> were not the same. The pressure at the thrustwall and <b>nozzle</b> <b>outlet</b> of PDE with convergent nozzles was higher than that with divergent nozzles, and the pressure peak appeared earlier in the case of convergent nozzles. The peak value of the pressure at the <b>nozzle</b> <b>outlet</b> increased and appeared ahead of time as the convergent angle increased. The peak value of the pressure at the <b>nozzle</b> <b>outlet</b> increased and the evacuation time was prolonged with convergent nozzles. The pressure at the <b>nozzle</b> <b>outlet</b> dropped quickly and the evacuation time was shortened with divergent nozzles...|$|E

30|$|Compared to the SMD spatial {{distribution}} of the twin-fluid atomizing nozzle without a self-excited vibrating cavity, {{it can be concluded}} that the SMD was smaller and the coverage of droplets was bigger for the nozzle with a self-excited vibrating cavity. The strong collision of droplets between the <b>nozzle</b> <b>outlet</b> and vibrating cavity lead to the increase of the droplets’ radial velocity, which caused the coverage of droplets to increase remarkably. As seen, the SMD near the <b>nozzle</b> <b>outlet</b> without a self-excited vibrating cavity was about two times larger than that with a self-excited vibrating cavity. This result is due to the acoustic field which was generated by the intense oscillations of the self-excited vibrating cavity. Furthermore, this phenomenon can prove that the acoustics are beneficial to enhancing the atomization. Narayanan [26] had a similar discovery in the research of atomization in the acoustic field of a Hartmann whistle.|$|E

In addition, the influences of process parameters, including arc current, argon gas flow rate and the distance from the <b>nozzle</b> <b>outlet</b> to the anode workpiece, on the temperature distributions along the axial and radial direction were evaluated, respectively.

40|$|Inflow {{conditions}} for time dependent flow configurations are of major {{importance for the}} developing flow field and mixing characteristics. The wall heat transfer rates for impinging jets may be significantly affected by perturbations at the jet nozzle. This effect, however, depends on the plate distance to nozzle spacing. For large enough distance to nozzle spacing {{the influence of the}} inlet conditions is less significant at the target plate. By applying active forcing at the velocity inlet the wall heat transfer at the impingement plate may be controlled. The forcing here is sinusoidal and it is applied only in the streamwise direction at the velocity inlet of a circular nozzle. The computations included a range of Reynolds numbers (4500 to 30 000) and a range of nozzle-to-plate spacings (0. 5 to 12). Here, we consider mainly a case of Re = 20000 and plate distance of two jet diameters. The Turbulent flow and mixing is modeled using Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The results are obtained on rather fine grids and some of the results are compared to relevant experimental data. The sensitivity of the results to inlet conditions shows that direct comparison with experimental results may not be easy or conclussive. However, the LES results agree well with the experimental ones, i. e. within the expected variations (due to uncertainties in inlet conditions) in the different results.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{deals with}} the flash X-ray {{diagnostics}} of dodecane sprays produced in ambient air and in a high pressure chamber filled up to 30 bars of nitrogen. The sprays are generated through serial vehicle injectors having six holes of 150 µm in diameter. The injector is pressurized from a few hundreds of bars up to 1200 bars and injection durations are of a few hundreds of microseconds, these parameters representing typical operation conditions of such injectors in vehicle engine technology. The flash X-ray source developed for this study delivers X-ray pulse, 20 ns in duration, of X-ray photons essentially emitted in the copper characteristic lines around 8 keV. Such characteristics allow for the recording of radiographs, {{with the use of}} an X-ray camera, of pure, non seeded dodecane sprays in the near nozzle region, up to 4 mm downstream the <b>nozzle</b> <b>outlet.</b> Radiographies obtained by averaging over a few thousands of X-ray shots allow for the determination of the near nozzle spray density. The very short X-ray exposure also allow for time resolved analysis of the spray expansion in the high pressure chamber. Such time resolved analysis was performed on a microsecond time scale to study the spray expansion. Two main observations have been recently obtained and confirm some data obtained by groups [1] studying such spray doped with a cerium additive and using 8 keV synchrotron X-ray on very large scale facility. First, the density measured at the <b>nozzle</b> <b>outlet</b> appears to be well below that awaited if the spray would consist in a pure liquid column on the first diameter of expansion. A significant decrease of the axial spray density from the <b>nozzle</b> <b>outlet</b> over the three first millimetres downstream the propagation path was also measured. Second, time resolved X-ray radiography show evidence for a non intuitive behaviour of the spray propagation velocity in the near nozzle region. It has been measured that the spray expansion velocity tends to accelerate along the three first millimetres downstream of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>outlet.</b> These X-ray measurements appear as the first, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, obtained in non doped dodecane sprays using a table top X-ray source. Work is ongoing to enhance the spatial resolution and range of applicability of our diagnostics. [1] A. L. Kastengren, C. F. Powell, K. -S. Im, Y. -J. Wang and J.

SPACE, a safety analysis code for thermal hydraulic systems which is currently being developed, was designed to have the capacity of multi-dimensional two-phase thermo-dynamic phenomena induced in the various phases of a nuclear system. To validate the performance of SPACE, a two-dimensional two-phase flow test was performed with slab geometry of the test section having a scale of 1. 43 m × 1. 43 m × 0. 11 m.

The next chapter explains the processes that take place when liquid state LPG is injected into the air flow of an internal combustion engine intake manifold.
