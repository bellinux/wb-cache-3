5|$|The rioting {{impacted}} Chicago's economy. Some of the South Side's {{industry was}} closed during the riot. Businesses in the Loop were also affected by {{closure of the}} street cars. Many workers stayed away from affected areas. At the Union Stock Yard, one of Chicago's largest employers, all 15,000 African-American workers were initially expected {{to return to work}} on Monday, August 4, 1919. But after arson near white employees' homes near the Stock Yards on August 3, the management banned African-American employees from the stockyards in fear of further rioting. Governor Lowden noted his opinion that the troubles were related to labor issues rather than race. Nearly one-third of the African-American employees were <b>non-union,</b> and were resented by union employees for that reason. African-American workers were kept out of the stockyards for ten days {{after the end of the}} riot because of continued unrest. On August 8, 1919, about 3,000 <b>non-union</b> African Americans showed up for work under protection of special police, deputy sheriffs, and militia. The white union employees threatened to strike unless such security forces were discontinued. Their main grievance against African Americans was that they were <b>non-union</b> and had been used by management as strikebreakers in earlier years. Many African Americans fled the city as a result of the riots and damage.|$|E
30|$|Femoral <b>non-unions</b> have {{no clear}} {{evidence-based}} treatment guidelines. A recent systematic review by Somford et al. [22] has suggested a treatment algorithm for femoral <b>non-unions.</b> They specifically provide treatment recommendations for femoral <b>non-unions</b> that occur after initial internal fixation, suggesting reamed nailing after previous plating and plate fixation after previous intramedullary nailing. This underlines the basic reconstructive principle {{that when one}} mode of fixation has failed, another mode of fixation should be considered for the revision surgery.|$|R
30|$|Controversy on the {{treatment}} of long bone <b>non-unions</b> still exists among orthopaedic surgeons [1]. Primary goal in {{the treatment}} of these conditions is to achieve the healing of the fracture with satisfactory limb function. Internal fixation with lag screws and contoured plates to maintain or add compression has been proposed to manage bone <b>non-unions,</b> particularly in the upper limb [2]. The dynamic or static intramedullary nailing is the golden standard treatment for displaced <b>non-unions</b> of the lower limb [3].|$|R
40|$|Bone {{morphogenetic}} proteins (BMPs) {{are increasingly}} being used clinically to enhance fracture repair and healing of <b>non-unions.</b> However, the potential efficacy of supraphysiological dosing for clinical results warrants further clarification of the BMP signaling pathway in human fracture healing.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to document co-expression of BMPs, pSmad 1 / 5 / 8, and BMP-inhibitors in human fracture callus and human <b>non-unions.</b> Using human tissue of fracture callus (n = 14) and <b>non-unions</b> (n = 4) we documented expression of BMPs (BMP 2, BMP 3 and BMP 7), pSmad 1 / 5 / 8 and the BMP-inhibitors noggin, gremlin, chordin, Smad- 6, Smad- 7 and BAMBI. Co-expression of pSmad 1 / 5 / 8, BMPs and BMP-inhibitors was noted in the osteoblasts of fracture callus as well as of <b>non-unions.</b> Expression of BMP-inhibitors was generally stronger in <b>non-unions</b> than in fracture callus. The most pertinent differences were noted in the cartilaginous tissue components. Expression of BMP 2 in chondrocytes was markedly decreased in <b>non-unions</b> compared to fracture callus and that of BMP 7 was almost completely absent. Expression of BMP-inhibitors was almost the same in osteoblasts, chondrocytes and fibroblasts of fracture callus and well as in <b>non-unions.</b> Interestingly, although BMP ligands were present in the chondrocytes and fibroblasts of <b>non-unions,</b> they did not co-express pSmad 1 / 5 / 8 suggesting that BMP signaling may have been inhibited at some point before Smad 1 / 5 / 8 phosphorylation. These results suggest co-expression of BMP, pSmad 1 / 5 / 8 and BMP-inhibitors occurs in human fracture callus as well as <b>non-unions</b> but the relative expression of BMPs vs. BMP-inhibitors was different between these two tissue types. In contrast to our expectations, the expression of BMP inhibitors was comparable between fracture callus and <b>non-unions,</b> whereas the expression of BMPs was notably lower in the cartilaginous component of the <b>non-unions</b> in comparison to fracture callus. Based on these results, we believe that aberrations in the BMP-signaling pathway in the cartilaginous component of fracture healing could influence clinical fracture healing. An imbalance between the local presence of BMP and BMP-inhibitors may switch the direction towards healing or non-healing of a fracture. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserve...|$|R

5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the steel {{industry}} in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S. Following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers. The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed. The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, <b>non-union</b> jobs. Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.|$|E

5|$|After helping {{oversee the}} {{repatriation}} of soldiers back to Australia, Leane {{returned home to}} South Australia in late 1919. In May the following year he {{was selected as the}} next Commissioner of the South Australia Police, taking up the appointment in July. His appointment was initially controversial within the force, as there had been an established practice of selecting the commissioner from within its ranks. Leane also returned to part-time soldiering, commanding at the brigade level until 1926, not without controversy. His administration of the police force was generally praised, although he did have to weather several storms, one of which involved a royal commission into bribery of some of his officers by bookmakers. He was a foundation member and inaugural president of the Legacy Club of Adelaide, established to assist the dependents of deceased ex-servicemen. In 1928, during a major dispute over the industrial award applying to waterfront labourers, Leane provided police protection to <b>non-union</b> workers, and on one occasion personally led a force of 150 police that successfully confronted a crowd of 2,000 waterside labourers who wanted to remove <b>non-union</b> workers from Adelaide ports. As commissioner, he introduced a number of innovations, including cadets and probationary training for young recruits, police dogs, and traffic accident analysis. After the outbreak of World War II, despite being on the retired list, Leane became the state commander of the Returned and Services League-organised Volunteer Defence Corps, a form of home guard, in addition to his duties as commissioner. After retiring in 1944, he was knighted for his services during 24 years {{at the head of the}} police force. In retirement he became involved in conservative politics, and remained active with returned servicemen's associations until his death in 1962.|$|E

Results: Twenty eight (87. 4 %) of the thirty two valgusing osteotomies evolved to femoral neck union, while four cases (12. 6 %) evolved to total hip arthroplasty. Eight cases evolved to partial osteonecrosis. Conclusions: The valgusing intertrochanteric osteotomy for treating femoral neck <b>non-unions</b> achieved consolidation in 87. 4 % (28 / 32).

5|$|Nevertheless, Weaver was {{appointed}} by Premier Thomas Bavin on 16 April 1929 as the Secretary for Mines and Minister for Forests. Taking over the worsening dispute on the northern coalfields, he believed the struggle to be communist-inspired and made possible by unemployment relief and child endowment and attempted to resolve an industrial dispute by supporting the use of <b>non-union</b> labour in the Rothbury coal mine. The resultant protests led to the Rothbury Riot {{and the death of}} one miner. His suspension of unemployment relief gained him many enemies from the Labor Party. This promotion proved short-lived however, when the Bavin Government was defeated at the October 1930 election, at which Weaver was returned with 65.42%, by Jack Lang's Australian Labor Party.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} weekend, some 1,000 volunteers were sworn-in {{as part of}} the Citizens' Defence Brigade, a force of special constables raised at Leane's request to augment the police in dealing with the waterfront dispute. The brigade was based at Fort Largs and was equipped with service rifles and bayonets. The men were quickly posted at the wharves to maintain law and order. During the dispute, Leane slept in an office at the port so that he was on hand to deal with any emergencies. Leane's decision to arm the mostly inexperienced volunteers with bayonets was later criticised in Parliament. The dispute continued on, with major disturbances at Port Adelaide on 14 January 1929 which resulted in many injuries, and another on 17 January. A significant police presence was required at the wharves into 1930 to deal with disturbances and assaults on <b>non-union</b> workers, and Leane personally supervised police operations there on several occasions.|$|E

5|$|Trucking {{companies}} (motor carriers) {{can also}} play a role in HOS violations. Certain carriers may choose to knowingly ignore HOS violations made by their drivers, or even encourage their drivers to do so. Allowing drivers to violate the HOS is an effective cost-cutting measure used mostly by <b>non-union,</b> long haul carriers. Permitting HOS violations allows a carrier to hire fewer drivers, and run on fewer trucks than a company which follows the rules. To comply with the HOS, these companies would have to hire more drivers (possibly driving up wages) and purchase additional trucks and trailers. Making a change to comply with the law is complicated by competition with carriers that already comply with HOS regulations. Due to this competition, carriers who choose to switch from non-compliance could not pass on all of their increased costs associated with HOS compliance to their customers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Interlocking nailing, {{which has}} become the method of choice for {{treating}} fractures of the femoral and tibial shafts, still lacks ability to provide the important contact-compression at the fracture. An intramedullary compression nail is described, which provides axial compression at the fracture site with tightening of the specially designed distal interlocking screw. This uses the same principle as dynamic compression plating. Methods The study included 11 femoral and tibial nailings performed for various clinical applications such as acute fractures, <b>non-unions</b> and malunions. Results All the fractures attained radiological union, with good skeletal continuity across the fracture, within an average time of 13 weeks in fresh fractures and 18 weeks in <b>non-unions.</b> Conclusions Active compression through intramedullary compression nailing has great utility for treating <b>non-unions</b> where it provides greater degree of impaction of its irregular ends. This may prove greatly advantageous to the fracture union through increased stability and the osteogenic potential, particularly when utilized {{in combination with the}} small diameter unreamed nails. </p...|$|R

Bone segment transport was done in 18 patients who had greater than 2. 5  cm bone defect after debridement. Bone grafting was required in three patients to augment union. 				 					Results: All fractures united and infection eradicated completely. There were 13 excellent, nine good, and four fair results. Functional results were excellent in nine, good in 11, fair in five and poor in one. Pin site inflammation was the most common problem and occurred in 23 (88 %) patients. There were no major complications or neurovascular complications.
