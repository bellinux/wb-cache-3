40|$|Abstract—Crosstalk {{reduction}} is analyzed for a reconfigured category-five cable network using electromagnetic topology-based simulation. The reconfigured network {{results in a}} marked reduction in inductive <b>near-end</b> <b>crosstalk</b> for the unshielded twisted-pair cable network. Analyses show that half-loop shifting of the generator-pair wires placed next to the receptor {{is the most effective}} way to control the <b>near-end</b> <b>crosstalk</b> level. This is primarily due to additional coupling sources induced on receptor wires that effectively deactivate the original cross coupling effect. The analysis also reveals the usefulness of electromagnetic topology-based simulations. The technique applied in this paper is applicable for any large network systems. A sub-network compaction scheme is critical in creating the equivalent junctions that provide a significant reduction in total computational time and total computer memory requirement for analyzing large network systems.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 The {{primary goal}} of this thesis is to {{fabricate}} a magnetic film between the coplanar transmitted stripline for crosstalk suppression. Crosstalk is caused from undesired inductive and capacitive coupling of signals between two conductors. The effective crosstalk suppression results from the inductive coupling of circuit elements through the lossy properties of magnetic material during ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). Several techniques were used to fabricate ferrite films, including ferrite plating, screen printing, and pressure die casting. Ferrite plating produce nanostructured zinc iron oxide (ZnFe₂O₄) films with lower crystallinity and do not exhibit cross talk suppression. Interesting, the films show a higher roughness with increasing film thickness. The contact angle measurement indicates the films changing from hydrophobic to hydrophilic with increasing film thickness. Screen printing was used to fabricate yttrium iron garnet (Y₃Fe₅O₁₂) films to replace ferrite plating zinc ferrite films, because of the magnetic properties of yttrium iron garnet film. The results show that screen-printed films can achieve far-end crosstalk suppression by 10 12 dB, however, no suppression effect for <b>near-end</b> <b>crosstalk.</b> It is believed that the polymeric binder caused the problem. A pressure die casting technique was used to fabricate the yttrium iron garnet films.

30|$|In {{a digital}} {{subscriber}} line (DSL) system with strong crosstalk, the detection and cancellation of interference signals {{have the potential to}} improve the overall data rate performance. However, as DSL crosstalk channels are highly frequency selective and multiuser detection is suitable only when crosstalk is strong, the set of frequency tones in which multiuser detection may be used must be carefully chosen. Further, this problem of tone selection is highly coupled with the transmit power spectra of both direct and interfering signals, so the optimal solution requires the tone selection problem to be solved jointly with the multiuser spectrum optimization problem. The main idea of this paper is that the above joint optimization may be done efficiently using a dual decomposition technique {{similar to that of the}} optimal spectrum balancing algorithm.
