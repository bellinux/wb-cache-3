However Artur accidentally drips paint on <b>Nate,</b> landing in his eye, and having him knock over the ladder.

Detention is over, and <b>Nate</b> tries to get to the scout troop meeting in his best friend Teddy's house on his skateboard, which lands in oily water under a bridge (due to him landing into a woman's dog's stretched leash). This results in <b>Nate</b> having to walk and being late and ultimately missing the meeting. To make matters worse, his best friend Francis and Teddy tell him they have great news: Artur has joined their scout troop, much to <b>Nate's</b> horror. <b>Nate</b> is also angry because he would've gotten the whole attendance merit badge in addition to the ones he already has, because he has to attend all 26 meetings (six months), and missed the 25th meeting, meaning he has to start all over again.

The problem is that Artur goes out with Jenny, <b>Nate's</b> crush, and <b>Nate</b> thinks he's a better match for Jenny than Artur and says that he's known her longer. <b>Nate</b> thinks of a way to convince Artur to go out with Gina and dump Jenny so <b>Nate</b> can go out with Jenny. <b>Nate</b> opens his locker to [...] "Sweep Jenny off her feet".
