Similar models and validation efforts are reviewed. Then, the main equations of the GN model are introduced. An intuitive physical interpretation of the equations and their features is proposed. The main characteristics of the non-linear interference (NLI) noise spectra that the GN model produces are discussed. To ease model exploitation, a new formulation in hyperbolic coordinates is proposed, which makes numerical integration faster. New approximate closed-form solutions are also provided.

5000|$|The {{effect of}} adding {{multiple}} layers of gypsum wallboard to a frame also varies depending on the framing type and configuration. Doubling the mass of a partition does not double the STC, as the STC is calculated from a <b>non-linear</b> decibel sound <b>transmission</b> loss measurement. So, whereas installing an additional layer of gypsum wallboard to a light-gauge (25-ga. or lighter) steel stud partition will result in about a 5 STC-point increase, doing the same on single wood or single heavy-gauge steel will result in only 2 to 3 additional STC points. Adding a second additional layer (to the already 3-layer system) does not result in as drastic an STC change as the first additional layer. The effect of additional gypsum wallboard layers on double- and staggered-stud partitions {{is similar to that}} of light-gauge steel partitions. Due to increased mass, poured concrete and concrete blocks typically achieve higher STC values (in the mid STC 40s to the mid STC 50s) than equally thick framed walls. [...] However the additional weight, added complexity of construction, and poor thermal insulation tend to limit masonry wall partitions as a viable sound isolation solution in many building construction projects. Temperate climates and hurricane- or tornado-prone areas may, however, require the use of masonry walls for structural stability.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{numerical}} method {{has been proposed}} {{for the analysis of}} highlydispersive linear and non-linear metamaterial structures. Initially, pulse propagation along <b>non-linear</b> composite right/left-handed <b>transmission</b> line (CRLH TL) has been carefully studied. For this purpose, a dispersive CRLH line has been loaded with hyper abrupt diodes to achieve non-linearity. The characteristic impedance and propagation constant of each unit cell of the CRLH TL is then varied at each time-step, and the nonuniform line is analyzed. A novel interpolation scheme, based on the smooth behaviour of the propagation constant with small variations of the shunt capacitor has been proposed. This scheme has provided an 80 % reduction of the computational cost maintaining high accuracy. A general example which combines dispersion and nonlinearity has finally been presented, validated and discussed. Secondly, the impulseregime radiation of a leaky-wave antenna has been analyzed and employed to describe a real-time spectrogram analyzer (RTSA). A calibration method for the system, which takes into account the directivity variation of the antenna with frequency, has been introduced.

40|$|AbstractThe exciton {{equilibration}} in {{the major}} chlorophyll a/b light-harvesting complex from spinach thylakoid membranes was analysed by <b>non-linear</b> <b>transmission</b> spectroscopy and pump-probe spectroscopy under quasi-stationary conditions at room temperature. Investigations of the <b>non-linear</b> <b>transmission</b> in the Qy transitions of Chl a/b absorption indicate that excited state absorption dominates in the wavelength regions between 620 nm and 650 nm and between 685 nm and 690 nm, whereas bleaching and stimulated emission is predominant from 650 nm to 685 nm. The pump-probe transmission spectra suggest that in isolated light-harvesting complexes of Photosystem II (LHC II) the excitons are thermally equilibrated over all spectral chlorophyll forms nearly independent of the excitation wavelength. An analogous phenomenon is not observed in Photosystem II (PS II) membrane fragments. Regardless of differences between isolated LHC II and PS II membrane fragments in both samples, the maximum of the exciton density is located at around 680 nm independent of excitation intensity and wavelength. The maximum of exciton distribution in the Chl b absorption region {{is located at the}} absorption maximum of Chl b at 650 nm. The room-temperature exciton equilibration in the wavelength region of Chl a absorption can be described by a Boltzmann distribution.

40|$|The {{northern}} Great Plains (NGP) of the United States {{has been}} a hotspot of West Nile virus (WNV) incidence since 2002. Mosquito ecology and the transmission of vector-borne disease are influenced by multiple environmental factors, and climatic variability is an important driver of inter-annual variation in WNV transmission risk. This study applied multiple environmental predictors including land surface temperature (LST), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) derived from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products to establish prediction models for WNV risk in the NGP. These environmental metrics are sensitive to seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations in temperature and precipitation, and are hypothesized to influence mosquito population dynamics and WNV <b>transmission.</b> <b>Non-linear</b> generalized additive models (GAMs) were {{used to evaluate the}} influences of deviations of cumulative LST, NDVI, and ETa on inter-annual variations of WNV incidence from 2004 – 2010.

40|$|The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar L., {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{damaging}} pests of the deciduous forests in the United States. It was accidentally introduced from Europe in 1868 by an amateur naturalist in eastern Massachusetts. High density gypsy moth populations are regulated primarily by a nuclear polyhedrosis virus (LdNPV). LdNPV is transmitted by feeding the LdNPV contaminated foliage or the contaminated egg chorion on the way out from the egg by a larva. In 1989, an entomophthoralean fungus, Entomophaga maimaiga Humber, Shimazu et Soper was discovered in the northeastern United States, which caused massive epizootic in both low and high density gypsy moth populations. My study focused on the interactions between E. maimaiga and LdNPV. Laboratory bioassays in which I inoculated gypsy moth larvae with LdNPV and E. maimaiga at the same time indicated that the majority of dually inoculated larvae die from E. maimaiga because of the shorter incubation period of E. maimaiga (5 - 7 days) compared to LdNPV (14 days) at 20 ∘C. When the larvae were inoculated with E. maimaiga, 10 days after LdNPV inoculation, there was an apparent synergistic effect of E. maimaiga with LdNPV. Dually inoculated larvae died producing LdNPV propagules, 1 - 2 days earlier than the larvae inoculated with LdNPV alone. Small-scale field experiments conducted in mesh-bags showed that artificial rainfall increases the E. maimaiga transmission. In a naturally occurring, moderate density gypsy moth population, I found that the LdNPV infection level was little affected by the presence of E. maimaiga. Host heterogeneity is suspected as one of the factors leading <b>non-linear</b> LdNPV <b>transmissions.</b> I showed that the host heterogeneity cannot explain the E. maimaiga epizootic observed in low density populations. I experimentally demonstrated this by comparing the E. maimaiga infection rates in feral (experienced the E. maimaiga/LdNPV epizootic in their parental generations) and laboratory reared (with no epizootic experience) larvae. This is probably due to the short period to which the North American gypsy moths have been exposed to E. maimaiga, so these gypsy moths have not had chance to develop resistance against E. maimaiga. ...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that {{unwanted}} noise has many harmful effects on human beings. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} limit noise in the living and working environment as much as possible. Structure-borne installation noise is noise which originates because vibrating objects like machines or ducts are connected to the building structure. The structure radiates the induced vibrations as sound in each space of the building. The ambition of this dissertation is to quantitatively determine the supplied structure-borne power in the source space on one hand and the resulting installation noise in the receiver space on the other hand. This way, the acoustical quality of a building can already be judged in the design phase and, if necessary, parameters can be changed if the obtained acoustical quality is insufficient. A straightforward technique to determine the injected structure-borne sound power uses simultaneous measurement of the force and the velocity at the contact points between installation and building element. However, measuring the force directly is difficult in practice, which is why a structural-acoustical inverse technique is used which allows the force to be determined indirectly using the principle of reciprocity. A number of predictive techniques are tested to determine the injected structure-borne sound power. Advantages and difficulties are discussed for a vibrating platform, washing machine and tapping machine as sources and heavyweight concrete floors, a lightweight wooden floor and a floating floor as receiving building elements. Since the result depends on the specific situation of installation and building element, there is no reliable technique which is universally applicable. Dominating airborne sound <b>transmission,</b> <b>non-linear</b> behaviour of installations and matrix inversions are shown to be important points of attention.
