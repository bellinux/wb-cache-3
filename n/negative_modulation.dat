50|$|Another {{parameter}} of analog television systems, minor by comparison, is {{the choice}} of whether vision modulation is positive or negative. Some of the earliest electronic television systems such as the British 405-line (system A) used positive modulation. It was also used in the two Belgian systems (system C, 625 lines, and System F, 819 lines) and the two French systems (system E, 819 lines, and system L, 625 lines). In positive modulation systems, as in the earlier white facsimile transmission standard, the maximum luminance value {{is represented by the}} maximum carrier power; in <b>negative</b> <b>modulation,</b> the maximum luminance value is represented by zero carrier power. All newer analog video systems use <b>negative</b> <b>modulation</b> {{with the exception of the}} French System L.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>negative</b> <b>modulation</b> in later systems simplified the problem because peak carrier power represented sync pulses (which were always {{guaranteed to be}} present).

50|$|<b>Negative</b> {{allosteric}} <b>modulation</b> (also {{known as}} allosteric inhibition) {{occurs when the}} binding of one ligand decreases the affinity for substrate at other active sites.

50|$|Another {{advantage}} of <b>negative</b> <b>modulation</b> is that, since the synchronizing pulses represent maximum carrier power, {{it is relatively}} easy to arrange the receiver automatic gain control to only operate during sync pulses and thus get a constant amplitude video signal to drive the rest of the TV set.

50|$|The use of AM (rather than FM) {{for sound}} {{and the use of}} {{positive}} (rather than negative) video modulation made 405-line signals very prone to visible impulse interference, such as that generated by the ignition systems of vehicles. Such interference manifested itself as a loud popping on sound and large bright spots on the picture, which viewers found much more noticeable than the dark spots encountered when such interference is encountered on a signal using negative video modulation. With positive modulation, interference could easily be of similar amplitude to the sync pulses (which were represented by 0-30% of the transmitter output). The early time-base circuits were less able to discriminate between the signals and the picture would break up. By contrast, in <b>negative</b> <b>modulation</b> sync, pulses represent peak transmitter output (70-100% output). As a result, impulse interference would cause visual dark spots before it was large enough to affect the synchronisation of the picture. If the interference was large enough, the picture was probably unwatchable anyway. The later introduction of flywheel sync circuits rendered the picture much more stable, but these could have alleviated some of the problems with positive modulation. Almost all television systems that succeeded the 405-line system adopted <b>negative</b> <b>modulation</b> for this reason alone.|$|E

In addition, the ability of RpiA to regulate cell proliferation and colony formation in different liver cancer cell lines required ERK signaling as well as the <b>negative</b> <b>modulation</b> of PP2A activity and that the effects of RpiA could be modulated by the addition of either a PP2A inhibitor or activator.

40|$|Standing slow mode {{waves in}} hot flaring loops are {{exclusively}} observed in spectrometers {{and are used}} to diagnose the magnetic field strength and temperature of the loop structure. Due {{to the lack of}} spatial information, the longitudinal mode cannot be effectively identified. In this study, we simulate standing slow mode waves in flaring loops and compare the synthesized line emission properties with SUMER spectrographic and SDO/AIA imaging observations. We find that the emission intensity and line width oscillations are a quarter period out of phase with Doppler shift velocity both in time and spatial domain, which can be used to identify a standing slow mode wave from spectroscopic observations. However, the longitudinal overtones could be only measured with the assistance of imagers. We find emission intensity asymmetry in the positive and <b>negative</b> <b>modulations,</b> this is because the contribution function pertaining to the atomic emission process responds differently to positive and negative temperature variations. One may detect half periodicity close to the loop apex, where emission intensity modulation is relatively small. The line-of-sight projection affects the observation of Doppler shift significantly. A more accurate estimate of the amplitude of velocity perturbation is obtained by de-projecting the Doppler shift by a factor of 1 - 2 θ/π rather than the traditionally used cosθ. If a loop is heated to the hotter wing, the intensity modulation could be overwhelmed by background emission, while the Doppler shift velocity could still be detected to a certain extent.

Spectrotemporal analysis of interaurally time-delayed highpass waveforms reveals {{the presence of}} a concomitant interaural level cue. The current study systematically investigated the contribution of time and concomitant level cues carried by positive and negative envelope slopes of a modified sinusoidally amplitude-modulated (SAM) high-frequency carrier. The waveforms were generated from concatenation of individual modulation cycles whose envelope peaks were extended by the desired interaural delay, allowing independent control of delays in the positive and <b>negative</b> <b>modulation</b> slopes. In experiment 1, thresholds were measured using a 2 -interval forced-choice adaptive task for interaural delays in either the positive or <b>negative</b> <b>modulation</b> slopes. In a control condition, thresholds were measured for a standard SAM tone. In experiment 2, decision weights were estimated using a multiple-observation correlational method in a single-interval forced-choice task for interaural delays carried simultaneously by the positive, and independently, negative slopes of the modulation envelope. In experiment 3, decision weights were measured for groups of 3 modulation cycles at the start, middle, and end of the waveform to determine the influence of onset dominance or recency effects. Results were consistent across experiments: thresholds were equal for the positive and <b>negative</b> <b>modulation</b> slopes. Decision weights were positive and equal for the time cue in the positive and negative envelope slopes. Weights were also larger for modulations cycles near the waveform onset. Weights estimated for the concomitant interaural level cue were positive for the positive envelope slope and negative for the negative slope, consistent with exclusive use of time cues.

Understanding the motor impairments and the possible functional recovery of upper and lower extremities is of great importance. Animal models investigating motor dysfunction following cervical spinal cord injury are rare. We analysed the differential spontaneous recovery of fore- and hindlimb locomotion by detailed kinematic analysis in adult rats with unilateral C 4 /C 5 hemisection, a lesion {{that leads to the}} Brown-Séquard syndrome in humans. The results showed disproportionately better performance of hindlimb compared with forelimb locomotion; hindlimb locomotion showed substantial recovery, whereas the ipsilesional forelimb remained in a very poor functional state. Such a differential motor recovery pattern is also known to occur in monkeys and in humans after similar spinal cord lesions. On the lesioned side, cortico-, rubro-, vestibulo- and reticulospinal tracts and the important modulatory serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic fibre systems were interrupted by the lesion. In an attempt to facilitate locomotion, different monoaminergic agonists were injected intrathecally. Injections of specific serotonergic and noradrenergic agonists in the chronic phase after the spinal cord lesion revealed remarkable, although mostly functionally <b>negative,</b> <b>modulations</b> of particular parameters of hindlimb locomotion. In contrast, forelimb locomotion was mostly unresponsive to these agonists.

40|$|Vertebrate {{skeletal}} muscle contraction and relaxation {{is a complex}} process that depends on Ca 2 + ions to promote the interaction of actin and myosin. This process can be modulated by nitric oxide (NO), a gas molecule synthesized endogenously by (nitric oxide synthase) NOS isoforms. At nanomolar concentrations NO activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which in turn activates protein kinase G via conversion of GTP into cyclic GMP. Alternatively, NO post-translationally modifies proteins via S-nitrosylation of the thiol group of cysteine. However, the mechanisms of action of NO on Ca 2 + homeostasis during muscle contraction are not fully understood and we hypothesize that NO exerts its effects on Ca 2 + homeostasis in {{skeletal muscle}}s mainly through <b>negative</b> <b>modulation</b> of Ca 2 + release and Ca 2 + uptake via the NO-sGC-PKG pathway. To address this, we used 5 – 7 days-post fecundation-larvae of zebrafish, a well-established animal model for physiological and pathophysiological muscle activity. We evaluated the response of muscle contraction and Ca 2 + transients in presence of SNAP, a NO-donor, or L-NAME, an unspecific NOS blocker in combination with specific blockers of key proteins of Ca 2 + homeostasis. We also evaluate the expression of NOS in combination with dihydropteridine receptor, ryanodine receptor and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + ATPase.

We used fMRI to examine spider-phobic and control participants while they imagined visiting different locations in a forest after having received background information about the likelihood of encountering different animals (spiders, snakes, and birds) at these locations. Critically, imagined encounter expectancies modulated brain responses differently in phobics as compared with controls.

PFK can be allosterically inhibited by high levels of ATP within the cell. When ATP levels are high, ATP will bind to an allosteoric site on phosphofructokinase, causing {{a change in the}} enzyme's three-dimensional shape.

In this way, ATP serves as a negative allosteric modulator for PFK, {{despite the fact that it}} is also a substrate of the enzyme.|$|R
