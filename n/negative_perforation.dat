50|$|There are various, albeit minor, {{technical}} {{differences in}} the film perforations between Kinopanorama, {{which at the time}} of its invention was milled to accept the Kodak Standard (KS 1866) 'positive perforation' 4740 short-pitch camera negative stock, and those of the Cinerama and Cinemiracle cameras. Cinerama and Cinemiracle employ Bell and Howell (BH 1866) 'negative perforation' 4740 short-pitch and Dubray-Howell long-pitch 'negative perforation', respectively, for their modified Mitchell cameras. It is believed that the prototype Cinerama camera number one, on display in the foyer of the National Media Museum in Bradford, West Yorkshire, UK, was originally milled for Dubray-Howell <b>negative</b> <b>perforations,</b> although this has never been confirmed. The first Kinopanorama film, Vast is my Native Land, which in North America was titled Great Is My Country, was premiered on 28 February 1958, at the Mir Kino Theatre in Moscow. The event was profiled in the New York Times. The Enchanted Mirror, the second Kinopanorama film, received a special prize at the Brussels World's Fair known as Expo '58. Eight Kinopanorama travelogues were produced in the original three-lens format (plus an additional seven in single-negative Kinopanorama 70) until 1966. Opasniye Povoroty, the first dramatic film (released internationally in 1962) was produced with an improved Kinopanorama camera, known as the PSO-1960. This redesigned camera, of which six were manufactured, allowed for the use of interchangeable lens kits of focal lengths from 27 mm to 100 mm, inclusive.|$|R
30|$|Early {{detection}} of appendicitis is crucial, as prompt treatment leads to better patient outcomes and fewer complications. Currently, the Alvarado scoring system {{is used in}} the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and is calculated {{out of a total of}} 10 points on the basis of symptoms, clinical findings, leukocyte count and radiological findings. However, the negative laparotomy rate is low when the score on this system is greater than 7. Observation and/or additional definite laboratory evaluation are needed for scores of 5 – 6 (Alvarado 1986). Clinicians still encounter problems such as <b>perforation,</b> <b>negative</b> appendectomy, mortality, morbidity, and long hospital stays in patients with acute appendicitis (Flum and Koepsell 2002).|$|R
40|$|Background: Graded {{compression}} ultrasonography (US) {{has become}} the most popular technique used in suspected appendicitis and in our prospective study, we have evaluated its contribution to the diagnosis of acute appendicitis during the period 2010 - 2013. Materials and Methods: Four hundred and eighty children underwent urgent abdominal suspected of having acute appendicitis. Patients were divided into operated groups; (220 patients) and non-operated (260 patients) the final diagnosis was established on histopathological findings in the first group and on the phone interview in the second one. US was the sole imaging modality in all the non-operated patients and in 203 out of 220 operated ones. Seven children in the operated group underwent CT, while a second US was performed in 10 patients. Results: Acute appendicitis was confirmed in 188 operated patients while no one in the non-operated group returned to the hospital or was operated for appendicitis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy were 79 %, 78 %, 95 %, 39 % and 79 %, respectively. <b>Negative</b> appendectomy and <b>perforation</b> rates were 14 % and 8 %. Seventeen children in the operated group required a second diagnostic imaging: 7 CTs and 10 USs. All the seven CTs were consistent with appendicitis and 6 out of 10 USs showed ecographic signs of appendicitis. Conclusion: Our results support routine US in all the children with suspected appendicitis because it helps in reducing <b>negative</b> appendectomy and <b>perforation</b> rate. Moreover, a negative US does not justify a subsequent and immediate CT because clinical re-evaluation and a second US can clarify the diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the efficacy of ultrasound in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in clinically suspected cases of acute appendicitis. A total of 110 patients clinically suspected to have acute appendicitis admitted to the surgery departments of Golestan and Imam Khomeini hospitals, from March 2006 to 2007. Abdomino-pelvic ultrasonography with focus on RLQ ultrasonographying the graded compression technique was done. Positive ultrasonography was defined as {{at least one of the}} criteria of puylaert. The sonographic data were prospectively correlated with clinical, operative and pathological findings. Graded compression ultrasonography results were analyzed and remarked 92. 7 % sensitivity, 94. 5 % specificity, 93 % accuracy, 94. 4 % positive predictive value and 92. 5 % negative predictive value. Ultrasonography is an accurate, safe and reliable method in the diagnosis of suspected cases of acute appendicitis that can help to minimize <b>negative</b> appendectomies and <b>perforation</b> rates...|$|R
30|$|Acute {{appendicitis}} (AA) is {{a common}} abdominal emergency with a lifetime prevalence of about 7  %. As the clinical diagnosis of AA remains a challenge to emergency physicians and surgeons, imaging modalities have gained major importance in the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected AA {{in order to keep}} both the negative appendectomy rate and the perforation rate low. Introduced in 1986, graded-compression ultrasound (US) has well-established direct and indirect signs for diagnosing AA. In our opinion, US should be the first-line imaging modality, as graded-compression US has excellent specificity both in the paediatric and adult patient populations. As US sensitivity is limited, and non-diagnostic US examinations with non-visualization of the appendix are more a rule than an exception, diagnostic strategies and algorithms after non-diagnostic US should focus on clinical reassessment and complementary imaging with MRI/CT if indicated. Accordingly, both ionizing radiation to our patients and cost of pre-therapeutic diagnosis of AA will be low, with low <b>negative</b> appendectomy and <b>perforation</b> rates.|$|R
40|$|Does {{access to}} care affect {{outcomes}} of appendicitis in children?- a population-based cohort study Teresa To 1, 2, 3 *, Jacob C Langer 4 Background: The annual number of pediatric appendectomies in Ontario was stable throughout the study period, but with a significant level of regional variations across regions. The objective {{of this study is}} to use populationbased data to measure the associations and to explain the variations of appendectomy rates with population socio-demographic indicators. Methods: Appendectomy rates in children aged less than 19 years were calculated from Ontario hospital discharge data from 1993 to 2000. Small area variations in appendectomy and correlations between sociodemographic indicators were studied. Multiple logistic regression was used to measure the risk of <b>negative</b> appendectomy and <b>perforation</b> while adjusting for socio-demographic factors. Results: The rate of positive primary appendectomy has been stable since 1993 with an average rate of 93. 2 per 100, 000 children.

5000|$|KS perfs: Because BH perfs have sharp corners, the {{repeated}} {{use of the}} film through intermittent movement projectors creates strain that can easily tear the perforations. Furthermore, they tended to shrink as the print slowly decayed. Therefore, larger perforations with a rectangular base and rounded corners were introduced by Kodak in 1924 to improve steadiness, registration, durability, and longevity. Known as [...] "Kodak Standard" [...] (KS), they are 0.0780 inches (1.981 mm) high by 0.1100 inches (2.794 mm) wide. Their durability makes KS perfs the ideal choice for some (but not all) intermediate and all release prints, and original camera negatives which require special use, such as high-speed filming, but not for bluescreen, front projection, rear projection, or matte work as these specific applications demand the more accurate registration which is only possible with BH or DH perforations. The increased height also means that the image registration was considerably less accurate than BH perfs, which remains the standard for <b>negatives.</b> The KS1870 <b>perforation,</b> or KS perforation with a pitch of 0.1870 in, is the modern standard for release prints.|$|R

5000|$|The {{negative}} film had the perforations (of the CS [...] "Fox-hole" [...] type) {{close to the}} edge of the film and the camera aperture was 1.824" [...] by 1.430" [...] (approx. 46 mm x 36 mm), giving an image area of 2.61 sq. inch. This compares to the 0.866" [...] by 0.732" [...] (approx. 22 mm x 18.6 mm) frame of a modern anamorphic 35 mm negative, which provides a frame area of 0.64 sq. inch. On the print film, however, there was a smaller frame size of approximately 1.34" [...] x 1.06" [...] (34 mm x 27 mm) to allow space for the 6 magnetic soundtracks. Four of these soundtracks (two each side) were outside the perforations, which were further from the edges of the print film than in the {{negative film}}; the other two soundtracks were between the perforations and the image. The pull-down for the <b>negative</b> was 8 <b>perforations,</b> while for the smaller frame on the print film, it was 6 perforations. In both cases, however, the frame had an aspect ratio of 1.275:1, which when expanded by a 2:1 anamorphic lens resulted in an image of 2.55:1.|$|R
40|$|Hypothesis: Bowel {{perforation}} can {{be diagnosed}} by detection of orally administered technetium Tc 99 m sulfur colloid (99 mTc SC) in diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) fluid using a handheld -detection probe. Design A canine intestinal-injury model {{was used to}} test the hypothesis. The 99 mTc SC (55. 5 MBq) was administered in 500 mL of saline via a nasogastric tube. A DPL with 500 mL of saline was performed at 60, 90, and 120 minutes after administration of 99 mTc SC. The radioactivity in the DPL effluent was measured using a handheld probe. A DPL effluent count that was 3 SDs above the background count was considered a positive test result. Twenty animals with perforation and 5 without <b>perforation</b> (<b>negative</b> control) were studied. Results: There were no false-positive -DPL test results. Sensitivity improved by time up to 90 minutes. The lowest positive count in the DPL effluent measured by the probe corresponded to 0. 2 % of the administered activity. No radioactivity was detected in blood and urine samples or liver and spleen specimens. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values at 90 minutes were 95 %, 100 %, 96 %, 100 %, and 83 %, respectively. Conclusions: -Guided DPL is a highly sensitive and 100 % specific test in the detection of small-bowel perforation. Clinical studies are warranted to determine the patient-specific factors affecting diagnostic accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Background: Misdiagnosis {{of acute}} {{appendicitis}} {{is a common}} and crucial problem in general surgery. Graded compression ultrasonography {{is one of the}} new diagnostic technique that is reported to have improve the diagnostic accuracy and clinical outcome. The aim of current study is to assess the role of this diagnostic modality in the management of acute appendicitis. Methods: This is a cohort observational study comparing the adverse outcome in two different groups of patients admitted with suspected acute appendicitis at two different hospitals in two different countries. The first group of 200 patients at Ayub Teaching Hospital Abbottabad, Pakistan, was managed without preoperative ultrasonography. In the second group of 200 patients admitted at Najran General Hospital Najran Saudi Arabia, graded compression abdominal ultrasonography was routinely performed preoperatively. Diagnostic accuracy of the protocol in each group was measured statistically and rates of <b>negative</b> appendicectomy and <b>perforation</b> were determined. Results: Addition of routine ultrasonography in clinical assessment for acute appendicitis decreases the sensitivity but significantly increases the specificity of the protocol thereby reducing the false positive rate translating into decreased negative appendicectomy rate. Rate of negative appendicectomy was 22. 5 % in group one and 4. 7 % in group two. Perforation rate was 15. 6 % in group 1 and 15 % in group two. Conclusion: Proper clinical assessment is the mainstay of diagnosis in acute appendicitis and addition of routine ultrasound by graded compression technique can improve the diagnostic accuracy and adverse outcome...|$|R
40|$|Background: One of the {{unfavorable}} {{outcomes of}} endodontic treatment in primary molars is furcal perforation. During treatment, bacterial infection {{at the site}} of perforation should be prevented for better prognosis. Aim: This study aims to compare sealing ability of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) Plus™ and Biodentine™ for the repair of furcal perforation in primary molars using spectrophotometry. Materials and Methods: Access opening was done for all ninety extracted teeth. Perforation was made in furcation area in all the teeth. The sample size consisted of ninety extracted teeth. They were divided into four groups, Group 1 (n = 30) in which perforations were repaired with MTA Plus™, Group 2 (n = 30) in which perforations were repaired with Biodentine™. The other two groups were considered as control groups, Group 3 (n = 15) in which perforations were left unsealed (positive control) and Group 4 (n = 15) without <b>perforations</b> (<b>negative</b> control). Dye extraction method was used to compare the sealing ability of MTA Plus™ and Biodentine™. Statistical analysis was done using ANOVA test to compare the mean between the different groups. Intergroup comparison was performed using post hoc Scheffe test. Results: The highest dye absorbance was seen in the positive control group with a mean value of 0. 080 ± 0. 033. The mean value of MTA Plus™ was 0. 031 ± 0. 026 and Biodentine™ was 0. 024 ± 0. 031.

40|$|The {{impact of}} lower {{body mass index}} (BMI) on {{appendicitis}} has never been addressed. We investigated whether different BMIs affect the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} appendicitis in children. The correlation between BMI and diagnosis accuracy and treatment quality was evaluated by retrospective analysis of 457 children diagnosed with appendicitis. Based on BMI percentiles, patients were classified as either underweight (n = 36), normal weight (n = 346), overweight (n = 59), or obese (n = 16). Diagnosis accuracy was measured by <b>negative</b> appendectomy rate, <b>perforation</b> rate, and number of consultations. Treatment quality was measured by complication rate and length of hospital stay. Underweight patients had the highest negative appendectomy (OR 3. 00, P = 0. 008) and complication (OR 2. 75, P = 0. 041) rate. BMI did not influence perforation rate or number of consultations. Both underweight and obese patients stayed in the hospital longer than normal weight patients (regression coefficient 2. 34, P = 0. 001, and regression coefficient 9. 40, P < 0. 001, respectively). Furthermore, in obese patients, the hospital stay after open appendectomy was prolonged compared to laparoscopic appendectomy (P < 0. 001). No such differences were observed in patients with lower BMI. Underweight children are misdiagnosed more often, stay in hospital longer, and experience more postoperative complications than children of normal weight. Obesity is associated with longer hospital stays. Laparoscopic appendectomy might shorten the length of hospital stays in these patients. We conclude that in addition to obesity, underweight should also be considered a risk factor for children with appendicitis...|$|R
