40|$|Abstract—The {{electrothermal}} {{behavior of}} single- and two-finger bipolar transistors at medium- and high-current operations is studied through theoretical modeling, experimental measure-ments, and computer simulations.

40|$|Strain qualitatively {{changes the}} {{low-energy}} band structure of bilayer graphene, {{leading to the}} appearance of a pair of low-energy Dirac cones near each corner of the Brillouin zone, and a Lifshitz transition (a saddle point in the dispersion relation) at an energy proportional to the strain [Mucha-Kruczynski, Aleiner and Fal'ko Phys. Rev. B 84 041404 (2011) ]. Here, we show that {{in the vicinity of the}} Lifshitz transition, the conductance of a ballistic n-p and <b>n-p-n</b> <b>junction</b> exhibits an anomaly: a nonmonotonic temperature and chemical potential dependence, with the size depending on the crystallographic orientation of the principal axis of the strain tensor. This effect is characteristic for junctions between regions of different polarity (n-p and <b>n-p-n</b> <b>junctions),</b> while there is no anomaly in junctions between regions of the same polarity (n-n′ and n-n′-n junctions) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} study of quantum resonances in the ballistic transport of graphene based <b>N-P-N</b> <b>junction</b> subject to an externally applied electromagnetic field (EF). By {{making use of}} the Floquet analysis and the quasi-classical approach we analyze the dynamics of electrons {{in the presence of}} time and coordinate dependent potential U(z,t). In the absence of EF the resonant tunneling results in a set of sharp resonances in the dependence of dc conductance σ on the gate voltage V_g. In irradiated <b>N-P-N</b> <b>junctions</b> we obtain the Fano-type resonances in the dependence of σ(V_g). This coherent quantum-mechanical phenomenon is due to the interplay of two effects: the resonant tunneling through quasi-bound states and the quantum-interference effect in the region between the "resonant points", where the resonant absorption (emission) of photons occurs, and junction interfaces.
