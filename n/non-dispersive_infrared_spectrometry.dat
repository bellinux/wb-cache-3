Using a steady-state approach, endogenous glucose production was calculated as {{the difference between the}} rate of appearance of stable, non-radioactively labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 - 13 C 6 -glucose during continuous intravenous isotope infusion minus the exogenous glucose infusion rate after gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assessment of plasma isotope enrichment. Direct, aerobic glucose oxidation was derived from the mixed expiratory 13 CO 2 isotope enrichment measured using <b>non-dispersive</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>spectrometry</b> and corrected for the plasma isotope ratio and CO 2 production [23, 28].

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to compare the {{performance}} of isotope-selective <b>non-dispersive</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>spectrometry</b> (IRIS) for the 13 C-urea breath test with {{the combination of the}} 14 C-urea breath test (14 C-UBT), urease test and histologic examination for the diagnosis of H. pylori (HP) infection. Fifty-three duodenal ulcer patients were studied. All patients were submitted to gastroscopy to detect HP by the urease test, histologic examination and 14 C-UBT. To be included in the study the results of the 3 tests had to be concordant. Within one month after admission to the study the patients were submitted to IRIS with breath samples collected before and 30 min after the ingestion of 75 mg 13 C-urea dissolved in 200 ml of orange juice. The samples were mailed and analyzed 11. 5 (4 - 21) days after collection. Data were analyzed statistically by the chi-square and Mann-Whitney test and by the Spearman correlation coefficient. Twenty-six patients were HP positive and 27 negative. There was 100 % agreement between the IRIS results and the HP status determined by the other three methods. Using a cutoff value of delta-over-baseline (DOB) above 4. 0 the IRIS showed a mean value of 19. 38 (minimum = 4. 2, maximum = 41. 3, SD = 10. 9) for HP-positive patients and a mean value of 0. 88 (minimum = 0. 10, maximum = 2. 5, SD = 0. 71) for negative patients. Using a cutoff value corresponding to 0. 800 % CO 2 /weight (kg), the 14 C-UBT showed a mean value of 2. 78 (minimum = 0. 89, maximum = 5. 22, SD = 1. 18) in HP-positive patients. HP-negative patients showed a mean value of 0. 37 (minimum = 0. 13, maximum = 0. 77, SD = 0. 17). IRIS is a low-cost, easy to manage, highly sensitive and specific test for H. pylori detection.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} of this work {{was to assess the}} reliability of a newly developed FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy) technique for 13 C-urea breath test in the non-invasive diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection, in comparison to those currently used, isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) and <b>non-dispersive</b> isotope-selective <b>infrared</b> <b>spectrometry</b> (NDIRS). This new methodology is based on the use of a very less expensive and sophisticated FTIR than IRMS and NDIRS. Materials and Methods: Sixty patients (male and female, aged between 15 e 70 years) with dyspeptic symptoms, like the epigastric pain, were tested for H. pylori infection using 13 C-urea breath test. Triplicate breath samples were collected before and 30 min after drinking the test solution (75 mg 13 C-urea dissolved in 200 ml 0. 1 M citric acid). Analysis of d 13 C were conducted in parallel by means of IRMS, NDIRS and FTIR in order to compare the results. Results: Delta-over-baseline values were over 5 & in 18 patients, ranging from 8. 81 to 60. 88 & for IRMS measurements, from 7. 2 to 61. 2 & for NDIRS and from 7. 7 to 61. 2 & for FTIR measurements. The remaining 42 subjects had values well below the 5 & cut-off. The results of the baseline-corrected 13 CO 2 exhalation values between FTIR and IRMS/NDIRS were in good agreement. Conclusions: The newly developed FTIR methodology has been demonstrated to be a reliable and accurate analytical tool, low cost and easy-to-operate, which permits a highly specific measurement of 13 C enrichment in breath samples.
