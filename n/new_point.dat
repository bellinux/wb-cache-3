5|$|On September 8, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center {{predicted}} that Gustav would approach the North Carolina coast, {{and issued a}} tropical storm watch from Cape Fear to the North Carolina – Virginia border. The tropical storm watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning on September 9, and a new tropical storm watch was issued later that day for areas of southeastern Virginia, from the North Carolina – Virginia border to <b>New</b> <b>Point</b> Comfort. The new watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning on September 10. As Gustav began {{to turn to the}} northeast and away from the Mid-Atlantic coast, the tropical storm warnings were gradually discontinued. The last warning was discontinued on September 11.|$|E
5|$|The <b>new</b> <b>point</b> {{system for}} the general {{classification}} was met with some resistance as many people were very confused by how the new system operated or simply preferred the original system the organizers had used in years past. In response to the confusion surrounding the general classification format, the race organizers released a supplement to help better explain how the new points system operated. A La Stampa writer claimed that the supplement provided several lengthy example calculations and stated that they would know after the first stage how successful this new system will be.|$|E

5|$|The worm {{starts at}} some point of an {{infinite}} triangular grid. It starts moving along {{one of the six}} gridlines that meet at each point and, once it has travelled one unit of distance, it arrives at a <b>new</b> <b>point.</b> The worm then decides, based on the distribution of traversed and untraversed gridlines, what direction it will take. The directions are relative to the worm's point of view. If the worm has not encountered this exact distribution before it may leave along any untraversed gridline. From then on, if it encounters that distribution again, it must move in the same way. If there are no untraversed gridlines available, the worm dies and the simulation ends.|$|E

5|$|According to Keisuke Iwata, {{the global}} spread of Japanese {{animation}} dramatically expanded {{due to the}} popularity of Evangelion. After {{the success of the}} show, otaku culture gained wide attention. In Japan, Evangelion prompted a review of the cultural value of anime, and with its success, anime reached a <b>new</b> <b>point</b> of maturity. With the interest in the series, otaku culture became a mass social phenomenon. The show's regular reruns increased the number of otaku, which John Lynden links to a boom in interest in literature on the Dead Sea Scrolls, Kabbalah and Christianity. Anime director Makoto Shinkai declared that the genre of anime owes a cinematographic debt to Evangelion. In the aftermath of Evangelion, Anno reused many of its stylistic conceits in the live-action Love & Pop and the anime romance Kare Kano. Neon Genesis Evangelion also influenced some music artists, such as the UK band Fightstar and its debut album, Grand Unification, and the Japanese band Rey, which derived its name from the character of Rei Ayanami.|$|E

25|$|For example, {{starting}} {{with just two}} distinct points, we can create a line or either of two circles (in turn, using each point as centre and passing through the other point).

The maximum metric corresponds to a machine that adjusts both co-ordinates simultaneously, so the time to move to a <b>new</b> <b>point</b> is the slower of the two movements.|$|E

In these cases, lighthouses are placed below clifftop to ensure that they can still be seen at the surface during periods of fog or low clouds, as at Point Reyes Lighthouse.
