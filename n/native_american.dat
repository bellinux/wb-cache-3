5|$|According to the 2010 census, the {{population}} of the city was 65,870. The population density was 831.9 people per square mile (321.2/km²). There were 26,254 housing units at an average density of 336.5 per square mile (129.9/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 73.4% White, 1.9% Black or African American, 11.7% <b>Native</b> <b>American,</b> 1.9% Asian, 0.2% Pacific Islander, 7.3% from other races, and 3.6% from two or more races. 18.4% of {{the population}} were Hispanics or Latinos of any race. The city's African American population is considerably lower than the U.S. average (1.9% versus 12.6%), while the <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> population is markedly higher (11.7% vs. 0.9%). This is primarily attributable to the city's proximity to several <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> reservations, including the Navajo, Hopi, Havasupai, and Yavapai. Flagstaff's <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> community is chiefly Navajo, and there are about 5,500 people of Navajo ancestry living in the city.|$|E

50|$|The phrase originated, {{according}} to researcher David Wilton, {{in a cultural}} misunderstanding that arose when Europeans first encountered <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> on arriving in North America in the 15th century.

5|$|Pontiac's War has {{traditionally}} been portrayed as a defeat for the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> but scholars now usually {{view it as a}} military stalemate: while the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> had failed to drive away the British, the British were unable to conquer the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> Negotiation and accommodation, rather than success on the battlefield, ultimately brought an end to the war. The <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> had in fact won a victory of sorts by compelling the British government to abandon Amherst's policies and instead create a relationship with the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> modeled on the Franco-Native alliance.|$|R
5|$|According to the New England Historical Genealogical Society, {{several members}} of Warren's {{maternal}} family claim Cherokee heritage; the Society found a family newsletter that alluded to a marriage license application that listed Elizabeth Warren’s great-great-great grandmother as a Cherokee, but {{could not find the}} primary document and found no proof of Warren's <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> heritage. The Oklahoma Historical Society stated that finding a definitive answer about <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> heritage can be difficult because of intermarriage and deliberate avoidance of registration. Some members of the Cherokee Nation protested her claim to <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> ancestry and questioned whether she benefitted from it. Former colleagues and supervisors at the universities where she had worked (including Charles Fried, former Solicitor General under President Ronald Reagan) said Warren's ancestry was either not mentioned, or played no role in her hiring.|$|E

5000|$|As {{colonization}} {{continued in}} the U.S., groups were separated into categories like [...] "Christians" [...] and [...] "civilized" [...] against [...] "heathen" [...] and [...] "savage".

[...] <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> were viewed as unable to resist or handle alcohol.
