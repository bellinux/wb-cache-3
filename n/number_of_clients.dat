25|$|Warnecke {{opened an}} office in New York City in 1967, hiring noted architects Eugene Kohn in 1967 and Sheldon Fox in 1972. By 1977, his company, John Carl Warnecke & Associates, was the largest {{architectural}} firm in the United States. In 1976, Kohn left the firm after Warnecke refused him partnership, taking vice-president and designer William Pedersen, manager Sheldon Fox, and a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> with him and founding Kohn Pedersen Fox. Several Warnecke associates subsequently joined KPF, and when Warnecke's company subsequently languished, he began reducing his active involvement in his architectural practice. Warnecke purposely downsized his firm as he approached retirement, not wishing for his firm to continue after his death.|$|E

This study investigated the effect of light levels on client self-disclosure. The sample consisted <b>of</b> 30 women <b>clients</b> ranging in age from 18 - 29 who were students enrolled at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, IL. These clients were self-referred or recruited from courses in the field of human services, and received counseling at the Counseling Laboratory located in Graham Hall. Counselors who participated in the study were part of a master's level practicum class. Counseling sessions were conducted in low or high light levels. The effect of light levels was examined by the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>client</b> "I" statements, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> words spoken by the <b>client,</b> and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>client</b> affective words. A semantic differential that measured <b>client</b> attitude <b>of</b> the counseling session was completed by clients {{at the end of the}} second counseling session. To obtain the necessary client self-disclosure, a 10 -minute segment of the second counseling session was audio taped. The 10 -minute segment corresponded to the 20 - 30 minute segment of an hour-long session. The audio tape was then transcribed by the experimenter using a transcription machine and computer. Tabulation <b>of</b> the <b>client</b> self-disclosure measures was accomplished using the "search to count words" function that was part of the 1986 computer software program IBM Writing Assistant Version 2. 0. Client self-disclosure data was analyzed using Analysis of Co-Variance, while semantic differential data was analyzed using t-tests. Results indicated that light levels had no effect on <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>client</b> "I" statements, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>client</b> words, and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>client</b> affective words. <b>Client</b> attitude <b>of</b> the counseling setting was also not influenced by light levels based on semantic differential results...|$|R

A lord not only had greater ability, but also needed to take greater steps to preserve their honour, lest they lose their lordship. The order of lords varies, but in Críth Gablach it is as follows: aire déso (lord of vassals), aire ard (high lord), aire tuíseo (lord of precedence), and the aire forgill (lord of superior testimony).|$|E

30|$|The {{reason for}} the much lower <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>client</b> {{transfers}} in the SPS compared to SG- 1 is as follows: the SPS selects peers with the highest capacity among its neighbors to be super-peer candidates and then picks up super-peers from the super-peer candidates. Thus, {{only a small portion}} of super-peers change their roles to be a client peer and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> transferred <b>client</b> peers (because <b>of</b> role change of these super-peers) is low. However, in SG- 1, one peer exchanges gossip messages with randomly selected neighbors to decide whether it keeps the role of super-peer or changes its role to be a client peer. Thus, one peer could frequently change its role when it compares its capacity with different neighbors. Consequently, client peers managed by these super-peers generate a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>client</b> peer transfers.|$|R
500|$|During {{a typical}} {{psychodrama}} session, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> gather together. [...] One of these clients is {{chosen by the}} group as the protagonist, and the director calls on the other clients to assist the protagonist's [...] "performance," [...] either by portraying other characters, or by utilizing mirroring, doubling, or role reversal. [...] The clients act {{out a number of}} scenes in order to allow the protagonist to work through certain scenarios. [...] This is obviously beneficial for the protagonist, but also is helpful to the other group members, allowing them to assume the role of another person and apply that experience to their own life. [...] The focus during the session is on the acting out of different scenarios, rather than simply talking through them. [...] All of the different elements of the session (stage, props, lighting, etc.) are used to heighten the reality of the scene.|$|E
500|$|Neither Greek nor Latin had a word {{corresponding}} to modern-day [...] "family". The Latin familia must be translated to [...] "household" [...] rather than [...] "family". The aristocratic household of ancient Rome {{was similar to}} that of medieval Europe, in that it consisted [...] in addition to the paterfamilias, his wife and children [...] of a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> (clientes), or dependents of the lord who would attend upon him, counsel him and receive rewards. Where it differed from its medieval equivalent was in the use of slaves rather than paid servants for the performance of menial tasks. Another difference was that, due to the relative security and peacefulness within the borders of the Roman Empire, there was little need for fortification. The aristocratic household of medieval Europe, on the other hand, was as much a military as a socio-economic unit, and from the 9th century onwards the ideal residence was the castle.|$|E
500|$|A common {{complaint}} regarding street prostitution was {{the foul}} language used, and while generally most {{entries in the}} lists look favourably on those women who refrained from swearing, the views expressed in the 1793 edition of Harris's List tend towards equivocation. [...] Mrs Cornish's genteel nature was, on occasion, interrupted by [...] "a volley of small shot", and Miss Johnson's proclivity towards [...] "vulgarity of expression and a coarseness of manner" [...] apparently suffered no shortage of admirers. [...] Mrs Russell, attractive to [...] "a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> among the youth, who are fond of beholding that mouth of the devil from whence all corruption issueth", was admired for her [...] "vulgarity more than any thing else, she being extremely expert at uncommon oaths". [...] Drinking, intrinsically linked with prostitution, was also frowned on. [...] Mrs William's entry of 1773 is full of remorse, her having returned home [...] "so intoxicated {{so as not to}} be able to stand, to the no small amusement of her neighbors", and Miss Jenny Kirbeard had, in 1788, a [...] "violent attachment to drinking". [...] Not all entries were disapproving though; Mrs Harvey would, in 1793, [...] "often toss off a sparkling bumper," [...] while remaining [...] "a lady of great sensibility... not a little clever in the performance of the act of friction." [...] More generally, most entries are flattering, although some are less than complimentary; the 1773 listing for Miss Berry denounces her as [...] "almost rotten, and her breath cadaverous". [...] Prostitutes may have paid money to appear in the lists, and in Denlinger's view such commentary may indicate a degree of annoyance on the writer's part, the women concerned perhaps having refused to pay. [...] Some listings also imply a degree of dissatisfaction on the part of the customer; in the 1773 edition, Miss Dean exhibited [...] "great indifference" [...] while entertaining her client, busying herself by cracking nuts while he was [...] "acting his joys". [...] Others are scorned for wearing too much makeup, and some for being [...] "lazy bedfellows". [...] A popular view that prostitutes were licentious, hot-blooded and hungry for sex was incompatible with the knowledge that most worked for money, and the lists therefore criticise women whose demands for payment appeared a little too mercenary.|$|E

She was then to add that their marriage, after what she had discovered, was a simple impossibility--and she was to put it to him, whether he thought it wisest to secure her silence by falling in with her views, or to force her, by opposing them, to make the motive under which she was acting generally known. If he attempted to defend himself, or to deny the facts, she was, in that event, to refer him to ME.|$|E
