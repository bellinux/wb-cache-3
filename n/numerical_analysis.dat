5|$|A major {{branch of}} <b>numerical</b> <b>analysis</b> {{is devoted to}} the {{development}} of efficient algorithms for matrix computations, a subject that is centuries old and is today an expanding area of research. Matrix decomposition methods simplify computations, both theoretically and practically. Algorithms that are tailored to particular matrix structures, such as sparse matrices and near-diagonal matrices, expedite computations in finite element method and other computations. Infinite matrices occur in planetary theory and in atomic theory. A simple example of an infinite matrix is the matrix representing the derivative operator, which acts on the Taylor series of a function.|$|E
5|$|Richardson {{envisioned a}} large {{auditorium}} {{of thousands of}} people performing the calculations and passing them to others. However, the sheer number of calculations required was too large to be completed without the use of computers, {{and the size of the}} grid and time steps led to unrealistic results in deepening systems. It was later found, through <b>numerical</b> <b>analysis,</b> that this was due to numerical instability. The first computerised weather forecast was performed by a team composed of American meteorologists Jule Charney, Philip Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist Ragnar Fjørtoft, applied mathematician John von Neumann, and ENIAC programmer Klara Dan von Neumann. Practical use of numerical weather prediction began in 1955, spurred by the development of programmable electronic computers.|$|E

He joined the faculty at Stanford University in 1974 first as an associate professor and then later as full professor. In 1982, he joined the faculty of Virginia Tech as a professor of civil engineering and served as head of their Department of Civil Engineering for seven years. In 1990, Clough became dean of the Virginia Tech College of Engineering. Clough continued his research and instruction of graduate students at Virginia Tech in addition to his administrative responsibilities. Clough's research focused on geotechnical engineering, including earthquake studies, <b>numerical</b> <b>analysis,</b> soil structure interaction, in-situ testing, and underground openings. In 1993, he became provost and vice president for academic affairs at the University of Washington. Clough cofounded the United States Universities Council of Geotechnical Engineering Research (USUCGER), and served as the organization's first president during 1993.|$|E

In the <b>numerical</b> limit <b>analysis,</b> once the stress or displacement/velocity fields are approximated and the bound theorems are applied, the limit analysis becomes a problem of optimization involving either linear programing (LP) or nonlinear programming (NLP) which can be solved respectively by the available LP or NLP algorithms [16 – 23].|$|R

40|$|Abstract-Traditional {{satellite}} scatterometer wind retrieval algorithms {{consist of}} point-wise wind estimation and pointwise ambiguity removal. Point-wise estimation yields multiple estimates, or ambiguities, {{for the average}} near-surface ocean wind in each scatterometer resolution element, requiring subsequent ambiguity removal. Even though some point-wise ambiguity removal techniques achieve a high skill, they are still subject to error and usually rely on <b>numerical</b> model <b>analysis</b> fields. An alternative to point-wise wind retrieval, {{one that does not}} rely on <b>numerical</b> model <b>analysis</b> fields, is fieldwise or model-based retrieval.
