5|$|Anderson {{scored the}} first penalty in sudden death. Kalou then sent Van der Sar {{the wrong way}} to make it 5–5. Giggs was <b>next</b> <b>up</b> and he was also successful. Van der Sar then pulled off the crucial save for United; he pointed to his left to {{indicate}} to Nicolas Anelka that he thought he would kick to that side, as had the six players who had kicked before him, only to correctly dive to his right to deny Anelka, whose kick was at a good height to be saved, securing European football's top prize for United {{for the third time in}} their history.|$|E
5|$|As {{the match}} went to penalties, Rio Ferdinand won the coin toss for Manchester United, and opted for his side {{to go first}} in the shoot-out, which would be taken at the end housing the Manchester United fans. Tevez stepped up first and sent Čech the wrong way. Ballack was <b>next</b> <b>up,</b> {{shooting}} powerfully past Van der Sar. Carrick buried his spot-kick, as did Juliano Belletti with his first touch of the game, having come on for Makélélé {{at the end of}} extra time. The first miss of the shoot-out came from Ronaldo, who characteristically stuttered in his run-up in an attempt to put Čech off, but the goalkeeper dived to his right to save.|$|E
5|$|Lampard {{then put}} Chelsea 3–2 ahead, but Hargreaves {{levelled}} {{things up with}} a shot into the top corner. Ashley Cole was the <b>next</b> <b>up,</b> and Van der Sar got a strong hand to the ball but could not keep it out. Nani then {{knew he had to}} score to keep United in it, and he did, leaving it up to John Terry to win the cup for Chelsea; however, Terry lost his footing when planting his standing foot by the ball, and, even though Van der Sar was sent the wrong way, Terry's mis-hit effort struck the outside of the right post and went wide.|$|E

Monteiro continued {{to perform well}} as a starter in replacing Melquan Bolding, leading the team with 21 points. <b>Next</b> <b>up</b> for the team was the annual City Game match-up between Duquesne and its crosstown rival Pitt. In front of 12,336fans at the Mellon Arena, Duquesne sprang out to a 16-point lead before slipping and losing 58–67 in double overtime.

5|$|Werder Bremen were <b>next</b> <b>up</b> in the quarter-finals. Goals apiece by Thierry Henry and Fredrik Ljungberg {{helped them}} to a 2–0 victory at home.

5|$|In 2010, {{the team}} ended their {{association}} with Radical, and replaced the SR9 with a LM P2 class Ginetta-Zytek GZ09S/2; Tim Greaves, Karim Ojjeh and Thor-Christian Ebbesvik were named as the team's regular drivers, resulting in the team being known as Team Bruichladdich. The team's first race with the car came at the LMS opener, the 8 Hours of Castellet, and they finished twelfth overall, fifth in class. The 1000km of Spa proved to be less successful; the team suffered a blown engine during qualifying, and Ebbesvik crashed {{out of the race}} after 15 laps. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Gary Chalandon replaced Ebbesvik, and the team finished tenth overall, fifth in the LM P2 class. <b>Next</b> <b>up</b> was the 1000km of Algarve, and Ebbesvik returned to the team; fifth overall, and second in class, for their first class podium of the season. The 1000 km of Hungaroring saw another fifth place overall, although mechanical difficulties with the LM P1-class cars meant that this also equated to fifth in class. The season finale, which was the 1000km of Silverstone, saw the team end the season with a 19th overall, and eighth in class. The team finished the season ranked fifth in the LMP2 Team's Championship, with 46 points.|$|E
