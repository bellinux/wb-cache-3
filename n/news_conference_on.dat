50|$|When Woodrow Wilson {{was elected}} Governor of New Jersey in 1910, he asked Joseph P. Tumulty {{to serve as}} his Private Secretary. When he was elected {{president}} two years later, he brought Tumulty {{with him to the}} White House, where Tumulty served as Private Secretary to the President. As private secretary, Tumulty dealt extensively with the press. At the outset of the administration, Tumulty convinced Wilson, who was known for his distaste of the press, to hold <b>news</b> <b>conferences</b> <b>on</b> a regularized schedule, sometimes as much as twice every week. During the first such <b>news</b> <b>conference,</b> over one hundred reporters crowded into Wilson's office to ask him questions. Wilson often requested that reporters not publish answers given in these settings and on one occasion threatened to cancel the <b>news</b> <b>conferences</b> when a reporter revealed comments he had given regarding Mexico. The press conferences were later discontinued after the sinking of British liner Lusitania, and despite attempts to revive them during his second term were held only sporadically during Wilson's final years in office.|$|R

25|$|Peter R. Orszag, {{the then}} {{director}} of the CBO, argued in June 2008 that the Medicare program as currently structured is unsustainable without significant reform, as tax revenues dedicated to the program are not sufficient to cover its rapidly increasing expenditures. According to the CBO, spending on Medicare will grow from $485 billion during 2009 to $879 billion by 2018. President Obama said at a White House <b>news</b> <b>conference</b> <b>on</b> July 22 that, without changes, the system is guaranteed “to basically break the federal budget”.

500|$|There {{was much}} {{improvisation}} in dialogue scenes, because the script was not completed when filming began (the filmmakers had {{focused on the}} story making sense and planning the action). Favreau felt that improvisation would make the film feel more natural. Some scenes were shot with two cameras to capture lines said on the spot. Multiple takes were done, as Downey wanted {{to try something new}} each time. It was Downey's idea to have Stark hold a <b>news</b> <b>conference</b> <b>on</b> the floor, and he created the speech Stark makes when demonstrating the Jericho weapon. Bridges described this approach as [...] "a $200 million student film", and noted that it caused stress for Marvel executives when the stars were {{trying to come up with}} dialogue on the day of filming scenes. He also noted that in some instances, he and Downey would swap characters for rehearsal to see how their own lines sounded. The dialogue for the Nick Fury cameo scene was also changed on set, with comic writer Brian Michael Bendis providing three pages of dialogue for the part, and the filmmakers choosing the best lines for filming on set. The Nick Fury cameo was filmed with a skeleton crew in order to keep it a secret, but rumors appeared on the Internet only days later. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige subsequently had the scene removed from all preview prints in order to maintain the surprise and keep fans guessing.|$|E
