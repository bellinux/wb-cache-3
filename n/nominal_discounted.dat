40|$|In the "positive interest" {{models of}} Flesaker-Hughston, the <b>nominal</b> <b>discount</b> bond system is {{determined}} by a one-parameter family of positive martingales. In the present paper we extend this analysis to include a variety of distributions for the martingale family, parameterised by a function that determines the behaviour of the market risk premium. These distributions include jump and diffusion characteristics that generate various properties for discount bond returns. For example, one can generate skewness and excess kurtosis in the bond returns by choosing the martingale family to be given by (a) exponential gamma processes, or (b) exponential variance gamma processes. The models are "rational" {{in the sense that}} the discount bond price is given by a ratio of weighted sums of positive martingales. Our findings lead to semi-analytical formulae for the prices of options on discount bonds. A number of general results concerning Lévy interest rate models are presented as well. ...|$|R

We consider a set of continuous- time information processes that describe {{the flow of information}} about market factors in a monetary economy. The nominal pricing kernel is at any given time assumed to be given by a function of the values of information processes at that time. By use of a change-of-measure technique we derive explicit expressions for the price processes of nom- inal discount bonds, and deduce the associated dynamics of the short rate of interest and the market price of risk. The interest rate positiv- ity condition is expressed as a differential inequality. We proceed to the modelling of the price-level, which at any given time is also taken to be a function of the values of the information processes at that time.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I analyze a simple "representative agent" {{exchange}} model of general equilibrium, and derive closed form solutions for returns on stocks and real and nominal bonds. The model restricts the representative agent's utility function to be time-separable with isoelastic period utility, and the endowment to be conditionally lognormal. These assumptions {{allow me to}} examine a general stationary stochastic process for the log of the endowment. Money and nominal prices are modelled {{by means of a}} Clower constraint. Risk premia on stocks and real and <b>nominal</b> <b>discount</b> bonds are simple functions of the coefficient of relative risk aversion, the variance of the innovation to the log endowment, and the weights in the moving average representation of the log endowment. One-period holding premia on real bonds may be positive or negative, but the limit as maturity increases is positive. When the money supply is deterministic, stocks and nominal bonds are perfect substitutes. Their expected returns to maturity are higher than those on real bonds of equal maturity, but need not be higher over other holding periods. Nominal interest rates vary positively with prices (the "Gibson paradox") if the coefficient of relative risk aversion is greater than one. In the last section of the paper I consider random shocks to the agent's utility function. These shocks may generate risk premia even when the agent is risk-neutral. ...|$|R
40|$|Monthly term {{structures}} are fit to US Treasury inflation-indexed securities using a QN (Quadratic-Natural) spline, developed in this paper, {{and also to}} conventional nominal securities of comparable maturities. The ratio of the real to <b>nominal</b> <b>discount</b> functions is an implicit forward CPI function. The difference between the nominal and real forward interest rate curves is an implicit marginal inflation premium. It is demonstrated that under consumption risk-neutrality per Stanley Fischer (1975), this inflation premium does not equal expected future inflation per Irving Fisher (1896, 1930), but rather incorporates a weighted average of expectations about the future course of inflation, that tends to give greater weight to low inflation scenarios than to high. The method is applied to 29 dates since {{the introduction of the}} 30 -year indexed bond in April 1998. Nominal interest rate volatility is 2 - 2. 5 times greater (in terms of standard deviation) than real interest rate volatility, nominal rate shocks are highly correlated with shocks to the inflation premium, and real interest rate shocks are nearly orthogonal to inflation premium shocks. To date, there is no evidence against the log expectations hypothesis for real interest rates, nor against the Fisher hypothesis for the inflation premium. There is only weak evidence against the Fischer ypothesis. No evidence is found that the estimated forward rate beyond 30 years is nondecreasing over time, or even has lessened variance, despite the argument of Dybvig, Ingersoll and Ross (1996) that the asymptotic long-term forward rate and zero-coupon rate cannot fall without generating arbitrage opportunities.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new approach to}} model the market smile for inflation-linked derivatives by defining the Quadratic Gaussian Year-on-Year inflation model—the QGY model. We directly define the model in terms of a year-on-year ratio of the inflation index on a discrete tenor structure, which, along with the <b>nominal</b> <b>discount</b> bond, is driven by a log-quadratic function of a multi-factor Gaussian Markov process. We find closed-form expressions for the drift of the inflation index and for inflation-linked swaps. We get a Black-Scholes-type pricing formula for year-on-year inflation caplets in semi-analytical form. The formula contains an integral of a multivariate Gaussian density over a quadratic domain. In a two-dimensional case, we show how this integral reduces to a one-dimensional integration along the boundary of a conic section. In the case where the year-on-year inflation ratio is driven by two factors, we specify a spherical parameterisation. This gives an intuitive control over the curvature and the skew of the year-on-year inflation smile and shows the maximum curvature and skew obtainable with a particular three-factor version of the QGY model. Within this three-factor model, we identify a parameterisation to control the autocorrelation structure of the inflation index. We calibrate the model to year-on-year inflation options on the UK’s Retail Prices Index (RPI) and the eurozone’s Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices Excluding Tobacco (HICPxT) and get a good fit to the smile of implied volatilities. We use the calibrated model to price HICPxT zero-coupon inflation options and RPI limited price indices (LPIs). Furthermore, we provide methods to interpolate the process for the inflation index and the year-on-year inflation ratio between dates on the tenor structure.

The settlers were provided 1. 21 ha/ 299. 51 acres degraded forestland with full input support. The current study examined the fi nancial viability of the farms, including homesteads, based on this arrangement. The BCA approach was employed to determine the net incremental benefi t. It was found that a no-cost sharing arrangement option was fi nancially feasible. Sensitivity analysis showed that the NPV is sensitive to the cost items of the program.

The impact effect on real interest rates is shown to depend upon the degree of credibility of the announcement. Real interest rates may fall if agents do not believe that taxes will be raised, and rise if the future tax reform is sufficiently credible.

40|$|The {{earnings}} yield, {{determined by}} the ratio of reported earnings to price, is frequently used to predict real return. Complications characterize the predictions, however, because reported earnings are not real. This research identifies an adjusted earnings yield that ensures that real return can be determined as a ratio of current-period prices. From freely accessible and publicly disseminated data, an adjusted-earnings-yield series is created for the U. S. equity market. Statistical tests indicate that this measure {{is a much better}} predictor of future real returns than are other popular valuation measures. wo correct methods are used for computing expected return. The first is to determine a <b>nominal</b> (inflation-affected) <b>discount</b> rate that equates the present value of the asset’s nominal expected cash flows to its price. The sec-ond is to remove the effect of inflationary expecta-tions on nominal cash flows and then determine a real discount rate that equates the present value of the asset’s real expected cash flows to price. Econ-omists frequently prefer the second method because real cash flows tend to be more stable and, therefore, easier to predict than their nominal coun-terparts. Investors should also focus on real expected returns because their typical concern is to improve purchasing power. Consistent with this line of reasoning, the earn-ings yield (the reciprocal of the P/E) is commonly labeled a reasonable approximation of the real expected return to equity (see Siegel 2005 for a recent example). To see why, assume that the market value of equity, S, can be estimated by using the constant-growth dividend discount model (DDM) of Gordon (1962) presented in Equation 1, where Div repre-sents dividends and where expected return, r, and dividend growth, g, are both assumed real: (1) Rearranging the terms in Equation 1 results i...|$|R

Example Setting: Hypothetical firm in an inflationary environment.

This technical note has six objectives: * illustrate how to construct a pro-forma financial statement, such as Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss Statement, and cash flow forecast for the new firm. * show how the financial evaluation of the firm as a project made with constant prices and/or constant dollar and real or deflated interest rates might differ from the evaluation of the same project with current or nominal prices. * suggest the conditions or assumptions that have to be met in order for the two approaches (the constant price approach and the current or nominal price approach) to give equal results (this is, identical NPV). * show which problems in the follow up and monitoring of a project might be present when working with the constant price approach. * illustrate why NPV calculated at constant prices and real or deflated rate of interest is, in general, different to the NPV calculated at current or <b>nominal</b> prices and <b>discounted</b> at <b>nominal</b> rates of interest, contrary to what is written in many financial textbooks. * describe how a spreadsheet might be utilized to make a more sophisticated analysis and avoid unnecessary, but widely-used oversimplifications. An Excel spreadsheet accompanies the note and allows students to conduct sensitivity analysis on the project's NPV and other results. ...|$|R
