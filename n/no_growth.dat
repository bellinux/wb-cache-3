In a narrowly decided vote, the NSAC committee showed a slight preference, based on non-science related considerations, for shutting down RHIC rather than canceling the construction of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB).|$|E
25|$|Choosing between {{investment}} projects {{will be based}} upon several inter-related criteria. (1) Corporate management seeks to maximize {{the value of the}} firm by investing in projects which yield a positive net present value when valued using an appropriate discount rate in consideration of risk. (2) These projects must also be financed appropriately. (3) If <b>no</b> <b>growth</b> is possible by the company and excess cash surplus is not needed to the firm, then financial theory suggests that management should return {{some or all of the}} excess cash to shareholders (i.e., distribution via dividends).|$|E

In terms of GDP per capita, India's per-capita income was lower than the Middle East from 1 CE (16% lower) to 1000 CE (about 40% lower), but by the late Delhi Sultanate era in 1500, India's GDP per capita had increased to being almost on-par with the Middle East.|$|E

25|$|In February 1996, Kaikō {{returned}} to Challenger Deep, this time collecting sediment and microorganisms from the seabed {{at a depth}} of 10,898 meters. Among the novel organisms identified and collected was Moritella yayanosii and Shewanella benthica. These two species of bacteria appear to be obligately barophilic. The optimal pressure conditions for growth of S. benthica is 70 Megapascals (MPa), while M. yayanosii grows best at 80 MPa; <b>no</b> <b>growth</b> at all was detected at pressures of less than 50 MPa with either strain. Both species appear to contain high levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), omega-3 fatty acids which could prove to be useful in the treatment of hypertension and even cancer.|$|E
25|$|The slow {{economic}} decline after 1730 was relative: other countries grew faster, eroding the Dutch lead and surpassing it. Wilson identifies three causes. Holland lost its world dominance in trade as competitors emerged and copied its practices, built their own ships and ports, and traded {{on their own}} account directly without going through Dutch intermediaries. Second, there was <b>no</b> <b>growth</b> in manufacturing, due perhaps to a weaker sense of industrial entrepreneurship and to the high wage scale. Third the wealthy turned their investments to foreign loans. This helped jump-start other nations and provided the Dutch with a steady income from collecting interest, but leaving them with few domestic sectors with a potential for rapid growth.|$|E
25|$|Capital {{budgeting}} is {{also concerned}} with the setting of criteria about which projects should receive investment funding to increase {{the value of the}} firm, and whether to finance that investment with equity or debt capital. Investments should be {{made on the basis of}} value-added to the future of the corporation. Projects that increase a firm's value may include a wide variety of different types of investments, including but not limited to, expansion policies, or mergers and acquisitions. When <b>no</b> <b>growth</b> or expansion is possible by a corporation and excess cash surplus exists and is not needed, then management is expected to pay out some or all of those surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends or to repurchase the company's stock through a share buyback program.|$|E

In another study, clinical outcomes were compared for 213 patients undergoing surgery vs. 351 patients under watchful observation.

25|$|According to a 1996 {{study by}} the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, on 8 of the 10 key {{economic}} variables examined, the American economy performed better during the Reagan years than during the pre- and post-Reagan years. Real median family income grew by $4,000 during the Reagan period after experiencing <b>no</b> <b>growth</b> in the pre-Reagan years; it experienced a loss of almost $1,500 in the post-Reagan years. Interest rates, inflation, and unemployment fell faster under Reagan than they did immediately before or after his presidency. The only economic variable that was lower during period than in both the pre- and post-Reagan years was the savings rate, which fell rapidly in the 1980s. The productivity rate was higher in the pre-Reagan years but lower in the post-Reagan years.|$|E
25|$|Individual lamellibranchid tube worms, {{the longer}} of two taxa found at seeps can reach lengths of 3nbsp&m (10nbsp&ft) and live {{hundreds}} of years (Fisher et al., 1997; Bergquist et al., 2000). Growth rates determined from recovered marked tube worms have been variable, ranging from <b>no</b> <b>growth</b> of 13 individuals measured one year to a maximum growth of 9.6nbsp&cm/yr (3.8 in/yr) in a Lamellibrachia individual (MacDonald, 2002). Average growth rate was 2.19nbsp&cm/yr (0.86 in/yr) for the Escarpia-like species and 2.92nbsp&cm/yr (1.15 in/yr) for lamellibrachids. These are slower growth rates than those of their hydrothermal vent relatives, but Lamellibrachia individuals can reach lengths 2–3 {{times that of the}} largest known hydrothermal vent species. Individuals of Lamellibrachia sp. in excess of 3nbsp&m (10nbsp&ft) have been collected on several occasions, representing probable ages in excess of 400 years (Fisher, 1995). Vestimentiferan tube worm spawning is not seasonal and recruitment is episodic.|$|E

2500|$|Seinfeld broke several {{conventions}} of mainstream television. The show offers <b>no</b> <b>growth</b> or reconciliation to its characters. It eschews sentimentality.

On the set, the notion that the characters should not develop or improve throughout the series was expressed as the [...] "no hugging, no learning" [...] rule. Also unlike most sitcoms, there are no moments of pathos; the audience is never made to feel sorry for any of the characters.

2500|$|According to the World Tourism Organization (WTO), {{international}} travel to Brazil {{began to grow}} fast since 2000, particularly during 2004 and 2005. However, in 2006 a slow down took place, and international arrivals have had almost <b>no</b> <b>growth</b> both in 2007 and 2008. In spite of this trend, revenues from international tourism continued to rise, from USD 3.9 billion in 2005 to USD 4.9 billion in 2007, a one billion dollar increase despite 333 thousand less arrivals. This favorable trend {{is the result of}} the strong devaluation of the American dollar against the Brazilian real, which began in 2004, but on the other hand, making Brazil a more expensive international destination. This trend changed in 2009, when both visitors and revenues fell as a result of the 2008-2009 economic crisis. By 2010 the industry recovered, and arrivals grew above 2006 levels to 5.16 million international visitors, and receipts from these visitors reached USD 5.9 billion.
