5|$|Work {{carried out}} in the 20th and 21st centuries {{included}} full cleaning of the stonework and the reconstruction of the pipe organ by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn. The stonework of the west front had been subject to <b>natural</b> <b>erosion</b> therefore a process of lime-based conservation was carried out during the 1990s by Nimbus Conservation under the guidance of Professor Robert Baker who had previously worked on the west front of Wells Cathedral. Some of the damage to sculptures had been made worse by the use of Portland cement by previous work {{carried out in}} the Victorian era. A statue of St Phillip was beyond repair and was removed and replaced with a modern statue by Laurence Tindall.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{following}} an appeal for help by Norodom Sihanouk, Angkor Wat was listed in UNESCO's World Heritage in Danger (later removed in 2004) and World Heritage Site {{together with an}} appeal by UNESCO {{to the international community}} to save Angkor. Zoning of the area was set up to protect the Angkor site in 1994, APSARA was established in 1995 to protect and manage the area, and a law to protect Cambodian heritage was passed in 1996. A number of countries such as France, Japan and China are currently involved in various Angkor Wat conservation projects. The German Apsara Conservation Project (GACP) is working to protect the devatas, and other bas-reliefs which decorate the temple, from damage. The organisation's survey found that around 20% of the devatas were in very poor condition, mainly because of <b>natural</b> <b>erosion</b> and deterioration of the stone but in part also due to earlier restoration efforts. Other work involves the repair of collapsed sections of the structure, and prevention of further collapse: the west facade of the upper level, for example, has been buttressed by scaffolding since 2002, while a Japanese team completed restoration of the north library of the outer enclosure in 2005. World Monuments Fund began conservation work on the Churning of the Sea of Milk Gallery in 2008 after several years of studies on its condition. The project restored the traditional Khmer roofing system and removed cement used in earlier restoration attempts that had resulted in salts entering the structure behind the bas-relief, discoloring and damaging the sculpted surfaces. The main phase of work ended in 2012, with the final component being the installation of finials {{on the roof of the}} gallery in 2013.|$|E
25|$|When <b>natural</b> <b>erosion</b> {{or human}} mining makes the ground {{too weak to}} support the {{structures}} built on it, the ground can collapse and produce a sinkhole. For example, the 2010 Guatemala City sinkhole which killed fifteen people was caused when heavy rain from Tropical Storm Agatha, diverted by leaking pipes into a pumice bedrock, led to the sudden collapse of the ground beneath a factory building.|$|E

25|$|The {{formation}} {{was created}} by the collapse of a sea cave, probably during the 19th century. It consisted of a pillar of rock rising from the sea and joined to the cliff by a horizontal slab. Following decades of <b>natural</b> <b>erosion</b> that caused parts of the arch to fall into the sea, the slab and pillar collapsed completely in stormy weather on 8 March 2017.|$|E
25|$|A cluster or {{necropolis}} of burial mounds, {{the so-called}} Hohmichele Group, is located 3.5km {{west of the}} Heuneburg. It consists of at least 36 burial mounds. The group is named after its largest mound, the Hohmichele. It is located near Altheim (Biberach district). Most of the mounds are not visible any more due to <b>natural</b> <b>erosion</b> and ploughing. The 14 or so that remain are located in forests.|$|E
25|$|While {{this idea}} excited the public, the astronomical {{community}} was skeptical. Many astronomers {{could not see}} these markings, and few {{believed that they were}} as extensive as Lowell claimed. As a result, Lowell and his observatory were largely ostracized. Although the consensus was that some actual features did exist which would account for these markings, in 1909 the sixty-inch Mount Wilson Observatory telescope in Southern California allowed closer observation of the structures Lowell had interpreted as canals, and revealed irregular geological features, probably the result of <b>natural</b> <b>erosion.</b>|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, it is {{extremely}} {{important to realize that}} shoreline changes induced by erosion and accretion are natural processes; 8 it makes part of the dynamic of the coast, but in Santos there is high evidence that urban-harbor-induced factors surpass <b>natural</b> coastal <b>erosion</b> in the entrance (Type 3 e 7) and along the estuary (Type 8). The development of harbor along the estuary of Santos within river catchments and watersheds (river damming and diversion) and offshore (dredging) in combination with these <b>natural</b> phenomena (<b>erosion</b> and accretion) often exacerbate coastal erosion in Ponta da Praia neighborhood (Type 3).|$|R

25|$|The Matterhorn {{acquired}} its characteristic pyramidal {{shape in}} much more recent times as it was caused by <b>natural</b> <b>erosion</b> over the past million years. At the beginning of alpine orogeny, the Matterhorn was only a rounded mountain like a hill. Because its height is above the snowline, its flanks are covered by ice, resulting from the accumulation and compaction of snow. During the warmer period of summer, part of the ice melts and seeps into the bedrock. When it freezes again, it fractures pieces of rock because of its dilatation (freeze-thaw), forming a cirque. Four cirques led {{to the shape of}} the mountain. Because of its recognizable shape, many other similar mountains around the world were named or nicknamed the 'Matterhorn' of their respective countries or mountain ranges.|$|E
500|$|The meteor {{crash site}} was filmed at a <b>natural</b> <b>erosion</b> site just outside Cardiff, which the {{location}} managers found by chance, and {{felt it was}} the perfect location for a crash site. The producers included an easter egg in the Torchwood Hub set by including the picture of Craig-y-Nos Castle, used as a location of Torchwood House in the Doctor Who episode [...] "Tooth and Claw"; in the end of the episode the Torchwood Institute was established by Queen Victoria. To film the scene where Gwen and Carys kiss, actresses Eve Myles and Sara Gregory discussed how they would execute it beforehand and agreed that they have to imagine Gregory as Johnny Depp, and Myles as Brad Pitt. To film the exploding rat sequence, episode director Brian Kelly filmed a rat in a cage, and then replace it with a fur covered condom filled with [...] "chicken bits" [...] and red dye to simulate guts, then exploded with a squib.|$|E
500|$|Hayes and Rutter {{state that}} the greater {{postulated}} portion of the structure beyond that visible on Wheeldale Moor is difficult to trace due to its having been greatly damaged {{over the years by}} <b>natural</b> <b>erosion,</b> which they state has completely destroyed some sections. The structure as a whole has also been greatly damaged both deliberately and inadvertently by humans: as Ward writes, it is often the fate of historic structures such as roads to have [...] "been levelled by the plough and plundered of their materials". There are specific mentions of damage to the causeway through ploughing, tree felling, the laying of water mains, attempts to clear vegetation and even, in the twentieth century, by the activity of both tracked [...] and armoured vehicles. The structure has also been heavily and deliberately robbed of stone for use in local construction, such as roads, dry-stone walls, dikes and farm buildings, this robbing continuing from 1586 through to at least the early twentieth century. Young, writing in 1817, laments the robbing of stone from the causeway for use in the construction of a modern field boundary, writing: ...|$|E

500|$|The Copán {{buildings}} suffered {{significantly from}} {{forces of nature}} in the centuries between the site's abandonment and the rediscovery of the ruins. After the abandonment of the city the Copán River gradually changed course, with a meander destroying the eastern portion of the acropolis (revealing in the process its archaeological stratigraphy in a large vertical cut) and apparently washing away various subsidiary architectural groups, including at least one courtyard and 10 buildings from Group 10L2. The cut is an important archaeological feature at the site, with the <b>natural</b> <b>erosion</b> having created an enormous cross-section of the acropolis. This erosion cut away {{a large portion of}} the eastern part of the acropolis and revealed a vertical cross-section that measures [...] high at its tallest point and [...] long. Several buildings recorded in the 19thcentury were destroyed, plus an unknown amount of the acropolis that was eroded before it could be recorded. In order to avoid further destruction of the acropolis, the Carnegie Institution redirected the river to save the archaeological site, diverting it southwards in the 1930s; the dry former riverbed was finally filled in at the same time as consolidation of the cut in 1990s. Structures 10L19, 20, 20A and 21 were all destroyed by the Copán River as it eroded the site away, but had been recorded by investigators in the 19thcentury.|$|E
2500|$|Since the crater's formation, the rim {{is thought}} to have lost [...] of height at the rim crest due to <b>natural</b> <b>erosion.</b> Similarly, the basin of the crater {{is thought to}} have {{approximately}} [...] of additional post-impact sedimentation from lake sediments and of alluvium. These erosion processes are the reason that very few remaining craters are visible on Earth, since many have been erased by these geological processes. The relatively young age of Meteor Crater, paired with the Arizona climate, have allowed this crater to remain almost unchanged since its formation. The lack of erosion that preserved the crater's shape helped lead to this crater being the first crater recognized as an official impact crater from a natural celestial body.|$|E
2500|$|A narrow {{waterway}} {{known as}} the Split divides the island in two. Some people state that the Split was created by Hurricane Hattie in 1961 which devastated Belize City, however that is a myth. [...] Villagers who actually hand dredged it maintain that it is largely a man-made feature. [...] The Village Council Chairman at the time, Ramon Reyes, recounts that he and others dredged the waterway by hand after Hurricane Hattie opened a passage a few inches deep. This made a practical water way {{between the west and}} east sides of the island, intended at first for dugout canoes. The increased flow of tidal water has naturally dredged the opening to [...] deep until larger boats can now easily pass. The <b>natural</b> <b>erosion</b> continues to this day and threatens the soft sand banks of the waterway.|$|E
5000|$|Another early {{theory of}} {{geomorphology}} was devised by the polymath Chinese scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031-1095 AD). This {{was based on}} his observation of marine fossil shells in a geological stratum of a mountain {{hundreds of miles from}} the Pacific Ocean. Noticing bivalve shells running in a horizontal span along the cut section of a cliffside, he theorized that the cliff was once the pre-historic location of a seashore that had shifted hundreds of miles over the centuries. He inferred that the land was reshaped and formed by soil erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt, after observing strange <b>natural</b> <b>erosions</b> of the Taihang Mountains and the Yandang Mountain near Wenzhou. [...] Furthermore, he promoted the theory of gradual climate change over centuries of time once ancient petrified bamboos were found to be preserved underground in the dry, northern climate zone of Yanzhou, which is now modern day Yan'an, Shaanxi province.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} a {{methodology}} for modelling and retrieving satellite images basing on their spatial knowledge. The main idea of our approach is {{that the use of}} spatial knowledge, reasoning and inference technique, can contribute to deduce the susceptibility of the scene at <b>natural</b> risks (<b>erosion,</b> flooding, fires, etc.). Our methodology takes in input a set of multi-sensor images representing a scene. It contains four modules: (1) Modelling of the scene, (2) fusion of image annotations, (3) similar case retrieval, and (4) reasoning and interpretation. The first module generates annotations which represents the semantic content of the satellite scene. The second module allows merging image annotations to have faithful information to the reality. The third module attempts to find similar cases to those of the annotated query to take advantage of cases, situations and past problems. The fourth module allows deducting the susceptibility of the image in a given <b>natural</b> phenomenon (<b>Erosion,</b> flooding, fires), basing on inferences on knowledge of domain (Ontology, knowledge of expert, knowledge of natural phenomena, etc.) and the result of the previous phases...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} carry out the {{delimitation}} of APPs in the "Pariquera-Acu" Chart (IBGE, 1 : 50, 000), and to study the evolution of land use and <b>natural</b> susceptibility to <b>erosion</b> of these areas. It was performed photo interpretation of orthophotos for inclusion of features (wetlands, lakes, reservoirs). It has also been generated a hydrologically consistent digital elevation model and a slope matrix map for further delineation of the APPs of the study area. The images (Landsat TM) of different years (1986, 1997 and 2008) were classified by the method of Maximum Likelihood. A modeling of land changes was performed, to observe the losses and gains between the classes of land use in both periods. Using the Analytic Hierarchy Process and Multi-criteria Evaluation, it was also carried out an analysis of <b>natural</b> susceptibility to <b>erosion</b> according to <b>natural</b> factors: geology, soil conditions, rainfall and slope. The chart studied has 14, 000. 7 ha of APP, 19. 9 % of the total study area (70, 189. 1 ha). The Dense arboreal vegetation class was the most present in all the APPs of the study area, in 2008 this class already occupied 56. 8 % of total APPs. All categories of APPs had most of its areas with High <b>natural</b> susceptibility to <b>erosion</b> (68. 1 %). Both the <b>natural</b> susceptibility to <b>erosion</b> and the use and occupation of land, in different categories of APPs appear to be linked to the altitude and slope associated with the areas where they are located.
