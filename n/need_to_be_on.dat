25|$|Noll {{has become}} a popular {{internet}} meme, particularly in Australia. The popular phrase 'Shannon Noll was robbed of the 2003 Australian Idol title' gained popularity in 2015, with multiple Facebook pages appearing featuring the phrase. Noll acknowledged the internet fame, finding it 'very funny' and stating 'Some of the stuff they’ve done is bloody brilliant and very clever and very funny. I reckon half of the kids putting together these memes <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> my marketing team!' In January 2016 a Facebook page was created titled 'Get Shannon Noll to Groovin' the Moo 2016'. Despite the pages thousands of likes the organisers of Groovin' the Moo didn't {{reach out to the}} artist to perform. In June 2016, the 'GATchphrase' for the 2016 GAT (a theme chosen by the VCE students of Victoria to write into their papers to show group protest) was voted to be Shannon Noll was robbed of the 2003 Australia Idol title. An estimated 3,600 took part in this event. Noll is recognisable by his southern cross tattoo, an image of which was highly circulated in internet meme culture. This displays his patriotic pride and love for Australia.|$|E

At the month's start, he embarked on the North American leg of The Ecstatic Tour, performing through mid September with Jay Electronica as his opening act and co-headlining certain shows with Kweli and singer Erykah Badu. He toured into the following year, playing a series of concerts in Japan during late 2009, Australia in January 2010, and the United Kingdom in April.|$|E

In fact, it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!' This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be all right, because this World was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the watch out for.|$|E

2500|$|Augmenting the {{preliminary}} artillery bombardment, [...] and medium bombers of the Royal Air Force (RAF) and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) would attack in three waves, {{in the largest}} air raid launched in direct support of ground forces in the campaign so far. Speed was {{an essential part of}} the Goodwood plan and it was hoped that the aerial bombardment would pave the way for the 11th Armoured Division, rapidly to secure the Bourguébus Ridge. Dempsey believed that if the operation were to succeed, his tanks would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the ridge by the first afternoon and cancelled a second attack by heavy bombers scheduled for the first afternoon; although this was to be in direct support of the advance towards the ridge, he was concerned that the 11th Armoured Division should not be delayed waiting for the strike. Close air support for Goodwood would be provided by No. 83 Group RAF, to neutralise German positions on the flanks of VIII Corps, strong points such as the village of Cagny, attacking German gun and reserve positions and the interdiction of German troop movements. Each of the VIII Corps brigade headquarters, was allocated a Forward Air Control Post.|$|E
6000|$|The dame was in hot {{haste to}} get home. Rumours were rife as to Scottish invasions, and her tower {{was not too}} far south not to <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> its guard. Her plan was to pack Grisell on a small litter slung to a sumpter mule, and she snorted a kind of defiant {{contempt}} when the Countess, backed by the household barber-surgeon, declared the proceeding barbarous and impossible. Indeed she had probably forgotten that Grisell was far too tall to be made up into the bundle she intended; but she then declared that the wench might ride pillion behind old Diccon, {{and she would not}} be convinced till she was taken up to the sick chamber. There the first sound that greeted them was a choking agony of sobs and moans, while the tirewoman stood over the bed, exclaiming, [...] "Aye, no wonder; it serves thee right, thou evil wench, filching my Lady Countess's mirror from her very chamber, when it might have been broken for all thanks to thee. The Venice glass that the merchant gave her! Thou art not so fair a sight, I trow, as to be in haste to see thyself. At the bottom of all the scathe in the Castle! We shall be well rid of thee." ...|$|E
6000|$|My {{heart was}} touched by your regret that I hadn't given you [...] "a great deal of my news"--though my reason {{suggested}} that I could not have given you what there was not to give. [...] "La plus belle fille du monde ne peut donner que ce qu'elle a." [...] I turn out news in very small quantities--it is impossible to imagine an existence less pervaded with any sort of chiaroscuro. I am turning into an old, and very contented, Parisian: I feel as if I had struck roots into the Parisian soil, and were likely to let them grow tangled and tenacious there. It is a very comfortable and profitable place, on the whole--I mean, especially, on its general and cosmopolitan side. Of pure Parisianism I see absolutely nothing. The great merit of the place is that one can arrange one's life here exactly as one pleases--that there are facilities for every kind of habit and taste, and that everything is accepted and understood. Paris itself meanwhile {{is a sort of}} painted background which keeps shifting and changing, and which is always there, to be looked at when you please, and to be most easily and comfortably ignored when you don't. All this, if you were only here, you would feel much better than I can tell you--and you would write some happy piece of your prose about it which would make me feel it better, afresh. Ergo, come--when you can! I shall probably be here still. Of course every good thing is still better in spring, and in spite of much mean weather I have been liking Paris these last weeks more than ever. In fact I have accepted destiny here, under the vernal influence. If you sometimes read my poor letters in the Tribune, you get a notion of some of the things I see and do. I suppose also you get some gossip about me from Quincy St. Besides this there is not a great deal to tell. I have seen a certain number of people all winter who have helped to pass the time, but I have formed but one or two relations of permanent value, and which I desire to perpetuate. I have seen almost nothing of the literary fraternity, and there are fifty reasons why I should not become intimate with them. I don't like their wares, and they don't like any others; and besides, they are not accueillants. Turgenev is worth the whole heap of them, and yet he himself swallows them down in a manner that excites my extreme wonder. But he is the most loveable of men and takes all things easily. He is so pure and strong a genius that he doesn't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the defensive as regards his opinions and enjoyments. The mistakes he may make don't hurt him. His modesty and naïveté are simply infantine. I gave him some time since the message you sent him, and he bade me to thank you very kindly and to say that he had the most agreeable memory of your two books. He has just gone to Russia to bury himself for two or three months on his estate, and try and finish a long novel he has for three or four years been working upon. I hope to heaven he may. I suspect he works little here.|$|E
