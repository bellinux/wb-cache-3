5|$|It {{was first}} {{revealed}} that Bieber and Flatts would be shooting a video for the remix {{version of the}} song when TMZ revealed photos on Bieber on set of the video shoot. The photos pictured Bieber after a dramatic haircut, changing his trademark style over the previous two years. The video premiered during the ABC special, Rascal Flatts: <b>Nothing</b> <b>Like</b> <b>This</b> Presented by JC Penney, which aired March 12, 2011. The video begins with Rascal Flatts arriving in a Cadillac Escalade to a studio. Inside, they are directed to Bieber, who is playing the keyboard. Bieber then sings his lines, playing guitar, and is joined by Joe Don Rooney also on guitar, and Jay DeMarcus now on keyboard. The woman who directed the band into the studio now directs them and Bieber into another room with lights, to film the video. Gary LeVox then sings his lines, joined by Bieber for the chorus while Rooney is on guitar and DeMarcus playing a grand piano. All are wearing black, with Bieber in particular wearing a leather jacket, his signature dog tag, and grey Supras sneakers. During the sequence of the video, more behind-the-scenes action is shown, before it ends with only Bieber's silhouette shown, as his jacket is on the ground.|$|E

Judge further explained her position saying, [...] "Let's be clear– live means live. If you are spending up to $200 I think you deserve better than a film clip". Tour director Steve Dixon defended Spears, claiming, [...] "This is a pop spectacular, this is a showband show. You come for the experience.

2500|$|The {{popularity}} of baseball in Canada during Walker's youth was minuscule {{in contrast to}} the following he would help spawn related to his later success with the Montreal Expos. [...] Previously, Canadian baseball luminaries included Tip O'Neill, the first Canadian to win a Triple Crown back in 1887, and Ferguson Jenkins, Canada's first selectee to the American Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991. [...] It was Walker who would help dramatically increase the profile of the sport in a hockey-mad nation. [...] Part of the factor was Canada's short summers, so it is more challenging to play outdoors than in the United States. [...] Recalled Walker later in his major league career, “I’d never seen a forkball, never seen a slider. [...] I didn’t know they existed. [...] I had never really seen a good curveball. [...] In Canada, as a kid, we’d play 10 baseball games a year. [...] Fifteen, tops. [...] Some pitchers had a thing they’d call a spinner, but <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> [...] Baseball just wasn’t big. [...] The weather was against it. [...] Nobody ever played baseball thinking about making the major leagues." [...] He was also unaware of many of the rules, attesting to his lack of experience playing when he turned a professional.|$|E

Both productions travelled to the Hong Kong Arts Festival in 1987. Of the role he originated in The Coffin is Too Big for the Hole, Lim remembers: [...] "For me, [...] was panic stations. I had never done a long monologue. In drama school, we had to prepare monologues based on a Shakespearean character. <b>Nothing</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> which was 30 to 35 minutes long.

2500|$|... "This sonnet {{plays with}} poetic {{conventions}} in which, for example, the mistress's eyes are {{compared with the}} sun, her lips with coral, and her cheeks with roses. His mistress, says the poet, is <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> conventional image, but is as lovely as any woman". Here, Barbara Mowat offers her opinion of the meaning behind Sonnet 130; this work breaks the mold to which Sonnets had come to conform. Shakespeare composed a sonnet which seems to parody a great many sonnets of the time. Poets like Thomas Watson, Michael Drayton, and Barnabe Barnes were all part of this sonnet craze and each wrote sonnets proclaiming love for an almost unimaginable figure; Patrick Crutwell posits that Sonnet 130 could actually be a satire of the Thomas Watson poem [...] "Passionate Century of Love", {{pointing out that the}} Watson poem contains {{all but one of the}} platitudes that Shakespeare is making fun of in Sonnet 130. However, E.G. Rogers points out the similarities between Watson's [...] "Passionate Century of Love," [...] Sonnet 130, and Richard Linche's Poem collection entitled [...] "Diella." [...] There is a great deal of similarity between sections of the Diella poem collection and Shakespeare's [...] "Sonnet 130", for example in [...] "130" [...] we see, [...] "If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head," [...] where in [...] "Diella" [...] we see [...] "Her hayre exceeds fold forced in the smallest wire." [...] Each work uses a comparison of hairs to wires; while in modern sense this may seem unflattering, one could argue that Linche's work draws upon the beauty of weaving gold and that Shakespeare mocks this with harsh comparison. This, along with other similarities in textual content, lead, as E.G. Rogers points out, the critic to believe that Diella may have been the source of inspiration for both homage, by Watson's [...] "Passionate Century of Love," [...] and satire by Shakespeare's [...] "Sonnet 130." [...] The idea of Satire is further enforced by final couplet of [...] "130" [...] in which the speaker delivers his most expositional line: [...] "And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare, as any she belied with false compare." [...] This line projects the message behind this work, demeaning the false comparisons made by many poets of the time.|$|E
