50|$|There {{are three}} types of IAPs: {{precision}} approach (PA), approach with vertical guidance (APV), and <b>nonprecision</b> <b>approach</b> (NPA). A PA uses a navigation system that provides course and glidepath deviation. Examples include precision approach radar (PAR), instrument landing system (ILS), and GBAS landing system (GLS). An APV also uses a navigation system for course and glidepath deviation, just not to the same standards as a PA. Examples include baro-VNAV, localizer type directional aid (LDA) with glidepath, LNAV/VNAV and LPV. An NPA uses a navigation system for course deviation but does not provide glidepath information. These approaches include VOR, NDB and LNAV. NPAs are flown to a minimum descent altitude (MDA).|$|R

They further stated, [...] "The Board has not been able to determine the reason for the (greater) descent, although the two most likely explanations are an improper use of cockpit instrumentation data, or (b) an altimetry system error."

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the future {{utilization}} of the Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) by civil helicopters will provide an enhanced performance not obtainable with current navigations systems. GPS will supply properly equipped users with extremely accurate three-dimensional position and velocity information anywhere in the world. Preliminary studies have been conducted to investigate differential GPS concept mechanizations and cost, and to theoretically predict navigation performance and the impact of degradation of the GPS C/A code for national security considerations. The obtained results are encouraging, but certain improvements are needed. As a second step in the program, a single-channel sequential GPS navigator was installed and operated in the NASA SH- 3 G helicopter. A series of flight tests were conducted. It is found that performance of the Navstar GPS Z-set is quite acceptable to support area navigation and <b>nonprecision</b> <b>approach</b> operations...|$|R
40|$|Use of a {{microprocessor}} for providing navigation {{information from the}} inherent hyperbolic geometries of Loran-C was discussed. The advantages Loran-C offers over VOR/DME as a primary navigation aid are identified. These advantages include long range coverage by several stations, coverage at low altitudes, and the capability to have <b>nonprecision</b> <b>approaches</b> at airports not already served by landing aids. Modern digital electronic technology is used to produce a device to convert Loran-C data to useful pilot information using simple software algorithms and low cost microprocessor devices. The cost and lack of availability of suitable processors to execute these algorithms have prevented a Loran-C navigator from being developed. Results indicate that the microprocessor based Loran-C navigator has an accuracy of 1. 0 nm or less over an area typically covered by a triad of Loran-C stations and can execute a position update in less than 0. 2 seconds...|$|R
40|$|Enhancing aircrew {{situational}} awareness has become {{recognized as a}} critical element in reduction of overall aircraft accident rates. Improved display concepts have been investigated for several decades {{as a means of}} enhancing awareness of position, flight path, and terrain in three dimensions. One of the most promising is the “Tunnel-in-the-Sky ” primary flight display, which presents a three-dimensional depiction of the world with the desired flight path shown as a tunnel or series of hoops. A prototype system was developed to explore the real-world implications of the Tunnel-in-the-Sky display concept. This paper documents flight testing on a Beechcraft Queen Air to investigate real-world operations within the current Air Traffic Control system. A series of tunnel “overlay approaches ” was designed on top of existing, published instrument procedures to demonstrate advantages for <b>nonprecision</b> <b>approaches,</b> closely spaced parallel approaches, and noise abatement.

As a result GPS only system is allowed to be used only as a supplemental means of navigation for aircraft in the less critical situations such as en-route, terminal and <b>nonprecision</b> <b>approach</b> stages of flight. All that is about to change with the advent of SBAS and GBAS. Space Based Augmentation System (SBAS) provides the much needed reliability assurances to the solution from the GPS, in addition to the improvement of accuracy and availability of the solution.
