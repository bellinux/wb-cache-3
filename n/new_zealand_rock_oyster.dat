50|$|The Sydney rock oyster, <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>rock</b> <b>oyster,</b> or Auckland oyster (Saccostrea glomerata), is {{an oyster}} species endemic to Australia and New Zealand. In Australia {{it is found}} in bays, inlets and {{sheltered}} estuaries from Wingan Inlet in eastern Victoria, along {{the east coast of}} New South Wales and up to Hervey Bay, Queensland, around northern Australia and down the west coast to Shark Bay in Western Australia. There is also a small introduced population on Flinders Island, in Bass Strait, Tasmania and in Albany on the south west coast of Western Australia, where they are farmed. In New Zealand, where the species is not farmed, it is known as the <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>rock</b> <b>oyster</b> or Auckland oyster. The Sydney rock oyster is closely related to Saccostrea cucullata, or hooded oyster, which is common on Indo-Pacific rocky shores.|$|E
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of virus by the <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>rock</b> <b>oyster</b> Crassostrea glomerata {{has been studied}} in a static seawater system using radioactively labeled reovirus type III and Semliki Forest virus. The uptake of virus {{was found to be}} less rapid than for the bacterium Escherichia coli and to be unaffected by the presence of the marine alga Dunaliella primolecta in the seawater. Accumulation was dependent on virus concentration, with saturation achieved at 4 X 10 (10) reovirus particles per oyster, implying that an oyster possesses a large but finite number of sites for virus adsorption. When the rates of uptake of two viruses of similar size but differing surface properties were compared, the rate of {{accumulation of}} the lipoprotein-enveloped Semliki Forest virus was found to be less than that for the protein-enclosed reovirus. This observation, together with the finding that the oyster shell has a strong affinity for virus, suggests that surface properties, rather than size, are the principal factors governing the accumulation of viruses by filter-feeding marine bivalves...|$|E
