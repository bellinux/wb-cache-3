The reactor synthesis is followed by a complex process of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but at much smaller amounts, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Owing to the small amounts of produced einsteinium and the short half-life of its most easily produced isotope, there are currently almost no practical applications for it outside basic scientific research.

Molecular gas {{has been}} searched for and found in {{unexpectedly}} large quantities in some collisional debris of interacting galaxies: HI-rich tidal tails, bridges and collisional rings. It {{was so far}} observed through millimeter observations of the CO line and detected towards or near regions of starformation associated to dense condensations of the atomic hydrogen. The discovery of cool H 2 at distances greater than 50 kpc from the parent (colliding) galaxies, whereas the external disk of spirals is {{generally considered to be}} CO–poor, raised question on its origin and favored the hypothesis of a local production out of collapsed HI clouds. However recent observations of a diffuse CO <b>component</b> along tidal <b>debris</b> have challenged this idea. Another recent puzzle is the measurement in the collisional debris of two interacting systems and four recycled objects of a missing mass, whereas no dark matter is expected there.

The decay of our aging universe is reviewed first. The accelerated expansion takes the decay debris into the inter-universal medium (IUM) of the multiverse for conservation. A prominent <b>component</b> <b>of</b> the <b>debris</b> and of the IUM is the enormous number of old cold photons from decaying universes. When a small central volume (apparently 6. 4 {{percent of the total}} mass) of our proto-universe reached proton density, the old photons and protons became fully re-energized.

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of successful endodontic treatment is the hermetic obturation of the root canal system. To achieve this, the root canal filling must seal the canal space both apically and coronally to prevent the ingress of microorganisms or tissue fluids into the canal space. Apical leakage is reported a common reason for the clinical failure of endodontic therapy. Leakage through an obturated root canal {{is expected to take}} place at interfaces between sealer and dentin or sealer and gutta-percha, or through voids within the sealer. Hence, the sealing quality of root canal filling depends much on the sealing ability of the sealer. Therefore, anything that may influence the adaptation of the root filling to the canal wall is can determine the degree and the extent of leakage, and ultimately the prognosis of the endodontic therapy. In endodontic therapy, the smear layer formation results from root canal preparation and may influence the effective seal of the root canal system.

40|$|Although the {{processes}} by which glacial debris mantles alter the melting of glacier ice have been well studied, the mass balance and runoff patterns of Himalayan debris-covered glaciers and the response of these factors to climate change are not well understood. Many previous studies have addressed mechanisms of ice melt under debris mantles by applying multiplicative parameters derived from field experiments, and other studies have calculated the details of heat conduction through the debris layer. However, those approaches cannot be applied at catchment scale because distributions of thickness and thermal property of debris are heterogeneous and difficult to measure. Here, we established a runoff model for a Himalayan debris-covered glacier in which the spatial distribution of the thermal properties of the debris mantle is estimated from remotely sensed multi-temporal data. We applied the model to the Tsho Rolpa Glacial Lake–Trambau Glacier basin in the Nepal Himalaya, using hydro-meteorological observations obtained for a 3. 5 -year period (1993 – 1996). We calculated long-term averages <b>of</b> runoff <b>components</b> for the period 1980 – 2007 using gridded reanalysis datasets. Our calculations suggest that excess meltwater, which implies the additional water runoff compared with the ice-free terrain, from the debris-covered area contributes significantly to the total runoff, mainly because of its location at a lower elevation. Uncertainties in runoff simulation due to estimations of the thermal properties and albedo of the debris-covered surface were assessed to be approximately 8 % of the runoff from the debris-covered area. We evaluated the sensitivities <b>of</b> runoff <b>components</b> to changes in air temperature and precipitation. As expected, warmer air temperatures increase the total runoff by increasing the melting rate; however, increased precipitation slightly reduces the total runoff, as ice melting is suppressed by the increased snow cover and associated high albedo. The response of total runoff to changing precipitation is complex because of the different responses <b>of</b> individual <b>components</b> (glacier, <b>debris,</b> and ice-free terrain) to precipitation...|$|R

Combined with the returned lunar sample {{studies and analyses}} of lunar photography, we have {{learned a great deal}} about the nature and origin of these explosive volcanic materials. Lunar pyroclastic deposits are more numerous, extensive, and widely distributed than previously thought. Two generic classes of lunar pyroclastics have been identified, regional and localized. From the former, two separate spectral compositional groups have been identified; one is dominated by Fe(2 +) -bearing glasses, the other is composed of ilmenite-rich black spheres. Comparatively, three separate spectral groups have been identified among the localized deposits: highlands-rich, olivine-rich, and mare-rich. Returned sample studies and the recently collected Galileo and Clementine data also corroborate these findings. Albedo data and multispectral imagery suggest that the thicker core deposits of the regional dark mantle deposits (RDMD) are surrounded by pyroclastic debris and subjacent highlands material. The presence <b>of</b> a major <b>component</b> <b>of</b> pyroclastic <b>debris</b> in the regolith surrounding the core regional deposits has important implications for the resource potential of these materials.

Some of them are the mixture of metal and oxide, or mixtures after melting. Sulfurization method is one of the promising techniques for the separation and recovery of rare metals. Especially, the dry process has an advantage for the reduction of radioactive waste in nuclear engineering field.

Situations in which apoptosis is increased, such as Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, could conceivably accelerate the generation of autoantibodies and increase the levels of autoantigens present, precipitating a flare-up of the disease (Santana et al. 2005). It has been suggested that the trigger may be an autoimmune response to an epithelial antigen, such as those seen in cutaneous SLE reactions (Gordon et al. 2009). Electron microscopy has shown that the histiocytes, activated lymphocytes and endothelial cells in the affected lymph nodes of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease contain tubuloreticular structures similar to those seen in endothelial cells and lymphocytes of patients with SLE (Imamura et al. 1982). The significance of this observation is uncertain, although it hints at a common pathogenesis. Some authors consider it to be supporting evidence for a hyperimmune response of viral aetiology (Gionanlis et al. 2009). It has been suggested that Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease lies on the same disease spectrum as SLE, representing a milder form of the disease (Gionanlis et al. 2009). There is one report of two twin sisters who were human-leucocyte antigen-identical, each of whom developed Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease 10  years apart. This observation hints at the possibility of a genetic predisposition. However, neither of the sisters developed SLE or any other autoimmune sequelae (Amir et al. 2002).|$|R
40|$|Marine debris {{is defined}} as {{material}} that is solid, persistent, manufactured or processed, and deliberately or not-deliberately left in the marine environment. Marine debris comes in many shapes and forms, {{ranging in size from}} microscopic microplastics to large vessels. Marine debris is a big and growing global problem, pose threats to marine life sustainability. Plastic is a major <b>component</b> <b>of</b> marine <b>debris,</b> and single use packaging accounts for an increasing part of the global marine debris load. Research on marine debris were conducted on coastal areas and Small Island of South Sulawesi destined for local tourism, i. e. Karama beach, Bodia beach and Mandi beach (Galesong, Takalar District), Tanjung Bayang beach, Akkarena beach and Lae-lae island/also known as Bob beach (Makassar City). This research was aimed at identifying marine debris according to its types, size and mass. Debris were collected in a 25 x 60 m transect with 30 m towards land and waters, respectively, with 3 replication transects at every location, whilst collections of debris were conducted during low and high tides. Current (direction and speed) and waves (incoming direction and height) were also measured as supporting parameters. Surrounding sampling location characteristics were also recorded. Result showed that Karama beach is found with highest total marine debris mass in Takalar (36. 44 kg), whilst in Makassar the Lae-lae island was found to be the highest with debris mass (43. 22 kg). Plastic were predominant debris at all sampling locations with percentages of 62. 7 ??? 86. 6 %. Lastly, the predominant size was macro-debris (25 - 100 cm) ...|$|R
40|$|Borneo, {{located in}} {{equatorial}} SE Asia, {{is the third}} largest island in the world, although it is topographically low. One of the unusual features of Borneo is {{the large amount of}} Cenozoic clastic sediments that have accumulated in several basins on and around the island. The ultimate source areas of the Cenozoic sequences have been suggested to be either mainland SE Asia/Indochina or Borneo itself. During the Paleogene until the earliest Miocene, deep marine turbidites were deposited in an accretionary wedge setting. Provenance studies on these Paleogene sediments based on detrital modes of sandstones and heavy mineral studies show that they have all been derived from a recycled orogenic source. Upper Cretaceous to Eocene sediments, the Sapulut and Trusmadi Formations, are compositionally mature (quartzose recycled), and may have been derived from mainland SE Asia/Indochina. During the Eocene there was an important change in sediment maturity and a provenance shift from quartzose to intermediate recycled sandstones. Heavy mineral studies show that the Eocene-Oligocene sediments of the Crocker Formation are mainly derived from granite, and that granite debris has been derived directly from its source or has been only slightly recycled/transported. The ultimate source area for these sediments was probably the Schwaner Mountains of southern Borneo, although a minor <b>component</b> <b>of</b> ophiolite <b>debris</b> suggests derivation from nearby basement of northern Borneo. The relative immaturity and heavy mineral suites of the Crocker Formation indicate it was derived from Borneo itself rather than SE Asia/Indochina, but primarily from basement sources rather than by recycling of older sediments...|$|R
