40|$|Microvalves {{containing}} silicone-rubber seals actuated by {{heating and}} cooling of paraffin have been proposed for development as integral components of microfluidic systems. In comparison with other microvalves actuated by various means (electrostatic, electromagnetic, piezoelectric, pneumatic, and others), the proposed valves (1) would contain simpler structures that could be fabricated at lower cost and (2) could be actuated by simpler (and thus less expensive) control systems. Each valve according to the proposal would include a flow channel bounded on one side by a flat surface {{and on the other}} side by a curved surface defined by an arched-cross-section, elastic seal made of silicone rubber [polydimethylsilane (PDMS) ]. The seal would be sized and shaped so that the elasticity of the PDMS would hold the channel open except when the seal was pressed down onto the flat surface to close the channel. The principle of actuation would exploit the fact that upon melting or freezing, the volume of a typical paraffin increases or decreases, respectively, by about 15 percent. In a valve according to the proposal, the seal face opposite that of the channel would be in contact with a piston-like plug of paraffin. In the case of a valve designed to be <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> at ambient temperature, one would use a paraffin having a melting temperature above ambient. The seal would be pushed against the flat surface to close the channel by heating the paraffin above its melting temperature. In the case of a valve designed to be normally closed at ambient temperature, one would use a paraffin having a melting temperature below ambient. The seal would be allowed to spring away from the flat surface to open the channel by cooling the paraffin below its melting temperature. The availability of paraffins that have melting temperatures from 70 to + 80 C should make it possible to develop a variety of normally closed and <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> <b>valves.</b> The figure depicts examples of prototype <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> and <b>normally</b> closed <b>valves</b> according to the proposal. In each valve, an arch cross section defining a channel having dimensions of the order of tens of micrometers would be formed in a silicone-rubber sheet about 40 m thick. The silicone rubber sheet would be hermetically sealed to a lower glass plate that would define the sealing surface and to an upper glass plate containing a well. The well would be filled with paraffin and capped with a rigid restraining layer of epoxy. In the <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> <b>valve,</b> the paraffin would have a melting temperature above ambient (e. g., 40 C) and the wall of the well would be coated with a layer of titanium that would serve as an electric heater. In the normally closed valve, the paraffin would have a melting temperature below ambient (e. g. - 5 C). Instead of a heater in the well, the normally closed valve would include a thermoelectric cooler on top of the epoxy cap...|$|R

40|$|The ease of {{fabrication}} {{and integration}} of pneumatic microvalves has enabled extensive miniaturization of microfluidic devices {{that are capable of}} performing massively parallel operations. These valves in their typical open configuration, also known as <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> (NO) <b>valves,</b> require to be actuated to remain closed. As a result, devices employing these valves have limited portability in applications that require valves to be closed continuously. Normally closed (NC) valves based on pneumatic actuation not only address the above issue of portability, but also retain the ease of integrating massively parallel networks of microfluidic elements. In this thesis, I report the design, fabrication, and application of elastomeric NC microvalves, along with systematic experimental characterization of NC valve operation. Geometrical parameters of the valve, including shape, fluid channel width, membrane thickness, and valve asymmetry were examined with the objective of minimizing actuation pressures and ensuring reliable operation. I observed that introduction of asymmetry in the valve geometry created points of weak adhesion between the valve and the substrate, which facilitated opening of the valve at lower actuation pressures. Specifically, valves with a sharp corner feature (v-shaped) actuated at lower pressures (1. 5 psi) compared to straight-shaped valves (3 psi). I also observed that membrane thickness does not significantly influence the actuation pressures. An important requirement for microfluidic devices using NC valves is selective irreversible bonding of the fluid layer to the substrate, which I achieved by plasma sealing of the fluid layer to the substrate while simultaneously actuating the valves. Based on our experimental observations, I formulated a set of design considerations with the objective of minimizing actuation pressures, ensuring reliable operation, and facilitating convenient integration into complex microfluidic devices. These NC valves have significant potential in applications where portability is highly desired, such as in on-chip analysis, crystallization screening, and in the study of chemical or biological processes over long durations of time. I utilized these optimized design considerations to fabricate a 4 x 6 multiplexed microfluidic platform capable of combinatorial exposure of bacterial cells (E. coli) to diverse metabolites such as toxins, hormones, and antibiotics. I validated these chips for biological applications first by studying cell growth, and then demonstrated the multiplexing capabilities with inducible expression of the Green Florescent Protein (GFP) gene in E. coli cells on-chip using different concentrations of isopropyl β-D- 1 -thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The key application of the platform is its utilization in antibiotic susceptibility screening...|$|R
