5|$|Normally brain {{electrical}} activity is non-synchronous. Its activity is regulated by various factors {{both within the}} <b>neuron</b> and the cellular environment. Factors within the <b>neuron</b> include the type, number and distribution of ion channels, changes to receptors and changes of gene expression. Factors around the <b>neuron</b> include ion concentrations, synaptic plasticity and regulation of transmitter breakdown by glial cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain is}} {{composed}} {{of a network of}} neurons that transmit signals by propagating nerve impulses. The propagation of this impulse from one <b>neuron</b> to another is typically controlled by neurotransmitters, though there are also electrical pathways between some neurons. Neurotransmitters can inhibit impulse firing (primarily done by Î³-aminobutyric acid, or GABA) or they can excite the <b>neuron</b> into firing (primarily done by glutamate). A <b>neuron</b> that releases inhibitory neurotransmitters from its terminals is called an inhibitory <b>neuron,</b> while one that releases excitatory neurotransmitters is an excitatory <b>neuron.</b> When the normal balance between inhibition and excitation is significantly disrupted in {{all or part of the}} brain, a seizure can occur. The GABA system is an important target for anticonvulsant drugs, since seizures may be discouraged by increasing GABA synthesis, decreasing its breakdown, or enhancing its effect on neurons.|$|E
5|$|Autism is a {{disorder}} that {{is associated with}} social and communicative deficits. A single cause of autism has yet to be identified, but the mu wave and mirror <b>neuron</b> system have been studied specifically for their role in the disorder. In a typically developing individual, the mirror <b>neuron</b> system responds when he or she either watches someone perform a task or performs the task him- or herself. In individuals with autism, mirror neurons become active (and consequently mu waves are suppressed) only when the individual performs the task him- or herself. This finding has led some scientists, notably V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues, to view autism as disordered understanding of other individuals' intentions and goals due to problems with the mirror <b>neuron</b> system. This deficiency would explain the difficulty people with autism have in communicating with and understanding others. While most studies of the mirror <b>neuron</b> system and mu waves in people with autism have focused on simple motor tasks, some scientists speculate that these tests can be expanded to show that problems with the mirror <b>neuron</b> system underlie overarching cognitive and social deficits.|$|E
50|$|Muscle {{spindles}} {{consist of}} both sensory <b>neurons</b> and motor <b>neurons</b> {{in order to}} provide proprioception and make the appropriate movements via firing of motor <b>neurons.</b> There are three types of lower motor <b>neurons</b> involved in muscle contraction: alpha motor <b>neurons,</b> gamma motor <b>neurons,</b> and beta motor <b>neurons.</b> Alpha motor <b>neurons,</b> the most abundant type, are used in the actual force for muscle contraction and therefore innervate extrafusal muscle fibers (muscle fibers outside of the muscle spindle). Gamma motor <b>neurons,</b> on the other hand, innervate only intrafusal muscle fibers (within the muscle spindle), whereas beta motor <b>neurons,</b> which are present in very low amounts, innervate both intrafusal and extrafusal muscle cells. Beta motor <b>neurons</b> have a conduction velocity greater than that of both other types of lower motor <b>neurons,</b> but there is little currently known about beta motor <b>neurons.</b> Alpha motor <b>neurons</b> are highly abundant and larger in size than gamma motor <b>neurons.</b>|$|R

5|$|Based on {{findings}} correlating mirror <b>neuron</b> {{activity and}} mu wave suppression in individuals with autism as in typically developing individuals, {{studies have examined}} both the development of mirror neurons and therapeutic means for stimulating the system. A recent study has found that fMRI activation magnitudes in the inferior frontal gyrus increase with age in people with autism. This finding was not apparent in typically developing individuals. Furthermore, greater activation was associated with greater amounts of eye contact and better social functioning. Scientists believe the inferior frontal gyrus {{is one of the}} main neural correlates with the mirror <b>neuron</b> system in humans and is often related to deficits associated with autism. These findings suggest that the mirror <b>neuron</b> system may not be non-functional in individuals with autism, but simply abnormal in its development. This information is significant to the present discussion because mu waves may be integrating different areas of mirror <b>neuron</b> activity in the brain. Other studies have assessed attempts to consciously stimulate the mirror <b>neuron</b> system and suppress mu waves using neurofeedback (a type of biofeedback given through computers that analyze real time recordings of brain activity, in this case EEGs of mu waves). This type of therapy is still in its early phases of implementation for individuals with autism, and has conflicting forecasts for success.|$|E
5|$|In epileptic {{seizures}} a {{group of}} neurons begin firing in an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized manner. This results {{in a wave of}} depolarization known as a paroxysmal depolarizing shift. Normally, after an excitatory <b>neuron</b> fires it becomes more resistant to firing for a period of time. This {{is due in part to}} the effect of inhibitory neurons, electrical changes within the excitatory <b>neuron,</b> and the negative effects of adenosine.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{familiar}} form of cellular signaling is synaptic transmission, whereby a nerve impulse that has {{reached the end of}} one <b>neuron</b> is conveyed to an adjacent <b>neuron</b> via the release of neurotransmitters. This transmission is made possible by the action of synaptic vesicles loaded with the neurotransmitters to be released. These vesicles fuse with the cell membrane at the pre-synaptic terminal and release its contents to the exterior of the cell. The contents then diffuse across the synapse to the post-synaptic terminal.|$|E

The {{work in this}} {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} identifying corticothalamic <b>neurons</b> and characterizing the signals carried along this pathway in the primate motor system. All experiments were carried out in awake primates performing a visually-guided center-out reaching task. We used stimulation in the motor thalamus (VPLo) to antidromically and orthodromically activate <b>neurons</b> in the primary motor cortex. Cortical <b>neurons</b> that showed antidromic responses to thalamic stimulation were classified as corticothalamic <b>neurons</b> (CT), while those that showed orthodromic responses {{were considered to be}} recipients of information from the stimulated area of thalamus. We also recorded the neural activity of thalamic <b>neurons</b> near the stimulation sites. We identified two distinct populations of CT <b>neurons.</b> The "inactive" population had virtually no spontaneous or task-related neural activity, while the "active" population showed task related activity typical of M 1 pyramidal <b>neurons.</b> "Inactive" <b>neurons</b> typically exhibited long latencies and high thresholds to stimulation and were found deep within recording tracks, while "active" <b>neurons</b> had shorter latencies and lower thresholds to stimulation and were located more superficially in a recording track. We presumed that the "active" <b>neurons</b> are CT <b>neurons</b> that originate in cortical layer V and that the "inactive" <b>neurons</b> are layer VI CT <b>neurons.</b> We compared the neural activity of potentially connected groups of cortical and thalamic <b>neurons.</b> Corticothalamic <b>neurons</b> and the thalamic <b>neurons</b> located near the stimulation site from which those CT <b>neurons</b> were antidromically activated were grouped into CT sets and cortical <b>neurons</b> that showed orthodromic activation were grouped with thalamic <b>neurons</b> as part of TC sets. Based on the stimulation responses and narrow dispersion of preferred directions we proposed that these sets of <b>neurons</b> are potentially connected. Cortical <b>neurons</b> in both types of sets showed more sharply tuned directional responses than thalamic <b>neurons</b> in the same sets. Cortical <b>neurons</b> in CT sets modulated their activity earlier in relation to the onset of movement when compared with the thalamic <b>neurons</b> in the same sets and the cortical <b>neurons</b> in the TC sets...|$|R

5|$|With few exceptions, each <b>neuron</b> in {{the brain}} {{releases}} the same chemical neurotransmitter, or combination of neurotransmitters, at all the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons; this rule is known as Dale's principle. Thus, a <b>neuron</b> can be characterized by the neurotransmitters that it releases. The great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems. This applies to drugs such as cannabinoids, nicotine, heroin, cocaine, alcohol, fluoxetine, chlorpromazine, and many others.|$|E
5|$|Brain {{activity}} {{is made possible}} by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets. A <b>neuron</b> consists of a cell body, axon, and dendrites. Dendrites are often extensive branches that receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons. The signals received may cause the <b>neuron</b> to initiate an action potential (an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse) which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal, to connect with the dendrites or with the cell body of another <b>neuron.</b> An action potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon, which contains a complex of proteins. When an action potential, reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on the target cell. These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. Neurons link at synapses to form pathways and elaborate neural networks, and the activity between them is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E

Much of Fischbachâs research concentrated on the mechanisms controlling action potentials and synapses, from which he pioneered the use of <b>neuron</b> and muscle cell culture to study neuromuscular junctions. Fischbach used this technique to reconstruct neuromuscular junctions from dissociated spinal cord and muscle cells from chick embryos to show that functional synaptic connections reformed and were capable of sending spontaneous or induced action potentials. However, cultures containing isolated spinal cord cells were unable to send similar action potentials. This technique proved to be an important model for further studies to determine the essential mechanisms controlling neuromuscular junction development and maintenance. Towards the end of his tenure at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach began to search for motor <b>neuron</b> molecules responsible for regulating the number of acetylcholine receptors on postsynaptic cells.

ResultsChannelrhodopsin- 2 (ChR 2) stimulation of excitatory layer 2 / 3 barrel cortex <b>neurons</b> evoked larger and faster depolarizing postsynaptic potentials and more synaptically driven action potentials in fast-spiking (FS) GABAergic <b>neurons</b> compared to both non-fast-spiking (NFS) GABAergic <b>neurons</b> and postsynaptic excitatory pyramidal <b>neurons</b> located within the same neocortical microcircuit. The number of action potentials evoked in ChR 2 -expressing <b>neurons</b> showed low trial-to-trial variability, but postsynaptic responses varied strongly with near-linear dependence upon spontaneously driven changes in prestimulus membrane potential. Postsynaptic responses in excitatory <b>neurons</b> had reversal potentials, which were hyperpolarized relative to action potential threshold and were therefore inhibitory. Reversal potentials measured in postsynaptic GABAergic <b>neurons</b> were close to action potential threshold. Postsynaptic inhibitory <b>neurons</b> preferentially fired synaptically driven action potentials from spontaneously depolarized network states, with stronger state-dependent modulation in NFS GABAergic <b>neurons</b> compared to FS GABAergic <b>neurons.</b> ConclusionsInhibitory <b>neurons</b> appear to dominate neocortical microcircuit function, receiving stronger local excitatory synaptic input and firing more action potentials compared to excitatory <b>neurons.</b> In mouse layer 2 / 3 barrel cortex, we propose that strong state-dependent recruitment of inhibitory <b>neurons</b> drives competition among excitatory <b>neurons</b> enforcing sparse coding...|$|R
