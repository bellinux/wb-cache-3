25|$|Some {{members of}} the French parliament, {{as well as other}} observers, {{publicly}} decried the intense lobbying by various groups and industries. Bernard Carayon, UMP deputy for the Tarn département, denounced lobbying, pressures and even blackmail on the part of certain groups on national TV. A number of parliamentarians said they had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> intense lobbying from all sides, including a grassroot effort from Internet users and free software advocates which inundated them with letters and emails. At one point, Senator Michel Charasse demanded that parliamentary staff clean out corridors of loitering lobbyists.|$|E

According to Clarkson, the cameramen said they had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> {{consistency}} in the practice laps. However, Cowell was knocked off the top spot in Series 11 by Jay Kay, who now holds the fastest time in the Lacetti, although Clarkson selected the fastest of Jay Kay's times rather than the last run, which was slower than Cowell's time, seemingly due to a dislike of Cowell (he claimed earlier in the episode that Cowell had been {{at the top of the}} leaderboard for too long). Had this not happened, Cowell would have been knocked off the top by Grand Designs host Kevin McCloud.|$|E

500|$|Lewis became {{interested}} in making a film about hustlers because (despite there being films about hustlers dating back more than three decades) he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> a film. In Lewis's own words, [...] "When I started, there were no hustler movies and now there's a whole genre." [...] His original concept for Skin & Bone {{was that it would}} be a series of 70 one-minute shots. Lewis changed his mind about the concept following some improvisation with actor B. Wyatt in creating the Harry character. Much of the film was improvised. After a year of filming improvisation sessions, Lewis wrote some scripted material to provide some story structure. Shooting took several years to complete because the film was almost entirely self-financed.|$|E
500|$|The {{new version}} of the song was {{recorded}} on February 1, 2010, in a session lasting 14 hours. Eighty-five musicians were reportedly involved in the song's recording, which was held in the same place as the original, at Henson Recording Studio on La Brea Avenue in Los Angeles, California. Also similar to the 1985 process, some of the participating musicians were already in Los Angeles to attend an awards ceremony: the 52nd Grammy Awards. Jones said of the recording session, [...] "It was a big challenge. It takes a serious army and serious emotional architecture. I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> a diverse group of people, and they came for the right reasons." [...] The recording process brought together diverse artists, with the oldest being 83-year-old Tony Bennett and the youngest being 9-year-old Ethan Bortnick.|$|E
500|$|Sparks {{produced}} the album, their first in this genre, {{after it was}} commissioned as a radio musical by Sweden's national broadcasting service, Sveriges Radio. The project was proposed to Sparks by Marie Wennersten of SR Radioteatern, the station's radio drama department. Wennersten had become a Sparks fan after watching the duo perform in Sweden in 2004: [...] "I had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> energy and love from the audience. I thought the Södra Theatre {{was going to take}} off and fly away. I wrote to the Sparks fansite and thanked them for the experience." [...] Wennersten subsequently travelled to Los Angeles as a journalist, to attend and report on another Sparks concert. By that time, the idea of a collaboration had formed in her mind: [...] "I always dreamed of dragging them into the radio world." ...|$|E

500|$|Historian Eric Reed {{notes that}} a DuPont {{marketing}} executive characterized the initial sponsorship as [...] "a bargain", {{and that the}} company claimed that the American press clippings generated by the event weighed [...] DuPont executives also reported that they valued the global media exposure as worth close to US$70 million. Reed quotes a DuPont marketing executive as stating: [...] "In 40 years in , I have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> concentrated, sustained and positive media coverage". However, Reed argues that despite this initial enthusiasm, [...] "the Tour DuPont's chronic weaknesses hamstrung the event's growth", citing its [...] "pro-am" [...] status, which prevented professional riders {{from being able to}} win world ranking points in the event. He also states that despite having an estimated worldwide television audience of 200 million, [...] "American fan enthusiasm and roadside spectator interest in the event failed to spike significantly".|$|E
500|$|During 1884, the 44-year-old Tchaikovsky {{began to}} shed the unsociability and restlessness that had plagued him since his {{abortive}} marriage in 1878, and which had {{caused him to}} travel incessantly throughout Russia and Western Europe. In March 1884, Tsar Alexander III conferred upon him the Order of St. Vladimir (fourth class), which carried with it hereditary nobility, and won Tchaikovsky a personal audience with the Tsar. The Tsar's decoration was a visible seal of official approval, which helped Tchaikovsky's rehabilitation from the stigma associated with the conditions of his marriage. This rehabilitation may have been cemented in the composer's mind {{with the success of}} his Third Orchestral Suite at its January 1885 premiere in St. Petersburg, under Hans von Bülow's direction. Tchaikovsky wrote to his patroness Nadezhda von Meck: [...] "I have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> a triumph. I saw the whole audience was moved, and grateful to me. These moments are the finest adornments of an artist's life. Thanks to these it is worth living and laboring." [...] The press was likewise unanimously favorable.|$|E
500|$|Painter Maqbool Fida Hussain {{found his}} muse in Madhuri Dixit after {{watching}} the part of Hum Aapke Hai Koun...! where [...] "Didi Tera Devar Deewana" [...] is performed. He went on to watch the film 67 times. About Dixit's dance in the song Hussain confessed, [...] "That movement of the hips is out of this world. I have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> a dancer, and I have seen the best. Her words are transformed into body language." [...] He painted a series of paintings inspired from Dixit. Madhuri as Menaka with Vishwamitra, Madhuri as Radha with Nand Lala, Madhuri playing tennis at Wimbledon were some of those paintings. The Menaka painting was inspired from the famous painting of apsara Menaka as painted by Raja Ravi Verma. Another painting also showed Dixit with Meryl Streep leaning over a bridge in Madison County and Clint Eastwood on horseback below. The painting Nautanki showed Dixit with a backless blouse turning behind like the step in [...] "Didi Tera Devar Deewana", however this time sporting a nine yards Maharashtrian saree.|$|E

500|$|During Governor Shelby's term, the General Assembly {{had passed}} laws {{requiring}} that the governor, auditor, treasurer, {{and secretary of}} state live in Frankfort and allocating a sum of 100 pounds to rent living quarters for the governor. Shortly after Garrard took office, the state commissioners of public buildings reported to the legislature that it would be more financially sensible to construct a house for the governor and his large family than to rent living quarters for them for the duration of his term. On December 4, 1796, the General Assembly passed legislation appropriating 1,200 pounds for the construction of such a house. The state's first governor's mansion was completed in 1798. Garrard incited considerable public interest when, in 1799, he commissioned a local craftsman to build a piano for one of his daughters; most Kentuckians had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> a grand instrument, and a considerable number of them flocked to the governor's mansion to see it when it was finished. Kentucky historian Thomas D. Clark also relates that Garrard's addition of carpeting to the mansion [...] a rare amenity at the time [...] drew many visitors and was described by one as [...] "the envy and pride of the community".|$|E
500|$|While {{ultimately}} an Israeli victory, the Battle of the Chinese Farm has {{an especially}} infamous legacy among Israeli participants, {{and it is}} remembered {{as one of the}} most brutal battles of the war—and for the heavy losses incurred by both the Egyptians and Israelis. After the battle had ended, Dayan visited the area of the battlefield. Reshef, who accompanied him, said, [...] "Look at this valley of death." [...] The minister, taken aback by the great destruction before him, muttered in an undertone, [...] "What you people have done here!" [...] Later, Dayan would recount that: [...] "I am no novice at war or battle scenes, but I have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> a sight, not in reality, or in paintings, or in the worst war movies. Here was a vast field of slaughter stretching as far as the eye could see." [...] Sharon would also provide his own poignant account of the aftermath: [...] "It was as if a hand-to-hand battle of armor had taken place... Coming close you could see the Egyptian and Jewish dead lying side-by-side, soldiers who had jumped from their burning tanks and died together. No picture could capture the horror of the scene, none could encompass what had happened there." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{follows from}} the causal theory of reference. Words always refer {{to the kinds of}} things they were coined to refer to, thus the kinds of things their user, or the user's ancestors, {{experience}}d. So, if some person, Mary, were a [...] "brain in a vat", whose every experience is received through wiring and other gadgetry created by the [...] "mad scientist", then Mary's idea of a [...] "brain" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] brain, since she and her linguistic community have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> a thing. Rather, she saw something that looked like a brain, but was actually an image fed to her through the wiring. Similarly, her idea of a [...] "vat" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] vat. So, if, as a brain in a vat, she were to say [...] "I'm a brain in a vat", she would actually be saying [...] "I'm a brain-image in a vat-image", which is incoherent. On the other hand, if she is not a brain in a vat, then saying that she is a brain in a vat is still incoherent, but now because she actually means the opposite. This is a form of epistemological externalism: knowledge or justification depends on factors outside the mind and is not solely determined internally.|$|E
