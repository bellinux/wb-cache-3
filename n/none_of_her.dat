5|$|Anitha {{tells the}} king {{that she is}} the {{messenger}} sent from the homeland. Muthu and Lavanya are enslaved while Anitha is given a chance to prove herself. She tries to seduce and convince the Chola king to march towards the homeland in two days so he can be crowned properly as a king. He suspects her bona fides since <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> actions match those described by the king's ancestors. The ancestors wrote that the messenger will be preceded by hail and following his ill-treatment will eventually help the tribe.|$|E
5|$|Ferrier's discography {{consists}} of studio recordings originally {{made on the}} Columbia and Decca labels, and recordings taken from live performances which were later issued as discs. In the years since her death, many of her recordings have received multiple reissues on modern media; between 1992 and 1996 Decca issued the Kathleen Ferrier Edition, incorporating much of Ferrier's recorded repertoire, on 10 compact discs. The discographer Paul Campion has drawn attention to numerous works which she performed but did not record, or for which no complete recording has yet surfaced. For example, only one aria from Elgar's Dream of Gerontius, and <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> renderings of 20th century songs by Holst, Bax, Delius and others were recorded. Only {{a small part of}} her St John Passion was captured on disc.|$|E
5|$|Zeta-Jones {{significantly}} decreased her workload in {{the late}} 2000s. She made her Broadway debut in 2009 {{with the role of}} an ageing actress in the musical A Little Night Music, which won her the Tony Award for Best Actress. After a three-year absence from the screen, she had three film releases each in 2012 and 2013. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> releases in 2012 performed well. This changed in 2013, when she played a mysterious psychiatrist in Soderbergh's critically acclaimed thriller Side Effects and a Russian agent in the financially successful action film Red 2. After another three-year sabbatical, Zeta-Jones starred in the British film Dad's Army (2016), based on the television sitcom of the same name. In 2017, she returned to television by portraying the actress Olivia de Havilland in the anthology series Feud.|$|E
6000|$|It was warm, and <b>none</b> <b>of</b> them {{connected}} <b>her</b> withdrawal {{with the}} reminiscences of the dairyman. He went forward {{and opened the}} door for her, saying with tender raillery-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{recollect}} {{it quite}} well.' Her heart was horrified {{and she thought}} Lord Mountclere must be developing into an inquisitor, which perhaps he was. But <b>none</b> <b>of</b> this reached <b>her</b> face.|$|R

5|$|Halperin {{cautioned that}} Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, {{and some of}} the {{statements}} about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> other suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical, as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again. In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944, Monroe met {{photographer}} David Conover, who {{had been}} sent by the U.S. Army Air Forces' First Motion Picture Unit (FMPU) to the factory to shoot morale-boosting pictures of female workers. Although <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> pictures were used by the FMPU, she quit working at the factory in January 1945 and began modeling for Conover and his friends. She moved out of her in-laws' home, defying them and her husband, and {{signed a contract with}} the Blue Book Model Agency in August 1945. She began to occasionally use the name Jean Norman when working, and had her curly brunette hair straightened and dyed blonde to make her more employable. Her figure was deemed more suitable for pin-up than fashion modeling, and she was featured mostly in advertisements and men's magazines. According to the agency's owner, Emmeline Snively, Monroe was one of its most ambitious and hard-working models; by early 1946, she had appeared on 33 magazine covers for publications such as Pageant, U.S. Camera, Laff, and Peek.|$|E
25|$|U-158 was sunk on 30 June 1942, {{west of the}} Bermudas, in {{position}} , by depth charges from a PBM Mariner aircraft commanded by Richard Schreder of United States Navy Squadron VP-74. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> 54 crewmen on board survived the sinking.|$|E

60|$|Alas, no! But I did not write. I {{tried and}} failed. And then I tried to forget. I was {{constant}} {{at all the}} gayeties, gave every miss in town a share of my attention, rode to hounds once a week at Whitehall or the South River Club with a dozen young beauties. But cantering through the winter mists 'twas Dolly, in her red riding-cloak and white beaver, I saw beside me. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> them had <b>her</b> seat in the saddle, and <b>none</b> <b>of</b> them <b>her</b> light hand on the reins. And tho' they lacked not fire and skill, they had not my lady's dash and daring to follow over field and fallow, stream and searing, and be in at the death with heightened colour, but never a look away.|$|R
25|$|Two {{collections}} of Brennan's short stories {{were published in}} her lifetime: In and Out of Never-Never Land was published in 1969 and Christmas Eve was published in 1974. These collections were well received in the U.S.A., but they were no paperback editions. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> books were published in Ireland or the UK.|$|E
25|$|Polo {{embarked}} on many foreign trips during her time as first lady. She first traveled to Portugal in 1950, and returned in 1958 and 1967. She traveled to Rome in May 1950, {{to witness the}} canonization of Antonio María Claret. During the visit, she was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII. On <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> trips abroad was she ever accompanied by her husband.|$|E
25|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union, Tereshkova lost her political office but <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> prestige. To this day, she is revered as a hero, and to some her importance in Russian space history is only surpassed by Yuri Gagarin and Alexey Leonov. She was elected to the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian legislature, in 2011 as a member of United Russia where she continues to serve.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1900s the Muruzi House {{acquired}} {{the reputation of}} being one of the Russian capital's new cultural centers. Guests recognized and admired the hostess's authority and her talent for leadership, even if <b>none</b> <b>of</b> them found <b>her</b> particularly warm or affectionate.|$|R
5000|$|She was {{eventually}} named the paper's [...] "Women's Editor," [...] but soon {{came to understand}} that she had run afoul of the paper's glass ceiling; when she asked her managing editor what her future was with the paper, she was told she had <b>none</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>her</b> current position, ostensibly due to her radical political views which were outside those traditionally held by the paper.|$|R
50|$|Retired {{at the end}} of 1997, Bosra Sham was bred to many leading stallions and {{produced}} several winners, but <b>none</b> <b>of</b> them top-class. <b>Her</b> best foal was probably Rosberg, by A. P. Indy, who won the Canadian Grade III Premier's Stakes at Hastings Park.|$|R
25|$|Initially, Zewditu was not {{permitted}} to exercise power herself. Instead, her cousin Ras Tafari Makonnen was appointed regent, and her father's old loyal general, Fitawrari Hapte Giorgis Dinagde was made commander-in-chief of the army. Ras Tafari was also made heir apparent to Zewditu, for <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> children had survived to adulthood. In 1928, after an attempt to remove Ras Tafari Makonnen from power failed, the Empress was compelled to crown her cousin Negus.|$|E
25|$|Melvin Delos Mars was {{the first}} African-American woman to have an opera she {{composed}} produced: Leoni, the Gypsy Queen in Providence, Rhode Island in 1889. She went on to compose and star in four more full length operettas which were staged in either Boston, Massachusetts or Providence, Rhode Island between 1880–1896, including Fun At A Boarding School, and Love In Disguise; or, Things Are Not What They Seem. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> works survive.|$|E
25|$|Although {{many people}} believe that Krasner stopped working in the 1940s in order to nurture Pollock's home life and career, she never stopped {{creating}} art. Throughout her career, she went through periods of struggle where she would experiment with new styles that would satisfy her means for expression and harshly critique, revise, or destroy the work she would produce. Because of her self-criticism, there are periods of time where little to <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> work exists, specifically the late 1940s and early 1950s.|$|E
60|$|The King. He'll take no harm of it. I'll follow presently..... He's all his mother's now and <b>none</b> <b>of</b> mine-- <b>Her</b> very {{face on the}} bride-pillow. Yet I tricked her. But {{that was}} later--and she never guessed. I do not think he sinned much--he's too young-- Much {{the same age as}} my Queen. God must not judge him Too hardly for such slips as youth may fall in. But I'll entreat that Throne.|$|R
50|$|Retired to broodmare duty at Issam Fares' Haras de Manneville in Banneville-la-Campagne, France, Miss Alleged {{produced}} thirteen offspring, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> which achieved <b>her</b> racing success. She suffered complications {{after giving}} birth to her thirteenth foal in 2008, {{and had to be}} humanely euthanized on February 28.|$|R
6000|$|The dame of dames! can I believe then, [...] Those ancient temples, sculptures classic, could <b>none</b> <b>of</b> them retain <b>her?</b> [...] Nor {{shades of}} Virgil and Dante, nor myriad memories, poems, old [...] associations, {{magnetize}} {{and hold on}} to her? [...] But that she's left them all--and here? ...|$|R
25|$|On January 14, 1893, the Queen {{met with}} her cabinet at Iolani Palace to discuss her {{proposed}} constitution. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> ministers agreed {{to sign the}} constitution, believing that having the Queen simply proclaim a new constitution would spark unrest. The ministers {{went so far as}} to inform the Queen's political enemies of her plans, and were afraid of her threats of mob violence if they didn't follow her orders. The Queen finally gave in late that afternoon, but the wheels of her overthrow had already been set in motion.|$|E
25|$|Lulu is {{diagnosed}} with aplastic anemia and needs {{a bone marrow}} transplant, but <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> family members are a match. Laura's son by Stavros Cassidine, Nikolas, donates his bone marrow {{at a hospital in}} Switzerland. Nikolas arrives in Port Charles with his uncle Stefan (Stephen Nichols) where they decide to stay, creating tension in the Spencer family, especially when Stefan begins to romance Bobbie. Stefan had been Laura's only friend during her captivity. The two had developed romantic feelings for each other and were lovers. When he married Bobbie, Laura knew it was to make her jealous.|$|E
25|$|In {{a kingdom}} where the Salic Law {{excluded}} women from succession to the throne, Catherine had overcome prejudice against government {{by a woman}} and been elected governor (gouvernante) of France with sweeping powers. However, she accepted that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> three daughters would ever inherit the French throne. By 1572, only two of her sons remained alive, she brokered a marriage between her daughter Margaret and Henry, who, in that year, became King Henry III of Navarre {{after the death of}} his mother, Jeanne d'Albret, while buying clothes for the wedding in Paris. The marriage was intended to unite the interests of the house of Valois with the house of Bourbon.|$|E
60|$|Again {{and again}} the frigate fired, but she was two miles away and, though the shot went {{skipping}} over the water near the brig, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> them struck <b>her.</b> The men, unable to understand why they were running the gauntlet of the frigate's fire, looked inquiringly towards the poop.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where is it?" [...] she said, popping <b>her</b> {{head out}} <b>of</b> the window. The morning-glories only danced lightly on their stems, the robins chirped shrilly {{in the garden}} below, and the wind gave Daisy a kiss; but <b>none</b> <b>of</b> them {{answered}} <b>her,</b> and still the lovely music sounded close beside her.|$|R
60|$|But Peter {{must have}} a cent. Felicity would have given him one herself--and she was <b>none</b> too lavish <b>of</b> <b>her</b> coppers--rather than have him go without one. Dan, however, lent him one, on the {{distinct}} understanding that {{it was to be}} repaid the next week.|$|R
25|$|George {{stops in}} AD 802,701 {{near the base}} of a towering sphinx. He goes {{exploring}} and finds a group of delicate young men and women with simple clothing gathered at a stream. One woman, carried off by the current, screams for help but <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> companions show any concern. George rescues her and is surprised when, revived, she walks away without a word; she later seeks him out and gives him a flower. She says her name is Weena (Yvette Mimieux) and tells George her people are called the Eloi. The Eloi do not operate machines, work, or read, and know little of mankind's history.|$|E
25|$|Constantia's {{poems are}} few and far between, yet the ones still in {{circulation}} are seen as proof of her intelligence. Many poems, epigrams, and occasional pieces flowed from her facile pen—written in Latin, Greek, or English; but as they did not come up to her standard of excellence, she burnt them all before her death. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> poems have been preserved, save a few which she addressed to various friends, notably to Mrs. Barber, and which are too personal to be quoted as they could not possess any interest for the general reader; and, on the other hand, it would be unfair to give them as specimens of Mrs. Grierson's poetical abilities.|$|E
25|$|The queen founded orphanages, and in 1809 {{became the}} patron (providing new funding) of the General Lying-in Hospital, a {{hospital}} for expectant mothers. It was subsequently renamed as the Queen's Hospital, and is today the Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital. The education of women was of great importance to her, and she ensured that her daughters were better educated than was usual for young women of the day; however, she also insisted that her daughters live restricted lives close to their mother, and she refused {{to allow them to}} marry until they were well-advanced in years. As a result, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> daughters had legitimate issue (one, Princess Sophia, may have had an illegitimate son).|$|E
6000|$|... "The Duchess," [...] Borrowdean continued, [...] "undertook to {{discover}} from you what prospects there were, if any, of your return to political life. She took <b>none</b> <b>of</b> us into <b>her</b> confidence. We <b>none</b> <b>of</b> us knew what means {{she meant to}} employ. She disappeared. She communicated with <b>none</b> <b>of</b> us. We <b>none</b> <b>of</b> us had the least idea what had become <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> Time went on, and we began {{to get a little}} uneasy. We had a meeting and it was arranged that I should come down and see you. I came, I saw you, I saw the Duchess! The situation very soon became clear to me. Instead of the Duchess converting you, you had very nearly converted the Duchess." ...|$|R
50|$|During {{an attack}} on a convoy on 26 November, Tinosa sank Japanese cargo ship Shini Maru and then dodged 34 depth charges, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> which caused <b>her</b> any damage.

6000|$|... "Back her off, lads!" [...] {{the mate}} cried. As the boat glided off into deep water again {{there was a}} yell from the shore, and a dozen spears struck the water round <b>her.</b> Fortunately <b>none</b> <b>of</b> them struck <b>her,</b> for she was {{invisible}} to the natives, who had been guided to the spot {{by the sound of}} the oars.|$|R
