25|$|While many mathematicians before Galois gave {{consideration}} to what are {{now known as}} groups, it was Galois {{who was the first}} to use the word group (in French groupe) in a sense close to the technical sense that is understood today, making him among the founders of the branch of algebra known as group theory. He developed the concept that is today known as a <b>normal</b> <b>subgroup.</b> He called the decomposition of a group into its left and right cosets a proper decomposition if the left and right cosets coincide, which is what today is known as a <b>normal</b> <b>subgroup.</b> He also introduced the concept of a finite field (also known as a Galois field in his honor), in essentially the same form as it is understood today.|$|E

25|$|Isometries {{requiring}} an {{odd number}} of mirrors — reflection and glide reflection — always reverse left and right. The even isometries — identity, rotation, and translation — never do; they correspond to rigid motions, {{and form a}} <b>normal</b> <b>subgroup</b> of the full Euclidean group of isometries.
