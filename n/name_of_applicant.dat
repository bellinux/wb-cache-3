[...] - The following review of the work appeared in Library Quarterly 20 : 3 (July 1950), pp. 213 - 215 : 2 ̆ 2 Numerical Index to the Bibliography of Scientific and Industrial Reports, 2 ̆ 2 Vols. I-X (1946 - 48). Edited by the SCIENCE-TECHNOLOGY GROUP, SPECIAL LIBRARIES ASSOCIATION. New York: Special Libraries Association, 1949. Pp. viii+ 522. 10. 00. (Litho-printed.) This is the best, the most complete, and the most useful of all the indexes that have yet appeared for the incomparable Bibliography of Scientific and Industrial Reports issued by the Office of Technical Services, United States Department of Commerce. The work is important in its own right not merely as an index but also, in adept hands, as a reference tool. But, first, a few words about the publication which it indexes. The Bibliography of Scientific and Industrial Reports is the most unusual source of scientific and technological information that has ever been presented to the learned and scientific world. This is not a bibliography in the usual sense, i. e., of printed and published material available in reasonable abundance; on the contrary, it is a listing and abstracting of materials of which most of the earlier titles have not even been published, even a lesser part printed, and vast quantities exist only (except for photoduplication) in unique typewritten reports or on film in one of the three libraries selected as their depositories. To quote Ralph R. Shaw: 2 ̆ 2 Most of it is available in manuscript form only, or in a single, poor, microfilm copy. 2 ̆ 2 Thanks to those courageous men who had the vision to grasp the scientific and research potentials of this material, the learned world received more literature with which to work than there are trained scientists to use it. The project has opened vast sources of information that hitherto either had been sealed in the secret vaults of such institutions as the German Patent Office, I. G. Farben, and Krupp; had been held in military secrecy; or for some other reason had not been disseminated throughout the world of learning and technology. The Bibliography, therefore, is a most unusual collective addition to human knowledge and, as such, to human power. 1 In the light of this background, the 2 ̆ 2 Index 2 ̆ 2 under review takes on added importance. Even before the first volume of the Bibliography was completed, the need for a numerical index was apparent. At the present time, with footnote citations and bibliographical references being cited by PB numbers 2 or by 2 ̆ 2 correlated 2 ̆ 2 reports in the world 2 ̆ 7 s scientific and technical literature, the 2 ̆ 2 Index 2 ̆ 2 has become indispensable. The Science-Technology Group of the Special Libraries Association, Philadelphia chapter, early recognized this need, and the initial organization to this end was set up under the direction of Mr. Kenneth H. Fagerhaugh, now research librarian at the John Crerar Library, though his name is omitted from the prefatory commendations. The project was carried to completion under the chairmanship of Miss Anne L. Nicholson. The present work indexes by PB numbers the abstracts, reports, patents, etc., listed in the first ten volumes of the Bibliography, covering the years 1946 - 48. This objective has been achieved admirably. Further, it shows at once how completely the numbered reports are in-dexed, though it must be understood, and has been amply publicized, that {{only a small part of}} the tons of material collected, running to billions of pages, can possibly be listed. There are surprisingly few breaks in the numbering sequence; moreover, cancellations are indicated by XXXX. The PB index is followed by the numerical indexes to German and Japanese patents. In the neighborhood of fifteen thousand German patents, most of which are not listed in Chemical Abstracts, appear here for the first time outside the German Patent Office. Of Japanese patents more than five hundred are listed. The wealth of the German patent material can be estimated from the fact that, for the first time in history, I. G. Farben chemical patents are being revealed to the world, according to Dr. Julius Alsberg, chief of the Technical and Industrial Intelligence Division of OTS, and thousands of other German patents are being made known outside the German Patent Office. Next follow the 2 ̆ 2 Correlations with PB numbers 2 ̆ 2 for B. I. O. S. Final Reports, C. I. O. S. Evaluation Reports, C. I. O. S. Roman Numeral Series, F. D. Reports, F. I. A. T. Final Reports, M. D. D. C. and A. E. C. D. Reports, and, finally, O. S. R. D. Reports. 3 According to the Preface, this part has been supplied by Mr. O. Willard Holloway and Mrs. Dorothy Graf, both of the Library Division of the OTS. Since the index proper is by PB numbers only, the importance of these 2 ̆ 2 correlations 2 ̆ 2 is obvious. In the hands of a capable user, this can prove to be an invaluable part of the 2 ̆ 2 Index. 2 ̆ 2 It is regrettable that not more series have been so correlated. Must we assume that demand and/or service failed to justify carrying these corre-lations further? 4 A highly useful section is the 2 ̆ 2 Index to Classified German Patent Applications, 2 ̆ 2 again by O. Willard Holloway and Dorothy Graf (pp. 497 - 5 I 7). These German patent applications are on film and listed by PB numbers. Outside the German Patent Office they can probably be found only through the Bibliography. And that is where the classification becomes important. A patent consultant or applicant can peruse the appropriate classifications by means of the index; as to dates, according to the Preface, the United States Commissioner of Patents has ruled that 2 ̆ 2 the date of release following declassification is the effective date of publication within the meaning of the statutes. 2 ̆ 25 First are given the class numbers and what they stand for; then follow the reel numbers with PB numbers arranged according to classes. Moreover, printed volumes containing title of the application, application number, and <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>applicant</b> are available from the OTS. Each volume covers a specific class or classes. Twelve of these volumes were available as of January, 1949, and a table on pages 500 - 501 of the 2 ̆ 2 Index 2 ̆ 2 lists them by classes indexed, by PB number, by volume and page where described in the Bibliography, and by price. These volumes in themselves add materially to the reference literature on German patents. The work concludes with a 2 ̆ 2 Bibliography: Subject Indices, Classified Lists, Correlations 2 ̆ 2 (pp. 519 - 22), available from various government offices and elsewhere. Emory C.
