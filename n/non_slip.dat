40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} a {{simulation}} framework which simultaneously computes both {{the design and}} the control of bipedal walkers. The problem of computing a design and a control is formulated as a single large-scale parametric optimal control problem on hybrid dynamics with path constraints (e. g. non sliding and <b>non</b> <b>slipping</b> contact constraints). Our framework relies on state-of-the-art numerical optimal control techniques and efficient computation of the multi-body rigid dynamics. It allows to compute both the parametrized model and the control of passive walkers on different scenarios, in only few seconds on a standard computer. The framework is illustrated by several examples which highlight {{the interest of the}} approach...|$|R
40|$|O trabalho apresenta inicialmente os conceitos clássicos de rolamento (sem escorregamento e sem pivotamento) de uma superfície sobre outra usando os triedros de Darboux das duas superfícies ao longo das respectivas curvas de contato. Mostra, ainda, a equivalência desses conceitos com outras definições. A seguir, estuda-se a controlabilidade no problema do rolamento de uma esfera sobre uma superfície S de revolução, tanto no caso de rolar sem escorregar como no caso de não escorregar e não pivotar; a controlabilidade visa determinar a atingibilidade entre dois 'estados' da esfera (posição em S e orientação), isto é, de elementos do espaço das configurações S×SO(3). Na seqüência, estabelecem-se condições nos controles para que os rolamentos sem escorregamento e sem pivotamento ocorram sobre geodésicas de S e obtém-se, também, a controlabilidade nesta situação. Finalmente, verifica-se que, quando S é um plano, 3 ou 4 rolamentos retilíneos, sem escorregamento e sem pivotamento, são suficientes para garantir a atingibilidade entre dois estados da esfera. This work starts by {{presenting}} the classical concepts of rolling (without slipping and without slipping or twisting) of a surface over another one, using the Darboux referential frames {{of the two}} surfaces along their contact curves. It shows the equivalence between these concepts with other definitions. In the sequel one studies the controllability in the rolling problem of a ball over a surface of revolution S, including both: the <b>non</b> <b>slipping</b> and the <b>non</b> <b>slipping</b> or twisting cases; controllability aims to determine the reachability between two 'states'of the ball (position on S and orientation), that is, two elements of the configuration space S × SO(3). It follows by establishing conditions on controls in order that the rollings occur along geodesics of S and by studying the controllability in this situation. Finally, it is shown that if S is the plane, 3 or 4 retilinear moves without slipping or twisting are enough to guarantee reachability between two states of the ball...|$|R

Calculations of stability are made on two models : one model of "poussée et butée" (push and thrust ?) and one model by the methode of perturbations on a <b>non</b> circular <b>slip</b> plane. They prove that the security coefficient F decreases of 3 to 5 % when the foot of the cliff moves 5 m backwards. Several studies are necessary to foresee and prevent new slips...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presented}} {{a study on}} the behavior of an embankment, 5. 0 m high, reinforced with geogrids, and constructed over a soft soil 7. 0 m thick. In order to determine the design strength (T d) of the reinforcement, it was carried out a limit equilibrium analysis using the following methods: Simplified Bishop (1955) and Corrected Janbu (1954), for the hypothesis of circular and <b>non</b> circular <b>slip</b> surfaces respectively. In order to verify the behavior of the reinforced embankment, finite element analyses were performed using the software Phase 2. Therefore, this work presented the determination of the reinforcement load design, verification of the magnitude of reinforcement strains, determination of the plastification zones in the foundation soil due to the elevation of the compacted soil, and values of distortion and horizontal displacement of the soft soil and mechanism of mobilization of reinforcement load.    </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the whole strong earthquake recurrence behaviors of two fault zones along the Kefallinia Transform, Ionian Sea, Greece, using seismological data and statistical methods. Our data include 29 events with M> 515 {{for the period}} 1636 ～ 2003. We found different recurrence behaviors for the Kefallinia Fault Zone (clustering and time 2 predictable recurrence behaviors) and the Lefkada Fault Zone (near random and <b>non</b> 2 <b>slip</b> 2 predictable or non 2 time 2 predictable recurrence nature). The different modes may be attributed to: (a) segment interaction along 2 strike (Kefallinia) by static triggering and (b) the influence of fault systems {{to the north and}} east on the recurrence on Lefkada. Within the active periods, earthquake recurrence intervals are distributed in a more dispersed fashion, and can be fitted well by a Weibull distribution. In contrast, the distribution of the quiet periods is relatively less dispersed and diff icult to describe by suitable probability functions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCavitation {{behaviors}} of fine grained AZ 31 alloy sheet during high temperature blow forming {{have been investigated}} in terms of deformation and microstructure evolution. Especially, effect of hydrostatic stress by applying backward pressure on blow formability has been investigated by examining cavitation behavior. A commercial grade AZ 31 magnesium alloy sheet with the grain size of 15 μm could have an elongation over 300 % over 400 °C. However, elongation did not show a strong strain rate and temperature dependencies which could be easily found in most superplastic aluminum alloys. It might result from that AZ 31 would be vulnerable to cavitation even at the early stage of deformation. It was also found that hydrostatic stress was not effective to prevent evolution of cavities during blow forming, which was much different with the case in most superplastic alloys. Both low strain rate dependency of elongation and ineffectiveness of hydrostatic stress might be originated from poor accommodation slip for grain boundary sliding of AZ 31 even at high temperature where <b>non</b> basal <b>slip</b> systems were activated...|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} a clean room mat is to keep sterile the areas that require {{ultimate}} protection from dirt, bacteria and any contamination brought from outside. Clean room mats are tacky, sticky, <b>non</b> <b>slip</b> mats that possess multiple layers of clean film that effectively capture dirt and dust from foot traffic and wheels. Peel-off mats {{are made up of}} multiple sheets of polyethylene film coated with acrylic adhesive that traps particles. Each layer peels off to reveal a new clean surface. The adhesive backing prevents microbial growth and contamination. Mats used outside clean rooms and laboratories are designed to withhold foreign pollution elements. This goal is achieved by a sticky surface that serves as a barrier for debris, dirt and dust adhered to shoe soles. Clean room sticky mats can contain two defensive barriers: the first part is a carpet itself, while the second part is sticky surface mat. Another mat type to be used to protect rooms from pollution is sanitizing foot bath floor mats. The mat itself is a small bath that contains sanitizing liquid. The foot bath bottom is covered with pliable rubber scrapers for effective cleaning of footwear soles while the liquid disinfects them.|$|E
40|$|The {{first steps}} towards {{developing}} a continuum-molecular coupled simulations techniques are presented, {{for the purpose}} of computing macroscopic systems of confined fluids. The idea is to compute the interface wall-fluid by Molecular Dynamics simulations, where Lennard-Jones potential (and others) have been employed for the molecular interactions, so the usual <b>non</b> <b>slip</b> boundary condition is not specified. Instead, a shear rate can be imposed at the wall, which allows to obtain the properties of the wall material by means of an iterative method. The remaining fluid region will be computed by a spectral hp method. We present MD simulations of a Couette flow, and the results of the developed boundary conditions from the wall fluid interaction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The {{algorithm}} formula in explicit {{format for}} the maneuver of wheeled mobile robot (WMR) with four steered independently driven wheels (4 WS 4 WD) is rarely discussed. Based on {{the constraints of}} pure rolling and <b>non</b> <b>slip,</b> the existence of ICR (Instantaneous Center of Rotation) has been proofed toward this class of robots. A generic maneuver algorithm based on ICR (including the direction of rotation) has been presented in explicit format. And a generic maneuver algorithm with constraints has also been investigated explicitly to limit the orientation range of steering wheels. Several typical maneuver modes with rotation direction have been drawn from the generic maneuver algorithm mentioned above. Results from simulation and tests are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of proposed algorithms. Key-Words:- mobile robot, generic maneuver algorithm, instantaneous center of rotation...|$|E
40|$|The viscoplastic {{behaviour}} of two {{batches of}} commercially pure titanium with different oxygen contents was characterized {{at room temperature}} through tension, creep, relaxation, and strain rate jumps tests along the rolling and transverse directions. Depending on the applied stress, creep saturated, or the primary creep stage was followed by secondary and even tertiary creep leading to fracture within a few hours. 33 to 40 % of the flow stress was relaxed within 20 hours. The strain rate sensitivity was found to increase with the oxygen content and when the strain-rate-decreased. It was up to 25 % higher along the transverse direction than along the rolling direction. The experimental data were used to identify a simple mean field crystal viscoplasticity model. Assuming different viscosities on prismatic and <b>non</b> prismatic <b>slip</b> systems, the anisotropy and strain rate dependence of the strain rate sensitivity were captured. As a consequence of these different viscosities, the relative contributions of each type of slip system to the overall deformation are predicted to vary with the strain rate, in accordance with some data from the literature...|$|R
40|$|Learning Strategies, Language Forms, and Illocutionary Functions in Arabic Speaking Skills The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to reveal the kinds and application of language learning strategies in developing Arabic speaking skills, the language forms produced as represented by the complexity of sentences and the oral fluency, and the illocutionary functions in the Arabic speech. The data were analyzed using the theories on learning strategies, psycholinguistics, and speech act. The findings ob­tained were as follows. The kinds of language learning strategies used included the memory, cognitive compensation, metacognitive, affective, and social strategies, as well as two other strategies. The types of sentences produced were simple sentences, sentences without clauses, compound sentences, and compound complex sentences. The Arabic speech was less fluent moving to fluent, with a number of speech impediments, that is, pauses, repetitions, correction, <b>non</b> functional words, <b>slips</b> of the tongue, and stutter. Three illocution­ary functions were found in the Arabic speech, namely, representative, di­rective and expressive functions...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{contains}} {{modeling and}} nonlinear automatic control of an autonomous lawn mower. The vehicle shall {{be able to}} follow a magnetic field loop buried in the lawn on an arbitrary distance, including straddling. A unicycle model of the lawn mower has been derived based on previous work. The model holds for the assumption of <b>non</b> <b>slip</b> environment. Two diff erent control strategies have been implemented and evaluated in this thesis. One is based on feedback linearization  and with the feedback gain estimated using an LQ-controller. The other strategy is based on linearization at an equilibrium point  and also with the use of an LQ-controller. The only state that can be measured is the distance to the magnetic loop. In order to estimate the other states, an observer has been implemented using the linearized in an equilibrium point  model and a Kalman filter. The navigation of the autonomous lawn mower is performed using a magnetic loop buried in the lawn. The non-linearity of the magnetic field causes diffi culties when estimating the distance to the loop. One magnetic field strength corresponds to two distances to the magnetic loop. The nature of the magnetic field and the measurement noise causes the precision of the controller to be limited. The conclusion of this master thesis is {{that it is possible to}} navigate and follow the magnetic loop at a distance greater than 0. 3 [m], but with overshoots during sharp turns. If the reference distance is smaller than that, the behavior of the robot will be oscillating when following the loop. The limitations of the controller performance is due to the lack of information which can be extracted from the measurements of the magnetic field...|$|E
