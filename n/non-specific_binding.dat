2500|$|Since the {{membrane}} has been chosen {{for its ability}} to bind protein and as both antibodies and the target are proteins, steps must be taken to prevent the interactions between {{the membrane}} and the antibody used for detection of the target protein. Blocking of <b>non-specific</b> <b>binding</b> is achieved by placing the membrane in a dilute solution of protein – typically 3–5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) or non-fat dry milk (both are inexpensive) in tris-buffered saline (TBS) or I-Block, with a minute percentage (0.1%) of detergent such as Tween 20 or Triton X-100. Although non-fat dry milk is preferred due to its availability, an appropriate blocking solution is needed as not all proteins in milk are compatible with all the detection bands. [...] The protein in the dilute solution attaches to the membrane in all places where the target proteins have not attached. Thus, when the antibody is added, there is no room on the membrane for it to attach other than on the binding sites of the specific target protein. This reduces background in the final product of the western blot, leading to clearer results, and eliminates false positives.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Non-specific</b> <b>binding</b> of the {{repressor}} to DNA plays {{a crucial}} role in the repression and induction of the Lac-operon. The specific binding site for the Lac-repressor protein is the operator. The non-specific interaction is mediated mainly by charge-charge interactions while binding to the operator is reinforced by hydrophobic interactions. Additionally, there is an abundance of non-specific DNA sequences to which the repressor can bind. Essentially, any sequence that is not the operator, is considered non-specific. Studies have shown, that without the presence of <b>non-specific</b> <b>binding,</b> induction (or unrepression) of the Lac-operon could not occur even with saturated levels of inducer. It had been demonstrated that, without <b>non-specific</b> <b>binding,</b> the basal level of induction is ten thousand times smaller than observed normally. This is because the non-specific DNA acts as sort of a [...] "sink" [...] for the repressor proteins, distracting them from the operator. The non-specific sequences decrease the amount of available repressor in the cell. This in turn reduces the amount of inducer required to unrepress the system.|$|E
5000|$|Lysates {{are complex}} {{mixtures}} of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids, and one must assume that some amount of <b>non-specific</b> <b>binding</b> to the IP antibody, Protein A/G or the beaded support will occur and negatively affect {{the detection of}} the immunoprecipitated target(s). In most cases, preclearing the lysate {{at the start of}} each immunoprecipitation experiment (see step 2 in the [...] "protocol" [...] section below) is a way to remove potentially reactive components from the cell lysate prior to the immunoprecipitation to prevent the <b>non-specific</b> <b>binding</b> of these components to the IP beads or antibody. The basic preclearing procedure is described below, wherein the lysate is incubated with beads alone, which are then removed and discarded prior to the immunoprecipitation [...] This approach, though, does not account for <b>non-specific</b> <b>binding</b> to the IP antibody, which can be considerable. Therefore, an alternative method of preclearing is to incubate the protein mixture with exactly the same components that will be used in the immunoprecipitation, except that a non-target, irrelevant antibody of the same antibody subclass as the IP antibody is used instead of the IP antibody itself. This approach attempts to use as close to the exact IP conditions and components as the actual immunoprecipitation to remove any non-specific cell constituent without capturing the target protein (unless, of course, the target protein non-specifically binds to some other IP component, which should be properly controlled for by analyzing the discarded beads used to preclear the lysate). The target protein can then be immunoprecipitated with the reduced risk of <b>non-specific</b> <b>binding</b> interfering with data interpretation.|$|E

50|$|First, <b>non-specific</b> <b>binding</b> is {{not limited}} to the {{antibody}}-binding sites on the immobilized support; any surface of the antibody or component of the immunoprecipitation reaction can bind to nonspecific lysate constituents, and therefore nonspecific binding will still occur even when completely saturated beads are used.

5000|$|New testing {{platforms}} are now {{developed to}} solve problems related to cellular interactions. These new platforms are much more complex based on multi-compartmental perfused systems. The main objective of these systems is to reproduce in vivo mechanisms more reliably by providing cell culture environment close to the in vivo situation. Each compartment in the system represent a specific organ of the living organism and thus each compartment has a specific characteristics and criteria. Each compartment in these systems are connected by tubes and pumps through which the fluid flows thus mimicking the blood flow in the in vivo situation. The draw back behind {{the use of these}} perfused systems is that, the adverse effects ( [...] influence of both the biological and non-biological components of the system on the fate of the chemical under study) are more compared to the static systems. In order to reduce the effect of non-biological components of the system, all the compartments are made of glass and the connecting tubes are made up of teflon.

This compartmentalization of the midgut provides three general advantages: prevention of <b>non-specific</b> <b>binding</b> of undigested material to the epithelium wall, conservation and concentration of enzymes and substrates and rapid removal of indigestible molecules.|$|E
40|$|While {{non-specific}} DNA {{plays a role}} in target localization {{for many}} recombinases, transcription factors and restriction enzymes, the importance of non-specific DNA interactions for transposases has not been investigated. Here, we discuss non-specific DNA-Tn 5 Transposase (Tnp) interactions and suggest how they stabilize the Tnp and modulate Tnp localization of the 19 bp Tnp recognition end sequences (ESes). DNA protection assays indicate that full-length Tnp interacts efficiently with supercoiled DNA that does not contain ESes. These interactions significantly prolong the lifetime of Tnp, in vitro. The balance between non-specific DNA bound and free Tnp is affected by DNA topology, yet, intermolecular transfer of active Tnp occurs with both supercoiled and linear non-specific DNA. Experiments with substrates of varying lengths show that Tn 5 Tnp can utilize non-specific DNA to facilitate localization of an intramolecular ES over distances less than 464 bp. Finally, synaptic complex formation is inhibited in the presence of increasing concentrations of supercoiled and linear pUC 19. These experiments strongly suggest that Tn 5 Tnp has a robust <b>non-specific</b> DNA <b>binding</b> activity, that <b>non-specific</b> DNA modulates ES sequence localization within the global DNA, most likely through a direct transfer mechanism, and that <b>non-specific</b> DNA <b>binding</b> {{may play a role in}} the cis bias manifested by Tn 5 transposition...|$|R

40|$|Control {{of protein}} {{immobilization}} at sensor surfaces {{is of great}} interest within various scientific fields, since it enables studies of specific biomolecular interactions. To achieve this, one {{must be able to}} immobilize proteins with retained native structure, while minimizing <b>non-specific</b> protein <b>binding.</b> The high affinity interaction between streptavidin (SA) and biotin is extensively used as a linker between a surface, where SA is immobilized, and the (biotinylated) molecule of interest. Self- assembled monolayers (SAMs) of poly- and oligo ethylene glycol (PEG and OEG) derivatives have been proven in literature to minimize <b>non-specific</b> protein <b>binding,</b> and biotin-exposing SAMs have been shown efficient for immobilization of SA. The aim of this master's thesis project was to develop biotinylated gold surfaces for quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) applications through the self-assembly of mixed monolayers of thiolated OEG (or PEG) derivatives with or without a terminal biotin head group. For this, different thiol compounds were to be compared and evaluated. For the systems under study, the required biotin density for maximum specific SA immobilization was to be established, while keeping the non-specific serum adsorption at a minimum. Model experiments with biotinylated proteins immobilized to the SA-functionalized surfaces were to be performed to evaluate the possibilities for commercialization. A protocol for the preparation of a novel biotinylated surface was developed based on the immersion of gold substrates in an ethanolic incubation solution of dithiols with OEG chains (SS-OEG and SS-OEG-biotin, 99 : 1) and found to give reproducible results with respect to low <b>non-specific</b> protein <b>binding</b> and immobilization of a monolayer of SA. The modified surfaces allowed for subsequent immobilization of biotinylated bovine serum albumin (bBSA) and biotinylated plasminogen (bPLG). PLG {{was the subject of a}} challenging case study, using a combination of QCM-D and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), where the immobilized protein was subjected to low molecular weight ligands that were believed to induce conformational changes. The high control of the surface chemistry allowed for the interpretation of the increased dissipation shift upon ligand binding in terms of conformational changes. An obstacle before commercialization of the described biotinylated surfaces is that they do not seem stable for storage > 7 days. The reasons for this have to be investigated further...|$|R
