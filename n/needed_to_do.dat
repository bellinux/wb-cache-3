5|$|After {{the project}} was accepted, Hinoue {{consulted}} Key's former main scenario writer Jun Maeda on various game scenario writers to employ for Rewrite. However, the one writer Hinoue wanted on {{the project was}} Romeo Tanaka, who {{she had become a}} fan of after she played FlyingShine's 2003 visual novel Cross Channel, written by Tanaka. While he did not initially accept the offer, Tanaka decided to take the project when he was given the time he <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the job. When he accepted it, Tanaka was still unaware that Maeda had stepped down as Key's main scenario writer, and he became more interested when he was told that he would write Rewrites overall story.|$|E
5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E
5|$|In April 1999, NSB {{launched}} a new branding scheme for their trains. In addition to Puls for local trains and Agenda for regional trains, the Signatur ("Signature") concept was introduced for intercity trains. Signatur would only be used on the Class 73 services, and consist of two classes, Comfort and Comfort Plus. NSB abolished its branding of only having red trains, and introduced a blue and silver livery on the Class 73 trains. The new service had fewer stops and faster travel times. To {{take advantage of the}} faster speeds, the Norwegian National Rail Administration <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> upgrades to the track, overhead wires and signaling for NOK1.2 billion.|$|E

5|$|International {{and local}} media criticized the {{military}} government for inadequate warnings prior to Giri's landfall in the country. However, the junta claims to have informed the public appropriately. Little assistance had reached thousands of survivors days after the storm's passage, fueling anger from local media sources. Government relief slowly reached the area; however, workers only cleared debris left by the storm and only encouraged residents to rebuild by giving them the supplies <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Further criticism was made about the government withholding information on {{the loss of life}} and scale of damage. Requests were also made to postpone a national election for residents in Arakan State; however, no response was given and the elections were still planned to be held on November7.|$|E

25|$|The {{complete}} {{collapse of}} the German 6th Army and the Romanian 4th Army was more likely caused by {{the inability of the}} numerous horse-drawn infantry divisions to maintain cohesion while retreating and under attack of the Soviet mechanized troops.

25|$|The simple shapes {{made by the}} {{tinsmith}} require tools {{similar to}} a coppersmith. In addition to the big shears anchored in {{a hole in his}} bench he used hand snips and nippers for cutting. The tin was flattened on an anvil made of a block of steel. Straight and curved anvils (stakes) were used to turn and roll the edges of the tin. Solder was then used to join the pieces together; a soldering iron and fire pot were <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this.|$|E

25|$|At first, the Ava court, {{which was}} still {{concerned}} {{about the situation in}} the north, believed that Lower Burma was winnable. The teenage king at Pegu barely controlled one out of the three Mon-speaking regions of Lower Burma. The province of Martaban (Mottama) had been in revolt since 1363, and the Irrawaddy delta under Laukpya had been in revolt since Binnya U's death in January 1384. All Ava <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> it seemed, was to take the Pegu province (present-day Yangon Region and southern Bago Region). The court advised Swa to accept Laukpya's offer.|$|E

Kirkland instructed Taylor {{to meet him at}} the ground two days later to explain. On the same day, Longson accused Clough of making a V-sign at Sir Matt Busby, and demanded that he apologise. Clough refused to do so, as he vehemently denied making the V-sign in the first place.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, cone {{cells are}} less {{sensitive}} to the overall intensity of light, but come in three varieties that are sensitive to different frequency-ranges and thus {{are used in the}} perception of colour and photopic vision. Cone cells are highly concentrated in the fovea and have a high visual acuity meaning that they are better at spatial resolution than rod cells. Since cone cells are not as sensitive to dim light as rod cells, most night vision is limited to rod cells. Likewise, since cone cells are in the fovea, central vision (including the vision <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> most reading, fine detail work such as sewing, or careful examination of objects) is done by cone cells.|$|E
25|$|The shutout win was the Patriots' {{first since}} 2006, while the Patriots' eight passing {{attempts}} were the second fewest in franchise history, behind only the three attempts in the Snowplow Game of 1982.

New England had done what they <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> but unfortunately watched as Miami and Baltimore won their late games and left the Dolphins as the 2008 AFC East champs, the Ravens as a wild card team, and the Patriots missing {{the playoffs for the}} first time since 2002.|$|E
25|$|Robots and {{artificial}} intelligences do not inherently contain or obey the Three Laws; their human creators must choose to program them in, and devise {{a means to}} do so. Robots already exist (for example, a Roomba) that are too simple to understand when they are causing pain or injury and know to stop. Many are constructed with physical safeguards such as bumpers, warning beepers, safety cages, or restricted-access zones to prevent accidents. Even the most complex robots currently produced are incapable of understanding and applying the Three Laws; significant advances in artificial intelligence would be <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, and even if AI could reach human-level intelligence, the inherent ethical complexity as well as cultural/contextual dependency of the laws prevent them from being a good candidate to formulate robotics design constraints. However, as the complexity of robots has increased, so has interest in developing guidelines and safeguards for their operation.|$|E
