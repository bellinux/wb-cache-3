40|$|Objective: To {{review the}} {{incidence}} of neonatal group B streptococcal (GBS) sepsis and its associated risk factors in our obstetrical population. Methods: A computerized perinatal database of over 17, 000 births (from 1992 to 1996) was queried for {{the incidence of}} <b>neonatal</b> GBS <b>sepsis.</b> A more detailed review of 895 births (from {{the first quarter of}} 1997) was undertaken to identify the incidence of risk factors known to be associated with <b>neonatal</b> GBS <b>sepsis.</b> Results: In our institution, 30 cases of <b>neonatal</b> early-onset GBS <b>sepsis</b> were identified in over 17, 000 births (or 1. 7 / 1, 000 deliveries). Risk factors were identified in 17 of those cases (56 %). There were two neonatal fatalities. Chemoprophylaxis was provided in 15 % of the total deliveries. Conclusions: In spite of the lack of a uniform policy for identifying patients suitable for GBS chemoprophylaxis, we found only a 43 % incidence of <b>neonatal</b> GBS <b>sepsis</b> occurring without risk factors present. Identification of antepartum or intrapartum risk factors in our series, therefore, would have identified the majority of cases resulting in <b>neonatal</b> GBS <b>sepsis,</b> which may have benefited from intrapartum therapy. Some negative potential consequences of chemoprophylaxis are discussed, raising questions regarding the recent recommendations of the Centers for Diseas...|$|R
40|$|Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are {{the major}} causative {{microorganisms}} in <b>neonatal</b> nosocomial <b>sepsis.</b> Previous {{studies have shown that}} CoNS <b>sepsis</b> in the <b>neonatal</b> intensive care unit (NICU) is caused by predominant molecular types that are widely distributed among both neonates and staff. Some of these molecular types may persist in the NICU for years. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine the dynamic behavior of CoNS strains causing sepsis over a prolonged period of time by determining the molecular types of all blood isolates from septicemic infants over a period of 11 years (1991 to 2001). The results show that <b>neonatal</b> CoNS <b>sepsis</b> is increasingly caused by a few predominant molecular clusters. The most striking finding was that in recent years one molecular cluster emerged as the predominant cause of <b>neonatal</b> CoNS <b>sepsis,</b> responsible for no less than 31 % (20 of 65) of blood isolates in 2001. Antibiotic resistance, particularly beta-lactam resistance, is probably an important selective force considering the high mecA gene carriage of CoNS blood isolates (70 to 92 %). We conclude that <b>neonatal</b> CoNS <b>sepsis</b> is increasingly caused by a limited number of predominant molecular CoNS types and that antibiotic resistance is probably a major selective force...|$|R
40|$|Maternal {{and child}} health are high {{priorities}} for international development. Through a Review of published work, we show substantial gaps in current knowledge on incidence (cases per live births), aetiology, and risk factors for both maternal and early onset <b>neonatal</b> bacterial <b>sepsis</b> in sub-Saharan Africa. Although existing published data suggest that sepsis causes about 10 % of all maternal deaths and 26 % of neonatal deaths, these {{are likely to be}} considerable underestimates because of methodological limitations. Successful intervention strategies in resource-rich settings and early studies in sub-Saharan Africa suggest that the burden of maternal and early onset <b>neonatal</b> bacterial <b>sepsis</b> could be reduced through simple interventions, including antiseptic and antibiotic treatment. An effective way to expedite evidence to guide interventions and determine the incidence, aetiology, and risk factors for sepsis in sub-Saharan Africa would be through a multiarmed factorial intervention trial aimed at reducing both maternal and early onset <b>neonatal</b> bacterial <b>sepsis</b> in sub-Saharan Africa...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Neonatal</b> <b>sepsis</b> {{is a type}} of {{neonatal}} infection and specifically refers to the presence in a newborn baby of a bacterial blood stream infection (BSI) (such as meningitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, or gastroenteritis) in the setting of fever. Older textbooks may refer to <b>neonatal</b> <b>sepsis</b> as [...] "sepsis neonatorum". Criteria with regards to hemodynamic compromise or respiratory failure are not useful clinically because these symptoms often do not arise in neonates until death is imminent and unpreventable. <b>Neonatal</b> <b>sepsis</b> is divided into two categories: early-onset sepsis (EOS) and late-onset sepsis (LOS). EOS refers to sepsis presenting in the first 7 days of life (although some refer to EOS as within the first 72 hours of life), with LOS referring to presentation of sepsis after 7 days (or 72 hours, depending on the system used). <b>neonatal</b> <b>sepsis</b> {{is the single most important}} cause of neonatal death in hospital as well as community in developing country.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the compliance rate with a maternal riskfactor-based guideline for the prevention of neonatal group B streptococcal (GBS) sepsis. Methods: In August 1994, a risk-factor-based guideline for selective intrapartum prophylaxis against neonatal GBS was adopted by a group model health maintenance organization. This guideline identified the following maternal risk factors for neonatal GBS sepsis: preterm delivery, rupture of membranes for> 18 h, fever/chorioamnionitis, and history of a previous GBS-affected child. Patients with one or more risk factors were to receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis consisting of either ampicillin, erythromycin, or clindamycin. We conducted a retrospective chart review to record risk factors and use of antibiotics. We hypothesized that> 90 % of patients with risk factors would receive intrapartum chemoprophylaxis. Results: A total of 805 maternal charts were reviewed. Of these, 105 (13 %) were candidates for intrapartum prophylaxis. We found an overall compliance rate of 65 %. Compliance rates by risk factor were preterm delivery (51 %), prolonged rupture of membranes (73 %), fever/chorioamnionitis (87 %), and previous affected child (100 %). Conclusions: Our results show unexpectedly low compliance rates with a risk-factor-based guideline for the prevention of <b>neonatal</b> GBS <b>sepsis.</b> Only 65 % of women with any risk factor for <b>neonatal</b> GBS <b>sepsis</b> received intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis appropriately.
