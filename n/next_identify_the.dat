The terminology of gradient is misleading here as it refers to a point to point difference between the measured data across the two orbits of the lowest pair of satellites (Swarm A and B). This difference is expressed in the same units as the vector measurements (in nT), which avoids the unnecessarily complication of solving the inverse problem with different data types (the true gradients are in nT/km or nT/degree). Considering {{the nature of the}} residuals, and their variations in space and in time, taking the difference between the data from the lower pair of satellites in the East-West direction, spaced about 1.4 degree apart (at the geographic equator, see Friis-Christensen et al., 2006), appears to be an efficient way to mitigate the contributions of large-scale non-lithospheric fields. This gradient however is incomplete since the across difference between the two satellite measurements approximates only the three gradient components along the East-West direction. There is no redundancy with the vector measurements that are still needed to recover the lithospheric field and to stabilize the inverse problem.|$|E
40|$|The {{intracellular}} localization {{and shape}} of the nucleus plays a central role in cellular and developmental processes. In fibroblasts, nuclear movement and shape are controlled by a specific perinuclear actin network made of contractile actin filament bundles called transmembrane actin-associated nuclear (TAN) lines that form a structure called the actin cap. The identification of regulatory proteins associated with this specific actin cytoskeletal dynamic is a priority for understanding actin-based changes in nuclear shape and position in normal and pathological situations. Here, we first identify a unique family of actin regulators, the refilin proteins (RefilinA and RefilinB), that stabilize specifically perinuclear actin filament bundles. We <b>next</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> actin-binding filamin A (FLNA) protein as the downstream effector of refilins. Refilins act as molecular switches to convert FLNA from an actin branching protein into one that bundles. In NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts, the RefilinB/FLNA complex organizes the perinuclear actin filament bundles forming the actin cap. Finally, we demonstrate that in epithelial normal murine mammary gland (NmuMG) cells, the RefilinB/FLNA complex controls formation of a new perinuclear actin network that accompanies nuclear shape changes during the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our studies open perspectives for further functional analyses of this unique actin-based network and shed light on FLNA function during development and in human syndromes associated with FLNA mutations...|$|E

Based upon robust calibration, we show that most of the declining pattern in labour shares in nine EU 15 Member States is governed by capital deepening in conjunction with capital-augmenting technical progress and labour substitution across skill categories. Â Although institutional factors also play a significant role, they appear to be of somewhat less importance. To illustrate the force of the technological explanation we quantitatively assess the dynamic impact of a permanent reduction in the fraction of unskilled employment on the labour share. We find that, for a given elasticity of substitution between the two categories of labour, the more skilled labour is complementary to capital, the more pronounced the decline in the labour share.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we enquire into the essence and mission of Christianity {{in the light}} of the Jamaican historico-cultural experience. Chapter one is devoted to a partial {{investigation}} into the nature of Western Christianity vis-a-vis Western Civilization - the modern dilemma, its historical beginnings and development, its response to philosophical ideas and other cultural positions, Church-State relations, its divisions, and its social attitude. We <b>next</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> major elements in the Jamaican experience as revealed in the impact of the Spanish conquest on the original Arawak population, the enslavement of African Peoples, and the post-slavery repercussions vis-a-vis Western Christianity. In order better to understand the New Testament Gospel we locate its origin in the Old Testament examining its relationship with the Law and Temple, Priesthood and Prophets, observing its social implications, and we follow it en route to the New Testament. In chapter four we engage in a brief examination of the Hellenistic cultural environment including the Jewish Diaspora, in order to have a grasp of the initial interaction between Gospel and Culture. Our concern in chapter five is to recover the essence of Jesus’ proclamation of the Gospel as witnessed to in the Synoptics. From this go on to examine its transmission to the wider Hellenistic milieu, concentrating on the Pauline and Johannine presentations. Finally it is argued that the Gospel in its transmission across cultures should be proclaimed, as far as possible, without cultural accretions; that the prevailing categories and symbols understood within the indigenous Jamaican culture be appreciated and, where possible, appropriated for purposes of communication; and, fundamentally, that in all circumstances the Church should faithfully guarantee a synchronization between its message and action, and Jesus’ Gospel of the Kingdom of God, described in terms of Good News to the Poor...|$|E
40|$|Context. GUI-based {{automation}} {{testing is}} a costly and tedious activity in practice. As GUIs are well-known for being modified and redesigned throughout the development process, the corresponding test scripts are not valid anymore thereby being a hindrance to automation. Hence, substantial effort {{is invested in}} maintaining GUI test scripts which often leads to rework or waste due to improper decisions. As a result, practitioners have identified the need for decision support regarding when should GUI automation testing begin {{and how to make}} it easier and also identify what are the factors leading to waste in GUI-based automation testing. The current literature provides solutions relating to automation in general and few answers for GUI based-automation testing. Such generic answers might not be applicable to GUI test automation and also industries new to GUI development and testing. Thus, it is necessary to validate if the general solutions are applicable to GUI test automation and find additional answers that are not identified previously from practitioners opinions in an industrial context. Objectives. Capture relevant information regarding the current approach for GUI test automation within the subsystems from a case company. <b>Next,</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> criteria for when to begin automation, testability requirements and factors associated with waste from literature and practice. Methods. We conducted a multiple-case study to explore opinions of practitioners in two subsystems at a Swedish telecommunication industry implementing GUI-automation testing. We conducted a literature review to identify answers from scientific literature prior to performing a case study. A two-phased interview was performed with different employees to collect their subjective opinions and also gather their opinions on the evidence collected from the literature. Later, Bayesian synthesis method was used to combine subjective opinions of practitioners with research-based evidence to produce context-specific results. Results. We identified 12 criteria for when to begin automation, 16 testability requirements and 15 factors associated with waste in GUI test automation. Each of them is classified into categories namely SUT-related,test-process related, test-tool related, human and organizational, environment and cross-cutting. New answers which were not present in the existing literature in the domain of the research are found. Conclusions. On validating the answers found in literature, it was revealed that the answers applicable for software test automation, in general, are valid for GUI automation testing as well. Since we incorporated subjective opinions to produce context specific results, we gained an understanding that every practitioner has their own way of working. Hence, this study aids in developing a common understanding to support informed subjective decisions based on evidence...|$|E
40|$|In {{a seminal}} article written almost 50 years ago, Guido Calabresi {{explained}} that risk distribution is an ambiguous concept that {{can refer to}} {{the manner in which}} tort liability affects the allocation of scarce resources, the spreading of losses across society, or the attainment of normatively desirable distributive outcomes. The first two conceptions are combined in the (now) conventional economic analysis of tort law, a methodological approach that is routinely associated with Calabresi. In contrast, the remaining conception of risk distribution that Calabresi identified—the attainment of normatively desirable distributive outcomes—is not ordinarily associated with the economic analysis of tort law, and yet this conception is the one that Calabresi has repeatedly invoked as being of decisive importance. In doing so, Calabresi has described how economic analysis can inform distributive questions within tort law, although he never fully developed this approach. In this article, I try to carry Calabresi further by more rigorously showing how distributive economic analysis can be relevant to the normative evaluation of tort law. In contrast to Calabresi’s conclusion about the “pointlessness of Pareto,” I first argue that the Pareto principle embodies an autonomy-based compensatory norm that tort law can rely on to implement corrective justice under nonideal conditions that foreclose fully consensual compensatory exchanges. Within the context of these forced exchanges, a compensatory payment satisfies a compensatory obligation, which in turn is defined by the correlative compensatory right. Consequently, I <b>next</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> substantive properties of a compensatory tort right and show how the right holder’s compensatory demands can be fully satisfied by the duty holder’s exercise of reasonable care {{in a wide range of}} cases. A compensatory norm can be fully implemented by the distribution of risk without an entitlement to compensatory damages in the event of injury, a conclusion that sheds new light on Calabresi’s original insight about the varied meanings of risk distribution within tort law. Finally, I employ distributive economic analysis to show how the tort system can be conceptualized as a compensatory mechanism. Tort compensation is not merely a form of accident insurance as assumed by the conventional economic analysis of tort law; it fits readily into Calabresi’s taxonomy of desirable legal innovations that shift the Pareto frontier outwards. By expanding the feasible set of fully compensatory outcomes that can be attained under existing social conditions, the tort system enables individuals to engage in new risky activities while adequately compensating those who are disadvantaged by the risky behavior. The tort system has a normative dimension that is brought into sharp relief by the type of distributive economic analysis that has been championed by Calabresi but neglected by the conventional economic analysis of tort law...|$|E

40|$|Natural {{attenuation}} of TCE under aerobic {{conditions at}} the INEEL Test Area North site was demonstrated largely {{on the basis of}} preferential loss of TCE relative to conservative solutes (PCE and H- 3) along groundwater flow paths. First order degradation half-lives were calculated from the rate of preferential TCE loss. We are utilizing the same approach at other DOE sites that have aerobic TCE plumes to determine if aerobic natural attenuation of TCE is rapid enough at these sites to be environmentally significant, i. e. if natural attenuation can reduce concentrations to acceptable levels before groundwater reaches potential receptors. The first step in this process was to identify TCE plumes at DOE sites that have the appropriate site conditions and data needed to perform this analysis. The site conditions include the presence of TCE in groundwater at appreciable concentrations in an aerobic aquifer, a co-mingled contaminant that {{can be used as a}} conservative tracer (e. g. PCE, H- 3, Tc- 99), a flow path that represents at least a decade of travel time, and several monitoring wells located along this flow path. Candidate sites were identified through interviews with knowledgeable individuals in the DOE system and by screening the U. S. Dept. of Energy Groundwater Database using the keywords ''TCE'' and ''groundwater''. The initial screening yielded 25 plumes for consideration. These sites had anywhere from one to 37 individual plumes containing TCE. Of the 25 sites, 13 sites were further evaluated because they met the screening criteria or were promising. After contacting DOE personnel from the respective sites, they were divided into three groups: (1) sites that meet all the project criteria, (2) sites that could potentially be used for the project, and (3) DOE sites that did not meet the criteria. The five sites with plumes that met the criteria were: Brookhaven National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site, and the Savannah River Site. Detailed characterization data from the promising plumes is being entered into our database as it is received. The next step is to calculate natural attenuation half-life values for all of these plumes. We will <b>next</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> plumes in which natural attenuation via aerobic degradation of TCE is fast enough that it may be relevant as a component of a remedy. We will then select at least one of these sites and either modify an existing groundwater transport model or, if necessary, create a new model, for this plume. This model will initially include first order decay of TCE, and degradation will be parameterized using the half-live values determined from the field data. The models will be used to simulate the evolution of the TCE plume and to predict concentrations as a function of time at property lines or other artificial boundaries, and where potential receptors are located. Ultimately rate data from th e laboratory studies being performed at INEEL will be incorporated into this model, as well as the model of the TAN site to provide a realistic prediction of degradation rates and plume longevity. Although identifying suitable TCE plumes and obtaining characterization data has taken longer than expected, this process has successfully identified the plumes needed for the detailed modeling activity without adversely impacting the project budget...|$|E
