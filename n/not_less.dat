5|$|The Constitution {{provides}} that the President may {{refer to a}} tribunal consisting of <b>not</b> <b>less</b> than three judges of the Supreme Court for its opinion any question as {{to the effect of}} any provision of the Constitution that has arisen or appears likely to arise.

5|$|The Tribunal {{consists}} of <b>not</b> <b>less</b> than three judges of the Supreme Court. Its opinions are binding on all other courts. Since the Tribunal {{was established in}} 1994, to date only one constitutional question {{has been referred to}} it. The Tribunal determined in 1995 that although Article 5(2A) was not in force, Article 22H(1) did not prevent Parliament from restricting the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. Since then, there have been several unsuccessful attempts to persuade Cabinet to invoke the Article 100 procedure.|$|E

The minister moving the third reading may also make a speech outlining the changes made to the bill. The bill is then put to the vote. In most cases, a simple majority of Parliament is all that is needed for the bill to be approved. However, bills seeking to amend the Constitution must be carried by a special majority: <b>not</b> <b>less</b> than two-thirds of all MPs on the second and third readings.|$|E

Cystidia are either absent, or present infrequently as incompletely differentiated cystidioles (sterile cells about the size of an immature basidium). In mass, the spores are white. Spores are broadly ellipsoid to roughly spherical, and echinulose (covered with small spines). They are also hyaline and inamyloid.|$|E
5|$|The {{institution}} of the Castellania {{was replaced by the}} Tribunale Provisorio and the Tribunale Civile di Prim'Instanza. The post of Castellano was abolished, and judges were nominated by the Commission de Gouvernement. During the years of French occupation, the building was known as the Palais de Justice. <b>Not</b> <b>less</b> than three full cases of silver secured at the Castellania, were taken by the French on November 8, 1798, and were melted to create coins to remunerate the Jacobins. It was {{one of a series of}} similar reasons that consequently triggered a Maltese revolt. The French law system did not last enough to influence the Maltese courts at the time.|$|E
5|$|The new coins {{tended to}} {{accumulate}} {{in the hands}} of merchants beyond the legal tender limit, but banks refused to accept them beyond the one-dollar maximum. Storeowners were forced to discount the coins to brokers. Postmasters, compelled by law to accept the coins, found that the Treasury would not accept them as deposits except in lots of $100, in accordance with the authorizing statute. In 1871, Congress alleviated the problem by passing legislation allowing the Treasury to redeem unlimited quantities of nickels and other low-denomination coins when presented in lots of <b>not</b> <b>less</b> than $20. It was not until 1933, long after the shield design passed from the scene, that the nickel was made legal tender without limit.|$|E

As it is the practice for MPs to be appointed as Chairmen of CDCs, these MPs have also been designated as Mayors.|$|E
5|$|When the Jesuits left Maribojoc in 1768, the Augustinian Recollects {{administered}} to the spiritual needs of the town until 1898. Father Julian de Santa Ana, from the Recollects, served as the second parish priest. In 1794 and 1880, the towns of Cortes and Antequera established their own parish, separate from Maribojoc. The first church was constructed in a muddy area of the town proper from 1798 and was finished after 18 years under forced labor (polos y servicios) in 1816. To build the church, parishioners were instructed to bring <b>not</b> <b>less</b> than 4 pounds of rock from the sea every time they attended.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} US Department of Labor’s (DOL) governmentwide {{implementation}} of the Davis-Bacon Act, federal regulations require that all laborers and mechanics who work for a contractor or subcontractor on federally financed construction contracts over $2,000 must be paid wages <b>not</b> <b>less</b> than those the DOL established for the project location (i.e., the prevailing wage). This Compliance Requirement was created to assure that recipients oblige contractors {{to comply with the}} Davis-Bacon Act, by including in their construction contracts with a contractor or subcontractor a clause or requirement to comply with the Davis-Bacon Act and the DOL regulations. The clause should also include a requirement for the contractor or subcontractor to submit to the recipient weekly (e.g., for each week in which any contract work is performed) a copy of the construction payroll accompanied by statement of compliance. This report is commonly referred to as “certified payrolls”, and is often done using Optional Form WH-347 (OMB No. 1215-0149), a standard form pre-designed by the OMB.|$|E
