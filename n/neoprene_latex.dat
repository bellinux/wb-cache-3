40|$|PURPOSE: The {{permeability}} of 13 different {{gloves to}} 13 cytotoxic agents under controlled dynamic conditions is described. METHODS: Thirteen cytotoxic agents were prepared {{at the highest}} concentrations normally encountered by pharmacy personnel. Four glove types [...] <b>neoprene,</b> natural rubber <b>latex,</b> nitrile, and vinyl [...] {{were exposed to the}} cytotoxic agents for 15, 30, and 60 minutes. Tests were conducted using the middle finger of each glove. Linearity, reproducibility, and sensitivity were evaluated for each drug tested. Assays were run using liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet light (HPLC-UV). Permeability testing was conducted using an original system designed to evaluate dynamic constraints, such as rubbing, stretching, and tension. RESULTS: Linearity by LC/MS/MS and HPLC-UV was confirmed at concentrations up to 1000 ng/mL for all drugs. Most glove materials were permeable at rates below ASTM recommendations over the one-hour testing period. Vinyl was the most permeable material. Carmustine permeated the widest variety of materials. Due to the high sensitivity of the analytic methods, all materials displayed low but significant permeability for at least one drug after one hour. Higher resistance to permeation was recorded for all neoprene, some natural rubber latex, and one nitrile glove. CONCLUSION: <b>Neoprene,</b> natural rubber <b>latex,</b> and nitrile gloves displayed the highest resistance to permeation of the 13 cytotoxic agents studied.

40|$|Intraluminal {{injections}} of <b>neoprene</b> or <b>latex</b> {{have been used}} for several years as a means of determining the exact site of fluid collection along the renal tubule during micropuncture experiments. After the tubules have been injected, it is the usual practice to excise a small wedge of tissue surrounding the injected tubule or nephron and then treat the tissue with concentrated hydrochloric acid to effect solidification of the latex column and maceration of the surrounding tissue. The latex “cast” is then dissected free of the macerated tissue and appropriate measurements are taken from the anatomic point of reference (glomerulus for proximal tubule, macula densa for distal tubule) to the site of puncture. The location of the puncture site can then be expressed in terms of its relative distance {{from the beginning of the}} proximal or distal convoluted tubule. However, since the epithelium of the injected tubule undergoes maceration in the hydrochloric acid, direct and parallel histological observations at the site of puncture have not been possible as a rule. The present report describes the use of intraluminal latex injections to aid in the histological identification and characterization of the epithelium at the exact site of micropuncture. The technique can also be used to aid in the positive identification of the epithelium within other segments of the same tubule that are more distant from the site of puncture. Use of this technique permits the simultaneous evaluation of function and structure under identical physiological conditions via an analysis of the composition of tubule fluid and an examination of cellular structure with light and electron microscopy...|$|R

40|$|O Saimiri sciureus é um primata não humano existente na região amazônica e não consta na lista de animais em perigo de extinção, de acordo com o IBAMA. Neste trabalho, sistematizou-se os ramos colaterais viscerais da aorta {{abdominal}} de seis animais sendo três machos e três fêmeas, os quais tiveram o sistema circulatório preenchido com <b>látex</b> <b>Neoprene,</b> adicionado de contraste radiográfico. O resultado observado foi que a aorta abdominal emitiu ventralmente, como ramo colateral visceral, a artéria celíaca, que se trifurcou nas artérias gástrica esquerda, hepática e lienal. Os ramos da artéria celíaca promovem a irrigação do estômago, duodeno, fígado, pâncreas e baço. A seguir, a aorta abdominal emitiu a artéria mesentérica cranial, de calibre maior que a artéria celíaca e justaposta caudalmente. A artéria mesentérica cranial emitiu ramos que vascularizaram a parte final do duodeno, pâncreas, jejuno, íleo, ceco, cólon maior e cólon menor. A aorta abdominal emitiu lateralmente as artérias renais direita e esquerda. A artéria adrenal esquerda surgiu como um ramo colateral direto da artéria celíaca e a artéria adrenal direita surgiu da artéria renal direita. A artéria mesentérica caudal foi emitida da superfície ventral da aorta abdominal, logo abaixo das artérias renais. Em L 6, a aorta abdominal se bifurcou, dando origem às artérias ilíacas externas direita e esquerda e estas deram origem à artéria ilíaca interna e femoral direita e esquerda. As artérias testiculares ou ováricas tiveram origem na artéria ilíaca interna. A continuidade da aorta abdominal deu origem à artéria sacral mediana e a continuidade desta é chamada de artéria caudal mediana. O estudo da espécie em questão é de suma importância para gerar conhecimentos a respeito dos primatas não humanos existentes em nosso país. Dessa forma, pode-se dizer que o Saimiri sciureus é um importante modelo biológico para o desenvolvimento de pesquisas biomédicas. The Saimiri sciureus is a non human primate {{that exists}} in the amazon region, which is not in the list of endangered animals according to IBAMA. So, this research systemized the collateral branches visceral of the abdominal aorta of these animals. It was used six animals, three males and three females, which had the circulatory system filled with <b>latex</b> <b>Neoprene</b> added of radiographic contrast. The results showed that the abdominal aorta ventrally emitted a collateral visceral branch called celiac artery, which originates three branches: left gastric, hepatic and lienal arteries. The branches of the celiac artery promoted the irrigation of the stomach, duodenum, liver, pancreas and spleen. Then the abdominal aorta emitted the cranial mesenteric artery, which was of a larger size than the celiac artery and was caudally juxtaposed. The cranial mesenteric artery supply branches that irrigate the final portion of the duodenum, pancreas, jejunum, ileum, cecum and colon. Abdominal aorta emitted laterally the right and left kidney arteries. The left adrenal artery as a collateral branch of the celiac artery and the right adrenal artery has been originated in the right renal artery. The mesenteric caudal artery was emitted from the ventral surface of the abdominal aorta, below the kidney arteries. In L 6, abdominal aorta has two derivations to origin the right and left external iliac arteries and these had given origin to the internal iliac and femoral artery right and left. The testicular or ovary arteries were emitted in internal iliac arteries. Of the abdominal aorta led to origin the sacral median artery and in this sequence there is the caudal median artery. The study of this specie is very important to generate knowledge about non human primates existing in our country.

Ramificaram-se em ramos glandulares suprindo as glândulas mandibulares, parótidas, porção monostomática das glândulas sublinguais e lobo {{cervical}} do timo; em ramos musculares irrigando os músculos pterigóideo medial, masseter, face ventral do músculo digástrico e cutâneo da face. Ainda, o ramo faríngico nutrindo o palato mole, a bula timpânica e o basihióide, e por último a artéria submentoniana que direcionou-se para os músculos milohióideo e a face dorsal do músculo digástrico. Origins, ramifications and {{distributions of}} {{the left and right}} facial arteries were studied in the 30 (thirdy) stillborn swines (Sus scrofa domesticus) of the Sadia lineage, 17 (seventeen) males and 13 (thirteen) females. The specimen had it s artery system filled with stained solution of <b>neoprene</b> <b>latex</b> 601 A and after wards attached in a wattery solution of formaldehyde at 10 %. It was observed that in 100 % of the animals studied the facial arteries originated of the ventrolateral surface of the external carotid artery rostrally to the lingual artery. The gland branches ramificated supplying the mandibular, parotid glands, monostomatica portion of the sublingual gland and lobos of the cervical thymus in muscular branches irrigating the medial pterygoid muscle, masseter, ventral aspect of the digastric muscle and cutaneous of the face. Furthemore, the pharyngitis branch irrigating the soft palate, the tympanic bula and basihyoid, and last but not least the submentalis artery that is directed towards the submental muscles and the dorsal face of the digastric muscle...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out on the origin, number and {{disposition}} of the arterial vessels and their branches which irrigated the cloacal bursas of 30 hens (Gallus gallus) of the Hybro PG lineage. First of all, the left isquiadic artery from the samples was cannulated and injected with a 50 % colored solution of <b>Neoprene</b> <b>latex</b> “ 450 ”; then, we continued the experiment with dissection whose results confi rmed that the cloacal bursa was supplied by direct branches from {{the left and right}} internal pudendal arteries and bursocloacal arteries in 100 % of the cases, varying only in terms of the numbers and disposition of their branches. There were also some branches from the median caudal artery (23 %) and left external pudendal (3. 33 %). The total number of branches varied from 1 to 4 and their distribution was unique in each sample...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Many {{applications}} {{have been}} developed {{by taking advantage of}} the combined properties of rubber and textiles. For example, the shear behavior of rubber-coated fabrics is governed by the interaction of its two components, which is dependent on the yarn mobility. In this paper, the effect of coating penetration and thickness on the shear behavior is studied, along with the development of a combined lubrication theory and flow through a porous media model for coating penetration. For the shear deformation of the fabrics, nine types of woven PET fabrics are made and dip-coated multiple times in <b>neoprene</b> <b>latex,</b> with and without a coagulant agent. The results show that with the increase of coating thickness and penetration, the shear behavior becomes more similar to cord/textile embedded in rubber. The results from the modeling section suggest that a model can be developed to link the process and the material parameters to the ensuing coated fabric structure and its mechanical response...|$|E
40|$|El {{principal}} elemento arterial del pie es el arco plantar profundo (APP), del cual se originan entre otras, las aa. metatarsianas plantares (AMP), responsables por la irrigación de parte de la región plantar profunda y de los dedos. Con el objetivo de aportar detalles anatómicos y biométricos a la cirugía e imagenología del pie, estudiamos el número de AMP, origen, trayecto y calibre de las mismas. El estudio fue realizado en 50 pies de 25 cadáveres de individuos adultos, brasileños, de ambos sexos. Las arterias fueron inyectadas con <b>látex</b> <b>neoprene</b> (Artifix L 14) teñido de rojo, para luego disecar la región plantar por planos. Observamos 3 AMP en 5 casos (10 %), de las cuales, 2 no tenían la 2 ª AMP (4 % del total) y 3 la 4 ª AMP (6 %). La presencia de 4 AMP fue encontrada en 43 pies (86 %) y sólo en 2 (4 %) se encontraron 5 AMP. Las 1 ª y 2 ª AMP se originaron del APP o de la arteria dorsal del pie, mientras que las 3 ª y 4 ª AMP siempre provinieron del APP. Cuando las arterias fueron otorgadas por el APP, en 6 % de los casos las 1 ª y 2 ª AMP se originaron de un tronco común, situación que también ocurrió con las 2 ª y 3 ª AMP (10 %) y con las 3 ª y 4 ª AMP (8 %). La 1 ª AMP transcurrió por el primer espacio interóseo en 92 % de los casos y las 2 ª, 3 ª y 4 ª AMP lo hicieron por el espacio correspondiente en 100 %. El calibre promedio de la 1 ª AMP fue de 1, 73 mm, el de la 2 ª de 1, 43 mm, el de la 3 ª de 1, 54 mm y el de la 4 ª de 1, 52 mm. La 1 ª AMP fue más calibrosa que la 2 ª AMP en ambos lados. Estas cuatro arterias alcanzan las comisuras interdigitales y son fundamentales para la irrigación de los dedos del pie The {{principal arterial}} {{formation of the}} foot is the deep plantar arch (DPA) which give off the plantar metatarsal arteries (PMA), responsibles by the blood supply of part of the plantar deep region and the fingers. With the purpose to give anatomical and biometric details to the surgery and images techniques of the foot, the number, origin, course and calibers of the PMA were studied. We injected <b>latex</b> <b>neoprene</b> (Artifix L 14) in 50 feet of 25 adult cadavers of both sexs and brasilian origin. Then, we dissected the plantar region and we found 3 PMA in 5 cases (10 %), in two of these cases the 2 nd PMA was absent (4 % of total cases) and in 3 the 4 th PMA no was present (6 %). We observed 4 PMA in 43 cases (86 %) and in only 2 cases (4 %) we found 5 PMA. The first and second PMA originated from DPA or from the dorsal artery of the foot and the 3 rd and 4 th PMA always originated from DPA. When the arteries originated from the DPA, in 6 % of the cases {{the first and second}} PMA originated from the common trunk, similar disposition ocurred with the 2 nd and 3 rd (10 %) and with the 3 rd and 4 th PMA (8 %). The first PMA coursed by the first interosseous space in 92 % of the cases and the 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th PMA coursed by the corresponding space in 100 %. The averages calibers of the PMA were the followings: first PMA= 1. 73 mm; 2 nd PMA= 1. 43 mm; 3 rd PMA= 1. 54 mm and 4 th PMA= 1. 52 mm. The caliber of the first PMA was greater of the 2 nd PMA in both sides. The PMA reach the interdigital commissures and are of fundamental importance for the blood supply of the foot finger...|$|R
40|$|Se estudió la ramificación de las arterias umbilicales en la {{placenta}} de 35 caprinos, adultos originarios del Estado de Piauí, Brasil. Las arterias fueron inyectadas con <b>látex</b> <b>Neoprene</b> " 650 " y corroídas después de haber inyectado acetato de vinilo. En 17 casos de gestación única, la arteria dirigida al cuerno uterino gestante, presentó una media de 12 ramas colaterales y 2 terminales. La arteria del cuerno uterino no gestante mostró, en promedio, 19 ramas colaterales y 2 terminales. En 13 observaciones de gestación gemelar, la arteria del cuerno uterino derecho, dirigida al cuerpo del útero, dio origen en promedio, a 8 ramos colaterales y 2 terminales. La arteria del cuerno uterino derecho dirigida a su extremidad tuvo un promedio de 11 ramos colaterales y 2 terminales. La arteria del cuerno uterino izquierdo dirigida al cuerpo del útero, otorgó en promedio 9 ramos colaterales y 2 terminales. La arteria del cuerno uterino izquierdo dirigida a su extremidad, emitió una media de 10 ramas colaterales y 2 terminales. A nivel de cotiledones, las arterias adoptaron un trayecto marginal, formando una verdadera "vuelta" vascular, de la que partían ramas menores y perpendiculares a ella, formando múltiples arborizaciones terminales para irrigar al cotiledón The three-dimensional {{analysis of}} the arterial ramification of the umbilical cord was studied in placenta of 35 mixed breed adult goats (originated from the State of Piauí, Brazil), after intravascular injection of Neoprene 630 and vinyl acetate followed by corrosion. Plastic casts of the vascular network {{made it possible to}} verify that in 17 single gastations the artery reaches the pregnant uterine horn gives rise to 12 colateral branches and 2 terminal ones. The artery of the non pregnant uterine horn showed, an average of 19 colateral and 2 terminal branches. In 13 samples of gemelar gestations, the artery of the right uterine horn directed to the uterus body had 8 colateral and 2 terminal branches average. The artery of the right uterine horn directed to the horn's extremity, had an average of 11 colateral and 2 terminal branches. The artery of the left uterine horn directed to the uterus body, had 9 colateral and 2 terminal branches on average. The artery of the left uterine horn directed to the horn's extremity, originated a mean of 10 colateral and 2 terminal branches. At the cotyledons level, the arteries adopted a marginal course forming a true vascular "loop" from which smaller and more perpendicular branches arise, which by their turn give rise to multiple terminal arborizations irrigating the cotyledo...|$|R
