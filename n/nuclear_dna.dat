40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB in the carrageenin-induced rat pleurisy. We found that <b>nuclear</b> factor-kappaB <b>DNA</b> binding activity, measured in inflammatory cells which migrated into the pleural cavity, was detectable at 3 and 6 h, markedly increased at 24 h and decreased at 48 h after induction of the inflammation. The increase in <b>nuclear</b> factor-kappaB <b>DNA</b> binding activity paralleled both exudate formation and leukocyte infiltration. Treatment of animals with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, an inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB activation, inhibited the <b>nuclear</b> factor-kappaB <b>DNA</b> binding activity as well as exudate formation and leukocyte infiltration. These results indicate that nuclear factor-kappaB is activated in the carrageenin-induced pleurisy and suggest that its inhibition may represent a novel strategy for the modulation of inflammatory response...|$|R

5|$|However, {{mitochondrial}} DNA reflects {{only the}} history of the females in a population and so may not represent {{the history of}} the population as a whole. This can be partially overcome by the use of paternal genetic sequences, such as the non-recombining region of the Y-chromosome. In a broader sense, only studies that also include <b>nuclear</b> <b>DNA</b> can provide a comprehensive evolutionary history of a population.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>nuclear</b> <b>DNA</b> {{sequence}} comparisons {{reported in}} 2017 suggest that Tapanuli orangutans diverged from Sumatran orangutans about 3.4 million years ago. Tapanuli orangutans diverged from Bornean orangutans, much later, about 670,000 years ago. Orangutans travelled from Sumatra to Borneo as the islands were connected by land bridges {{as parts of}} Sundaland during recent glacial periods when sea levels were much lower.

5|$|The Danube {{crested newt}} was {{described}} as a variety of the northern crested newt (Triturus cristatus) by C. Kiritzescu in 1903. Later, it was considered a subspecies until genetic analysis supported its recognition as a separate species in the crested newt species complex. The northern crested newt is its likely sister species according to a molecular phylogenetic study based on mitochondrial DNA; analysis of <b>nuclear</b> <b>DNA</b> gives however some conflicting results regarding this sister relationship.|$|E
40|$|Plastids and {{mitochondria}} {{derive from}} prokaryotic symbionts that {{lost most of}} their genes after the establishment of endosymbiosis. In consequence, relatively few {{of the thousands of}} different proteins in these organelles are actually encoded there. Most are now specified by nuclear genes. The most direct way to reconstruct the evolutionary history of plastids and mitochondria is to sequence and analyze their relatively small genomes. However, understanding the functional diversification of these organelles requires the identification of their complete protein repertoires – which is the ultimate goal of organellar proteomics. In the meantime, judicious combination of proteomics-based data with analyses of nuclear genes that include interspecies comparisons and/or predictions of subcellular location is the method of choice. Such genome-wide approaches can now make use of the entire sequences of plant nuclear genomes that have emerged since 2000. Here I review the results of these attempts to reconstruct the evolution and functions of plant DNA-containing organelles, focusing in particular on data from nuclear genomes. In addition, I discuss proteomic approaches to the direct identification of organellar proteins and briefly refer to ongoing research on non-coding <b>nuclear</b> <b>DNAs</b> of organellar origin (specifically, <b>nuclear</b> mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> and <b>nuclear</b> plastid <b>DNA)</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Constantine Samuel Rafinesque briefly {{described}} the blackmouth catshark in his 1810 Caratteri di alcuni nuovi generi e nuove specie di animali e piante della Sicilia: con varie osservazioni sopra i medesimi, wherein he referenced the distinctive black interior of its mouth (from which the specific epithet melastomus is derived). No type specimen was designated. This species {{may also be}} called the black-mouthed dogfish. A 2005 phylogenetic analysis that included five Galeus species, based on mitochondrial and <b>nuclear</b> <b>DNA,</b> found that G.melastomus forms a clade with G.murinus, apart from the clade of G.eastmani, G.gracilis, and G.sauteri.

Furthermore, the individuals sequenced in the study sorted into two genetically distinct clades, suggesting that N. annotata is a cryptic species complex. The two putative species were estimated to have diverged ~4.9 Ma; the precipitating event was likely the splitting of the ancestral population by coastline changes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Timothy E. Breen Ph. D. A DATABASE FOR <b>NUCLEAR</b> RECEPTOR <b>DNA</b> BINDING SITES A {{database}} {{has been}} developed for <b>nuclear</b> receptor <b>DNA</b> binding sites and the corresponding <b>nuclear</b> receptor <b>DNA</b> binding domain (DBD) amino acid sequences. This database contains three main tables <b>nuclear</b> receptor <b>DNA</b> footprints, <b>nuclear</b> receptor <b>DNA</b> binding sites and the corresponding nuclear receptor DBD. The ultimate goal of this database {{is to provide a}} repository for all experimentally derived <b>nuclear</b> receptor <b>DNA</b> binding sites. Finite DNA binding sites and footprints are obtained from original peer reviewed research that used selected experimental methods to identify <b>nuclear</b> receptor <b>DNA</b> binding sites. Acceptable methods for the identification of DNA binding sites and/or footprints include reporter genes and DNA deletion analysis, DNAase I footprinting, exonuclease III footprinting, methylation protection, methylation interference, nuclear receptor protein mutagenesis and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. With respect to this database, a nuclear receptor footprint is a DNA sequence less than 50 nucleotides in length identified by one of the methods listed above. A binding site is a DNA sequence identified within one of the footprints that is less than 15 nucleotides in length and corresponds to a previously identified half site, response element or consensus sequence. The five prime and three prime location of each footprint with respect to the transcription initiation site is noted in the database. The corresponding nuclear receptor DBD amino acid sequence is obtained from the Swiss-Prot database. The nuclear receptor data is annotated with the literature reference, DNA source, DNA binding site identification method, the nuclear receptor Swiss-Prot primary accession number, and inter halfsite spacing if specified. The tables are related by the literature reference, DNA source, experimental method and nuclear receptor ID. Sixty one publications have been identified from 1983 through 1994 that contain nuclear receptor binding sequences identified with one of the methods listed above. These publications were identified by selected review articles, cited references, citation index and PubMed searches. Currently, the database contains 21 DNA binding sites and 30 DNA footprints from 14 publications between 1983 and 1987. As the database expands, the literature citations will be used to design new search strategies for the nuclear receptor literature. After the current literature has been surveyed and the database is up to date, submissions will be accepted from past and future research. This database will eventually become publicly accessible. In order to interpret the experimentally derived DNA footprints, the specific DNA base - NR protein interactions are summarized from six X ray crystallographic studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of preferential transmission (i. e., maternal inheritance) of cytoplasmic genes was investigated with chloroplast DNA of Chlamydomonas {{as a model}} system. The behavior of <b>nuclear</b> and chloroplast <b>DNAs</b> were compared in the sexual cycle; DNAs from male and female parents were distinguished by labeling with 14 N- or 15 NH 4 Cl and then by making the crosses: 14 N (female) × 15 N (male) and the reciprocal. Chloroplast DNAs from the two parents followed different paths in the zygote, but <b>nuclear</b> <b>DNAs</b> showed no differences. Chloroplast DNA from the female parent persists in the zygote, but undergoes a density shift of 0. 003 - 0. 005 g/cm 3 to a lighter buoyant density, whereas that from the male disappears soon after zygote formation. The possibility is discussed that a modification-restriction system may be involved...|$|R

5|$|Molecular phylogenetic data helped clarify {{relationships}} within the genus Triturus. A 2011 phylogeny based on complete mitochondrial DNA resolved all divergences with high statistical support. The crested and the marbled newts are sister groups, {{and within the}} crested newts, the Balkan–Asian group with T. anatolicus, T. karelinii and T. ivanbureschi is sister to the remaining species, results consistent with other studies. The mitochondrial analysis also supports the northern (T. cristatus) and the Danube crested newt (T. dobrogicus), {{as well as the}} Italian (T. carnifex) and the Macedonian crested newt (T. macedonicus), respectively, as sister species, but analysis of <b>nuclear</b> <b>DNA</b> gave some conflicting results regarding those divergences.|$|E
5|$|Morphological {{studies have}} been {{inconclusive}} about the evolutionary relationships of the tasselled wobbegong, but overall have gauged it {{to be among the}} more derived wobbegong (Orectolobidae) species. A 2009 phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial and <b>nuclear</b> <b>DNA</b> found otherwise, that this species was in fact basal to all other wobbegongs except the northern wobbegong (O. wardi). This result supports the synonymization of Eucrossorhinus with Orectolobus. Molecular clock estimation placed the speciation of the tasselled wobbegong at 11–6 Ma, coinciding with a period of significant geological rearrangement and the formation of coral reef habitats in the region.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} {{similarly}} coloured but smaller king penguin (A. patagonicus), the emperor penguin {{is one of}} two extant species in the genus Aptenodytes. Fossil evidence of a third species—Ridgen's penguin (A. ridgeni)—has been found in fossil records from the late Pliocene, about three million years ago, in New Zealand. Studies of penguin behaviour and genetics have proposed that the genus Aptenodytes is basal; in other words, that it split off from a branch which led to all other living penguin species. Mitochondrial and <b>nuclear</b> <b>DNA</b> evidence suggests this split occurred around 40million years ago.|$|E
50|$|Ionta et al. (2007) reconstructed {{phylogeny}} of Rhexia species {{based on}} molecular data (<b>nuclear</b> ribosomal <b>DNA</b> and chloroplast DNA sequence) and morphological data.

Remaining species showed incongruence between <b>nuclear</b> ribosomal <b>DNA</b> tree and chloroplast DNA tree (R. lutea, R. nashii, R. salicifolia) and/or multiple alleles of ncpGS (R. cubensis, R. lutea, R. nashii, R. parviflora, and R. salicifolia) implying putative hybrid origin of these species.|$|R

5|$|After Whitley's initial description, C. tilstoni was {{generally}} regarded as synonymous with C. limbatus, the common blacktip shark. In the 1980s, additional morphological and life history data again favored the recognition of C. tilstoni as a separate species, which was eventually confirmed by allozyme studies performed by Shane Lavery and James Shaklee. Several molecular phylogenetic studies based on allozymes, mitochondrial DNA, and <b>nuclear</b> <b>DNA</b> {{have found that the}} Australian and common blacktip sharks form a closely related clade with the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides) and the smoothtooth blacktip shark (C. leiodon).

5|$|The Australian raven's closest {{relatives}} {{are the other}} two species of raven occurring in Australia: the little raven and forest raven. The Australian raven is also somewhat {{closely related to the}} Torresian and little crow, although not as closely related as it is to the other raven species. Initial single gene genetic analysis of the genus using mitochondrial DNA showed the three raven species to belong to one lineage and the two crows to another. The genetic separation between species is small and there was a suggestion the little raven may be nested within the Australian raven, though the authors conceded more genetic work was needed. Subsequent multigene analysis using <b>nuclear</b> <b>DNA</b> by Jønsson and colleagues in 2012 showed the eastern and western subspecies of the Australian raven to form two clades, almost as genetically distinct as the forest and little raven are to each other. This led the authors to propose that the subspecies be recognised as separate species.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} view of hammerhead shark {{evolution is}} that species with smaller cephalofoils evolved first from a requiem shark ancestor, and later {{gave rise to}} species with larger cephalofoils. Under this interpretation, the winghead shark is the most derived hammerhead, as it has the most extreme cephalofoil morphology. However, molecular phylogenetic research based on isozymes, mitochondrial DNA, and <b>nuclear</b> <b>DNA</b> have found the opposite pattern, with the winghead shark as the most basal member of the hammerhead family. This result supports the counterintuitive idea that the first hammerhead shark to evolve had a large cephalofoil. It also supports the separation of Eusphyra from Sphyrna by keeping the latter monophyletic (including all descendants of a single ancestor). The winghead shark lineage is estimated to have diverged {{from the rest of}} the hammerheads some 15–20 million years ago during the Miocene.|$|E
