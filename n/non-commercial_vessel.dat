40|$|Interactions {{between humans}} and dusky {{dolphins}} in the coastal waters of New Zealand are increasing. My research focused on tourism interactions, with Kaikoura as the study site; and, on habitat use in an active aquaculture area, with Admiralty Bay as the study site. In Kaikoura, companies engaged in commercial cetacean tourism (For Hire Company) have permits issued by the New Zealand?s Department of Conservation, allowing them to take paying customers out to view and swim with wild dusky dolphins. During summer and fall of 2005, I assessed {{the effectiveness of a}} voluntary ?rest period? established to give time free of humans to the dolphins. I used a theodolite to track the movements of large groups of dusky dolphins and recorded the arrival, departure and behaviors of all vessels approaching within 400 m of the group. The ?rest period? resulted in a reduction of vessel visits compared to non-rest periods, yet one For Hire Company and private recreational vessels continued to visit dusky dolphin groups during this time. To increase compliance with the voluntary regulation, more education is needed targeting private recreational vessels. Weekend traffic was higher compared to weekday traffic, during both rest and non-rest periods; a large increase occurred in weekend <b>non-commercial</b> <b>vessel</b> traffic. Swimming with calves is prohibited by New Zealand?s Marine Mammal Protection Regulations of 1992, yet 71. 4 percent of the swim attempts I observed on-board For Hire Company tours were conducted with groups containing calves. More should be done {{to reduce the number of}} swims conducted with groups of dusky dolphins containing calves. In winter of 2005, I used hourly theodolite scans to record the number of dusky dolphin groups using Admiralty Bay, a different near-shore environment with less tourism than off Kaikoura, and with near-shore mussel farms. Groups of dusky dolphins were observed in Admiralty Bay using the full extent of the bay. This re-enforces previous findings that Admiralty Bay is an important winter foraging ground for dusky dolphins, and further aquaculture development in the bay would remove available foraging habitat...|$|E
25|$|West Channel – Extends {{from the}} area of the rip, heads towards the north-west and ends off the coast of St Leonards. The depth varies, in May 1998 there was a minimum of 4.1 metres. <b>Non-{{commercial}}</b> <b>vessels</b> are still navigated through the channel, however it is no longer used for commercial shipping.|$|R

However, an Admiralty Warrant was issued on 5 December 1938, authorising these vessels to fly the Australian Red Ensign.

40|$|We {{statistically}} {{estimate the}} relationship between lock usage (the number of barges locked) and lock congestion (the average delay and process time incurred) using a fixed-effects regression model that accounts for both lock characteristics and lock heterogeneity. In addition, we exploit the geographical variation in demand patterns for individual locks along the Upper Mississippi River system of locks and dams to avoid simultaneity bias that arises {{from the use of}} observed data. Using a panel dataset spanning the years 1993 - 2010, we find statistically significant evidence of the existence of a quadratic lock congestion function for 600 ft lock technology. While 1, 200 ft lock technology on the other hand seemingly operates under free-flow conditions, the presence of an auxiliary chamber significantly mitigates congestion, with the effect being more pronounced for higher levels of traffic. Unscheduled lock outages attenuate lock congestion for both types of lock technology, while lock age (following a U-shaped relationship) affects congestion costs for 600 ft locks only. In addition, we find a tempering effect of scheduled outages in the case of 600 ft locks, and <b>non-commercial</b> <b>vessels</b> in the case of 1, 200 ft locks. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|It is {{recognized}} transatlantically that the United States will not single-handedly shape a New World Order as some speculated {{at the turn}} of this century. Instead, a neo-regionalism appears to be developing {{in many parts of the}} world, including the Euro-Mediterranean, with aspiring potential regional hegemons, such as Turkey, Iran, possibly Syria, as well as an enhanced presence in the Mediterranean of Russian and Chinese <b>non-commercial</b> <b>vessels.</b> This rapidly changing greater Euro-Mediterranean region has the potential for a more democratic paradigm in which to approach new and old security threats of neighboring countries – and yet perhaps a fear of an all-too powerful America being replaced by a fear of its imminent weakening (British Council 2008). The role of the expected continued presence of the U. S. in the (greater) Mediterranean and Middle East, through NATO, the Mediterranean Dialogue, the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative, as well as a number of (ad hoc) peacekeeping missions (such as in and off the coast of Somalia) are analyzed from its bilateral as well multilateral structural embeddedness in the Euro-Mediterranean region. Especially the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) 1 would fit Van Langenhove‟s (2007) concept of a (hypothetical) “Third Regionalism”, whereby the institutional environment for dealing with "out of area" consequences of regional policies would become fully consolidated, regions become more proactive in engaging with inter-regional arrangements and agreements, going beyond purely trade issues with a multidimensional character, and having the potential to affect more relations at the global level. The UfM‟s potential in contributing to regional security and stability (i. a. as nested in the EU‟s permanent delegation to the UN beyond its goal in terms of political, economic and social-cultural development), has the potential to consolidate competing preferences intra-regionally, while building on the shared history and cultural and institutional structures existing today in the Euro-Mediterranean “region”. This chapter will extrapolate the security implications of this region in terms of the revision, which previous research suggested (e. g. Boening 2008; 2009), to a Euro-Mediterranean Regional Security Complex (in light of the complexity of the internal securitization processes and the degree of security interdependence in the region) from the Middle Eastern Regional Security Complex, which Buzan and Waever‟s (2003) had proposed...|$|R
