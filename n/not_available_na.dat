40|$|The {{present study}} {{has been carried out}} to {{evaluate}} the current status of clinical, educational, social, ethical, and resource issues related to the care of the elderly among emergency physicians (EPs) and emergency nurses (ENs) in Italy. A questionnaire was designed by our scientific society, the Academy of Emergency Medicine and Care (AcEMC), and disseminated directly or by e-mail to a large number of EPs and ENs in several Emergency Departments (EDs) throughout Italy, as well as in a Swiss center. Of the questionnaires, 524 were filled out and returned. Responders were in the majority females [273 vs 239; 12 <b>not</b> <b>available</b> (<b>NA)</b> ], and nurses [259 vs 207 physicians vs 54 auxiliary; 4 NA]. Responses to five questions appeared to be normally distributed, whereas other questions elicited interesting responses. In this study focusing {{for the first time on}} the EPs’ and ENs’ perception of a broad spectrum of issues related to the elderly emergency care, the Italian community of EPs and ENs seems to be rather comfortable with geriatric emergency medicine, but largely unsatisfied with healthcare out-of-hospital services. The lack of elderly-specific diagnostic and therapeutic post-discharge pathways is broadly appreciated, and the concept of medical futility is not explicitly included in the vast majority of Italian hospital protocols...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} whether virtual chromoendoscopy {{can improve the}} delineation of small bowel lesions previously detected by conventional white light small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE). METHODS: Retrospective single center study. One hundred lesions selected from forty-nine consecutive conventional white light SBCE (SBCE-WL) examinations were included. Lesions were reviewed at three Flexible Spectral Imaging Color Enhancement (FICE) settings and Blue Filter (BF) by two gastroenterologists with experience in SBCE, blinded to each other's findings, who ranked the quality of delineation as better, equivalent or worse than conventional SBCE-WL. Inter-observer percentage of agreement was determined and analyzed with Fleiss Kappa (κ) coefficient. Lesions selected for the study included angioectasias (n = 39), ulcers/erosions (n = 49) and villous edema/atrophy (n = 12). RESULTS: Overall, the delineation of lesions was improved in 77 % of cases with FICE 1, 74 % with FICE 2, 41 % with FICE 3 and 39 % with the BF, with a percentage of agreement between investigators of 89 % (κ = 0. 833), 85 % (κ = 0. 764), 66 % (κ = 0. 486) and 79 % (κ = 0. 593), respectively. FICE 1 improved the delineation of 97. 4 % of angioectasias, 63. 3 % of ulcers/erosions and 66. 7 % of villous edema/atrophy with a percentage of agreement of 97. 4 % (κ = 0. 910), 81. 6 % (κ = 0. 714) and 91. 7 % (κ = 0. 815), respectively. FICE 2 improved the delineation of 97. 4 % of angioectasias, 57. 1 % of ulcers/erosions and 66. 7 % of villous edema/atrophy, with a percentage of agreement of 89. 7 % (κ = 0. 802), 79, 6 % (κ = 0. 703) and 91. 7 % (κ = 0. 815), respectively. FICE 3 improved the delineation of 46. 2 % of angioectasias, 24. 5 % of ulcers/erosions {{and none of the}} cases of villous edema/atrophy, with a percentage of agreement of 53. 8 % [κ = <b>not</b> <b>available</b> (<b>NA)</b> ], 75. 5 % (κ = NA) and 66. 7 % (κ = 0. 304), respectively. The BF improved the delineation of 15. 4 % of angioectasias, 61. 2 % of ulcers/erosions and 25 % of villous edema/atrophy, with a percentage of agreement of 76. 9 % (κ = 0. 558), 81. 6 % (κ = 0. 570) and 25. 0 % (κ = NA), respectively. CONCLUSION: Virtual chromoendoscopy can improve the delineation of angioectasias, ulcers/erosions and villous edema/atrophy detected by SBCE, with almost perfect interobserver agreement for FICE 1...|$|E

The collection contains five data sets. 1) soil bulk density (0 - 5 centimetre) and saturated water content. 2) Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity measured in the field at tensions of - 2 and - 6 centimetre using a mini disk infiltrometer. 3) Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity measured using a HYPROP (registered trademark) instrument, an instrument which determines the hydraulic properties of soil samples, on soil cores taken from the field plots. 4) Soil water release curves for wet soil corresponding to the hydraulic conductivity measurements made using a HYPROP in the laboratory on cores from the field. 5) Soil water release curve data for dry soil measured using a WP 4 potentiometer.

40|$|The retina adapts to the {{temporal}} contrast {{of the light}} inputs. One component of contrast adaptation is intrinsic to retinal ganglion cells: temporal contrast affects the variance of the synaptic inputs to ganglion cells, which alters the gain of spike generation. Here we show that slow Na inactivation is sufficient to produce the observed variance adaptation. Slow inactivation caused the <b>Na</b> current <b>available</b> for spike generation {{to depend on the}} past history of activity, both action potentials and subthreshold voltage variations. Recovery from slow inactivation required several hundred milliseconds. Increased current variance caused the threshold for spike generation to increase, presumably because of the decrease in <b>available</b> <b>Na</b> current. Simulations indicated that slow Na inactivation could account for the observed decrease in excitability. This suggests a simple picture of how ganglion cells contribute to contrast adaptation: (1) increasing contrast causes an increase in input current variance that raises the spike rate, and (2) the increased spike rate reduces the <b>available</b> <b>Na</b> current through slow inactivation, which feeds back to reduce excitability. Cells throughout the nervous system face similar problems of accommodating a large range of input signals; furthermore, the Na currents of many cells exhibit slow inactivation. Thus, adaptation mediated by feedback modulation of the Na current through slow inactivation could serve as a general mechanism to control excitabil-ity in spiking neurons.
