40|$|The {{emissions}} {{produced by}} gas turbine engines driven by catalytic com-bustion can contain signi 5 cantly {{lower levels of}} noxious gases than those exhausted from conventional flame $red engines. The research reported here has demonstrated that eficient power generation, combined with minimum <b>noxious</b> <b>emission,</b> {{can be achieved by}} utilising metal supported platinum catalyst combustion systems specijcally designed to ensure maximum compatibility with the engine models they are to power. A number of important applications for these systems are suggested. Catalytic combustion, that is flameless combustion promoted by a catalyst, can take place with a variety of fuels ranging from high octane aviation spirit or propane gas to low BTU waste gases or residue oils. Applications for this type of combustion have been sought, and studied, at Johnson Matthey’s labora-tories for more than a decade. These studies have included flameless heaters, which are used for a variety of agricultural, industrial and recreational purposes (I), and particu-larly Honeycat 03 systems for the combustion of organic fumes which would otherwise cause atmospheric pollution (2).

A total of 120 [(Landrace × Yorkshire) × Duroc] pigs with an average initial body weight (BW) of 54. 21 ± 2. 62 kg were used in this experiment. Pigs were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 dietary treatments on the basis of BW and sex (10 replicate pens per treatment with four pigs per pen: two gilts and two barrows in each pen). The experiment was divided into two phases: 0 - 5 weeks and 6 - 10 weeks. Dietary treatments were as follows: control, basal diet; control + 2. 5 % cane molasses; and control + 5 % cane molasses.

A total of 96 pigs with an average initial body weight (BW) of 80. 70 ± 2. 29 kg were assigned {{on the basis of}} weight to four treatment groups (6 replicates per treatment and 4 pigs per pen). In this study, dietary L. reuteri led to a higher ATTD of N than the negative groups (P< 0. 05). Pigs fed with soybean hull supplemental diet decreased (P< 0. 05) the fecal NH 3, H 2 S and acetic acid emission compared with those without supplementation.

The {{purpose of this}} section is to explore through numerical simulations a variety of the duct’s geometrical shapes, under which the <b>noxious</b> gases’ <b>emissions</b> {{at the end of}} the pipe could be reduced as much as possible. In fact, while the main chemical action which transforms the noxious gases into harmless products is due to the catalytic converters, the gas dynamics is also affected by the geometry (shape and volume) of the duct through which the gas flows. In particular, we first varied the duct’s profile without changing the device volume. All this only concerns the catalyzer’s geometry, since the mufflers do not affect the reduction of noxious gas.|$|R
50|$|In some countries, wood fire flues {{are often}} {{built into a}} heat {{preserving}} construction within which the flue gases circulate over heat retaining bricks before release to the atmosphere. The heat retaining bricks are covered in a decorative material such as brick, tiles or stone.

The heat from the flue gases is absorbed quickly by the bricks and then released slowly to the house rather than the chimney. In a well insulated home, a single load fire burning for {{one and a half}} hours twice a day is enough to keep an entire home warm for a 24-hour period. In this way, less fuel is used, and <b>noxious</b> <b>emissions</b> are reduced.

40|$|A {{measurements}} campaign {{carried out}} in the iron basin of Lorraine (North-east of France) put the spot on the existence of under-oxygenated and <b>noxious</b> gas <b>emissions</b> in vast built-up areas related to former mining works. In 1999, following the Lorraine local office of the French Ministry of Industry, Research and Environment (DRIRE) request, INERIS (the French National Institute for Safety and Risks) started some investigations to assess the geographical extend of the problem. These studies brought to the fore the existence of <b>noxious</b> gas <b>emissions</b> in relation with former mining workings that were not completely submerged. High level CO 2 content (up to 6 %) and low level O 2 content (down to 13 %) have been measured. At the same time, the Institute for Radio-protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) and the DAS S (a government organisation responsible to the national Ministry of Health) investigated and measured high level radon content (up to 15000 Bq/m 3) in the gaseous mixture. In some cases, these emissions affected directly inhabited buildings that were shown to have a link with the mine entrances or with the old superficial mining works. The consequences of a CO 2 enrichment and an O 2 impoverishment on health are numerous. The seriousness depends on the contents of these two gases: it ranges from headaches for CO 2 contents between 3 and 4 % and O 2 content between 14 and 16 %, to death for O 2 content lower than 6 % and CO 2 higher than 10 % (Monomakhoff, 1978). Fortunately, the content in inhabited buildings of the investigated areas didn't look directly risky. However, in some cases, the measured contents were very close to the critical level for which harmful effects can appear by O 2 deficit and CO 2 excess. Concerning the radon, it acts essentially on lung epithelium to further the development of cancer in case of long - lasting exposure with content higher than 500 - 1000 Bq/m 3 (Barrier and Lorentz, 2001). Apart from these clinical effects, the observed dysfunctioning of combustion appliances (boiler, gas cooker) due to CO 2 polluted and under - oxygenated air are likely to increase the explosion and CO emission risks in concerned houses. These observations induced INERIS to carry on its investigation, in order to better understand the mechanism of the gaseous emanations and to find reliable solutions to this problem...|$|R
