40|$|Ross River {{virus was}} grown in {{industrial}} facilities in vaccine-certified Vero {{cells in the}} absence of serum, inactivated using standard formalin-inactivation protocols, treated with Benzonase to digest host cell DNA and purified on a sucrose gradient. Mice given two subcutaneous injections of 0. 625 microg of this vaccine or two doses of 0. 156 microg vaccine with aluminium hydroxide adjuvant failed to develop a detectable viraemia after intravenous challenge with 10 (6) TCID 50 of the prototype strain of Ross River virus (T 48). Guinea pigs immunised with one or two 10 microg doses of vaccine with adjuvant also failed to develop a detectable viraemia following a similar challenge. The levels of neutralising antibody (<b>neutralisation</b> <b>index</b> 1. 9 - 3. 1) in the mice protected against challenge with 10 (6) TCID 50 Ross River virus were similar to those in 16 former epidemic polyarthritis patients (1. 1 - 3. 5) who had not experienced a second clinical infection with Ross River virus in the 20 years following their initial infection...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND In this study, we {{evaluated}} {{the role of}} free-living domestic pigeons (Columba livia) as a reservoir of arboviruses {{in the city of}} Belém, state of Pará, Brazil. We investigated the presence of antibodies against the most prevalent arboviruses. OBJECTIVES This study was aimed at evaluating some clinical and physical parameters of domestic pigeons, including the presence of antibodies to Amazon-endemic arboviruses. METHODS Eighty-five healthy pigeons were captured in Mangal das Garças Park, in Belém, and were bled. Upon capture, the birds were subjected to a clinical examination in search of alterations that could indicate the presence of arboviruses. Blood samples were converted to serum and tested using the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) technique with a panel of 19 antigens of arboviruses circulating in the Amazon. The confirmation assay for the positive reactions to the viral species tested by HI was a neutralisation test in new-born Swiss albino mice (Mus musculus) [mouse neutralisation test (MNT) ]. FINDINGS A total of 10 (11. 8 %) serum samples tested positive for antiflavivirus antibodies by HI. All the samples positive for the HI test were subjected to MNT for detection of viruses and yielded negative results (logarithmic <b>neutralisation</b> <b>index</b> < 1. 7). MAIN CONCLUSION The results represent the first serological detection of antiarbovirus antibodies in domestic pigeons as potential hosts of arboviruses in Brazil. The detection of haemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies against genus Flavivirus indicated that there was recent contact between the analysed domestic pigeons and these arboviruses. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of free-living pigeons in the maintenance cycle and spread of arboviruses in the Amazon...|$|E
