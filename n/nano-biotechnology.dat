Apart from agricultural applications, CNTs are also being investigated as molecular transporters also in animal cells for medical purpose [84 – 90].

40|$|By {{controlling}} {{the growth of}} inorganic crystals, macro-biomolecules, including proteins, play pivotal roles in modulating biomineralization. Natural proteins that promote biomineralization are often composed of simple repeats of peptide sequences; however, {{the relationship between these}} repetitive structures and their functions remains largely unknown.

Mutational analyses revealed that the physicochemical characteristics of the protein, not the peptide sequence per se, were responsible for formation of the dendritic structures. This suggests that proteins that modulate crystal growth may have evolved as repeat-containing forms at a relatively high rate.
