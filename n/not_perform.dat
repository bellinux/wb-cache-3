5|$|Adders execute integer {{addition}} {{in electronic}} digital computers, usually using binary arithmetic. The simplest architecture is the ripple carry adder, which follows the standard multi-digit algorithm. One slight improvement is the carry skip design, again following human intuition; one does <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> all the carries in computing , but one bypasses {{the group of}} 9s and skips to the answer.|$|E
5|$|After the deicing {{truck was}} repaired, the pilot {{requested}} a second deicing, though {{the flight crew}} did <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> a walkaround of their airplane, and USAir procedures did not require them to do so. Following the second deicing, LaGuardia ground control granted Flight 405 permission to taxi to Runway 13. The flight crew completed the pre-flight checklist during the taxi.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{the study}} was to analyse the {{prevalence}} and factors associated with <b>not</b> <b>performing</b> physical exercise in undergraduate students. Methods. The sample was composed of 2738 undergraduate students of Londrina city, Parana, Brazil. The dependent variables were: <b>not</b> <b>performing</b> physical exercise of moderate intensity for at least 30 minutes per week; <b>not</b> <b>performing</b> vigorous physical exercise for at least 20 minutes per week; <b>not</b> <b>performing</b> muscular strengthening exercises (8 - 12 repetitions) in a week. The independent variables were gender, age, skin colour, marital status, housing, study pattern, year of course, paid work, and area of the course. Odds ratio (OR) was estimated by multivariate analysis with the use of binary logistic regression. Results. The prevalence of undergraduate students <b>not</b> <b>performing</b> physical exercise of moderate intensity, of vigorous intensity, or muscular strengthening exercises was 47. 3, 61. 0, and 66. 2 %, respectively. Female sex was associated with a risk of <b>not</b> <b>performing</b> moderate physical exercise (OR = 1. 23), vigorous physical exercise (OR = 1. 47), and strengthening exercises (OR = 1. 22). Undergraduate students of exact sciences (OR = 1. 40 and 1. 52), juridical sciences (OR = 1. 48 and 1. 51), and humanities (OR = 1. 45 and 1. 52) were at risk of <b>not</b> <b>performing</b> physical exercise of moderate or vigorous intensity, respectively. Being a 2 nd (OR = 0. 79), 3 rd (OR = 0. 74), or 4 th (OR = 0. 71) year student was bound with a lower likelihood of <b>not</b> <b>performing</b> physical exercise of moderate intensity. Conclusions. Intervention programmes with the aim of promoting physical exercise practice in undergraduate students should consider gender, year, and area of the course...|$|R

5|$|Before spring {{training}} in 2009, there was speculation that if Garko did <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> well, he might lose his starting first base job. Garko began practicing the outfield {{position for the}} upcoming season. Eric Wedge stated that Garko would in fact be playing the outfield in {{spring training}}. On June 21, Garko was held {{out of the game}} because of a sprained left wrist.|$|E
5|$|Burnside fought at {{the battles}} of Wilderness and Spotsylvania Court House, {{where he did}} <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> in a {{distinguished}} manner, attacking piecemeal and appearing reluctant to commit his troops to the frontal assaults that characterized these battles. After North Anna and Cold Harbor, he took {{his place in the}} siege lines at Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|Henry VII touched {{seven or}} eight {{infected}} people annually, and there were intervals lasting several years during which he did <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> the ritual at all. Henry VIII (r. 1509–1547) touched 59 people between early January 1530 and late December 1532. The Protestant Edward VI (r. 1547–1553) apparently did <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> the ritual, but the Catholic Mary I (r. 1553–1558) took it somewhat more seriously. Early in her reign, the Protestant Elizabeth I was reluctant {{to participate in a}} ritual whose efficacy she probably doubted. Although she resumed the practice in 1570, after the Roman Catholic Church excommunicated her and alleged that she had lost her healing power, Elizabeth decisively downplayed her own role in the miraculous healing. The Elizabethan surgeon William Clowes, who asserted that the royal touch proved her legitimacy, claimed that Elizabeth could also heal foreigners, citing a Dutchman as an example.|$|E

5|$|On occasions, Kinkladze {{played as}} a second striker, a role with less {{positional}} responsibility. Periods when Kinkladze {{was used in this}} way included Frank Clark's first months as Manchester City manager, and alongside Fabrizio Ravanelli at Derby County. Though a left-footed player, he did <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> well when played as a left winger, and publicly expressed his distaste for playing in the position.|$|E
5|$|The Briscoe Brothers have a {{somewhat}} checkered history with Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG).

5|$|The {{withdrawal}} method (also {{known as}} coitus interruptus) is {{the practice of}} ending intercourse ("pulling out") before ejaculation. The main risk of the withdrawal method is that the man may <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> the maneuver correctly or in a timely manner. First-year failure rates vary from 4% with perfect usage to 22% with typical usage. It is not considered birth control by some medical professionals.|$|E

5|$|Wollstonecraft's feminist critics {{charged that}} the {{masculine}} role for women that she envisioned—one designed for the public sphere but which women could <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> in the public sphere—left women without a specific social position.

5|$|Although the Romans {{had a more}} hostile {{attitude}} {{than the}} Greeks towards the Egyptians, some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued. The art of mummy portraiture flourished, and some Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs, though not {{to the extent that}} the Ptolemies had. The former lived outside Egypt and did <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|Body of Lies was Alexander Witt's first credit as a {{director}} of photography; he had collaborated with Ridley Scott on six feature films previously, beginning as a second unit camera operator on Black Rain (1989). He shot the film in the Super 35 format with spherical lenses, and explained that these lenses offer more flexibility for interior and night pictures than the anamorphic alternative. They used Kodak Vision2 500T 5218 instead of Technicolor's OZ process, which did <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> well in tests in the Moroccan desert.|$|E

5|$|Cerny {{also gave}} input and {{feedback}} on the game's level-design. However, the 3DO did <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> as they had expected, and Universal suggested that the team should switched to Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation to increase sales of the game. The game originally ran on a custom engine developed by Alex Hastings, and was upgraded and converted for the PlayStation within a month. The debut title was called Disruptor, and was released worldwide in November 1996.|$|E
5|$|Crowley was a late {{developer}} as a musician, having originally {{spent time}} on other pursuits, such as studying architecture, painting and photography. Alongside this he wrote songs but did <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> his first show {{until the age}} of 25, some days after finding material he had written in the early 1990s in his attic. He departed from a career in photography around 2004 to enter the music profession on a full-time basis.|$|E
5|$|DJ Hero was {{generally}} well received by game journalists, praising the {{departure from the}} Guitar Hero series-style of gameplay, {{the use of the}} turntable controller to simulate the motions of a DJ and how the game's difficulty curve helps the player to become skilled on it, and the game's soundtrack; several smaller issues were identified as potential improvements for a possible sequel. However, the game did <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> as strongly as expected by industry analysts, believed to be due to the waning interest in music games during 2009; regardless, DJ Hero is stated by NPD Group to be the highest-grossing new intellectual property of 2009 in North America.|$|E
