40|$|Presently, {{implementing}} the 2001 Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy, which requires fire management priorities {{to be set}} {{on the basis of}} maximising the market and <b>non-market</b> values to be conserved or enhanced, is extremely challenging because those charged with {{implementing the}} policy have limited information about the value that society places on <b>non-market</b> resources at risk.

There are substantial gaps in scientific understanding about how the spatial and temporal provision of <b>non-market</b> values are affected by wildfire, and considerable challenges in evaluating social welfare change arising from specific wildfire events.

This paper considers the challenges of supporting economically efficient allocation of wildfire suppression resources in a social cost-benefit analysis framework when <b>non-market</b> values are important. These challenges include substantial gaps in scientific understanding about how the spatial and temporal provision of <b>non-market</b> values are affected by wildfire, the limited utility of benefit transfer in wildfire assessment, a lack of studies that have estimated marginal willingness-to-pay to conserve <b>non-market</b> values, violation of consumer budget constraints, and the infeasibility of valuing indigenous cultural heritage. These challenges present serious impediments to adapting price-based decision-support tools to accommodate <b>non-market</b> values and support decision-making consistent with contemporary federal wildfire policy.

40|$|The study {{examined}} college-choice decisions by {{students at the}} University of Massachusetts Amherst. The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine whether marketing factors controlled by the University have a greater impact on college choice than external environmental factors uncontrollable by the University. The literature showed evidence of considerable research on college choice, student recruitment, and use of marketing strategies in higher education. However, there was no evidence of research comparing the effectiveness of student-recruitment marketing efforts controlled by an institution to factors impacting college choice over which an institution has little or no control. In view of the expanding use of marketing strategies in higher education today, this represents a significant research void. The present research also examined student demographic characteristics as they relate to college choice, and the importance of institutional attributes in the college-choice process. ^ Four hundred fifty-three UMass freshmen (2 ̆ 704) completed the survey. The results showed that <b>non-marketing</b> factors were more influential on the respondents 2 ̆ 7 college-choice decisions than marketing factors. The most strongly influential marketing factors were the campus visit and information about a specific major. The most strongly influential <b>non-marketing</b> factors were parents and friends.

Females rated marketing factors as more strongly influential than males. With the exception of television and radio ads, out-of-state students rated marketing factors as more strongly influential on their college-choice decisions than in-state students.

40|$|Choosing {{the optimal}} {{harvesting}} time in multiple-use, even-aged forest management {{is an important}} but difficult problem. The usual formulation of the problem requires explicit knowledge {{of the value of}} the timber, plus the value of the other, non-timber and mainly <b>non-market</b> values. The latter are notoriously difficult to measure. This paper develops a harvesting rule that depends only implicitly on the flow of <b>non-market</b> values. The rule, dubbed the “implicit value formula,” gives the minimum stream of <b>non-market</b> values that would induce a landowner to adopt a given rotation length. Since harvesting decisions must be made with or without information on <b>non-market</b> values, the implicit value formula can provide guidance to forest managers by putting a lower bound on the <b>non-market</b> values for every rotation length. As a demonstration, implicit <b>non-market</b> values are calculated for Douglas fir. The implicit value formula indicates that preserving a forest of Douglas fir beyond the optimal rotation is much more expensive than harvesting it an equivalent length of time before the optimal rotation.

40|$|Purpose – The {{marketing}} {{concept is}} an idea that has been adopted in <b>non-marketing</b> contexts, such as the relationships between universities and their students. This paper aims to posit that marketing metaphors are inappropriate to describe the student-university relationship. Design/methodology/approach – The authors provide a conceptual discussion of the topic. Findings – The use of marketing metaphors appears sometimes to be indiscriminate and the appropriateness to use them in student-university relationships is questioned in this article. Research limitations/implications – This notion of students as customers has caused a misinterpretation {{of the relationship between}} universities and students. Practical implications – Students should not be viewed as customers of the university, but as citizens of the university community. The contention contained within this paper is that the customer metaphor is inappropriate to describe students 2 ̆ 7 relationships to universities. Originality/value – The use of marketing buzzwords does not contribute to a correct description or an accurate understanding of the student-university relationship. On the contrary, misconceptions and misunderstandings flourish due to misleading terminology and contradictory vocabulary.

Based on a cross-country survey of 111 M & A practitioners who were personally involved in cross-border M & As around the world, we test seven hypotheses on various market and <b>non-market</b> aspects of post-merger integration. We find a positive correlation between buffering strategies and adaptive capabilities in the <b>non-market</b> environment and between bridging and adaptive capabilities in the market environment. However, we could not find any significant correlation between buffering and adaptive capabilities in the market environment and bridging and adaptive capabilities in the <b>non-market</b> environment.

The results of a systematic review of business model literature are presented and utilise both the citation counts and the h-index to bjectively demonstrate the limited engagement that the marketing discipline has had with business model literature, and the limited degree that the discipline has influenced that literature.

Using the most influential articles identified in the analysis, the paper concludes with a case for the empirical development of the business model concept with industrial marketing scholarship.

40|$|This paper posits a {{model of}} firm–employee {{relationship}} strength that permits the future measurement of an index {{of the strength of}} intra-firm relationships between the firm and the employees of that firm. The relationship marketing literature currently provides no clear direction as to how to represent and measure the strength of firm–employee relationships. The proposed model emerges from an examination of previous marketing and <b>non-marketing</b> literature through exploration of possible concepts to represent measuring strong and productive work relationships, focusing on relationship strength as the construct of interest. The review of the literature on the concept of relationship strength results in the development of an index model of firm–employee relationship strength predicted by cooperation, balanced power, communication, attachment, shared goals and values, trust and the absence of damaging conflict.
