25|$|The {{fuel mixture}} is {{automatically}} altitude-controlled by the automatic mixture control. It operates by bleeding higher pressure air from chamber B into chamber A as it flows though a tapered <b>needle</b> <b>valve.</b> The <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> {{is controlled by}} an aneroid bellows that senses barometric pressure, causing a leaning of the mixture as altitude increases.|$|E
25|$|The {{regulator}} {{ensures that}} {{pressure of the}} gas from the tanks matches the required pressure in the hose. The flow rate is then adjusted by the operator using needle valves on the torch. Accurate flow control with a <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> relies on a constant inlet pressure.|$|E
50|$|Small, simple <b>needle</b> <b>valves</b> {{are often}} used as bleed valves in water-heating applications.|$|R
50|$|Since {{flow rates}} are low and many turns of the valve stem are {{required}} to completely open or close, <b>needle</b> <b>valves</b> are not used for simple shutoff applications.|$|R
2500|$|Needle valves: Mass {{flow meters}} may be {{purchased}} with mass flow controllers which permit setting flow rates. [...] These are expensive, however. Respirometry research often {{will attempt to}} measure more than one animal at a time, which would necessitate one chamber per animal and thus controlled flow through each chamber. [...] An alternative and more cost-effective method to control flow would be via stainless steel or carbon steel <b>needle</b> <b>valves.</b> <b>Needle</b> <b>valves</b> plus mass flow meters provides a cost-effective means to achieve desired flow rates. The valves cost about $20.|$|R
25|$|The {{scheme was}} {{extended}} in 1984 {{with the addition}} of the Drumjohn power station which made use of the existing <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> where the water from Loch Doon and the Deuch feed into the Dee. This station has a capacity of just 2.3 megawatts, but was constructed largely using existing infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|Hollow jet valves are {{a type of}} <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> {{used for}} {{floodgate}} discharge. A cone and seat are inside a pipe. Water flows through an annular gap between the pipe and cone when it is moved downstream, away from the seat. Ribs support the bulb assembly and supply air for water jet stabilization.|$|E
25|$|Constant {{mass flow}} {{addition}} valves {{are used to}} supply a constant mass flow of fresh gas to an active type semi-closed rebreather to replenish the gas used by the diver and to maintain an approximately constant composition of the loop mix. Two main types are used: the fixed orifice and the adjustable orifice (usually a <b>needle</b> <b>valve).</b> The constant mass flow valve is usually based on a gas regulator that is isolated from the ambient pressure so that it provides an absolute pressure regulated output (not compensated for ambient pressure). This limits the depth range in which constant mass flow is possible through the orifice, but provides a relatively predictable gas mixture in the breathing loop. An over-pressure relief valve {{in the first stage}} is used to protect the output hose. Unlike most other diving regulators, these do not control the downstream pressure, but they do regulate the flow rate.|$|E

50|$|<b>Needle</b> <b>valves</b> {{are usually}} used in {{flow-metering}} applications, especially when a constant, calibrated, {{low flow rate}} must be maintained for some time, such as the idle fuel flow in a carburettor.|$|R
50|$|<b>Needle</b> <b>valves</b> {{are also}} {{commonly}} used to provide shut off for the pressure gauge or on applicators to shut off the supply of NH3 to the knives in Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3) applications.|$|R
60|$|She stopped two motorists. The {{first was}} sure that there was dirt {{on the point of}} the <b>needle</b> <b>valve,</b> in the carburetor. While Claire shuddered lest he never get it back, he took out the <b>needle</b> <b>valve,</b> wiped it, put it back--and the engine was again started, and again, with great promptness, it stopped.|$|E

50|$|<b>Needle</b> <b>valves</b> {{may also}} be used in vacuum systems, when a precise control of gas flow is required, at low pressure, such as when filling {{gas-filled}} vacuum tubes, gas lasers and similar devices.|$|R
50|$|Operating {{positions}} for 2-port valves {{can be either}} shut (closed) so that no flow at all goes through, fully open for maximum flow, or sometimes partially open to any degree in between. Many valves are not designed to precisely control intermediate degree of flow; such valves {{are considered to be}} either open or shut. Some valves are specially designed to regulate varying amounts of flow. Such valves have been called by various names such as regulating, throttling, metering, or <b>needle</b> <b>valves.</b> For example, <b>needle</b> <b>valves</b> have elongated conically-tapered discs and matching seats for fine flow control. For some valves, there may be a mechanism to indicate by how much the valve is open, but in many cases other indications of flow rate are used, such as separate flow meters.|$|R
50|$|He, {{along with}} his brother Elmer, {{was the first to}} create one of the world's first horseless carriages, and Edgar was the first to install the {{anti-friction}} bearings and opposed cylinder gasoline engine and the first to design carburators with <b>needle</b> <b>valves</b> and originator of the double ignition system in 1904.|$|R

50|$|The valve {{is often}} {{described}} as a <b>needle</b> <b>valve,</b> although this is a misnomer. A true <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> uses a tapered needle in a tapered seat, so as to provide fine control over flow rate. The float valve uses a pointed needle against a square-edged seat, to give a positive shut-off.|$|E
25|$|One {{simple way}} to reduce the heat of {{decanting}} is to open valves slowly. With sensitive <b>valves,</b> such as <b>needle</b> <b>valves,</b> the gas can slowly be allowed through the valve so that the pressure increase is slow on the low-pressure side. The pipe-work, joints and valves in the blending system should be designed to minimize sharp bends and sudden constrictions. Sometimes 360-degree loops are present in the pipe-work to reduce vibration.|$|R
40|$|A valve is {{provided}} for accurately controlling {{the flow of}} cryogenic fluids such as liquid nitrogen. The valve comprises a combination of disc and <b>needle</b> <b>valves</b> affixed to a valve stem {{in such a manner}} that the disc and needle are free to rotate about the stem, but are constrained in lateral and vertical movements. This arrangement provides accurate and precise fluid flow control and positive fluid isolation...|$|R

50|$|The {{fuel and}} air mixture is too rich {{when it has}} an excess of fuel, and too lean when there is not enough. The mixture is {{adjusted}} {{by one or more}} <b>needle</b> <b>valves</b> on an automotive carburetor, or a pilot-operated lever on piston-engined aircraft (since the mixture changes with air density and therefore altitude). Independent of air density the (stoichiometric) air to gasoline ratio is 14.7:1, meaning that for each mass unit of gasoline, 14.7 mass units of air are required. There are different stoichiometric ratios for other types of fuel.|$|R
40|$|Sonic <b>needle</b> <b>valves</b> were {{calibrated}} {{to measure}} and control airflow in the suction system for the leading-edge flight test. The procedure and results for the calibration flow test of 4 : 41 flight valves are given. Mass-flow rates, which ranged from 0. 001 to 0. 012 lbm/sec, and maximum back pressure were measured for total temperatures from - 30 F to 75 F and total pressures from 120 to 540 psf. Correlating equations are obtained for mass-flow rate {{as a function of}} total pressure, total temperature, and valve opening length. The most important aspect of flow measurement and control is found to be the measurement of valve opening length...|$|R
30|$|Ethylene {{oligomerization}} {{was performed}} in a transparent glass reaction vessel, equipped with a pressure meter and <b>needle</b> <b>valves</b> for sample injections, with magnetic stirring and heating in an oil bath. After evacuation and flushing with N 2 (three times) and ethylene (twice), the reaction vessel was charged with a quantity of cyclohexane and magnetically stirred under ambient ethylene atmosphere. When the desired reaction temperature was established, a quantity of MAO/alkylaluminum activator, PNP ligand and CrCl 3 (THF) 3 were injected into the reactor. Typically 30 Â min later, the mixture was rapidly cooled to 0 Â Â°C and then the reaction was quenched through the addition of EtOH/HCl (10 Â wt%). The catalytic activity was calculated from the increase in product weight.|$|R
50|$|An {{instrument}} <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> uses a {{tapered pin}} to gradually open {{a space for}} fine control of flow. The flow can be controlled and regulated {{with the use of}} a spindle. A <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> has a relatively small orifice with a long, tapered seat, and a needle-shaped plunger on the end of a screw, which exactly fits the seat.|$|E
50|$|The balloon is {{attached}} to the inflation nozzle and a piece of string is wound around the neck. After donning safety glasses and hearing protection a check is made to ensure the <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> is fully closed. The main valve on the cylinder is then opened, followed by the regulator valve. Next, the <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> is opened and the balloon begins to inflate. As the balloon reaches the correct size the inflation nozzle will begin to lift. At this point the <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> is closed along with the regulator valve and cylinder vale. The string is then used to tie off the balloon neck to ensure that no gas can escape.|$|E
50|$|Mixer {{operation}} is simple, it contains only one moving part, {{that being the}} <b>needle</b> <b>valve.</b> While there are exceptions, a mixer doesn't store fuel {{in a bowl of}} any kind. Fuel is simply fed to the mixer, where due to the effect of Bernoulli's principle, it is self-metered in the venturi created below the weighted piston by the action of the attached <b>needle</b> <b>valve,</b> the method used to this day in the SU carburetor.|$|E
40|$|Final {{report and}} team photo for Project 04 of ME 450, Winter 2009 semester. Current fine needle {{aspiration}} (FNA) devices use hand grips to apply suction and whole-arm movement {{to position the}} needle. Control of the needle placement is not optimal; You cannot use fine motor control, and you cannot feel subtle differences in tissue consistency through which the needle passes. A good solution would be a device {{about the size of}} a pencil that can be manipulated with one hand. After inserting the <b>needle,</b> a <b>valve</b> would be opened to apply suction. Before withdrawing the <b>needle,</b> the <b>valve</b> would be closed or the suction broken in some other way. After the aspiration, air would be forced through the needle to express the sample. Ideally, the device would be disposable and simple to manufacture...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{design and}} {{calibration}} of a capillary flowmeter set was represented. The capillary flowmeters {{will be used}} for measurements of small gas flows having laminar flow regime. The gases (such as, nitrogen, argon, methane, hydrogen and carbon-dioxide) supplied from high pressure gas bottles and passed through capillary flowmeters (1 to 3) at various times. Each capillary flowmeter was made of glass and calibrated with one or two gases. Outlet of the capillary flowmeters were connected to the <b>needle</b> <b>valves</b> which have been used for regulating gas flowrates of the capillary flowmeters. Gases individually passed to a bubble flowmeter, and residence time of gases are recorded by using a stop watch. Then, from collected experimental results actual gas flowrates through the capillary flowmeters are calculated by using Hagen-Poiseuille equation...|$|R
5000|$|A [...] Block and bleed {{manifold}} is {{a hydraulic}} manifold that combines {{one or more}} block/isolate valves, usually ball valves, and one or more bleed/vent valves, usually ball or <b>needle</b> <b>valves,</b> into one component for interface with other components (pressure measurement transmitters, gauges, switches, etc.) of a hydraulic (fluid) system. The purpose of the block and bleed manifold is to isolate or block the flow of fluid in the system so the fluid from upstream of the manifold does not reach other components {{of the system that}} are downstream. Then they bleed off or vent the remaining fluid from the system on the downstream side of the manifold. For example, a block and bleed manifold would be used to stop the flow of fluids to some component, then vent the fluid from that componentâ€™s side of the manifold, in order to effect some kind of work (maintenance/repair/replacement) on that component.|$|R
