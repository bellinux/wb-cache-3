40|$|Almost all large {{corporations}} face decisions on capital allocations. By correctly allocating capital to each line of business, {{a company is}} greatly empowered {{to make the best}} strategic decisions possible. Purpose Of Insurance Company Capital Allocation In property/casualty insurance, the capital allocated to a line of business is designed to act as a cushion against unexpected losses. In the past, insurers used a fairly straightforward method of providing this cushion: The bigger the line of business in terms of <b>net</b> <b>written</b> <b>premium,</b> the greater the amount of capital allocated to that line. For example, if personal auto insurance constituted 70 percent of a book of business, as measured by <b>net</b> <b>written</b> <b>premium,</b> the company assigned 70 percent of its capital to that line and calculated metrics used for policy guidance based on that allocation. Drawbacks Of Premium-Based Allocation Method This method has its drawbacks. Although it recognizes that some lines are bigger than others in terms of net premium written, it {{does not take into account}} the fact that two lines of insurance writing the same amount of business may face very different exposures to unexpected losses. For example, personal auto and medical malpractice may each comprise 50 percent of a company’s written premium. However, personal auto is a stable line of insurance, and its loss profile can generally be gauged with reasonable accuracy. Medical malpractice, on the other hand, is a notoriously volatile line and often incurs losses that could not have been anticipated. Therefore, the capital cushion provided to the latter line of business should be significantly higher than that reserved for the former. Risk-Based Capital Allocation Given the drawbacks of this historical method of allocating capital, analysts have proposed methods of better addressing the risk nature of this process...|$|E

The amount of the premium collected and claims paid in these classes of the insurance is not proportionally distributed.

40|$|In {{the past}} several decades, in {{response}} to the high cost of medical malpractice insurance and the shrinking supply of carriers, dramatic market structure changes have occurred: many health care providers have formed their own companies to offer malpractice coverage. These physician-owned (or “physician-directed) firms may have more informational or risk-sharing advantages over traditional insurers in writing medical malpractice insurance. Moreover, their organizational goals are likely to differ from those of other malpractice carriers. This study uses the 1996 - 1998 NAIC data to examine how physician-directed firms differ from non-physician-directed insurers in their loss reserving practices. Our empirical results show that physician-directed firms and firms that specialize in medical malpractice insurance tend to over reserve more, even though there is no evidence indicating that these firms report more accurate reserves. We also find results consistent with prior research, including evidence of greater over reserving by firms that have higher return on assets, higher unanticipated inflation, and lower <b>net</b> <b>premiums</b> <b>written</b> to surplus ratio, as well as firms that do not belong to a group. ...|$|R
