40|$|TrwC is a relaxase protein, {{which starts}} and {{finishes}} DNA processing during bacterial conjugation in plasmid R 388. TrwC recognizes a specific sequence of DNA (25 nucleotides) in the donor cell: the <b>nic-site.</b> As a model example, a single transversion C 24 G in nic avoids DNA processing by TrwC. Using this simple model, our {{objective was to}} obtain a proof of principle that TrwC specificity can be changed. Several structures of DNA-TrwC complexes were used as reference to design a focused saturation mutagenesis library (NNK) randomizing amino acid Lys 262, since its side chain seems to sterically hinder {{the recognition of the}} C 24 G nic mutation by wild-type TrwC. Using bacterial conjugation as an in vivo selection system, several TrwC variants were found that show changes in substrate specificity. These variants were also tested in a competitive assay to evaluate their conjugation efficiency. Â© 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co. KGaA, Weinheim. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
