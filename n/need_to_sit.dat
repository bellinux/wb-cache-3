500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, when {{baseball}} was slowly becoming integrated, Musial—along with his roommate Red Schoendienst—would be lauded by newcomers such as Dodgers' pitcher Don Newcombe for their tolerance. [...] "They never...had the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> {{in the dugout}} and call a black guy a bunch of names", Newcombe said, [...] "because {{he was trying to}} change the game and make it what it should have been in the first place, a game for all people." ...|$|E

50|$|It is {{impossible}} to convert the mount of a digital back for a different medium format body via adapter or conversion plates, because the sensor would then not sit within the film plane (since the sensor <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> the same distance from the lens that the film would).

50|$|When using buttercream to frost a cake, {{it is best}} to {{work with}} it when it is soft and spreadable. Icings may be stored, covered, in the {{refrigerator}} for several days.

50|$|There are {{two options}} for {{learners}}. Firstly, learners can attend a designated driving school. Graduates from a designated driving school do not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> the practical examination {{but they do}} <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> the written examination. Secondly, learners can attend non-designated driving school or obtain practice through other means, in which case they must sit both the practical and written examinations. The Japanese driving examination consists of a written examination and a practical examination for each level of licence. Most Japanese go to a driving school prior to taking these examinations (though it is not required), and upon completing the course at a non-designated driving school must register for the examinations in the prefecture where they are registered as a resident. The practical examination consists of driving a vehicle through a purpose-designed driving course while obeying relevant rules of the road.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the Volkswagen {{alloy case}} used by Hewland, the Traction Avant case {{could not be}} used up side down, as the input shaft height was much higher in {{relation}} to the output shaft axis so that the oil level <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> lubricate the gears would exceed the then-unreliable input shaft oil seal height if used upside down. So the engine <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> high above the ground with the oil sump space below, which was not needed by dry-sump racing engines. But the French transaxle was used by several racing car constructors in the late 1950s to 60s with various levels of success.|$|R

50|$|Interestingly Mach did {{not have}} a naming service of any sort for its ports. This proved to be a serious problem, because {{programs}} had to know in advance what servers they had to call in order to ask the kernel to provide a port. This meant that replacing functionality was much more difficult than it should have been; a new printer server <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on the same ports as the old one for instance: there would be no way to run two side by side for development. If ports were instead referred to by name, servers could sit on different ports and simply use the same name. This functionality, provided by a name server, was considered highly important under Spring.|$|R
