There he realized that Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, president of the Fusion Party, was the better option to help in this task. While in Spain, Muñoz Rivera received notice that his father had died, which heavily affected him. Upon returning to Puerto Rico, he published an article about his father in La Democracia. He subsequently <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> travel had caused controversy within the Autonomist Party, which became divided between followers of Barbosa and Muñoz Rivera, with the two factions becoming known as Muñocistas and Barbosistas.|$|E

The Turkish force, consisting of Kilij Arslan I and his ally Hasan of Cappadocia, along {{with help from}} the Danishmendids, led by the Turkish prince Danishmend Gazi, the Persians, and the Caucasian Albanians. Contemporary figures place this number between 25,000-30,000, more recent estimates are between 6,000 and 8,000 men.|$|E
25|$|Kohner, a Czechoslovakian Jew, {{worked in}} the German film {{industry}} as a screenwriter until 1933 when he emigrated to Hollywood after the Nazis started removing Jewish credits from films. Over the coming decades Kohner and his wife Franzie raised their two daughters by the beach while he toiled as a screenwriter for Columbia Pictures. As his children grew into American teenagers he <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> daughter Kathy in particular was drawn into a very specific, regional, contemporary slice of American teenage culture – the surf culture.|$|E
25|$|Some clocks have a timing {{adjustment}} (a fast-slow control). When {{the owner}} compared his wall clock's {{time to the}} reference time, he <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> clock was too fast. Consequently, he could turn the timing adjust a small amount to make the clock run a little slower (frequency). If things work out right, his clock will be more accurate than before. Over a series of weekly adjustments, the wall clock's notion of a second would agree with the reference time (locked both in frequency and phase within the wall clock's stability).|$|E

25|$|He {{continued}} on, encountering village after village, {{doing as}} he had done before and he was given a wife every time. Xwechtáal received wives from all the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh until he finally returned home to Stá7mes. Just as before, the village came forward and watched as he used his magical powers. This time was different. Xwechtáal had <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> first wife, from before he left on his journey, had remarried. He also realized he was not gone four days like he expected, but 10 years had passed. Instead of reviving the entire village, he left his ex-wife and her husband dead.|$|E
25|$|During 1968, Collins <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> {{legs were}} not working as they should, first during {{handball}} games, then {{as he walked}} down stairs, his knee would almost give way. His left leg also had unusual sensations when in hot and cold water. Reluctantly he sought medical advice and the diagnosis was a cervical disc herniation, requiring two vertebrae to be fused together. The surgery was performed at Wilford Hall Hospital at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, and he spent three months in a neck brace. It also removed Collins from the crew of Apollo 9 and moved Jim Lovell up to the prime crew. When the Apollo 8 mission was changed from a CSM/LM in Earth orbit, to a CSM-only flight around the Moon, both prime and backup crews for the Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 swapped places.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} good friends, Rabbi Dovber and Rabbi Aharon {{disagreed}} about the emphasis on, and correct method of, emotional expression in Chassidic prayer. According to Rabbi Dovber, the greatest service a Jew can perform in worship is to totally nullify himself before The Creator. Therefore, maintained Rabbi Dovber, a person's meditation can {{appear to be}} cold and emotionless on the exterior, where the prayer causes the person praying to feel oneself one with The Creator. To that end, Rabbi Dovber prayed with great D'veikus (cleaving), rather than with Hispaylus (excitement), where the one praying gets excited over the Creator but remains, in his own feeling and understanding, a separate entity and existence. Rabbi Dovber prayed while perfectly still, hardly moving. His outward countenance remained completely unaffected. It {{is important to note}} this mode of davening was something personal to him, as he was able to conceal his emotions, rather than something he recommended for everyone. When the Rebbe DovBer <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> chassidim (followers) thought that they should be devoid of any emotional appearance, he wrote a public letter stating that this is wrong. His disagreement with Rabbi Aharon was rather that he felt that there must be an understanding of Godliness and a cleaving, in other words that one's emotional feeling be a lasting one, not one that would evaporate after a short time.|$|E

500|$|During Bure's {{rehabilitation}} period, {{following his}} first major knee injury in 1995, Canucks' conditioning coach Peter Twist <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> skating style was distinct in comparison to typical North American players. He explained: [...] "Most players skate on their inside edge and push off at a 45-degree angle, but Bure starts on his outer edge and rolls over to his inside edge and pushes back straighter on his stride... he gets more power and force in his stride {{to get up to}} top speed quicker." [...] his skating was also complemented by his ability to deke out defenders and goaltenders at top speeds, making him capable of routinely starting end-to-end rushes. However, several knee injuries, and the resulting reconstructive surgeries, compromised the speed that defined Bure's game, ultimately leading to his retirement.|$|E
500|$|Kippax {{came back}} for the third Test at Melbourne and rewarded {{the faith of the}} {{selectors}} by scoring 52 and 67, his two highest first-class innings of the season. However, his best knock of the summer came on another rain-affected pitch at Melbourne in the final Test. He batted [...] "serenely" [...] to top score with an elegant 42. The entire South Africa team only managed 36 and 45 in their two completed innings on a [...] "treacherous" [...] wicket. As compensation for his lack of runs, Kippax led NSW to victory over Victoria in late January, which clinched the Sheffield Shield title for the state. During the winter of 1932, Kippax joined a private team that toured Canada and the USA, a tour organised by ex-Test bowler Arthur Mailey. Teammates <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> confidence was shaken by the blows to the head, and he no longer employed his famous hook shot.|$|E

After reaching the milestone, PewDiePie tweeted [...] "will delete tomorrow 5pm gmt," [...] in reference to his channel, before later uploading a celebratory video featuring fireworks. Ultimately, he did not delete his PewDiePie channel, and instead shut down the joke Jack septiceye2 channel, stating [...] "You know {{when you make a}} joke and it just blows up way bigger than you'd imagined?" [...] PewDiePie's stunt received negative reception from Fortune. The publication's Mathew Ingram opined, [...] "this is just a temper tantrum by a man-baby who makes millions of dollars playing video games," [...] adding, [...] "at first glance, the video in which he threatens to delete his channel seems like the whining of a rich, entitled celebrity who has <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> videos aren’t getting as many views as they used to, and blames the platform for not supporting him as much as he thinks they should." [...] On 18 December 2016, he received a Ruby Play Button from YouTube as a reward for hitting 50 million subscribers.|$|E

500|$|Early in {{his major}} league career, Rivera was a [...] "power pitcher" [...] who relied on an overpowering four-seam fastball that topped out at [...] to retire hitters. By {{enticing}} them to swing and miss at pitches {{high in the}} strike zone, he accumulated strikeouts at a high rate. Rivera changed his pitching style after accidentally discovering how to throw a cutter in June 1997; during his daily warm-up tosses with teammate Ramiro Mendoza, Rivera <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> fastballs were moving sharply and unpredictably, a problem that began to occur in games as well. After unsuccessfully spending a month trying to eliminate the movement, Rivera relented and incorporated the cutter into his pitching repertoire, eventually {{making it one of}} his primary pitches in 1998. When asked about the pitch's origin, he explained, [...] "It was just from God. I didn't do anything. It was natural." [...] As he came to rely on the cutter, Rivera began to record more outs on batted balls. Consequently, his strikeout rate decreased in subsequent years, dropping from 10.87strikeouts per 9innings in 1996 to 5.3 in 1998, but at the benefit of more efficiency; his pitches per inning rate dropped from 18.7 in 1995 to 14.9 in 1998.|$|E
500|$|American Pharoah faced a {{field of}} 10 horses, most of whom, {{including}} Keen Ice, he had previously defeated. [...] Espinoza had concerns at the starting gate when he <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> mount was already sweating, even though the weather was not particularly hot. [...] While the horse led {{for much of the}} race, he was hard-pressed throughout by Frosted, a change from Frosted's previous stalking style, attributed to a rider change less than an hour before the race, when Jose Lezcano replaced an injured Joel Rosario, altering the [...] "complexion" [...] of the race. [...] The unexpected tactics of Lezcano may have been decisive. Espinoza stated that he [...] "knew he was in trouble" [...] by the half-mile pole because American Pharoah did not pull away from his rival and lacked his usual energy. Frosted challenged American Pharoah for the lead at the far turn, and the horses bumped several times, but American Pharoah dug in and fought back when Frosted took a very brief lead. While American Pharoah fended off the challenge from Frosted, Keen Ice was coming up on the outside, also under a new jockey, Javier Castellano. They overtook American Pharoah at the sixteenth pole, going on to defeat him by three-quarters of a length. Once again the Saratoga track lived up to its reputation.|$|E
500|$|In January 2007, Cane debuted as a {{bartender}} at [...] "Indigo", Neil Winters' (Kristoff St. John) nightclub, {{remaining in the}} United States beyond the expiration of his visa, leaving him fearful of being deported. Thereafter, he became involved with Amber Moore (Adrienne Frantz), who first used him to make Adrian Korbel (Eyal Podell) jealous and later found out Cane was looking for his birth mother. He had been adopted by a woman named Violet Montgomery and raised by her brother, Langley Ashby, after her death in Canberra, Australia. Amber {{was trying to find}} Phillip Chancellor III, Jill Abbott's (Jess Walton) lost son, who was really switched at birth with another child by Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper). Amber realized that Cane might be Jill's son and decided to marry him; they went to Las Vegas, became intoxicated and Amber tricked Cane into thinking they were married. Amber's suspicions of Cane being Jill's son were proven true, and Cane shared a reunion with Jill, as well as prevented his deportation. Cane and Amber then moved into the Chancellor Estate and he began working for Katherine's company. Cane then found their marriage certificate and <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> signature was unrecognizable, leading to his discovery that the marriage was invalid. Cane then rejected a devastated Amber. Cane shared a kiss with Lily Winters (Christel Khalil) in September 2007, sparking an attraction to Heather Stevens (Vail Bloom). Cane and Heather decided to be friends and Cane pursued Lily romantically, despite initial hesitations due to their age difference. Lily then became pregnant with Cane's child but soon miscarries. They later move into a house together, and Cane proposes in August 2008; she accepts. Cane then passed out intoxicated in Chloe Mitchell's (Elizabeth Hendrickson) car, Chloe takes advantage of Cane and tricks him into believing they slept together. Chloe was pregnant prior to her scheme but Cane was not excluded as a possible father. Lily moved out of their house upon this discovery and convinced Cane to marry Chloe {{for the sake of the}} child, however, Chloe's real identity was Kate Valentine, daughter of Esther Valentine (Kate Linder). Cane had the marriage annulled but still decided to stay with Chloe. Billy Abbott (Billy Miller) then discovered he was the father of Chloe's child, but decided to let Cane raise it. Billy and Lily then began an affair despite Cane still being in love with Lily and Chloe with Billy. Cane later discovers that the child, Delia, was not his and was convinced by Lily not to fight for custody but instead resume their relationship; they were later married.|$|E
