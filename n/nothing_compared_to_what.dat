500|$|Occasional successes notwithstanding, Holst {{found that}} [...] "man cannot live by {{composition}} alone"; he took posts as organist at various London churches, and continued playing the trombone in theatre orchestras. In 1898 {{he was appointed}} first trombonist and répétiteur with the Carl Rosa Opera Company and toured with the Scottish Orchestra. Though a capable rather than a virtuoso player he won the praise of the leading conductor Hans Richter, for whom he played at Covent Garden. His salary was only just enough to live on, and he supplemented it by playing in a popular orchestra called the [...] "White Viennese Band", conducted by Stanislas Wurm. Holst enjoyed playing for Wurm, and learned much from him about drawing rubato from players. Nevertheless, longing to devote his time to composing, Holst found the necessity of playing for [...] "the Worm" [...] or any other light orchestra [...] "a wicked and loathsome waste of time". Vaughan Williams did not altogether agree with his friend about this; he admitted {{that some of the}} music was [...] "trashy" [...] but thought it had been useful to Holst nonetheless: [...] "To start with, the very worst a trombonist has to put up with is as <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> a church organist has to endure; and secondly, Holst is above all an orchestral composer, and that sure touch which distinguishes his orchestral writing is due largely {{to the fact that he}} has been an orchestral player; he has learnt his art, both technically and in substance, not at second hand from text books and models, but from actual live experience." ...|$|E

2500|$|Due to past experiences, {{in later}} years Marriott became wary of success and fame as well as {{involvement}} with big record companies, and turned down lucrative concert and recording deals with names such as EMI. Because of this attitude, the band grew resentful, believing that he was holding them back, and Packet of Three was disbanded. For the next year Marriott took time off. By now he was 39 years old. He had health problems, was overweight, and had a scruffy appearance. There was little left of the striking 1960s mod icon.

6000|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. There {{was your}} mistake. There was your error. The error all women commit. Why can’t you women love us, faults and all? Why do you place us on monstrous pedestals? We have all feet of clay, {{women as well}} as men; but when we men love women, we love them knowing their weaknesses, their follies, their imperfections, love them all the more, it may be, for that reason. It is not the perfect, but the imperfect, who have need of love. It is when we are wounded by our own hands, or by the hands of others, that love should come to cure us—else what use is love at all? All sins, except a sin against itself, Love should forgive. All lives, save loveless lives, true Love should pardon. A man’s love is like that. It is wider, larger, more human than a woman’s. Women think that they are making ideals of men. What they are making of us are false idols merely. You made your false idol of me, and I had not the courage to come down, show you my wounds, tell you my weaknesses. I was afraid that I might lose your love, as I have lost it now. And so, last night you ruined my life for me—yes, ruined it! What this woman asked of me was <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> she offered to me.

6000|$|Nobody will {{deny that}} these were admirable regulations, {{and that they were}} {{received}} as such at the time by the Zulu king and people. But {{there is no doubt that}} their ready acceptance by the king was a sacrifice to his desire to please [...] "his father Sompseu" [...] (Mr. Shepstone) and the Natal Government, with both of which he was particularly anxious to be on good terms. He has never adhered to these coronation regulations, or promises, as they have been called, and the probability is that he never intended to adhere to them. However this may be, I must say that personally I have been unable to share the views of those who see in the breach of these so-called promises a justification of the Zulu war. After all, what do they amount to, and what guarantee was there for their fulfilment? They merely represent a very laudable attempt on the part of the Natal Government to keep a restraining hand on Zulu cruelty, and to draw the bonds of friendship as tight as the idiosyncrasies of a savage state would allow. The Government of Natal had no right to dictate the terms to a Zulu king on which he was to hold his throne. The Zulu nation was an independent nation, and had never been conquered or annexed by Natal. If the Government of that colony was able by friendly negotiation to put a stop to Zulu slaughter, it was a matter for congratulation on humanitarian grounds; but it is difficult to follow the argument that because it was not able, or was only partially able, to do so, therefore England was justified in making war on the Zulus. On the other hand, it is perfectly ludicrous to observe the way in which Cetywayo's advocates overshoot the mark in arguing this and similar points; especially his lady advocates, whose writings upon these subjects bear about the same resemblance to the truth that the speech to the jury by the counsel for the defence in a hopeless murder case does to the summing up of the judge. Having demonstrated that the engagements entered into by Cetywayo meant nothing, they will proceed to show that, even if they did, cold-blooded murder, when perpetrated by a black paragon like Cetywayo, does not amount to a great offence. In the mouths of these gentle apologists for slaughter, massacre masquerades under the name of [...] "executions," [...] and is excused on the plea of being, [...] "after all," [...] only the enforcement of [...] "an old custom." [...] Again, the employment of such phrases, in a solemn answer to a remonstrance from the Lieutenant-Governor of Natal, as [...] "I do kill; but do not consider that I have done anything yet in the way of killing. [...] . I have not yet begun; I have yet to kill," [...] are shown to mean nothing at all, and to be [...] "nothing more than the mere irritation of the moment."[*] Perhaps those of Cetywayo's subjects who suffered on account of this mere momentary irritation took a more serious view of it. It is but fair to the particular authority from whom I quote (Miss Colenso's [...] "History of the Zulu War," [...] pp. 230-231) to state that she considers this reply from the [...] "usually courteous and respectful king" [...] as [...] "no doubt petulant and wanting in due respect." [...] Considering that the message in question (which can be read in the footnote) was a point-blank defiance of Sir Henry Bulwer, admitting that there had been slaughter, but that it was <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> was coming, most people will not think Miss Colenso's description of it too strong.|$|E
