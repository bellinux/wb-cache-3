5|$|Natural {{processes}} {{can also}} introduce toxic substances into <b>nontoxic</b> honey produced from <b>nontoxic</b> nectar. Microorganisms in honey can convert {{some of the}} sugars in honey to ethanol. This process of ethanol fermentation is intentionally harnessed to produce the alcoholic beverage called mead from fermented honey.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{researchers}} began to evaluate bismuth as a <b>nontoxic</b> replacement for lead in various applications.|$|E
5|$|A hamster {{in captivity}} can {{occasionally}} eat mealworms or earthworms, which have high protein contents. Boiled {{egg whites and}} small pieces of clean, cooked chicken are also sources of extra protein. They can also eat wheat grain, sunflower seeds, and locusts. The teeth of Campbell's dwarf hamster never stop growing. Like all rodents, they must therefore gnaw regularly to keep their incisors from growing into {{the skin of the}} mouth and causing pain and irritation. Smooth, young wood from <b>nontoxic</b> trees, such as apple and willow, is readily used by most species in the genus. Most pet stores sell <b>nontoxic</b> wooden chews designed for rodents in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Barium is not {{carcinogenic}} and it {{does not}} bioaccumulate. Inhaled dust containing insoluble barium compounds can accumulate in the lungs, causing a benign condition called baritosis. The insoluble sulfate is <b>nontoxic</b> and is not classified as a dangerous goods in transport regulations.|$|E
5|$|Elemental boron, boron oxide, boric acid, borates, {{and many}} {{organoboron}} compounds are relatively <b>nontoxic</b> to {{humans and animals}} (with toxicity {{similar to that of}} table salt). The LD50 (dose at which there is 50% mortality) for animals is about 6g per kg of body weight. Substances with LD50 above 2g are considered <b>nontoxic.</b> An intake of 4g/day of boric acid was reported without incident, but more than this is considered toxic in more than a few doses. Intakes of more than 0.5grams per day for 50 days cause minor digestive and other problems suggestive of toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Argon has {{approximately}} the same solubility in water as oxygen and is 2.5 times more soluble in water than nitrogen. Argon is colorless, odorless, nonflammable and <b>nontoxic</b> as a solid, liquid or gas. Argon is chemically inert under most conditions and forms no confirmed stable compounds at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|On August 15, 2017, {{water was}} {{restored}} to the fountain as a test run, with the intention that it will stay on until November, when the ice rink reopens. The water has been dyed with the 'Blue Lagoon' aquatic dye to control the growth of algae and bacteria. The <b>nontoxic</b> aquatic dye attenuates the penetration of light into the water, and tints the water blue.|$|E
5|$|Though {{virtually}} unseen in nature, high-purity bismuth {{can form}} distinctive, colorful hopper crystals. It is relatively <b>nontoxic</b> {{and has a}} low melting point just above 271°C, so crystals may be grown using a household stove, although the resulting crystals will tend to be lower quality than lab-grown crystals.|$|E
5|$|A {{chelating}} agent is a molecule {{with at least}} two negatively charged groups that allow it to form complexes with metal ions with multiple positive charges, such as lead. The chelate that is thus formed is <b>nontoxic</b> and can be excreted in the urine, initially at up to 50 times the normal rate. The {{chelating agent}}s used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate disodium calcium (CaNa2EDTA), dimercaprol (BAL), which are injected, and succimer and d-penicillamine, which are administered orally.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, {{thallium}} {{is produced}} not from potassium ores, {{but as a}} byproduct from refining of heavy metal sulfide ores. Approximately 60–70% of thallium production {{is used in the}} electronics industry, and the remainder is used in the pharmaceutical industry and in glass manufacturing. It is also used in infrared detectors. The radioisotope thallium-201 (as the soluble chloride TlCl) is used in small, <b>nontoxic</b> amounts as an agent in a nuclear medicine scan, during one type of nuclear cardiac stress test.|$|E
5|$|Despite its toxicity, T.floccosus {{is one of}} the ten wild {{mushrooms}} most widely consumed by ethnic tribes in Meghalaya, northeast India, and is highly regarded by the Sherpa people in the vicinity of Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal. What is not known is whether the Indian populations of T.floccosus are <b>nontoxic,</b> or whether the local people have developed an immunity to it. It is also enjoyed in Mexico. American mycologist David Arora reported that some enjoyed it while he felt it had a strong sour taste.|$|E
5|$|The {{photostability}} of pigments can {{be enhanced}} {{by the addition of}} cerium. It provides pigments with light fastness and prevents clear polymers from darkening in sunlight. Television glass plates are subject to electron bombardment, which tends to darken them by creation of F-center color centers. This effect is suppressed by addition of cerium oxide. Cerium is also an essential component of phosphors used in TV screens and fluorescent lamps. Cerium sulfide forms a red pigment that stays stable up to 350°C. The pigment is a <b>nontoxic</b> alternative to cadmium sulfide pigments.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the price rose rapidly {{as a result}} of {{increasing}} demand for bismuth as a metallurgical additive to aluminium, iron and steel. This was followed by a decline owing to increased world production, stabilized consumption, and the recessions of 1980 and 1981–82. In 1984, the price began to climb as consumption increased worldwide, especially in the United States and Japan. In the early 1990s, research began on the evaluation of bismuth as a <b>nontoxic</b> replacement for lead in ceramic glazes, fishing sinkers, food-processing equipment, free-machining brasses for plumbing applications, lubricating greases, and shot for waterfowl hunting. Growth in these areas remained slow during the middle 1990s, in spite of the backing of lead replacement by the US Government, but intensified around 2005. This resulted in a rapid and continuing increase in price.|$|E
5|$|Molten salt can be {{employed}} as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant, {{so that it can}} be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995–1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity. The molten salt mixtures vary. The most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate. It is non-flammable and <b>nontoxic,</b> and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.|$|E
5|$|Soluble thulium salts are mildly toxic, but {{insoluble}} thulium salts {{are completely}} <b>nontoxic.</b> When injected, thulium can cause degeneration {{of the liver}} and spleen and can also cause hemoglobin concentration to fluctuate. Liver damage from thulium is more prevalent in male mice than female mice. Despite this, thulium has {{a low level of}} toxicity. In humans, thulium occurs in the highest amounts in the liver, kidneys and bones. Humans typically consume several micrograms of thulium per year. The roots of plants do not take up thulium, and the dry weight of vegetables usually contains one part per billion of thulium. Thulium dust and powder are toxic upon inhalation or ingestion and can cause explosions. Radioactive thulium isotopes can cause radiation poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Mucilage from {{prickly pear}} may {{work as a}} natural, <b>nontoxic</b> {{dispersant}} for oil spills.|$|E
25|$|Steam {{sterilization}} is {{the most}} widely used and the most dependable. Steam sterilization is <b>nontoxic,</b> inexpensive, rapidly microbicidal, sporicidal, and rapidly heats and penetrates fabrics.|$|E
25|$|THF is {{considered}} a relatively <b>nontoxic</b> solvent, with the median lethal dose (LD50) comparable to that for acetone. Reflecting its remarkable solvent properties, it penetrates the skin, causing rapid dehydration. THF readily dissolves latex and is typically handled with nitrile or neoprene rubber gloves. It is highly flammable.|$|E
25|$|Hashimoto's {{thyroiditis}} {{is thought}} to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include a family history of the condition and having another autoimmune disease. Diagnosis is confirmed with blood tests for TSH, T4, and antithyroid antibodies. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include Graves’ disease and <b>nontoxic</b> nodular goiter.|$|E
25|$|Originally an {{industrial}} pigment supply company, Crayola soon shifted its focus to art products for {{home and school}} use, beginning with chalk, then crayons, followed later by colored pencils, markers, paints, modeling clay, and other related goods. All Crayola-branded products are marketed as <b>nontoxic</b> and safe for use by children. Most Crayola crayons are maufactured in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Dusts {{have been}} used to ward off insects from grain storage for centuries, {{including}} plant ash, lime, dolomite, certain types of soil, and diatomaceous earth or Kieselguhr. Of these, diatomaceous earth in particular has seen a revival as a <b>nontoxic</b> (when in amorphous form) residual pesticide for bed bug abatement. While diatomaceous earth performed poorly, silica gel may be effective.|$|E
25|$|Organic {{compounds}} of phosphorus form a wide {{class of}} materials; many {{are required for}} life, but some are extremely toxic. Fluorophosphate esters {{are among the most}} potent neurotoxins known. A wide range of organophosphorus compounds are used for their toxicity as pesticides (herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, etc.) and weaponised as nerve agents against enemy humans. Most inorganic phosphates are relatively <b>nontoxic</b> and essential nutrients.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of biopesticides - {{biochemical}} and microbial. Biochemical pesticides are similar to naturally occurring chemicals and are <b>nontoxic,</b> such as insect pheromones used to locate mates, while microbial biopesticides like Green Muscle come from bacteria, fungi, algae or viruses that either occur naturally or are genetically altered. Entomopathogenic fungi generally suppress pests by mycosis: causing a disease that is specific to the insect.|$|E
25|$|Although {{consumer}} {{perception of}} foods treated with irradiation is more negative than those processed by other means, {{a large amount}} of independent research has confirmed irradiation to be safe. One family of chemicals (2ACB's) are uniquely formed by irradiation (unique radiolytic products), and this product is <b>nontoxic.</b> When irradiating food, all other chemicals occur in a lower or comparable frequency to other food processing techniques.|$|E
25|$|An {{effective}} non-surgical {{alternative to}} declawing is {{the application of}} vinyl nail caps (marketed in the US under brand names such as Soft Paws, available through veterinarians, and Soft Claws, sold through pet stores and online) that are affixed to the claws with <b>nontoxic</b> glue, requiring periodic replacement when the cat sheds its claw sheaths (usually every four to six weeks, depending on the cat's scratching habits).|$|E
25|$|Mirtazapine is {{considered}} to be relatively safe {{in the event of an}} overdose, although it {{is considered}} slightly more toxic in overdose than most of the SSRIs (except citalopram). Unlike the TCAs, mirtazapine showed no significant cardiovascular adverse effects at 7 to 22 times the maximum recommended dose. Case reports of overdose with as much as 30 to 50 times the standard dose described the drug as relatively <b>nontoxic,</b> compared to TCAs.|$|E
25|$|Extremely {{high levels}} of {{serotonin}} can cause a condition known as serotonin syndrome, with toxic and potentially fatal effects. In practice, such toxic levels are essentially impossible to reach through an overdose of a single antidepressant drug, but require a combination of serotonergic agents, such as an SSRI with an MAOI. The intensity of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome vary over a wide spectrum, and the milder forms are seen even at <b>nontoxic</b> levels.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} fluids {{have been tested}} to {{transport}} the sun's heat, including water, air, oil, and sodium, but Rockwell International selected molten salt as best. Molten salt is used in solar power tower systems because it is liquid at atmospheric pressure, provides a low-cost medium to store thermal energy, its operating temperatures are compatible with today's steam turbines, and it is non-flammable and <b>nontoxic.</b> Molten salt {{is used in the}} chemical and metals industries to transport heat, so industry has experience with it.|$|E
25|$|Anti-fouling is {{the process}} of {{preventing}} accumulations from forming. In industrial processes, bio-dispersants can be used to control biofouling. In less controlled environments, organisms are killed or repelled with coatings using biocides, thermal treatments, or pulses of energy. <b>Nontoxic</b> mechanical strategies that prevent organisms from attaching include choosing a material or coating with a slippery surface, creation of an ultra-low fouling surface with the use of zwitterions, or creation of nanoscale surface topologies similar to the skin of sharks and dolphins which only offer poor anchor points.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam {{has been}} {{associated}} with severe hepatic disorders, similar to other nitrobenzodiazepines. Nitrobenzodiazepines such as nitrazepam, nimetazepam, flunitrazepam, and clonazepam are more toxic to the liver than other benzodiazepines as they are metabolically activated by CYP3A4 which can result in cytotoxicity. This activation can lead to the generation of free radicals and oxidation of thiol, as well as covalent binding with endogenous macromolecules; this results, then, in oxidation of cellular components or inhibition of normal cellular function. Metabolism of a <b>nontoxic</b> drug to reactive metabolites has been causally connected with a variety of adverse reactions.|$|E
25|$|Environmental {{considerations}} of wine packaging reveal benefits and drawbacks of both bottled and box wines. The glass {{used to make}} bottles is a <b>nontoxic,</b> naturally occurring substance that is completely recyclable, whereas the plastics used for box-wine containers are typically much less environmentally friendly. However, wine-bottle manufacturers have been cited for Clean Air Act violations. A New York Times editorial suggested that box wine, being lighter in package weight, has a reduced carbon footprint from its distribution; however, box-wine plastics, even though possibly recyclable, can be more labor-intensive (and therefore expensive) to process than glass bottles. In addition, while a wine box is recyclable, its plastic bladder most likely is not.|$|E
25|$|Methane is <b>nontoxic,</b> {{yet it is}} {{extremely}} flammable and may form explosive mixtures with air. Methane is violently reactive with oxidizers, halogen, and some halogen-containing compounds. Methane is also an asphyxiant and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space. Asphyxia may result if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below about 16% by displacement, as most people can tolerate a reduction from 21% to 16% without ill effects. The concentration of methane at which asphyxiation risk becomes significant {{is much higher than}} the 5–15% concentration in a flammable or explosive mixture. Methane off-gas can penetrate the interiors of buildings near landfills and expose occupants to significant levels of methane. Some buildings have specially engineered recovery systems below their basements to actively capture this gas and vent it away from the building.|$|E
25|$|Proteins {{constitute}} 90-95% of venom's {{dry weight}} {{and they are}} responsible for almost all of its biological effects. Among hundreds, even thousands of proteins found in venom, there are toxins, neurotoxins in particular, as well as <b>nontoxic</b> proteins (which also have pharmacological properties), and many enzymes, especially hydrolytic ones. Enzymes (molecular weight 13-150 KDa) make-up 80-90% of viperid and 25-70% of elapid venoms: digestive hydrolases, L-amino acid oxidase, phospholipases, thrombin-like pro-coagulant, and kallikrein-like serine proteases and metalloproteinases (hemorrhagins), which damage vascular endothelium. Polypeptide toxins (molecular weight 5-10 KDa) include cytotoxins, cardiotoxins, and postsynaptic neurotoxins (such as α-bungarotoxin and α-Cobratoxin), which bind to acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions. Compounds with low molecular weight (up to 1.5 KDa) include metals, peptides, lipids, nucleosides, carbohydrates, amines, and oligopeptides, which inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and potentiate bradykinin (BPP). Inter- and intra-species variation in venom chemical composition is geographical and ontogenic. Phosphodiesterases interfere with the prey's cardiac system, mainly to lower the blood pressure. Phospholipase A2 causes hemolysis by lysing the phospholipid cell membranes of red blood cells. Amino acid oxidases and proteases are used for digestion. Amino acid oxidase also triggers some other enzymes and is responsible for the yellow colour of the venom of some species. Hyaluronidase increases tissue permeability to accelerate absorption of other enzymes into tissues. Some snake venoms carry fasciculins, like the mambas (Dendroaspis), which inhibit cholinesterase to make the prey lose muscle control.|$|E
500|$|When {{taken in}} normal {{therapeutic}} doses, paracetamol {{has been shown}} to be safe. Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to <b>nontoxic</b> metabolites via Phase II metabolism by conjugation with sulfate and glucuronide, with a small portion being oxidized via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Cytochromes [...] and 3A4 convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with glutathione to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.|$|E
500|$|Fungal {{proteins}} exhibiting templated {{conformational change}} {{were discovered in}} the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by Reed Wickner in the early 1990s. For their mechanistic similarity to mammalian prions, they were termed yeast prions. [...] Subsequent to this, a prion has also {{been found in the}} fungus Podospora anserina. These prions behave similarly to PrP, but, in general, are <b>nontoxic</b> to their hosts. Susan Lindquist's group at the Whitehead Institute has argued some of the fungal prions are not associated with any disease state, but may have a useful role; however, researchers at the NIH have also provided arguments suggesting that fungal prions could be considered a diseased state. There is mounting evidence that fungal proteins have evolved specific functions that are beneficial to the microorganism that enhance their ability to adapt to their diverse environments.|$|E
500|$|Many {{plants have}} {{developed}} effective defences against termites. However, seedlings {{are vulnerable to}} termite attacks and need additional protection, as their defence mechanisms only develop when they have passed the seedling stage. Defence is typically achieved by secreting antifeedant chemicals into the woody cell walls. This reduces the ability of termites to efficiently digest the cellulose. A commercial product, [...] "Blockaid", has been developed in Australia that uses a range of plant extracts to create a paint-on <b>nontoxic</b> termite barrier for buildings. An extract of a species of Australian figwort, Eremophila, {{has been shown to}} repel termites; tests have shown that termites are strongly repelled by the toxic material {{to the extent that they}} will starve rather than consume the food. When kept close to the extract, they become disoriented and eventually die.|$|E
