As theatrical performances were banned on Sundays at this time, it also made Brookwood a popular choice for the burial of actors for the same reason, to the extent that actors were provided with a dedicated section of the cemetery near the station entrance.|$|E
5|$|Saggers {{started the}} tour as the clear second-choice wicket-keeper, as Don Tallon {{had played in}} each of Australia's 11 Tests since the {{resumption}} of cricket after the Second World War, while Saggers was yet to make his Test debut. Saggers made his first-class debut shortly {{before the start of}} the war, and after the resumption, was regarded as the second in line for Test selection behind Tallon. However, as Australia did not make any substantial tours in the years immediately after the end of hostilities, there was no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> reserve gloveman on such trips. However, the trip to England meant more than six months abroad, so a back-up wicketkeeper was needed, and Saggers was selected for his first national squad.|$|E
5|$|This {{efficient}} long-distance travelling {{underlies the}} albatross's {{success as a}} long-distance forager, covering great distances and expending little energy looking for patchily distributed food sources. Their adaptation to gliding flight makes them dependent on wind and waves, however, as their long wings are ill-suited to powered flight and most species lack the muscles and energy to undertake sustained flapping flight. Albatrosses in calm seas are forced {{to rest on the}} ocean's surface until the wind picks up again. The North Pacific albatrosses can use a flight style known as flap-gliding, where the bird progresses by bursts of flapping followed by gliding. When taking off, albatrosses <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> run up to allow enough air to move under the wing to provide lift.|$|E

25|$|In {{coherent}} sheaf theory, {{pushing to}} the limit {{of what could be}} done with Serre duality without the assumption of a non-singular scheme, the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> whole complex of sheaves in place of a single dualizing sheaf became apparent. In fact the Cohen–Macaulay ring condition, a weakening of non-singularity, corresponds to the existence of a single dualizing sheaf; and this is far from the general case. From the top-down intellectual position, always assumed by Grothendieck, this signified a need to reformulate. With it came the idea that the 'real' tensor product and Hom functors would be those existing on the derived level; with respect to those, Tor and Ext become more like computational devices.|$|E
25|$|Lawry {{declared}} in the Fifth Test with Rod Marsh within eight runs of a maiden Test century after the hosts batted first and reached 9/493, the captain making 56 himself. Australia {{continued to play}} defensively, and after making 42 in the second innings, the skipper declared and set the tourists 271 {{in less than a}} day, and the matched petered into a draw with Australia still behind in the series. Another draw in the Sixth Test meant that Australia needed a win to draw the series and retain the Ashes. After taking a 235-run first innings lead, England did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> risk with their series lead with a bold declaration and set Australia a world-record 469 runs for victory. The hosts were 3/328 when time ran out, and Lawry made only 10 and 21. Lawry had batted for more than 24 hours in the series, averaging around 13 runs an hour.|$|E

500|$|Historians have {{advanced}} various views as to why, even though Müller was {{generally regarded as}} the superior scholar, he lost to Williams. Beckerlegge suggests several possible factors: unlike Williams, Müller {{was known as a}} writer and translator rather than a teacher of Sanskrit, he did not have links to the East India Company or the Indian Civil Service that he could call upon for supporters, and he had not been educated at Oxford. In his obituary of Müller, Arthur Macdonell (Boden professor 1899–1926) said that the election [...] "came to turn on the political and religious opinions of the candidates rather than on their merits as Sanskrit scholars", adding that [...] "party feeling ran high and large numbers came up to vote." [...] Similarly, Dowling has written that [...] "in the less cosmopolitan precincts outside Oxford... the argument that Müller was 'not English' told heavily against him" [...] since [...] "the argument was (and was meant to be, of course) unanswerable." [...] She adds that Tories opposed him for his liberal political views, traditionalist factions within Oxford rejected [...] "Germanizing" [...] reform, and [...] "the Anglican clergy... detected unbelief lurking in his umlaut". The American historian Marjorie Wheeler-Barclay takes the view that the three motives for people voting against Müller cannot be disentangled. Those who supported Indian missionary work, Dowling writes, saw it as the key to continued British rule, and there was no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> chance by electing Müller, who had [...] "a reputation for unsound religious opinions", since Williams was a scholar [...] "of distinction known for his conservatism and piety." ...|$|E
500|$|The London Necropolis Company offered {{three classes}} of funerals. A first class funeral allowed the person buying the funeral {{to select the}} grave site of their choice {{anywhere}} in the cemetery; {{at the time of}} opening, first class prices began at £210s (about £ in [...] terms) for a basic [...] plot with no special coffin specifications. It was expected by the LNC that those using first class graves would erect a permanent memorial of some kind in due course following the funeral. Second class funerals cost £1 (about £ in [...] terms) and allowed some control over the burial location. The right to erect a permanent memorial cost an additional 10 shillings (about £ in [...] terms); if a permanent memorial was not erected the LNC reserved the right to re-use the grave in future. Third class funerals were reserved for pauper funerals; those buried at parish expense in the section of the cemetery designated for that parish. Although the LNC was forbidden from using mass graves (other than the burial of next of kin in the same grave) and thus even the lowest class of funeral provided a separate grave for the deceased, third class funerals were not granted the right to erect a permanent memorial on the site. (The families of those buried could pay afterwards to upgrade a third class grave to a higher class if they later wanted to erect a memorial, but this practice was rare.) Despite this, Brookwood's pauper graves granted more dignity to the deceased than did other graveyards and cemeteries of the period, all of which other than Brookwood continued the practice of mass graves for the poor. Brookwood {{was one of the few}} cemeteries to permit burials on Sundays, which made it a popular choice with the poor as it allowed people to attend funerals without the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> day off work.
