500|$|Freedom and responsibility, {{individuality}} and society, {{and love and}} death are among the binaries the symbolic work abounds in.

500|$|In a guest {{column for}} The New York Times, author Erica Jong called Koen's work a [...] "well-researched, workmanlike {{historical}} novel [...] {{of the sort}} that Kathleen Winsor or Thomas B. Costain used to write: packed with details of costume, architecture and cuisine, populated by rudimentary paper-doll characters, full of undigested Continued on <b>next</b> <b>page</b> gobbets of research." [...] Jong shone a negative light on some of the characters, which she believed [...] "seem derived from movies, mini-series and other books" [...] and overshadowed by the attention to historical detail. She concluded that [...] "Koen's publishers [...] her a disservice in presenting this rather routine and turgid book as though it were Gone With the Wind," [...] when it was actually a [...] "well-researched bodice-ripper." ...|$|E
500|$|Nel {{notes that}} Geisel makes heavy use of anapestic tetrameter in Mulberry Street {{and many of}} his later books, citing the rhythm and draw of the books' {{language}} as a main reason for their appeal. Thomas Fensch also notes the rollicking rhythm of the verse in Mulberry Street and Geisel's other books, writing, [...] "Children can read the lines; they can sing the lines; they can SHOUT! the lines; they can dance to the lines." [...] Fensch marks Mulberry Street as the start of what he calls [...] "escalating sequences or escalating action", a technique Geisel used in most of his books, in which the action builds with each page. As Fensch put it, [...] "The rhythm gallopsthe pictures move from left to right, toward the <b>next</b> <b>page</b> and the action builds." ...|$|E

500|$|The Economist heralded the book's publication, saying [...] "If {{there is}} no place for Watership Down in children’s bookshops, then children’s {{literature}} is dead." [...] Peter Prescott, senior book reviewer at Newsweek, gave the novel a glowing review: [...] "Adams handles his suspenseful narrative more dextrously than most authors who claim to write adventure novels, but his true achievement lies in the consistent, comprehensible and altogether enchanting civilisation that he has created." [...] Kathleen J. Rothen and Beverly Langston identified the work as one that [...] "subtly speaks to a child", with [...] "engaging characters and fast-paced action [...] make it readable." [...] This echoed Nicholas Tucker's praise for the story's suspense in the New Statesman: [...] "Adams ... has bravely and successfully resurrected the big picaresque adventure story, with moments of such tension that the helplessly involved reader finds himself checking whether things are going to work out all right on the <b>next</b> <b>page</b> before daring to finish the preceding one." ...|$|E
500|$|Read-Only Memory {{published}} Britsoft: An Oral History in 2015 and The Bitmap Brothers: Universe in 2016, {{both about}} {{a golden age}} of British game development. Britsoft: An Oral History {{was designed as a}} companion to the 2014 film From Bedrooms to Billions, which covers the [...] "Britsoft" [...] era of British game development from the late '70s bedroom developer cottage industry to the present-day billion-pound industry. The book uses developer interviews to tell the era's story so as to supplement rather than reproduce the film's narrative. Interviewed developers include coders and designers David Braben, Geoff Crammond, Mel Croucher, Dino Dini, Jon Hare, Archer MacLean, Jeff Minter, Peter Molyneux and David Perry, businessman David Darling, and writers Chris Anderson, Gary Penn, and Julian Rignall. The book's editor and former Edge editor, Alex Wiltshire, divides the title into eight sections: the developers' initial exposure to video games, the first wave as it attempts to sell its software in the early 1980s, the industry that begins to form, the wealth that comes to the industry, the relationship between these developers and a burgeoning games journalism, the transition from home computers to 16-bit hardware, the coalescing of industry and closure of small businesses, and the late 1990s dispersion as these developers left the industry or moved to less prominent roles in the United States. The book is designed to be read linearly and out of order, based on its presentation as anecdotal snippets rather than long text blocks. It also features linked page numbering such that readers can skip directly to the developer's <b>next</b> <b>page.</b> Reviewers described the 422-page volume by its heft, comprehensiveness, and academicism. Eurogamer and The Verge recommended the book for readers interested in the era as well as readers interested in artistic production. Nintendo Life described the book as lavish, lush, and pleasurable. Reviewers lightly criticised the book's lack of signposted introductions to the many characters, and complained of needing to flip to the appendix for explanatory footnotes and captions for the book's personalities and illustrations. Eurogamer considered the book to come as close to a definitive history of British gaming as is feasible, and praised the book's intimate and fun tone on otherwise dry subject matter.|$|E
