Peripheral blood lymphocytes of a chimpanzee convalescent from experimental infection with <b>NANB</b> <b>hepatitis</b> were transformed in vitro by Epstein-Barr virus infection into lymphoblastoid cell lines. Supernatants of the cell cultures were screened by immunofluorescence for antibody activity against the liver tissue of a chimpanzee with <b>NANB</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> Nineteen of the 1402 cultures {{were found to be}} positive for the activity. Ten of these 19 gave cytoplasmic reactions and the remaining 9 gave nuclear reactions in hepatocytes. One culture (48 - 1) stably producing the antibody was further characterized.

Cloning of 48 - 1 was performed by the soft agar method and cloned cell lines stably producing the antibody were obtained. The 48 - 1 antibody reacted with liver biopsy specimens from 12 chimpanzees obtained during the acute or chronic phase of hepatitis caused by five different NANB strains, but not with biopsy specimens from chimpanzees with hepatitis A or B or from normal chimpanzees.

40|$|Chronic {{liver disease}} is an {{important}} health challenge in the world, where hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are the main causes of liver insufficiency. HBV infection is a serious global health problem, with two billion people infected worldwide, and 350 million suffering from chronic HBV infection. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) affects more than 400 million people globally, of whom 75 % are Asians (1). Hepatitis B infection is the 10 th {{leading cause of death}} worldwide, and results in 500, 000 to 1. 2 million deaths per year caused by chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC accounts for 320, 000 deaths per year (2). The prevalence of chronic HBV infection varies geographically, from high (> 8 %), intermediate (2 - 7 %) to low (< 2 %) prevalence (3). In the Middle East, HBV prevalence has altered from high to intermediate or low prevalence, but HBV infection is a problem of public health, and a major cause of mortality and morbidity particularly in developing countries. Most countries in the Middle East region are still in intermediate to high endemicity for HBV infection. Insufficient coverage of HBV vaccination, blood-contaminated equipment sharing between injection drug users, unsafe blood transfusion, and inadequate health precautions are major risk factors of HBV infection in this region. Screening of HBV infection during pregnancy, and follow-up of infants with HBV infected mothers will reduce rates of perinatal HBV infection in these countries. Implementing local strategies for hepatitis B screening will reduce the infection rate (4, 5). The socioeconomic and sanitary changes, expanded program on immunization of infants and all high risk populations have changed the epidemiologic profile of HBV infection in Iran. Universal vaccination significantly decreased the carrier rate among young children. More studies on the impact of vaccine types, environment, ethnicity and other contributing factors that can impede an adequate antibody response in our population is necessary. Educating infection prevention and modes of transmission, especially for groups at risk of hepatitis exposure and limiting immigration from neighboring countries are the most cost-effective ways of infection control (6). The effectiveness of routine infant hepatitis B immunization in significantly reducing or eliminating the prevalence of chronic HBV infection has been demonstrated in a variety of countries and settings. However, there are still many challenges to achieve the goal of universal childhood immunization against hepatitis B, such as poor immunization delivery infrastructure, low coverage and lack of financial sustainability. Therefore, to continue to promote access to hepatitis B vaccines worldwide, great efforts are needed to support countries to ensure sustained funding for immunization programs. Hepatitis C infection is now {{the most common cause of}} end-stage liver disease in many countries (7). It is a blood-borne infection that was a well-known cause of post-transfusion hepatitis after introduction of hepatitis B screening in blood banking and before implementation of hepatitis C-sensitive screening laboratory methods. Since the discovery of HCV and the development of diagnostic tests, almost all of the non-A non-B (<b>NANB)</b> post-transfusion <b>hepatitis</b> cases were shown to be due to HCV infection (2). Recently, HCV infection has drawn great attention due to similar risk factors and coinfectivity with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. World Health Organization (WHO) estimations suggest that up to 3 % of the world's population (170 million) have been infected with HCV. HCV is an emerging disease and we should be more sensitive and more active about the important treat for the young people (8). Networking for overcoming viral hepatitis needs more cooperation between scientists in the region. It's my pleasure to inform you that "Asian Hepatitis Network" (www. hep. ir) reaches thousands of professionals and practioners in hepatitis in the Middle East and Asia. We have developed from a local association in Iran (Iran Hepatitis Network) to an international one in a very short time. We are delighted to be able to share our findings with other researchers and let them share theirs with us. The principle goals of the "Asian Hepatitis Network" are to transform the advances of basic science in virology, pharmacology, pharmaceutical drugs, supporting for advancing and furthering the study researches, education, academic exchanges of knowledge in the profession of hepatology, managing principles of clinical research and basic sciences in the field of hepatology, integrating national and international projects to develop all important aspects of hepatology, facilitating coalition activities among members by circulating information on research through scientific conferences and workshops, providing global facilities, avoiding parallel works and practicing for team work, and planning for a database to register scientists, projects and laboratories engaged in activities in the field of hepatology. "Asian Hepatitis Network" is a virtual network on hepatitis in the Middle East and Asia. This is a coalition of independent member research centers and groups that serve the interests of scientists in the field of hepatology in the Middle East and Asia. This network was first approved and organized by Baqiyatallah Research Center for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases (BRCGL) and Tehran Hepatitis Center (THC) and after that by Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran and its deputies for health and research & technology and nine research centers in Iran. This network has a scientific research journal for all Asian scientists in the field of hepatology; "Hepatitis Monthly" (www. HepMon. com). "Hepatitis Monthly" is an internationally recognized scientific research journal which serves as a forum for exchange of scientific information in the field of liver diseases with special attention to hepatitis. Through years of successful publication, "Hepatitis Monthly" has gained a lot of reputation among clinicians for the education and information it provided them with. The specialists that can be involved in our network consist of hepatologists, internists, infectious specialists, pediatricians, family physicians and general practitioners, virologists, pharmacists, nurses, etc. This Journal is now indexed in Elsevier Bibliographic Database, SCOPUS, EMBASE, Index Copernicus, DOAJ, HighWire Press, Cochrane, WHO-EMRO Index Medicus, and CABI.

Initial investigations were conducted with a model system of hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigens for purposes of comparing two immunocytochemical staining methods. Of these two procedures, an immunoperoxidase procedure, utilizing an avidin-biotinylated enzyme complex, was at least 40 -fold more sensitive than a conventional immunoperoxidase technique for the detection of HBV-specific tissue antigens.

40|$|The entity {{of chronic}} {{hepatitis}} {{has long been}} an enigma, and its treatment confusing. Recent studies have indicated the importance of excluding causes such as drugs, Wilson’s disease and α 1 -antitrypsin deficiency. After excluding such causes, there are 3 major groups — ‘autoimmune’, hepatitis B, and non-A, non-B (NANB) in all of which an immunological basis for pathogenesis exists. The autoimmune group has been subdivided into a milder type (chronic persistent hepatitis) and a more severe type (chronic active hepatitis) on histological grounds. Corticosteroids are indicated in chronic active hepatitis if cirrhosis or bridging necrosis is present. However, corticosteroids are contraindicated in disease due to the hepatitis B virus where chronic active hepatitis correlates with the presence of replicating virus (serum positive for e antigen, DNA polymerase and HBV-DNA), and in such cases antiviral agents and immunomodulation are being studied. Very little is known about <b>NANB</b> <b>hepatitis</b> {{in the absence of an}} assay and there may be more than a single agent. In hepatitis B, the development of serological markers, molecular probes (HBV-DNA), natural animal hepatitis with near-identical viruses, and δ antigen (a virus requiring coinfection with hepatitis B) have all extended our knowledge so dramatically that it is hoped that the enigma of chronic hepatitis will be solved when an assay for <b>NANB</b> <b>hepatitis</b> becomes available...|$|E
40|$|In an {{anonymous}} survey, 433 sera from Canadian individuals of selected categories were {{tested for the}} presence of antibody to hepatitis C virus (HCV) using a recombinant antigen-based immunoassay. About 50 % of intravenous drug abusers (IVDA), 10 % of transfusion recipients and an overall average of 7. 9 % of male homosexuals were reactive for antibody to HCV. Individuals with jaundice and negative hepatitis B virus (HBV) serology were not reactive for antibody to HCV compared with 26. 7 % of those with positive HBV serology. Similarly 58 % of male Federal prisoners with positive HBV serology were also HCV-antibody reactive compared with 15 % of those with negative HBV serology. A prevalence of 1. 2 % was recorded for individuals not in any of the above groups. Of 433 sera, 92 were reactive and the discrimination in absorbance values between reactive and not reactive samples was good except for 13 sera, eight of which gave values considerably higher than the average negative value and five which were just above the positive threshold. Non-A, non-B (<b>NANB)</b> <b>hepatitis</b> has been recognized as a clinically separate entity 1 from hepatitis A and B, for which specific serological tests have been available for at least 15 years. 2 Two types of <b>NANB</b> <b>hepatitis</b> have been identified based on epidemiological data...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} PG on {{patients}} with fulminant and subfulminant viral hepatitis (FHF) was studied. 17 patients presented with FHF secondary to hepatitis A (n = 3), hepatitis B (n = 6), and non-A, non-B (<b>NANB)</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (n = 8). 14 of the 17 patients had stage III or IV hepatic encephalopathy (HE). At presentation the mean aspartate transaminase (AST) was 1, 844 +/- 1, 246 U/liter, bilirubin 232 +/- 135 mumol/liter, prothrombin time (PT) 34 +/- 18, {{partial thromboplastin time}} (PTT) 73 +/- 26 s, and coagulation Factors V and VII 8 +/- 4 and 9 +/- 5 %, respectively. Intravenous PGE 1 was initiated 24 - 48 h later after a rise in AST (2, 195 +/- 1, 810), bilirubin (341 +/- 148), PT (36 +/- 15), and PTT (75 +/- 18). 12 of 17 responded rapidly with a decrease in AST from 1, 540 +/- 833 to 188 +/- 324 U/liter. Improvement in hepatic synthetic function was indicated by a decrease in PT from 27 +/- 7 to 12 +/- 1 s and PTT from 61 +/- 10 to 31 +/- 2 s, {{and an increase in}} Factor V from 9 +/- 4 to 69 +/- 18 % and Factor VII from 11 +/- 5 to 71 +/- 20 %. Five responders with <b>NANB</b> <b>hepatitis</b> relapsed upon discontinuation of therapy, with recurrence of HE and increases in AST and PT, and improvement was observed upon retreatment. After 4 wk of intravenous therapy oral PGE 2 was substituted. Two patients with <b>NANB</b> <b>hepatitis</b> recovered completely and remained in remission 6 and 12 mo after cessation of therapy. Two additional patients continued in remission after 2 and 6 mo of PGE 2. No relapses were seen in the patients with hepatitis A virus and hepatitis B virus infection. Liver biopsies in all 12 surviving patients returned to normal. In the five nonresponders an improvement in hepatic function was indicated by a fall in AST (3, 767 +/- 2, 611 to 2, 142 +/- 2, 040 U/liter), PT (52 +/- 25 to 33 +/- 18 s), and PTT (103 +/- 29 to 77 +/- 44 s), but all deteriorated and died of cerebral edema (n = 3) or underwent liver transplantation (n = 2).

A close antigenic relationship has been shown between the cytoplasmic alterations observed in NANB and delta hepatitis in chimpanzees.

40|$|Fecal and serum {{samples from}} a {{chimpanzee}} with acute-phase, blood-borne non-A, non-B hepatitis {{were administered to}} four chimpanzees. Fecal material given either in-travenously or orally {{did not result in}} abnormal levels of alanine aminotransferase or the occurrence of ultrastructural alterations in hepatocellular cytoplasm characteristic of non-A, non-B hepatitis during a one-year period of follow-up. Definite non-A, non-B hepatitis was later demonstrated in two of these animals four weeks after inoculation of acute-phase serum. Thus, feces do not appear to transmit this human strain of blood-borne non-A, non-B hepatitis. The epidemiology of blood-borne non-A, non-B (<b>NANB)</b> <b>hepatitis</b> seen in Europe and North America appears similar to that of hepatitis B, al-though definitive studies await an immunologic assay.

40|$|Two {{separate}} and distinct episodes of non-At non-B hepatitis were induced in each of two chimpanzees by two inocula: one containing a chloroform-resistant agent and the other containing a chloroform-sensitive agent. Both agents were recovered from liver tissue and plasma obtained from a single chimpanzee during the acute and chronic phases of infection with a factor VIII concentrate, respectively. The chloroform-resis-tant agent did not cause unique changes in hepatocytes; in contrast, the chloroform-sensitive agent did induce the formation of cytoplasmic tubules, convoluted endoplas-mic reticulum, and dense reticular inclusion bodies. The latter changes are similar in character to those induced in infected cells by some enveloped mammalian RNA viruses.

40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV), an enveloped {{positive}} stranded RNA virus, is the causative {{agent of}} non-A, non-B (<b>NANB)</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (27). The virus was identified and characterized by molecular cloning techniques using serum from a <b>NANB</b> <b>hepatitis</b> virus infected chimpanzee (15) {{and based on}} the similarity of the genome organization and hydropathy profiles of several precursor proteins classified {{as a member of the}} Flaviviridae family. However, the low sequence homology compared to other flaviviruses eventually lead to its classification into a new genus hepacivirus, distinct from the other flavivirus members (33, 74). Initial studies demonstrated that blood transfusions were the main transmission route that caused the HCV epidemic, especially prior to the period of HCV-contaminated blood screening in 1992 (50). HCV high-risk groups include recipients of multiple blood transfusion, hemophiliacs, hemodialysis patients and intravenous drug users. Modes of transmission include contact with contaminated-blood products, sharing needles, mother-to-child and sexual transmissions (69). Infection of the human liver is often clinically benign, with mild symptoms in the acute phase and fulminant hepatitis is very rare. The disease may even go unnoticed in cases of acute resolving HCV. In most cases (> 70 %) HCV infection leads to chronic persistent or active infection, often accompanied by complications of liver cirrhosis, or type II cryoglobulinaemia. The mechanisms of HCV persistence are not fully understood but the inability of the host innate and specific immune system to clear the virus is remarkable for a positive stranded RNA virus. HCV specific CD 8 + T-cell responses are considered to play an important role in the containment and clearance of HCV infection but few of these cells are present in the liver and are unable to eradicate the infection. In addition, antibodies to HCV do not seem to play a major role in clearance of infection and re-infections are often observed with a different HCV strain, suggesting that immune responses to the initial strain did not protect against an infection with another strain of HCV (43) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Ten {{years after}} the {{discovery}} of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and its association with <b>NANB</b> <b>hepatitis</b> as a major cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, our knowledge of the natural history of hepatitis C is still limited. The asymptomatic course of the disease in most patients, its slow and silent progression and heterogeneous outcome and the widespread use of interferon therapy during the past decade explain why many questions are still unsolved. The changing epidemiological pattern of HCV and the significant contribution of several cofactors to the severity of liver disease also complicate the development of a general model describing the natural history of hepatitis C. Available data indicate that HCV infection may resolve without any clinical signs of liver disease in individuals exposed to low dose inoculum and that these cases may develop T cell immunity {{even in the absence of}} anti-HCV seroconversion. Rates of complete biochemical and virological resolution of acute hepatitis C range between 10 and 50...|$|E
40|$|Enterovirus-like {{particles}} {{have been}} reported in the acute phase of both epidemic and sporadic non-A, non-B (<b>NANB)</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> To examine whether these particles were the causative agent in the two types of disease, 29 patients with acute viral hepatitis in a north Indian epidemic outbreak and 9 with sporadic acute disease were investigated. 25 (86 %) of 29 patients with epidemic hepatitis and 5 (56 %) of 9 with sporadic disease were diagnosed as having enterically-transmitted-NANB hepatitis by exclusion. Virus-like particles (VLP) of 30 - 34 nm were detected in stool of 1 patient with epidemic and 1 with sporadic hepatitis. The VLPs crossreacted serologically and a specific IgM response was seen in acute epidemic and sporadic serum samples. After inoculation with infected stool rhesus monkeys had a mild rise in liver enzymes, and bile samples contained VLPs. These results suggest that the aetiological agent in epidemic and sporadic disease is the same...|$|E
40|$|Twelve serologically proven {{cases of}} non-A, non-B (<b>NANB)</b> <b>hepatitis</b> have been described. The {{clinical}} course was mild in 11 patients. One patient, however, presented in portal systemic encephalopathy and required steroid treatment. Nine of the 12 patients continued to exhibit raised transaminase (AST) activities {{six or more}} months after {{the onset of the}} acute hepatitis. In these immunoglobulin concentrations were normal and autoantibodies were not present in significant titre. Four patients had evidence of previous hepatitis B infection, suggesting that the route of transmission of NANB might be similar to that of hepatitis B virus. A further four patients gave a history which suggests a possible parenteral mode of transmission. Liver biopsies were carried out both in the acute (8 cases) and chronic (6 cases) phases of the disease. Histological findings in liver biopsies covered the whole spectrum of acute and chronic hepatitis and 1 patient had cirrhosis. One notable feature in these biopsies was the presence of fatty changes...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis C {{virus has}} been proven to be the major cause of <b>NANB</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> {{cirrhosis}} and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Based on the genome similarities between HCV and flavivirus or pestivirus, this agent has been included within the family Flaviviridae as a separate genus. Among the analogies between HCV {{and the other members}} of the same family there is the possibility of infecting blood cells. In particular, significant evidence obtained through studies performed in vivo and in vitro support the concept that HCV is not only a hepatotropic but also a lymphotropic virus. This suggests that, in addition to playing a role in inducing hepatic diseases (both of a non-tumoral and a neoplastic nature), HCV infection may also play a role in extrahepatic pathologies. The striking association observed between HCV infection and some autoimmune-lymphoproliferative disorders of either benign or neoplastic nature is consistent with this hypothesis. However, in analogy with what has been observed in the case of liver disease, the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of HCV-related extra-hepatic manifestations have to be more deeply analysed and clarifie...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in 32 chronic HBsAg carriers {{was performed by}} spot hybridization technique using both biotinylated and radiolabeled probes, in order to compare their specificity and sensitivity. Our results show that both assays are specific since neither evidence of cross-hybridization between HBV DNA and sera from patients with chronic non-A, non-B (<b>NANB)</b> <b>hepatitis</b> was found, nor HBV DNA was detected both in patients with chronic anti-HBs/anti-HBc-positive hepatitis and in patients negative for all HBV markers. An agreement between the two assays was observed in 94 % of the tested sera. Even though in 5 serum samples (6 %) low levels of HBV DNA (0. 1 - 1 pg/ 100 microliter) remained undetected using the biotin-labeled probe, the lower detection limit of the two assays (0. 1 pg of HBV DNA) was the same using purified Dane particles as control. This study indicates that the enzymatic {{detection of}} HBV DNA is suitable for routine and rapid monitoring of HBV replication in both HBeAg- and anti-HBe-positive patients, {{as well as for}} a semiquantitative analysis of serum HBV DNA...|$|E
