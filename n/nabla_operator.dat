3000|$|Due {{to their}} {{successful}} applications in many branches {{of science and}} engineering, techniques of fractional calculus have been under focus by many researchers {{in the past and}} in the present decades [1 – 10]. The theory of fractional sums with delta operator and the fractional differences with <b>nabla</b> <b>operators</b> were firstly introduced in [11]. Extensive development of the theory can be found in [12 – 31]. The monotonicity properties of delta and <b>nabla</b> fractional <b>operators</b> were studied in [32 – 36]. It is worth mentioning that Atıcı et al. in [34] studied the monotonicity properties of delta fractional differences and obtained a delta-fractional difference version of the mean-value theorem. In [37], interesting monotonicity results were provided using the dual identities related to delta and <b>nabla</b> fractional <b>operators.</b> In [38], the authors studied the relationship between the discrete sequential fractional operators and monotonicity. Recently, in [39 – 45], fractional operators with Mittag–Leffler and exponential “non-singular” kernels have been studied together with their discrete versions, and the monotonicity has been investigated. Motivated by all the above-mentioned works, we prove interesting monotonicity results with mean value theorem as an application in this paper for nabla fractional differences in the time scale h Z, 0 < h ≤ 1 [...] (called h-nabla fractional differences), which is considered as a generalized form of the monotonicity results when h= 1. Also, working on hZ, 0 < h< 1 guarantees more accurate approximations for the solutions of fractional dynamical systems.|$|R

5000|$|A key {{concept in}} the {{dynamics}} of vortices is the vorticity, a vector that describes the local rotary motion {{at a point in}} the fluid, as would be perceived by an observer that moves along with it. Conceptually, the vorticity could be observed by placing a tiny rough ball at the point in question, free to move with the fluid, and observing how it rotates about its center. The direction of the vorticity vector is defined to be the direction of the axis of rotation of this imaginary ball (according to the right-hand rule) while its length is twice the ball's angular velocity. Mathematically, the vorticity is defined as the curl (or rotational) of the velocity field of the fluid, usually denoted by [...] and expressed by the vector analysis formula , where [...] is the <b>nabla</b> <b>operator</b> and [...] is the local flow velocity.|$|E
30|$|The {{article is}} {{organized}} as follows. The remaining {{part of this}} section contains summary {{to some of the}} basic notations and definitions in delta and nabla calculus. Section  2 contains the definitions in the frame of delta and nabla fractional sums and differences in the Riemann sense. Moreover, some essential lemmas about the commutativity of the different fractional sum operators with the usual difference operators are established. These lemmas are vital to proceeding in the next sections. The third section contains some dual identities relating nabla and delta fractional sums and differences in the left and right cases. Using these dual identities, power formulas for nabla left and right fractional sums and a commutative law for nabla left and right sums are obtained. In Section  4 the integration by parts formula for nabla fractional sums and differences obtained in [20] is used by the help of the dual identities to obtain delta integration by parts formulas. Section  5 is devoted to higher-order initial fractional difference value problems into Riemann. Finally, in Section  6 the Q-operator is used to relate left and right fractional sums in nabla and delta case and hence relates delta and nabla Riemann fractional differences. The Q-dual identities obtained in this section expose the validity of the definition of delta and nabla right fractional differences where delta and <b>nabla</b> <b>operators</b> are used in each of the definitions of delta and nabla right fractional differences.|$|R
30|$|There is {{a second}} {{important}} point worth making regarding Definitions 1.8 - 1.9 as compared to Definitions 1.3 - 1.4. Notice that the fractional nabla sum and difference do not induce a domain shift {{in the way that}} the fractional delta sum and difference induce. Practically this means that if f is defined on N_a, then so, too, is the map t∇_a^-μf(t). Thus, at least in this one sense, <b>nabla</b> fractional <b>operators</b> are somewhat easier to work with than their delta counterparts. As we go through the remainder of this survey we shall see some additional dissimilarities between these two operators, particularly as concerns their relationship to monotonicity and convexity.|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} Caputo type <b>nabla</b> (q,h)-fractional difference <b>operators</b> and investigate their basic properties. Here, we solve some linear fractional difference equations involving Caputo type (q,h)-derivatives and provide the general solutions in terms of discrete Mittag-Leffler functions introduced in [25]. In addition, we also apply the (q,h)-Laplace transform method (introduced in [28]) to solve these linear fractional order difference equations.|$|R
30|$|In great contrast, {{we see in}} Theorem  2.13 that in the nabla {{setting the}} {{imposition}} of the condition ∇_a^νf(t)> 0, for t∈N_a+ 1, is sufficient that f is increasing on N_a+ 2. Thus, the <b>nabla</b> <b>operator</b> behaves differently in this case. And, in fact, the <b>nabla</b> <b>operator</b> behaves more naturally insofar Theorem  2.13 is a more natural analog of Proposition  2.1 than are the results in the delta difference setting.|$|E
