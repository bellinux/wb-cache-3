In 2001, Pescarolo Sport began using a 3.2-litre twin-turbocharged Sodemo-Peugeot A32 V6 engined version of the car, and the Peugeot-engined versions {{would prove to be}} the most successful. In 2004, Pescarolo redeveloped the C60 on their own, and replaced the Peugeot engines with 5-litre Judd GV5 V10s. In 2005, Courage ran two updated versions of the C60 (known as the C60 Hybrid, and using the Judd GV4 engines) as a factory effort, and one of these took third place at that year's 24 Hours of Le Mans; Pescarolo also updated their C60s into a similar Hybrid format, and took second at the 2005 and 2006 24 Hours of Le Mans, whilst also winning the Le Mans Series in both years.|$|E

25|$|The petrol models {{initially}} {{used the}} 4-cylinder N13, 4-cylinder N20 and 6-cylinder N55 engines, {{which are all}} turbocharged. This meant that the 325i and 328i models (traditionally powered by <b>naturally-aspirated</b> 6-cylinder engines) now used the turbocharged 4-cylinder N20 engine. For the 2016 facelift (LCI), the engines were updated to the 3-cylinder B38, the 4-cylinder B48 and the 6-cylinder B58.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Courage Compétition {{introduced}} the C60 as a clean-sheet {{replacement for the}} Courage C52. Like its predecessor, the C60 was designed by Paolo Catone, {{and was the first}} all-new car since the Courage C41 was introduced. The C60 used a carbon fibre and aluminium honeycomb monocoque chassis, whilst its suspension consisted of double wishbones, pushrods and horizontally-located dynamic dampers. SMG Compétition were the first team to run the car, and their C60 was fitted with a 4-litre <b>naturally-aspirated</b> Judd GV4 V10 engine, In 2001, Pescarolo Sport began using the C60 and their C60s used a Sodemo-developed 3.2-litre twin-turbocharged Peugeot A32 V6 engine, capable of a claimed power output of [...] In 2002, André de Cortanze redeveloped the C60 into the C60 Evo, which notably featured an unusual brake duct system similar to that found on an open-wheel racing car {{at the front of the}} car, whilst the rear wing endplates were redesigned and the Peugeot A32 engine now produced a claimed output of [...] The endplates were further developed in 2003, whilst the engine's air restrictors were decreased in size from , resulting in the claimed power output decreasing to [...] In 2004, Pescarolo began running the car as a [...] "Pescarolo C60" [...] with a 5-litre Judd GV5 V10 engine, as Henri Pescarolo had further developed the C60. For 2005, Courage and Pescarolo both released redeveloped versions of the C60 for the new LMP1 regulations; both were designated as C60 Hybrids and used Judd engines. The Pescarolo version retained its Judd GV5 engine, with a claimed power output of , whilst the Courage version used the smaller [...] Judd GV4 engine, and featured a noticeably different rear wing. Courage {{introduced the}} new Catone-designed Courage LC70 in 2006 as the C60's replacement.|$|E

2500|$|The engine (parts code: 07L, {{identification}} code: BUH) of the RS6 {{was what}} Audi {{claimed to be}} the first all-aluminium alloy even firing 5.0-litre (...) 90° V10 twin-turbocharged ("biturbo"), Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI), with a dry sump lubrication system. This engine is related to the <b>naturally-aspirated</b> V10 found in the Audi R8, S6 and S8, and the Lamborghini Gallardo, but the RS 6's engine has around 400 unique parts.|$|E
2500|$|The A410 had {{a carbon}} fibre {{monocoque}} chassis, with double wishbone suspension, with push-rod actuated coil springs and dampers {{at both ends}} of the car.

Although the power output was similar to that of the most successful LMP900 car, the Audi R8, the naturally aspirated engine produced far less torque than the 3.6-litre, twin-turbocharged V8 engine in the R8; around [...] less. The A410 used a 6-speed sequential gearbox, driving the rear wheels, and featured carbon fibre disc brakes, as was standard within the class.|$|E
2500|$|The Chevron B31 was an {{evolution}} of the B26, and was designed for the European 2-Litre Championship by Chevron Cars Ltd's founder Derek Bennett in 1975; six cars were built. The B31 featured subtle changes, such as a slightly redesigned bodywork, but it featured the same basic aluminium monocoque chassis as its predecessor. The bodywork was made from fiberglass, and the B31 was designed {{to use the same}} Hart 420R engine as its predecessor had. The 420R was a <b>naturally-aspirated</b> 2-litre, 16 valve DOHC fuel-injected straight-four engine, with a maximum power output of [...] at 9500 rpm, and the power was transmitted to the rear wheels by a Hewland 5-speed manual transmission.|$|E

50|$|The vacuum can be {{generated}} in two distinct methods, dependent {{on the type of}} internal combustion engine, or other motive force (as in electric vehicles). In <b>naturally-aspirated</b> petrol engines, the manifold vacuum is used, whereas in turbo charged, diesel engines, and electric/hybrid vehicles a separate vacuum pump is used (or in certain high altitude places, <b>naturally-aspirated</b> vehicles are not capable of producing enough vacuum for the booster. The vacuum pump can be driven mechanically (from the engine) or by means of an electric motor. The vacuum is transferred to the servo along non-collapsible vacuum lines, and is stored in the servo by using a non-return valve.|$|E
