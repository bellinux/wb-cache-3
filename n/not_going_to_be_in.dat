A story goes that tackle Bill Fincher sought to knock Centre quarterback [...] "Bo" [...] McMillin out of the game, taking with him brass-knuckles or [...] "something equally diabolical." [...] Before the game, Fincher said [...] "You're a great player Bo...I feel awful sorry about it because you are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> there very longabout three minutes." ...|$|E

[...] "Now, it looks like a great idea," [...] Stevens later remarked. [...] "At the time, I thought it was something I really wanted to try."

2500|$|The last of McManaman's caps came in 2001 when Sven-Göran Eriksson {{utilised}} him for {{his first}} games in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, including a game back at Anfield against Finland – where McManaman set up David Beckham's winner– but then apparently {{left a message on}} McManaman's answering machine to inform him that he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the final World Cup squad in early 2002. Despite the pleas of McManaman's Real Madrid team mates Zidane and Fernando Hierro for McManaman's case, McManaman said he never ever heard from or met Eriksson again. Zidane went on to state England had made a mistake, and described McManaman with a rare passion as one of the highest quality players he ever played with: [...] "I was surprised when McManaman was left out of the last England squad. I couldn't believe they would ignore a player of his quality. Now people are {{talking about the fact that}} maybe he will get his chance because David Beckham is injured. But McManaman is far better than just being a replacement for Beckham. McManaman should be in the starting line-up anyway." [...] Support for McManaman also came before the 2002 World Cup in the British media, after Sky Sports published an article based on OPTA statistics, revealing that despite a poor goalscoring record, McManaman had in fact an 88% dribbling completion rate (having embarked on a run every 17 minutes), and an 84% pass completion rate, all three of which were higher by over 15% than any English midfield Premiership player at the time.|$|E

First, Lee, who may have been the biggest star in the world at the time the film was to be shot, was now <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the film. Second, upon hearing of Lee's death, Chiba refused to sign his {{contract}} for the film and promptly flew back to Japan. Third, Lee's death brought terrible press, especially since the film's other star Lazenby was supposed to have dinner with Lee the very night he died. Fourth, Warner Brothers then dropped out and the film lost its large worldwide theatrical distribution. And finally, because of all of this Raymond Chow cut the film's production budget from $10,000,000 to $850,000 and severely cut the marketing budget to cover the film's new small theatrical release. Although this was still an enormous production budget for a Hong Kong-based film at that time, and actually matched Enter the Dragon as the most expensive martial arts film of all time at that point, the huge cut in marketing and loss of worldwide distribution greatly hurt the film's box office.|$|E
