5|$|During {{most of his}} {{own life}} {{conservationism}} wasn't yet on the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views—except in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild <b>nature</b> <b>was</b> left in the industrialized world.|$|E
5|$|In later {{editions of}} the book, Darwin traced {{evolutionary}} ideas {{as far back as}} Aristotle; the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles. Early Christian Church Fathers and Medieval European scholars interpreted the Genesis creation narrative allegorically rather than as a literal historical account; organisms were described by their mythological and heraldic significance as well as by their physical form. <b>Nature</b> <b>was</b> widely believed to be unstable and capricious, with monstrous births from union between species, and spontaneous generation of life.|$|E

5|$|The Eta Carinae {{star system}} is {{currently}} {{one of the}} most massive that can be studied in great detail. Until recently Eta Carinae was thought to be the most massive single star, but the system's binary <b>nature</b> <b>was</b> proposed by the Brazilian astronomer Augusto Damineli in 1996 and confirmed in 2005. Both component stars are largely obscured by circumstellar material ejected from Eta Carinae A and basic properties such as their temperatures and luminosities can only be inferred. Rapid changes to the stellar wind in the 21st century suggest that the star itself may be revealed as dust from the great eruption finally clears.|$|E

30|$|In summary, {{from the}} {{perspective}} of natural philosophy, Baconian real-constructivism claims that <b>nature</b> <b>is</b> <b>nature</b> insofar as it is governed by laws; <b>nature</b> <b>is</b> nothing but mathematical law. On the other hand, there is a type of <b>nature</b> that <b>is</b> phenomenologically given. Technological artifacts and technical systems are not unnatural or beyond nature; they are also, and in particular, natural reality insofar as they are constructed. Furthermore, production <b>is</b> apparent in <b>nature</b> itself: <b>Nature</b> <b>is</b> capable of constructing something.|$|R

5|$|After {{the end of}} {{his major}} league career, Martin {{returned}} to the minor leagues, serving as a player-manager with the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League in 1945 and 1946 before becoming the player-manager for the Greenville Spinners of the South Atlantic League in 1947. His fiery, competitive <b>nature</b> <b>was</b> still evident in July 1945 when it was reported that he had punched one of his players for not performing to his standards. While managing the Miami Sun Sox of the Florida International League in 1949, he was fined and suspended {{for the remainder of the}} season for choking an umpire. In August 1951, he made news again when he was arrested after a Sun Sox game when he went into the stands to punch a spectator in Lakeland, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Although too old {{to serve}} in the military, Blackburn {{supported}} the Confederate cause during the Civil War. In {{the early days of the}} war, he acted as a civilian agent for the governments of Kentucky and Mississippi. By 1863, he was aiding Confederate blockade runners in Canada. In 1864, he traveled to Bermuda to help combat a yellow fever outbreak that threatened Confederate blockade running operations there. Shortly after the war's end, a Confederate double agent accused him of having carried out a plot to start a yellow fever epidemic in the Northern United States that would have hampered the Union war effort. Blackburn was accused of collecting linens and garments used by yellow fever patients and smuggling them into the Northern states to be sold. The evidence against Blackburn was considerable, although much of it was either circumstantial or provided by witnesses of questionable reputation. Although he was acquitted by a Toronto court, public sentiment was decidedly against him throughout much of the United States. Today, historians still disagree as to the strength of the evidence supporting Blackburn's role in the alleged plot. Any plot of this <b>nature</b> <b>was</b> destined to fail, however; in 1900, Walter Reed discovered that yellow fever is spread by mosquitoes, not by contact.|$|E
5|$|Boycott's {{eight seasons}} of {{captaincy}} were among Yorkshire's least successful. The club {{failed to win}} any competitions and ranked low in the Championship table, in contrast to their one-time dominance of English cricket. The {{beginning of the end}} of his captaincy came after BBC Radio Leeds interviews in which two Yorkshire committee members and former players, Don Brennan and Mel Ryan, said that a change in leadership was needed. Boycott himself did not suffer a loss of form to mirror that of his county; in his first year as captain, he scored 2,503runs at an average of 100.12, included a century in his first match as captain. His success was cited by Trueman as evidence that his selfish <b>nature</b> <b>was</b> harming Yorkshire.|$|E
50|$|As {{the central}} {{character}} in the book, <b>nature</b> <b>is</b> personified and deified. It is assigned agency—feelings and intentions—and autonomy from humans.

Accordingly, <b>nature</b> <b>is</b> supreme and has higher purposes independent of humans. The spiritual truths and divine mysteries manifested and reflected in nature supersede any human equivalent.|$|R

In a letter to a friend, Szigeti describes their California life: Wanda is happy, doing wonders with her gardening, chicken and rabbit raising, preserve and pâté de foie making. She doesn't budge from our place, doesn't {{want to come back to}} New York even for a visit, which I, for one, can well understand!

5|$|Due to the BBC's 1970s junking policy, 97 episodes {{from the}} 1960s are missing, {{with the result}} that 26 serials are incomplete, {{although}} all of these still exist as audio recordings, and some have been reconstructed. In the first two seasons and most of the third, each episode of a serial had an individual title; no serial had an overall on-screen title until The Savages. The serial titles given below are the most common title for the serials as a whole, used in sources such as the Doctor Who Reference Guide and the BBC's classic episode guide, and are generally those used for commercial release. The practice of individually titled episodes resurfaced with the show's 2005 revival, when Doctor Whos serial <b>nature</b> <b>was</b> abandoned in favour of an episodic format.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War {{the estate}} {{was used as}} a {{military}} hospital, and in the Second World War was requisitioned by the War Office and used in turn as a transit camp, RAF HQ and US Army Command HQ. The estate was the venue for the 1936 Royal Show. One of the exhibition buildings, despite its temporary <b>nature,</b> <b>was</b> an innovative piece of modernist architecture still remembered as the Gane Pavilion. It was designed by Bauhaus architect Marcel Breuer as a show house for the Bristol furniture manufacturer Crofton Gane.

5|$|Early fossil {{remains were}} fragmentary, {{which led to}} much {{speculation}} on the posture and nature of Iguanodon. Iguanodon was initially portrayed as a quadrupedal horn-nosed beast. However, as more bones were discovered, Mantell observed that the forelimbs were {{much smaller than the}} hindlimbs. His rival Owen was of the opinion it was a stumpy creature with four pillar-like legs. The job of overseeing the first lifesize reconstruction of dinosaurs was initially offered to Mantell, who declined due to poor health, and Owen's vision subsequently formed the basis on which the sculptures took shape. Its bipedal <b>nature</b> <b>was</b> revealed with the discovery of the Bernissart skeletons. However, it was depicted in an upright posture, with the tail dragging along the ground, acting as the third leg of a tripod.|$|E
5|$|England toured Australia in the 1954–55 season. Johnson was {{selected}} to lead an Australian XI in a tour match against the Englishmen before the Tests, {{an indication of the}} selectors' inclination. He took 6/66 in England's only innings. The build-up featured a media war, with Melbourne newspapers stumping for Johnson while the Sydney journalists trumpeted Miller. Miller warmed up for the Tests with 86 for New South Wales against England. On 18 November, the Australian Board of Control selected Johnson as captain, with Morris as his deputy. Miller's irreverent <b>nature</b> <b>was</b> cited as a possible reason for the board's selection. Johnson was regarded as a superior diplomat, while Miller had a reputation for turning up late and being undisciplined. Miller had frequently been in dispute with Bradman, {{who was a member of}} the board and the chairman of selectors. Miller had also questioned where revenue that the board collected from ticket sales was being used. Others claimed that Johnson was appointed because he was part of the establishment; his father Bill was a former Australian selector. The decision was bitterly criticised by the Sydney press.|$|E
5|$|Heyer {{essentially}} {{established the}} historical romance genre and its subgenre Regency romance. Her Regencies {{were inspired by}} Jane Austen, but unlike Austen, who wrote about and for the times in which she lived, Heyer was forced to include copious information about the period so that her readers would understand the setting. To ensure accuracy, Heyer collected reference works and kept detailed notes on all aspects of Regency life. While some critics thought the novels were too detailed, others considered the level of detail to be Heyer's greatest asset. Her meticulous <b>nature</b> <b>was</b> also evident in her historical novels; Heyer even recreated William the Conqueror's crossing into England for her novel The Conqueror.|$|E

5|$|In the {{economic}} fields, he {{was influenced by}} the principles of physiocracy, an economic doctrine that considered that <b>nature</b> <b>was</b> the source of wealth. As a result, much of his works and reform proposals at the Consulate were oriented towards improving agriculture, livestock, manufacturing, and free trade. He maintained a fluent contact with the consulates of other cities, developing a view of the viceroyalty as a whole. This led to an increased work in cartography of the largely unpopulated areas of the territory; the maps designed during this period would later prove a great help for José de San Martín during the Crossing of the Andes. He introduced new crops, and promoted the use of local fauna for livestock production. He protected the weaving industry by increasing the production of cotton in Cochabamba, as he considered the local crop to be of similar quality to the cotton from Europe.|$|E
5|$|Romantic {{thinking}} was {{also evident in}} the writings of Hugh Miller, stonemason and geologist, who followed in the tradition of Naturphilosophie, arguing that <b>nature</b> <b>was</b> a pre-ordained progression towards the human race. Publisher, historian, antiquarian and scientist Robert Chambers (1802–71) became a friend of Scott, writing a biography of him after the author's death. Chambers also became a geologist, researching in Scandinavia and Canada. His most influential work was the anonymously published Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844), which was the most comprehensive written argument in favour of evolution before the work of Charles Darwin (1809–82). His work was strongly influenced by transcendental anatomy, which, drawing on Goethe and Lorenz Oken (1779–1851), looked for ideal patterns and structure in nature and had been pioneered in Scotland by figures including Robert Knox (1791–1862).|$|E
