The first monochrome dot matrix plasma panel displays were developed in 1964 at the University of Illinois for the PLATO educational computing system.

The relationship between these early monochrome displays and contemporary, color plasma displays and televisions was described by Larry F. Weber in 2006, [...] "All plasma TVs on the market today have the same features that were demonstrated in the first plasma display which was a device with only a single cell. These features include alternating sustain voltage, dielectric layer, wall charge, and a neon-based gas mixture." [...] As in colored neon lamps, plasma displays use a gas mixture that emits ultraviolet light. Each pixel has a phosphor that emits one of the display's base colors.|$|E
6000|$|... 1544. I {{will now}} notice a very {{remarkable}} circumstance in the luminous discharge accompanied by <b>negative</b> <b>glow,</b> which may, perhaps, be correctly traced hereafter into discharges of much higher intensity. Two brass rods, 0.3 {{of an inch}} in diameter, entering a glass globe on opposite sides, had their ends brought into contact, and the air about them very much rarefied. A discharge of electricity from the machine was then made through them, and whilst that was continued the ends were separated from each other. At the moment of separation a continuous glow came over {{the end of the}} negative rod, the positive termination remaining quite dark. As the distance was increased, a purple stream or haze appeared {{on the end of the}} positive rod, and proceeded directly outwards towards the negative rod; elongating as the interval was enlarged, but never joining the <b>negative</b> <b>glow,</b> there being always a short dark space between. This space, of about 1/16th or 1/20th of an inch, was apparently invariable in its extent and its position, relative to the negative rod; nor did the <b>negative</b> <b>glow</b> vary. Whether the negative end were inductric or inducteous, the same effect was produced. It was strange to see the positive purple haze diminish or lengthen as the ends were separated, and yet this dark space and the <b>negative</b> <b>glow</b> remain unaltered (fig. 133).|$|E

Sometimes {{when the}} {{negative}} ball was large, the machine in powerful action, and the rarefaction high, the ball {{would be covered}} over half its surface with glow, and then, upon a hasty observation, would seem to exhibit no dark space: {{but this was a}} deception, arising from the overlapping of the convex termination of the <b>negative</b> <b>glow</b> and the concave termination of the positive stream. More careful observation and experiment have convinced me, that when the <b>negative</b> <b>glow</b> occurs, it never visibly touches the luminous part of the positive discharge, but that the dark space is always there.|$|E

40|$|A fully {{developed}} hollow cathode discharge {{in which the}} <b>negative</b> <b>glows</b> from opposite walls coalesce to form full column is observed from the measured radial profile of the spectral line emission intensity from within the cathode space. The occurrence of this {{fully developed}} hollow cathode discharge is found {{to depend on the}} pressure of the working gas p, the discharge current IA and the hollow cathode configuration. The results obtained agrees with those deduced from the optimum pressure range defined in the VA versus p (IA fixed) curves. HeI triplet and singlet lines are detected under most of the discharge conditions and hollow cathode configuration investigated but the singly charged ionic line HeII 468. 57 nm is detected only at conditions under which the fully developed hollow cathode discharge is defined. The radial distribution of the ionic HeII line emission is indicative of the radial distribution of the high energy (~ 10 Â² eV, close to the cathode fall potential) electron densities and is observed to peak at the axis. The total intensities of the HeI emission lines are found to be proportional to IA(0. 8 - 1. 2) while that of the ionic HeII emission line is proportional to IA 3. 3. The width of the cathode dark space is deduced from the radial distribution profiles of the emission lines. From these, the average reduced electric field in the cathode dark space is also estimated...|$|R

If the rounded ends of two metal rods, about O.2 of an inch in diameter, are introduced into a globe or jar (the air within being rarefied), and being opposite to each other, are about four inches apart, the glow can be obtained on both rods, covering not only the ends, but {{an inch or two}} of the part behind. On using balls in the air-pump jar, and adjusting the distance and exhaustion, the negative ball could be covered with glow, whether it were the inductric or the inducteous surface.|$|E

Nitrogen {{presents}} a very remarkable discharge, between two balls {{of the respective}} diameters of 0.15 and 2 inches (1506. 1518.), the smaller one being rendered negative either directly inducteously. The peculiar discharge occurs at intervals between 0.42 and 0.68, and even at 1.4 inches when the large ball was inductric positively; it consisted of a little brushy part on the small negative ball, then a dark space, and lastly a dull straight line on the large positive ball (fig. 134.). The position of the dark space was very constant, and is probably in direct relation to the dark space described when <b>negative</b> <b>glow</b> was produced (1544.). When by any circumstance a bright spark was determined, the contrast with the peculiar spark described was very striking; for it always had a faint purple part, but the place of this part was constantly near the positive ball.|$|E

Different types of discharge configurations are discussed: pin-to-plate <b>negative</b> corona and <b>glow</b> discharge with transverse flow, hollow needle-to-plate discharge, and positive corona with transverse and axial flow. The removal fraction and the energy efficiency strongly depend on the used technique and pollutant. With DC glow discharge, a maximum removal fraction for 100 ppm, trichloroethylene (TCE) of about 47 % is obtained at an energy density of only 37 J/L. The corresponding characteristic energy epsilon(o) is 50 J/L. With a high pressure glow discharge stabilized by a microhollow cathode discharge, the removal for 300 ppm methane in atmospheric pressure air is about 80 % for an energy density of 4000 J/L. For benzene (inlet concentration: 296 ppm), the removed fraction is 90 % at energy densities of 4000 J/L. The characteristic energy 4 for methane is 1667 J/L and for benzene 1250 J/L. Next, hybrid plasma-catalytic reactor concepts aiming to obtain complete oxidation at a reduced energy cost are considered. It is shown that the combination of a plasma with a catalyst is beneficial for the VOC destruction. The VOC destruction efficiencies of a pin-to-mesh system with and without TiO 2 photo-catalyst are compared: the use of the catalyst increases the removal from 70 % to 85 %.

Two electron groups were found, slow electrons with a temperature of 0. 3 eV and density of #propor to# 10 " 1 " 1 cm"-" 3, and fast electrons with #propor to# 3. 0 eV and #propor to# 10 " 7 cm"-" 3. Under all operational conditions the plasma potential was almost constant within the <b>negative</b> <b>glow</b> and about 1. 5 V positive with respect to the anode voltage. The electric field has been calculated from the potential profile. It is shown that, within the error of measurement, this electric field is equal to the ambipolar electric field, which has been calculated from the electron density and temperature profiles. (orig.)

40|$|The <b>negative</b> <b>glow</b> of an {{abnormal}} glow discharge with a large-area cold magnesium cathode was investigated. In this kind of discharge an electron beam is formed in the cathode fall region, the energy ranging between 1 keV and 2 keV. This beam produces a cold, nearly field-free plasma at a high density. A Langmuir probe was applied {{in order to measure}} the electron density, the electron temperature, and the plasma potential. In all cases when noble gases are used two groups of electrons are found. The cold group in helium exhibits a temperature of 0. 06 eV at densities between 10 " 1 " 6 m"-" 3 and 10 " 1 " 7 m"-" 3. The density of the fast electrons falls about three orders below that of the cold group; the temperature is about 3 eV. The electric field strength was obtained from the plasma potential. It does not exceed 50 V/m in the <b>negative</b> <b>glow</b> and increases to 400 V/m towards the cathode fall. The ion and also the electron beam current could be determined from the electron density gradient {{at the edge of the}} <b>negative</b> <b>glow</b> and from the current to the cathode. By solving the diffusion equation having incorporated the production by the beam electrons the density distribution of the cold group was obtained and agreement was found with the experimental results.

The objective {{of this study is}} to model an unmagnetized DC discharge using the particle in cell with Monte Carlo collisions (PIC-MCC) method and compare the steady-state results with analytic models. Specifically, this model includes kinetic and nonequilibrium effects in 1 D and 2 D azimuthally symmetric discharges dominated by cathode fall, Faraday dark space, and <b>negative</b> <b>glow</b> regions, using He and Ar feed gases in parameter regimes relevant to materials processing. Simulation results include density striations propagating in the positive column, as well as a hot and cold electron populations in the <b>negative</b> <b>glow.</b> Cross-validation of PIC-MCC simulation and analytic models illustrates the shortcoming of the of the theoretical results and leads to the development of better analytic models with improved physics and more efficient computational models. Possible reasons for differences between the PIC and theoretical models are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} a dc {{discharge}} with a copper hollow cathode in argon used for deposition applications is investigated using atomic emission spectroscopy. Typical discharge parameters during our investigation are pressures between 80 and 200 Pa and current densities up to 7 mA cm- 2. The radial light intensity profiles of some selected copper and argon lines were measured. An {{analysis of these}} profiles gives insigths into the excitation rates of the argon filling gas and the sputtered metal atoms as well as into the radial dimension of the <b>negative</b> <b>glow.</b> The different excitation mechanisms lead to a sharp change of the radial light intensity profiles emitted by many copper spectral lines, which indicates the transition region between the cathode fall and the <b>negative</b> <b>glow.</b> The length of the cathode fall was observed to be very insensitive to all the macroscopic discharge parameters. A nearly constant value was found for the cathode fall length, which corresponds to about 22 % of the cathode radius...|$|E

40|$|A pulsed slit {{discharge}} nozzle (PDN) {{has been developed}} in our laboratory to generate molecular ions in an astrophysically relevant environment. The free cold molecular ions are formed through soft (Penning) ionization of the neutral precursor molecules seeded in a supersonic free jet and are probed with cavity ringdown spectroscopy. An attempt is made to characterize the nature {{and the structure of}} the plasma that is generated in these experiments to optimize the yield of formation of ions in the jet. The experimental conditions are characterized by a strong pressure gradient in a short discharge zone. We find that the plasma generated in the PDN source is best characterized as an intense abnormal glow discharge and that its structure is reduced to a <b>negative</b> <b>glow</b> and to dark zones near the electrodes. We have calculated the parameters (length, thickness and cathode voltage fall) that are associated with the Crookes dark space and the <b>negative</b> <b>glow</b> in the plasma. We have also estimated the electron temperature (Te) and density (ne) in the plasma. All these parameters are required to optimize the yield of formation of ions and radicals in the jet expansions, a key requirement in our experiments. 1...|$|E
40|$|In March 2002, {{we began}} {{a program in}} {{laboratory}} spectroscopy to provide accurate molecular line frequencies essential to studies of the motions and abundances in star-froming dense cores and planet-forming circumstellar disks. The CN radical {{is one of the}} most important tracers of dynamical motions in protoplanetary disks around low mass pre-main sequence stars. The millimeter-wave spectrum of CN consists of rotational transitions every 113 GHz which are split into many resolved hyperfine components. Very narrow and fairly bright lines of SiO in the ground vibrational state have been observed in regions where protostellar outflows interact with the cold ambient gas. In support of future astronomical observations in these regions, 10 successive rotational lines in the ground vibrational state of Si 0 between 86 and 500 GHz, and two lines near 800 GHz were measured in the laboratory to an accuracy of a few kHz. A <b>negative</b> <b>glow</b> discharge spectrometer that will allow the determination of accurate line frequencies of molecular ions has been constructed.

40|$|Abstract. The {{results are}} {{presented}} of investigating temporal and spatial development of electrical glow discharge in a neon filled tube under 4 mbar pressure. Linear increasing voltage (at 5 V/s increasing voltage rate) {{is applied to the}} gas diode. Time dependence of 585. 2 nm line light emitted from <b>negative</b> <b>glow</b> is observed from various positions in the diode during formation of electrical discharge. The results show that the development of glow discharge starts in the gap, and propagates to the cathode and in the space around and behind the cathode. An unexpected two-step current rise is found. In the stationary regime, most of the emitted light occupied the cathode carrier rod. This indicates the position where the secondary electron emission is intensive. It corresponds to the second step in the current increase app. 3 ms after the breakdown has already taken place. It is assumed that this step originates from different surface characteristics of the rode material. The analysis of time dependencies of the current and light from the <b>negative</b> <b>glow,</b> from different positions in the gas diode, suggests that the observation of deexcitation processes in gas can be used for determination of early discharge formative processes, as well as processes that lead to the stationary regime in the gas diode tube...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} for enhancement of positive molecular ion concentrations in a glow discharge is presented. The technique consists of modifying an anomalous glow discharge {{by the addition}} of a longitudinal magnetic field of up to 300 G. Enhancements in the ion signal strength, as measured by millimeter and submillimeter wave spectroscopy, are approximately two orders of magnitude. Evidence is presented that the magnetic field increases the length of the ion rich <b>negative</b> <b>glow</b> by restricting inside a small diameter tube the ionizing electrons accelerated by the large cathode drop of an anomalous glow discharge...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the existence of}} the electric field reversal in the <b>negative</b> <b>glow</b> of a dc discharge, its location, the width of the well trapping the electrons, the slow electrons scattering time, and as well the trapping time. Based on a stress-energy tensor analysis we show the inherent instability of the well. We suggest that the Fermi mechanism is a possible process for pumping out electrons from the through, and linking this phenomena with electrostatic plasma instabilities. A power law distribution function for trapped electrons is also obtained. Analytical expressions are derived which can be used to calculate these characteristics from geometrical dimensions and the operational parameters of the discharge. Comment: 5 page...|$|E
