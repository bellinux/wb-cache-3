5|$|Having reached Virginia, Timberlake {{set out for}} New York to {{meet with}} Amherst to receive his commission. Not long afterward, he {{received}} <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{among a number of}} officers to be reduced to half pay. Having learned this, he left the militia and returned home to Virginia to petition the General Assembly to compensate him for his expenses for the journey , but was denied.|$|E
5|$|During the half-time interval, Stein gave also Gordon Strachan <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{planned to}} bring him off {{during the second half}} and replace him with winger Davie Cooper. Stein's five-man {{defensive}} set-up meant that his midfielders were outnumbered by the Welsh, and consequently Strachan had failed to make an impact on the game up to then. Despite this, Strachan was prepared to argue with Stein that he should remain on, until Alex Ferguson cautioned him to be aware that the manager was clearly not well, and should not cause too much stress with a confrontation.|$|E
5|$|Facts were {{overwhelmed}} with sound, passion substituted for arithmetic, moral indignation pumped {{up to the}} bursting point. But Mr. Diefenbaker provided the liveliest show of the election... and many listeners undoubtedly failed to <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was saying even less than the Prime Minister, though saying it more shrilly and with evangelistic fervour... Mr. Diefenbaker has chosen instead to cast himself as the humble man in a mood of protest, the common Canadian outraged by Liberal prosperity, the little guy fighting for his rights.|$|E

5|$|Wilberforce {{had planned}} to {{introduce}} a motion giving <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would bring forward a bill for the Abolition of the Slave Trade during the 1789 parliamentary session. However, in January 1788, he was taken ill with a probable stress-related condition, now thought to be ulcerative colitis. It was several months before {{he was able to}} resume work, and he spent time convalescing at Bath and Cambridge. His regular bouts of gastrointestinal illnesses precipitated the use of moderate quantities of opium, which proved effective in alleviating his condition, and which he continued to use {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Detectives Toschi, Armstrong, and Mulanax {{question}} Arthur Leigh Allen, {{a suspect}} in the Vallejo case. Allen behaves suspiciously during the interview. They ask to see his watch and <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wears a Zodiac brand wristwatch which has the same logo used by the killer. However, a handwriting expert insists that Allen did not write the Zodiac letters, even though Allen is said to be ambidextrous. Avery receives a letter threatening his life; becoming increasingly paranoid, he turns to drugs and alcohol. At one point, he shares information with the Riverside Police Department, angering both Toschi and Armstrong. The case's notoriety weighs on Toschi, who is bothered when Graysmith shows up at the theater where Toschi is watching a Hollywood film, Dirty Harry, loosely based on the Zodiac case, with his wife.|$|E
5|$|Brandon {{invites the}} Dashwoods and the Middletons {{to a party}} on his estate at Delaford, but before the trip can take place, he is called away on urgent business. Willoughby {{requests}} a private audience with both Mrs. Dashwood and Marianne, leading them both to expect that he will propose. However, Willoughby reveals that his aunt is sending him on business to London, and {{he may not be}} able to return to Devonshire for at least a year. Shortly after Willoughby's departure, Edward comes to visit, and the Dashwoods <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> appears to be unhappy and distant. Mrs. Jennings' nieces, Lucy (Anna Madeley) and Anne Steele (Daisy Haggard), come to Barton Park. When Lucy learns that the Dashwoods are acquainted with the Ferrars, Lucy confides in Elinor that she and Edward have been secretly engaged for four years, news that devastates Elinor. Mrs. Jennings invites Elinor and Marianne to spend some time with her in London, and Marianne hopes she will see Willoughby. However, he does not visit or reply to her letters.|$|E

5|$|While {{based at}} Crosby-on-Eden with 59 OTU MacLachlan spent time flying {{other types of}} {{aircraft}} including the Bristol Beaufighter. On 20 August 1942 he was posted to the Air Fighting Development Unit at RAF Duxford for a short time. MacLachlan flew {{as often as he}} could regardless of the activity. He flew as a co-pilot in a Short Stirling heavy bomber and practiced fighter evasion techniques and then proceeded to fly 15 types of aircraft in 11 days. MacLachaln also flew Supermarine Spitfires, acting as an attacking fighter as well as the American-made Bell P-39 Airacobra. MacLachlan also flew with the No. 1426 Flight RAF which operated captured German aircraft. He flew a Ju 88, M2+MK formerly of Küsten Flieger Gruppe 106 which force-landed at RAF Chivenor in November 1941. Hew flew in a passenger on Heinkel He111 (AW177) 1H+EN of 5./KG 26 which force-landed in Scotland in February 1940. At this time he provided escort to the resident Messerschmitt Bf 110 at the unit as it moved around airfields, although it is unknown if he flew it. By 4 October 1942 he had received <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been selected as an RAF representative to tour the United States lecturing British and American trainee's in United States Army Air Force facilities. MacLachlan left 59 OTU with immediate effect.|$|E
25|$|Burke, however, {{was very}} pleased. He wrote to Fitzwilliam on 21 June to give <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{intended}} to resign {{his seat in}} the Commons. Fitzwilliam offered Burke's seat of Malton to his son Richard, who accepted.|$|E
25|$|The royalty, nobility, and gentry of Europe {{traditionally}} have many names, including phrases for the lands that they own. The French developed {{the method of}} putting the term by which the person is referred in small capital letters. It is this habit which transferred to names of the Far East, as seen below. An example is that of Marie-Joseph-Paul-Yves-Roch Gilbert du Motier, who {{is known as the}} Marquis de Lafayette. <b>Notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> possessed the lands both of Motier and Lafayette.|$|E

25|$|Pizarras slowly {{began to}} <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had to hike deeper into the forest to find one, unlike in the 1960s when one could snatch them off tree {{branches}} {{by the side of}} the road. He began keeping several of the species for feeding, breeding and display at backyard his residence in Corella, Bohol. He began to breed tarsiers in captivity so he could raise the animals he would stuff. His captive breeding program was successful that bred 20 Philippine tarsiers in captivity. He sent 10 live tarsiers bred this way to the Chicago Zoo in the United States in 1985.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} after {{claiming}} his 171st aerial victory, Schuck was wounded by glass splinters that struck his cheek and nose. A splinter penetrated his jaw and got stuck {{in one of his}} teeth. To remove this splinter he required surgery. While in the hospital recovering from this operation, Schuck received <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves. The presentation of the Oak Leaves was made on 7 November 1944 at the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM— Ministry of Aviation) in Berlin by Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring. Schuck received this award together with twelve other soldiers on this day, among them were the Fallschirmjäger Generalmajor Heinz Trettner, Oberstleutnant Friedrich August Freiherr von der Heydte, and the ground attack and bomber pilots Hauptmann Franz Kieslich and Hauptmann Diether Lukesch. Schuck was the only fighter pilot so honored on this day.|$|E
25|$|One year later, eight {{criminal}} {{fraud charges}} were {{brought by the}} Chicago U. S. Attorney against Black and three former Hollinger executives. The U.S. Attorney laid four new charges against Black on 15 December 2005, alleging racketeering, obstruction of justice, money laundering, mail fraud, tax evasion and wire fraud. Under the racketeering count, the government sought forfeiture of more than $92,000,000 (USD). The obstruction count related to Black and his chauffeur removing boxes of documents from Hollinger offices in Toronto on June 9, 2005, contrary to a court order that prohibited removal. Black contested the obstruction count {{on the grounds that}} he was obeying an eviction <b>notice,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> knew he was being filmed because he had installed the security cameras which filmed him, that he had already provided copies of every document prosecutors had asked for, and that not a single commercially relevant document in those boxes was not already possessed by prosecutors.|$|E

25|$|Eumenes II opposed him at {{the head}} of an army: but {{hostilities}} were soon suspended by the arrival of the Roman deputies, appointed by the Senate to inquire into the matters in dispute. Negotiations were accordingly opened at Pergamon but led to no result, the demands of Pharnaces being rejected by the Romans as unreasonable, and the war was in consequence renewed. It continued, apparently with various interruptions, until the summer of 179 BC, when Pharnaces, finding himself unable to cope with the combined forces of Eumenes II and Ariarathes IV, was compelled to purchase peace with the cession of all his conquests in Galatia and Paphlagonia, with the exception of Sinope. How long he continued to reign after this we know not; but it appears, from an incidental <b>notice,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was still on the throne in 170 BC, while he was certainly dead in 154 BC, when his brother Mithridates IV of Pontus is mentioned as King. The Greek historian Polybius accuses Pharnaces of having an arrogant and violent character, siding with the opinion of Eumenes II and the Romans.|$|E
25|$|While he {{continued}} to play with his band, without any real connections to the recording industry, Strait became friends with Erv Woolsey, who operated one of the bars in which the Ace in the Hole band played, and who had previously worked for the major label MCA Records. Woolsey convinced some of his Music Row (Nashville, TN) connections to come to Texas and to listen to Strait and his band play. Impressed with the performance, but concerned that they couldn't market the Western Swing sound that the band featured, they left without a deal. After several unsuccessful trips to Nashville {{in search of a}} record deal in which Strait was turned down by every label in town, he considered giving up music altogether. He was offered a job designing cattle pens and decided to take it. He gave the band <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was leaving, but after a discussion with his wife, she convinced him to give music one more year. Not long afterward, MCA signed Strait to a recording contract in February 1981. The initial deal was for one song. If the single did well, the label would then consider doing an album. The Ace in the Hole band remained with Strait, performing as the backup and touring band for the now solo act.|$|E
25|$|He {{returned}} home in 1936, recently promoted to full general, to lead Eastern Command, {{one of the}} corps-level regional commands in the United Kingdom, responsible for a single Regular division and three Territorial Army divisions. Here, he realised that a European War would come sooner rather than later, and that the Army was in a parlous state to defend the country. However, he found that as with his earlier posts, he could achieve little in Eastern Command – the most important decisions being made in Whitehall. He himself seemed to lose his opportunity for higher office in 1937, when he was rebuked over his mishandling of a mobile force in the annual exercises; until this point, he had been considered a possible candidate as Chief of the Imperial General Staff, but was dropped from consideration in favour of Lord Gort, whom Ironside considered unfit for the job. Lord Hore-Belisha gave him official <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was deemed too old for the post, aged 57. Thus, he was appointed an Aide-de-Camp to HM the King in October, a purely ceremonial position, and early in 1938 accepted the offer of Governor of Gibraltar, generally seen as a quiet role where to retire.|$|E

25|$|Born in August 1855 to Thomas and Mary Helen Lomax of Grove Park in Yoxford, Suffolk, Samuel {{joined the}} Scottish 90th Regiment of Foot {{as a junior}} officer aged {{eighteen}} in June 1874. In 1877 he travelled with his regiment to South Africa and participated in the 9th Cape Frontier War {{of the same year}} and the latter stages of the Zulu War in 1878, seeing action at Kambula and Ulundi, battles which secured British victory in the campaign. Returning to Britain with his regiment, Lomax was promoted to captain following the Cardwell Reforms which amalgamated his regiment into the Scottish Rifles in 1881. His unit was not called on for service in India or the Boer War and he did not see further action for 36 years. He was promoted to major in 1886, lieutenant-colonel in 1897, and colonel in 1901. In early 1902, he was transferred to a temporary staff posting as Assistant Adjutant General of the 2nd Army Corps, and Chief Staff Officer to Sir Evelyn Wood, commanding the corps. In 1904 he was given an operational command, 10th Brigade. He was promoted to Major-General in 1908, and in 1910 given command of the 1st Division. This was normally a four-year posting, and in late July 1914 he received <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would not be further employed due to his advanced age and lack of military experience.|$|E
500|$|While {{he was in}} London Belcher {{arranged}} for Lieutenant Governor Dummer {{to be replaced by}} William Tailer (whose appointment to that post in 1715 he had ironically managed to supersede by lobbying for Dummer's appointment), and recommended that Jeremiah Dummer (with whom his relations had become seriously strained) be dismissed as colonial agent. [...] He was well received in Massachusetts upon his arrival in 1731, but immediately began to purge opponents and their supporters from positions over which he had control. [...] This immediately put all on <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would freely use patronage power as a political weapon.|$|E
500|$|The {{pressure}} of the investigation took a psychological toll on Shea. He had trouble sleeping and began to resort to barbiturates and alcohol {{in order to help}} him cope. Shea was not the only NASA employee who found the aftermath of the fire difficult to handle: Robert Seamans wrote that [...] "key people from Houston would fly up to Washington to testify and literally sob all the way on the plane", and a man who worked under Shea suffered a nervous breakdown and was reportedly taken to a mental hospital in a straitjacket. A few weeks after the fire, Shea's colleagues began to <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> too was behaving erratically. Chris Kraft, whose father had suffered from schizophrenia, later related Shea's behavior in one meeting: ...|$|E
