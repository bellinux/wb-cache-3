This metachromatic property of AO on binding to DNA following <b>acid</b> <b>denaturation</b> was utilized to study the susceptibility of normal and ovine follicle-stimulating hormone (oFSH) actively immunized bonnet monkey spermatozoa voided throughout the year. For analyses, the scattergram generated by the emission of red and green fluorescences by 10, 000 AO-bound sperm from each semen sample was divided into 4 quadrant zones representing percentage cells fluorescing high green-low red (Q 1), high green-high red (Q 2), low green-low red (Q 3) and low green-high red.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} the comparison of three different methods and three monoclonal antibodies to stain cells in suspension for incorporated bromodeoxyuridine and total DNA content. The procedures were tested in three different experimental tumour cell lines. The sensitivity of the different procedures was expressed as the ratio of the anti-BrdUrd fluorescence intensities of the S and G 1 phase cells (FS/FG 1 ratio). There were remarkable differences in sensitivity between the different procedures. With the heat denaturation the most favourable FS/FG 1 ratio's were obtained but substantial cell loss occurred during this procedure which is a disadvantage for clinical application. With the pepsin digestion + <b>acid</b> <b>denaturation</b> procedure cell loss was negligible. The standard <b>acid</b> <b>denaturation</b> procedure was inferior to the other two methods. Using the pepsin digestion + <b>acid</b> <b>denaturation</b> procedure we examined the variations in sensitivity for the different monoclonal antibodies and cell lines and the influence of BrdUrd concentration, labelingtime and cell concentration. The binding characteristics for the various antibodies differed considerably in our hands. Only with the IU 4 antibody we obtained FS/FG 1 ratio's comparable with those described in the literature. No difference was observed between the cell lines. Variation in cell concentration between 1 x 10 (4) to 1 x 10 (6) ml nor BrdUrd concentration appeared to influence the sensitivity of the procedure. A labelingtime of 1 h or even 30 min seems to be more than sufficient for an optimal FS/FG 1 ratio. Our results indicate that using the appropriate antibody and immunofluorescence BrdUrd can be detected by flow cytometry, after incorporation into the DNA of tumour cells under a wide range of culture conditions.

40|$|Goat α-lactalbumin shows two {{spectral}} {{changes at}} acid pH. One of these {{corresponds to the}} <b>acid</b> <b>denaturation,</b> while the other has been regarded {{as a result of}} the intramolecular perturbation of tryptophans induced by the protonation of ionizable groups in the native molecule. In order to distinguish between these spectral changes and to investigate the perturbation caused by the ionizable groups, the absorption changes with a change in pH have been followed by the stopped-flow pH-jump method. Only the <b>acid</b> <b>denaturation</b> can be observed kinetically while the perturbation is too rapid to follow by the kinetic method. Extrapolations of the time-dependent absorption changes to zero time in the unfolding and refolding pH jumps give the apparent titration curves of the ionizable groups that participate in the perturbations in the native and in the acid-denatured molecule. The perturbation of the native protein is induced by the protonation of at least two ionizable groups, while the acid-denatured molecule does not show the perturbation because of the loss of the unique spatial arrangement of the ionizable groups around tryptophans. The results of circular dichroism measurements and the comparison with known results of the charge perturbation of lysozyme are also discussed...|$|R

Many molecular biology techniques have been implemented successfully in biology, biotechnology, medical science, diagnostics, and many more. The introduction of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) resulted in improving old and designing new laboratory devices for PCR amplification and analysis of amplified DNA fragments. In parallel to these efforts, the nature of DNA molecules and their construction have attracted many researchers. In addition, some studies concerning mimicking living systems, as well as developing and constructing artificial nanodevices, such as biomolecular sensors and artificial cells, have been conducted.

40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} focused on optimalization of {{temperature}} gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) for diagnosing of mutations in the GJB 2 gene. This gene encodes the protein connexin 26, {{which is part of}} the inner ear. Mutation in the gene GJB 2 are the most common cause of congenital deafness, usually with autosomal recessive inheritance. DNA samples with known genotypes, which included the mutation c. 35 delG, W 24 X and c. 358 - 360 delGAG were selected for the optimization heteroduplex analysis TGGE. The samples were provided by the Department of Medical Genetics, University Hospital Hradec Králové. TGGE method is used to separate <b>nucleid</b> <b>acids.</b> Compared to conventional electrophoresis, there is created a temperature gradient across the gel. The sample of DNA moves in an electric field at a speed proportional to their size.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Analytical {{ultracentrifugation}} {{methods were}} utilized to further characterize the <b>acid</b> <b>denaturation</b> pathways of wild-type, V 30 M, and L 55 P transthyretin (TTR) that generate intermediates leading to amyloid fibril formation {{and possibly the}} diseases senile systemic amyloidosis and familial amyloid polyneuropathy. Equilibrium and velocity methods were employed herein to characterize the TTR quaternary structural requirements for amyloid fibril formation. From neutral to slightly acidic conditions (pH 7. 5 - 5. 1), wildtype transthyretin (0. 2 - 0. 3 mg/mL, 100 mM KCl, 37 °C) exists as a tetramer and is incapable of fibril formation. Under more acidic conditions (pH 5 to 3. 9), tetrameric wild-type TTR slowly dissociates to a monomer having an alternatively folded tertiary structure(s) that self-assembles at physiological concentration (0. 2 mg/mL) into a ladder of quaternary structural intermediates of increasing molecular weight. These intermediates appear {{to be on the}} pathway of amyloid fibril formation, since they ultimately disappear when amyloid fibrils are observed. The V 30 M and L 55 P TTR variants exhibit similar <b>acid</b> <b>denaturation</b> pathways, with the exception that dissociation of the tetramer to the monomeric amyloidogenic intermediate occurs at a higher pH and to a much greater extent, allowing the quaternary structural intermediates to be readily observed by velocity methods.

The four papaya proteinases have been found to undergo, at low pH, a conformational transition that instantaneously converts their native forms into molten globules that are quite unstable and rapidly degraded by pepsin.

40|$|Lysosonial proteases of rabbit liver, {{kidney and}} pn',snorphonuclear cells were Stested {{for their ability}} to hydrolyze staphylococcal {{enterotoxin}} B, a protein exotoxin (mol. wt 28 494) of Staphylococcus aureus. All lysosomal preparations effectively inactivated and catabolized staphyl,-, u ± enterotoxin B in vitro, but only at pH values less than 3. 2 and coincident iith <b>acid</b> <b>denaturation</b> of toxiii. Mirnimal digestion of staphylococcal enterot [...] xin B without loss of biological properties was observed at lower H+ concentrations (pH 3. 5 - 6. o). Denaturation of toxin by heating or per-formic acid oxidation markedly increased the pH range as well as the extent to which staphylococcal enterotoxin B was hydrolyzed. lodination of staphylococ~al entero-toxin B by either a chloramine T or a modified enzymatic method yielded derivatives which were more resistant to lysosomnal digestion than the unmodified molecule. These results suggest that modification of a protein's native structure. may either increase or decrease its susceptibility to digestion by lysosomal proteases.

40|$|Background: Currently, {{relation}} between {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) ROS concentration and semen quality was indicated. Saffron has traditionally been not only considered as a food additive {{but also as a}} medicinal herb, which has a good antioxidant properties. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the protection potency of saffron and vitamin E on sperm chromatin integrity. Materials and Methods: Thirty adult male Wistar rats divided equally into saffron (100 mg/kg), vitamin E (100 mg/kg) and control (0. 5 cc distilled water /day) groups. After 60 days, cauda epididymis dissected and sperm cells were used for analysis of sperm chromatin packaging by chromomycin A 3 (CMA 3) staining, and sperm chromatin susceptibility to <b>acid</b> <b>denaturation</b> by acridine orange (AO) staining. Results: The mean percentage of CMA 3 positive sperm was significantly decreased in saffron and vitamin E groups relative to control group (p< 0. 001). Moreover, the AO staining results showed that the mean percentage of sperm with DNA damage was significantly decreased in saffron and vitamin E groups as compared with control group (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Our results purposed that saffron can protect sperm against DNA damage and chromatin anomalies...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{premature}} translation of the plasmid-mediated toxin in hok/sok of plasmid R 1 and pnd/pndB of plasmid R 483 is prevented during transcription of the hok and pnd mRNAs by the formation of metastable hairpins at the 5 ′-end of the mRNA. Here, an experimental approach is presented, which allows the accurate measurement of the refolding kinetics of the 5 ′-end RNA fragments in vitro without chemically modifying the RNA. The method is based on <b>acid</b> <b>denaturation</b> followed by a pH-jump to neutral pH as a novel way to trap kinetically favoured RNA secondary structures, allowing the measurement {{of a wide range of}} biologically relevant refolding rates, with or without the use of standard stopped-flow equipment. The refolding rates from the metastable to the stable conformation in both the hok 74 and pnd 58 5 ′-end RNA fragments were determined by using UV absorbance changes corresponding to the structural rearrangements. The measured energy barriers showed that the refolding path does not need complete unfolding of the metastable structures before the formation of the final structures. Two alternative models of such a pathway are discussed...|$|R
