40|$|Working Paper GATE 2008 - 03 This paper {{explores the}} {{consequences}} of introducing a monopolistic competition in an intertemporal two-sector small open economy model which produces <b>traded</b> and <b>non</b> <b>traded</b> goods. It is assumed that the <b>non</b> <b>traded</b> sector is the locus of the imperfectly competition. Our analysis shows that markup depends on the composition of aggregate <b>non</b> <b>traded</b> demand and is therefore endogenously determined in the model. Calibrating the model with OECD parameters, the effects of fiscal and technological shocks are simulated. Our findings are as follows. First, the model {{is consistent with the}} observed saving-investment correlations found in the data. Second, unlike the perfectly framework and in accordance with empirical studies, fiscal shocks cause real appreciation of the relative price of <b>non</b> <b>traded</b> goods, which in turn enlarges the responses of current account and investment. Third, the model is consistent with the empirical report that technological shocks result in current account deficits and investment rises. Fourth, the strength of the relative price appreciation following sector productivity differentials, i. e. the Balassa-Samuelson effect, is affected by the monopolistic competition hypothesis.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} permanent and temporary fiscal shocks in a two-sector small open economy. One central finding is that both the disaggregation in a <b>non</b> <b>traded</b> and traded sectors and the duration of fiscal shocks matter in determining the response of key economic variables. Similarly to a one-sector model, {{we find that the}} current account always deteriorates in the long run following a temporary fiscal policy. By contrast, unlike a one-sector economy, investment can be crowded out if the <b>non</b> <b>traded</b> sector is relatively more capital intensive. More importantly, the directions of both long-term and short-term changes in investment after a temporary fiscal expansion can be reversed compared to those following a permanent policy.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} recent {{empirical}} evidence {{available on the}} evolution of the real exchange rates within the main European economies {{in order to understand the}} possible main determinants of future inflation differentials within the EMU. The real exchange rate is decomposed into that of the traded sector and the differential across countries of the relative price of the <b>non</b> <b>traded</b> sector. Persistent deviations from PPP are found, also in the traded sector. It is also found that the main factor behind the annual bilateral real appreciation with respect to Germany since 1995 has been the differential growth of relative <b>non</b> <b>traded</b> prices across countries. In the case of France, that differential was mainly explained by a different growth of relative labor productivities in the two economies, while in the case of Spain and Italy it was mainly due to the different growth of relative non-traded markups and wages, respectively. ...|$|R

40|$|We use a neoclassical {{open economy}} model with <b>traded</b> and <b>non</b> <b>traded</b> goods to {{investigate}} the sectoral effects of three tax reforms: i) two revenue-neutral shifting the tax burden from labor to consumption taxes and ii) one labor tax restructuring keeping the marginal tax wedge constant. Regardless of its type, a tax reform crowds-in both consumption and investment and raises employment. Whereas tax reforms have a small impact on GDP, they exert substantial effects on sectoral outputs which move in opposite direction in the short-run. The sensitivity analysis reveals that raising the elasticity of labor supply or reducing the tradable content in consumption expenditure amplifies the heterogeneity in sectoral output responses. Finally, allowing for the markup {{to depend on the}} number of competitors, we find that a substantial share of sectoral output variations {{can be attributed to the}} change in the markup triggered by firm entry. <b>Non</b> <b>Traded</b> Goods; Employment; Current Account; Tax Reform. ...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the {{secondary}} loan market has developed into an over-the-counter market where loans {{are not only}} sold but also subsequently traded. This shift away from traditional banking is altering the business of lending. Loan sales are valuable to banks because they free up capital, generate fee-based income and facilitate risk management; {{but they may be}} costly to borrowers because they negatively affect bank monitoring incentives. In this paper, however, we argue that there is another potential benefit to borrowers from loan sales. Borrowers with <b>trading</b> <b>loans,</b> in particular those with liquid loans, may "demand" a share of bank benefits from loan sales when they take out new loans as it will be easier for banks to sell these loans afterwards. We investigate this potential benefit of {{the secondary}} loan market by comparing the interest rates borrowers pay before their <b>loans</b> start to <b>trade</b> with the interest rates they pay on loans originated post-trading. Our results show that, on average, borrowers pay higher spreads on the loans they take out after the onset of <b>trading</b> on their <b>loans.</b> Importantly, our results also show that borrowers with liquid <b>trading</b> <b>loans</b> are able to borrow at lower interest rates after the onset of <b>trading</b> on their <b>loans.</b> Thus, while the banks' decision to sell loans may initially impose a cost on borrowers, those whose loans enter the secondary loan market and become liquid benefit from an interest rate discount on their subsequent loans.

40|$|Neoclassical theory {{says that}} {{financial}} liberalization {{will make the}} cost of capital decrease, productivity increase and output grow. In reality this does not happen. A key to understanding {{why it is so}} is the link between financial liberalization and income distribution. After financial liberalizations both the real interest rate and the supply of credit to the <b>non</b> <b>traded</b> goods sector rise. If the monetary interest rate and the profit rate tend to be equal in the long run, a reshuffling of production favouring the non-traded goods sector will occur; for the mark-up may be higher in this sector than in the traded goods sector {{due to the lack of}} international competition. Households, no more credit constrained, will increase their demand for <b>non</b> <b>traded</b> goods; profits in this sector will increase too due to the higher capacity utilization. On the other hand the likely fall in the propensity to save of capitalists will cause a slower capital accumulation. Thus neither investment nor productivity will rise. This may not be due to the working of real forces alone, such as trade liberalization, but rather to the interplay of both monetary and real factors. A vicious circle of lower growth and rising inequality could be set in motion...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} financial restatements on the debt market. Specifically, {{we focus on the}} secondary loan market, which {{has become one of the}} largest capital markets in the US, and ask the following: (1) whether financial restatements increase restating firm’s cost of debt financing and (2) whether the information about restatements arrives at the secondary loan market earlier than at the stock market? Using 176 restatement data, we find significant negative abnormal loan returns and increased bid-ask spreads around restatement announcements. Furthermore, this negative loan market reaction is more pronounced when the restatement is initiated by either the SEC or auditors, and when the primary reason for restatement is related to revenue recognition issues. Additionally, we find restatement information arrives at the secondary loan market earlier than at the equity market, and that such private information quickly flows into the equity market. We also show that stock prices begin to decline approximately 30 days prior to the restatement announcements for firms with <b>traded</b> <b>loans.</b> However, we do not find such informational leakage for firms without <b>traded</b> <b>loans.</b> Collectively, the results of this paper suggest: (1) increased cost of debt financing after restatements and (2) superior informational efficiency of the secondary loan market to the stock market...|$|R

The Balassa- Samuelson [1964] model predicts that {{a rise in the}} sectoral productivity ratio by 1 % raises the relative price of non tradables by 1 % while leaving the <b>non</b> <b>traded</b> wage-traded wage ratio unchanged. Applying cointegration methods to a panel of fourteen OECD countries over the period 1970 - 2007, our estimates show that the relative price rises by only 0. 78 % and the relative wage falls by 0. 27 %. While our first set of empirical findings cast doubt on the quantitative predictions of the Balassa-Samuelson model, our second set of evidence highlights the role of imperfect labor mobility: the relative price responds more to a productivity differential between tradables and non tradables while the reaction of the relative wage is more muted in countries with higher intersectoral reallocation of labor. We show that the ability of the two-sector model to account for our evidence quantitatively relies upon two ingredients: i) imperfect mobility of labor across sectors, and ii) physical capital accumulation. Finally, our numerical results reveal that the model predicts the relative price response fairly well, {{and to a lesser extent}} the relative wage response...|$|R
