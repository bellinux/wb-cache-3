5|$|Despite {{his success}} on the field, Macartney still had a regular job outside of cricket, as with most cricketers of the era. In 1914, he left his job on the Sydney wharves and joined the staff of New South Wales Railways & Tramways in the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office at Redfern. The {{following}} season, he scored 191 runs at 38.20 including a century in three matches. He did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> wicket.|$|E
5|$|Every {{city in the}} {{territory}} of modern Argentina other than Córdoba endorsed the Primera Junta. The cities of the Upper Peru, however, did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> position, owing to the recent outcomes of the Chuquisaca and La Paz Revolutions. Asunción del Paraguay rejected the Junta and swore loyalty to the Council of Regency. The Banda Oriental, under Francisco Javier de Elío, remained a royalist stronghold.|$|E
5|$|Macartney {{finished}} with 61 in the drawn Fifth Test at The Oval, {{to head the}} run-scoring with 300 runs at 42.85 as Australia took the series 3–0. He did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> wicket in the Tests. Macartney then scored 121 against Gloucestershire in an innings victory immediately after the Tests, but did not pass 45 in the remaining four matches of the tour. Macartney topped the batting aggregates and averages with 2,317 runs at 59.41 in the first-class matches. He took only eight wickets at 32.63 for the entire tour.|$|E

5|$|Major issues {{brought up}} during the {{campaign}} were the candidates' positions on President Obama's stimulus plan, which Tedisco did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> stance on {{until late in the}} race. Murphy supported it while Tedisco eventually opposed it. Tedisco portrayed Murphy's support of the plan as a potential cause of the AIG bonus scandal. Tedisco's campaign also brought up Murphy's failure to pay taxes on a company he founded in the 1990s. A frequent Murphy talking point was that Tedisco's primary residence was not in the Congressional district.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Winston Churchill {{suggested}} {{reviving the}} Order in 1943 to recognise {{the services of}} General The Hon. Sir Harold Alexander in Tunisia, but {{the opinion of the}} other ministers and civil servants was that it would upset the diplomatic balance between London and Dublin. Taoiseach Seán Lemass considered reviving the Order during the 1960s, but did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> decision.|$|E
5|$|This {{left only}} two non-first-class matches against Scotland to {{complete}} the tour. Miller played {{in the first game}} and scored six in his only innings and did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> wicket, before being rested for the second match. Australia won both matches by an innings. As a result, Australia finished the tour with 25wins and nine draws. They had gone through the summer without defeat.|$|E

5|$|As {{opportunities}} for slow bowling became infrequent, he contemplated retirement. Although he dismissed Cyril Washbrook {{in the first}} over of Victoria's match against Wally Hammond's touring England team of 1946–47, he was skeptical about his pace bowling. After that match he did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> wicket {{for the next two}} months. It took further encouragement from Australian captain Don Bradman after he played against Bradman's South Australians. Bradman told Johnston that the selectors thought highly of his potential as a medium-fast bowler to reinforce the short bursts of pace spearheads Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller and that pace bowlers were in short supply, whereas spinners were plentiful. In the same season, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson, Bruce Dooland and George Tribe had all played in Tests as specialist spinners. Johnston ended the season with only 12 wickets at 33.16 from six matches.|$|E
5|$|Brudenell {{was a fine}} rider and, {{inspired}} by the decisive role of cavalry {{at the battle of}} Waterloo, his wish was to purchase a commission in a fashionable regiment and serve as an army officer. His father, however, mindful of preserving the family pedigree from risk of battle, would not allow this. Instead in November 1815 he was sent up to Christ Church, Oxford; as an aristocrat he was automatically granted admission without examination. He left in his third year—aristocrats with no academic bent were released after only two years—but despite showing some aptitude, he did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> degree.|$|E
5|$|Downloadable content (DLC) was {{initially}} {{not part of}} the development team's plans. The Missing Link began development later in development, when the main game's visual theme had been finalized. Only the core developers were involved in creating The Missing Link, though development on the DLC did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> high priority for some time as it would take resources away from the development of Human Revolution. Director Jean-François Dugas, producer David Anfossi, and art director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête all returned to their previous roles. The main designer was Antoine Thisdale. Main writer Mary DeMarle returned to write the scenario, alongside supplementary writer and author James Swallow. Additional music was composed for The Missing Link by the game's composer Michael McCann. He wanted to include music from the DLC in the game's , but recording for the release was already complete, and scheduling conflicts prevented him from including any music in the soundtrack. Despite this, he still wished to release the DLC soundtrack.|$|E

5|$|Gould {{was born}} in Sydney, the son of {{solicitor}} John Morton Gould and his wife Anne (née Livingstone). He attended William Woolls' school in Parramatta, {{and went on to}} study law at the University of Sydney, although he did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> degree. He served his articles with his father and was admitted to the bar in December 1870. He then worked in Singleton for a Sydney legal firm. Gould also developed significant business interests, being involved with the Great Cobar Copper Mining syndicate and serving as a director of the Electric Light and Power Supply Company, the City Bank of Sydney and the Oriental Timber Corporation. On 12 September 1872, he married Jeanette Jessie Maitland at St Paul's Church of England in West Maitland.|$|E
5|$|In the {{remainder}} of the season, Bosanquet never took more than three wickets in an innings, although he scored a century against Essex and three other fifties. He played for the Gentlemen against the Players scoring 38 and 19 but did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> wicket in the 17 overs he bowled. In 20 first-class matches, Bosanquet scored 1,198 runs (average 37.43) and took 63 wickets (average 27.77). After this season, he rarely bowled and later stated that he did not bowl the googly after 1905, particularly after one embarrassing attempt to do so in a match at Harrow. In another eight seasons of first-class cricket, he took only 22 wickets. However, his batting seemed to improve in this time.|$|E
5|$|Little is {{recorded}} of MacGregor's childhood. After his father's death in 1794, {{he and his}} two sisters were raised primarily by his mother {{with the help of}} various relatives. MacGregor's biographer David Sinclair speculates that he would probably have spoken mainly Gaelic during his early childhood, and learned English only after starting school around the age of five-and-a-half. MacGregor would claim in later life to have studied at the University of Edinburgh between 1802 and 1803; records of this do not survive as he did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> degree, but Sinclair considers it plausible, citing MacGregor's apparent sophistication and his mother's connections in Edinburgh.|$|E

The October 1964 general election brought Labour a narrow victory under Harold Wilson, while in Liverpool Exchange, Bessie achieved her best personal majority to date, 9,746. She did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> post in the new government; according to The Guardian she was offered a job, but declined on the grounds of health and age. Although she fought the next election, in March 1966, and held Liverpool Exchange easily, for the final six years of her parliamentary life she was relatively inactive and often absent through illness. Her last contribution in the House was on 27January 1969, a question regarding facilities for disabled drivers.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} {{of the first half of}} 1876, Sitting Bull's camp {{continually}} expanded, as natives joined him for safety in numbers. His leadership had attracted warriors and families, creating an extensive village estimated at more than 10,000 people. Lt. Col. Custer came across this large camp on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> direct military role in the ensuing battle; instead he acted as a spiritual leader. A week prior to the attack, he had performed the Sun Dance, in which he fasted and sacrificed over 100 pieces of flesh from his arms.|$|E
