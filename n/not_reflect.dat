5|$|A {{draft design}} was {{completed}} without foreign assistance by the Construction Department on 11 July 1939, {{but it did}} <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> the numerous technical developments that had entered capital ship designs after the First World War. In particular, its armor scheme was utterly obsolete, as it lacked any substantial amount of deck armor or good underwater protection; it came closer to the designs of 20 to 25years previous than {{to that of a}} modern warship.|$|E
5|$|Criminal defense {{attorneys}} and civil libertarians such as Virginia Sloan of the Constitution Project praised the ruling for protecting Fourth Amendment rights against government intrusion through modern technology.

5|$|The {{album was}} further {{promoted}} {{on her first}} headlining tour, The Virgin Tour, which only visited cities in the United States and Canada. Early on there were plans to schedule dates in England and Japan due to Madonna's large fan base in both countries. However, the final schedule did <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> the idea. In the end several more US dates were added and moved to larger concert venues due to overwhelmingly strong ticket sales.|$|E

Nevertheless, based on healthy populations {{in other parts of}} the West, especially New Mexico, the IUCN rates the animal Least Concern. For the timber rattlesnake (West Virginia), the IUCN notes the animal as losing range in many parts of the northeastern U.S., but because the animal is numerous in the southern Appalachians, it is also Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|As of June 2012, {{current issues}} do <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> the {{expansion}} of the European Union, as Cyprus is not depicted on current notes as the map does not extend far enough east and Malta is also missing as it does not meet the current series' minimum size for depiction. Since the European Central Bank plans to redesign the notes every seven or eight years after each issue, a second series of banknotes is already in preparation. New production and anti-counterfeiting techniques will be employed on the new notes, but the design will be of the same theme and colours identical of the current series; bridges and arches. However, they would still be recognisable as a new series.|$|E
5|$|Casino Royale {{deals with}} the {{question}} of Anglo-American relations, reflecting the real-world central role of the US in the defence of the West. The academic Jeremy Black points to the 1951 defections of two members of MI6—Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean—to the Soviet Union as having a major impact on how Britain was poorly viewed in US intelligence circles; Fleming was aware of this tension between the two countries, but he did not focus on it too strongly, and Bond and Leiter's warm relationship did <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> the reality of the US-UK relationship.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{nomenclature}} of Diet (Assembly or Parliament), {{this institution}} should {{in no way}} be construed as a broadly, or popularly, elected group of representatives. Many of the states did not have constitutions, and those that did, such as the Duchy of Baden, based suffrage on strict property requirements which effectively limited suffrage to {{a small portion of}} the male population. Furthermore, this impractical solution did <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> the new status of Prussia in the overall scheme. Although the Prussian army had been dramatically defeated in the 1806 Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, it had made a spectacular comeback at Waterloo. Consequently, Prussian leaders expected to play a pivotal role in German politics.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} election, {{tensions}} grew between the French and British delegations, already in Singapore. The Paris bid team considered submitting {{a complaint against}} London bid consultants Jim Sloman and Rod Sheard after they stated that the Stade de France was not adequate for athletics, an action that goes against the IOC rules which forbid any bid to make statements about a rival bid. The London team promptly denied {{that the two men}} were under contract with the bid at that time, and underlined that their opinions did <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> the views of the London bid.|$|E

Kaney applied to strike out the claim before filing a defence, on the basis that the claim could not possibly succeed given the binding authority of the Court of Appeal decision of Stanton v Callaghan in 1998 that expert witnesses could not be sued for negligence when preparing a joint statement with the opposing side's expert witness.|$|E

5|$|Kou Yaginuma's initial {{inspiration}} for the story came from a statement he once read describing the Hohner Little Lady harmonica {{as one of the}} first musical instruments taken into space. However, as an aspiring manga artist, Yaginuma had neither resources to conduct research on nor knowledge pertaining to spaceflight. He also hesitated to write the series because his own life experiences did <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> the dreams of his characters. Despite these challenges, Yaginuma found comfort in the determination of his characters, especially that of Asumi Kamogawa.|$|E
5|$|Murder on the Orient Express is {{the first}} game in the Agatha Christie series to feature Hercule Poirot, Christie's most popular and famous detective. David Suchet, whose {{portrayal}} of Poirot achieved fame through the popular television series Agatha Christie's Poirot, was hired to provide Poirot's voice. His performance was generally met with praise. Some have criticized the game for not allowing the player to actually control Poirot; the developers explained this choice by saying that adventure gamers who make mistakes throughout the game do <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> the genius of Poirot, but are better represented by amateur sleuth Antoinette Marceau.|$|E

5|$|The Badami cave temples are {{carved out}} of soft Badami {{sandstone}} on a hill cliff. The plan {{of each of the}} four caves (1 to 4) includes an entrance with a verandah (mukha mandapa) supported by stone columns and brackets, a distinctive feature of these caves, leading to a columned mandapa, or main hall (also maha mandapa), and then to the small, square shrine (sanctum sanctorum, garbha ghriya) cut deep inside the cave. The cave temples are linked by a stepped path with intermediate terraces overlooking the town and lake. The cave temples are labelled 1–4 in their ascending series; this numbering does <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> the sequence of excavation.|$|E
5|$|The central {{discussion}} {{within the}} poem is {{on the nature of}} time and salvation. Eliot emphasises the need of the individual to focus on the present moment and to {{know that there is a}} universal order. By understanding the nature of time and the order of the universe, mankind is able to recognise God and seek redemption. Many reviewers of Burnt Norton focused on the uniqueness and beauty of the poem. However, others complained that the poem does <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> Eliot's earlier greatness and that the use of Christian themes harmed the poem.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the overlap between AS and high-functioning autism (HFA—autism unaccompanied by {{intellectual}} disability) is unclear. The ASD classification is to some extent an artifact of how autism was discovered, and may <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> {{the true nature of}} the spectrum; methodological problems have beset Asperger syndrome as a valid diagnosis from the outset. In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published in May 2013, AS, as a separate diagnosis, was eliminated and folded into autism spectrum disorder. Like the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, the change was controversial and AS was not removed from the WHO's ICD-10.|$|E
