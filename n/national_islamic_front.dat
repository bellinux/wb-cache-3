However, when the <b>National</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Front</b> overthrew the elected government of Sadiq al-Mahdi {{with the help of}} the military, discrimination against Copts returned in earnest.

25|$|Until the {{election}} of Hamas in Gaza, Sudan was the one country where the Brotherhood was most successful in gaining power, its members making up {{a large part of}} the government officialdom following the 1989 coup d'état by General Omar al-Bashir. However, the Sudanese government dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood affiliated <b>National</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Front</b> (NIF) has come under considerable criticism for its human rights policies, links to terrorist groups, and war in southern Sudan and Darfur.|$|E

25|$|In June 1986, Sadiq al Mahdi {{formed a}} {{coalition}} government with Umma Party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the <b>National</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Front</b> (NIF), and four southern parties. Unfortunately, however, Sadiq {{proved to be a}} weak leader and incapable of governing Sudan. Party factionalism, corruption, personal rivalries, scandals, and political instability characterized the Sadiq regime. After less than a year in office, Sadiq al Mahdi dismissed the government because it had failed to draft a new penal code to replace the sharia, reach an agreement with the IMF, end the civil war in the south, or devise a scheme to attract remittances from Sudanese expatriates. To retain the support of the DUP and the southern political parties, Sadiq formed another ineffective coalition government.|$|E
25|$|A {{movement}} that spread widely in Sudan in the 1960s, {{responding to the}} efforts to secularize Islamic society, was the Muslim Brotherhood (Al Ikhwan al Muslimin). Originally the Muslim Brotherhood, often known simply as the Brotherhood, was conceived as a religious revivalist {{movement that}} sought {{to return to the}} fundamentals of Islam {{in a way that would}} be compatible with the technological innovations introduced from the West. Disciplined, highly motivated, and well financed the Brotherhood became a powerful political force during the 1970s and 1980s, although it represented only a small minority of Sudanese. In the government that was formed in June 1989, following a bloodless coup d'état, the Brotherhood exerted influence through its political wing, the <b>National</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Front</b> (NIF) party, which included several cabinet members among its adherents.|$|E
25|$|After {{collaborating with}} the Arab {{nationalist}} Sudanese government for years, the Ba'ath Party broke off relations and became an opposition party in 1990; this would have disturbed Iraq if Sudan had not supported it during the 1991 Gulf crisis. In 1990, the party was composed largely of students who had studied in Ba'athist Iraq. The party, which was small in 1990, was influential in certain sectors, was opposed to the <b>National</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Front</b> and was staunchly secularist. Members have historically been torned between the Ba'ath and other secular party movements, such as the Sudanese communists. Because of Saddam Hussein's amicable relationship with the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation, the body ruling Sudan, the Ba'ath branched was oppressed by the authorities. Later in 1990, 26 Ba'athi military officers were executed in Khartoum after a failed military coup. In 2002 a group led by Mohamad Ali Jadein {{broke away from the}} branch and established the independent Sudanese Ba'ath Party, which has no affiliation with neither the pro-Iraq Ba'ath movement nor the pro-Syrian Ba'ath movement. The following year, after the invasion of Iraq, 80 Sudanese Ba'athists return to Sudan under the condition that they would stay out of politics.|$|E

50|$|After {{three months}} of protests in 2011, many Salafist Islamist prisoners managed to be {{released}} from Sednaya Prison, including Zahran Alloush and Hassan Aboud. They formed their own Islamist groups and took up arms against the Syrian Government. Many of them became leaders of Islamist groups in the <b>Islamic</b> <b>Front</b> such as Jaysh al-Islam and Ahrar ash-Sham. Some of those groups formed an Islamist alliance named the Syrian <b>Islamic</b> <b>Front.</b> In November 2013, the Syrian <b>Islamic</b> <b>Front</b> was dissolved, as the organization was replaced by the <b>Islamic</b> <b>Front.</b>|$|R
50|$|By early 2014, the <b>Islamic</b> <b>Front</b> had {{condemned}} {{the actions of}} the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; and some factions within the alliance attacked it. Several <b>Islamic</b> <b>Front</b> brigades, including Suqour al-Sham and Ahrar ash-Sham, developed internal divisions on how to or even whether to confront the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In August 2014, 800 fighters from the <b>Islamic</b> <b>Front</b> defected to Free Syrian Army groups in the northern and eastern Aleppo Governorate.

500|$|Clarke {{stated that}} {{intelligence}} linked bin Laden to Al-Shifa's {{current and past}} operators, namely Iraqi nerve gas experts such as Emad al-Ani and Sudan's ruling <b>National</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Front.</b> Since 1995, the CIA had received intelligence suggesting collaboration between Sudan and bin Laden to produce chemical weapons for attacking American military personnel based in Saudi Arabia. Since 1989, the Sudanese opposition and Uganda had alleged that the regime was manufacturing and using chemical weapons, although the U.S. did not accuse Sudan of chemical weapons proliferation. Al-Qaeda defector Jamal al-Fadl had also spoken of bin Laden's desire to obtain weapons of mass destruction, and an August 4 CIA intelligence report suggested bin Laden [...] "had already acquired chemical weapons and might be ready to attack". Cohen later testified that physical evidence, technical and human intelligence, and the site's security and purported links to bin Laden backed the intelligence community's view that the Al-Shifa plant was producing chemical weapons and associated with terrorists.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, in 1997 the Sudanese {{government}} of the <b>National</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Front</b> had begun {{to back away from}} its previous hard-line stance. [...] This was prompted by the leadership of new President Omar al-Bashir, who wanted to ensure export of the oil from the newly developed fields being wrested from SPLA control. The U.S. had also taken a more proactive stance against the <b>National</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Front</b> government. [...] U.S. pressure on Sudan intensified following the 1998 bombing of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania by al-Qaeda operatives with links to Sudan. [...] Over the next several years, Khartoum is believed to have substantially curtailed aid to the LRA. In 1999 the Carter Center mediated the Nairobi Agreement between Uganda and Sudan, which restored diplomatic relations in 2001.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, in 1997 the Sudanese {{government}} of the <b>National</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Front</b> began to recede from its previous hard-line stance. Following the 11 September 2001 attacks in the U.S., the relationship between Sudan and Uganda abruptly changed. Cross-border tensions eased as support to proxy forces fell.

2500|$|In modern times, {{economic}} {{policies of the}} 1979 Islamic Revolution in predominantly Shia Iran were heavily statist with a very large public sector, and official rhetoric celebrating revolution {{and the rights of}} the dispossessed, although this tendency has faded over time. [...] In Sudan, the policies of the <b>National</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Front</b> party dominated regime in the 1990s have been the reverse, employing economic liberalism and accepting [...] "market forces in the formulation of state policies." [...] In Algeria, Jordan, Egypt, and Pakistan, Islamist parties have supported populist policies, showing a [...] "marked reluctance to adopt austerity policies and decreased subsidies." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{decade of}} the 1990s also saw a [...] "top down" [...] Islamisation of Sudan under the <b>National</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Front</b> and Hasan al-Turabi. Education was {{overhauled}} {{to focus on the}} glory of Arab and Islamic culture, and memorizing the Quran; school uniforms were replaced with combat fatigues and students engaged in paramilitary drills. Religious police in the capital ensured that women were veiled, especially in government offices and universities.

2500|$|An {{offshoot}} of the Sudanese branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamic Charter Front grew during the 1960, with Islamic scholar Hasan al-Turabi becoming its Secretary general in 1964. The Islamic Charter Front (ICM) was renamed several times most recently being called the <b>National</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Front</b> (NIF). The Muslim Brotherhood/NIF's main objective in Sudan was to Islamize the society [...] "from above" [...] and to institutionalize the Islamic law throughout the country where they succeeded. To that end the party infiltrated the top echelons of the government where the education of party cadre, frequently acquired in the West, made them [...] "indispensable". This approach was described by Turabi himself as the `jurisprudence of necessity`.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2002, the UPDF {{launched}} a massive military offensive, named [...] "Operation Iron Fist", against the LRA bases in southern Sudan.

[...] This was part of its efforts to broadcast its new status as an engaged {{member of the international}} community. [...] This agreement, coupled with the return of Ugandan forces that had been deployed in the Democratic Republic of Congo upon the official end of the Second Congo War, created what the Ugandan government felt was an ideal situation in which to end a conflict that had become both an embarrassment and political liability.|$|E
