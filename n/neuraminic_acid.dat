Bound IgE sharply increased the receptor's electrokinetic mobility, whereas removal of cell surface <b>neuraminic</b> <b>acids</b> cut it to near zero. In contrast, we found only a small difference between the lateral diffusion coefficients (D) of vacant and IgE-occupied Fc receptors (D: 4 vs. 3 X 10 (- 10) cm 2 /s at 24 degrees C). This is true for monomeric rat IgE; with mouse IgE, the difference in apparent diffusion rates was slightly greater (D: 4. 5 vs. 2. 3 X 10 (- 10) cm 2 /s at 24 degrees C). This range of D values is close to that found in previous photobleaching studies of the IgE-Fc epsilon receptor complex in RBL cells and rat mast cells. Moreover, enzymatic depletion of cell coat components did not measurably alter the diffusion rate of IgE-occupied receptors. Thus, binding of fluorescent macromolecular probes to cell surface proteins need not severely impede lateral diffusion of the probed species. If the glycocalyx of RBL cells does limit lateral diffusion of the Fc epsilon receptor, it must act primarily on the receptor itself, rather than on receptor-bound IgE...|$|R

In this study, HDL was isolated from plasma by sequential micro-ultracentrifugation, followed by glycoprotein and glycolipid analysis. N-Glycans, glycopeptides, and gangliosides were extracted and purified followed by analysis with nano-HPLC Chip quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry and MS/MS. HDL particles were found to be highly sialylated. Most of the N-glycans (∼ 90 %) from HDL glycoproteins were sialylated with one or two <b>neuraminic</b> <b>acids</b> (Neu 5 Ac). The most abundant N-glycan was a biantennary complex type glycan with two sialic acids (Hexose 5 HexNAc 4 Neu 5 Ac 2) and was found in multiple glycoproteins using site-specific glycosylation analysis.

40|$|Murine polyomavirus (Py) {{infection}} initiates by {{the recognition}} of cell membrane molecules containing terminal sialic acid (SA) residues through specific binding pockets formed at the major capsid protein VP 1 surface. VP 1 Pockets 1, 2, and 3 bind terminal SA, Gal, and second branched SA, respectively. The consequence of recognition on viral cell entry remains elusive. In this work, we show that preincubation of Py with soluble compounds within Pocket 1 (N-acetyl or N-glycolyl <b>neuraminic</b> <b>acids)</b> increases Py cell binding and infectivity in murine 3 T 6 fibroblasts. In contrast, Gal does not significantly alter Py binding nor infectivity, whereas sialyllactose, in Pockets 1 and 2, decreases cell binding and infectivity. Binding experiments with Py virus-like particles confirmed the direct involvement of VP 1 in this effect. To determine whether such results could reflect VP 1 conformational changes induced by SA binding, protease digestion assays were performed after pretreatment of Py or virus-like particles with soluble receptor fragments. Binding of SA with the VP 1 Pocket 1, but not of compounds interacting with Pocket 2, {{was associated with a}} transition of this protein from a protease-sensitive to a protease-resistant state. This effect was transmitted to the minor capsid proteins VP 2 and VP 3 in virus particles. Attachment of Py to cell monolayers similarly led to a VP 1 trypsin-resistant pattern. Taken together, these data present evidence that initial binding of Py to terminal SA induces conformational changes in the viral capsid, which may influence subsequent virus cell entry steps.

40|$|The sialylation of glycoconjugates is {{important}} for many cellular processes in cells and cell-cell contacts. Besides cell differentiation, inflammation, cell adhesion and pathogenesis, sialic acids influence the stability of glycoproteins. If these terminal monosaccharides are cleaved by sialidases glycoproteins bind to the asialoglycoprotein receptor and are degradated. The selective modification of monosaccharides should be tested for their influences on sialidase activities in comparison to native oligosaccharides. The supplementation of CHO cells (murine) and HEK 293, K- 562 (both human) with 2 -deoxy-d-galactose (2 dGal) led to an exchange against subterminal galactose. In CHO cells the glycans of membrane proteins had 62 % 2 -deoxy-galactoses incorporated in a nearly complete sialidase A resistance. The human cell lines showed incorporation rates of 23 - 25 % for 2 dGal. In comparison to unmodified oligosaccharides a 1, 6 -fold increased resistance was determined in K- 562. In the case of HEK 293 glycans were more sensitive against sialidase A treatment. Generally 2 dGal induced a reduction in glycosylation. The also generated non-native sialic acids did not change the glycan profiles but the behaviour of these terminal monosaccharides. N-Acetylmannoseamines with modifications in the acetyl-group were used like native precursors of sialic acids and the resulting new <b>neuraminic</b> <b>acids</b> reached incorporation rates of 45 - 92 %. The highest sialidase C resistance was detected for N-butanoyl- and N-pentanoylmannoseamine which also have shown the lowest incorporation rates.

Both modifications, 2 dGal and N-Acylmannoseamines, are good possibilities to modify the lifetime of glycoproteins.

N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) is synthesized by the cytidine monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH), an enzyme expressed in all mammals except humans. In mice, this sugar is synthesized in several somatic tissues. Methods We used the B 16 melanoma and F 3 II mammary carcinoma mouse tumor cell lines. By CMAH directed RT-PCR and NeuGc detection with the specific anti-NeuGc-GM 3 antibody 14 F 7 we evaluated enzyme and ganglioside expression in tumor cells, respectively. Expression of NeuGc-GM 3 ganglioside was reached by in vitro incubation with NeuGc-rich bovine submaxillary mucin and evaluated by slot-blot and immunohistochemistry assays using the 14 F 7 antibody. Tumor cells treated with mucin or purified NeuGc were injected s. c. and i. v. in syngeneic mice to evaluate tumor and metastatic growth. Results In the present work we demonstrated the absence of expression of CMAH enzyme in B 16 melanoma and F 3 II mammary carcinoma cells. In vitro incubation of these NeuGc-negative cells with NeuGc-rich mucin increased the presence of NeuGc in cell membranes for at least 48 - 72 h, as a component of the GM 3 ganglioside. Preincubation with NeuGc-rich mucin reduced tumor latency and increased the metastatic potential of tumor cells in syngeneic animals. Similar results were obtained when cells were incubated with purified NeuGc alone. Conclusion Our results indicate that B 16 and F 3 II mouse tumor cell lines do not express NeuGc in cell membranes but they are able to incorporate NeuGc from an exogenous source, contributing to the malignant phenotype of melanoma and mammary carcinoma cells. </p...|$|R

General discussion [...] AppendicesThe study of membrane proteins {{has become increasingly}} important, as they play a number of cellular roles such as signal transduction, cell adhesion and cell communication. However, membrane proteomics has often been hampered by the low abundance, extreme hydrophobicity and large size of membrane proteins and therefore alternative enrichment strategies are required to efficiently analyse these types of proteins. In this thesis, we developed an alternative strategy for enriching membrane proteins by targeting both the hydrophobicity and glycosylation of these proteins, which involved (1) Triton X- 114 detergent phase partitioning (2) isolation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored proteins and (3) glycoprotein capture using either lectin affinity or hydrazine chemistry. Using this strategy we identified four predicted GPI-anchored proteins and two glycoproteins (Limbic system-associated membrane protein precursor (LSAMP) and Neuronal growth regulator 1 precursor) that have not previously {{been seen in the}} liver. The capture of membrane glycoproteins by lectin affinity and hydrazine chemistry resulted in mostly different populations of enriched glycoproteins demonstrating the complementarity of the two glycocapture approaches. Lectins are often preferred as tools for studying glycoproteins because the sugars on the enriched proteins remain intact compared to the hydrazine capture approach. The selectivity and specificity of lectins for specific glycan structures however, was not reflected in the glycoforms retained from a complex mixture of proteins such as those present in the liver membrane. The use of ConA and WGA for enrichment of membrane glycoproteins showed little difference between the N-glycans on the bound proteins compared to those unbound. Only Jacalin appeared to enrich for O-glycan containing glycoproteins from the liver membrane preparation. Lectins are valuable tools for enrichment and fractionation of glycoproteins; however detailed structural analysis must be undertaken to define specific differences in the glycosylation of the proteins of interest in a complex mixture. Applying label-free shotgun proteomics we determined that the presence of a distal Engelbreth-Holm Swarm (EHS) sarcoma and a distal colon 26 (C 26) adenocarcinoma could induce differential expression of many metabolic classes of hepatic enzymes of cancer bearing mice, demonstrating the extensive systemic effect of a distal cancer on the functions of the liver. In particular, we determined that many enzymes involved in the protein glycosylation machinery in the liver were differentially expressed in cancer-bearing mice. Glycomics analysis determined that differential expression of these enzymes was reflected in changes to specific glycan structures expressed on the liver membrane glycoproteins. Both distal cancer models (EHS sarcoma and C 26 adenocarcinoma) resulted in an overall increased sialylation of N-glycans presented on the liver cell membrane proteins compared to the control. The liver membrane glycoproteins of EHS-bearing mice showed increased sialylation of core 1 and core 2 O-glycans containing NeuGc residues, whilst there were no observable O-glycan differences observed on the liver membrane proteins of non-cachectic and cachectic C 26 -bearing mice. Specifically, both EHS bearing mice and non-cachectic mice bearing the C 26 adenocarcinoma were shown to preferentially display more N-acetyl <b>neuraminic</b> <b>acids</b> (NeuAc) than N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) on their N-glycans. The preferred expression of NeuAc-containing glycans over the more common NeuGc-containing glycans suggests that the CMP-hydroxylase enzyme, which converts NeuAc to NeuGc, had impaired function and/or expression in these mice. There was also increased expression of N-glycan structures containing NeuAcα(2 - 3 / 6) Galβ(1 - 4) GlcNAcβ(1 - 2) (sialyl LacNAc) on the liver proteins in both cancer-bearing murine models compared to control livers. The expression of this specific glycan motif on the liver cell membrane of mice bearing two different distal cancers suggests that this glycan motif may serve as a marker for tumour-induced liver inflammation in the mouse. The differential expression of the enzymes in the glycosylation pathway and the corresponding glycan products observed on the liver membrane glycoproteins of EHS-bearing and C 26 -bearing mice strongly suggests that glycosylation of liver membrane proteins plays a role in the systemic inflammatory responses in the liver to the presence of distal cancers.

40|$|Boyd, E. FidelmaVibrio vulnificus is a Gram-negative, rod shaped, Gammaproteobacteria, {{found in}} estuarine and coastal waters {{throughout}} the world. V. vulnificus {{is a disease}} causing agent in fish and humans. It causes a severe and rapid septicemia, contracted primarily through raw oyster consumption, with a mortality rate of over 50 % in susceptible individuals. The mechanisms by which V. vulnificus colonizes the host gastrointestinal tract and survives and proliferates in the host bloodstream are poorly understood. Sialic <b>acids</b> (<b>neuraminic</b> <b>acids)</b> also known as nonulosonic acids, are a diverse family of nine carbon amino sugars, {{the most common and}} widely studied being N -acetylneuraminic acid, or Neu 5 Ac. Crucial to cell to cell communication and self-recognition in metazoans, sialic acids are typically positioned at the terminal end of glycoconjugates allowing them to interact with the external environment. The self-recognition function of sialic acid {{has been shown to be}} crucial as a modulator of immune function. Sialic acid is also a major component of mucin and thus is found throughout the mucosal layer of the gastrointestinal tract of mammalian species. Bacteria have the ability to catabolize sialic acids as a sole carbon, nitrogen and energy source. This ability is overwhelmingly confined to commensal and pathogen species, where it has been shown to confer a competitive advantage in the host environment. Within bacteria, the ability to synthesize sialic acid has been demonstrated in a number of human pathogens and is phylogenetically widespread through diverse lineages. In addition to the canonical Neu 5 Ac, bacterial specific sialic acid-like molecules, legionaminic acid, and pseudaminic acid, are known. Several organisms relevant in human disease have been shown to decorate their surfaces with sialic acid to aid in host colonization and avoidance of immune responses. Preliminary investigations revealed that V. vulnificus could catabolize sialic acid and that disruption in this pathway lead to defects in intestinal colonization. It was also determined that V. vulnificus contained a putative sialic acid biosynthetic gene cluster. We hypothesized that sialic acid catabolism in V. vulnificus plays an important role in this organism's pathogenicity. We also believed that V. vulnificus utilizes sialic acid biosynthesis to decorate its cell surface, promoting survival in the host bloodstream. Initial genomic analysis of V. vulnificus clinical strains found the sialic acid catabolism (SAC) and transport (SAT) cluster present on chromosome II, and unlike Vibrio cholerae, is not associated with a pathogenicity island. However, the region was present predominantly among lineage I of V. vulnificus, which is comprised mainly of clinical isolates. We demonstrated that the isolates that contain this region can catabolize sialic acid as a sole carbon source and that the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter SiaPQM is essential for sialic acid uptake. Expression analysis of the SAT and SAC genes indicates that sialic acid is an inducer of expression. Overall, our study demonstrates that the ability to catabolize and transport sialic acid is predominately lineage specific in V. vulnificus, found predominantly in genotypically clinical isolates. Next we investigated the distribution, diversity and function of sialic acid biosynthesis in V. vulnificus. We found that 44 % of the Vibrionaceae species examined contained sialic acid biosynthetic (nab) clusters. Evidence of duplication, divergence, horizontal transfer, and recombination was widespread in this region and biochemical analyses confirmed production of di-N -acetylated sialic acid-like sugars. V. vulnificus clinical isolates CMCP 6 and YJ 016, were found to contain two highly divergent clusters. PCR genotyping found the CMCP 6 -like cluster to be found overwhelmingly in the clinical, lineage I, isolates. Isolates containing the CMCP 6 -like alleles produced 40 -fold higher levels of sialic acids than YJ 016 -like alleles associated with environmental isolates. Studies into the functional significance of biosynthesis in V. vulnificus found the LPS to be decorated with sialic acid residues. Expression of sialic acid was found to be is required for optimal motility, flagellar formation and biofilm formation. Competition experiments in a mouse model of septicemia reveal a significant 300 -fold decrease in survival of the sialic acid synthase (nab 2) mutant strain versus the CMCP 6 wild type. Competition experiments conducted in the YJ 016 background, which produces less sialic acid, revealed significantly less attenuation in the mutant strain when compared to CMCP 6. In summary, these data demonstrate a key biological function of sialic acid molecules in V. vulnificus and provides insight on how this species survives in the host bloodstream.

5000|$|Sialic acid is {{a generic}} {{term for the}} N- or O-substituted {{derivatives}} of <b>neuraminic</b> <b>acid,</b> a monosaccharide with a nine-carbon backbone. [...] It is also the name for the most common member of this group, N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac or NANA). Sialic acids are found widely distributed in animal tissues {{and to a lesser}} extent in other organisms, ranging from plants and fungi to yeasts and bacteria, mostly in glycoproteins and gangliosides (they occur at the end of sugar chains connected to the surfaces of cells and soluble proteins). That is because it seems to have appeared late in evolution. However, it has been observed in Drosophila embryos and other insects and in the capsular polysaccharides of certain strains of bacteria. In humans the brain has the highest sialic acid concentration, where these acids play an important role in neural transmission and ganglioside structure in synaptogenesis. [...] In general, the amino group bears either an acetyl or a glycolyl group, but other modifications have been described. These modifications along with linkages have shown to be tissue specific and developmentally regulated expressions, so some of them are only found on certain types of glycoconjugates in specific cells. The hydroxyl substituents may vary considerably; acetyl, lactyl, methyl, sulfate, and phosphate groups have been found. [...] The term [...] "sialic acid" [...] (from the Greek for saliva, σίαλον/sialon) was first introduced by Swedish biochemist Gunnar Blix in 1952.|$|E
