25|$|The Women's Movement and Civil Rights Movement {{during the}} 1950s and 1960s in the United States profoundly shaped {{the future of}} Emory University. Formerly an all-male school, Emory officially became a coeducational {{institution}} in 1953. Although it had previously admitted women under limited circumstances, the university had <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>had</b> a policy through which they could enroll in large numbers and as resident students. In 1959, sororities first appeared on campus. In 1962, {{in the midst of}} the Civil Rights Movement, Emory embraced the initiative to end racial restrictions when it asked the courts to declare portions of the Georgia statutes unconstitutional. Previously, Georgia law denied tax-exempt status to private universities with racially integrated student bodies. The Supreme Court of Georgia ruled in Emory's favor and Emory officially became racially integrated. Marvin S. Arrington, Sr. was Emory University's first, full-time African American student and graduated from Emory University School of Law in 1967.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} centuries, Klagenfurt suffered fires, earthquakes, invasions of locusts, and attacks from Turks, and was ravaged by the Peasants' Wars. In 1514, a fire almost completely destroyed the city, and in 1518 Emperor Maximilian I, unable to rebuild it, despite the loud protests of the burgers, ceded Klagenfurt to the Estates, the nobility of the Duchy. <b>Never</b> <b>before</b> <b>had</b> {{such a thing}} happened. The new owners, however, brought about an economic renaissance and the political and cultural ascendancy of Klagenfurt. A canal was dug to connect {{the city to the}} lake as a supply route for timber to rebuild the city and to feed the city's new moats; the noble families had their town houses built in the duchy's new capital, the city was enlarged along a geometrical chequer-board lay-out according to the Renaissance ideas of the Italian architect Domenico dell'Allio; a new city centre square, the Neuer Platz, was constructed; and the new fortifications that took half a century to build made Klagenfurt the strongest fortress north of the Alps.|$|E
25|$|A {{prolonged}} thirteen-year {{political and}} legal battle, Figueroa v. Canada ensued, which won the support of widespread popular opinion, reflected {{in a number of}} members of parliament openly supporting the challenge and other small political parties joining the case, most notably the Green Party. <b>Never</b> <b>before</b> <b>had</b> a single court challenge resulted in legislative action on three separate occasions to amend a standing law. Bill C-2 (2000) amended the Canada Elections Act to (among other things) remove the unconstitutional seizure of party assets for failure to field 50 candidates in a general election and provided for the full refund of candidates’ deposits. The party had its deregistration overturned and its seized assets restored. Bill C-9 (2001) reduced the threshold from 50 to 12 candidates for the party identifier to appear on the ballot. Bill C-3 (2003) scrapped the 50-candidate rule altogether for party registration. This victory was celebrated by many of the other small parties – regardless of political differences – on the principle that it was a victory for the people's right to democratic choice.|$|E

25|$|Because the Pill was so effective, {{and soon}} so widespread, it also {{heightened}} {{the debate about}} the moral and health consequences of pre-marital sex and promiscuity. <b>Never</b> <b>before</b> <b>had</b> sexual activity been so divorced from reproduction. For a couple using the Pill, intercourse became purely an expression of love, or a means of physical pleasure, or both; but it was no longer a means of reproduction. While this was true of previous contraceptives, their relatively high failure rates and their less widespread use failed to emphasize this distinction as clearly as did the Pill. The spread of oral contraceptive use thus led many religious figures and institutions to debate the proper role of sexuality and its relationship to procreation. The Roman Catholic Church in particular, after studying the phenomenon of oral contraceptives, re-emphasized the stated teaching on birth control in the 1968 papal encyclical Humanae vitae. The encyclical reiterated the established Catholic teaching that artificial contraception distorts the nature and purpose of sex. On the other side Anglican and other Protestant churches, such as the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) accepted the combined oral contraceptive pill.|$|E
25|$|In Otello, {{the flow}} between the set pieces is much {{smoother}} {{than in any}} of Verdi's earlier works. Whereas in his earlier masterpieces he had made significant strides away from the aria-recitative structure, here Verdi did away with it entirely. Verdi's librettist, Arrigo Boito, was extremely faithful to Shakespeare's original play, though act 1 of the drama (everything {{having to do with}} Brabantio, Desdemona's father) was omitted and the other scenes were condensed in length. The roles of Otello (Othello) and Iago are among the most fully developed in all of opera, as much so as in Shakespeare's original drama—especially the character of Otello himself. (Iago is much more a standard villain in the opera than in the play). Verdi's orchestral writing in Otello is more highly developed than in any of Verdi's previous masterpieces. Though the orchestra plays a significant role in his earlier works, <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>had</b> Verdi, or Italian opera in general, been so daring and complex in orchestration. Throughout the score instances of dissonance appear, and Otello's entrance is marked by a cluster chord made of C–C–D. It has been argued that Otello was influenced by Richard Wagner's work, whereas others believe it was pitted directly against it.|$|E
25|$|The Australian {{newspaper}} reported that <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>had</b> an Australian XI led by Ian Chappell been so humiliated in defeat. Australia had started well reducing the West Indies to 119–7. But Clive Lloyd {{as he had}} done so often before, resisted scoring a vital 56, aputting on 40 runs for the last wicket with the capable Wayne Daniel (17*). Chappell was delighted with his bowlers performance on a first day that closed with Australia 33/2, Ian out along with Bruce Laird and brother Trevor retired hurt. Twelve wickets would fall on the second day, Australia were bowled out for just 106, the four pronged West Indian attack making mince-meat of the Aussie batting card. With a lead of 76 the West Indies batted positively, compiling a total of 481 at a remarkable run rate of 4.39 runs per over. Clive Lloyd was again the star scoring a brilliant 197 before being the eighth batsman dismissed. Requiring an unlikely 558 runs to win in their second innings, the aggressive Ian Chappell chose to open the batting, protecting Trevor from the new ball. Ian made 41 but his side were only 83–4 at his dismissal and {{on the verge of a}} crushing defeat. Ray Bright made a good 47 not out, but the Australian tail were blown away by the four quicks, complemented by the medium pace of Richard Austin. The West Indies completed a 369 run win on the fourth day.|$|E

[...] The full, electric rock band treatment that the Byrds and producer Terry Melcher {{had given the}} song effectively created the template for the musical subgenre of folk rock. [...] McGuinn's melodic, jangling twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar playing—which was heavily compressed to produce an extremely bright and sustained tone—was immediately influential and has remained so to the present day. [...] The single also featured another major characteristic of the band's sound: their clear harmony singing, which usually featured McGuinn and Clark in unison, with Crosby providing the high harmony. [...] Additionally, Richie Unterberger has noted that the song's abstract lyrics took rock and pop songwriting to new heights; <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>had</b> such intellectual and literary wordplay been combined with rock instrumentation by a popular music group.|$|E
500|$|That {{is not to}} say his operas did {{not come}} as great innovations.

No longer was there the empty vocal display of the bel canto period composers. Granted, there is a significant amount of vocal fireworks, but they exist for the purpose of drama, not to show off singers. Aside from this, his use of the chorus was entirely new. Before Nabucco, an opera's chorus was limited to be only a background voice, another instrument. In Nabucco, this is abolished; he uses the chorus as character, to show the suffering and consensus of the people. The famous [...] "Va, pensiero" [...] is an example of this.|$|E
