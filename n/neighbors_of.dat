5|$|During {{the early}} 1020s, Maymandi urged Mahmud to invade Jibal, {{which was then}} {{under the control of}} the young Buyid ruler Majd al-Dawla. However, the real ruler of the region was Majd al-Dawla's mother Sayyida Shirin, which was already known by the <b>neighbors</b> <b>of</b> the Buyids, {{including}} the Ghaznavids. Mahmud, however, did not agree with him, because he did not feel his empire threatened because of a woman ruling in the region.|$|E
5|$|According to Béla Miklós Szőke's theory, the {{detailed}} description of the Magyars by western contemporary sources and the immediate Hungarian intervention in local wars give the presumption that the Hungarians had already lived on the eastern territories of the Carpathian Basin since the middle of the 9th century. Regarding the right location of early Hungarian settlements, the Arabic geographer al-Jayhani (only snippets of his work survived in other Muslim authors' papers) in the 870s placed the Hungarians between Don and Danube rivers. Szőke identifies al-Jayhani's Danube with the middle Danube region, as opposed to the previously assumed lower Danube region, because following al-Jayhani's description the Christian Moravians were the western <b>neighbors</b> <b>of</b> the Magyars.|$|E

5|$|As {{the first}} group of Chinese people to settle in large numbers, the Hokkien of {{southern}} Fujian became the dominant immigrant group until the middle of the 19th century. Their maritime-mercantile culture comes from their trade occupations whilst in Indonesia. Descendants of Hokkiens are the dominant group in eastern Indonesia, Central and East Java, and the western coast of Sumatra. Teochews, southern <b>neighbors</b> <b>of</b> the Hokkien, are found throughout the eastern coast of Sumatra, in the Riau Archipelago, and in western Borneo. They were preferred as plantation laborers in Sumatra, but have become traders in regions where the Hokkien are not well represented.|$|E
5|$|The {{main idea}} of the {{algorithm}} is to find pairs of clusters to merge by following paths in the nearest neighbor graph of the clusters. Every such path will eventually terminate at a pair of clusters that are nearest <b>neighbors</b> <b>of</b> each other, and the algorithm chooses that pair of clusters as the pair to merge. In order to save work by re-using {{as much as possible}} of each path, the algorithm uses a stack data structure to keep track of each path that it follows. By following paths in this way, the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm merges its clusters in a different order than methods that always find and merge the closest pair of clusters. However, despite that difference, it always generates the same hierarchy of clusters.|$|E
5|$|O'Malley {{obtained}} commitments {{from over}} 80 prospective Park Grill investors, {{including some of}} Mayor Daley's friends and neighbors. Each share of the restaurant cost investors $200,000. Among the investors are Daley's friend Fred Barbara, a nephew of the late Chicago Alderman Fred Roti. Barbara has ties to the Hired Truck Program scandal and the blue bag recycling controversy. Other investors include relatives of Daley's political adviser Timothy Degnan, two <b>neighbors</b> <b>of</b> the mayor, Ray Chin, an O'Hare Airport contractor, and Rick Simon, a controversial figure who runs a janitorial business {{and sits on the}} board of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau. Also among the investors was Daley's cousin Theresa E. Mintle, then the Chicago Transit Authority’s director of governmental affairs and former congressman Morgan F. Murphy, who has had business dealings with convicted labor union official John Serpico. Among the vendors for Park Grill was an architectural metal company owned by the son of then Chicago Alderman Burton Natarus (42nd).|$|E

25|$|An edge connects {{vertices}} x and y in {{the graph}} (where x<nbsp&y) whenever the xth {{bit of the}} binary representation of y is nonzero. Thus, for instance, the <b>neighbors</b> <b>of</b> vertex 0 consist of all odd-numbered vertices, because the numbers whose 0th bit is nonzero are exactly the odd numbers. The <b>neighbors</b> <b>of</b> vertex 1 consist of vertex 0 (previously identified because 1 is odd) and all vertices with numbers congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 4 (because those are exactly the numbers with a nonzero bit at index 1), every {{one of which is}} greater than 1.|$|E
