5|$|A large {{army was}} {{assembled}} slowly and marched into Scotland. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> no pitched battle ever attempted, but the king {{did not try}} and besiege Scotland's capital, Edinburgh.

The campaign ultimately accomplished little except to further deplete the king's coffers, and is historically notable only for being the last one led by an English king on Scottish soil.|$|E

5|$|Britain was {{the world}} leader in the {{construction}} of railways, and their use to expand trade and coal supplies. The first successful locomotive-powered line in Scotland, between Monkland and Kirkintilloch, opened in 1831. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> good passenger service established by the late 1840s, but an excellent network of freight lines reduce the cost of shipping coal, and made products manufactured in Scotland competitive throughout Britain. For example, railways opened the London market to Scottish beef and milk. They enabled the Aberdeen Angus to become a cattle breed of worldwide reputation.|$|E

5|$|Initial public {{reaction}} to the May 18 eruption dealt a nearly crippling blow to tourism, an important industry in Washington. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> tourism down in the Mount St. Helens–Gifford Pinchot National Forest area, but conventions, meetings and social gatherings also were cancelled or postponed at cities and resorts elsewhere in Washington and neighboring Oregon not affected by the eruption. The adverse effect on tourism and conventioneering, however, proved only temporary. Mount St. Helens, perhaps because of its reawakening, has regained its appeal for tourists. The United States Forest Service and the State of Washington opened visitor centers and provided access for people to view the volcano's devastation.|$|E

However physicist Jean-Antoine Nollet (1700–1770), a skeptic who had published his own theory on electricity, declared Franklin's ideas were wrong. He claimed in 1753 that Franklin's lightning rod was not only dangerous but useless and would attract lightning bolts to wooden buildings, causing them to be hit more often. Franklin in time proved to the scientific community that his lightning rod invention <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> a protective device, but it {{also served as a}} preventive way to divert destructive lightning bolts away from hitting buildings.|$|E

5|$|The Haraldskær Woman (or Haraldskjaer Woman) is a bog {{body of a}} woman found {{naturally}} {{preserved in}} a bog in Jutland, Denmark, and dating from about 490 BC (pre-Roman Iron Age). Workers found the body in 1835 while excavating peat on the Haraldskær Estate. The anaerobic conditions and acids of the peat bog contributed to the body's excellent preservation. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> the intact skeleton found, but so were the skin and internal organs. Scientists settled disputes about the age and identity of this well preserved body in 1977, when radiocarbon dating determined conclusively that the woman's death occurred around the 5th century BC.|$|E
5|$|The Stuarts {{used their}} {{connection}} with Fleance and {{his marriage to}} the Welsh princess to claim a genealogical link with the legendary King Arthur. This, they hoped, would strengthen the legitimacy of their claim to the throne. In 1722, however, Richard Hay, a Scottish historian, presented strong evidence that <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> James not a descendant of Fleance, but also that neither Fleance nor Banquo ever even existed. Most modern scholars now agree that Fleance is not a real historical figure.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuation}} of Octel Freight Traffic until 1993 ensured that <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> the trackbed kept whole, {{but the majority}} of the rail infrastructure was still in situ. As such, the Amlwch line was well suited to preservation as a heritage railway, or see a return of mainline services. The continued role of Llangefni as an administrative and commercial centre led British Rail and Gwynedd County Council to consider restoring passenger services between Llangefni and Bangor in the late 1980s, but the idea was turned down.|$|E

5|$|The {{draft was}} then {{transferred}} by pencil on white-primed panels of hardwood end grain. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> it hard work, {{but the quality}} of the printing block was crucial. Everything left white on the block, around Busch's drawn lines, was cut from the plate by skilled engravers. Wood engraving allows a finer differentiation than woodcut and the potential tonal values are of almost the quality of intaglio printing, such as copper engraving. Sometimes the result was not satisfactory, leading Busch to rework or reproduce plates. The wood engraving technique did not allow for fine lines, which is why Busch's drawing, especially in his illustrated tales up to the mid-1870s, are boldly drawn, giving his work its particular characteristic.|$|E
5|$|The {{era of the}} Kingdom of Mysore is {{considered}} a golden age {{in the development of}} Kannada literature. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> the Mysore court adorned by famous Brahmin and Veerashaiva writers and composers, the kings themselves were accomplished in the fine arts and made important contributions. While conventional literature in philosophy and religion remained popular, writings in new genres such as chronicle, biography, history, encyclopedia, novel, drama, and musical treatise became popular. A native form of folk literature with dramatic representation called Yakshagana gained popularity. A remarkable development of the later period was the influence of English literature and classical Sanskrit literature on Kannada.|$|E

Notwithstanding, Marx has run successful tours with several artists during the first quarter.|$|E
