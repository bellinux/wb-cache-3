500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again" [...] {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, David Browne called it [...] "ludicrously derivative" [...] of Spears' debut single [...] "...Baby One More Time", and commented that it [...] "amounts to <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> jailbait manifesto". Lennat Mak of the Asian division of MTV complimented the song as [...] "a perfect 10 on the [...] "wow" [...] scale, with the wacky [...] "Jack-Rose" [...] dialogue", referencing the Titanic spoken lyrics.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to Tchaikovsky's {{music has}} also varied but also improved over time. Even after 1880, some inside Russia held it suspect {{for not being}} nationalistic enough and thought Western European critics lauded it for exactly that reason. There {{might have been a}} grain of truth in the latter, according to musicologist and conductor Leon Botstein, as German critics especially wrote of the [...] "indeterminacy of [...] artistic character ... being truly at home in the non-Russian." [...] Of the foreign critics who did not care for his music, Eduard Hanslick lambasted the Violin Concerto as a musical composition [...] "whose stink one can hear" [...] and William Forster Abtrop wrote of the Fifth Symphony, [...] "The furious peroration sounds like <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> horde of demons struggling in a torrent of brandy, the music growing drunker and drunker. Pandemonium, delerium tremens, raving, and above all, noise worse confounded!" ...|$|E
500|$|By 1982, fantasy {{films such}} as The Beastmaster and Conan the Barbarian had proven {{successful}} at the box office, and Bakshi {{wanted to work with}} his long-time friend, the fantasy illustrator Frank Frazetta. Fire and Ice was financed by some of American Pops investors for $1.2 million, while 20th Century Fox agreed to distribute. Fire and Ice was the most action-oriented story Bakshi had directed, so he again used rotoscoping; the realism of the design and rotoscoped animation replicated Frazetta's artwork. Bakshi and Frazetta were heavily involved in the production of the live-action sequences, from casting sessions to the final shoot. The film's crew included background artists James Gurney and Thomas Kinkade, layout artist Peter Chung, and established Bakshi Productions artists Sparey, Steve Gordon, Bell and Banks. Chung greatly admired Bakshi's and Frazetta's work, and animated his sequences while working for The Walt Disney Company. The film was given a limited release, and was financially unsuccessful. Andrew Leal wrote, [...] "The plot is standard [...] recalling <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> more graphic episode of Filmation's He-Man series. [...] Fire and Ice essentially stands as a footnote to the spate of barbarian films that followed in the wake of Arnold Schwarzenegger's appearance as Conan." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{blend of}} various movie genres such as martial arts, mystery, costume drama and horror {{attracted}} certain amounts of criticism. In particular, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote [...] "This new take on horror {{is more of}} the bloody same" [...] whereas Stephen Hunter of Washington Post {{said that it is}} [...] "a mad agglomeration of styles and traditions that ultimately results in <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mad agglomeration of styles and traditions." [...] ultimately awarding the film a 0.5/4 score.|$|E

60|$|To {{the little}} {{world of the}} little city {{of which he was}} now an habitant Vivian Grey did not appear a broken-hearted man. He lived neither as a recluse nor a misanthrope. He became {{extremely}} addicted to field sports, especially to hunting the wild boar; for he feared <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> thought, and dreaded <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the solitude of his own chamber. He was an early riser to escape from hideous dreams; and at break of dawn he wandered among the wild passes of the Bergstrasse; or, climbing a lofty ridge, was a watcher for the rising sun; and in the evening he sailed upon the star-lit Neckar.|$|R
60|$|As if {{the wolf}} understood, {{he lifted his}} white, sharp head and uttered a bark or howl that was like <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> haunting, unearthly mourn.

60|$|The old man glided away, stooping, stealthy, cat-like, {{and brought}} the low bench. He seated himself upon it, half his body in the dim and {{flickering}} light, {{and the other half}} in shadow; and so, with his craving eyes bent upon the slumbering boy, he kept his patient vigil there, heedless of the drift of time, and softly whetted his knife, and mumbled and chuckled; and in aspect and attitude he resembled <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> grizzly, monstrous spider, gloating over some hapless insect that lay bound and helpless in his web.|$|E
60|$|And so he sat {{for half}} an hour at least, {{although}} Dolly, in the most endearing of manners, hoped, a dozen times, that he was not angry with her. So he sat {{for half an}} hour, quite motionless, and looking all the while like <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> great Dutch Pin or Skittle. At the expiration of that period, he suddenly, and without the least notice, burst (to the great consternation of the young people) into a very loud and very short laugh; and repeating, 'Certainly, Joseph. Oh yes! Why not?' went out for a walk.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a strange}} thing, to watch these {{conspicuous}} forms toiling up the hillside, dodging {{this way and that}} way, as the bullets cut into the earth around them; but with the experience of the previous ten minutes fresh in the memory, pity was not one of the emotions it aroused. A good many fell, subsiding peacefully, and lying quite still. Their fall was greeted by strange little yells of pleasure from the native soldiers. These Afridi and Pathan companies of the Guides Infantry suggest <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> well-trained pack of hounds. Their cries, their movements, and their natures are similar.|$|E
