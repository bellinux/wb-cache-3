50|$|CD28 also {{contains}} two proline-rich motifs that {{are able to}} bind SH3-containing proteins. Itk and Tec are able to bind to the N-terminal of these two motifs which immediately succeeds the Y170 YMNM; Lck binds the C-terminal. Both Itk and Lck are able to phosphorylate the tyrosine residues which then allow binding of SH2 containing proteins to CD28. Binding of Tec to CD28 enhances IL-2 production, dependent on binding of its SH3 and PH domains to CD28 and PIP3 respectively. The C-terminal proline-rich motif in CD28 is important for bringing Lck and lipid rafts into the immune synapse via filamin-A. Mutation of the two prolines within the C-terminal motif results in reduced proliferation and IL-2 production but <b>normal</b> <b>induction</b> of Bcl-xL. Phosphorylation of a tyrosine within the PYAP motif (Y191 in the mature human CD28) forms a high affinity-binding site for the SH2 domain of the src kinase Lck which in turn binds to the serine kinase PKC-θ.|$|E

The efficiency of the induction motor was increased by 5 % by adding nanocomposites of SiO 2 and TiO 2 (1 : 3) to the enamel used as the coating for the windings of the three phase squirrel cage induction motor. Heat run test was performed on electrical machines to determine the total loss of energy dissipated as heat. The addition of nanocomposites to the enamel has increased the temperature withstanding capacity of the induction motor.

40|$|Mutagenesis at 3,N 4 -ethenocytosine (epsilonC), a nonpairing {{mutagenic}} lesion, {{is significantly}} enhanced in Escherichia coli cells pretreated with UV, alkylating agents, or H 2 O 2. This effect, termed UVM (for UV modulation of mutagenesis), {{is distinct from}} known DNA damage-inducible responses, such as the SOS response, the adaptive response to alkylating agents, or the oxyR-mediated response to oxidative agents. Here, we have addressed the hypothesis that UVM results from transient depletion of a mismatch repair activity that normally acts to reduce mutagenesis. To test whether the loss of mismatch repair activities results in the predicted constitutive UVM phenotype, E. coli cells defective for methyl-directed mismatch repair, for very-short-patch repair, or for the N-glycosylase activities MutY and MutM were treated with the UVM-inducing agent 1 -methyl- 3 -nitro- 1 -nitrosoguanidine, with subsequent transfection of M 13 viral single-stranded DNA bearing a site-specific epsilonC lesion. Survival of the M 13 DNA was measured as transfection efficiency, and mutation fixation at the lesion was characterized by multiplex sequencing technology. The results showed <b>normal</b> UVM <b>induction</b> patterns in all the repair-defective strains tested.

To elucidate the role of PDGF and bFGF in vivo, equimolar concentrations of recombinant PDGF-BB or bFGF or vehicle were infused intravenously into rats over a 7 -d period. Rats were either nonmanipulated ("normals") or had received a subnephritogenic dose of anti-MC antibody ("anti-Thy 1. 1 rats") before the infusion period. Glomerular cell proliferation (anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunostaining) on days 2, 4, and 7 was unchanged in vehicle-infused normals or anti-Thy 1. 1 rats. PDGF infusion increased glomerular cell proliferation 32 -fold in anti-Thy 1. 1 rats and an 11 -fold in normals on day 2. bFGF increased glomerular cell proliferation fourfold in anti-Thy 1. 1 rats but was ineffective in <b>normals.</b> <b>Induction</b> of cell proliferation in all kidneys was limited to the glomerulus. The majority of proliferating cells were identified as MC by double immunolabeling. No significant proteinuria, glomerular leukocyte, or platelet influx developed in any group. Glomerular matrix expansion with increased deposition of type IV collagen, laminin, and fibronectin, as well as upregulated laminin and collagen IV mRNA expression was confined to PDGF-infused anti-Thy 1. 1 rats. These results show that PDGF and, to a lesser degree, bFGF are selective MC mitogens in vivo and that previous subclinical injury can enhance this MC response.

Here, we demonstrate that cyclic AMP (cAMP) -dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is essential during limb development to prevent inappropriate dpp and wg expression. We also show that a constitutively active form of PKA can prevent inappropriate dpp and wg expression, but does not interfere with their <b>normal</b> <b>induction</b> by hh.

This observation establishes significance for this process in tumour development, but it does little to elucidate {{the nature of this}} role, nor does it yield information relevant to the early stages of carcinogenesis.

Using this strategy, a number of genetic lesions have been identified which affect both the apoptotic pathway and predisposition to malignancy. These lesions can operate either directly, by blocking the induction of apoptosis; or indirectly, by increasing the selective pressure for further genetic change. The consequent deregulation of growth control and increase in mutation burden represent two key steps in carcinogenesis, underlining the pivotal role played in tumour suppression by the <b>normal</b> <b>induction</b> of apoptosis...|$|E

This antibody recognizes RNA, single-stranded DNA, and nucleosomes. We show that B cells expressing this immunoglobulin were activated, producing class-switched autoantibody in vivo despite the apparently <b>normal</b> <b>induction</b> of anergy. This autoantibody production was largely dependent on Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR 7). We further show that production of these autoantibodies was sufficient to cause kidney pathology in these mice.
