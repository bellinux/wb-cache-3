40|$|The {{cultural}} content of advertising, its language and its connection with gender issues are {{deeply rooted in}} our society. Language <b>and</b> <b>gender</b> are significant issues that remain widely controversial {{in the domain of}} advertising. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the language of advertising in <b>Persian</b> <b>and</b> English in order to estimate the specificities of the advertising genre in the two different cultural and linguistic systems. The approach employed in the study draws on the ideas of the functionalist interpretation of text typology and source text analysis as proposed by Nord (1997) and Reiss (2000). Besides, it seeks to understand the role of advertising and how it affects the culturally <b>gendered</b> stereotypes, <b>and</b> how each society portrays the image of women compared to that of men. To achieve these objectives, forty advertisements of six magazines were analyzed. The analysis revealed that Persian magazine advertisements share some similar structural discourse strategies with English advertisements. Moreover, differences in culturally gendered stereotypes between these contexts were identified. Key words: language <b>and</b> <b>gender,</b> discourse of advertisin...|$|R

Like many other Turkic languages, Uyghur displays vowel harmony and agglutination, lacks noun classes or grammatical <b>gender,</b> <b>and</b> is a left-branching language with subject–object–verb word order.

In addition to influence of other Turkic languages, Uyghur has historically been influenced strongly by <b>Persian</b> <b>and</b> Arabic, and more recently by Mandarin Chinese and Russian.|$|R

40|$|A lot {{of poets}} entered the {{prison in the}} history of the Arab <b>and</b> <b>Persian</b> literature; for various reasons, {{including}} political, ideological, religious and other, and tasted imprisonment and captivity. They registered, by their expressive abilities, their painful and difficult moments they have experienced. Because the <b>Persian</b> <b>and</b> Arabic Alhabsiaat have its special nature of the various aspects such as contents, descriptions, fictional images, literary elements and others, they need research with the utmost precision. This paper presents the virtual conditions of the prison and its Interior conditions in the <b>Persian</b> <b>and</b> Arab Habsiaat literature; such as (shackles, prisoners, the warden and others). The poet in the <b>Persian</b> <b>and</b> Arabic Alhabsiaat includes verses expressing his inner feelings talking about his innocence, freedom, sorrow and grief, and so on. This paper examines the descriptive implications in the <b>Persian</b> <b>and</b> Arabic Alhabsaat, which could be considered both (virtual description of the prison and the description of the inner feelings) in order to clarify the literary side of the prison poems in <b>Persian</b> <b>and</b> Arabic literature...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper investigates {{inflection}} and inflectional {{features in}} the category of preposition in Italian and how Iranian language learners, learning Italian as a foreign language, deal with it. The analysis of different forms of inflected prepositions, the types of errors and their classification leads to the findings that: the prepositions in Italian language agree with their noun complement in number, person <b>and</b> <b>gender,</b> a feature not available in Persian, which causes some difficulties for Iranian language learners. The analysis of students’ errors indicates two types of errors occurred mostly: addition and deletion. The research emphasizes the pedagogical implications for teaching prepositions in Italian language to help teachers and motivate them to take into consideration this typological difference between <b>Persian</b> <b>and</b> Italian in the use of prepositions...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{illuminate}} the differences between <b>Persian</b> <b>and</b> English in online headlines in terms of applying metadiscourse markers in the first two months of the year 2015. To fulfill this purpose, 100 <b>Persian</b> <b>and</b> English online headlines (each 50 headlines) were chosen randomly from English <b>and</b> <b>Persian</b> newscasts such as VOA, CNN, Bistosi (20 : 30), and Bashgahkhabarnegaran.
