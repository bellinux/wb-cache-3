The transmission can accommodate more power than the maximum output of the engines; however two aircraft were lost in 2012 due to the cracking of the bevel gear shaft, a gearbox component. In response, the design of the transmission was modified in 2013, and the onboard health and usage monitoring system (HUMS) was upgraded to provide real-time monitoring of the bevel gear shaft against the threat of crack formation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For the {{environment}} of using the <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> and its requirement, a distributed fault monitoring system on the <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> is designed. The three-layer structure with slave station and master station and Voyage Data Recorder is employed in the system, which can monitor broken wire fault, short circuit fault and power failure on <b>navigation</b> <b>lights.</b> The mature RS 485 communication circuit is adopted in communication interface not only between the master and the slave, but also between the master and VDR (Voyage Data Recorder). The master station gets the information of all <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> from the slave stations, and sends these received data to VDR after being processed. The system has been successfully applied in practice, and can effectively monitor {{the state of the}} <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> and give the alarm information when in fault. In addition, the monitoring system can quickly and accurately trace the fault position and type, so the <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> can be maintain timely...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we {{designed}} and fabricated LED <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> which can replace the existing ones immediately and overcome disadvantages due {{to use of}} conventional lamps. To decide the best arrangement and position of a LED module, optical systems of existing <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> were analyzed and refracted routes of rays were simulated. The electrical and optical characteristics of the fabricated LED <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> were measured and analyzed with a goniophotometer. To calculate ranges of visibility, the vertical and horizontal luminous intensity distributions were evaluated {{in accordance with the}} COLREGs (convention on the international regulation for preventing collisions at Sea). From the results, the proposed LED <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> showed suitable characteristics for marine environment with the power consumption reduced by 90 % and the maximum luminous intensity increased by 20 % compare...|$|R

40|$|This report provides,the {{results from}} a study to {{determine}} possible uses of fiber optical light guides for remote source lighting for the Texas Department of Transportation. Fiber light guides are currently used within the Department for changeable message signs and signal heads. The investigation primarily considered its use for street, tunnel, and <b>navigation</b> <b>lighting.</b> The information in the report could help the designer for specific lighting configurations. The study as {{will be discussed in}} the report, has basically concluded that fiber optics for remote source lighting has many possibilities for transportation related needs and in fact are currently being implemented for changeable message signs and signal heads. However, the technology still requires additional irr~provements or breakthroughs for efficient usage before {{the full extent of the}} technology can be realized for the specif~c appl~cation areas investigated. 17.
