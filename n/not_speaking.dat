5|$|In 2011, Kalam was criticised {{by civil}} groups over his {{stand on the}} Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant; he {{supported}} {{the establishment of the}} nuclear power plant and was accused of <b>not</b> <b>speaking</b> with the local people. The protesters were hostile to his visit as they saw him as a pro-nuclear scientist and were unimpressed by the assurances he provided regarding the safety features of the plant.|$|E
5|$|Catherine Rottenberg {{argues that}} Larsen’s novella {{is a prime}} example of race and gender norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their {{struggle}} with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers understand the difference between gender and race norms. These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare and Irene by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of <b>not</b> <b>speaking.</b> Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare for her to get back in touch with her African-American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with her need to feel safe and in control in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation.|$|E

5|$|Dynamic editing {{contributed to}} the surrealistic nature of the episode. Abrupt cuts from {{close-up}} to extreme wide angles and sudden shifts from normal speed to super slow-motion are used in Buffy's dream: several sequences become slow-motion partway through them, then revert to normal speed as they continue. Xander's dream features mismatches between sound and image: characters are sometimes shown <b>not</b> <b>speaking</b> even as their voices are heard. Additionally, silence is used frequently, to both reflect the characters' disorientation and to unsettle the audience. Whedon cited films by Steven Soderbergh as his main inspirations for the odd editing, especially The Limey and The Underneath. He also listed Orson Welles' version of The Trial and Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut as inspirations for many of his shooting and editing decisions.|$|E
5|$|States sent Union regiments {{south in}} {{response}} to Lincoln's call to save the capital and confront the rebellion. On April 19, mobs in Baltimore, which controlled the rail links, attacked Union troops who were changing trains, and local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital. The Army responded by arresting local Maryland officials. Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach Washington. John Merryman, a Maryland official involved in hindering the U.S. troop movements, petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice and Marylander, Roger B. Taney, author of the controversial pro-slavery Dred Scott opinion, to issue a writ of habeas corpus, and in June Taney, acting as a circuit judge and <b>not</b> <b>speaking</b> for the Supreme Court, issued the writ, because in his opinion only Congress could suspend the writ. Lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the Ex parte Merryman ruling.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, Grace {{moves with}} Leo to Rome and lives {{there for a}} year. They then move back to New York City, where they raise their daughter, Laila. Will and Vince D'Angelo (Bobby Cannavale) have since reconciled, and are raising a son, Ben. Karen and Jack grow tired {{of the fact that}} Will and Grace are <b>not</b> <b>speaking</b> with each other, so they lure them to the same place and force them to make up. The four meet at Will and Vince's apartment, and even though Will and Grace have a {{pleasant}} evening together, they find that too much has changed between them, and drift apart.|$|E
5000|$|Eichelbaum {{interpreted}} his {{terms of}} reference such {{that he did not}} interview anyone who had been directly involved with the case. He did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> with any of the children. He did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> with the children's parents, some of whom regularly visited the Civic Crèche [...] He did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> with the children's evidential interviewers. He did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> with any of the crèche workers. He did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> with Ellis's mother. He did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> with Peter Ellis. He did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> with the oldest complainant, one of seven children upon whose evidence Ellis was convicted. Several months after the trial had ended, the child stated that she had not been sexually abused. Eichelbaum did not seek advice from academics within New Zealand universities when appointing experts for his inquiry. The only people with whom Eichelbaum discussed the matter of the selection of the experts were Justice Ministry officials and Thomas Lyon, a USA law professor. In 1999 Lyon criticised the direction and relevance of research undertaken by experts nominated by Ellis's counsel. Lyon's critique was cited approvingly in the Crown's submission to the ministerial inquiry.|$|R

5|$|The {{hospital}} receives several surgical {{residents from}} Mercy West {{as they enter}} Seattle Grace, a repercussion of the recent merger. Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) is recovering from her liver transplantation surgery, after donating a portion of it to her father. In the residents' lounge, Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) tries to explain to Mercy West resident Dr. Reed Adamson (Nora Zehetner) that she should not use a certain locker, due to it formerly belonging to the deceased Dr. George O'Malley (T.R. Knight). Adamson ignores her wishes, and uses the locker, leading Stevens to threatening to fight her. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) and Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) are working in the emergency room, when Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) embarrasses Yang by taking Mercy West resident Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams)' side in a disagreement. Despite her mindset that all Mercy West residents would act {{in the manner of}} Adamson, Stevens develops a friendship with Dr. Charles Percy (Robert Baker). After months of the two <b>not</b> <b>speaking,</b> Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez)'s father, Carlos (Héctor Elizondo), shows up to the hospital with a priest, trying to condemn Torres for her concurrence in homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{episode was}} written by South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and was {{directed}} by Parker; it was made on a budget of $300,000. Similarly to Parker and Stone's Christmas shorts, the original pilot was animated entirely with traditional cut paper stop motion animation techniques. This laborious process involved creating hundreds of construction paper cutouts – including individual mouth shapes, {{and many of the}} characters in several different sizes –, and photographing every frame of the show with an overhead camera, to the dialog that had been recorded earlier. Assistants helped with the cutting and pasting of the cutouts, while the animation was primarily done by Parker, Stone, and South Park animation director Eric Stough. The episode took between three and three and a half months to complete, and animation took place in a small room at Celluloid Studios, in Denver, Colorado, during the summer of 1996. Additional animation techniques involved creating the starry night sky by putting holes into a black posterboard and illuminating it from behind, and having the pooling of Kenny's blood simulated by drawing an initial dot with a red marker pen, and drawing more to it with every frame. The characters who are <b>not</b> <b>speaking</b> rarely move, saving time in the animation process.|$|E
