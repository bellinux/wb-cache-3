Much of the literature in this field assumes that the participants form a local picture of global state, yet {{little research has been}} done discussing how this state remains stable as nodes enter and leave the system. We assume that nodes remain in the system long enough to benefit from retaining state, but not sufficiently long that the dynamic nature of the problem can be ignored. We look at the components that describe a system's dependability and argue that next-generation decentralized systems must explicitly delineate the information dispersal mechanisms (e. g., probe, event-driven, broadcast), the capabilities assumed about constituent nodes (bandwidth, uptime, re-entry distributions), and distribution of information demands (<b>needles</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>haystack</b> vs. hay <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>haystack</b> [13]).

40|$|Abstract — A {{critical}} {{problem facing}} by managing large-scale clusters {{is to identify}} the location of problems <b>in</b> <b>a</b> system <b>in</b> case of unusual events. As the scale of high performance computing (HPC) grows, systems are getting bigger. When a system fails to function properly, health-related data are collected for troubleshooting. However, due to the massive quantities of information obtained from {{a large number of}} components, the root causes of anomalies are often buried like <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>haystack.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we present a localization method to automatically find out the potential root causes (i. e. a subset of nodes) of the problem from the overwhelming amount of data collected system-wide. System managers can focus on examining these potential locations, thereby significantly reducing human efforts required for anomaly localization. Our method consists of three interrelated steps: (1) feature collection to assemble a feature space for the system; (2) feature extraction to obtain the most significant features for efficient data analysis by applying the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm; and (3) outlier detection to quickly identify the nodes that are “far away” from the majority by using the cell-based detection algorithm.

40|$|<b>A</b> trend <b>in</b> all {{scientific}} disciplines, {{based on}} advances in technology, {{is the increasing}} availability of high dimensional data in which are buried important information. A current urgent challenge to statisticians is to develop effective methods of finding the useful information from the vast amounts of messy and noisy data available, {{most of which are}} noninformative. This paper presents a general computer intensive approach, based on a method pioneered by Lo and Zheng for detecting which, of many potential explanatory variables, have an influence on a dependent variable $Y$. This approach is suited to detect influential variables, where causal effects depend on the confluence of values of several variables. It has the advantage of avoiding a difficult direct analysis, involving possibly thousands of variables, by dealing with many randomly selected small subsets from which smaller subsets are selected, guided by a measure of influence $I$. The main objective is to discover the influential variables, rather than to measure their effects. Once they are detected, the problem of dealing with a much smaller group of influential variables should be vulnerable to appropriate analysis. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> sense, we are confining our attention to locating <b>a</b> few <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>haystack.</b> Comment: Published <b>in</b> at [URL] the Annals of Applied Statistics ([URL] by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics ([URL]...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{increased}} interest in the retrieval and integration of hidden Web data {{with a view to}} leverage high-quality information available in online databases. Although previous works have addressed many aspects of the actual integration, including matching form schemata and automatically filling out forms, the problem of locating relevant data sources has been largely overlooked. Given the dynamic nature of the Web, where data sources are constantly changing, it is crucial to automatically discover these resources. However, considering the number of documents on the Web (Google already indexes over 8 billion documents), automatically finding tens, hundreds or even thousands of forms that are relevant to the integration task is really like looking for <b>a</b> few <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>haystack.</b> Besides, since the vocabulary and structure of forms for a given domain are unknown until the forms are actually found, it is hard to define exactly what to look for.

The proposed strategy does that by focusing the crawl on a given topic; by judiciously choosing links to follow within a topic that are more likely to lead to pages that contain forms; and by employing appropriate stopping criteria.

40|$|Abstract Background With {{the advent}} of high {{throughput}} biotechnology data acquisition platforms such as micro arrays, SNP chips and mass spectrometers, data sets with many more variables than observations are now routinely being collected. Finding relationships between response variables of interest and variables in such data sets is an important problem akin to finding <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>haystack.</b> Whilst methods {{for a number of}} response types have been developed a general approach has been lacking. Results The major contribution {{of this paper is to}} present a unified methodology which allows many common (statistical) response models to be fitted to such data sets. The class of models includes virtually any model with <b>a</b> linear predictor <b>in</b> it, for example (but not limited to), multiclass logistic regression (classification), generalised linear models (regression) and survival models. A fast algorithm for finding sparse well fitting models is presented. The ideas are illustrated on real data sets with numbers of variables ranging from thousands to millions. R code implementing the ideas is available for download. Conclusion The method described in this paper enables existing work on response models when there are less variables than observations to be leveraged to the situation when there are many more variables than observations. It is a powerful approach to finding parsimonious models for such datasets. The method is capable of handling problems with millions of variables and a large variety of response types within the one framework. The method compares favourably to existing methods such as support vector machines and random forests, but has the advantage of not requiring separate variable selection steps. It is also works for data types which these methods were not designed to handle. The method usually produces very sparse models which make biological interpretation simpler and more focused. </p...|$|R

This kind of problem {{requires}} a paradigm shift - away from hypothesis driven searches of the data - towards a methodology that lets the data speak for itself. Dynamic Quantum Clustering (DQC) is such a methodology. DQC is a powerful visual method that works with big, high-dimensional data. It exploits variations of the density of the data (in feature space) and unearths subsets of the data that exhibit correlations among all the measured variables. The outcome of a DQC analysis is a movie that shows how and why sets of data-points are eventually classified as members of simple clusters or as members of - what we call - extended structures. This allows DQC to be successfully used <b>in</b> <b>a</b> non-conventional exploratory mode where one searches data for unexpected information without the need to model the data. We show how this works for big, complex, real-world datasets that come from five distinct fields: i. e., x-ray nano-chemistry, condensed matter, biology, seismology and finance. These studies show how DQC excels at uncovering unexpected, small - but meaningful - subsets of the data that contain important information. We also establish an important new result: namely, that big, complex datasets often contain interesting structures that will be missed by many conventional clustering techniques. Experience shows that these structures appear frequently enough that it is crucial to know they can exist, and that when they do, they encode important hidden information. In short, we not only demonstrate that DQC can be flexibly applied to datasets that present significantly different challenges, we also show how a simple analysis can be used to look for the <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> the haystack, determine what it is, and find what this means.

40|$|Distributed search {{problems}} are ubiquitous in Artificial Life (ALife). Many distributed search problems require identifying {{a rare and}} previously unseen event and producing a rapid response. This challenge amounts to finding and removing <b>an</b> unknown <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very large <b>haystack.</b> Traditional computational search models are unlikely to find, nonetheless, appropriately respond to, novel events, particularly given data distributed across multiple platforms <b>in</b> <b>a</b> variety of formats and sources with variable and unknown reliability. Biological systems have evolved solutions to distributed search and response under uncertainty. Immune systems and ant colonies efficiently scale up massively parallel search with automated response in highly dynamic environments, and both do so using distributed coordination without centralized control. These properties are relevant to ALife, where distributed, autonomous, robust and adaptive control is needed to design robot swarms, mobile computing networks, computer security systems and other distributed intelligent systems. They are also relevant for searching, tracking the spread of ideas, and understanding the impact of innovations in online social networks. We review design principles for Scalable Robust, Adaptive, Decentralized search with Automated Response (Scalable RADAR) in biology. We discuss how biological RADAR scales up efficiently, and then discuss in detail how modular search in the immune system can be mimicked or built upon in ALife. Such search mechanisms are particularly useful when components have limited capacity to communicate and social or physical distance makes long distance communication more costly.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} three studies done to estimate the extent of human trafficking from Ukraine. The studies were designed and reported by Dr. Ronald Hampton, principal investigator, Dr. Dwayne Ball, and (for one study) Ms. Julie Pennington, all of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Business Administration Marketing Department. Our intent in doing multiple survey studies was to attempt to converge on an estimate. Each method used has different and inevitable threats to validity, {{and there is no}} perfect method for estimating the extent of such a rare, hidden, and sometimes shameful event. Therefore, by using methods with different threats, we hoped to counter the inevitable criticism of the validity of a single method, and make any estimates at which we arrived much more credible. The results from the three studies lead us to conclude that in the past three–five years, at least 22, 000 Ukrainian citizens per year, and perhaps more than 36, 000 per year, have gone abroad to work and have been enslaved in one form or another. The total number enslaved appears to be probably well in excess of 110, 000. We believe the three survey methods are probably biased so as to produce somewhat smaller numbers of victims than the actual numbers, but are nonetheless the best that can be achieved. Hence we say, “Well in excess of. ” The methods and results of the three studies are tabulated below. The methodology and results are further discussed in subsequent chapters on each study. One critical point to mention here is that we used a common conceptual definition of human trafficking in all three studies: a resident left his or her home country and was forced to work <b>in</b> <b>a</b> foreign country for little or no pay. This definition allows us to encompass not only forms of slavery that exist in the popular imagination, such as brothel slavery or certain kinds of factory and agricultural slavery, but also “wage slavery” or “debt bondage,” in which slaves are nominally paid, but usually never enough to buy their way out of a forced work environment. The first study was a survey of close families done in five Eastern European countries, including Ukraine. This study was relatively small given the fact that finding human trafficking victims is like finding <b>needles</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>haystack</b> (1, 345 close families in Ukraine were surveyed). <b>In</b> addition, when <b>a</b> member of each close family was asked to specify how many members of that family had been trafficked, no time frame was specified, although it would be reasonable to assume that most answers were relevant to the past five–ten years. This study estimated that about 110, 000 Ukrainians had been trafficked abroad. For reasons discussed in the study report, we believe this estimate is low. The second study was a survey of “key informants. ” This is quite different from surveying close families or households. In the surveys of close families and households (Studies 2 and 3), someone potentially close to a trafficking victim was asked if someone in the family or household had been trafficked. There may be a natural reluctance to answer such a question positively, even if someone close has been victimized. Thus, estimates are probably biased downward. In Study 2, however, the person asked was someone not of the household or family of a potential victim, but <b>a</b> knowledgeable person <b>in</b> the neighborhood or a head teacher from a child’s school. Thus, the reluctance to answer positively would probably be much lessened {{on the part of the}} informant. However, the knowledge of someone’s victim status might be lessened as well, due to social distance. Thus, we replaced one probable major source of bias with another. In the case of the key informant study, our best estimate of known trafficking victims in Ukraine was about 110, 000 over five years. However, when we asked about strongly suspected victims, we estimated that there were another 110, 000. Thus, we feel quite certain the number of victims over the past five years has exceeded 22, 000 per year, and may possibly be 44, 000 per year or higher. The third study yielded the most accurate estimates in terms of low sampling error, since it was a survey of over 13, 000 households. Heads of households were interviewed and asked if anyone in the household had been trafficked over the past three years. From this survey, we obtained an estimate of about 111, 000 persons trafficked over the past three years, or about 37, 000 per year. This study has the same form of bias as the first study. That is, we are asking someone <b>in</b> <b>a</b> family or household to reveal that someone close to him or her was a trafficking victim. Thus, there is some unknown bias, almost certainly downward. So, looking across studies, we conclude that we can be fairly confident that at least 22, 000 Ukrainians per year have been enslaved abroad over the past 3 to 5 years, possibly close to double that number. Most – perhaps no more than five or ten per cent, ever get help from the rehabilitation experts at NGOs. Subsequent to the Table below, each study will be discussed in turn with results first, and then an extensive discussion of methodology...|$|R
