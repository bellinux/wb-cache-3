5|$|Shoe polish can be {{manufactured}} using large vats, reasonably powerful heaters and air conditioners. There is no set method of manufacture, although most methods use pressures of two atmospheres {{to ensure the}} <b>naphtha</b> does not boil off, and temperatures of up to 85°C.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish {{consists}} of a waxy colloidal emulsion, a substance composed {{of a number of}} partially immiscible liquids and solids mixed together. It is usually made from ingredients including some or all of <b>naphtha,</b> lanolin, turpentine, wax (often Carnauba wax), gum arabic, ethylene glycol, and if required a colourant, such as carbon black or an azo dye (such as aniline yellow). It typically has a specific gravity of 0.8, is negligibly soluble in water, and is made of between 65 and 77% volatile substances—usually <b>naphtha.</b> The high amount of volatile substances means that the shoe polish will dry out and harden after application, while retaining its shine.|$|E
5|$|Lithium is {{corrosive}} {{and requires}} special handling to avoid skin contact. Breathing lithium dust or lithium compounds (which are often alkaline) initially irritate {{the nose and}} throat, while higher exposure can cause a buildup of fluid in the lungs, leading to pulmonary edema. The metal itself is a handling hazard because contact with moisture produces the caustic lithium hydroxide. Lithium is safely stored in non-reactive compounds such as <b>naphtha.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish is {{traditionally}} packaged in flat, round, 60-gram (2-ounce) tins, usually with an easy-open facility. Because {{the amount of}} shoe polish {{that needs to be}} applied is small, and the shoe polish will desiccate due to volatile ingredients, such as <b>naphtha,</b> a large container would dry out before being fully used. The traditional flat, round tins have since become synonymous with shoe polishes.|$|E
5|$|Various {{substances}} {{have been}} used as shoe polish for hundreds of years, starting with natural substances such as wax and tallow. Modern polish formulas were introduced early in the 20th century and many of those original formulations are still in use today. Today, shoe polish is usually made from a mix of natural and synthetic materials, including <b>naphtha,</b> turpentine, dyes, and gum arabic, using straightforward chemical engineering processes. Shoe polish is usually flammable, can be toxic, and, if misused, can stain skin. It should be used in a well-ventilated area with care taken to protect clothes, carpet and furniture.|$|E
5|$|While other {{refineries}} {{would keep}} the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, <b>naphtha</b> shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost $2.50 each ended up only $.96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{crucifix}} {{was installed}} in the church of Santa Croce {{at the end of}} the thirteenth century and remained there until 1966 when the banks of the Arno river burst and flooded Florence. Thousands of artworks were damaged or destroyed; the Crucifix lost 60% of its paint. It had suffered earlier flood damage in 1333 and 1557. In 1966 it was on display in the lower Museo dell' Opera, which is at a lower elevation and closer to the waterline than the Santa Croce church, where it was located during earlier floods. The water level reached the height of Christ's halo and took large tracts of paint when it retreated. The water deposited oil, mud and <b>naphtha</b> on the wood frame, which further swelled from soakage, forcing the panel to expand and bend, cracking the paint-work.|$|E
5|$|The <b>naphtha</b> cut, as that {{fraction}} is called, {{contains many}} different hydrocarbon compounds. Therefore, {{it has an}} initial boiling point of about 35°C and a final boiling point of about 200°C. Each cut produced in the fractionating columns has a different boiling range. At some distance below the overhead, the next cut is withdrawn {{from the side of}} the column and it is usually the jet fuel cut, also known as a kerosene cut. The boiling range of that cut is from an initial boiling point of about 150°C to a final boiling point of about 270°C, and it also contains many different hydrocarbons. The next cut further down the tower is the diesel oil cut with a boiling range from about 180°C to about 315°C. The boiling ranges between any cut and the next cut overlap because the distillation separations are not perfectly sharp. After these come the heavy fuel oil cuts and finally the bottoms product, with very wide boiling ranges. All these cuts are processed further in subsequent refining processes.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} reason for removing sulfur from the <b>naphtha</b> streams within a petroleum refinery is that sulfur, even in extremely low concentrations, poisons the noble metal catalysts (platinum and rhenium) in the catalytic reforming units that are subsequently used to upgrade the octane rating of the <b>naphtha</b> streams.|$|E
25|$|The {{extraction}} of peat from the Somerset Levels began during the Roman times {{and has been}} carried out since the Levels were first drained. On Dartmoor, there were several commercial distillation plants formed and run by the British Patent <b>Naphtha</b> Company in 1844. These produced <b>naphtha</b> on a commercial scale from the high-quality local peat.|$|E
25|$|In 1895 Gladiator {{introduced}} its first internal combustion, a <b>naphtha</b> powered tricycle.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} {{solvents}} for rubber are turpentine and <b>naphtha</b> (petroleum). Because rubber does not dissolve easily, {{the material is}} finely divided by shredding prior to its immersion.|$|E
25|$|Fluid {{catalytic}} cracking produces a high yield of petrol and LPG, while hydrocracking {{is a major}} source of jet fuel, Diesel fuel, <b>naphtha,</b> and again yields LPG.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} of Greek fire is unknown. It remains {{a matter of}} speculation and debate, with various proposals including combinations of pine resin, <b>naphtha,</b> quicklime, calcium phosphide, sulfur, or niter.|$|E
25|$|The major {{products}} from hydrocracking are jet fuel and diesel, but low sulphur <b>naphtha</b> fractions and LPG are also produced. All these products {{have a very}} low content of sulfur and other contaminants.|$|E
25|$|Parades that {{commonly}} feature flambeaux include Babylon, Chaos, Le Krewe d'Etat, Druids, Hermes, Krewe of Muses, Krewe of Orpheus, Krewe of Proteus, Saturn, and Sparta. Flambeaux are {{powered by}} <b>naphtha,</b> a highly flammable aromatic.|$|E
25|$|When the HDS {{process is}} used to desulfurize a {{refinery}} <b>naphtha,</b> {{it is necessary to}} remove the total sulfur down to the parts per million range or lower in order to prevent poisoning the noble metal catalysts in the subsequent catalytic reforming of the naphthas.|$|E
25|$|On June 14, 2012, a bleeder plug on a tank in the Baton Rouge Refinery {{failed and}} began leaking <b>naphtha,</b> a {{substance}} that is composed of many chemicals including benzene. ExxonMobil originally reported to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) that 1,364 pounds of material had been leaked.|$|E
25|$|Many liquids {{are used}} as solvents, to {{dissolve}} other liquids or solids. Solutions are found {{in a wide variety}} of applications, including paints, sealants, and adhesives. <b>Naphtha</b> and acetone are used frequently in industry to clean oil, grease, and tar from parts and machinery. Body fluids are water based solutions.|$|E
25|$|The {{broadest}} {{range of}} fuel {{tests were conducted}} by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) labs in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Engineers estimated the performance and fuel economy of 1977 Gremlin Xs operating on ordinary gasoline, a variety of wide boiling range fuels (<b>naphtha,</b> kerosene, etc.), {{as well as two}} alcohols, ethanol and methanol.|$|E
25|$|The {{refinery}} HDS feedstocks (<b>naphtha,</b> kerosene, diesel oil, {{and heavier}} oils) contain {{a wide range}} of organic sulfur compounds, including thiols, thiophenes, organic sulfides and disulfides, and many others. These organic sulfur compounds are products of the degradation of sulfur containing biological components, present during the natural formation of the fossil fuel, petroleum crude oil.|$|E
25|$|On June 28, Alva Cape {{caught fire}} at anchor in Gravesend Bay while {{the last of}} the <b>naphtha</b> still on board was being removed. A series of explosions at 15:49 {{triggered}} the fire, which was controlled in about an hour, though fireboats remained on the scene to spray foam into the ship until late in the evening.|$|E
25|$|Several {{plants on}} the Gulf Coast of the US {{have been in}} {{development}} since 2013, as part of Dow's transition away from <b>naphtha.</b> Dow estimates the facilities will employ about 3000 people, and 5000 people during construction. The plants will manufacture materials for several of its growing segments, including hygiene and medical, transportation, electrical and telecommunications, packaging, consumer durables and sports and leisure.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1950s, {{the first}} noble metal {{catalytic}} reforming process (the Platformer process) was commercialized. At the same time, the catalytic hydrodesulfurization of the <b>naphtha</b> feed to such reformers was also commercialized. In the decades that followed, various proprietary catalytic hydrodesulfurization processes, {{such as the}} one depicted in the flow diagram below, have been commercialized. Currently, virtually all of the petroleum refineries worldwide have one or more HDS units.|$|E
25|$|Pure ethanol and {{alcoholic}} beverages are heavily taxed as psychoactive drugs, but ethanol has many uses {{that do not}} involve its consumption. To relieve the tax burden on these uses, most jurisdictions waive the tax when an agent {{has been added to}} the ethanol to render it unfit to drink. These include bittering agents such as denatonium benzoate and toxins such as methanol, <b>naphtha,</b> and pyridine. Products of this kind are called denatured alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Alkenes are {{produced}} by hydrocarbon cracking. Raw materials are mostly natural gas condensate components (principally ethane and propane) in the US and Mideast and <b>naphtha</b> in Europe and Asia. Alkanes are broken apart at high temperatures, often {{in the presence of}} a zeolite catalyst, to produce a mixture of primarily aliphatic alkenes and lower molecular weight alkanes. The mixture is feedstock and temperature dependent, and separated by fractional distillation. This is mainly used for the manufacture of small alkenes (up to six carbons).|$|E
25|$|Idemitsu Petrochemical runs two {{petrochemical}} {{plants in}} China and Tokuyama. It produces {{a variety of}} basic chemicals supplied to chemical industries, in Japan and abroad. In Europe it markets through Idemitsu Chemicals Europe PLC. Basic chemicals produced includes olefins such as ethylene and propylene, and aromatics like benzene, para-xylene and styrene monomer. It is also a supplier of plastics for uses such as CD pressing and circuit boards. The two <b>naphtha</b> crackers can produce up to 997,000 tonnes of ethylene per year.|$|E
25|$|In 1893 home {{manufacture}} was relocated from Belfast and Dublin to Coventry, {{the centre}} of the British cycle industry. The Dublin Corporation had launched a case against Pneumatic Tyre claiming nuisance from the smell of rubber and <b>naphtha.</b> Pneumatic Tyre soon spread developing interests in Birmingham. The following year a major interest was taken in their component supplier Byrne Bros India Rubber of Lichfield Road, Aston Birmingham. The same year du Cros started Cycle Components Manufacturing in Selly Oak to supply inner tubes.|$|E
25|$|The {{products}} {{produced in}} the reaction depend on {{the composition of the}} feed, the hydrocarbon to steam ratio and on the cracking temperature and furnace residence time. Light hydrocarbon feeds such as ethane, LPGs or light <b>naphtha</b> give product streams rich in the lighter alkenes, including ethylene, propylene, and butadiene. Heavier hydrocarbon (full range and heavy naphthas as well as other refinery products) feeds give some of these, but also give products rich in aromatic hydrocarbons and hydrocarbons suitable for inclusion in gasoline or fuel oil.|$|E
25|$|Gasoline {{contains}} about 46.7 MJ/kg (127 MJ/US gal, 35.3 kWh/US gal, 13.0 kWh/kg, 120,405 BTU/US gal), quoting the lower heating value. Gasoline blends differ, and therefore actual energy content {{varies according to}} the season and producer by up to 1.75% {{more or less than}} the average. On average, about 74 L of gasoline (19.5 US gal, 16.3 imp gal) are available from a barrel of crude oil (about 46% by volume), varying due to quality of crude and grade of gasoline. The remainder are products ranging from tar to <b>naphtha.</b>|$|E
25|$|Methanol (also {{known as}} methyl alcohol, carbinol, wood alcohol, wood <b>naphtha</b> or wood spirits) is a {{chemical}} compound with chemical formula CH3OH. It is the simplest alcohol, {{and is a}} light, volatile, colorless, flammable, poisonous liquid with a distinctive odor that is somewhat milder and sweeter than ethanol (ethyl alcohol). At room temperature, it is a polar solvent and is used as an antifreeze, solvent, fuel, and as a denaturant for ethyl alcohol. It is not popular for machinery, but {{may be found in}} automotive windshield washer fluid, de-icers, and gasoline additives.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of these oils and solid paraffin wax from coal formed {{the subject of}} his patent dated 17 October 1850. In 1850 Young & Meldrum and Edward William Binney entered into partnership under the title of E.W. Binney & Co. at Bathgate in West Lothian and E. Meldrum & Co. at Glasgow; their works at Bathgate were completed in 1851 and became the first truly commercial oil-works in the world, using oil extracted from locally mined torbanite, lamosite, and bituminous coal to manufacture <b>naphtha</b> and lubricating oils; paraffin for fuel use and solid paraffin were not sold till 1856.|$|E
25|$|Steam {{cracking}} is a petrochemical {{process in}} which saturated hydrocarbons are broken down into smaller, often unsaturated, hydrocarbons. It is the principal industrial method for producing the lighter alkenes (or commonly olefins), including ethene (or ethylene) and propene (or propylene). Steam cracker units are facilities in which a feedstock such as <b>naphtha,</b> liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), ethane, propane or butane is thermally cracked {{through the use of}} steam in a bank of pyrolysis furnaces to produce lighter hydrocarbons. The products obtained depend on the composition of the feed, the hydrocarbon-to-steam ratio, and on the cracking temperature and furnace residence time.|$|E
25|$|In steam cracking, a gaseous or liquid {{hydrocarbon}} feed like <b>naphtha,</b> LPG or ethane is diluted with steam and briefly heated in a furnace without {{the presence of}} oxygen. Typically, the reaction temperature is very high, at around 850°C, but the reaction is only allowed to take place very briefly. In modern cracking furnaces, the residence time is reduced to milliseconds to improve yield, resulting in gas velocities up to the speed of sound. After the cracking temperature has been reached, the gas is quickly quenched to stop the reaction in a transfer line heat exchanger or inside a quenching header using quench oil.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1820s, two {{separate}} reports described a white solid with a pungent odor {{derived from the}} distillation of coal tar. In 1821, John Kidd cited these two disclosures and then described many of this substance's properties and the means of its production. He proposed the name naphthaline, {{as it had been}} derived from a kind of <b>naphtha</b> (a broad term encompassing any volatile, flammable liquid hydrocarbon mixture, including coal tar). Naphthalene's chemical formula was determined by Michael Faraday in 1826. The structure of two fused benzene rings was proposed by Emil Erlenmeyer in 1866, and confirmed by Carl Gräbe three years later.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of these oils and solid paraffin wax from coal formed {{the subject of}} his patent dated 17 October 1850. In 1850 Young & Meldrum and Edward William Binney entered into partnership under the title of E.W. Binney & Co. at Bathgate in West Lothian and E. Meldrum & Co. at Glasgow; their works at Bathgate were completed in 1851 and became the first truly commercial oil-works in the world with the first modern oil refinery, using oil extracted from locally mined torbanite, shale, and bituminous coal to manufacture <b>naphtha</b> and lubricating oils; paraffin for fuel use and solid paraffin were not sold until 1856.|$|E
