Significant browning occurs in sultanas during storage and shipping, which seriously degrades sultana colour as well as overall quality. Whilst the cause of sultana browning during drying has been attributed to polyphenol oxidase (PPO) mediated oxidation of sultana phenolic substrates, the browning which occurs during sultana storage is less well-defined. The occurrence of non-enzymatic Maillard reactions has been suggested by a number of researchers, yet there has been no specific research conducted to elucidate these reactions in sultanas.

40|$|<b>Non-enzymatic</b> <b>browning</b> is {{a common}} and complex {{reaction}} that occurs in everyday cooking-indeed, it is a crucial step in food processing. A typical browning process includes both the Maillard reaction and caramelization, which normally occur only at extreme temperatures to produce both desired and distinctive flavours and an intense brown colour in foods. On one hand, advanced stage Maillard reaction compounds canbe toxic, such as acrylamide and 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural (5 -HMF). And yet on the other hand, Maillard reaction compounds can possess bioactivities including taste enhancing, antioxidant and antimicrobial capacities; collectively these are known as Maillard reacted peptides (MRPs). This bizarre paradox among <b>non-enzymatic</b> <b>browning</b> reaction compounds has long deserved a more in depth investigation under controlled conditions. To achieve these positive bioactivities yet reduce the accumulation of the harmful compounds associated with the Maillard reaction, a research strategy was proposed to produce and understand MRPs at. lower temperatures. However, information on the antioxidant and sensorial properties MRPs at moderate temperatures is scarce. Glucosamine (GlcN) is an amino sugar recently revealed {{to be capable of}} triggering a fast Maillard reaction with protein at 25 Â°C. Additionally, due to the presence of both a carbonyl and amino group wi hin the same molecule, GlcN can form substantial dicarbonyls at 37 Â°C-the precursors to desirable flavours. The main objective of this thesis was to study taste enhancement and antioxidant activity of GlcNpeptides in GlcN model systems. A total of 3 studies were designed representing the main building blocks of this project. The first study focused on the potential of GlcN to modifying protein hydrolysates at 25 and 37 Â°C in a fish gelatin hydrolysates-GlcN model. Modification of the hydrolysates by GlcN was accomplished by two approaches: firstly, a Maillardbased glycation with GlcN, and secondly, an enzymatic glycosylation catalyzed by the transglutaminase (TGase), condensing the primary amine group of GlcN with the carboxamide group of a glutamine residue in a peptide. GlcN-induced modification was achieved at both 25 and 37 Â°C, and the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities were improved compared to native hydrolysates. The second study focused on the taste enhancing property of GlcN-modified hydrolysed meat proteins produced at 37 and 50 Â°C in {{the presence or absence of}} TGase. Samples were formulated into seasoning compositions and evaluated by untrained consumers. The meat protein hydrolysate was perceived as the saltiest (p< 0. 05) whereas the glycated hydrolysate produced at 50 Â°C tended (p= 0. 0593) to be the most savoury seasoning composition. This further confirmed the role of GlcN as an important component in modified hydrolysate by eliciting an umami taste, despite its inability to strike a balance between: eliciting saltiness and savouriness. The <b>non-enzymatic</b> <b>browning</b> of GlcN was further investigated in the third study. Chemical-physico changes and antioxidant activity were monitored in 3 -level factorial models: in phosphate buffer versus ammonium hydroxide solution, at 40 versus 60 Â°C, and incubated up to 48 h. Incubation at 40 Â°C for 6 h produced a yellow-coloured caramel with the greatest levels of anti-radical activity and diacetyl-a volatile flavour compound of dicarbonyls. Overall, this thesis showed GlcN to be a reactive amino sugar capable of key rapid peptide reactions and self-modifications at moderate temperatures. Compounds from these GlcN-mediated <b>non-enzymatic</b> <b>browning</b> reactions not only represent important flavour and colour agents, but also showed promise as antimicrobials and antioxidants. A future paradigm shift is anticipated for GlcN, evolving from its current status as a health supplement to become a multi-functional food ingredient...|$|E

To reuse {{the waste}} of fishery {{resources}} in a preliminary study, we have described changes in extractive components during spontaneous fermentation of fish sauce using eel intestines. This study was aimed at investigating the chemical analysis of extractive components from fermented eel intestines {{with a view to}} using it as a food condiment. Fish sauce was produced via fermentation of by-products (intestinal) of processed eel with 35 % (w/w) of salt for 180 days. During 180 days of fermentation, the pH decreased to approximately 4. 8, and the overall trend of total nitrogen, amino acid nitrogen, <b>non-enzymatic</b> <b>browning</b> index and total volatile basic nitrogen were increasing. The changes and the trend mentioned above indicated that it was a practical method to produce fish sauce using eel intestines, but the spontaneous fermentation cycle was long (more than 6 months) ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the effect of ohmic heating and {{ultrasound}} on quality parameters of red grapefruit juice (Citrus paradisi). The juice was processed by ohmic heating (120 V, 70 and 80 Â°C, 30 and 180 s) and ultrasound (amplitude of 40 and 50 Âµm, and 2 and 10 minutes). The treatments did not significantly affect the cloud value, pH, <b>non-enzymatic</b> <b>browning</b> and colorimetric parameters. The taste was the determining parameter in the choice of juice by consumers. Juices processed with ohmic heating showed sensory characteristics more like the natural juice. The best juice was obtenied by processing with OH at 70 Â°C for 30 s. According to the present study it could be suggested that red grapefruit juice processed by ohmic heating could improve sensory characteristics without changes in quality parameter...|$|E
40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the relationship between}} death of freeze-dried cells of Lactobacillus bulgaricus during storage and decrease in powder solubility, the effect of milk precipitation during rehydration of freeze-dried Lb. delbrueckiissp. bulgaricus upon death of these cells throughout storage, via addition of various carbohydrates to the drying medium was studied. The degree of survival of freeze-dried Lb. bulgaricus {{was found to be}} directly proportional to the square root of the absorbance of the supernatant. A darker powder resulted when most of the microorganism had died. A tentative explanation for the insolubility observed when the viability of the cells decreased is based on an increase in the extent of <b>non-enzymatic</b> <b>browning</b> (Maillard reactions), as a result of cell death. Results obtained throughout this study might represent a helpful tool towards development of a novel, straightforward, shortcut method for monitoring the viability of freeze-dried samples during storag...|$|E
40|$|Apple juice {{concentrate}} amongst {{other uses}} {{is used to}} formulate concentrated and single strength fruit juice blends. An apple juice concentrate whose quality has deteriorated during storage poses problems for the processing industries as it limits its use {{in the formulation of}} certain products. A dark coloured apple juice concentrate cannot be used to formulate light coloured beverages while an apple concentrate contaminated with microbes can only be incorporated into products with a pasteurisation treatment. It is important to evaluate the deterioration in the quality of apple juice concentrate stored at normal and at accelerated temperatures. The physicochemical parameters and microbial counts were monitored in apple juice concentrate stored at 10 ÂºC (normal temperature) and at 25 ÂºC and 35 ÂºC (accelerated temperatures) over 12 weeks after which modelling of the experimental data was done. The Biolog system and (GTG) 5 PCR fingerprinting were used to identify isolated yeasts. There was a significant change (pâ¤ 0. 05) in L*, b*, a*, hue, chroma, total colour difference (TCD), <b>non-enzymatic</b> <b>browning</b> index (A 420 nm) and 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural concentration with storage time and temperature. The Q 10 values for L*, b*, <b>non-enzymatic</b> <b>browning</b> index (A 420 nm) and 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural were 1. 53, 1. 20, 1. 81 and 5. 25, respectively and activation energies were 8. 17, 7. 70 and 14. 8 kcal mol- 1 for L*, b* and <b>non-enzymatic</b> <b>browning</b> index (A 420 nm), respectively. Microbial growth was not observed in apple juice concentrate stored at 10 ÂºC while yeast and mould growth was observed after 5 weeks of storage at 25 ÂºC and 35 ÂºC. After fitting the yeast growth data into the Baranyi and Roberts model, no significant difference was observed in the lag phase for yeast growth at 25 ÂºC and 35 ÂºC while {{there was a significant difference}} pâ¤ 0. 05 in the maximum specific growth rate. The theoretical minimum temperature of growth extrapolated from the Ratkowsky model was about 20 ÂºC. The activation energy and Q 10 values for the maximum specific growth rate were 39. 95 kcal mol- 1 and 4. 47, respectively. The isolated yeasts were identified as Kluyveromyces delphensis, Saccharomyces dairensis, Zygosaccharomyces bailii, Rhodotorula glutinis and Metchnikowia reukaufii and strain variability was observed for the species K. delphensis and S. dairensis. The higher Q 10 and activation energy values for the maximum specific growth rate of yeasts in comparison with the Maillard browning parameters (L*, b* and A 420 nm) signify that loss in quality due to yeast growth is more rapid compared to Maillard browning. The results of this study show that under refrigerated storage temperatures deterioration in the quality of apple juice concentrate is due to Maillard browning while at accelerated storage temperatures quality loss is due to both Maillard browning and microbial growth of yeasts. At accelerated storage temperatures, darkening of the apple juice concentrate starts immediately and continues throughout the storage period. However growth of spoilage yeasts is only detected after 5 weeks of storage and proceeds rapidly thereafter resulting in spoilage.
