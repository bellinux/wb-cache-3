40|$|<b>Non-enzymatic</b> <b>browning</b> is {{a common}} and complex {{reaction}} that occurs in everyday cooking-indeed, it is a crucial step in food processing. A typical browning process includes both the Maillard reaction and caramelization, which normally occur only at extreme temperatures to produce both desired and distinctive flavours and an intense brown colour in foods. On one hand, advanced stage Maillard reaction compounds canbe toxic, such as acrylamide and 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural (5 -HMF). And yet on the other hand, Maillard reaction compounds can possess bioactivities including taste enhancing, antioxidant and antimicrobial capacities; collectively these are known as Maillard reacted peptides (MRPs). This bizarre paradox among <b>non-enzymatic</b> <b>browning</b> reaction compounds has long deserved a more in depth investigation under controlled conditions. To achieve these positive bioactivities yet reduce the accumulation of the harmful compounds associated with the Maillard reaction, a research strategy was proposed to produce and understand MRPs at. lower temperatures. However, information on the antioxidant and sensorial properties MRPs at moderate temperatures is scarce. Glucosamine (GlcN) is an amino sugar recently revealed {{to be capable of}} triggering a fast Maillard reaction with protein at 25 °C. Additionally, due to the presence of both a carbonyl and amino group wi hin the same molecule, GlcN can form substantial dicarbonyls at 37 °C-the precursors to desirable flavours. The main objective of this thesis was to study taste enhancement and antioxidant activity of GlcNpeptides in GlcN model systems. A total of 3 studies were designed representing the main building blocks of this project. The first study focused on the potential of GlcN to modifying protein hydrolysates at 25 and 37 °C in a fish gelatin hydrolysates-GlcN model. Modification of the hydrolysates by GlcN was accomplished by two approaches: firstly, a Maillardbased glycation with GlcN, and secondly, an enzymatic glycosylation catalyzed by the transglutaminase (TGase), condensing the primary amine group of GlcN with the carboxamide group of a glutamine residue in a peptide. GlcN-induced modification was achieved at both 25 and 37 °C, and the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities were improved compared to native hydrolysates. The second study focused on the taste enhancing property of GlcN-modified hydrolysed meat proteins produced at 37 and 50 °C in {{the presence or absence of}} TGase. Samples were formulated into seasoning compositions and evaluated by untrained consumers. The meat protein hydrolysate was perceived as the saltiest (p< 0. 05) whereas the glycated hydrolysate produced at 50 °C tended (p= 0. 0593) to be the most savoury seasoning composition. This further confirmed the role of GlcN as an important component in modified hydrolysate by eliciting an umami taste, despite its inability to strike a balance between: eliciting saltiness and savouriness. The <b>non-enzymatic</b> <b>browning</b> of GlcN was further investigated in the third study. Chemical-physico changes and antioxidant activity were monitored in 3 -level factorial models: in phosphate buffer versus ammonium hydroxide solution, at 40 versus 60 °C, and incubated up to 48 h. Incubation at 40 °C for 6 h produced a yellow-coloured caramel with the greatest levels of anti-radical activity and diacetyl-a volatile flavour compound of dicarbonyls. Overall, this thesis showed GlcN to be a reactive amino sugar capable of key rapid peptide reactions and self-modifications at moderate temperatures. Compounds from these GlcN-mediated <b>non-enzymatic</b> <b>browning</b> reactions not only represent important flavour and colour agents, but also showed promise as antimicrobials and antioxidants. A future paradigm shift is anticipated for GlcN, evolving from its current status as a health supplement to become a multi-functional food ingredient...|$|E

40|$|Apple juice {{concentrate}} amongst {{other uses}} {{is used to}} formulate concentrated and single strength fruit juice blends. An apple juice concentrate whose quality has deteriorated during storage poses problems for the processing industries as it limits its use {{in the formulation of}} certain products. A dark coloured apple juice concentrate cannot be used to formulate light coloured beverages while an apple concentrate contaminated with microbes can only be incorporated into products with a pasteurisation treatment. It is important to evaluate the deterioration in the quality of apple juice concentrate stored at normal and at accelerated temperatures. The physicochemical parameters and microbial counts were monitored in apple juice concentrate stored at 10 ºC (normal temperature) and at 25 ºC and 35 ºC (accelerated temperatures) over 12 weeks after which modelling of the experimental data was done. The Biolog system and (GTG) 5 PCR fingerprinting were used to identify isolated yeasts. There was a significant change (p≤ 0. 05) in L*, b*, a*, hue, chroma, total colour difference (TCD), <b>non-enzymatic</b> <b>browning</b> index (A 420 nm) and 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural concentration with storage time and temperature. The Q 10 values for L*, b*, <b>non-enzymatic</b> <b>browning</b> index (A 420 nm) and 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural were 1. 53, 1. 20, 1. 81 and 5. 25, respectively and activation energies were 8. 17, 7. 70 and 14. 8 kcal mol- 1 for L*, b* and <b>non-enzymatic</b> <b>browning</b> index (A 420 nm), respectively. Microbial growth was not observed in apple juice concentrate stored at 10 ºC while yeast and mould growth was observed after 5 weeks of storage at 25 ºC and 35 ºC. After fitting the yeast growth data into the Baranyi and Roberts model, no significant difference was observed in the lag phase for yeast growth at 25 ºC and 35 ºC while {{there was a significant difference}} p≤ 0. 05 in the maximum specific growth rate. The theoretical minimum temperature of growth extrapolated from the Ratkowsky model was about 20 ºC. The activation energy and Q 10 values for the maximum specific growth rate were 39. 95 kcal mol- 1 and 4. 47, respectively. The isolated yeasts were identified as Kluyveromyces delphensis, Saccharomyces dairensis, Zygosaccharomyces bailii, Rhodotorula glutinis and Metchnikowia reukaufii and strain variability was observed for the species K. delphensis and S. dairensis. The higher Q 10 and activation energy values for the maximum specific growth rate of yeasts in comparison with the Maillard browning parameters (L*, b* and A 420 nm) signify that loss in quality due to yeast growth is more rapid compared to Maillard browning. The results of this study show that under refrigerated storage temperatures deterioration in the quality of apple juice concentrate is due to Maillard browning while at accelerated storage temperatures quality loss is due to both Maillard browning and microbial growth of yeasts. At accelerated storage temperatures, darkening of the apple juice concentrate starts immediately and continues throughout the storage period. However growth of spoilage yeasts is only detected after 5 weeks of storage and proceeds rapidly thereafter resulting in spoilage.
