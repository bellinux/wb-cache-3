5|$|Synchrotrons are {{generally}} national facilities, each with several dedicated beamlines where data is collected without interruption. Synchrotrons were originally {{designed for use}} by high-energy physicists studying subatomic particles and cosmic phenomena. The largest component of each synchrotron is its electron storage ring. This ring is actually <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> circle, but a many-sided polygon. At each corner of the polygon, or sector, precisely aligned magnets bend the electron stream. As the electrons’ path is bent, they emit bursts {{of energy in the}} form of X-rays.|$|E
5|$|James was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> {{stand-in}} for Montgomery. He {{had lost}} a finger during the First World War, so a prosthetic had to be made. He had also never flown before, so the London Controlling Section's Dennis Wheatley took James up for a test flight {{to make sure he}} did not suffer from air sickness. Finally, James both drank heavily and smoked cigars, while Montgomery was a teetotaler and disliked smoking. The deception planners were worried that James might be spotted drinking, spoiling the performance. Despite these hitches, and with Montgomery's approval, the plan went forward. To get into character, James spent some time with the general, posing as a journalist, to study his mannerisms.|$|E

However, it is not clear from their characterization how to find a subset of three characters that does <b>not</b> have <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> phylogeny without testing all triples of characters. In this note, we build upon their result by giving a simple characterization of when a set of three-state characters does <b>not</b> have <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> phylogeny that can be inferred from testing all pairs of characters...|$|R

In addition, {{there are a number}} of horizontal asymmetries – day-night difference in the height of the ionosphere, latitudinal changes in the Earth's magnetic field, sudden ionospheric disturbances, polar cap absorption, variation in the Earth radius of ± 11km from equator to geographic poles, etc. that produce other effects in the Schumann resonance power spectra.|$|E
25|$|Though not deterministic, the inculcation of the {{subjective}} {{structures of the}} habitus can be observed through statistical data, for example, while its selective affinity with the objective structures of the social world explains {{the continuity of the}} social order through time. As the individual habitus is always a mix of multiple engagements in the social world through the person's life, while the social fields are put into practice through the agency of the individuals, no social field or order can be completely stable. In other words, if the relation between individual predisposition and social structure is far stronger than common sense tends to believe, it is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> match.|$|E

25|$|Currently, {{autologous}} nerve grafting, or a nerve autograft, {{is known}} as the gold standard for clinical treatments used to repair large lesion gaps in the peripheral nervous system. It is important that nerves are not repaired under tension, which could otherwise happen if cut ends are reapproximated across a gap. Nerve segments are taken from another part of the body (the donor site) and inserted into the lesion to provide endoneurial tubes for axonal regeneration across the gap. However, this is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> treatment; often the final outcome is only limited function recovery. Also, partial deinnervation is frequently experienced at the donor site, and multiple surgeries are required to harvest the tissue and implant it.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{correction}} fluid made its appearance, under brand {{names such as}} Liquid Paper, Wite-Out and Tipp-Ex; it was invented by Bette Nesmith Graham.

However, when held to the light, the covered-up characters were visible, as was the patch of dry {{correction fluid}} (which was never perfectly flat, and frequently <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> match for the color, texture, and luster of the surrounding paper). The standard trick for solving this problem was photocopying the corrected page, but this was possible only with high quality photocopiers.|$|E
25|$|Such {{magnetic}} fields may be advected inward from {{the interstellar medium}} or generated by a magnetic dynamo within the disk. Magnetic fields strengths at least of order 100 Gauss seem necessary for the magneto-centrifugal mechanism to launch powerful jets. There are problems, however, in carrying external magnetic flux inward towards the central star of the disk. High electric conductivity dictates that the magnetic field is frozen into the matter which is being accreted onto the central object with a slow velocity. However, the plasma is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> electric conductor, so there is always some degree of dissipation. The magnetic field diffuses away faster than {{the rate at which}} it is being carried inward by accretion of matter.|$|E

In that case, O is free to choose any edge as its second move.

25|$|The Earth is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> sphere but an oblate spheroid, with an {{equatorial}} diameter about 43 kilometers {{larger than}} its polar diameter. Because of the Earth's axial tilt, {{during most of}} the year the half of this bulge that is closest to the Sun is off-center, either to the north or to the south, and the far half is off-center on the opposite side. The gravitational pull on the closer half is stronger, since gravity decreases with distance, so this creates a small torque on the Earth as the Sun pulls harder {{on one side of the}} Earth than the other. The axis of this torque is roughly perpendicular to the axis of the Earth's rotation so the axis of rotation precesses. If the Earth were a perfect sphere, there would be no precession.|$|E
