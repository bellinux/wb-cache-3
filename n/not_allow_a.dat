5|$|In December 1986, the Public Road Administration {{recommended}} a bridge solution. SBT {{changed its name}} to Sunnhordland Bru- og Tunnelselskap, and a majority of the board shifted towards being in favor of a fixed link. The Norwegian Coastal Administration stated that they would <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> pontoon bridge. On 26 June 1987, SBT decided to work towards permission to collect advanced tolls on the ferry services. The board unanimously supported the triangular proposal on 16 September, which was estimated to cost NOK660 million. This was criticized by Hordaland Public Roads Administration, who stated that it would take longer time to plan, and thus complete, the Triangle Link.|$|E
5|$|Nicol {{made his}} major league debut for the Browns on September 23, 1890, {{starting}} the {{game against the}} Philadelphia Athletics {{that resulted in a}} 21–2 win. He did <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> single hit to the Athletics through seven innings, after which the game was called off due to darkness. Although the game was previously considered a no-hitter, a rule change made by the MLB's Committee on Statistical Accuracy in 1991 redefined the definition of a no-hitter; a no-hit game now had to span a minimum of nine innings. As a result, Nicol's debut was one of fifty no-hitters deleted from the official record books.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees {{were just}} 1½ games behind the Toronto Blue Jays when they {{acquired}} Lee Smith, and he pitched nearly perfectly {{for the last}} month of the season. In eight games, Smith did <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> single run and picked up three saves and 11 strikeouts. The Yankees as a team, however, did poorly during {{the remainder of the}} season, and Toronto easily pulled away to win the division. Smith's New York career lasted just those eight games as he filed for free agency after the season. He signed with Baltimore for 1994 for $1.5 million plus incentives.|$|E
5|$|The game {{then became}} a pitcher's duel; Maglie and Newcombe did <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> hit in {{the third or fourth}} innings. In the fifth, Billy Cox singled on a bunt, and Thomson hit a double, but the score {{remained}} 1–0 through five innings. Duke Snider singled in the sixth inning, but was caught stealing second. Neither team got another hit until the seventh inning. Rube Walker singled for the Dodgers, and Monte Irvin led off the bottom of the seventh with a double for the Giants. He reached third base after a bunt, and scored on a sacrifice fly by Thomson, tying the score at one run each.|$|E
5|$|There was no {{official}} outcome from these hearings, but Congress subsequently passed a Consular Reform Bill {{which included a}} provision that specifically would <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> diplomat, such as Magoon, to hold a separate administrative position. Rather than remove Magoon {{from one of his}} positions, he was named to become vice governor-general of the Philippines. Ultimately, this offer was rescinded before it could take effect, and he was instead appointed governor of Cuba.|$|E

5|$|After Quantrill {{became a}} free agent, Mota became the setup man for Gagné in 2004. He started {{the season with}} eight {{straight}} scoreless games. From June 27 to July 16, he did <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> run in 10 straight games. On July 29, he started a career-high five-game winning streak {{when he got a}} win by pitching two scoreless innings in a 2–1 victory over the San Francisco Giants. He was the winning pitcher when he pitched two scoreless innings in an 8–5 victory over the Anaheim Angels on July 3 in a game notable for Gagné getting the final save of his 84 straight converted save chances. On July 30, a day before the trade deadline, Mota had a 2.14 ERA in 52 games. That day, he was traded to the Florida Marlins with Juan Encarnación and Paul Lo Duca for Hee-seop Choi, Brad Penny, and Bill Murphy.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond never {{returned}} to Antioch (he went to Sicily where he died in 1111), and the carefully constructed clauses of the Treaty were never implemented. Bohemond's nephew, Tancred, refused to honor the Treaty. In his mind, Antioch was his by right of conquest. He {{saw no reason to}} hand it over to someone who had not been involved in the Crusade, and had indeed actively worked against it (as the Crusaders believed). The Crusaders seem to have felt Alexios had tricked Bohemond into giving him Antioch; they already believed Alexios was devious and untrustworthy and this may have confirmed their beliefs. The treaty referred to Tancred as the illegal holder of Antioch, and Alexios had expected Bohemond to expel him or somehow control him. Tancred also did <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> Greek Patriarch to enter the city; instead, Greek Patriarchs were appointed in Constantinople and nominally held power there.|$|E
5|$|Bryant Haliday {{was cast}} in the lead role as Professor Steiner. He was chosen for the role as Gordon was opposed to a British actor playing the title role, and the budget would <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> Hollywood star to be used. The fact that Gordon was already {{familiar}} with him, as he had cast him in Curse of Simba and Devil Doll, was also a factor. Haliday, a fan of horror movies, enjoyed doing The Projected Man. British stage actress Mary Peach {{was cast in}} the lead role as Dr. Patricia Hill. It was insisted that she be given top billing for her role. Norman Wooland, a German-born British character actor, was cast as Dr. Blanchard, the film's villain. Derek Farr portrays Inspector Davis, and Ronald Allen {{plays the role of}} Dr. Christopher Mitchell. A scene in the film features actress Norma West lying topless on a morgue table; this scene was added to aid sales overseas.|$|E

5|$|East Carolina's defense {{managed a}} strong {{performance}} statistically and in real terms. The most obvious {{examples of this}} were the two interceptions and two forced fumbles. On the first play of the second drive of the second quarter, Boise State quarterback Taylor Tharp threw an interception to defensive back Travis Williams. Williams also recorded eightsolo tackles—the second-highest total for the Pirates–and a forced fumble. The other interception came from defensive back J.J. Milbrook, who also boasted threesolo tackles, tying him for fifth–best on the team. Linebacker Jeremy forced the final Broncos turnover, gaining the ball and fouryards on the play. In addition to his forced fumble, Chambliss recorded four solo tackles. The Pirates' defense as a whole only gave up threeyards {{in the first quarter}} and did <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> first down until halfway through the second quarter.|$|E
5|$|In December 1986, the Public Roads Administration {{recommended}} a bridge. A report published by SBT in 1987 considered detailed {{plans for a}} subsea tunnel to the mainland, which was followed up by seismic surveys in the fjord. SBT {{changed its name to}} Sunnhordland Bru- og Tunnelselskap, and a majority of the board shifted towards being in favor of a fixed link. The Norwegian Coastal Administration stated that they would <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> pontoon bridge, as it would interfere with ship traffic. On 26 June 1987, SBT's board decided to work towards getting permission to collect advance tolls on the ferry services. On 16 September, they unanimously supported the triangular proposal, which was estimated to cost NOK660 million. This was criticized by Hordaland Public Roads Administration, who stated that it would take a longer time to plan, and thus complete, the Triangle Link.|$|E
5|$|Lesions can be transverse, {{occurring}} {{between the}} rings of the trachea, longitudinal or spiral. They may occur along the membranous {{part of the}} trachea, the main bronchi, or both. In 8% of ruptures, lesions are complex, occurring {{in more than one}} location, with more than one type of lesion, or on both of the main bronchi and the trachea. Transverse tears are more common than longitudinal or complex ones. The laceration may completely transect the airway or it may go only partway around. Partial tears that do not go {{all the way around the}} circumference of the airway do <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> lacerated airway to become completely detached; tears that encircle the whole airway can allow separation to occur. Lacerations may also be classified as complete or incomplete. In an incomplete lesion, a layer of tissue surrounding the bronchus remains intact and can keep the air in the airway, preventing it from leaking into the areas surrounding the airways. Incomplete lacerations may require closer scrutiny to detect and may not be diagnosed right away.|$|E

5|$|On April 15, 2009, Kershaw pitched seven innings, {{striking}} out 13 batters while allowing only one hit (a solo home run) against the rival San Francisco Giants. He {{was the youngest}} Dodger to ever strikeout 13 or more batters in a game since Sandy Koufax {{did it in the}} 1955 season. On May 17, 2009, Kershaw did <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> hit against the Florida Marlins through 7 innings, then gave up a lead-off double to Florida's Cody Ross. In 2009, despite an 8–8 record, he led the major leagues in opposing batting average (.200), opposing slugging percentage (.282), and hits per nine innings (6.26). He also posted an ERA of 2.79 and 185 strikeouts. Kershaw also walked 91 batters, which was second most in the National League (NL).|$|E
5|$|On June 23, 2017, Fister was claimed off waivers by the Boston Red Sox. On June 25, Fister {{made his}} first start with the Red Sox, going 7 2/3 innings and {{striking}} out 5 batters, allowing 2 earned runs and getting the win in a 6-2 victory against the Cleveland Indians. On an August 22 start in Cleveland, Fister allowed a lead off home run to Francisco Lindor to briefly tie the score at 1-1, but this {{would turn out to}} be the only hit registered by the Indians as Fister would go on to pitch a complete game 1-hitter and <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> hit to the final 28 batters faced in the game in an eventual 9-1 Red Sox win.|$|E
5|$|Ruth {{made his}} first {{appearance}} as a professional ballplayer in an inter-squad game on March 7, 1914. He played shortstop and pitched the last two innings of a 15–9 victory. In his second at-bat, Ruth hit a long home run to right field; the blast was locally reported to be longer than a legendary shot hit by Jim Thorpe in Fayetteville. Ruth made first appearance against a team in organized baseball in an exhibition game versus the major-league Philadelphia Phillies. Ruth pitched the middle three innings and gave up two runs in the fourth, but then settled down and pitched a scoreless fifth and sixth innings. In {{a game against the}} Phillies the following afternoon, Ruth entered during the sixth inning and did <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> run the rest of the way. The Orioles scored seven runs {{in the bottom of the}} eighth inining to overcome a 6–0 deficit, and Ruth was the winning pitcher.|$|E

Seismic data suggests that these volcanoes still contain live magma plumbing systems, indicating possible future eruptive activity. Although the available data does <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> clear conclusion, these observations are further indications that some of Canada's volcanoes are potentially active, and that their associated hazards may be significant. The seismic activity correlates both with some of Canada's most youthful volcanoes, and with long-lived volcanic centers with a history of significant explosive behavior, such as the Silverthrone Caldera.|$|E
