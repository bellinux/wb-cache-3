5|$|The Navajo were an Athabaskan {{people who}} {{migrated}} {{from the north}} into the Colorado River basin around 1025 A.D. They soon established themselves as the dominant Native American tribe in the Colorado River basin, and their territory stretched over parts of present-day Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado – in the original homelands of the Puebloans. In fact, the Navajo acquired agricultural skills from the Puebloans before {{the collapse of the}} Pueblo civilization in the 14thcentury. A profusion of other tribes have made a continued, lasting presence along the Colorado River. The Mohave have lived along the rich bottomlands of the lower Colorado below Black Canyon since 1200 A.D. They were fishermen – navigating the river on rafts made of reeds to catch Gila trout and Colorado pikeminnow – and farmers, relying on the annual floods of the river rather than irrigation to water their crops. Ute peoples have inhabited the <b>northern</b> <b>Colorado</b> River basin, mainly in present-day Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, for at least 2,000 years, but did not become well established in the Four Corners area until 1500 A.D. The Apache, Cocopah, Halchidhoma, Havasupai, Hualapai, Maricopa, Pima, and Quechan are among many other groups that live along or had territories bordering on the Colorado River and its tributaries.|$|E

50|$|The Greenback {{cutthroat}} trout was original thought extinct in 1937. However, in the 1950s, scientists found putative greenbacks {{on the eastern}} slopes of the Front and Sawatch ranges in Colorado. A campaign by Colorado Division of Wildlife and several federal agencies introduced these fish to many areas in the trout's former range. In 1996, it was designated as Colorado's state fish. Then in 2012, researchers at the University of Colorado found that the only pure population of these fish was in a small stream in the Arkansas River basin, outside their native range. Since then they have been reintroduced to Zimmerman Lake {{on the edge of}} <b>northern</b> <b>Colorado's</b> Neota Wilderness and Sand Creek in Red Mountain Open Space north of Fort Collins.|$|R
