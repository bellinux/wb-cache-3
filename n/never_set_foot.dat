However, he continued his attempts to regain the Swedish throne, with similar lack of results as his father. He might have been willing to trade his claim away, but the offer was never put down in the negotiations.|$|E
5|$|At dinner, Randyll insults Sam's bookishness, weight, {{and lack}} of {{fighting}} prowess. Gilly defends Sam, mentioning that Sam killed a Thenn and a White Walker. When Sam's brother Dickon insists that White Walkers don't exist, Gilly declares that she saw the act herself, but in doing so reveals her Wildling heritage. Disgusted, Randyll further insults Sam and Gilly, prompting Melessa and Talla {{to leave the room}} with Gilly in anger. Randyll tells Sam that Gilly and Little Sam can remain at Horn Hill, but that he must <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> in Horn Hill again. Sam bids farewell to Gilly, but then changes his mind and decides to bring her and Little Sam with him to the Citadel. As they leave, Sam takes House Tarly's ancestral Valyrian steel sword, Heartsbane, as well.|$|E

25|$|Umberto II {{lived for}} 37 years in exile, in Cascais, Portugal. He <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> {{in his native}} land again; the 1948 {{constitution}} of the Italian Republic not only forbade amending the constitution to restore the monarchy, but until 2002 barred all male heirs to the defunct Italian throne from ever returning to Italian soil. Female members of the Savoy family were not barred, except queens consort.|$|E

On July 24, 1846, Admiral Cécille arrived in Nagasaki, but failed in his {{negotiations}} and was denied landing, and Bishop Forcade <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> in mainland Japan. The Ryu-Kyu court in Naha complained in early 1847 about the presence of the French missionaries, who had to be removed in 1848.|$|E
25|$|Clearly neither Agricola nor {{his successors}} ever conquered Ireland, {{but in recent}} years {{archaeology}} has challenged the belief that the Romans <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> on the island. Roman and Romano-British artefacts have been found primarily in Leinster, notably a fortified site on the promontory of Drumanagh, fifteen miles north of Dublin, and burials on the nearby island of Lambay, both close to where Tuathal Techtmar is supposed to have landed, and other sites associated with Túathal such as Tara and Clogher.|$|E

After studying briefly under Andrea Gastaldi at the Accademia Albertina in Turin, Giacomo Gandi continued his formation independently by making trips to Florence, Rome - where he settled around 1869 - and Parma. He appears to have prided himself in <b>never</b> <b>setting</b> <b>foot</b> in the Accademia di San Luca in Rome, instead training with a painter by the surname Gigi.|$|R

Ignoring her insistent attempts at making him again regular visitor, he <b>never</b> <b>sets</b> <b>foot</b> in the Turkin's house again.|$|R
25|$|In 1324, Odoric of Pordenone, a Franciscan missionary from Friuli, Italy, is {{believed}} {{by some to}} have celebrated a Catholic Mass and baptized natives at Bolinao, Pangasinan. In July 2007, memorial markers were set up in Bolinao to commemorate Odoric's journey based on a publication by Luigi Malamocco, an Italian priest from Friuli, Italy, who claimed that Odoric of Perdenone held the first Catholic Mass in the Philippines in Bolinao, Pangasinan. That 1324 mass would have predated the mass held in 1521 by Ferdinand Magellan, which is generally regarded as the first mass in the Philippines, by some 197 years. However, historian William Henry Scott concluded after examining Oderic's writings about his travels that he likely <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> on Philippine soil and, if he did, {{there is no reason}} to think that he celebrated mass.|$|E
25|$|Macleod was {{appointed}} Secretary of State for the Colonies in October 1959. He had <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> {{in any of}} Britain’s colonies, but the Hola massacre had helped focus his thinking on the inevitable end of Empire. He told Peter Goldman of the Conservative Research Department {{that he intended to}} be the last Colonial Secretary, although he later wrote that he “telescoped events rather than creating new ones”. He saw Nigeria, British Somaliland, Tanganyika, Sierra Leone, Kuwait and British Cameroon become independent. He made a tour of Sub-Saharan Africa in 1960. He would often find himself in conflict with the more conservative Duncan Sandys, whom Macmillan had appointed Commonwealth Secretary as a counterweight to Macleod. Although Macmillan sympathised with Macleod’s aspirations, he was sometimes disturbed at the speed with which he progressed matters, and did not always come down on his side in political disputes.|$|E
25|$|On November 26, 1778, {{explorer}} James Cook {{became the}} first European to see Maui. Cook <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> on the island because {{he was unable to}} find a suitable landing. The first European to visit Maui was the French admiral Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse, who landed on the shores of what is now known as La Perouse Bay on May 29, 1786. More Europeans followed: traders, whalers, loggers (e.g., of sandalwood) and missionaries. The latter began to arrive from New England in 1823, settling in Lahaina, which at that time was the capital. They clothed the natives, banned them from dancing hula, and greatly altered the culture. The missionaries taught reading and writing, created the 12-letter Hawaiian alphabet, started a printing press in Lahaina, and began writing the islands' history, which until then was transmitted orally. Ironically, the missionaries both altered and preserved the native culture. The religious work altered the culture while the literacy efforts preserved native history and language. Missionaries started the first school in Lahaina, which still exists today: Lahainaluna Mission School, which opened in 1831.|$|E

25|$|Dr. Lobsang Sangay, a Fulbright {{scholar and}} {{graduate}} of Harvard Law School {{who was born}} in a refugee camp in India in 1968 and who has <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> in Tibet, was named Prime Minister of the CTA on April 27, 2011. He announced that he would spend his first five-year tenure in Dharamsala, India, the seat of the CTA. There he will not only assume the administrative responsibilities held by the previous PM, but will succeed the Dalai Lama as the political leader of the Tibetan cause, thus ignoring the PRC insistence that the Dalai Lama be succeeded by means of reincarnation, not another method of selection. Sangay, who once was a militant of the Tibetan Youth Congress, a group that unequivocally supports Tibetan independence, says he has matured and now supports the Middle Way Approach. Only about 80,000 Tibetans, half of the registered exile population, were eligible to vote because those living in Nepal were prevented by their host country from participating. The 6 million Tibetans inside Tibet and China did not participate. It is unknown if an exile government not led by the Dalai Lama, who was legitimated by religious tradition, will be viable.|$|E
25|$|Quickly, Alexandra and Peter II fell in {{love and}} planned to marry. Opposition from both Peter's mother, Maria, and the Yugoslav {{government}} in exile forced the couple to delay their marriage plans until 1944, when they finally celebrated their wedding. A year later, Alexandra {{gave birth to her}} only son, Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia. However, the happiness of the family was short-lived: on 29 November 1945, Marshal Tito proclaimed the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Alexandra, who had <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> in her adopted country, was left without a crown. The abolition of the Yugoslav monarchy had very serious consequences for the royal couple. Penniless and unable to adapt to the role of citizen, Peter II turned to alcoholism and multiple affairs with other women. Depressed by the behaviour of her husband, Alexandra neglected her son and made several suicide attempts. After the death of Peter II in 1970, Alexandra's health continued to deteriorate. She died of cancer in 1993 and her remains were buried in the Royal Cemetery Plot in the park of Tatoi in Greece, before being transferred to the Royal Mausoleum of Oplenac in 2013.|$|E
25|$|On paper, the redrawn 17th {{appeared}} to so heavily favor Gekas that it appeared unwinnable for a Democrat, even one as conservative as Holden. To some, it was blatant gerrymandering to force Holden into retirement. Gekas retained 60% {{of his former}} territory, and George W. Bush had carried the newly drawn district with 57% {{of the vote in}} 2000. However, to the surprise of many observers, Holden did not retire, instead opting to run in a district that was 65% new to him (a small corner from the even more Republican 9th District was moved to the 17th). Gekas was forced into his first real campaign ever. Holden managed to gain endorsements from much of Gekas' old base, much to Gekas' surprise. Even Gekas' hometown paper, The Patriot-News, endorsed Holden, saying that the 17th was not the same district that elected Gekas in 1982. Gekas got another rude surprise when Holden visited African American neighborhoods such as Uptown and Allison Hill after finding out that Gekas had <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> in these neighborhoods in his congressional career. He asked the residents of these neighborhoods not to vote for a congressman who didn't bother to visit them. In November 2002, in one of the biggest upsets in recent political history, Holden narrowly defeated Gekas.|$|E

500|$|Dutton {{felt that}} the Rangers were {{responsible}} for the league's refusal to allow the Americans to resume operations, and in a fit of pique, swore that the Rangers would never win another Stanley Cup in his lifetime.

Additionally, he <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> in an NHL arena again until 1980 when, as the last surviving Calgary Tiger, he was asked to drop the puck for the ceremonial faceoff prior to the first game in Calgary Flames' history. Dutton's 34-year separation from the NHL was attributed to the betrayal of the league's owners, but also because Dutton himself found the lure of the game too strong, and knew he had to step away in order to effectively manage his businesses.|$|E

500|$|Gladstone, who had <b>never</b> <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> on his plantation, {{had been}} deluded by his {{attorney}} in Demerara, Frederick Cort, {{into believing that}} it was seldom necessary to punish the slaves. He asserted they were generally happy and contented, {{and were able to}} make considerable money by selling the surplus produce of their provision grounds. Subsequent to the revolt, the secretary of the London Missionary Society warned Gladstone that Cort had been lying, but Gladstone continued to identify himself with Cort and his other agents. Robertson, his second son, inspected the estates from 22 November 1828 to 3 March 1829, during which he observed that Cort was [...] "an idler and a deceiver" [...] who had mismanaged one estate after another. Only then was Cort dismissed. In Britain, Lord Howick and others criticised the concept of absentee landlords. Sir Benjamin d'Urban, who took up his office of Lieutenant Governor of Essequibo and Demerara in 1824, wrote to Earl Bathurst, Secretary of State for the Colonies, on 30 September 1824, criticising [...] "..the injudicious managers under whom too many of the slaves are placed; half educated men of little discretion, or command over their own caprices; good planters perhaps – but quite unfit to have the charge of bodies of men, although they might take very proper care of cattle".|$|E
