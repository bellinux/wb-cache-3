50|$|<b>Northern</b> <b>red</b> oak {{is easy to}} {{recognize}} by its bark, which features bark ridges that appear to have shiny stripes down the center.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to examine the influence of acorn size on morphological characteristics of one-year-old <b>Northern</b> <b>red</b> oak (Quercus rubra L.) seedlings. The quality of seedlings correlates with the quality of the seed they are derived from. In species with large seeds, {{as in the case of}} <b>Northern</b> <b>red</b> oak, the seedling growth in the first growing season is closely related to seed size or the amount of reserve nutrients that are stored in the seed. The height and root collar diameter of one-year-old <b>Northern</b> <b>red</b> oak seedlings increases with increase in acorn size. The results obtained in {{this research}} can be used as a guideline for acorn grading, because they show that improved <b>Northern</b> <b>red</b> oak seedlings quality can be achieved using seeds of appropriate size.

40|$|Bare-root {{seedlings}} of {{pedunculate oak}} (Quercus robur L.) and <b>northern</b> <b>red</b> oak (Quercus rubra L.) were lifted in January and stored at 1. 8 °C, at 82 % relative humidity, until their fresh weight declined by 33 %. Root growth potential (RGP), fine root electrolyte leakage (REL), fine root water content (RWC), shoot tip water content (SWC), starch and metabolic solute contents in root and shoot, were measured just after lifting and after treatment. Survival of treated seedlings was also assessed {{in a field}} trial. RWC, SWC, REL, RGP were dramatically affected by desiccation during cold storage. In both species, root soluble carbohydrate level, inositol level and isocitrate level increased, whereas root starch level and shoot soluble carbohydrate level decreased. In <b>northern</b> <b>red</b> oak, treated seedlings had higher root contents of soluble carbohydrates, inositol and proline than in pedunculate oak. Moreover, treatment induced proline accumulation only in <b>northern</b> <b>red</b> oak roots. These differences could explain why field survival of treated seedlings was significantly better in <b>northern</b> <b>red</b> oak than in pedunculate oak...|$|R

5000|$|The oak {{forests of}} the {{southern}} and central Appalachians consist largely of black, <b>northern</b> <b>red,</b> white, chestnut and scarlet oaks ( [...] and [...] ) and hickories, such as the pignut (...) in particular. The richest forests, which grade into mesic types, usually in coves and on gentle slopes, have dominantly white and <b>northern</b> <b>red</b> oaks, while the driest sites are dominated by chestnut oak, or sometimes by scarlet or <b>northern</b> <b>red</b> oaks. In the northern Appalachians the oaks, except for white and <b>northern</b> <b>red,</b> drop out, while the latter extends farthest north.The oak forests generally lack the diverse small tree, shrub and herb layers of mesic forests. Shrubs are generally ericaceous, and include the evergreen mountain laurel (...) , various species of blueberries ( [...] spp.), black huckleberry (...) , a number of deciduous rhododendrons (azaleas), and smaller heaths such as teaberry (...) and trailing arbutus (...) [...] The evergreen great rhododendron (...) is characteristic of moist stream valleys. These occurrences {{are in line with}} the prevailing acidic character of most oak forest soils. In contrast, the much rarer chinquapin oak (...) demands alkaline soils and generally grows where limestone rock is near the surface. Hence no ericaceous shrubs are associated with it.|$|R

50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>red</b> snapper's body is {{very similar}} in shape to other snappers, such as the {{mangrove}} snapper, mutton snapper, lane snapper, and dog snapper. All feature a sloped profile, medium-to-large scales, a spiny dorsal fin, and a laterally compressed body. <b>Northern</b> <b>red</b> snapper have short, sharp, needle-like teeth, but they lack the prominent upper canine teeth found on the mutton, dog, and mangrove snappers.This snapper reaches maturity at a length of about 39 cm. The common adult length is 60 cm, but may reach 100 cm. The maximum published weight is 84 lb, and the oldest reported age is 100+ years.Coloration of the <b>northern</b> <b>red</b> snapper is light red, with more intense pigment on the back. It has 10 dorsal spines, 14 soft dorsal rays, three anal spines and eight to 9 anal soft rays. Juvenile fish (shorter than 30-35 cm) can also have a dark spot on their sides, below the anterior soft dorsal rays, which fades with age.|$|R

A male and female floral phenology rating system was developed and used to rate phenological overlap (PO) in a <b>northern</b> <b>red</b> oak clonal seed orchard in Indiana, USA in 2008, 2009, and 2010. The mean PO value for each seed orchard pair (n = 146 genotypes) was 0. 30 (range 0 – 0. 98). In each year, phenologically early clones had significantly lower mean PO values than intermediate or late clones. Most clones were dichogamous, with female flowers reaching receptivity an average of 1. 4 – 3 days after male flowers of the same tree. Year explained a significant amount of the variation in clonal dichogamy; genotype was not significant. Yearly variation in spring temperatures strongly affected the placement of clones into phenological classes and the degree of dichogamy and phenological overlap in the seed orchard. ^ Ten clones were chosen from the Indiana, USA <b>northern</b> <b>red</b> oak seed orchard that represented the early, intermediate, and late phenology groups and had offspring in established multi-year progeny tests throughout Indiana.
