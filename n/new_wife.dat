5|$|After {{midnight on}} 29 April, Hitler married Eva Braun {{in a small}} civil {{ceremony}} in the Führerbunker. After a wedding breakfast with his <b>new</b> <b>wife,</b> Hitler dictated his will to his secretary Traudl Junge. The event was witnessed and documents signed by Krebs, Burgdorf, Goebbels, and Bormann. Later that afternoon, Hitler was informed of the execution of Mussolini, which presumably increased his determination to avoid capture.|$|E
5|$|After {{midnight on}} 29 April, with the Soviets {{advancing}} {{ever closer to}} the bunker complex, Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony within the Führerbunker.

5|$|The Philistines were infuriated by the riddle. The thirty groomsmen told Samson's <b>new</b> <b>wife</b> {{that they}} would burn her and her father's {{household}} {{if she did not}} discover the answer to the riddle and tell it to them. At the urgent and tearful imploring of his bride, Samson told her the solution, and she told it to the thirty groomsmen.|$|E
5|$|The {{second floor}} at the now-named Apostolic Faith Mission housed an office and rooms for several {{residents}} including Seymour and his <b>new</b> <b>wife,</b> Jennie. It also had a large prayer room to handle the overflow from the altar services below. The prayer room was furnished with chairs and benches made from California Redwood planks, laid end to end on backless chairs.|$|E
5|$|With {{starting}} {{help from}} his <b>new</b> <b>wife,</b> Andersen started the wood product factory Apenes Trevarefabrikk in Horten, running it for fifteen years. King Haakon VII personally helped him with money and credit, remaining Andersen's friend and patron {{the rest of the}} king's life.

5|$|After {{the war and}} his {{recovery}} from the Chapultepec wound, Longstreet and Louise Garland were officially married on March 8, 1848, and the marriage produced 10 children. He and his <b>new</b> <b>wife</b> served on frontier duty in Texas, primarily at Fort Martin Scott near Fredericksburg and Fort Bliss in El Paso. He performed scouting missions and also served as major and paymaster for the 8th Infantry from July 1858.

5|$|After their wedding, {{the couple}} {{returned}} to Provo, Utah, where Kinne had been attending college, {{but at the}} end of the fall semester, Kinne again put his studies on hold. He and his <b>new</b> <b>wife</b> returned to Independence, where both took jobs—Sharon, babysitting and tending shops, and James as an electrical engineer at Bendix Aviation. Although Sharon claimed to have miscarried the child that had brought about their marriage, she soon became pregnant again. In the fall of 1957, she gave birth to a girl they named Danna.|$|E
5|$|Although {{romantic love}} was not discouraged, marriages were {{arranged}} as agreements and bonds formed between two clans (with property {{as the chief}} concern), not necessarily two individuals. A father's input on who his sons and daughters should marry carried more weight than the mother, although a grandfather could override a father's decision. Once a couple had married, the <b>new</b> <b>wife</b> was obligated to visit the family temple so she could {{become part of the}} husband's clan and be properly worshipped by her descendants after death. However, she retained her natal surname. The vast majority of people during Han practiced monogamy, although wealthy officials and nobles could afford to support one or many concubines in addition to their legal wife.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, Harrison {{traveled}} the Middle East performing medical duties such as treating prostitutes afflicted with venereal disease in Constantinople and operating an X-ray facility in Lod, Israel. Although still not legally divorced {{from his first}} two wives, Harrison married Filomena Abela, a Maltese woman at Alexandria in 1920. However, the newlyweds could not find escape from the adventure that had followed Harrison all his life. Harrison and his <b>new</b> <b>wife's</b> train was ambushed by a band of Syrians disillusioned {{with a group of}} politicians. The quick thinking of the recently thrice-married physician prevented his <b>new</b> <b>wife's</b> broken leg from developing into gangrene.|$|R
50|$|Helen {{still holds}} a flame for James, {{and to his}} infuriation {{frequently}} visits to meddle in his affairs and generally check up on him. Her Italian husband Frank (Stephen Frost) is becoming equally annoyed with his <b>new</b> <b>wife's</b> ways.|$|R
50|$|Emperor Xiaowen {{went as far}} as {{ordering}} his six {{younger brothers}} to demote their current wives to concubine status, and taking the daughters of officials from the five Han clans to be their <b>new</b> <b>wives,</b> an action heavily criticized by historians.|$|R
5|$|At the time, {{there were}} no public art {{galleries}} in England with permanent collections. In 1816, {{in the face of}} his continued lack of success, Etty decided to spend a year in Italy to study the artworks held in the great Italian collections. He had made a brief visit to France in early 1815, but other than this had never been abroad. The 28-year-old Etty had fallen in love, and fretted about the difficulties a potential marriage would cause, and whether it would be right to travel to further his career even though it would mean taking his <b>new</b> <b>wife</b> to a foreign country. In the event, the woman rejected him, and he set out for the Continent in early September 1816.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the Red Army had {{advanced}} to the Potsdamerplatz, and all indications were that they were preparing to storm the Chancellery. This report, combined with Himmler's treachery, prompted Hitler to make the last decisions of his life. After midnight on 29 April, Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony in a map room within the Führerbunker. Afterwards Hitler hosted a modest wedding breakfast with his <b>new</b> <b>wife.</b> Hitler then took secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated his {{last will and testament}}. He signed these documents at 04:00 and then retired to bed (some sources say Hitler dictated the last will and testament immediately before the wedding, but all sources agree on the timing of the signing).|$|E
5|$|Following his Macedonian triumph, Pyrrhus was {{approached}} by his officer Cleonymus. The Spartan convinced the Epiriote king to aid him in a scheme to seize control of his homeland. Cleonymus' reasons for seeking to attack Sparta were twofold. Firstly, he was angry {{that he had been}} overlooked for the Agiad kingship of Sparta in favour of his nephew, Areus II. Plutarch ascribes Cleonymus' failure to secure the throne to his arbitrariness and violent nature. Furthermore, Cleonymus had become a target of ridicule in Sparta by the fact that his <b>new</b> <b>wife,</b> Chilonis, was engaging in an affair with Acrotatus, the son of Areus.|$|E
50|$|Djomo Honore Kamga (polymer engineer) is {{rebuilding}} heritage {{destroyed by}} a fire just after his accession to the throne. In addition to <b>new</b> <b>wives</b> he has the responsibility to take the young widows of his predecessors {{as a sign of}} continuity.|$|R
50|$|William Sykes {{was just}} 23 when, against {{the advice of}} his father he married and then with his own and his <b>new</b> <b>wife's</b> savings {{purchased}} a saddler business in Horbury, England, in about 1870. He married Ethel Marshall, sister of Herbert Marshall and Alice Whitmarsh.|$|R
50|$|In 1987, {{she played}} the title character's mother in the {{short-lived}} Fox series The New Adventures of Beans Baxter. In 1988, she appeared in a Newhart episode ("Courtin' Disaster") and appeared (in a 1989 episode) on The Golden Girls as the <b>newest</b> <b>wife</b> of Dorothy Zbornak's ex-husband.|$|R
5|$|Four years later, Godwin {{remarried}} and his <b>new</b> <b>wife,</b> Mary Jane Clairmont, brought {{two children}} of her own into the marriage, most significantly—from Fanny Imlay and Mary Godwin's perspective—Claire Clairmont. Wollstonecraft's daughters resented the new Mrs Godwin and the attention she paid to her own daughter. The Godwin household became an increasingly uncomfortable place to live as tensions rose and debts mounted. The teenage Mary and Claire escaped by running off to the Continent with Shelley in 1814. Fanny, left behind, bore the brunt of her stepfather's anger. She became increasingly isolated from her family and committed suicide in 1816.|$|E
5|$|In early April 1945, Braun {{travelled}} from Munich to Berlin {{to be with}} Hitler at the Führerbunker. She {{refused to}} leave as the Red Army closed in on the capital. After midnight {{on the night of}} 28–29 April, Hitler and Braun were married in a small civil ceremony within the Führerbunker. The event was witnessed by Joseph Goebbels and Martin Bormann. Thereafter, Hitler hosted a modest wedding breakfast with his <b>new</b> <b>wife.</b> When Braun married Hitler, her legal name changed to Eva Hitler. When she signed her marriage certificate she wrote the letter B for her family name, then lined this out and replaced it with Hitler.|$|E
5|$|John and Josephine deeply {{wish to have}} a {{child and}} when she is born with skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony, they name her Snow White. However, Josephine, Snow White's mother, dies in childbirth, leaving John alone with their child. In the winter, John struggles to find food for his daughter, Snow White, when he sheds a tear over a frozen lake and frees a {{creature}} known as the Green-Eyed One. As thanks for freeing him, Green-Eyed One offers John three wishes. For John's wishes, he asks for nourishment for his daughter, a kingdom to raise his family, and a queen for a <b>new</b> <b>wife,</b> as the creature cannot raise the dead.|$|E
25|$|His {{mother died}} before his first {{birthday}} and his stepmother the next year. From 1910 onwards {{he was in}} the custody of his maternal grandmother Parvathiammal in the neighbouring village of Kallupatti. Parvathiammal was furious on Muthuramalingam's father for having taken two <b>new</b> <b>wives</b> shortly {{after the death of his}} second wife.|$|R
5000|$|Now {{living in}} Massachusetts, in June 1860 the Count Joannes {{filed a lawsuit}} for libel over {{a letter from a}} clergyman {{attempting}} to dissuade a woman from marrying him. He argued his case himself, and, after two trials, received a substantial sum from him. His <b>new</b> <b>wife's</b> given name was [...] "Mary Eliza".|$|R
5000|$|When he married, his <b>new</b> <b>wife's</b> home in London {{was then}} called [...] "Fawkes Hall" [...] (Falkes' Hall), which over the years changed into [...] "Foxhall" [...] and finally into [...] "Vauxhall". The Vauxhall car company derived its name from that part of London and still uses de Breauté's griffin as its badge.|$|R
5|$|Napoleon {{turned his}} focus to {{domestic}} affairs after the war. Empress Joséphine had still not {{given birth to}} a child from Napoleon, who became worried about the future of his empire following his death. Desperate for a legitimate heir, Napoleon divorced Joséphine in January 1810 and started looking for a <b>new</b> <b>wife.</b> Hoping to cement the recent alliance with Austria through a family connection, Napoleon married the Archduchess Marie Louise, who was 18 years old at the time. On 20 March 1811, Marie Louise gave birth to a baby boy, whom Napoleon made heir apparent and bestowed the title of King of Rome. His son never actually ruled the empire, but historians still refer to him as Napoleon II.|$|E
5|$|Nargis was the director's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Radha, and despite only being aged 26 at the time, she played the role of the <b>new</b> <b>wife,</b> young single mother and an aged mother of two sons. Nargis—the reigning queen of Hindi cinema at the time—had started her career in a leading role with Khan's Taqdeer (1943) and acted under his {{direction}} in Humayun (1945) and Andaz (1949). Mother India is generally regarded as Nargis's best performance and was her last major film before retirement after marriage.|$|E
5|$|On 10 July 1137 Pain {{was killed}} by a javelin blow to the head during an ambush by the Welsh as he was leading a relief {{expedition}} to the garrison at Carmarthen. He was buried in Gloucester Abbey, following a funeral service conducted by Robert de Bethune. A number of barons from the Welsh Marches attended, including Miles of Gloucester. Pain's widow continued to hold Ludlow Castle until the middle of 1139, when she was forced to surrender it to King Stephen. Stephen then gave Sybil in marriage to Jocelin de Dinan, who consequently acquired Ludlow Castle through his <b>new</b> <b>wife,</b> setting up the background to Gilbert Lacy's attempts to seize Ludlow from Dinan on which the medieval Welsh romance work Fouke le Fitz Waryn is based.|$|E

50|$|When {{resources}} were plentiful, several tents would travel {{together as a}} goum. These groups were sometimes linked by patriarchal lineage, but were just as likely linked by marriage (<b>new</b> <b>wives</b> were especially likely to have close male relatives join them), acquaintance, or no clearly defined relation but a simple shared membership in the tribe.|$|R
