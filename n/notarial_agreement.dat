The Catholics were furthermore granted the sole right to use the quire with its High Altar, the two side altars and the confessionals. This simultaneum was dissolved by a <b>notarial</b> <b>agreement</b> with both denominations’ assent on 15 June 1965, and a new arrangement was put in place: the Evangelical parish sold the Catholic parish its one-half share in the church, which allowed the former to make possible a new church building, the Friedenskirche (“Peace Church”) with a community centre. A further ruling allowed the Evangelical parish to use Saint Michael’s Church, as before, until its own church was ready for use, and further still, it allowed the Catholic parish to be guests at the Friedenskirche as long as thorough restoration work was being undertaken at Saint Michael’s and its tower and until preliminary archaeological digs by the Koblenz Office for Prehistory and Protohistory (Amt für Vor- und Frühgeschichte, Koblenz) were over. All work was complete on 6 July 1969.|$|E

Its aim is to preview the common assets of spouses {{from the perspective of a}} notary, who acts in the position of the impartial and independent person, equipped with professional knowledge. The rigorous thesis is divided into six chapters. The first chapter describes the legal regulation of the common assets of spouses.

In the fifth chapter I describe some of the European legislation of the marital property law. The sixth chapter deals with the amendment of the Civil Code in relation to the common assets of spouses...|$|R
