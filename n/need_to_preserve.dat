While {{it may be}} {{too much}} to speak of a renaissance in traditional Norwegian architecture, more and more urban planning is affected by the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> or restore these traditions.

5|$|On 19 August, Göring {{read the}} {{reports on the}} losses of 18 August, and unhappy with {{the extent of the}} losses, {{recalled}} both pilots. Hitler's Directive 17 had ordered the Luftwaffe to achieve air superiority, but remain strong enough for when, or rather if, Sea Lion was launched. Moreover, Göring recognised that the Luftwaffe was his power base. A failure would be damaging, but a severe weakening of the Luftwaffe would be far worse. He emphasised to his commanders the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> the Luftwaffe's strength. Essentially, the core theme of the conference was fighter protection. The fighter leaders advocated sweeps to clear the skies in advance of attacks. Other commanders present thought a combination of sweeps and close escort would be more effective in reducing losses. Göring agreed and listed a number of forms that the sweeps could take. The most important tactical change he made was instituting a wholesale purge of older Geschwaderkommodore in favour of younger men. From now on, leaders were to be drawn from the ranks, given responsibility based on skill and experience rather than rank, while allowing them to have a free rein in tactical engagements (a form of aerial Auftragstaktik).|$|E

25|$|The {{method for}} {{creating}} century eggs likely came about through the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> eggs {{in times of}} plenty by coating them in alkaline clay, {{which is similar to}} methods of egg preservation in some Western cultures. The clay hardens around the egg and results in the curing and creation of century eggs instead of spoiled eggs.|$|E
25|$|This {{was also}} a period of social {{upheaval}} in Ireland, with frequent strikes {{as well as other}} manifestations of class conflict. In this regard, the IRA acted to a large degree as an agent of social control and stability, driven by the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> cross-class unity in the national struggle, and on occasion being used to break strikes.|$|E
25|$|During {{the second}} half of the 20th century, {{producers}} using selective breeding focused on creating livestock breeds and crossbreeds that increased production, while mostly disregarding the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> genetic diversity. This trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds, leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds.|$|E

25|$|Traffic {{lights and}} {{junctions}} are permitted at grade on dual carriageways. For older sections of dual carriageway, this {{has resulted in}} fewer flyover junctions. Newer dual carriageway sections are usually near motorway standard, with grade-separated junctions, but may not be designated as motorways due to the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> access to adjoining property or {{to the absence of}} a non-motorway alternative route. Also, dual carriageways that are not motorway classified {{do not need to be}} equipped with emergency phones.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{mindful of}} the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> their {{reputation}} for safety, the railway company allowed only the overall timings for the run {{to be put into}} print; neither The Times report of the following day nor Rous-Marten's article in The Railway Magazine of June 1904 mentioned the maximum speed. However, the morning after the run two local Plymouth newspapers did report that the train had reached a speed between 99 and 100 miles an hour whilst descending Wellington Bank, Somerset. This claim was based on the stopwatch timings of a postal worker, William Kennedy, who was also on the train.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant General Erwin Rommel ordered German {{armoured}} divisions to the Axis fortress {{positions on}} the Egyptian border but failed to find {{the main body of}} the Allied infantry, which had bypassed the fortresses and headed for Tobruk. Rommel had to withdraw from the frontier to Tobruk and achieved some tactical success in costly fighting. The <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> his remaining forces from destruction prompted Rommel to withdraw his army to the defensive line at Gazala, west of Tobruk and then all the way back to El Agheila.

25|$|Santería is {{a system}} of beliefs that merges aspects of Yoruba {{religion}} brought to the New World by enslaved Yoruba people along with Christianity and the religions of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. The Yoruba people carried with them various religious customs, including a trance and divination system for communicating with their ancestors and deities, animal sacrifice, and sacred drumming and dance. The <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> their traditions and belief systems in a hostile cultural environment prompted those enslaved in Cuba, starting from as early as 1515, to merge their customs with aspects of Roman Catholicism.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, the {{development}} of poetry in the American colonies mirrors {{the development}} of the colonies themselves. The early poetry is dominated by the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> the integrity of the Puritan ideals that created the settlement in the first place. As the colonists grew in confidence, the poetry they wrote increasingly reflected their drive towards independence. This shift in subject matter was not reflected in the mode of writing which tended to be conservative, to say the least. This {{can be seen as a}} product of the physical remove at which American poets operated from the center of English-language poetic developments in London.|$|E
25|$|Operation Crusader (4th Indian, 7th Armoured, 1st South African, 2nd New Zealand and 70th British divisions) between 18 November–30 December 1941. The initial {{plan was}} to destroy the Axis {{armoured}} force before advancing its infantry. 7th Armoured were heavily defeated by the Afrika Korps at Sidi Rezegh. Rommel's subsequent advance of his armoured divisions to the Axis fortress positions on the Egyptian border failed to find {{the main body of}} the Allied infantry, which had bypassed the fortresses and headed for Tobruk, so Rommel had to withdraw his armoured units to support the fighting at Tobruk. Despite achieving some tactical successes at Tobruk, the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> his remaining forces prompted Rommel to withdraw his army to the defensive line at Gazala, west of Tobruk, and then all the way back to El Agheila.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{distinction}} between traditional Sephardic and Mizrahi cuisines {{can be difficult}} to make, due to the intermingling of the Sephardi diaspora and the Mizrahi Jews who they came in contact with. As a general rule, however, both types reflect the food of the local non-Jewish population that each group lived amongst. The <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> kashrut does lead to a few significant changes (most notably, the use of olive oil instead of animal fat is often considered to be a legacy of Jewish residency in an area, {{due to the fact that}} olive oil may be eaten with milk, unlike animal fat). Despite this, Sephardic and Ashkenazic concepts of kosher differ; perhaps the most notable difference being that rice, a major staple of the Sephardic diet, is considered kosher for Passover among Sephardim but it is forbidden as kitniyot by most Ashkenazim.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} public–private {{partnership}} {{arrangement for}} maintenance of the London Underground, the station was due to be refurbished by Metronet. Following the collapse of Metronet, responsibility of station upkeep was transferred to Transport for London in 2008. Works were planned to include provision of tactile strips and colour contrasted handrails for the visually impaired, installation of closed-circuit television cameras, passenger help points, new electronic departure information displays on the platforms, a new public address system, and improved lighting. Transport for London has assigned the station to the 'limited works' category and plans to complete these improvements incrementally, according to the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> assets.

In December 1981 he attempted {{to solve the problem of}} Michael Foot's denunciation of Peter Tatchell (who had been selected as Labour candidate for Bermondsey) by holding a quick enquiry, but this attempt failed when Foot loyalists passed a motion to refuse Tatchell endorsement. Heffer's attempts to mediate between the Bermondsey Party and Foot were regarded as 'paternalist' by Tatchell and his local supporters. Heffer also joined with Foot and Denis Healey in an NEC motion calling for negotiations with the United Nations Secretary-General after the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands on 28 April 1982, in opposition to a motion from Tony Benn calling for a ceasefire and withdrawal of the British taskforce.|$|E

25|$|Funds {{available}} to the development and maintenance of affordable housing are scarce and, {{in order to maximize}} the supply of housing, low construction costs are often favored in choosing projects. However, one of the main arguments for green affordable housing is that a higher upfront cost for construction/renovation can be motivated by a lower operating cost over the life-time of the building, i.e. a lower life-cycle cost. If the initial investment leads to lower operating costs and/or higher durability the higher upfront capital cost needed for construction or renovation can be justified. This is especially true considering that public funding and tax breaks (like the low-income housing tax credit) for housing often require a longer term perspective from its builders. However, the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> affordability of housing sometimes restricts value enhancement over time and may thus be a barrier to investing in green features.|$|E
25|$|Uppermost in {{the minds}} of the Spanish ministers was the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> their empire intact and put it in hands {{powerful}} enough to guarantee that integrity. The preservation of the whole empire for the next generation of Spaniards was the driving motive in the last months of Charles II's life, but the grandees, led by Cardinal Portocarrero, knew that militarily their country was at the mercy of neighbouring France and that Austria, lacking a navy, could not hope to validate its claims. Consequently, Charles II, pressed on his sick-bed by his ministers, signed his final will on 3 October 1700, annulling the renunciations imposed on Maria Theresa and fixing the entire inheritance on the younger grandson of Louis XIV, Philip, Duke of Anjou. As Philip was not immediately in line for the French throne (the Dauphin and the Duke of Burgundy stood between him and the crown), the Spanish government hoped that this arrangement would be acceptable to European states who feared the unification of the French and Spanish thrones under a single monarch. If Philip should die or refuse, the offer was to extend to his younger brother, the Duke of Berry; if they both refused, the undivided inheritance would be offered to Archduke Charles.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1980s, {{there has}} been a greater {{awareness}} among Dublin's planners of the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> Dublin's architectural heritage. Preservation orders have been put on most of Dublin's Georgian neighbourhoods. The new awareness was also reflected in the development of Temple Bar, the last surviving part of Dublin that contained its original medieval street plan. In the 1970s, Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ), the state transport company, bought up many of the buildings in this area, with a view to building a large modern central bus station on the site with a shopping centre attached. However, most of the buildings had been rented by artists, producing a sudden and unexpected appearance of a 'cultural quarter' that earned comparisons with Paris's Left Bank. The vibrancy of the Temple Bar area led to demands for its preservation. By the late 1980s, the bus station plans were abandoned and a master plan was put in place to maintain Temple Bar's position as Dublin's cultural heartland, with large-scale government support. That process has been a mixed success. While the medieval street plan has survived, rents have rocketed, forcing the artists elsewhere. They have been replaced by restaurants and bars which draw thousands of tourists but which has been criticised for over commercialisation and excessive alcohol consumption. Also, in the late 1980s the Grafton and Henry street areas were pedestrianised.|$|E
