5|$|In 1995 a {{longitudinal}} study was conducted at the University of Kansas, the first large-scale evaluation of Sesame Street's cognitive effects in over twenty years. Its findings supported those of previous studies: early viewing of educational children's television appeared to contribute to children's school readiness. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds learned as much as advantaged children per hour of viewing, but they did <b>not</b> <b>watch</b> enough to gain the program's maximum benefit. In comparing the effects of watching Sesame Street with other programs, commercial entertainment and cartoons had a negative effect; watching Sesame Street daily did not increase children's viewing of other categories of television, nor make them less likely to participate in other educational activities.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the broadcast of Part One, there was widespread debate among fans of the series as to who shot Mr. Burns. Fox offered a contest to tie in with the mystery where callers who dialed 1-800-COLLECT were eligible and they then guessed who the culprit was. It ran from August 13 to September 10 {{and was one of}} the first contests to tie together elements of television and the Internet. Fox launched a new website, www.Springfield.com, devoted to the mystery which got over 500,000 hits during the summer of 1995. The winner would be animated on an episode of the show. Due to contest regulations, a winner had to be selected out of a random sample of entries. The sample did not contain any correct answers, and so a winner (who had the wrong answer) was chosen at random. However, the winner, Fayla Gibson of Washington D.C., did <b>not</b> <b>watch</b> the show and opted to accept a cash prize in lieu of being animated.|$|E
5|$|Speculation also {{surrounded}} whether former series star Kristin Kreuk would reprise {{her role}} as Lana Lang. Prior to the episode's broadcast, Kreuk ignited a minor controversy by noting {{that she would not}} be watching the episode when it aired, giving some fans the impression that she was avoiding the show. Kruek released a statement on her Facebook page, clarifying that, even when she was a star on Smallville, she did <b>not</b> <b>watch</b> the episodes when they aired. Kreuk stated that Peterson and Souders never approached her about being in the finale, and that she was glad that they had not, because she was fond of how Lana's story arc ended in season eight.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{budget was}} so small that during the 32 days of {{shooting}} in Eugene, mostly in November, Landis had no trailer or office and could <b>not</b> <b>watch</b> dailies for three weeks. His wife Deborah Nadoolman purchased most of the costumes at local thrift stores, and she and Judy Belushi made the party togas. Landis and Bruce McGill staged a scene for reporters visiting the set where the director pretended to be angry at the actor for being difficult on the set. Landis grabbed a breakaway pitcher and smashed it over McGill's head. He {{fell to the ground}} and pretended to be unconscious. The reporters were completely fooled, and when Landis asked McGill to get up, he refused to move.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack for Silent Hill was {{composed}} by sound director Akira Yamaoka, who requested {{to join the}} development staff after the original musician had left. In addition to the music, {{he was in charge}} of tasks such as sound effect creation and audio mastering. Yamaoka did <b>not</b> <b>watch</b> game scenes, but created the music independently from its visuals. The style of his compositions was influenced by Twin Peaks composer Angelo Badalamenti. To differentiate Silent Hill from other games as much as possible, and to give it a cold and rusty feel, Yamaoka opted for industrial music. When he presented his musical pieces to the other staff members for the first time, they misinterpreted their sound as a game bug. Yamaoka had to explain that this noise was intended for the music, and the team only withdrew their initial objection after he elaborated on his reasons for choosing this style.|$|E

25|$|The third {{test was}} far more equal, with Australia being victorious due to a 251 run {{partnership}} between Serjeant and Wood in their second innings. It was a close run result with Australia having to score 69 runs {{on the final day}} with 4 wickets in hand – Simpson later said he was so anxious he could <b>not</b> <b>watch</b> the game. However Australia got home by three wickets.|$|E
25|$|Smithsonian Institution Curator of Aeronautics Peter L. Jakab {{said that}} Whitehead's {{wife and family}} {{did not know about}} his August 1901 flights. Mrs. Whitehead, in talking to Randolph, said that she sewed the {{material}} for the wings on the plane and took care of the household, and did <b>not</b> <b>watch</b> any experiments. Whitehead's daughter Rose was three years old when the alleged 1901 powered flight took place, and the other children had not yet been born.|$|E

Following the tournament, McIlroy went on to admit his surprise at how successful it had been, and that he had been wrong to dismiss it.|$|E

When he went to Kakinada in what is now Andhra Pradesh, he agreed to be a guest of Pyda Ramakrishnayya, a Kamti by caste, and who was leading a campaign for remarriage of widows. The Brahmins of the town were so enraged that they decided to force him to quit the place. At Rajahmundry he met Kandukuri Veeresalingam Pantulu, the renowned reformer.|$|E

After he met Byrd, his band gave him a videotape of Debbie Does Dallas as a present for his birthday.

According to tradition, she arrives {{in the company of a}} donkey and her escort, Castaldo. Children are asked to leave some coffee for Lucia, a carrot for the donkey and a glass of wine for Castaldo.

25|$|Peggy Fowler {{was born}} in Nampa, Idaho, on July 14, 1951. The {{daughter}} of a Quaker minister, {{she grew up in}} Oregon, first in Portland. Fowler was the youngest of five children in the family, with the next oldest nine years older than she was. Growing up in a religious household, she did <b>not</b> <b>watch</b> TV at home until around age 10, and did not attend a movie until reaching college. From the age of two until five she wore an eye patch over her right eye and is legally blind in one eye. While in fifth grade the family moved from Portland to Hillsboro, Oregon, a suburb to the west. In school she excelled in math and played the flute, while hoping to become a scientist.|$|E
25|$|The WWF would tour {{nationally in}} a venture {{that would require}} a huge capital investment, one that placed the WWF {{on the verge of}} {{financial}} collapse. The future of McMahon's experiment came down to {{the success or failure of}} McMahon's groundbreaking concept, WrestleMania. WrestleMania was a major success, and was (and still is) marketed as the Super Bowl of professional wrestling. The concept of a wrestling supercard was nothing new in North America; the NWA had begun running Starrcade a few years prior. In McMahon's eyes, however, what separated WrestleMania from other supercards was that it was intended to be accessible to those who did <b>not</b> <b>watch</b> wrestling. He invited celebrities such as Mr. T, Muhammad Ali, and Cyndi Lauper to participate in the event, as well as securing a deal with MTV to provide coverage. The event and hype surrounding it led to the term Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection, due to the cross-promotion of pop-culture and professional wrestling.|$|E
25|$|In {{a gloomy}} bar, Raoul contemplates his {{relationship}} with Christine. He is joined by Meg, who tells him she swims each day to wash away the stress of working. She tells Raoul that he must leave with Christine and Gustave and {{runs out of the}} bar ("Why Does She Love Me?"). Raoul says he is not afraid of the Phantom. Suddenly, the Phantom reveals himself to Raoul and they make a bet that if Christine sings, the Phantom wins and if she doesn't, Raoul wins. If Raoul wins the bet, the Phantom will pay his debts and Raoul can leave with Christine and Gustave. However, if The Phantom wins, Christine and Gustave will remain in America with him and Raoul must return to Paris alone. The Phantom also leads Raoul to question Gustave's paternity ("Devil Take the Hindmost"). Fleck, Squelch and Gangle appear to advertise Christine's appearance at Phantasma ("Invitation to the Concert"). That night, Meg performs a strip-tease about her choice of swimming costumes ("Bathing Beauty"). She successfully impresses the audience, but Madame Giry reveals to Meg that the Phantom did <b>not</b> <b>watch</b> the performance, saying it was for nothing ("Mother, Did You Watch?").|$|E

25|$|Ridgway {{was arrested}} in 1982 and 2001 on charges related to prostitution. He became {{a suspect in the}} Green River killings in 1983. In 1984, Ridgway took and passed a {{polygraph}} test (quality control protocols later developed in the FBI after careful review determined that Ridgway actually failed his polygraph test), and on April 7, 1987, police took hair and saliva samples from Ridgway. Around 1985, Ridgway began dating Judith Mawson, who became his third wife in 1988. Mawson claimed in a 2010 television interview that when she moved into his house while they were dating, there was no carpet. Detectives later told her he had probably wrapped a body in the carpet. In the same interview, she described how he would leave for work early in the morning some days, ostensibly for the overtime pay. Mawson speculated that he must have committed some of the murders while supposedly working these early morning shifts. She claimed that she had not suspected Ridgway's crimes before she was contacted by authorities in 1987, and had not even heard of the Green River Killer before that time because she did <b>not</b> <b>watch</b> the news.|$|E
