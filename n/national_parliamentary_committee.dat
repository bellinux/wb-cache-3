50|$|The {{project team}} started by {{examining}} the road traffic rules that were in place in each jurisdiction. Detailed public consultations were also {{a feature of the}} policy development process. By 1996, arguably most of the policy basis for the Australian Road Rules was settled. Yet there was still widespread dissatisfaction with the state of the draft Rules at that point. Many thought the document was unenforceable and therefore useless as a template or model law. And so, the group worked very intensively through 1997 and 1998 to ensure that the Rules were not only satisfactory in a policy sense but crucially were drafted {{in such a way that}} they were enforceable. In effect, the Rules were completely redrafted using the dedicated resources of the Commonwealth Office of Legislative Drafting who liaised with the <b>national</b> <b>Parliamentary</b> Counsel’s <b>Committee</b> as the representatives of State, Territory and Commonwealth parliamentary drafters.|$|R

40|$|Context: <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>committees</b> {{established}} in Westminster parliaments, such as Queensland, provide a cross-party structure that {{enables them to}} recommend policy and legislative changes that may otherwise be difficult for one party to recommend. The overall <b>parliamentary</b> <b>committee</b> process tends to be more cooperative and less adversarial than the main chamber of parliament and, as a result, this process permits <b>parliamentary</b> <b>committees</b> to make recommendations more on the available research evidence and less on political or party considerations. Objectives: This paper considers the contributions that <b>parliamentary</b> <b>committees</b> in Queensland have made in the past in the areas of road safety, drug use as well as organ and tissue donation. The paper also discusses the importance of researchers actively engaging with <b>parliamentary</b> <b>committees</b> to ensure the best evidence based policy outcomes. Key messages: In the past, <b>parliamentary</b> <b>committees</b> have successfully facilitated important safety changes with many committee recommendations based on research results. In order to maximise the benefits of the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>committee</b> process it is essential that researchers inform committees about their work and become key stakeholders in the inquiry process. Researchers can keep committees informed by making submissions to their inquiries, responding to requests for information and appearing as witnesses at public hearings. Researchers should emphasise the key findings and implications of their research as well as considering the jurisdictional implications and political consequences. It is important that researchers understand the differences between lobbying and providing informed recommendations when interacting with committees. Discussion and conclusions: <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>committees</b> in Queensland have successfully assisted in the introduction of evidence based policy and legislation. In order to present best practice recommendations, committees rely on the evidence presented to them including the results of researchers. Actively engaging with <b>parliamentary</b> <b>committees</b> will help researchers to turn their results into practice with a corresponding decrease in injuries and fatalities. Developing an understanding of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>committees,</b> and the typical inquiry process used by these committees, will help researchers to present their research results in a manner that will encourage the adoption of their ideas by <b>parliamentary</b> <b>committees,</b> the presentation of these results as recommendations within the report and the subsequent enactment of the committee’s recommendations by the government. ...|$|R
