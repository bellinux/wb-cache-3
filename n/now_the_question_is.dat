2500|$|It {{was this}} period, that the Revolutionary Democratic Group were {{expelled}} and became in their words, [...] "an external faction". The SWP {{was involved in}} the relaunch the ANL in 1992 in response to the growth of the British National Party and campaigned against the Criminal Justice Bill. A demonstration for justice for murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence near the BNP headquarters in Welling in 1993 turned into a violent confrontation with the police, leading to criticism from Ken Livingstone, then a Labour MP and a supporter of the rival Anti-Racist Alliance (ARA), in which Socialist Action plaed a major role. Livingstone argued that this kind of action was playing {{into the hands of the}} BNP. He said at the time: [...] "'No one's discussing [...] policies. <b>Now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> the violence of the SWP, arguments between the police and the SWP about who is to blame." [...] Although Stephen's mother Doreen Lawrence attended the Welling demo, she came to realise that the ANL was a [...] "front for the Socialist Workers Party". She later wrote that [...] "the various groups that had taken an interest in Stephen's death were tearing each other apart and were in danger of destroying our campaign which we wanted to keep focused and dignified", and Doreen and Neville Lawrence wrote to both the ANL and ARA to demand that they [...] "stop using Stephen's name".|$|E
6000|$|... “Not {{necessarily}} with her,” objected Rudolph. “Let us say the two nurses {{have also}} disappeared. <b>Now,</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> why?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> {{what we can}} do to {{give them}} some little glimpse of social gaiety. That's what they've come for." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> being handed in, {{written on}} strips of paper, {{and at last}} that listener's {{difficulty}} cropped up.|$|R
6000|$|Somewhere about midnight {{we reached}} the {{neighbourhood}} of this place. How near or how far we were from it, we could not tell since the moon was invisible, as of course the smoke was in <b>the</b> dark. <b>Now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was,</b> what should we do? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> had <b>been</b> asked, {{and it was}} Martha's duty to reply.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--and <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> {{will you}} take {{the part of the}} Nurse or not in the dramatics?" [...] asked Mrs. Munger, {{returning}} to business.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've wished {{a hundred}} times they hadn't asked us; but it's too late {{to think about that}} <b>now.</b> <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> {{what are we going to}} do about Penelope?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Such, friends, is the {{disaster}} sad Which has befel the Cal. Acad. And <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> of more Importance {{than it was}} before: Shall vacancies among us be To idiots threw open free?" ...|$|E
30|$|<b>Now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> becomes: <b>is</b> there {{room for}} an agreement? We shall see {{that the answer is}} positive, {{provided}} agents are risk averse.|$|R
5000|$|Returning to {{the subject}} of Gibson's banged-up legs during a replay, Scully joked, [...] And, <b>now,</b> <b>the</b> only <b>question</b> <b>was,</b> could he make it around the base paths unassisted?! ...|$|R
50|$|Better {{news from}} down-under was that Les Sharpe was going like a rocket! He'd made big scores against the visiting English tourists, and scored well almost everywhere, {{way ahead of}} {{previous}} seasons. If he kept that form going in England the management's prayers would have been well and truly answered.It was almost the same with Greg Kentwell who'd gone really well in the Australian Test Matches until suffering a bad ankle injury that curtailed his Winter racing. <b>Now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> whether he'd be fit and whether he'd retain that sparkling form.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my lord, of course; {{that was}} the reason. So you put Arthur into the living, and you {{allocated}} the income to me. That is all settled. But <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> about the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Socratic {{method is}} irresistible," [...] said the {{minister}} sadly. [...] "You have proved {{that nothing can}} be done for Barker with the Vanes. And <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> {{what can be done}} for him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Father Tiebout smiled good-humoredly. [...] "We {{will not}} discuss the point just <b>now.</b> <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> what must be done? We {{have a friend who}} will walk {{straight}} into the jaws of the lion unless--some one--warns him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{instructions}} don't go to that," [...] the constable answered; [...] "my {{instructions are}} that you're {{to keep moving}} on. <b>Now</b> <b>the</b> simple <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> sir," [...] turning to Mr. Snagsby, [...] "whether you know him. He says you do." ...|$|R
3000|$|... {{which means}} that, in {{the limit of}} low coupling, the Green {{function}} can be written as a sum of resonances, and furthermore, the parameters of interest have simple expressions. <b>Now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> whether <b>the</b> above formula contains information about the phase evolution between resonances, more precisely about the presence (absence) of a phase lapse. Keeping in mind that the Green function (Equation 4) is a complex number, a phase lapse with Π appears if both the real and the imaginary part change their sign simultaneously. This means that, in turn, the Green function has a zero at the phase lapse position, so one has to look for the zeros of the Green function.|$|R
5000|$|PK: The titular {{character}} was written to be a Chaplinesque, bumbling alien and meant {{to provide an}} outside view to the quirks and hypocrisies of the Indian society. To further accentuate the alien look, Khan developed a distinct appearance and mannerisms including wearing green contact lenses and not blinking while talking. Khan also learned Bhojpuri for the role {{with the help of}} the language expert Shanti Bhushan. Rajkumar Hirani said in an interview, “When we write a script we usually visualise the characters in the film. How they look, talk and walk. But PK is one such character which was very difficult to visualize. We didn’t have a reference point. PK was one such character, who didn’t have a reference point. A character like him wasn’t there in any book, nor did we meet someone like him in real life. We only knew that we wanted the character to be innocent and child-like. <b>Now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was,</b> who is that actor who could look like a Child. Someone who is perfect for the role of PK. The answer was obvious - Aamir Khan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{should have}} taken {{somebody}} to New York with him," [...] put in Sam. [...] "But it's no use talking about that <b>now.</b> <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> What {{are we going to}} do? I can't stay here and study when he is missing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; yes, {{it must be}} so," [...] Matt insisted. [...] "But <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> how {{to reach}} him, and make some {{beginning}} of the end with him. I suppose it's the suspense and the uncertainty that is breaking your sister down?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{we have to}} {{wait for}} the Artesian ray," [...] she said, [...] "we must try to carry out {{something}} else. People are watching us, talking of us, expecting something of us; we must give them something. <b>Now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> what shall that be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Well, sir; I've made inquiry of a Sidlinch {{woman as}} to his burial, and what I thought seems true. They buried en wi' a new six-foot hurdle-saul drough's body, from the {{sheep-pen}} up in North Ewelease though they won't own to it <b>now.</b> And <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> Is <b>the</b> moving worth while, considering the awkwardness?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "However, that <b>is</b> not <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> It <b>is</b> evident, by this daring deed of Glendower, {{that he will}} be busy this year; and {{the success}} of his first attempt will assuredly add to his following. Therefore, as the Scots are, at present, quiet, I would that you ride again to Ludlow, and sojourn there a while.|$|R
40|$|In the Middle ages social {{security}} {{was largely a}} matter for the guilds. When the guilds were abolished, insurance companies partly assumed this responsibility. Later, the Government demanded that it should take over. <b>Now,</b> <b>the</b> key <b>question</b> <b>is</b> how responsibilities can be divided {{between the public and}} the private sector. Lessons from history. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It don't {{make any}} {{difference}} how the money came in {{so long as you}} have got it," [...] Dan replied, philosophically, [...] "an' <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> what are we to do for supper, since we paid our bill at the boarding-house this afternoon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{came down}} here to see Pelter, Japson & Company, that's certain," [...] remarked Dick. [...] "It eras evidently the only reason why he came to New York. <b>Now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> Did he go and see those men, and did they waylay him, or did they hire {{somebody}} to do it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all: he was {{not only}} {{speaking}} seriously, but he told me what I'm very sure was the truth, as far as Lord Kilcullen was concerned. I mean, I'm sure Kilcullen said it, and in the most public manner he could; and <b>now,</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> what had I better do?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was,</b> ought he {{to see her}} again? He had his doubts. But, {{unfortunately}} for discretion, just when he {{was coming out of}} the rooms he had encountered an old lady of seventy, his friend Mrs. Brightwalton--the Honourable Mrs. Brightwalton--and she had hastily asked him to dinner for the day after the morrow, stating in the honest way he knew so well that she had heard he was out of town, or she would have asked him two or three weeks ago. Now, of all social things that Pierston liked it was to be asked to dinner off-hand, as a stopgap in place of some bishop, earl, or Under-Secretary who couldn't come, and when the invitation was supplemented by the tidings that the lady who had so impressed him was {{to be one of the}} guests, he had promised instantly.|$|R
60|$|As {{a matter}} of course we had lost all {{knowledge}} of time, shut up in that cellar where no ray of light penetrated, sleeping and eating as our desires prompted, and <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> had <b>been</b> raised I grew keen to know whether another night had come, or if we had been there as prisoners less than four and twenty hours.|$|R
3000|$|... is a metric (see [19, Lemma[*] 3.1]). <b>Now,</b> <b>the</b> {{following}} <b>question</b> can <b>be</b> risen. Is {{it possible}} to consider two disjoint Chebyshev sets, instead of one Chebyshev set [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] Dr. Beddersley answered. [...] "That is {{just what}} I should expect. <b>Now,</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> {{do you know him}} to be one man, or is he really a gang? Is he a name for a syndicate? Have you any {{photographs}} of Colonel Clay himself in any of his disguises?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{one thing}} is clear," [...] remarked Tom. [...] "We have got to find dad, and do it pretty quickly, too. We know-- or, at least, we are pretty sure of it-- {{that he is in}} the power of Crabtree and Pelter, Japson & Company. <b>Now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> What {{are we going to do}} about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whiskey, that's what. It's {{a hell of}} a {{thing to}} say, but I can't let liquor alone when I can smell it. I'm no common hand, or I wouldn't be if I--But let that go. I can swing an axe, and I'm ready to work. That's enough. <b>Now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> can you find a place for me?" ...|$|E
60|$|But just <b>now,</b> <b>the</b> main <b>question</b> <b>was,</b> Could {{they reach}} the Jeffer place? The boys had the way fairly well fixed in their heads, but walking was hard and treacherous. On the level, the snow {{was at least a}} foot deep, while they ran the risk of going down in deep hollows filled by the wind.|$|R
50|$|Ned is now {{convinced}} that Barley {{has made a}} deal to turn over <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> to <b>the</b> USSR. Russell disagrees and instructs the assignment to proceed as planned. The British-American team expects the meeting with Yakov to last a short time, but when Barley doesn't return after seven hours, Russell admits he was wrong. <b>The</b> team must <b>now</b> pretend <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> deliberately false.|$|R
25|$|Expert {{opinion on}} the {{limitations}} of flushing foxes to birds of prey {{will be available to}} advise courts considering such cases, when they <b>are</b> litigated. For <b>now,</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of what <b>is</b> lawful remains to be determined.|$|R
