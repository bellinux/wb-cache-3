(Pinaceae), {{found in}} the Himalayan region, furnishes an oleo-resin which is used <b>as</b> <b>insecticides,</b> <b>disinfectants</b> and liver disorders. P. roxburghii are {{reported}} to have wound healing, cytotoxic, antibacterial, antifungal and spasmolytic actions. The plant also shows beneficial effects {{in the treatment of}} cough, ulceration and genito-urinary disorders. Folklore reports suggest its use in inflammations, asthma, chronic bronchitis, piles, diseases of the liver and spleen, urinary discharges, toothache, tuberculosis, scabies and epilepsy. This review provides a bird’s eye view about geographical distribution, folklore uses, phytoconstituents and pharmacological properties of P. roxburghii...|$|R

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uses a slightly different definition for biocides as [...] "a diverse group of poisonous substances including preservatives, <b>insecticides,</b> <b>disinfectants,</b> and pesticides used for the control of organisms that are harmful to human or animal health or that cause damage to natural or manufactured products". When compared, the two definitions roughly imply the same, although the US EPA definition includes plant protection products and some veterinary medicines.|$|R

40|$|Background: The aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} the “diagnosis changed ” rate in patients <b>notified</b> <b>as</b> tuberculosis (TB) on the Korean TB surveillance system (KTBS). Methods: A total of 1, 273 patients <b>notified</b> <b>as</b> TB cases on the KTBS in one private tertiary hospital in 2011 {{were enrolled in the}} present study. Patients were classified into three groups: “diagnosis maintained”, “diagnosis changed ” (initially <b>notified</b> <b>as</b> TB, but ultimately diagnosed as non-TB), and “administrative error ” (<b>notified</b> <b>as</b> TB due to administrative errors). Results: Excluding 17 patients in the “administrative error ” group, the “diagnosis maintained ” and “diagnosis changed” groups included 1, 097 (87. 3 %) and 159 patients (12. 7 %), respectively. Common causes of “diagnosis changed ” were nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) disease (51. 7 %, 61 / 118), and pneumonia (17. 8 %) in cases <b>notified</b> <b>as</b> pulmonary TB, and meningitis (19. 5 %, 8 / 41) and Crohn’s disease (12. 2 %) in cases <b>notified</b> <b>as</b> extrapulmonary TB. Being older than 35 years of age (odds ratio [OR], 2. 18) and a positive acid-fast bacilli stain (OR, 1. 58) were positive predictors and a TB-related radiological finding (OR, 0. 42) was a negative predictor for a “diagnosis changed ” result via multivariate logistic regression analysis in pulmonary TB cases. Conclusion: Because of a high “diagnosis changed ” rate in TB notifications to the KTBS, the TB incidence rate measured by the KTBS may be overestimated. Considering the worldwide trend toward increased NTM disease, the “diagnosis changed ” rate may increase over time. Thus, when reporting the annual TB notification rate in Korea, the exclusion o...|$|R
