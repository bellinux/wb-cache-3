5|$|As Wing Commander Kellett {{was taking}} off, Schumacher was dismissing {{any idea that}} the British would attempt a bombing raid in clear weather. On the island of Wangerooge, Leutnant Hermann Diehl of Regiment 3, battery LN-Vers was demonstrating the Freya set to a visiting naval officer. Diehl was using Falck's 2./ZG 76 to test the set. After some demonstration, he swung the set north, {{pointing}} to the Heliogoland Bight. As soon {{as he did so}} he picked up an echo. He telephoned Schumacher's Geschwader at Jever. They were told that the naval radar reported nothing, and that it was ridiculous to think the British would attack in such clear skies. Diehl spoke to von Bülow-Bothkamp. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know. Some 20 minutes later, naval Freyas also picked up the formation, but still no fighters were scrambled. German radar was just as efficient as its British counterpart, the problem lay in communication. The British married their radar to an efficient fighter control system. The Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine had poor communication and their areas of responsibility overlapped, creating confusion over who was responsible. Added to this was the German disbelief that RAF Bomber Command would expose itself on a day when conditions favoured the fighter. Only when observers on the ground confirmed that the formation existed were fighters scrambled. The observers described a formation of 44 British aircraft, twice its actual strength.|$|E
5|$|The CoE mistakenly {{believed}} that the waters of Beaver Lake would cover {{the area of the}} large hotels, so those parcels were added to the land they purchased for the project. Dallas Barrack, who owned Oklahoma Row, felt that he had been treated poorly and had received much less than his property was worth. The CoE held a sealed-bid auction and J. G. Gladdens purchased what was left of Missouri and Oklahoma Rows. He planned to move the remnants of Oklahoma Row out of the path of the rising lake waters. In order to do this, it was first necessary to remove the log portion or shell of the hotel. The original windows and doors were dismantled for the move and later reinstalled. The fireplaces, as well as all of the major stonework were later torn down. Also sold at auction were two massive concrete chairs that had been {{at the base of the}} amphitheater. They were bought by Mr. and Mrs. Ulis Rose of Rogers and were used to decorate the lawns of their Town and Country restaurant and motel. The chairs are still located in Rogers; however, they now sit unceremoniously in Frisco Park without any plaque or marker indicating their significance. The concrete couch was left in place at the base of the amphitheater, because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> try to move it.|$|E
25|$|With a new name, {{exactly the}} same sound they had before and several new songs written, Creed began playing locally.

25|$|In Portugal, D. Pedro I of Brazil became King as D. Pedro IV (1826), but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> re-establish {{the union}} of Portugal and Brazil. Pedro abdicated the Portuguese throne in favor of his {{daughter}} Princess Maria da Glória, then seven years old. D. Pedro's brother D. Miguel was to act as Regent, and to marry Maria when she came of age. In 1828, Miguel instead proclaimed himself King of Portugal and repudiated the liberal constitution granted by D. João VI, trying to establish an absolute monarchy.|$|E
25|$|On 27 August 1803, Durutte {{received}} {{promotion to}} general of division {{in spite of}} Napoleon Bonaparte's dislike of officers from Moreau's army. He {{became a member of}} the Légion d'Honneur on 11 December 1803 and a commander of the Légion on 9 June 1804. His former relationship with Moreau, who was exiled from France, then caused trouble. When asked to put his signature on a document agreeing with Napoleon's appointment as emperor of France, Durutte remained true to his republican beliefs and refused to sign. When his officers also offered to join him in defiance, he dissuaded them so their careers would not be ruined. After this incident, apparently <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> have anything to do with him except Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout, who gave him command of the island of Elba. He remained in this isolated post for three years.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, {{when he was}} 13 years old, {{his mother}} was {{approached}} {{by one of the}} owners of the Brandon Mill and he started to play for the mill's baseball team. He was the youngest player on the team. He was paid $2.50 to play on Saturdays (equivalent to $ today). He was originally placed as a pitcher, but one day he accidentally broke another player's arm with a fastball. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> bat against him so the manager of the team placed him in the outfield. His hitting ability made him a celebrity around town. Around that time he was given a baseball bat which he named Black Betsy. He was compared to Champ Osteen, another player from the mills who made it to the Majors. He moved from mill team to mill team in search of better pay, playing semi-professional baseball by 1905.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, Richter {{talked with}} {{producers}} Frank Marshall and Neil Canton about filming {{one of his}} screenplays. Out of this meeting, Canton and Richter formed their own production company and decided that Buckaroo Banzai {{would be the first}} film. Under their supervision, Mac Rauch wrote a 60-page treatment entitled, Lepers from Saturn. They shopped Mac Rauch's treatment around to production executives who were their peers but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> take on such unusual subject matter by two first-time producers and a first-time director. Canton and Richter contacted veteran producer Sidney Beckerman at MGM/United Artists, with whom Canton had worked before. Beckerman liked it and introduced Richter and Canton to studio chief David Begelman. Within 24 hours they had a development deal with the studio. It took Mac Rauch {{a year and a half}} to write the final screenplay and during this time, the Lepers from the treatment became Lizards and then Lectroids from Planet 10. Much of the film's detailed character histories were taken from Mac Rauch's unfinished Banzai scripts.|$|E
25|$|From {{the night}} of the event, Alexander I was {{suffering}} from high fever: his wound had become infected and soon developed into septicaemia. With the rapid evolution of his illness, doctors planned to amputate his leg but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> take responsibility for such an act. Operated seven times, he was cared for only by Aspasia during the four weeks which lasted his agony. Under the effect of the blood poisoning, the young King suffered terribly and his cries of pain were heard in the entire Royal Palace. On 19 October he became delirious and called out for his mother. However, the Greek government refused to allow Queen Sophia to re-enter the country. In St. Moritz, where she was exiled {{with the rest of the}} royal family, the Queen begged the Hellenic authorities to let her take care of her son but Venizelos remained adamant. Finally, Dowager Queen Olga, widow of George I, was allowed to travel alone to Athens to be with her grandson. But delayed by rough seas, she arrived two hours after the King's death, on 25 October 1920. Informed by telegram that night, other members of the royal family learned of the death with sadness.|$|E

[...] He recalls his experience as music editor for The Guardian, where he has [...] "been commissioning those pieces, knowing they will be read ... if <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> read about Taylor Swift, you would never see another thinkpiece about her.

It was, however, the band's first album to chart on the UK Albums Chart, debuting at number 45. Many of the songs on Leave Home were not {{considered}} by Mickey Leigh to be [...] "radio–friendly" [...] because [...] "Carbona Not Glue" [...] was about Intoxicative inhalant. Joey relates: [...] "We thought we had a lotta songs that should've been hits. If you grew up in the sixties, things would just get played and be hits right off the bat.

500|$|Carpenter {{had just}} made Dark Star but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hire him as a director, so he assumed {{that he would make}} it in Hollywood as a screenwriter. The filmmaker went on to do other films with the {{intention}} of making Escape later. After the success of Halloween, Avco-Embassy signed him and producer Debra Hill to a two-picture deal. The first film from this contract was The Fog. Initially, the second film {{that he was going to}} make to finish the contract was The Philadelphia Experiment, but because of script-writing problems, Carpenter rejected it in favor of this project. However, Carpenter felt that something was missing and recalls, [...] "This was basically a straight action film. And at one point, I realized it really doesn't have this kind of crazy humor that people from New York would expect to see." [...] He brought in Nick Castle, a friend from his film school days at University of Southern California who played [...] "The Shape" [...] in Halloween. Castle invented the Cabbie character and came up with the film's ending.|$|E
500|$|The {{culmination}} of the plot saw Lydia stab Zoe. The storyline {{was described as a}} [...] "brutal attack" [...] and at the time producers refused to reveal if Zoe would survive. Describing the terror Lydia causes for Zoe, a spokesperson for the serial stated: [...] "Zoe can’t believe it when Lydia admits the parachute was meant for her. As soon as she realises Lydia wanted her dead she tries to run. That’s when Lydia pulls out a knife and stabs her." [...] This led to a fight between Lydia and Charlotte who arrives with Dave Colburn (Elliot James Langridge). They both fight to grab the knife while an unconscious Zoe bleeds, ultimately leading to the arrest of Lydia when the police arrive. She is later charged with the murder of Sarah and the attempted murder of Zoe. Several weeks after the character was stabbed, she was seen feeling as if <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be in her company. After three of her longtime friends snubbed her ideas to make a fresh start elsewhere, ultimately she was she went travelling with her former boyfriend Mike Barnes (Tony Hirst) and Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan).|$|E

500|$|Larrys {{sales were}} very poor at first, with only 4,000 copies sold upon its release. Some resellers refused {{to handle the}} game, while others refused to {{advertise}} it, and one refused to list the game on its list of best sellers. A Sierra employee quit and a potential employee refused to work on Larry. Lowe stated, [...] "My initial reaction was that I had wasted six months of my life." [...] Word-of-mouth spread quickly, however, and by the year's end, the game became a commercial success, selling over 250,000 copies. It sold over 300,000 units in total. According to Sierra's marketing director John Williams, [...] "Obviously lots of retailers were selling lots of Leisure Suit Larry, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> admit it". It also became widely pirated, including in the Soviet Union. According to Lowe, a film adaptation was considered and he was flown to Hollywood to demonstrate the game in person. Footage from the game {{was used in the}} 1990 music video for Sailor's song [...] "The Secretary". Sierra received what Williams described as a [...] "deluge" [...] of mail opposing its release of Larry after he wrote a series of articles for Computer Gaming World discussing his company and the industry's views on adult software. However, a significant number of the game's players were women. Leisure Suit Larrys success resulted {{in a long line of}} sequels and spin-off titles.|$|E
