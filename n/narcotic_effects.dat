25|$|Helium {{is usually}} mixed with oxygen and air {{to produce a}} range of {{effectively}} three component gas blends known as Trimixes.

25|$|For dives {{requiring}} long decompression stops, divers {{may carry}} cylinders containing different gas mixtures {{for the various}} phases of the dive, typically designated as Travel, Bottom, and Decompression gases.

50|$|Equivalent {{narcotic}} depth (END) is used {{in technical}} diving {{as a way of}} estimating the <b>narcotic</b> <b>effect</b> of a breathing gas mixture, such as heliox and trimix. The method is, for a given mix and depth, to calculate the depth which would produce the same <b>narcotic</b> <b>effect</b> when breathing air.|$|R
25|$|Drugs bearing {{resemblance}} to codeine in effects due to close structural relationship are {{variations on the}} methyl groups at the 3 position including ethylmorphine a.k.a. codethyline (Dionine) and benzylmorphine (Peronine). While having no <b>narcotic</b> <b>effects</b> of its own, the important opioid precursor thebaine differs from codeine only slightly in structure. Pseudocodeine and some other similar alkaloids not currently used in medicine are found in trace amounts in opium as well.|$|E
25|$|Helium is an {{inert gas}} {{which is used}} in {{breathing}} mixtures for diving to reduce or eliminate the <b>narcotic</b> <b>effects</b> of other gases at depth. It is a relatively expensive gas and has some undesirable side effects, {{and as a result}} is used where it significantly improves safety. Another desirable feature of helium is low density and low viscosity compared to nitrogen. These properties reduce work of breathing, which can become a limiting factor to the diver at extreme depths.|$|E
25|$|The structure-activity {{relationship}} of morphine {{has been extensively}} studied. As {{a result of the}} extensive study and use of this molecule, more than 250 morphine derivatives (also counting codeine and related drugs) have been developed since {{the last quarter of the}} 19th century. These drugs range from 25% the analgesic strength of codeine (or slightly more than 2% of the strength of morphine) to several thousand times the strength of morphine, to powerful opioid antagonists, including naloxone (Narcan), naltrexone (Trexan), diprenorphine (M5050, the reversing agent for the Immobilon dart) and nalorphine (Nalline). Some opioid agonist-antagonists, partial agonists, and inverse agonists are also derived from morphine. The receptor-activation profile of the semi-synthetic morphine derivatives varies widely and some, like apomorphine are devoid of <b>narcotic</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Breathing air {{deeper than}} [...] (pressure > 4 bar) has a {{significant}} <b>narcotic</b> <b>effect</b> on the diver. As helium has no <b>narcotic</b> <b>effect,</b> this can be avoided by adding helium to the mixture so that the partial pressure of narcotic gases remains below a debilitating level. This varies depending on the diver, and there is significant cost in helium mixtures, but the increased safety and efficiency of work resulting from helium use can be worth the cost.|$|R
5|$|Equivalent {{narcotic}} depth (END) is {{a commonly}} used {{way of expressing}} the <b>narcotic</b> <b>effect</b> of different breathing gases. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Diving Manual now states that oxygen and nitrogen should be considered equally narcotic. Standard tables, based on relative lipid solubilities, list conversion factors for <b>narcotic</b> <b>effect</b> of other gases. For example, hydrogen at a given pressure has a <b>narcotic</b> <b>effect</b> equivalent to nitrogen at 0.55 times that pressure, so in principle it should be usable at {{more than twice the}} depth. Argon, however, has 2.33 times the <b>narcotic</b> <b>effect</b> of nitrogen, and is a poor choice as a breathing gas for diving (it is used as a drysuit inflation gas, owing to its low thermal conductivity). Some gases have other dangerous effects when breathed at pressure; for example, high-pressure oxygen can lead to oxygen toxicity. Although helium is the least intoxicating of the breathing gases, at greater depths it can cause high pressure nervous syndrome, a still mysterious but apparently unrelated phenomenon. Inert gas narcosis is only one factor influencing the choice of gas mixture; the risks of decompression sickness and oxygen toxicity, cost, and other factors are also important.|$|R

25|$|The {{composition}} of the breathing gas during pressure exposure and decompression is significant in inert gas uptake and elimination for a given pressure exposure profile. Breathing gas mixtures for diving will typically have a different gas fraction of nitrogen to that of air. The partial pressure of each component gas will differ to that of nitrogen in air at any given depth, and uptake and elimination of each inert gas component {{is proportional to the}} actual partial pressure over time. The two foremost reasons for use of mixed breathing gases are the reduction of nitrogen partial pressure by dilution with oxygen, to make Nitrox mixtures, primarily to reduce the rate of nitrogen uptake during pressure exposure, and the substitution of helium (and occasionally other gases) for the nitrogen to reduce the <b>narcotic</b> <b>effects</b> under high partial pressure exposure. Depending on the proportions of helium and nitrogen, these gases are called Heliox if there is no nitrogen, or Trimix if there is nitrogen and helium along with the essential oxygen.|$|E

The inert gases used as substitutes for nitrogen have different solubility and diffusion characteristics in living tissues to the nitrogen they replace. For example, the most common inert gas diluent substitute for nitrogen is helium, which is significantly less soluble in living tissue, but also diffuses faster due to the relatively small size and mass of the He atom in comparison with the N2 molecule.|$|E
2500|$|This {{may be due}} to a {{dissociation}} of {{the subjective}} and behavioural effects of narcosis.
