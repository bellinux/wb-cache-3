This paper investigates the determinants of non-agricultural employment as well as <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>income</b> and then assesses the contribution of these determinants to income inequality with the Chinese Academy of Social Science 2003 survey data and a three-step decomposition approach. Our results indicate that education inequality accounts for 9 % and 36 % wage and self-employment income inequality respectively which implies that education inequality plays substantial roles in <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>income</b> inequalities. The community characteristics collectively accounts for 46 % and 32 % of the wage and self-employment income inequality respectively which in turn suggests that regional development is of great importance in the determination of <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>income</b> inequality. non-agricultural income; employment; inequality...|$|E

We examine {{the effect of}} connecting a household to the grid and the quality of electricity, defined as hours of daily supply. The analysis is based on two rounds of a representative panel of more than 10, 000 households. We use the district-level density of transmission cables as instrument for the electrification status of the household. We find that a grid connection increases <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>incomes</b> of rural households by about 9 percent during the study period (1994 - 2005).

40|$|Income {{inequality}} {{has been}} rising in parallel with the economic liberalisation process in the former centrally planned economies. The opportunities for <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>income</b> associated with the market liberalisation process in former centrally planned economies {{would seem to be}} important in determining inequality within the rural sector. This article reviews the trends in inequality in Viet Nam examining differential trends and hypothesised causes. Inequality is important because of its relationship to other factors {{in the evolution of the}} agricultural economy such as the incidence of poverty and the sustainability of emerging income sources. This article analyses income inequality based on data collected by the author in two Districts in coastal northern Viet Nam. The results demonstrate that <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>income</b> sources, specifically aquaculture and wage and remittance, contribute more to present inequality than any other income source. Simulation shows that the emergence of aquaculture since the late 1980 s has been driving the inequality increase in that period. Hence the analysis provides evidence that <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>income</b> increases inequality even without asset concentration. This concentration of income is important in the north Viet Nam context since it is concurrent with present-day land allocation and will affect the structure of future income growth. ...|$|E

40|$|Incomes of {{agricultural}} population encompass as well incomes from farm running, as <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>incomes</b> (mainly from work beyond the farm). In a farm the produced income consists of payment of own work and of net income (i. e. rent and interest). Sources of income creation and distribution {{are inherent in}} production resources possessed by a farm. A farm income is then created {{as a result of}} work by a family farm, while its effectiveness is different owing to a farm type (and its structure). It is reflected in payment of own work and in distinction of net income, that can occur only potentially sometimes. The produced agricultural income is divided for a consumed part (equal to payment of own work) and accumulated part (equal to net income). Consumption is increased by <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>incomes</b> and finally it appears as natural, goods and social consumption (such division is conditioned by the way of satisfaction of the country's population needs). Accumulation is destined for net investments and increase in resources of acting capital, what occurs in some farms potentially only.

Consumption and production functions are the most important ones. They determine development of farm output and interests of farm population in its growth.

It {{has been found that}} inequalities in terms of share of total income and population exist both in case of agricultural and <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>income</b> irrespective of sub-groups. The contribution of agricultural income in the income profile is less than that of <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>income</b> which exhibits the deplorable condition of agriculture and thereby the non-agricultural sector has an immense scope for reduction of income inequality even the fact remains that about 65 per cent of the rural population engages in agriculture. The study observed that so far as food security is concerned, though India achieved self-sufficiency in food grain production since 1970 s, the achievement did not percolate down to masses. These deprivations are very acute with differentiated degrees of severity in almost all sub-groups except medium farms. Inequality in income is much higher than that of food insecurity in all sub-groups which is in conformity with Engel’s Law.

This system in general accounting and contributions by the upper class households in special accounting were effective in demonstrating the prestige of each household.

This paper analyses whether the goals of increasing productivity and changing the production structure where achieved. There are three basic outcomes from the reforms: small scale farmers have los market shares and depend on <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>incomes.</b> Secondly, the trading of land is marginal, as export goods are produced on a small share of productive land and the agricultural corporations have many alternative to the purchase Hof land.

Panel data covering rural households in four districts in Pakistan suggest that real incomes of many households declined between the early 1990 s and 2002, in spite of modest gains in agricultural output at the provincial and national levels. Net crop income increased by 38 percent for the total sample and by 81 percent growth for poor farmers, whose total incomes rose by 23 percent. Nevertheless, rural <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>incomes</b> fell by 30 percent overall and by 16 percent for poor households, indicating that the income and employment multipliers of agricultural growth were insufficient to lead to substantial gains in rural non-farm incomes. A decline in remittances was also a major factor in reducing real incomes in three of the four districts. Controlling for other factors, electrification of the village and paved roads raise household real expenditures by about 75 and 100 percent, respectively, suggesting that accelerated public investments in village electrification could {{have a significant impact on}} rural poverty.

40|$|This {{report is}} based on {{information}} collected from a face-to-face {{survey of more than}} 1 000 farmers from three regions of Albania (namely Berat, Elbasan and Lezhë To identify a representative sample of Albanian farming systems, a three-step sample design was used. A group of 11 variables dealing with the socio-economic characteristics of farms was selected to build up the farming system typology. Two typologies are used: one for the whole sample (three regions) and a second one for each region. The differences between the two typologies are considered to be a proxy indicator of different characteristics of farming systems in each region. The farm types identified are (1) poly-culture, mainly for the market; (2) leisure farms; (3) arable crops; (4) fruit trees; (5) self-sufficient; and (6) livestock. The farm typology is slightly different for the regions of Berat and Lezhë. The farm types’ strategies are constructed according to the land, infrastructure facilities and the investment availability of farms. <b>Non-agricultural</b> <b>incomes</b> (remittances, income from the construction, trade, pensions, etc.) appear to provide an important economic support for the farm household. Farming structures in rural areas are characterised by the use of more labour and lower inputs. The farm types that tend to specialise in one activity are not always those that make the best use of labour and land. Farming does not provide enough income to repay the work put in at the official minimum wage level. Non-agricultural work is better paid. Albanian farms provide at least a minimal income that is enough to keep the household members above the threshold of extreme poverty. The farm types that base their incomes on agricultural activities are poorer than those that base their <b>income</b> on <b>non-agricultural</b> activities. <b>Income</b> structures and the low incomes generated by work in agriculture suggests that rural migration towards urban areas and abroad is a phenomenon that will persist into the future.

40|$|Available data on {{per head}} incomes in {{agriculture}} {{to those in}} the rest of economy show that in almost all countries, with very few exceptions, per head incomes in agriculture are lower than those on other occupations. Since such disparity exists in the USA too, the subject of the study is the analysis of the relation between agricultural and <b>non-agricultural</b> <b>incomes</b> and of the causes of income disparity. The analysis leads {{to the conclusion that the}} narrowing of the gap between the incomes per head of farm and non-farm population is due to the growing off-farm incomes received by the farm population. The disparity between incomes from farming and from non-farm sources has not yet disappeared. The main cause of income disparity is not the difference in productivity in agriculture and in the rest of the economy, but the unfavourable tendencies in the level of prices received and paid by the farmers. Since one of the principal aims of the American agricultural policy is the rise of agricultural incomes level and the narrowing of the disparity between incomes received from farming and from other occupations, it can by said, that in this respect the American agricultural policy appears ineffective.

Approximately 3. 5 % of Mpumalanga value added gross domestic product comes through agriculture and 2. 3 % {{of the population in}} Mpumalanga is working in this sector. There is thus a need for macro-economic research in order to investigate potential and current challenges and opportunities. This paper examines several of these challenges namely demographic compositions, unemployment, income distribution, poverty and inequality. It will provide results from the Labour Force Surveys from 2000 until 2007 with a more in-depth look into 2007. Population and labour force statistics provide the foundation for further analysis. This paper indicates that unemployment is being dominated by the African individuals and that employment in Mpumalanga {{agricultural sector}} is on a decreasing trend.
