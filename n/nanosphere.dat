Mitoxantrone- (MTO-) loaded PLGA <b>nanospheres</b> were prepared by a solvent evaporation technique. The PLGA <b>nanospheres</b> surface was modified with CS by two strategies (adsorption and covalent binding). PLGA <b>nanospheres</b> of 248. 4 +/- 21. 0 nm in diameter characterized by the laser light scattering technique, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are spherical and its drug encapsulation efficiency is 84. 1 +/- 3. 4 %.

In vitro drug release demonstrated that CS-modified <b>nanospheres</b> have many advantages such as prolonged drug release property and decreased the burst release over the unmodified <b>nanospheres,</b> and the modified <b>nanospheres</b> by covalent binding method could achieve the release kinetics of a relatively constant release.

The carrier capacity of sodium alginate was evaluated in terms of drug to polymer ratio. In vitro release study was carried out on all drug loaded <b>nanospheres</b> by the dialysis method. Release kinetics of drug from different drug loaded <b>nanospheres</b> was also determined. The in vivo antifungal efficacy of <b>nanospheres</b> bound drug vis-à-vis the free drug was evaluated in candidiasis- induced mice models. Results: Preparation of <b>nanospheres</b> through controlled gellification method yielded particles with a size range of 419. 6 ± 0. 28 nm. Studies on drug to polymer ratio showed a linear relationship between concentration of drug and drug loading capacity. In vitro release kinetic study revealed that the release of drug from the <b>nanospheres</b> followed Fickian diffusion. In vivo studies showed that the nanosphere-bound drug produced a higher antifungal efficacy than the free drug...|$|R
40|$|Gene {{delivery}} holds therapeutic {{promise for}} the treatment of neurological diseases and spinal cord injury. Although several studies have investigated the use of non-viral vectors, such as polyethylenimine (PEI), their clinical value is limited by their cytotoxicity. Recently, biodegradable poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) <b>nanospheres</b> have been explored as non-viral vectors. Here, we show that modification of PLGA <b>nanospheres</b> with 3 β-[N-(N',N'-dimethylaminoethane) carbamoyl] cholesterol (DC-Chol) enhances gene transfection efficiency. PLGA/DC-Chol <b>nanospheres</b> encapsulating DNA were prepared using a double emulsion-solvent evaporation method. PLGA/DC-Chol <b>nanospheres</b> were less cytotoxic than PEI both in vitro and in vivo. DC-Chol modification improved the uptake of <b>nanospheres,</b> thereby increasing their transfection efficiency in mouse neural stem cells in vitro and rat spinal cord in vivo. Also, transgene expression induced by PLGA <b>nanospheres</b> was higher and longer-lasting than that induced by PEI. In a rat model of spinal cord injury, PLGA/DC-Chol <b>nanospheres</b> loaded with vascular endothelial growth factor gene increased angiogenesis at the injury site, improved tissue regeneration, and resulted in better recovery of locomotor function. These results suggest that DC-Chol-modified PLGA <b>nanospheres</b> could serve as therapeutic gene delivery vehicles for spinal cord injury...|$|R
