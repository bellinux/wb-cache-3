40|$|Human ribosomal gene repeats are {{distributed}} among five nucleolar organizer regions (<b>NORs)</b> on the p arms of acrocentric chromosomes. On exit from mitosis, nucleoli form around individual active <b>NORs.</b> As cells {{progress through the}} cycle, these mini-nucleoli fuse to form large nucleoli incorporating multiple <b>NORs.</b> It is generally assumed that nucleolar incorporation of individual <b>NORs</b> is dependent on ribosomal gene transcription. To test this assumption, we determined the nuclear location of individual human acrocentric chromosomes, and their associated <b>NORs,</b> in mouse> human cell hybrids. Human ribosomal genes are transcriptionally silent in this context. Combined immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization (immuno-FISH) on three-dimensional preserved nuclei showed that human acrocentric chromosomes associate with hybrid cell nucleoli. Analysis of purified nucleoli demonstrated that human and mouse <b>NORs</b> are equally likely to be within a hybrid cell nucleolus. This is supported further by the observation that murine upstream binding factor can associate with human <b>NORs.</b> Incorporation of silent <b>NORs</b> into mature nucleoli raises interesting issues concerning {{the maintenance of the}} activity status of individual <b>NORs...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{human cells}} ribosomal genes are {{organized}} as clusters called Nucleolus Organizer Regions (<b>NORs)</b> that are {{situated on the}} short arms of acrocentric chromosomes. It was found that essential components of the RNA polymerase I transcription machinery, including Upstream Binding Factor (UBF), can be detected on some <b>NORs,</b> termed "competent" <b>NORs,</b> during mitosis.

But since individual <b>NORs</b> cannot be observed in the cell nucleus, their interphase status remained unclear. To address this problem, we detected the competent <b>NORs</b> by two commonly used methods, UBF immunofluorescence and silver staining, and combined them with FISH for visualization of rDNA and/or specific chromosomes. We found that the numbers of competent <b>NORs</b> on specific chromosomes were largely conserved in the subsequent cell cycles, with certain NOR-bearing homologues displaying a very stable pattern of competence. Importantly, those and only those <b>NORs,</b> which were loaded with UBF, incorporated bromo-uridine in metaphase after stimulation with roscovitine and in telophase, suggesting that competent and only competent <b>NORs</b> contain ribosomal genes transcriptionally active during interphase.

40|$|Recently, {{a simple}} {{technique}} for selective staining mammalian chromosomal nucleolar organizing regions with silver solution, designated Ag- I, {{has been reported}} (Bloom and Goodpasture, 1976). To visualize the nucleolar organizing regions (<b>NORs)</b> in plant chromosomes, we applied the Ag- I technique to various species of plants, and found that in all species examined, the silver preferentially stains the known locations of <b>NORs</b> at secondary constrictions or at telomeres. With the Ag- I technique, silver-stained <b>NORs</b> were visualized as dark brown-black bodies on yellow-brown chromosome arms. In some species studied, locations of the silver-stained <b>NORs</b> were in accord with chromosomal ones of 18 S + 25 S ribosomal RNA genes demonstrated by in situ DNA/RNA hybridization. These data indicate the silver staining is specific for <b>NORs</b> (ribosomal RNA gene site) in plant genome, too. Treatment with TCA, HCl, and acetic acid did not visibly affect the silver stainability of <b>NORs.</b> This suggests that the silver stains NOR-specific proteins which are essentially acidic in nature. After treatment with cold temperature, relative frequencies of the silver-stained <b>NORs</b> among chromosomes of a complement varied in a given species in whose complement all chromosomes have telomeric <b>NORs</b> {{different from each other}} as to the nucleolar-forming activities. This finding seems to support the hypothesis that the presence of the silver-stained proteins at <b>NORs</b> is associated with ribosomal gene activity. 近年, 哺乳動物染色体の核小体(仁) 形成部(NORs) を差別的に濃染する簡便な方法(Ag-I法) が開発された(Bloom and Goodpasture, 1976) 。この方法が植物染色体のNORsをも差別的に濃染するか否かを確かめるために, Ag- 1 法を種々の植物種に適用した。その結果, 調べたすべての植物種で染色体NORsは銀で濃染されることがわかった。銀染されたNORsは黄色または褐色に染まった染色体腕上に黒褐色あるいは黒色の濃染部としてみられた。数種の植物では, 濃染されたNORsの位置はin situ DNA/RNA雑種分子形成法により示された 18 S+ 25 S ribosomal RNA genesの染色体上の部位と一致した。これらの結果は植物のゲノムにおいても銀染色法はNORs(ribosomal RNA gene sites) を差別的に濃染することを示している。TCA, HClおよび酢酸処理を行なっても, NORsの銀染色性は変らなかった。このことは銀が酸性のNOR-特有タンパク質を染色していることを示唆している。染色体組の全染色体が末端部にNORsをもつがその活性能力にちがいのある植物種を低温下におくと, 銀濃染されたNORsをもつ染色体の出現頻度が染色体組の染色体間で変った。この知見はNORsでの銀濃染タンパク質の存在がその部位に存るribosomal RNA genesの活性と関連しているという仮説を支持しているとおもわれる...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that chromosomes occupy {{more or less}} fixed positions in mammalian interphase nucleus. However, relation between large-scale order of chromosome positioning and gene activity remains unclear. We used {{the model of the}} human ribosomal genes to address specific aspects of this problem. Ribosomal genes are organized at particular chromosomal sites in clusters termed nucleolus organizer regions (<b>NORs).</b> Only some <b>NORs,</b> called competent are generally accepted to be transcriptionally active during interphase. Importantly in this respect, the regularities in distribution of competent, and non-competent <b>NORs</b> among the specific chromosomes were already established in two human-derived cell lines: transformed HeLa and primary LEP cells. In the present study, using FISH and immunocytochemistry, we found that in HeLa and LEP cells the large-scale positioning of the NOR-bearing chromosomes with regard to nucleoli is linked to the transcription activity of rDNA. Namely, the tendency of rDNA-bearing chromosomes to associate with nucleoli correlates with the number of transcriptionally competent <b>NORs</b> in the respective chromosome homologs. Regarding the position of <b>NORs,</b> we found that not only competent but also most of the non-competent <b>NORs</b> are included in the nucleoli.

40|$|The omnipresence of Naturally Occurring Radionuclides (<b>NORs)</b> {{within the}} Earth is well-known. Since long, {{radioactive}} decay of <b>NORs</b> has been recognised {{as the primary}} source of our internal planetary heat, and driving force of volcanism and the movement of plates forming the Earth's crust. Since <b>NORs</b> are most abundant in the Earth's crust, from which all oil and gas are produced, it is no surprise to encounter <b>NORs</b> in the oil and gas industry. Already {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th Century, it became clear that <b>NORs</b> can be produced together with hydrocarbons. In oil and gas production facilities, enhanced quantities of some <b>NORs</b> can be found in the hydrocarbons themselves, in coproduced water, and in all kinds of waste materials such as mineral scales and sludges. Production water and deposits containing <b>NORs</b> have been termed NORM, i. e. Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials, or TENORM, i. e. Technologically Enhanced NORM. The presence of NORM in production facilities can face oil and gas companies with large additional costs in maintenance, treatment and lost production, while extra care has to be taken regarding the environment and the health of production personnel. Therefore, management of NORM is essential to the oil and gas industry. Knowledge on the occurrence, origin and formation of NORM forms the basis of NORM management. Understanding NORM might assist in prediction or even prevention of NORM build-up in production facilities, leading to important risk and costs reductions. This study was initialised to gain insight into the chemical behaviour and physical properties of primordial <b>NORs</b> U and Th and their decay products in hydrocarbon reservoirs and production facilities during production, processing and treatment of oil and gas.
