It was {{presented}} at ITS-NY 2008 : [URL] market for the <b>Nomadic</b> <b>Devices,</b> such as on-board navigation devices and smart phones, integrated to road vehicles is increasing rapidly today. While providing uselful services for travellers, at the same time, these devices may introduce significant usability and distraction problems, jeopardizing their safety as the devices are not usually specially designed for the vehicle context. Consequently, {{there is a need}} to study the impacts of such devices by Field Operational Tests (FOT). TeleFOT (Field Operational Tests of Aftermarket and <b>Nomadic</b> <b>Devices</b> in Vehicles), is a European Commission co-funded integrated project aiming to assess the impacts of aftermarket and <b>nomadic</b> <b>devices</b> used in vehicles for driver support and to raise wide awareness of the functions and potential these devices offer, by implementing Field Operational Tests.

The objective {{of this paper is}} to present the analysis plan for efficiency assessment, by measuring a set of parameter indicators which characterise traffic efficiency (speed, travel times, traffic composition, etc.), and thus make an estimation of the level of traffic efficiency on the network and whether this is influenced by the use of aftermarket and <b>nomadic</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|E
40|$|Introduction of {{wireless}} vehicular communication allows for cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure, thus enabling {{a variety of}} new ITS use cases. Furthermore, modern vehicles feature an increasing number of driving automation functions. In this paper a complex test scenario including automated driving, environment perception, communication with the infrastructure (Vehicle to Infrastructure, V 2 I) and with <b>nomadic</b> <b>devices</b> is described. Based on this, the requirements for a cooperative and automated ITS are identified. In order to demonstrate the test scenario, an integrated ITS design is proposed assembling Vehicle Technology and Communication Technologies with the Traffic Infrastructure and <b>Nomadic</b> <b>Devices.</b> This has been implemented in a prototype for evaluation in February 2011...|$|E
50|$|The Automotive {{competence}} area covers {{applied research}} with industry actors targeting IT applications {{and services that}} are based, or partly based, on in-vehicle computing and communication platforms. Examples of application areas include active safety, diagnostics or remote diagnostics, and <b>nomadic</b> <b>device</b> integration.|$|R
30|$|An {{example of}} such an {{advisory}} system is Connected Cruise Control (CCC; see for example [7, 8]). CCC offers drivers advice on the optimal speed, headway and driving lane in order to optimize the distribution of cars on the motorway and counteract the build-up and propagation of shockwaves. Drivers will receive individual advice messages via an in-car, <b>nomadic</b> <b>device.</b> These individual messages are adjusted to a drivers current lane, headway and speed, the actual speed limit {{as well as the}} desired route.|$|R

40|$|Please see {{report for}} a full list of authors. This report is also {{available}} at [URL] the basis of systems & functions identified in WP 5 <b>nomadic</b> <b>devices,</b> the Nomadic Device team in FESTA has focused its efforts to find a generic method to answer these following questions: • What are the relevant <b>nomadic</b> <b>devices</b> services to be tested in an FOT? • What are the relevant use cases lists that correspond to mature systems? • How to identify & prepare the research & questions towards <b>nomadic</b> <b>devices?</b> • How to link hypotheses to indicators and concrete measurements during the FOT? In the annex, the reader will find a list answering partially these questions but most important the process was used to setup a methodology for {{the selection of the}} systems and functions and the identification of the research questions for future FOTs addressing <b>Nomadic</b> <b>Devices.</b> Therefore, this document provides a procedure on how to build a list of functions and hypotheses taking into account issues with a holistic point of view on safety, mobility, environment, business and implementation rather than providing an exhaustive list of functions or hypotheses which would need to be tested in an FOT. The main chapter of this document describes 5 steps to go from the definition of the relevant functions and systems to the hypotheses to be tested during an FOT. Eventually, the hypotheses will lead to a list of indicators and measures which will help the study design of your FOT. The five steps are: • Step 1 : Selection and description of Functions • Step 2 : Definition of use cases and situations • Step 3 : Identification of the Research Questions • Step 4 : Creation of Hypotheses • Step 5 : Link Hypotheses with indicators for quantitative analyses Building the right list of functions and their hypotheses will be the basis of a good FOT. Understanding the political, societal and technical benefit of the FOT as a whole before it has even started is a key to its successful outcome. It is therefore strongly advised to put considerable effort and time on this preliminary work which might seems more paper-like before starting the exciting implementation of the devices and functions for large-scale testing...|$|E

40|$|People {{feel very}} {{comfortable}} when they interact with their mobile devices by using natural user interfaces (NUIs). However, when they enter a vehicle, this feeling degrades rapidly, since many in-vehicle infotainment systems (IVIs) still do not offer natural user interfaces and use different user interface interaction paradigms. For this reason, we show how mobile devices can be integrated and used in the automotive domain. We first elaborate on architectural concerns and then summarize possible benefits of a mobile device integration. A basic set of interaction scenarios is presented {{in order to show}} how integrated mobile devices can contribute to NUI experience in vehicles. Finally, two available approaches are introduced and their potential for NUI integration is initially evaluated.

40|$|AbstractThe TeleFOT project {{investigates the}} impacts of {{functions}} brought to the driver by <b>nomadic</b> and aftermarket <b>devices</b> and the methodology chosen is Field Operational Tests (FOTs). The FESTA Handbook {{was used as the}} first approach for the implementation, execution and evaluation of the FOTs. The functions tested were Traffic information, Speed Limit Information, Speed Alert, Navigation Support (static), Navigation Support (dynamic), Green Driving Support, and eCall. The characteristics of these functions imply that they must be studied in a wider transportation context than just traffic and cover also transport and travel. Furthermore, the user must be studied in different roles as driver, passenger and traveller and the trip time line must be considered (i. e. trip planning and use during and after the trip). A consequence of that the platform used for the functions was not a vehicle but a <b>nomadic</b> <b>device</b> (to be used in a vehicle but also elsewhere) made it necessary to complement the FOT activities with controlled experiments. This resulted in a proposal for modification of the FESTA Handbook where also the well-known “FESTA V” was expanded to include a block “CONTEXT” to capture the wider use of the functions addressed (i. e. also outside the vehicle). Finally, a new and innovative top-down approach was added to improve the identification of research questions and hypotheses and in order to minimise the work at hand a prioritisation of the hypotheses using a cost-benefit approach was proposed and applied. These three proposed modifications have been accepted and are now found in the latest version 3 of the FESTA Handbook...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn recent years, {{there has}} been rapid and {{significant}} development of road transport technologies in order toreduce the number of killed and injured people on roads. These include safety technologies, emergency callsystems (eCall), and advanced traveler information systems. The eCall system is an automatic in-vehicleemergency call service, which is mainly used for notifying emergency services about dangerous road situationsand their exact location. In this paper, an eCall platform prototype is developed to allow quick andefficient rescue of injured people in dangerous road situations. The eCall function is developed and installedin <b>nomadic</b> <b>devices</b> (e. g., smartphones and tablets). Large-scale field operational tests were conducted in realsettings to assess the impacts of the eCall function provided by in-vehicle <b>nomadic</b> <b>devices.</b> More precisely,experiments were conducted by more than 250 participants with different sociodemographic profiles in orderto study the users’ acceptance {{of the use of}} the developed eCall function for large-scale usage.

40|$|Today, the {{automobile}} industry and several research institutes develop automated vehicles for several driving applications. With increasing capabilities of automation the driver can {{be more and more}} dispensed from the driving task and might want to use his <b>nomadic</b> <b>devices</b> to get entertained, read the news or do office work while driving. However, in some complex driving situations (like road works, freeway exit ramps or lane closure due to car accidents) the automation still needs to safely hand over the control to the driver. These situations require a lot of attention by the driver who must not be tempted to ignore the warnings of the assistance system and to continue any task on the nomadic device until a critical situation originates. This paper describes a method to link <b>nomadic</b> <b>devices</b> to vehicles to support a safe usage during highly automated driving and a first approach to ensure a safe transition between different automation modes. Therefore, the automation system is connected to the nomadic device in the vehicle and has the ability to actively control the content on the screen.

40|$|Many of the {{emerging}} software applications for <b>nomadic</b> <b>devices</b> are useful in the car as well. In order to use these applications safely in the car, {{it is necessary to}} couple them with the vehicle’s infotainment system and its user interface which is optimized for use by the driver. This paper describes a new approach to exchange services and user interfaces between cars and <b>nomadic</b> <b>devices.</b> Services are exchanged through dynamically generated Web Services. HTML 5 based user interface descriptions are used to access shared vehicle software interfaces as well as the remote application’s logic with the help of additional mechanisms for device communication. Make and model specific design is ensured by Stylesheets that are specific for the car model. Our solution combines in-vehicle infotainment systems with external applications in a safe and secure way. Especially, {{there is no need for}} pre-defined service specific interfaces, because all interfaces are exchanged dynamically. The paper starts with a motivation, an overview of related work and outstanding challenges followed by a presentation of our approach for in-vehicle device coupling. The user interface exchange is described in detail in the third paragraph. The paper finishes with an example scenario and a conclusion...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} extent to which driver comprehension of imminent crash warnings is affected by the degree of integration when there are multiple Connected Vehicle products in the vehicle. Two displays were placed in an experimental vehicle: one representing original equipment and one representing a portable, <b>nomadic</b> <b>device.</b> Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} five device integration conditions. Participants drove on a test track and were occasionally presented with either a non-urgent message or an urgent crash warning. Participants recognized warnings most quickly when only one display was active in the car; when both displays were active, response times generally improved when messages and warnings were integrated into a single physical location. Warning recognition times were longer when a warning closely followed a non-urgent message on the other display than when a warning followed a non-urgent message on the same display. When messages and warnings from both source displays were integrated into a single display, this effect was not observed, suggesting that the separate display locations are responsible for the increased warning recognition time rather than the different formats of the messages from each source device...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMobility 2. 0 is an ITS project {{aiming at}} {{developing}} and testing an in-vehicle commuting assistant for FEV mobility, resulting in more reliable and energy-efficient electro-mobility. In {{order to achieve}} a maximum impact, Mobility 2. 0 takes an integrated approach of addressing the main bottlenecks of urban FEV mobility: 'range anxiety' related to the limited FEV range, scarcity of parking spaces with public recharging spots and the congestion of urban roads. Our integrated approach means that the application developed by Mobility 2. 0 will utilize co-operative systems, through communication with transport/traffic city control systems and interaction with the charging infrastructure, to simultaneously consider these bottlenecks, so that such an optimization can be achieved which still guarantees reliable transportation for each FEV owner. The Mobility 2. 0 envisioned application acts as a service platform that helps drivers to plan their trip and simultaneously manage the charge of their FEV through their personal <b>nomadic</b> <b>device.</b> This {{can be achieved by}} using real time information about the FEV parameters (e. g. vehicle dynamics and energy stored in the batteries), combined with external parameters (e. g. conditions of road traffic, public transport schedules, state of the grid) and learned driver profiles in order to both determine the range autonomy accurately but also provide a multi- modal commute trip recommendation to the FEV user.

30|$|To {{address the}} {{challenges}} of connectivity and safe use in cars of <b>nomadic</b> <b>devices</b> the AIDE integrated project established a Nomadic Device Forum that brought together representatives of the key stakeholders involved in this field. The activity of the Forum addressed the most important use cases and requirements to define the perspectives of a common “nomadic device gateway” for the integration of portable devices in the vehicles {{in compliance with the}} European Statement of Principles (ESoP 2) defined by the European Community about in-vehicle HMI.|$|E
30|$|Large Field Operational Tests such as euroFOT (studying {{the use of}} Advanced Driver Support Systems, www.eurofot-ip.eu) and TeleFOT (studying the use of <b>nomadic</b> <b>devices,</b> www.telefot.eu) used NDS {{methods to}} {{investigate}} the behaviour of drivers while driving with new intelligent transport systems. While NDS {{tend to focus on}} crash-explanatory factors, Field Operational Tests generally focus on evaluation of systems or functions, however, the data collected in both types of studies can be used for many alternative purposes, such as analysis of Environment, Efficiency and Mobility impacts.|$|E
30|$|Small {{sample size}} {{particularly}} {{was an issue}} {{in this study and}} further studies should aim to use larger samples where possible as well as automating the data analysis process. It should also be remembered that in both FOTs, it was only possible to examine segments of the drive to address the Distraction question. For a more comprehensive evaluation, it would have been necessary to examine on a frame-by-frame basis all of the video data for all of the individual drivers in all of the tests. However, with the available resources and project duration, it was only possible to analyse the video data for a sample of participants for which visual behaviour data was available. For these drivers, it was also only possible to select certain segments of the route driven. Whilst every effort was made to ensure that the segments (road junctions) that were chosen were both the most demanding in a visual and cognitive workload sense and where reliance on the <b>nomadic</b> <b>device</b> was high (and hence whether the risk of distraction was thought to be at its maximum), the fact remains that the sample size is small overall and nothing can be learned regarding the driving during other segments of the route. Although an initial attempt was made to overcome this dilemma by automating the visual data collection process (using eye-tacking equipment) this was not successful as it became apparent that the version of eye-tracking equipment used, which normally works extremely well in carefully controlled laboratory environments did not work well in the situations in this study where the environment is very variable and changes rapidly (due to differential lighting). As this technology has been significantly improved in recent times, it is unlikely that this same problem would be evident with a more state-of-the-art eye-tracking device.|$|R
40|$|Connected Cruise Control (CCC) is a system, that is {{currently}} under development within a HTAS project. CCC aims to improve throughput in dense motorway traffic by advising drivers how to drive. The advice will integrate a lane advice, a headway advice and speed advice. The CCC advice will be provided via a <b>nomadic</b> <b>device,</b> using input from traffic flow predictions, loop data, floating car data and data of the direct surroundings from a camera inside the vehicle. The advantage of CCC lies in the potentially rapid implementation, in contrast to Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) systems. An additional advantage is the support in terms of lateral driver behaviour advice, However, since it is an advisory system, the actual effectiveness of the system totally depends on the driver response: Is a driver capable and willing {{to adhere to the}} advice? If not, the CCC system will not have any beneficial effect on throughput. A way to include the driver capabilities and willingness to accept the advice is to focus on use cases. Also, it is important to include the driver in the actual design by early driving simulator experiments and including Human Factors knowledge {{in the design of the}} HMI (Human Machine lnterface). A large user survey with over 230 respondents has been done, looking into driver frustratÌons in driving in dense motorway traffic. lf the system can reduce some of the frustrations, acceptance of the rsystem will increase. This paper will discuss the possibilities and need of ADAS to solve specific driver problems in congestion, and discusses the outcomes of a first driving simulator experiment related to headway advice. The possibilities for driver feedback are discussed and the next set of experiments for the CCC system from a human factors point of view are discussed...|$|R

This was done in order to identify what findings in the TeleFOT project (so far) has a unique and from the FESTA Handbook deviating approach. The intention has been to highlight these deviations (or improvements) in order to widen the potential use of the FOT methodology in the future. This IP-level deliverable is therefore focused on what constitutes the unique features of TeleFOT that could have an impact also on a more general level.

40|$|Two {{important}} trends {{have marked}} {{the past three}} decennia. The first is the digitization of almost all information generated and consumed by modern society. One only has {{to think of the}} myriad of electronic devices that have penetrated into our personal lives, ranging from digital camera's, DVD-players, mp 3 -players, TVs, etc [...] . The second important trend was the liberation of our communication devices from their tethers. The convergence of IT technology and wireless communication was inevitable and the last five years of this decennium have seen an incredible push towards <b>nomadic</b> information <b>devices.</b> Information availability became a prime requirement for people ever since the advent of the Internet about 15 years ago. It had never been so easy to gather information about every aspect of life and on this scale. As years went by users were no longer content to access their information on a fixed terminal, which created a huge demand for wireless Internet access and mobile data processing devices. These devices are already embedded in our society, we only have to think about the multitude of smart phones, netbooks and the tablet PCs which are being introduced this year (2010). One of the main technological drivers for these <b>nomadic</b> information <b>devices</b> is increased data speed and flexibility in data access. There are already of whole set of wireless standards present in current devices supplying either wireless access or functionalities like sensing, e. g. WLAN, Bluetooth, 2 G, 3 G, GPS and there are even more lurking over the horizon (4 G/GALILEO,WiMAX, [...] .). Each of these standards requires a dedicated radio transmitter to receive and send data. The radio transmitter sends and receives electromagnetic waves within a certain frequency band and this requires dedicated components able to work on the frequency information of the signals, e. g. frequency generators (clocks) and bandpass filters. The filters and clocks, used in these radio transmitters, are subject to very stringent requirements, which could traditionally only be met by bulky and off-chip components. However the continuous demand for more functionality, smaller size and longer battery life is driving development of new and innovative ways to fabricate these frequency components. This is the area where this work fits in. In this thesis a micro-mechanical component will be studied, which offers the possibility to realize very accurate reference clocks as well as very linear and sharp bandpass filters. Moreover, these components allow monolithic integration on top of CMOS chips, paving the way for compact, low-power and low-cost applications. The goal of this research is to investigate the feasibility of high-frequency CMOS compatible MEMS-resonators fabricated with a silicon-germanium structural layer. This thesis will start by theoretically analyzing the behavior of a mechanical resonators. New contributions in this chapter include analytical models for the electromechanical behavior of the resonator, anchor losses and analytical solutions for arbitrarily shaped resonators. In the next chapter of this thesis the process flow for the resonators will be presented. The focus will be put on two process modules for creating high-aspect ratio narrow trenches, which are essential to fabricate high frequency resonators. The followingchapter presents a study of silicon-germanium as a structural material for micromechanical resonators. An extensive study was done to evaluate and identify the intrinsic acoustical losses in silicon-germanium as these losses have an important impact on the device performance. The thesis finishes with a study of different resonator topologies and introduces an alternative use for micromechanical resonators asintegrated radiation sensors. status: publishe...|$|R
