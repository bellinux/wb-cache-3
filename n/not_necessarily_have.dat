5|$|A strain {{known as}} Patch Hounds was {{developed}} by Willet Randall and his family from 1896 specifically for their rabbit hunting ability. They trace their bloodline back to Field Champion Patch, but do <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> a patchwork marking.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the baths {{served as}} {{community}} spaces for gay men. Even now, some men {{choose to go}} to the baths with their friends (even though they may <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> sex with each other). While many men talk to each other at the baths, even forming long-lasting friendships or relationships, many others do not, preferring, for various reasons, anonymity.|$|E
5|$|A stone coffin {{found during}} the 2012 {{excavation}} was opened {{for the first}} time, revealing a lead coffin inside. An investigation with an endoscope revealed {{the presence of a}} skeleton along with some head hair and fragments of a shroud and cord. The skeleton was at first assumed to be male, perhaps that of a knight called Sir William de Moton who was known to have been buried there, but later examination showed it to be of a woman—perhaps a high-ranking benefactress. She may <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> been local, as lead coffins were used to transport corpses over long distances.|$|E

5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} {{section of a}} DNA {{sequence}} comprises a gene is difficult. Regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers do <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> {{to be close to}} the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns can be much larger than its exons. Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome.|$|E
5|$|The dodos on this islet may <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> {{been the}} last members of the species. The last claimed {{sighting}} of a dodo {{was reported in the}} hunting records of Isaac Johannes Lamotius in 1688. Statistical analysis of these records by Roberts and Solow gives a new estimated extinction date of 1693, with a 95% confidence interval of 1688–1715. The authors also pointed out that because the last sighting before 1662 was in 1638, the dodo was probably already quite rare by the 1660s, and thus a disputed report from 1674 by an escaped slave cannot be dismissed out of hand.|$|E

25|$|Another {{commonly}} cited {{approach was}} attempting to transfer the essence of youth from young people to old. Some examples of this approach were sleeping with virgins or children (sometimes literally sleeping, <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>having</b> sex), bathing in or drinking their blood.|$|R
50|$|Shunamitism is the {{practice}} {{of an old man}} sleeping with, but <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>having</b> sex with, a young virgin to preserve his youth. The rationale was that the heat and moisture of the young woman would transfer to the old man and revitalize him.|$|R

5|$|Thrum's Hawaiian Almanac and Annual for 1883 {{reported}} Kalākaua's tour expense {{appropriated by}} the government as $22,500, although his personal correspondence indicates he exceeded that early on, and exact tallies of the trip are not known. Any non-government private expenses or debts would <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> become public. In a letter to Liliuokalani in June, the King stated they were already in danger of running out of funds to complete the trip, and that money was owed to Italy {{for the education of}} the young men who had been entrusted to Moreno. The many awards and decorations he bestowed during the trip cost the kingdom more money.|$|E

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} is the study of the extension of Banach contraction principle to the case of non-self mappings.

50|$|The {{economy is}} {{dominated}} by the informal sector, which is characterized by petty commodity production, and workers <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>having</b> salaries. Traditional, informal trade is widespread and concentrated around markets and major roads, as well as in outlets in neighborhoods. There are also instances of modern economic practices with workplaces having qualified, stable labor forces, or more traditional forms of business such as family businesses.|$|R
50|$|This {{conflict}} goes {{much deeper}} than computer programming practices, (though it clearly has parallels in software engineering). For philosophical or possibly scientific reasons, some people believe that intelligence is fundamentally rational, and can best be represented by logical systems incorporating truth maintenance. Others believe that intelligence is best implemented as a mass of learned or evolved hacks, <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>having</b> internal consistency or any unifying organizational framework.|$|R

25|$|Religion {{has several}} definitions. Religions that are {{organized}} {{can be seen}} as cultural systems, with corresponding behavior and practice.

25|$|Delusions do <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> to {{be false}} or 'incorrect inferences about {{external}} reality'.

30|$|Available capacity: This {{approach}} {{considers the}} available resource capacity instead of resource utilization {{as a measure}} of determining underloaded PMs. This is done by selecting a PM with an available capacity which is the least among all candidate PMs. The main drawback of this technique is that PMs with adequate resources <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>has</b> less power than the others. Also, it does not consider the number of VM on a specific host.|$|R
25|$|The actual {{structure}} {{of any given}} clan can vary. Despite the name decina, they do <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> ten soldiers, but can have anything from five to thirty. Some clans are so small that they don't even have decinas and capodecinas, and even in large clans certain soldiers may report directly to the boss.|$|E
