25|$|The Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) is a Mars {{telecommunications}} orbiter {{and atmospheric}} gas analyzer mission that was launched on 14 March 2016. The spacecraft {{arrived in the}} Martian orbit in October 2016. It delivered the ExoMars Schiaparelli EDM lander and then proceed to map the sources of methane on Mars and other gases, and in doing so, help select the landing site for the ExoMars rover to be launched in 2020. The presence of methane in Mars' atmosphere is intriguing because its likely origin is either present-day life or geological activity. Upon {{the arrival of the}} rover in 2021, the orbiter would be transferred into a lower orbit where it would be able to perform analytical science activities as well as provide the Schiaparelli EDM lander and ExoMars rover with telecommunication relay. NASA provided an Electra telecommunications relay and <b>navigation</b> <b>instrument</b> to ensure communications between probes and rovers on the surface of Mars and controllers on Earth. The TGO would continue serving as a telecommunication relay satellite for future landed missions until 2022.|$|E

50|$|The {{failure in}} {{navigation}} has been ascribed to an out-of-adjustment celestial <b>navigation</b> <b>instrument,</b> a bubble octant, that gave a systematic bias {{to all of}} its readings.

This unnecessary ditching spurred {{on the development of}} improved navigational instruments and also better survival gear for the air crewmen. The B-17's aircraft commander, former American Airlines pilot Captain William T.

Examined with microscope, the investigation revealed that during the impact, the glide path indicator had been positioned just above the centre [...] "on glide" [...] position, which means, the glide path has been captured. Investigators also revealed that all NAV instruments were following the glide path, although the aircraft was flying below the nominal glide path.

50|$|Maritime {{navigation}} using {{scientific instruments}} {{such as the}} mariner's astrolabe first occurred in the Mediterranean during the Middle Ages. Although land astrolabes were invented in the Hellenistic period and existed in classical antiquity and the Islamic Golden Age, the oldest record of a sea astrolabe is that of Majorcan astronomer Ramon Llull dating from 1295. The perfecting of this <b>navigation</b> <b>instrument</b> is attributed to Portuguese navigators during early Portuguese discoveries in the Age of Discovery. The earliest known description of how to make and use a sea astrolabe comes from Spanish cosmographer Melvin Mel Pros Cespedes's Arte de Navegar (The Art of Navigation) published in 1551, {{based on the principle}} of the archipendulum used in constructing the Egyptian pyramids.|$|E
