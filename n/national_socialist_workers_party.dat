50|$|Until 1933 Furugård was {{the main}} leader of the Swedish extreme right, and he was portrayed by his {{followers}} as future Führer of Sweden (Swedish: riksledare) {{in the event of}} a National Socialist seizure of power.

50|$|The “German Workers Party” {{had already}} been founded in Bohemia as early as 1903. It was then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. It {{supported}} German nationalism and anti-clericalism but at first was not particularly anti-Semitic. This party stood mainly for making Austria and the Austrian Germans a part of Germany. In 1909 lawyer, Walter Riehl joined the party and he became leader in 1918. Soon after that the name was changed to the German <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party.</b> After {{the fall of the}} monarchy, the party split into a Czechoslovakian party and an Austrian party under Riehl. From 1920 onwards this Austrian party cooperated closely with the German Workers Party or German <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>workers</b> <b>party</b> formed in Munich which Adolf Hitler led after 1921. In 1923 Riehl’s party had about 23,000 members and was a marginal factor in Austrian politics. In 1924 there was another split and Karl Schulz led a splinter group. The two opposed each other. In 1926 Richard Suchenwirth founded the Austrian branch of Hitler’s German National Socialist party in Vienna. Around that time Benito Mussolini formed his Fascist dictatorship in Italy and became an important ally of the far right.|$|E
50|$|In 1931, {{prior to}} its rise to power, the Nazi Party {{established}} the Auslandsorganisation der NSDAP (Foreign Organisation of the German <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party),</b> whose task was to disseminate Nazi propaganda among the German minorities living outside Germany. In 1936, the Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle (Ethnic German Welfare Office), commonly known as VoMi, was set up {{under the direction of}} Himmler as RKFDV of the German Schutzstaffel (SS) as the liaison bureau for ethnic Germans and was headed by SS-Obergruppenführer Werner Lorenz.|$|E
50|$|In 1945, {{during the}} {{occupation}} of Austria by the Allied powers, Stetter was dismissed from his positions at the University of Vienna, because of his membership in the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (<b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party).</b> From 1946 to 1948, {{he did not have}} a steady income; during this time, he worked in Zell am See for the Salzburg provincial government (Salzburger Landesregierung) and the American military government (amerikanische Militärregierung) on dust protection devices (Staubschutzgeräten). In 1949, he did pioneering work on an optical dust measuring device (optisches Staubmessgerät) for the German Coal Mining Association (deutschen Steinkohlenbergbauverein).|$|E

50|$|Apparently, Pompe was not {{a member}} of the <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party.</b> In his de-Nazification {{application}} of April 23, 1946, he indicated that he was a member of Organisation Todt and, from fall 1943, a member of Transportkorps Speer, with the rank of Obertruppführer. He classified himself as innocent (“unbelastet”) and continued to live under his real name. In 1951 Pompe moved from Höchberg near Würzburg to Schweinfurt where he was employed by Vereinigte Kugellager Fabriken AG as a laborer. In the 1970s, a West German court became aware of some of Pompe’s war-time deeds in the context of investigating members of Dienststelle Schmelt, but he was not identified until 2008.|$|E
50|$|Mentzel {{studied and}} gained B.Sc. in Mathematics and B.S. in Chemistry at the Georg-August University of Göttingen, and he {{received}} his doctorate in 1925 with a thesis on Stereoisomerism and transformation of b-substituted decahydro-naphthalenes. At Göttingen, he was a Kreisleiter (circuit leader) of the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP, <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party),</b> {{of which he had}} been a member since 1922. Due to his participation in the Kapp putsch in 1920, he held a golden party badge. Mentzel completed his Habilitation in 1933 at the Justus Liebig-Universität Gießen with a top-secret Habilitationsschrift (thesis) on Wehrchemie (military chemistry - the military use of poison gases).|$|E
50|$|In 1923 Adolf Hitler and his supporters, {{who were}} then {{concentrated}} in Munich, staged the Beer Hall Putsch, {{an attempt to}} overthrow the Weimar Republic and seize power. The revolt failed, resulting in Hitler's arrest and the temporary crippling of the Nazi Party, which was virtually unknown outside Munich. The city once again became a Nazi stronghold when the National Socialists took power in Germany in 1933. The <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> created their first concentration camp at Dachau, 16 km north-west of the city. Because of its importance {{to the rise of}} National Socialism, Munich was referred to as the Hauptstadt der Bewegung ("Capital of the Movement"). The NSDAP headquarters were in Munich and many Führerbauten ("Führer-buildings") were built around the Königsplatz, some of which have survived to this day.|$|E

50|$|Not {{very much}} is {{publicly}} known about Sommerlath's Nazi affiliations. Living as a German citizen in São Paulo, Brazil, Sommerlath joined as an expatriate member the German <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Worker's</b> <b>Party,</b> NSDAP/AO, on December 1, 1934, as member no. 3592030. His brother Paul Sommerlath {{had joined the}} Party in 1933. Most Germans in Brazil chose not to be members in the party. This is why Brazil's president, Getulio Vargas, found no real opposition {{when he decided to}} outlaw it (1938). The Sommerlath brothers remained members of the Nazi party until the party was banned and dissolved by the allies in 1945.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} the human zoo has not {{completely}} disappeared. The first world leader to officially and systematically ban human zoos were the Nazis, under Adolf Hitler’s orders. Most assume this was a political move to create emotional sway among the public. Whether {{or not it was}} to increase their popularity the <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>party</b> of Germany was the first political organization to actively remove human zoos from their public and private enterprises. The Nazis also fined, imprisoned and even tortured some of the main proponents and perpetrators of human zoos. A Congolese village was displayed at the Brussels 1958 World's Fair. In April 1994, an example of an Ivory Coast village was presented as part of an African safari in Port-Saint-Père, near Nantes, in France, later called Planète Sauvage.|$|E
50|$|Kyrkliga Folkpartiet (Clerical People's Party or Popular Party) a minor pro-fascist {{party in}} Sweden founded in 1930. The party was formed a led by Ivar Rhedin, {{a priest in}} the Church of Sweden. Rhedin was the editor of Göteborgs Stiftstidning (Magazine of the Diocese of Gothenburg), in which he wrote many pro-German articles. The party was an ally of the main Nazi party in Sweden, <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party.</b> But the {{cooperation}} {{between the two parties}} didn't last. Although both groups were staunch antisemites, their approaches toward the Jews were somewhat different. Rhedin, as a conservative Christian, was against the Jews as a religious community. NSAP were against the Jews as a race. Rhedin had no problem in accepting Jews who converted to Christianity, whereas NSAP and other nazi groups considered that converted Jews continued to be Jews in racial aspects. The party was closed down in 1936.|$|E
50|$|In 1933, SNSP {{underwent}} a major split. A conflict between Furugård and Lindholm had simmered since 1932. The conflict {{emerged from a}} dispute between Lindholm (who had a somewhat more leftist approach) and the Göteborg party branch (in {{the hands of the}} more conservative elements). Furugård remained close to the Göteborg branch, and to some extent he became economically dependent on them. Gradually, tension grew between Furugård and Lindholm. On January 13, 1933, Furugård expelled Lindholm and his followers from the party, after a chaotic meeting of the Great Council. In response, Lindholm set up a party of his own, the <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> (NSAP) on January 14, 1933. Moreover, Lindholm sent out a declaration to the party branches accusing Furugård of corruption. The SA leader, Hedengren, sided with Lindholm. Many younger party members would also join Lindholm's party. Following the split, SNSP was commonly nicknamed Furugårdspartiet ('The Furugård Party') or Furugårdarna to distinguish the party from Lindholmarna.|$|E

50|$|One member, Anton Drexler, {{went on to}} form {{a similar}} organization, the German Workers' Party, which later became the <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> German <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> (Nazi Party) that {{came to power in}} 1933 under Adolf Hitler.|$|R
