5|$|The {{ships which}} sail the {{southern}} sea {{and south of}} it are like houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky. Their rudders are several tens of feet long. A single ship carries several hundred men, and has in the stores a year's supply of grain. Pigs are fed and wine fermented on board. There is no account of dead or living, no {{going back to the}} mainland when once the people have set forth upon the caerulean sea. At daybreak, when the gong sounds aboard the ship, the animals can drink their fill, and crew and passengers alike forget all dangers. To those on board everything is hidden and lost in space, mountains, landmarks, and the countries of foreigners. The shipmaster may say 'To make such and such a country, with a favourable wind, in so many days, we should sight such and such a mountain, (then) the ship must steer in such and such a direction'. But suddenly the wind may fall, and may not be strong enough to allow of the sighting of the mountain on the given day; in such a case, bearings may have to be changed. And the ship (on the other hand) may be carried far beyond (the landmark) and may lose its bearings. A gale may spring up, the ship may be blown hither and thither, it may meet with shoals or be driven upon hidden rocks, then it may be broken to the very roofs (of its deckhouses). A great ship with heavy cargo has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> the high seas, but rather in shallow water it will come to grief.|$|E
25|$|In non-Orthodox {{denominations}} of Judaism most rabbis {{hold that}} Jews have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> engaging in theological dialogue, {{and may have}} much to gain. Some hold that in practice Soloveitchik's distinctions are not viable, for any group that has sustained discussion and participation on moral issues will implicitly involve theological discourse. Thus, since informal implicit theological dialogue will occur, one might as well admit it and publicly work on formal theological dialogue.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} films {{in which his}} {{character}} made an appearance, Stalin took {{a keen interest in}} the work on The Fall of Berlin. The premier intervened in Pavlenko's writing, read the screenplay's manuscript and corrected several grammatical mistakes; he also deleted a short sequence during which a German civilian in Berlin exhorted his family to hasten and flee as the Red Army approaches. German historian Lars Karl believed this signaled his resolution to demonstrate that the civilian populace had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> the Soviets. The picture was the first feature film about the Battle of Berlin and the events in Hitler's bunker, preceding Der letzte Akt by five years.|$|E

25|$|Thanks to Ingrid; {{the spell}} of {{shattered}} sight is finally broken, the shards turn into snow and Storybrooke returns to normal, including Regina and Mary Margaret, who immediately stop fighting and start laughing. Mary Margaret and David run up to Emma to hug her, while Henry runs to Regina and hugs both her and Emma. As Neal begins to wake up, David tells Mary Margaret to forget what happened under the curse, then the couple kiss. Finally, Gold checks on Belle as she is sleeping, when Hook arrived to the pawnshop and tells him Henry got away. Gold asks how he failed at kidnapping a child, only to have Hook respond to that answer by saying his heart wasn't in it. Since Gold knows that the Snow Queen’s plan failed, he tells Hook it’s his last day on earth. Hook makes a final request as a dying wish to leave Emma {{and the rest of}} Storybrooke intact. Gold says as long as Emma doesn't get in his way, she’ll survive. He says once he steps over the line with his magic, they have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> him – but says he can’t make that promise {{for the rest of the}} world. Confident that he will go through with his plans, a smug but sinister Gold leaves the pawnshop to walk out into the fresh Storybrooke snowy air.|$|E

He had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> whatever comparisons might result. Nor did he confine his views to private consumption. Tchaikovsky openly supported the musical efforts of Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov, despite a widely held view that they were musical enemies. In an interview printed in the weekly newspaper Saint Petersburg Life (Peterburgskaia zhizn) in November 1892, he said, ...|$|E

500|$|Author Brett Alan Weiss {{wrote that}} Skeet Shoot was [...] "a shoddily programmed, {{graphically}} primitive game" [...] {{and said that}} the poor controls and difficulty levels rendered the game [...] "virtually worthless". A writer for Atari HQ called it a mediocre game. Lee Peppas of ANALOG Computing remarked that [...] "Atari & Activision have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> the graphics on this first release."

[...] Of all of the religious works Priestley published in the United States, and there were many, it was his four-volume General History that was the most important. Stretching from 475 CE to Priestley's present, he tracked and explained what he saw as the history of Christianity and its [...] "corruptions", referencing his own An History of the Corruptions of Christianity (1772–74). However, he ended it by praising American religious toleration.|$|E
500|$|The June 21, 1915 {{commutation}} provoked Tom Watson into advocating Frank's lynching. He {{wrote in}} The Jeffersonian and Watson's Magazine: [...] "This country has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> its rural communities. Lynch {{law is a}} good sign; it shows that a sense of justice lives among the people." [...] A group of prominent men organized themselves into the [...] "Knights of Mary Phagan" [...] and openly planned to kidnap Frank from prison. They consisted of 28 men with various skills: an electrician was to cut the prison wires, car mechanics were to keep the cars running, {{and there was a}} locksmith, a telephone man, a medic, a hangman, and a [...] The ringleaders were well known locally, but were not named publicly until June 2000, when a local librarian posted a list on the Web, based on information compiled by Mary Phagan's great-niece, Mary Phagan Kean (b. 1953). The list included Joseph Mackey Brown, former governor of Georgia; Eugene Herbert Clay, former mayor of Marietta and later president of the Georgia Senate; E. P. Dobbs, mayor of Marietta at the time; Moultrie McKinney Sessions, lawyer and banker; part of the Marietta delegation at Governor Slaton's clemency hearing; several current and former Cobb County sheriffs; and other individuals of various professions.|$|E
500|$|Lord Brown concurred. [...] He {{said that}} [...] "the gains to {{be derived from}} denying [...] {{immunity}} from suit for breach of that duty substantially exceed whatever loss might be thought likely to result from this", since a potential liability would lead to a [...] "sharpened awareness of the risks of pitching their initial views of the merits of their client’s case too high or too inflexibly lest these views come to expose and embarrass them at a later date." [...] He thought that this was a [...] "healthy development". It would also ensure that a client who was caused loss by an expert witness acting in [...] "an egregious manner" [...] would receive a proper remedy; he said that such cases were likely to be [...] "highly exceptional". Lord Collins, agreeing, noted that the result did not affect the position of the expert vis-a-vis the opposing litigant, where there were [...] "wider considerations of policy" [...] against allowing claims. He also remarked that the existing ability to prosecute expert witnesses for perjury or to take disciplinary proceedings against them for unprofessional conduct in preparing or presenting their evidence did not fit with the claim that a liability to their clients for breach of duty would have a chilling effect on experts' willingness to give evidence. Lord Kerr, who also agreed with the decision, said that if [...] "an expert expresses an honestly held view, even if it differs from that which he may have originally expressed, provided it is an opinion which is tenable, he has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> a disgruntled party." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{that day}} Peter {{remained}} hidden in that hollow log. He {{did not dare}} put foot outside until the Black Shadows began to creep through the Green Forest.

Once more Peter's thoughts were chiefly of his stomach, for it was very, very empty.|$|R
60|$|When Peter {{knew that}} he had <b>nothing</b> more <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> Eisenkopf, he rode on slowly till he came to a small white house.

Boxmeer had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> the Reformation taking place at that time in the Netherlands. Boxmeer was part of the Diocese of Roermond, which by 14 August 1653 granted authorisation to the founding of the convent in Boxmeer.|$|E

"Ay, there's <b>nothing</b> more <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> the rascals to-night, {{if we keep}} a good look-out--and {{that may}} be done as {{effectively}} by three of us as by six.

2500|$|Valentine's {{first season}} at Shea {{did not go}} as well as planned. It did, however, have an {{interesting}} side effect on the Mets' line-up. Dave Kingman, who batted fourth in the Mets' line-up, began seeing better pitches with Valentine behind him. Over the first sixteen games in which Kingman and Valentine batted fourth and fifth in the line-up, Kingman clubbed seven home runs with sixteen RBIs. Valentine, meanwhile, batted just [...]176 over that stretch with one home run and seven RBIs. Almost as if National League pitchers realized they had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> Valentine's bat, Kingman began seeing tougher pitching again, and hit just three more home runs {{over the rest of}} the season.|$|E
2500|$|Moscoe stood down as TTC chair {{following}} the 2006 election, and {{was selected as}} chair of Toronto's licensing and standards committee.

The plan calls for landlords to pay a high per-unit fee if their properties are run down, and a low fee if the buildings are in good shape. [...] "Good landlords have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> the licensing scheme because the amounts they are going to pay will be marginal," [...] he has said.

One is, that he contrived some way to drown him in the sea; another, that he poisoned him; and a third, that he killed him in the forests, {{when he was out}} on a hunting excursion.
