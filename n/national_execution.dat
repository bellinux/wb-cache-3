40|$|This study empirically {{investigates the}} {{transposition}} patterns of European Union EU directives in 15 Member States and in 5 major {{sectors of the}} economy with a view to analysing the political-economic reasons behind sector and national differences in <b>national</b> <b>execution</b> measures. Specifically, we analyse whether, in the course of transposition, EU directives pass the respective national parliaments or not. Neglected in the scientific literature so far, this question is highly relevant from a normative political perspective and complements the debate on the EU's; democratic deficit by focusing on the national implementation of EU law. Based on information contained in CELEX and EUR-lex, our newly constructed dataset allows us to analyse Member States' transposition performances in a novel fashion, namely across time, Member States as well as policy areas. Our empirical analysis reveals generally low primary transposition ratios. Put differently, most of EU directives are transposed by national executives rather than national legislators. Further, remarkable differences in primary transposition ratios are detected along all three data dimensions. We hypothesize that national political-institutional constellations, economic sector characteristics and EU membership benefits are the main explanatory factors behind these differences.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In recent decades, {{necessity}} to protect environment {{has been a}} serious concern for all people and international communities. In appropriate development of human economic activities, subsistence dependence of the growing world population on nature decreases the natural diversity of ecosystems and habitats day by day and provides additional constraints for life and survival of wildlife. As a result, implementation of programs to protect species and ecosystems is of great importance. The current study was carried out to implement a comprehensive strategic environmental management plan in the Mond protected area in southern Iran. Accordingly, the protected area was zoned using multi criteria decision method. According to the numerical models, fifteen data layer were obtained {{on a scale of}} 1 : 50, 000. The results revealed that 28. 35 % out of the entire study area belongs to nature conservation zone. In the following step, in order to offer the strategic planning using strength, weaknesses, opportunities and threats method, a total number of 154 questionnaires were prepared and filled by the relevant experts. For this purpose, after identifying the internal and external factors, they were weighted in the form of matrices as; internal factor evaluation and external factor evaluation. Analytical hierarchy process and expert choice software were applied to weight the factors. At the end, by considering the socioeconomic and environmental issues, the strategy of using protective strategies in line with international standards as well as a strong support of governmental <b>national</b> <b>execution</b> with a score of 6. 05 was chosen as the final approach...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{immunity from}} execution of state property in execution proceedings of arbitral awards. In this study, I aim to consider the extent of {{immunity from execution}} in these execution proceedings. This includes considerations of current rules in public international law on immunity from execution {{and the application of}} these rules on <b>national</b> <b>execution</b> proceedings of arbitral awards. Immunity from execution protects state property from execution measures. Immunity from execution is based on equality of states and the upholding of friendly relations between states. States have in the 20 th century started to participate in commercial transactions and dealings with individuals. This has led to the revision of the traditionally absolute notion of immunity from execution. Immunity from execution has been limited in certain instances. The view on the extent of immunity from execution is not always coherent in the international community. There is no universal international convention in force that regulates the matter. National courts interpret the rules on immunity from execution, which means that there can be quite incoherent and unexpected decisions in this area of public international law. The certainty of execution is of crucial importance in relation to arbitral proceedings. Immunity from execution is a factor that compromises this certainty. As arbitration is time-consuming and costly, uncertainty relating to the execution of arbitral awards can mean that individuals refrain from arbitrating against states. This, again, can impact trade and investment involving states. The Sedelmayer saga is an excellent illustration of the implications that immunity from execution can have on execution of mixed arbitral awards. Sedelmayer is an investor whose investment was expropriated by the Russian Federation. An arbitral award was subsequently rendered against Russia. Sedelmayer has sought execution against Russian property in both Germany and Sweden over the last 13 years, without fully succeeding to satisfy the award. He also appealed to the European Court of Human Rights on the ground of the German proceedings. In this thesis, I will critically consider the implications that immunity from execution can have on execution of arbitral awards. Regard will be taken to sources of public international law, especially treaties and customary international law. I will also examine domestic legislation and case law in order to accurately consider national perceptions and tendencies of immunity from execution. I will especially use the Sedelmayer saga as an illustrating and exemplifying series of case law...|$|E

We investigated the role of visual (V 1), posterior parietal (PPC), and frontal motor (fMC) cortices for sensorimotor mapping in mice during performance of a memory-guided visual discrimination task. Large-scale calcium imaging revealed that V 1, PPC, and fMC neurons exhibited heterogeneous responses spanning all task epochs (stimulus, delay, response). Population analyses demonstrated unique encoding of stimulus identity and behavioral choice information across regions, with V 1 encoding stimulus, fMC encoding choice even early in the trial, and PPC multiplexing the two variables. Optogenetic inhibition during behavior revealed that all regions were necessary during the stimulus epoch, but only fMC was required during the delay and response epochs. Stimulus identity can thus be rapidly transformed into behavioral choice, requiring V 1, PPC, and fMC during the transformation period, but only fMC for maintaining the choice in memory prior to <b>execution.</b> <b>National</b> Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (U.

40|$|High-performance {{concurrent}} priority queues {{are essential}} for applications such as task scheduling and discrete event simulation. Unfortunately, even the best performing implementations do not scale past a number of threads in the single digits. This {{is because of the}} sequential bottleneck in accessing the elements {{at the head of the}} queue in order to perform a DeleteMin operation. In this paper, we present the SprayList, a scalable priority queue with relaxed ordering semantics. Starting from a non-blocking SkipList, the main innovation behind our design is that the DeleteMin operations avoid a sequential bottleneck by "spraying'' themselves onto the head of the SkipList list in a coordinated fashion. The spraying is implemented using a carefully designed random walk, so that DeleteMin returns an element among the first O(p log[superscript 3] p) in the list, with high probability, where p is the number of threads. We prove that the running time of a DeleteMin operation is O(log[superscript 3] p), with high probability, independent of the size of the list. Our experiments show that the relaxed semantics allow the data structure to scale for high thread counts, comparable to a classic unordered SkipList. Furthermore, we observe that, for reasonably parallel workloads, the scalability benefits of relaxation considerably outweigh the additional work due to out-of-order <b>execution.</b> <b>National</b> Science Foundation (U.

40|$|Nowadays, {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs) {{are considered}} an essential candidate to apply structural health monitoring (SHM). An important problem {{in this area is}} sensor placement optimization. In many research works, solving this problem focuses only on the network properties and requirements such as energy consumption, network coverage, …etc., without considering the civil engineering requirements. However, there are other research works that consider network and civil requirements while optimizing the sensor placement. Unfortunately, although minimizing the number of sensors is important, it has never been addressed. This could be noticed from the limited literature found that addresses this problem while considering both the civil and the network requirements. As a result, in this thesis we study the problem of minimizing the number of sensors for SHM in WSNs. The idea behind this research is to reduce the network size, which can solve some problems such as the scalability, installation time and cost. Our contribution in this work {{is not limited to the}} mathematical model of the mentioned problem, but will extend to solve the problem using different methods: the exhaustive search, genetic algorithm (GA), and a heuristic algorithm that applies the binary search. The problem is then solved for different number of sensors as well as different placements in many conducted experiments. Finally, the time complexity is evaluated to compare between all the applied methods. The obtained results showed that minimizing the number of sensors becomes more significant with big structures. Furthermore, the binary search algorithm is the best to use to solve the problem for small buildings. But, For larger buildings, there is a trade-off between the performance, and time complexity, where binary search gives optimal solution, but genetic algorithm gives better time <b>execution.</b> <b>National</b> Priorities Research Program (NPRP- 6 - 150 - 2 - 059) funded by Qatar National Research Fun...|$|R
