40|$|Today's {{economic}} {{demands in}} manufacturing drive {{the requirements for}} high precision and productivity rates in machine tools design. One {{of the most common}} used machine tool drives for linear motion is the ball screw drive (BSD), which converts rotational motion of the servo motor to linear motion of the machine tool structural component. The advantages of modern BSD are high rigidity and low friction, and therefore a high efficiency compared to alternative systems like rack and pinion systems. However, to achieve the required accuracy it is necessary to preload the ball screw drive to prevent backlash. Backlash is caused by the clearance between the contacts of the ball bearings and the threads of the nut and screw. Clearance, however, is needed to prevent unnecessary friction during operation of the BSD. Different preload levels, on one hand, determine the rigidity and thus the maximum load a drive can carry and, on the other hand, the amount of heat to be dissipated due to friction which also leads to wear of the components. Due to their high specific workloads and relatively small spatial requirements, shape memory alloys (SMA) possess an outstanding potential to serve as miniaturized positioning devices in adaptronic and mechatronic applications. In comparison to other actuators such as hydraulics, electric motors or piezoelectric actuators, SMA based-actuators have the highest mechanical work output per volume. Nevertheless, most of the known SMA drives are used in the application area of small and lightweight actuators such as flaps and locks in the automotive industry, medical technology and life science. In this paper we present an approach to retrieve a preload loss which causes a loss to positioning accuracy in BSD due to wear over lifetime. The main purposes are reduced maintenance, longer service life and improved workpiece quality by regenerating previous preload conditions which leads to higher gainings for manufacturers. For this purpose, a novel SMA actuator driven module for BSD has been designed. The device was developed to be implemented in standard drives without major changes in component design. It is installed between flanged nut and counter nut and replaces a spacer usually used to define a specific preload. It was required to scale the actuator module over a wide range of screw diameters respectively <b>nut</b> <b>diameters.</b> Besides mechanical properties, thermal boundary conditions during operation of BSD must be taken into consideration. A prototype has been manufactured and tested to evaluate the current design and first results will be introduced...|$|E

40|$|Fracture {{behaviour}} of dika nut under quasi-static loading {{along the}} longitudinal axis and the transverse axis was investigated. The fracture {{resistance of the}} nut was {{measured in terms of}} average force, deformation and toughness at nutshell fracture, and nut stiffness.

The force required to crack the nut increased with <b>nut</b> <b>diameter</b> but was not significantly different in both loading orientations. The mean cracking force was in the range of 2. 06 to 3. 67 kN. The compression of the nut exhibited a pronounced linearity between load and deflection.

This research aims to comprehend further the mechanism of the thread connection with respect to the depth of thread penetration. Tensile strength of thread connection was derived experimentally using two steel rods. The diameter of the first steel rod was Â¾ inch (18. 5 mm) and threaded on one end by 16 threads per inch. The diameter of the second steel rod was 45 mm and functioned as nut. From the results of the experiment, it can be concluded that rod failure will happen if the depth of thread penetration is equal to or bigger than 90 % of <b>nut</b> minor <b>diameter.</b> Meanwhile, thread failure will happen if the depth of thread penetration is less than 90 % of <b>nut</b> minor <b>diameter.</b> It is also shown that the correlation between the number of thread and the maximum load which can be supported by the connection is not linear...|$|R
40|$|A large weevil {{was found}} infesting {{macadamia}} nuts on the Atherton Tableland during the 1994 / 95 season. It was unrepresented in various Australian insect collections but thought {{to belong to}} the genus Sigastus. This paper reports some preliminary studies on its biology, pest status and control. From 4 - 6 weeks after first nut-set adult females commence laying single eggs through the husk, after first scarifying an oviposition site. The nut stalk is then cleaved leading to rapid abscission. Nuts were generally attacked up until hard shell formation. Weevil larvae consumed whole kernels, with % survival higher and larval duration shorter in larger nuts. Infestation rates increased with increasing <b>nut</b> <b>diameter,</b> reaching 72. 8 % of fallen nuts by mid-October. A crop loss of 30 % could be attributed to weevils in an unsprayed orchard. However, adult weevils are very susceptible to both carbaryl and methidathion sprays. In addition, exposure of infested nuts to full sunlight over several weeks kills 100 % of larvae. Crops should be surveyed for weevil damage from the 5 - 10 mm diameter stage until mid-December. Methidathion used as an initial spray for fruitspotting bugs should provide control.

The use of nanoparticulate stabilisers (ca. 30 <b>nut</b> <b>diameter</b> laponite or 9 - 18 nm diameter carbon) in "Pickering" emulsion systems allows stable organic microdroplets to be formed and these are readily deposited onto conventional tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) electrodes. In contrast to the electrically insulating laponite nanoparticles, conducting carbon nanoparticles are shown to effectively catalyse the simultaneous electron transfer and ion transfer process at triple phase boundary junctions.

Large sample of palm kernel nut were cracked using the static impact method, after characterization of the kernel based on the nominal diameter into d 20 mm. The moisture content of the bulk sample {{at the time of}} cracking was 10. 42 %wb. Cracking was carried out using the energy cracking equipment with different hammer masses against various drop heights, while visual observation was used to assess the level of cracking as follows; completely cracked (CCR), completely cracked with slight damage (CCD), cracked without nut separation (CWS), unable to crack (UCR) and smashed (SMD). The best efficiency of the whole kernels obtained for the various size ranges were 100 %, 100 %, 90 %, 100 % and 90 % respectively, with the cracking energies varying between the size ranges. Results indicate that cracking energy correlated positively with palm kernel nut masses for size ranges, 12 mmd< 15 mm, 15 mmd< 17 mm and 19 mmd 20 mm with low sample correlation coefficient, except for size range 19 mmd 20 mm which had a 59. 62 % proportional variability.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{impinging}} velocitythat gives that maximum cracking {{efficiency of}} a vertical shaft centrifugal palm nut cracking machine was determined in this study. A nut cracking energy instrument {{which consists of}} a hammering mass falling vertically on palm nuts placed on a base {{was used to determine}} potential energy required to crack the nuts. This energy was equated to the kinetic energy required to crack the nuts in a centrifugal palm nut cracking machine, from which the average impinging velocity was determined. Experiment was carried out to generate cracking energy data for both Dura and Tenera varieties of palm nuts available in the study area. For Dura type, highest percentage of fully cracked (FC) nuts and average impinging velocity of 32. 50 m/s were obtained when the height of the hammering mass was set at 0. 15 m, 0. 25 m and 0. 30 m for <b>nuts</b> sorted into <b>diameter</b> ranges of d < 15 mm, 15 mm ≤ d ≤ 18 mm, and 18 mm ≤ d ≤ 22 mm respectively.
