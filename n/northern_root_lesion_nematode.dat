40|$|The aims of {{the study}} were to {{determine}} susceptibility of soybean cultivars to <b>root</b> <b>lesion</b> <b>nematodes</b> (genus Pratylenchus), effect of intensity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization on penetration of endoparasitic nematodes in soybean roots, and trophic biodiversity of nematode community in soybean. In the period 2005 - 2007, investigations were conducted at experimental sites of Agricultural Institute Osijek. Seven soybean cultivars were included (Korana, Kuna, Anica, Una, Ika, Podravka 95 i Tisa). Soil and roots were sampled during four soybean growth stages. Nematode populations from soil and root samples were determined as well as reproductive index (RI) of <b>root</b> <b>lesion</b> <b>nematode</b> population, and intensity of AMF root colonization. Ten ecological indexes were calculated in order to determine trophic biodiversity of nematode community: H’, λ, N 1, N 2, E 1, E 2, PPI, NCR, F/B, B+F/BP. Two Pratylenchus species were determined from the soil samples: P. thornei Sher & Allen 1953 and P. scribneri Steiner 1943. The results indicate negative effect of Pratylenchus spp. (extracted from soil samples) on soybean yields for all but one cultivar (Una). However, increase in <b>root</b> <b>lesion</b> <b>nematode</b> population did not lead to linear decrease in plant biomass. Cultivars Ika, Podravka 95, Tisa and Una proved to be the best hosts to <b>root</b> <b>lesion</b> <b>nematodes</b> since these cultivars statistically differed among cultivars for the highest density of <b>root</b> <b>lesion</b> <b>nematodes.</b> Cultivar Una showed the least susceptibility to <b>root</b> <b>lesion</b> <b>nematodes</b> since it had the lowest RI and negative effects on yields were not determined. Due to high RI values and negative effect on soybean yields. Population densities of <b>root</b> <b>lesion</b> <b>nematodes</b> from soil samples, (compared to nematodes detected in roots) are more reliable indicator of <b>root</b> <b>lesion</b> <b>nematodes</b> damaging potential. Since values of RI for Pratylenchus spp. in soil samples were determined as very high and soybean yields were negatively correlated. Cultivars differed significantly for total nematode community. Plant parasites and bacterial feeding nematode groups were predominant in nematode community for all cultivars, and decomposition of organic matter was mainly bacterial-mediated. Antagonist among the throphic groups of nematodes were not determined. The lowest variability for total population of nematode community was determined for cultivars Korana, Kuna, Una and Podravka 95. The highest population densities of plant parasites and lowest trophic biodiversity were recorded for cultivars Anica and Ika, which supported the dominance of one trophic group (plant parasites). Negative effect of nematode community for the same cultivars was more pronounced than positive. The highest throphic biodiversity was calculated for cultivar Korana. Calculations of Dominance index λ (i. e. Hills N 2) and Evenness index (E 2) revealed the greatest differences among soybean cultivars. These indexes proved to be the most reliable and applicable for evaluation of nematode trophic biodiversity. The intensity of AMF colonization did not significantly affect penetration of endoparasitic nematodes in soybean roots, although cultivars differed statistically for endoparasitic nematodes in roots and percentage of AMF colonization. Cultivars (native plant resistance), compared to intensity of AMF root colonization, was determined as the key factor influencing numbers of <b>root</b> <b>lesion</b> <b>nematodes</b> penetrated in soybean roots. Due to high nematode densities, all cultivars proved good host status for <b>root</b> <b>lesion</b> <b>nematodes.</b> However, satisfactory yields were achieved and cultivars proved tolerance. The potential of <b>root</b> <b>lesion</b> <b>nematodes</b> population to increase in soybeans and impact on soybean yields indicate importance for future nematode population monitoring. The results may contribute in future scientific projects especially breeding projects with the main aim to create more tolerant soybean cultivars against <b>root</b> <b>lesion</b> <b>nematodes.</b> These are the first results in Croatia about relationship between endoparasitic nematodes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in soybean roots. The results may contribute to applied science projects in developments and application of new biological control measures against <b>root</b> <b>lesion</b> <b>nematodes...</b>|$|R

Current nematode control strategies include nematicides, crop rotation, and tolerant cultivars, but these methods have limits. Developing genetic resistance through novel approaches like RNA interference (RNAi) can address these problems. RNAi-mediated silencing of CG disease in walnut (Juglans regia L.) has been achieved previously. We sought to place both CG and nematode resistance into a single walnut rootstock genotype using co-transformation to stack the resistance genes. A. tumefaciens, carrying self-complimentary iaaM and ipt transgenes, and Agrobacterium rhizogenes, carrying a self-complimentary Pv 010 gene from P. vulnus, were used as co-transformation vectors. RolABC genes were introduced by the resident T-DNA in the A. rhizogenes Ri-plasmid used as a vector for plant transformation. Pv 010 and Pv 194 (transgenic control) genes were also transferred separately using A. tumefaciens. To test for resistance, transformed walnut roots were challenged with P. vulnus and microshoots were challenged with a virulent strain of A. tumefaciens. 				 				 					 						Results 					Combining the two bacterial strains at a 1 : 1 rather than 1 : 3 ratio increased the co-transformation efficiency. Although complete immunity to nematode infection was not observed, transgenic lines yielded up to 79 % fewer nematodes per root following in vitro co-culture than untransformed controls. Transgenic line 33 - 3 - 1 exhibited complete crown gall control and 32 % fewer nematodes. The transgenic plants had thicker, longer roots than untransformed controls possibly due to insertion of rolABC genes. When the Pv 010 gene was present in roots with or without rolABC genes there was partial or complete control of RLNs. Transformation using only one vector showed 100 % control in some lines. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					CG and nematode resistance gene stacking controlled CG and RLNs simultaneously in walnuts. Silencing genes encoding iaaM, ipt, and Pv 010 decrease CG formation and RLNs populations in walnut. Beneficial plant genotype and phenotype changes are caused by co-transformation using A. tumefaciens and A. rhizogenes strains.

40|$|Breeding for {{resistance}} to the cereal cyst nematodes (CCN) Heterodera filipjevi (Madzhidov,) Stelter, and H. avenae (Wollenweber) and to the <b>root</b> <b>lesion</b> <b>nematode</b> (RLN) Pratylenchus thornei (Sher & Allen) is presently being undertaken by breeding programs at research institutions in Turkey. This study was carried out to screen for nematode resistance in an advanced spring bread wheat breeding population, 42 lines (F 9) developed at CIMMYT in Mexico, by crossing resistant parent the Middle- Eastern landrace AUS 4930 7. 2 and susceptible parent, the widely adapted, high yielding CIMMYT line, Pastor. The results demonstrate that 31 lines are resistant to P. thornei and 5 lines are resistant to H. filipjevi. Only 4 of these lines (2, 7, 23 and 41) are resistant to both nematodes. Lines 2, 7 and 41 also contain the known resistance gene, Cre 1. Although some lines carry the Cre 1 gene, they are susceptible to either both or one of these nematodes. There is no association among H. filipjevi, P. thornei and Cre 1 resistance {{due to differences in}} the resistance region in the plant genome...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{nematode}} root injuries on banana crop yield is very poorly known in higher {{parts of the}} East African highlands. This study assessed {{the impact of the}} root-lesion nematode, Pratylenchus goodeyi, on growth and yield of three banana cultivars (Musa spp. AAA-EA) in a field experiment involving nematicide and mulch applications at conditions of high altitude (about 1500 m). Plant growth, yield, root damage and nematode population densities were observed over three production cycles. Low to medium levels (50 %) had no effect on plant growth. No significant reduction in bunch weight was associated with high root necrosis in any cycle and any of the three cultivars. Mulch significantly reduced root necrosis and P. goodeyi population densities. Bunch weight significantly increased in all mulched plots irrespective of root necrosis intensity. These results agree with those of earlier surveys in Rwanda that suggested little impact of P. goodeyi on banana yields. However, they challenge general perceptions and previous findings on the negative impact of <b>root</b> <b>lesion</b> <b>nematodes</b> on banana crop performance. status: publishe...|$|R
