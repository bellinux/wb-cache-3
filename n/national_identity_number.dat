40|$|Introduction and Aims: Injecting opioid {{users are}} at {{elevated}} risk of death. Although liver disease (especially hepatitis C) is common, {{its impact on}} mortality is low in active injectors. Because opioid substitution therapy (OST) {{reduces the risk of}} death from directly drug related causes, we hypothesised that the proportion of liver-related deaths would increase in subjects receiving OST. We investigated liver-related mortality in a cohort of injecting opioid users attending a needle exchange program (NEP) in a Swedish city in relation to OST exposure. Design and Methods: Participants enrolled in the NEP between 1987 and 2011 with available <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> <b>numbers,</b> and registered use of opioids, were included. Linkage based on <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> <b>numbers</b> was performed with national registers for death, emigration and prescription of OST. Participants were categorised as non-OST recipients until the registered date of first OST prescription, and hence as OST recipients. Hazard ratios were calculated by Cox regression for overall and liver-related mortality in relation to OST, with OST as a time-dependent variable. Results: Among 4494 NEP participants, 1488 opioid users were identified; 711 / 1488 had been prescribed OST. During a follow-up period of 15546 person-years 368 deaths occurred. Sixteen deaths were caused by liver disease; 10 of these occurred in OST recipients. The risk of liver-related death was significantly increased in OST receiving participants (hazard ratio 3. 08, 95 % confidence interval [1. 09, 8. 68], P= 0. 03). Conclusions: Liver related mortality among opioid users was significantly elevated in OST recipients, showing the long-term importance of chronic liver disease in this population.

40|$|Background: Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSS) collect {{independent}} mortality {{data that}} could be used for assessing the quality of mortality data in national civil registration (CR) systems in low- and middle-income countries. However, the use of HDSS data for such purposes depends on the quality of record linkage between the two data sources. We describe and evaluate the quality of record linkage between HDSS and CR mortality data in South Africa with HDSS data from Agincourt HDSS. Methods: We applied deterministic and probabilistic record linkage approaches to mortality records from 2006 to 2009 from the Agincourt HDSS and those in the CR system. Quality of the matches generated by the probabilistic approach was evaluated using sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) calculated from a subset of records that were linked using <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> <b>number.</b> Matched and unmatched records from the Agincourt HDSS were compared to identify characteristics associated with successful matching. In addition, the distribution of background characteristics in all deaths that occurred in 2009 and those linked to CR records was compared to assess systematic bias in the resulting record-linked dataset in the latest time period. Results: Deterministic and probabilistic record linkage approaches combined linked a total of 2264 out of 3726 (60. 8 %) mortality records from the Agincourt HDSS to those in the CR system. Probabilistic approaches independently linked 1969 (87. 0 %) of the linked records. In a subset of 708 records that were linked using <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> <b>number,</b> the probabilistic approaches yielded sensitivity of 90. 0 % and PPV of 98. 5 %. Records belonging to more vulnerable people, including poorer persons, young children, and non-South Africans were less likely to be matched. Nevertheless, distribution of most background characteristics was similar between all Agincourt HDSS deaths and those matched to CR records in the latest time period. Conclusion: This study shows that record linkage of mortality data from HDSS and CR systems is possible and can be useful in South Africa. The study identifies predictors for death registration and data items and registration system characteristics {{that could be}} improved to achieve more optimal future matching possibilities...|$|E

40|$|Many {{countries}} require {{health services}} {{to show that}} they are meeting the needs of ethnic minority populations. This requires data on health status, healthcare uptake and outcomes and population denominators. Weaknesses in routine data collection often make such requirements difficult to meet. Routine data sources in Scotland, as in most countries, may not include a patient’s ethnicity. In Scotland, the need for such data is driven by both policy and legislation responding to rapidly increasing ethnic diversity. Fair For All (2003), Scotland’s policy, provides a strategic approach to improve the health of minority ethnic groups. The UK Race Relations (Amendment) Act (2000) placed a duty on public bodies to promote racial equality. These mandates are reflected in guidance on ethnic monitoring. Appropriate service and research is undermined by the lack of data. Ethnic variations occur in all of Scotland’s national health priority areas, including coronary heart disease/stroke, cancer, maternal and child health and mental health. In view of the mismatch between need for and availability of data by ethnic group, Bhopal proposed a demonstration project to explore retrospective approaches. The project tested proposals including name search methods, analyses by country of birth, modelling/extrapolation from other nations’ datasets, and linkage methods. The demonstration project concluded that census health records linkage methods— {{in the context of this}} project first mooted by Povey— held most promise.

Of the 55, 291 notified cases, 45, 250 (81. 8 %) were notified within 7 days of anti-tuberculosis treatment (timely reporting) and 10, 041 (18. 2 %) after 7 days (delayed reporting). Factors significantly associated with failure of notification are younger age, previously notified cases, foreigner, those who visited clinics and those who visited health care facilities only once or twice in 6 months. Conclusion A small proportion of TB cases were not notified and a substantial proportion of notified TB cases had delayed reporting, findings with implication for strengthening surveillance of tuberculosis in Taiwan.

We develop and evaluate a new measure of national attachment that is grounded in social identity theory (Tajfel and Turner 1979), drawing on data from three distinct sources: two studies of undergraduate students and the 1996 General Social Survey (GSS). Confirmatory factor analyses provide clear evidence that <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> is distinct from other measures of national attachment including symbolic, constructive, and uncritical patriotism (and nationalism). <b>National</b> <b>identity</b> has a <b>number</b> of other good measurement properties when compared to existing measures: it receives equal endorsement from conservatives and liberals (unlike most other measures which exhibit an ideological bias), develops with time spent in the United States among immigrants, and most importantly is the only measure of national attachment to predict political interest and voter turnout in both student and adult samples, consistent with the predictions of social identity theory. In that sense, the <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> measure outperforms all other measures of national attachment and provides unambiguous evidence that a strong American identity promotes civic involvement. Research on patriotism has been marred by a con-fusing array of terms, definitions, and expectedconsequences in which patriotism is variously de-fined as a sense of national loyalty, a love of national sym-bols, specific beliefs about a country’s superiority, and as a crucial ingredient in the development of civic ties to a mature nation (Hurwitz and Peffley 1999; Spinner-Halev and Theiss-Morse 2003; Sullivan, Fried, and Dietz 1992).
