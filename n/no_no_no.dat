500|$|By early 2014, {{the lack}} of a clear {{mainstream}} Republican candidate for the 2016 presidential election led some supporters, donors, and pollsters to suggest Romney stage a third run. Regarding such a possibility, Romney at first responded, [...] "Oh, <b>no,</b> <b>no,</b> <b>no.</b> <b>No,</b> <b>no,</b> <b>no,</b> <b>no,</b> <b>no.</b> <b>No,</b> <b>no,</b> no." [...] Nevertheless, speculation continued: the continuing unpopularity of Obama led to buyer's remorse among some voters; the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine made Romney's [...] "No. 1 geopolitical foe" [...] remark look prescient; and an August 2014 poll of Iowan Republicans showed Romney with a large lead there over other potential 2016 candidates. A poll conducted in July 2014 by CNN showed Romney with a 53 to 44 lead over Obama in a hypothetical election [...] "redo." [...] By early 2015, Romney was actively considering the idea and contacting his network of supporters. [...] In doing so he was positioning himself in the invisible primary – the preliminary jockeying for the backing of party leaders, donors, and political operatives – against former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who had already set a likely campaign in motion and would be a rival to Romney for establishment Republican support. Despite support in some quarters for a third bid for the presidency, there was a backlash against him from conservatives who wanted a fresher face without a history of presidential losses, and many of Romney's past donors were not willing to commit to him again. Romney announced on January 30, 2015 that he would not run for president in 2016, saying that while he thought he could win the nomination, [...] "one of our next generation of Republican leaders" [...] would be better positioned to win the general election.|$|E

500|$|... "Sexy! No No No..." [...] is an electropunk song, which {{consists}} of three songs welded together, according to journalist Peter Robinson: one with a samba rhythm, one with a sped-up sample and a breakbeat, and an intro from elsewhere. The track opens with Cole singing over a [...] "spooky" [...] instrumentation. Her vocals have been vocodered and she sings [...] "Cause I've been sitting back, no chance of falling / Hoping that nothing ever blows, no no / Boy, {{did you ever think}} that loving would be / Nothing more than walking me home, no no". As the chorus begins, the song incorporates a sample from Scottish rock band Nazareth's 1975 track [...] "Hair of the Dog", and the group starts singing, [...] "Did you tell him? <b>No</b> <b>no</b> <b>no</b> / Give him kisses? <b>No</b> <b>no</b> <b>no</b> / Whisper honey? <b>No</b> <b>no</b> <b>no</b> / You're delicious? Hell no". John Murphy of musicOMH noted that [...] "Sexy! No No No.." [...] is not [...] "structured like a proper pop song - there's no verse-chorus-verse". The instrumentation of [...] "Sexy! No No No..." [...] is composed of multi-layered guitar riffs and [...] "euphoric woo woo-oo harmonies", while the song's structure follows as introduction, chorus, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, middle eight, verse. A Newsround reviewer described the lyrical content, saying that Girls Aloud are [...] "trying a different approach to getting the guy", in that [...] "instead of being 'sexy', they've backed off." ...|$|E

The song's lyrics are credited to Penn, Bo Diddley and Willie Cobbs, and production was handled by Steely and Clevie. Penn recorded a song in 1967 called [...] "You Don't Love Me", which incorporates elements {{of the music and}} lyrics of Cobbs' 1960 song [...] "You Don't Love Me". The Cobbs song was, in turn, based on Diddley's 1955 song [...] "She's Fine, She's Mine". Thus, both are credited as songwriters on Penn's recording. In 1994, after a 17-year break from the music industry, she re-recorded a dancehall version of the song retitled [...] "You Don't Love Me (No, No, No)".|$|E

500|$|The role of Mopsa was {{originally}} {{performed by a}} soprano; however, a later revision by Purcell stated that {{it was to be}} performed by [...] "Mr. Pate in woman's habit", presumably to have a grotesque effect and highlight the refrain [...] "No, <b>no,</b> <b>no,</b> <b>no,</b> no; no kissing at all" [...] in the dialogue between Corydon and Mopsa. Also, it is not entirely clear what the word [...] "countertenor" [...] means in this context. The record is ambivalent as to whether Purcell (himself a countertenor) used a tenor with a particularly high range (though lighter at the top) and tessitura (known sometimes as a haute-contre, the descendants of the contratenors alti of medieval polyphony) or a falsettist. It seems that throughout his career he used both. [...] However, purely for reasons of dramatic verisimilitude, it is more likely than not that the travesty role of Mopsa was taken by a falsettist, and the presence of a duet for two male altos ("Let the fifes and the clarions") makes it seem more probable that for this work falsettists were employed.|$|E
