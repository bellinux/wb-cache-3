5000|$|Although {{promising}} as {{a sustainable}} and affordable option, {{the success of}} push-pull pest management highly depends on proper implementation {{in combination with other}} good ecological practices. Firstly, not all varieties of Napier grass function as a trap. In a study of eight varieties, only two bana and Ugandan hairless Napier varieties significantly attracted female moths for egg placement over maize. Of these two, only bana significantly decreased survival rates. In a farmer's field, it is recommended that three rows of bana Napier grass be planted as a border crop around the entire field. Potential exists to improve the push-pull strategy through further trials with different intercrops, by manipulating allelochemicals in each intercrop, as well as by investigating insect sensitivity to natural chemicals. Once prominent in a field, it is difficult to rid the area of the stemborer pests as larvae can remain dormant, and therefore push-pull management will not have the intended effect. It is recommended that if an infestation is particularly severe, neither corn, nor sorghum should be planted in the same field the following year but instead rotated with other crops. It is also important to burn infested stalks or, if they have an intended use, to leave them out in the sun for three days. The use of push-pull pest management must be used in combination with good ecological practices to yield the desired results.Finally, the establishment of a push-pull system requires increased labour in the primary stages and a large enough land plot to allow space for a <b>non-food</b> <b>crop</b> to be planted; these factors often deter its adoption. A program could increase adoption rates through promoting its use in combination with livestock, giving economic value to the planting of Napier.More information can be found at http://www.push-pull.net/ as well as specifics for implementation at http://www.push-pull.net/farmers_guide_2012.pdf [...]|$|E

40|$|Traditionally reed {{canary grass}} (Phalaris arundinacea L.) has been {{cultivated}} for forage, but currently is a new <b>non-food</b> <b>crop</b> in northern Europe. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate {{reed canary grass}} germplasm, elite and wild populations, for non-food, forage and seed production. An index composed of different agronomic traits was used to establish the best populations for each end-use. Populations were also ranked according to biomass or seed yield only. Non-food cultivars have not yet been developed, but results from this study suggest that some high biomass forage cultivars could be used in non-food production. However, local populations possessed a desirable combination of traits, including higher proportion of straw associated with high biomass yield. This study indicated that local populations could be used in <b>non-food</b> <b>crop</b> breeding together with elite material. Some evidence for the potential of populations for forage production was also noted, mainly through leaf area and leaf proportion measurements. High non-food or forage indices were associated with good seed production in some populations. Results help in selecting appropriate cultivars for non-food use, which is currently important as the cultivated area of reed canary grass for biofuel in Finland is anticipated to be 75 000 hectares by 2010. ...|$|E

30|$|There is global impetus towards {{development}} of biorefineries that utilise industrial, rural and municipal waste {{for the production}} of bioenergy and marketable bio-based compounds. The biorefinery concept has been identified as a significant opportunity for rural economic development (Charlton et al. [2009]; Leistritz and Hodur [2008]; Sharma et al. [2011]) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) is currently under investigation as a <b>non-food</b> <b>crop</b> that could be processed as feedstock in a rural biorefinery setting (Farrar et al. [2012]). Production of biogas from ryegrass pulp (Kyazze et al. [2008]) and bioethanol from grass juice (Martel et al. [2010]; Martel et al. [2011]) has already been achieved. Microbial biotechnology and metabolic engineering promises to diversify the application of the biorefinery approach for production of novel products and several ‘designer yeast strains’ capable of using polyfructose have been reported (Martel et al. [2011]; Wang et al. [2011]; Zhang et al. [2010]). Nonetheless, yeast species that already have GRAS (generally regarded as safe) status remain readily applicable to biorefinery processes and novel uses for yeast biomass warrant consideration.

Most lawns are simply too big to be useful, with high maintenance costs, minimal wildlife value, low aesthetic interest, and negative environmental impact. Though our obsession with immaculate expanses of grass has been long in the making, it is not too late to change. Why are there so many turf grass lawns? Some people speculate that the American infatuation with mowed lawns stems back to our ancestral beginnings in the savannahs of Africa, where lower grass provided open sight lines to lurking predators. More recently, in the eighteenth century, close-cut lawns became a symbol of wealth in Europe, a practice that made its way across the Atlantic by the 1800 s.

40|$|The {{current work}} aimed to resolve some long-standing {{questions}} about the potential benefits and limitations of co-digestion of slaughterhouse wastes. To achieve this, a laboratory-scale trial was carried out using the mechanically recovered organic fraction of municipal solid waste mixed with either sheep blood or a mixture of pig intestines with flotation fat. Both of these co-substrates are difficult to digest in isolation because of their high nitrogen and lipid concentrations, and are regulated as Category 3 materials under the Animal By-Products Regulations (EC 1069 / 2009). The results showed that at an organic loading rate of 2 kg VS m? 3 day? 1 with the slaughterhouse material making up 20 % of the load on a volatile solids basis the process could operate successfully. As the loading was increased to 4 kg VS m? 3 day? 1 signs of inhibition appeared with both co-substrates, however, and volumetric methane production {{was reduced to a}} point where co-digestion gave no process advantage. The main operational problem encountered was an increase in the concentration of volatile fatty acids in the digestate, particularly propionic acid: this was thought to be a result of ammonia toxicity. The concentration of potentially toxic elements in the digestate made it unsuitable for agricultural application for food production, although the increased nitrogen content made it more valuable as a fertiliser for <b>non-food</b> <b>crop</b> use...|$|E

The work presented here relates to developing a new genre of environmentally-sustainable bio-based antioxidants (AO) for industrial uses that are obtained from extracts of UK-grown rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) plant. The performance of these AOs was tested, and their efficacy compared with some common and benchmark synthetic AOs from the same chemical class, in different products including polymers especially for packaging, as well as lubricants, cosmetics and health products. One of the main active ingredients in rosemary is Rosmarinic acid which is a water-soluble compound. This was chemically transformed into a number of ester derivatives, Rosmarinates, targeted for different applications. The parent and the modified antioxidants (the rosmarinates) were characterised and their antioxidancy were examined and tested in linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) and in polypropylene (PP) and compared with compounds of similar structure and with other well known synthetic antioxidants used commercially in polyolefins.
