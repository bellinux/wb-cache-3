When she learns {{the truth about the}} shagreen and her role in Raphaël's demise, she is horrified. Raphaël cannot control his desire for her and she rushes into an adjoining room to escape him and so save his life. He pounds on the door and declares both his love and his desire to die in her arms. She, meanwhile, is trying to kill herself to free him from his desire. He breaks down the door, they consummate their love in a fiery moment of passion, and he dies.|$|E
5|$|Natives of {{the region}} {{encountered}} foreigners at several times and places during the 18thand 19thcenturies. European and American vessels explored the coastal area around {{the mouth of the}} river in the late 18thcentury, trading with local natives. The contact would prove devastating to the Indian tribes; a large portion of their population was wiped out by a smallpox epidemic. Canadian explorer Alexander Mackenzie crossed what is now interior British Columbia in 1793. From 1805 to 1807, the Lewis and Clark Expedition entered the Oregon Country along the Clearwater and Snake rivers, and encountered numerous small settlements of natives. Their records recount tales of hospitable traders who were not above stealing small items from the visitors. They also noted brass teakettles, a British musket, and other artifacts that had been obtained in trade with coastal tribes. From the earliest contact with westerners, the natives of the mid- and lower Columbia were not tribal, but instead congregated in social units <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> village, and more often at a family level; these units would shift with the season as people moved about, following the salmon catch up and down the river's tributaries.|$|E

25|$|Continuous {{probability}} distributions can {{be described}} in several ways. The probability density function describes the infinitesimal probability of any given value, and the probability that the outcome lies in a given interval can be computed by integrating the probability density function over that interval. On the other hand, the cumulative distribution function describes the probability that the random variable is <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> given value; the probability that the outcome lies in a given interval can be computed by taking the difference between the values of the cumulative distribution function at the endpoints of the interval. The cumulative distribution function is the antiderivative of the probability density function provided that the latter function exists.|$|E

Details of their existence, design, and use were kept secret well into the 1970s. Winston Churchill personally issued an order for their destruction into pieces <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> man's hand, to keep secret that the British were capable of cracking Lorenz SZ cyphers (from German rotor stream cipher machines) during the oncoming cold war.

During this posting Headlam was promoted to flying officer, on 1July 1935, and wrote a paper on national defence in which he suggested that with [...] "strong air forces, naval forces (including submarines), and fixed defences, Australia may be made practically invulnerable". According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens, this paper [...] "in effect, defined the 'anti-lodgment' concept which has been a persistent feature of RAAF strategic thinking".|$|E

Some were large, but one or two--and this is a {{wonderful}} instance of how nature carries out her handiwork by the same unvarying laws, utterly irrespective of size--were tiny. One little nook, for instance, was <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> unusually big doll's house, and yet {{it might have been a}} model for the whole place, for the water dropped, tiny icicles hung, and spar columns were forming in just the same way.|$|R

[...] Also on October 15th, per a handwritten coin return warrant issued by Director Rittenhouse, the 1,758 silver dollars were transferred from the custody of Mint Treasurer Dr. Nicholas Way to David Rittenhouse, as a partial coin return towards his August 22nd silver deposits. The 1,758 coins that were struck by Chief Coiner Henry Voigt, though acceptable, were poorly struck due to issues with the coining press that was used during early production at the Mint.

500|$|Although {{he noted}} that {{his support for the}} majority's opinion was [...] "unqualified", Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{separate}} concurring opinion in which he questioned the propriety of solitary confinement. Justice Kennedy observed that since 1989, Ayala had spent more than twenty five years in solitary confinement. Although the conditions of Ayala's confinement were not established in the record, Justice Kennedy wrote that [...] "it is likely [...] has been held for all or most of the past 20 years or more in a windowless cell <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> typical parking spot for 23 hours a day; and in the one hour when he leaves it, he likely is allowed little or no opportunity for conversation or interaction with anyone". Justice Kennedy wrote that [...] "he human toll wrought by extended terms of isolation long has been understood, and questioned, by writers and commentators" [...] and that solitary confinement [...] "bears a further terror and peculiar mark of infamy". Justice Kennedy conceded that [...] "in some instances temporary, solitary confinement is a useful or necessary means to impose discipline and to protect prison employees and other inmates", but that courts should ultimately determine [...] "whether workable alternative systems for long-term confinement exist, and, if so, whether a correctional system should be required to adopt them".|$|E

50|$|Since {{the artist}} spent, {{according}} to Bellori, {{four or five}} years in Rome doing repetitious devotional images, and copies of portrait heads ‘un grosso l’uno’, it was natural for him to repeat his own inventions when he arrived at this sensational new technique of copying reality, from a virtual image, instead of other people’s compositions. The parabolic mirror, probably the same one that Della Porta had had constructed in Venice in 1580, which had produced some sensational effects and {{led to the development of}} the camera obscura, was probably <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> eye-glass, but it made it possible to make a mosaic of naturalistic images that was extremely compelling; the technique also explains the shallow focus of Caravaggio’s compositions.|$|R

[...] Ralph Budd, accused of gambling on diesel power, chirped that [...] "I knew that the GM people were going to see the program through to the very end. Actually, I wasn't taking a gamble at all." [...] The manifestation of this gamble was the eight-cylinder Winton 8-201A diesel, a creature <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> small Dumpster, that powered the Burlington Zephyr (built 1934) on its record run and opened the door for developing the long line of diesel engines that has powered Electro-Motive locomotives for the past seventy years.|$|E

500|$|We met land crabs, too, {{and were}} sadly disappointed. They were small, <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> {{ordinary}} edible crab, with bloated shells and moderately long pincers. Some were of beetroot purple, others yellow or orange, apparently two colour-phases {{of the same}} species. They were shy, freezing with pincers erect when alarmed, usually to be found within a short distance of their burrows and ready to scuttle down {{at the drop of}} a hat. In rainy weather they promenaded more freely, sometimes appearing at the side of road with arms waving like diminutive but aggressive hitch-hikers. Fringed mandibles [...] suggest a permanently turned-down mouth, giving them a disgruntled, unhappy expression; they were disagreeable rather than sinister and fell far short of their reputation.
