25|$|Also, {{because the}} concept of Internet of things entails adding {{electronics}} to mundane devices (for example, simple light switches), and because the major driver for replacement of electronic components is often technological obsolescence rather than actual failure to function, {{it is reasonable to}} expect that items that previously were kept in service for many decades would see an accelerated replacement cycle if {{they were part of the}} IoT. For example, a traditional house built with 30 light switches and 30 electrical outlets might stand for 50 years, with all those components still original at the end of that period. But a modern house built with the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>switches</b> and outlets set up for IoT might see each switch and outlet replaced at five-year intervals, in order to keep up to date with technological changes.

This article analyzes the impact of different bus transitions on SSN. Transitions involving the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>switching</b> signals, but with different placement <b>of</b> <b>switching</b> wires (different switching patterns) within the bus, can induce considerably different levels of SSN. The authors evaluate how SSN varies as a function <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>switching</b> wires, for different values of wire capacitances.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel switching frequency optimized space vector {{pulse width modulation}} (SVPWM) scheme for cascaded multilevel inverters. The proposed SVPWM is developed in a α′β′ coordinate system, in which the voltage vectors have only integer entries and the absolute increment of coordinate values between adjacent vectors is equal to dc-bus voltage of power cells (1 pu). The new SVPWM scheme is built with three categories <b>of</b> <b>switching</b> paths. During each switching path, the change of one phase voltage is limited in 1 pu. This contributes to decrease the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> commutations <b>of</b> <b>switches.</b> The proposed SVPWM scheme is validated on a 7 -level cascaded inverter and {{the results show that}} it significantly outperforms traditional SVPWM schemes in terms <b>of</b> decreasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>switch</b> commutations...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the role <b>of</b> <b>switching</b> in minimizing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> electronic ports (e. g., SONET ADMs) in an optical network that carries sub-wavelength traffic. Providing nodes {{with the ability}} to switch traffic between wavelengths, such as through the use of SONET cross-connects, can reduce the required <b>number</b> <b>of</b> electronic ports. We show that only small switches at multiple switching nodes are needed for significant reductions in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> ports. We provide a lower bound on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> electronic ports that is a function <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>switching</b> nodes. We show that our lower bound is relatively tight by providing routing and grooming algorithms that nearly achieve the bound. For uniform traffic, we show that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> electronic ports is reduced when the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>switching</b> nodes used is approximately equal to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> wavelengths of traffic generated by each node. Finally, we provide a general upper bound on the amount <b>of</b> <b>switching</b> required in the network. For uniform traffic, our bound shows that as the size of the network increases, each traffic stream must be switched at most once (at one <b>of</b> the <b>switching</b> nodes) in order to achieve the minimum port count. ...|$|R
