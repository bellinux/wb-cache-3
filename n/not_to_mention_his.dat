While Coulson shops for snacks {{in the back of the}} station, two robbers enter and demand the money from the register. When the robbers ask whose car is outside, Coulson reveals himself, {{surrender}}s his keys, and offers to surrender his pistol as well. As he is about to turn over the gun, Coulson distracts the robbers and subdues both men in seconds. He then nonchalantly pays for his snacks while subtly advising the clerk <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> involvement to the police and leaves the station.|$|E

25|$|We are now {{left with}} two sons from Antonio's first {{marriage}} {{who worked in}} the family shop: Omobono and Franceso. As Omobono had left the dwelling aged eighteen in search of new employment possibilities in Naples, he left Antonio to pay for much of his living expenses. In this sense, his father had never really forgiven him for leaving home. Just as Paolo, he would inherit six violins. That was all that was written on the will for him. As For Francesco, who was named his father's successor, he would inherit the rest of his father's belongings, the rest of the estate. This included all of the wood tools, stencils, finished violins, patterns, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention,</b> <b>his</b> father's reputation.|$|E

25|$|The fourth Under-19 World Cup held in New Zealand only {{confirmed}} Australia's {{dominance of}} the game, and from their opening match, when they obliterated Kenya by 430 runs, through to their comprehensive victory over South Africa in the final, they were never threatened. Participating nations included the ten Test-playing nations, plus Canada, Kenya, Namibia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, and Scotland. Their captain, Cameron White, was singled out for praise for his leadership, and he chipped in with 423 runs at 70.50. And they didn't rely on pace either, playing only two seamers and four slow bowlers, with Xavier Doherty, a slow left-armer, leading the wicket-takers with 16 at 9.50 and all without a single wide. In contrast, India, the holders, underperformed in their semi-final against South Africa, a team they had easily beaten {{a week or so}} earlier. They also suffered embarrassing defeats to neighbours Pakistan and Bangladesh. Pakistan, however, provided the main upset when they lost to Nepal by 30 runs, and Nepal also gave England a few uneasy moments. Zimbabwe won the plate competition, with their expected opponents, Bangladesh, beaten in the semi-final by Nepal. Australian Cameron White was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 423 runs at an average of 70.50 and Xavier Doherty was the leading wicket-taker, with 16 wickets at 9.50. Tatenda Taibu, Zimbabwe's captain, was Man of the Series for his 250 runs and 12 wickets, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> wicket-keeping in between bowling stints.|$|E

[...] Despite this, [...] "in a fragile period of the American psyche when the general American public, still stunned by the shock of Pearl Harbor and uncertain what lay ahead in Europe, desperately needed a hero, they wholeheartedly embraced Douglas MacArthur—good press copy that he was.

500|$|Publications such as GQ, Rolling Stone, and People have {{referred}} to Lautner as a sex symbol, with the latter publication calling the actor a future epitome of pop culture. He {{has been called the}} new young adult star that can [...] "both woo the girls with his intensity and impress the boys with his rugged agility." [...] According to Mickey Rapkin of GQ, the use of Lautner's physique in films has been compared to Megan Fox in her work. After his massive physical change following Twilight, Lautner became a tabloid teen idol with his co-stars Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart. Lautner, determined to stay in the series, worked out every day and gained over [...] of muscle in order to bulk up for the role of Jacob Black in the remaining films in The Twilight Saga. Michelle Lanz of MSN Wonderwall said that Lautner's change may have saved his career. Several critics credit Lautner's physical characteristics for much {{of the success of the}} Twilight series, with critic Sharon Waxman stating, [...] "as a tabloid teen idol, he certainly deserves some credit for New Moon's $700 million worldwide gross." [...] Lautner's abs in particular have been subject to media attention, with The Wrap stating that companies bidding for the actor in movies in 2011 would [...] "shell out for the young actor's much-on-display though mostly untried abs." [...] Mickey Rapkin of GQ said, [...] "the film's marketing issues were solved when Lautner's [...] "abdominal muscles became New Moons main talking point, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> calling card."

Both men flourished {{throughout}} the 1950s and 1960s as male icons for those decades, but Ford was frustrated {{that he was not}} given the opportunities to work with directors of the caliber that led Holden to his Oscar-winning [...] career, such as Billy Wilder and David Lean. [...] Glenn Ford missed out on From Here to Eternity– as did Rita Hayworth– when production was stalled by Columbia studio head, Harry Cohn. He also made the mistake, which he bitterly regretted later, of turning down the lead in the brilliant comedy [...] Born Yesterday (also planned with Rita Hayworth) which Holden then snatched up.|$|E

2500|$|The Kinks left RCA Records in 1977, {{switching}} to Arista. The group shed {{all of the}} extra backing vocalists and brass instrumentalists that had accompanied them throughout their theatrical years, and reverted to a five-piece rock group again. Their debut LP for Arista was entitled Sleepwalker, and was a commercial and critical comeback for the group. It was the first album in what critics usually call the [...] "arena rock" [...] phase of the group, in which more commercial and mainstream production techniques would be employed. Dave later commented that {{he was glad to}} be back to more guitar-oriented songs, and he has listed Sleepwalker as one of his favourites. His composition and earnest, almost desperate lead vocals, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> particularly ripping lead guitar sound, led to airplay — especially on college stations — for his idealistic [...] "Trust Your Heart" [...] on the 1978 Misfits album.|$|E
2500|$|As the 19th century gained momentum, Squire's {{enterprises}} did likewise. After the Rum Rebellion in 1808, James {{began work}} as a baker (James had a bakery in Kent Street), and he also often supplied meat to the colony, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> farming duties. He then worked in a credit union style of banking and was widely known for his fair play as a lender and a philanthropist to his poorer neighbours. James was nicknamed the 'Patriarch of Kissing Point'. Colonial artist Joseph Lycett explained: [...] "Had he not been so generous, James Squire {{would have been a}} much wealthier man".Joseph Lycett also stated that James was: [...] "Universally respected for his amiable and useful qualities {{as a member of the}} lower class of settlers... his name will long be pronounced with veneration by the grateful objects of his liberality".Despite his previous convict status, James also became a resident district constable. This was due to the number of trespassers on his property and theft of his belongings. The Sydney Gazette is riddled with articles submitted by James, warning others of trespassers and thefts. For example, in the Sydney Gazette on 3 July 1803 James submitted a notice of a theft of boat.|$|E
2500|$|Zosimus, a Byzantine chronicler writing around AD 500, records an {{invasion}} of Rome's Danubian provinces in 381 by a barbarian coalition of Huns, Scirii and Karpodakai ("Carpo-Dacians"). The latter term has been taken by some scholars as 'proof' of the Carpi's Dacian ethnicity. But {{this is the only}} literary evidence linking the Carpi name to that of the Dacians, and Zosimus is regarded by numerous modern scholars as an unreliable chronicler. One historian accords Zosimus [...] "an unsurpassable claim to be regarded as the worst of all the extant Greek historians of the Roman Empire [...] it would be tedious to catalogue all the instances where this historian has falsely transcribed names, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> confusion of events...". In any case, the term is ambiguous. It has also been interpreted as the [...] "Carpi and the Dacians" [...] or [...] "the Carpi mixed with the Dacians". According to the eminent classical scholar Kahrstedt, the term does not refer to the Carpi at all but to Free Dacians, who occupied the territory of the Carpi, after the latter were deported by the Romans. He argues that, in ancient Greek, {{the first part of the}} term could only have a geographical meaning: i.e. Karpodakai means [...] "the Dacians from the land of the Carpi". In the same vein, it has also been interpreted as [...] "the Dacians of the Carpathians". (Compare Tyragetae, supposedly meaning [...] "the Getae from the Tyras region"). It is possible that the entire Carpi people were transferred to the Roman empire by 318, which is supported by literary and archaeological evidence: Bichir notes that the culture which he calls [...] "Daco-Carpic" [...] ended in about 318. If so, then Zosimus' Karpodakai could not be referring to the Carpi.|$|E
