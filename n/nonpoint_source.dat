40|$|Abstract: Recent draft {{legislation}} proposed in Minnesota would ban {{the use of}} phosphorus in automatic dishwashing detergent (ADWD). During hearings on the {{draft legislation}} there was little information available on the overall loading and relative importance of ADWD {{as a source of}} phosphorus to the state’s surface waters. In response to this lack of information a study was undertaken to determine phosphorus loadings to surface waters from point and <b>nonpoint</b> <b>sources</b> for the 10 major basins in the state and statewide. Phosphorus loads were calculated from existing information sources for low, average and high flow conditions for total and bioavailable phosphorus. Nine source categories for both point and <b>nonpoint</b> <b>sources</b> were considered. Phosphorus loads from point and <b>nonpoint</b> <b>sources</b> were found to vary, both geographically and temporally, in response to annual variations in weather and climate. <b>Nonpoint</b> <b>sources</b> of phosphorus tend to comprise a larger fraction of the aggregate phosphorus load to Minnesota surface waters during relatively wet periods, while point sources are greater during dry conditions. Additionally, sources of phosphorus entering Publicly Owner Wastewater Treatment Systems (POTW) were calculated for nine source categories.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how water quality trading interacts with nonpoint-source abatement-cost sharing (e. g., as currently {{practiced by the}} National Resource Conservation Service through its Environmental Quality Incentives Program [EQIP]) to promote the participation of <b>nonpoint</b> <b>sources</b> in a water quality market, participation that has thus far been noticeably lacking nationwide. As such, an idealized version of water quality trading is envisioned, where water quality trading and nonpoint cost sharing are treated as complementary policy instruments rather than substitutes. Toward this end, the subgame-perfect equilibrium concept is used to model a “multilateral contracting” relationship between the regulatory authority and <b>nonpoint</b> <b>sources</b> when the regulator has incomplete information about the <b>nonpoint</b> <b>sources</b> 2 ̆ 7 production costs.

25|$|Policy {{concerning}} the prevention and reduction of eutrophication {{can be broken}} down into four sectors: Technologies, public participation, economic instruments, and cooperation. The term technology is used loosely, referring to a more widespread use of existing methods rather than an appropriation of new technologies. As mentioned before, nonpoint sources of pollution are the primary contributors to eutrophication, and their effects can be easily minimized through common agricultural practices. Reducing the amount of pollutants that reach a watershed can be achieved through the protection of its forest cover, reducing the amount of erosion leeching into a watershed. Also, through the efficient, controlled use of land using sustainable agricultural practices to minimize land degradation, the amount of soil runoff and nitrogen-based fertilizers reaching a watershed can be reduced. Waste disposal technology constitutes another factor in eutrophication prevention. Because a major contributor to the <b>nonpoint</b> <b>source</b> nutrient loading of water bodies is untreated domestic sewage, it is necessary to provide treatment facilities to highly urbanized areas, particularly those in underdeveloped nations, in which treatment of domestic waste water is a scarcity. The technology to safely and efficiently reuse waste water, both from domestic and industrial sources, should be a primary concern for policy regarding eutrophication.|$|E
25|$|The {{predominant}} {{farm type}} in Devon is livestock farming, which includes dairy, lowland cattle, and sheep farms. In 2006, the {{total labour force}} on Devon farms was 23,240 people, with around 7,953 employed full-time. The majority of land within the biosphere reserve is farmland, which helps support the local economy, but is not designated with statutory protection. The reserve is therefore managed carefully {{with the cooperation of}} farmers and landowners; as the boundaries of the reserve are the catchment areas of the River Taw and River Torridge, extra precaution must be taken in protecting water supplies from <b>nonpoint</b> <b>source</b> pollution. Rainwater can accumulate residues of fertilisers, especially nitrates and phosphates. Once leached into the rivers they can affect the river ecology through eutrophication, causing damage to plants and animals. This {{is one of the most}} pervasive water quality problems in Europe. Pathogens excreted by animals can also directly affect humans when transported by rainwater to rivers and the sea where people swim. Another problem is river sedimentation caused by fine soil particles washing from the land into rivers, this causes high rates of mortality in fish eggs and can affect fish feeding habits. The Biosphere Reserve Partnership provides support to farms that encourage sustainable practices, benefit the environment, and have a good role within the community.|$|E

500|$|The State of Florida {{implemented}} a program named Surface Water Improvement and Management (SWIM) in 1987 {{to assist with}} river cleanups, particularly with <b>nonpoint</b> <b>source</b> pollution, or chemicals that enter the river by soaking into the ground, as opposed to direct piped dumping. SWIM assists local jurisdictions with purchasing land for wetlands restoration. The St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) is charged by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) with restoring the river. The first step in restoration, particularly in the upper basin, is the purchase of public lands bordering the river; ten different reserves and conservation areas have been implemented for such use around the St. Johns headwaters. Around Lake Griffin in the Ocklawaha Chain of Lakes, the SJRWMD has purchased [...] of land that was previously used for muck farming. More than [...] have been purchased along Lake Apopka to restore its wetlands, and the SJRWMD has removed nearly [...] of gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), a fish species that stores phosphorus and adds to algae problems. The SJRWMD has also set minimum levels for the lakes and tributaries in the St. Johns watersheds to monitor permitted water withdrawals and declare water shortages when necessary.|$|E

40|$|Water quality trading, {{particularly}} for nutrients, is increasingly being advocated and proposed by professional economists and regulatory agencies {{as a means}} for achieving pollutant control requirements for point sources under the Clean Water Act. As commonly conceived and designed, agriculture plays an integral role in proposals designed to provide offsite compliance options (often called “offsets ” or “credits”) for regulated point source dischargers. Such “point-nonpoint trading ” has been hailed by federal agencies such as USDA, NRCS, and EPA as a significant new potential source of revenue for agriculture (USDA/EPA 2006; Knight 2003; Conservation Technology Information Center 2006). Yet, the potential of nutrient trading programs to generate revenue for agricultural <b>nonpoint</b> <b>sources</b> is still speculative. Despite more than 10 years of state and federal agency promotion, demonstration projects, and research, the total volume and value of offsets involving regulated point source dischargers and agricultural <b>nonpoint</b> <b>sources</b> is minimal (Stephenson and Shabman 2008). Yet, advocates often assume, and some empirical research supports, the notion that agricultural <b>nonpoint</b> <b>sources</b> will be the favored and most economical (low cost) trading partner for point sources (Faeth 2000; EPA 2004; Ribaudo, Heimlich, and M.
