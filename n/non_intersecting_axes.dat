Oval {{bevel gear}} {{is a kind}} of noncircular bevel gear which can achieve {{variable}} transmission between <b>intersecting</b> <b>axes.</b> We design the pitch curve by spherics cosine theorem in spatial polar coordinate because the pitch curve of oval bevel gear is not the planar curve.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} features of an advanced control system for articulated robots is the capability of transforming the work space coordinates, which naturally characterize any robot task, into the corresponding joint coordinates, on which control actions are developed. For each task, the coordinate transformation problem consists in calculating one trajectory in the joint space which corresponds to the end effector trajectory, usually given in the Cartesian space. While simple kinematical structures allow for closed-form solutions, there is a class of robots for which this is not true. Typical articulated robot structures have three revolute joints at the end effector; the geometric parameters of these joints actually determine the spatial configuration of the last axes of motion. The large majority of today's nonredundant structures have three <b>intersecting</b> <b>axes</b> at the end effector, and closed form solutions do exist in this case. If the <b>axes</b> <b>intersect</b> two-by-two, as in some rather common arm design, an exact solution seems not to exist. A quite different solution algorithm is established, as compared to the trigonometric approach widely adopted so far, which yields solutions in case of two-by-two <b>intersecting</b> <b>axes.</b> The convergence of the algorithm along any trajectory is proved. Effectiveness of the proposed technique can be argued {{by the fact that it}} only makes use of direct kinematics, thus resulting in a contained computational burden. A robot prototype of the kind described above is taken as a reference in order to discuss digital implementation and develop numerical examples...|$|R

In order to analyze the reasonableness of the structural design and test {{the performance of the}} test bed, a three-dimensional solid simulation model of the test bed is set up first with virtual simulation technology to analyze motion characteristics of test-bed and modal analysis to analyze the vibration characteristics of the key components. Simulation test obtains the vibration mode of the test gear box and drive gear box, providing a useful result for the optimization of the test bed. This solves some problems such as that a common test bed cannot test gear with intersecting axis and must have the same test pair gear, and inaccuracies of measuring transmission efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Involute {{helical gears}} mesh {{based on the}} intersections of {{involute}} helicoids. However, spiral involutes on the tooth surface {{do not participate in}} meshing directly. A new type of gear drive, the spiral involute gear drive is proposed that works on contact of spiral involutes. The generation of tooth profile is introduced in detail. Through relative-stagnation method spiral involutes prove to have conjugation characteristics. To testify whether the transmission ratio of cylindrical spiral involute gears is constant, simulation is implemented in commercial codes ADAMS based on solid models of a pair of spiral involute gears. The computed results show that this novel gear drive can achieve a constant transmission ratio. Due to transmission with uniform velocity, cylindrical spiral involute gears can be used in transmission between <b>intersecting</b> <b>axes,</b> so that generating milling and generating grinding can be achieved...|$|R

It explores how differences such as disability, gender, and class are made and unmade in sociotechnical practices. It shows that interactions between enactments of differences are complex, contradictory, unpredictable, and surprising and defy simple con-clusions about effects and politics. These patterns of interference need to be investigated in situated practices, and we have to examine carefully how processes of differentiation interact to support and reinforce but also to chal-lenge and undermine each other...|$|R
