40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the impact of}} various rent increase scenarios on the housing stress situation in Australia and its regions from 2007 - 08 to 2011 - 12. It projects that if rent is increased by 10 % per annum the rate of housing stress would increase from {{the current rate of}} just over 13 per cent to 25 per cent in 2011 - 12, or from over 292, 000 to nearly 566, 000 households. Queensland has the highest rates of housing stress, followed by <b>New</b> <b>South</b> <b>Wale</b> and Victoria. Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia have the lowest rates. Overall, the rates are slightly greater in non-metropolitan than metropolitan areas. Differences in disposable income and rent levels are the main reason for the varying rates between regions. This paper reinforces the conclusions of previous studies of a range of policies to tackle the housing affordability problem, and emphasises the need for a low and stable interest rate regime and regulation of rent levels. It also calls for suitable policies at the State and local level to address the gap in housing stress rates. 31. Introduction...|$|R

40|$|The ballast {{layer is}} {{designed}} to be free draining, but when the voids of the granular medium are wholly or partially filled due to the intrusion of fine particles, the ballast is considered to be “fouled”. In order to ensure acceptable track performance, it is necessary to maintain good drainage within the ballast layer. This paper critically examines the current methods commonly used for evaluating the degree of ballast fouling and, due to their limitations, a new parameter, Void Contaminant Index is introduced. A series of large-scale constant head hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted with different levels of fouling to establish the relationship between the void contamination index and the associated hydraulic conductivity. Subsequently, a numerical analysis was executed to simulate more realistic two-dimensional flow under actual track geometry capturing the drainage capacity of ballast in relation to the void contamination index. In the context of observed test data, the drainage condition of the track could be classified into different categories together with a classification chart capturing the degree of fouling.

40|$|The {{solubility}} and digestion efficiency are two crucial {{factors that}} might affect the identification of integral membrane proteins (IMPs). In our recent work, a novel solvent system, 1 % (v/v) ionic liquids (ILs), 1 -butyl- 3 -methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIM BF 4), dissolved in NH 4 HCO 3 buffer (pH 8. 3), was applied for rat brain proteome analysis. Compared to commonly used SDS and methanol methods, the identified IMPs number from rat brain, analyzed by μRPLC-ESIMS/ MS, was improved by more than 3 times, which {{might be due to}} the good solubilizing ability and biocompatibility of BMIM BF 4 for tryptic digestion. Furthermore, compared to Rapigest and urea methods, with BMIM BF 4 method, the numberof identified IMPs could be improved 25 % and 80 %, respectively, which should be contributed to the good solubilizing ability and high thermal stability of such ILs. All these results demonstrate that BMIM BF 4 method is of advantages for membrane proteome analysis. Such a method was applied for the further analysis of insoluble proteins extracted from rat brain. By 2 D-nano-SCX-RPLC-ESI-MS/MS, in triplicate runs, 2565 nonredundant proteins were identified, and 716 proteins were of at least one predicted transmembrane domain. In addition, through the membrane proteome profiling of human liver microsome, 1830 nonredundant proteins were identified, including 31 CYP enzymes and 16 UGT enzymes. Our experimental results demonstrate that the novel solvent system containing BMIM BF 4 is promising for the large-scale identification of IMPs.
