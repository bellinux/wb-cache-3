5|$|The allies had no 'standing army', <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> any {{requirement}} to form one; {{since they were}} fighting on home territory, they could muster armies as and when required. Different-sized allied forces thus appeared throughout the campaign. These numbers are discussed fully in the article for each battle.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Henry Fairfield Osborn named {{a second}} genus of small {{theropod}} from the Morrison Formation, Ornitholestes. This genus {{was based on}} a partial skeleton from Bone Cabin Quarry, north of Como Bluff. Ornitholestes became intertwined with Coelurus in 1920, when Charles Gilmore, in his influential study of theropod dinosaurs, concluded that the two were synonyms. This was followed in the literature for decades. The two genera were not formally compared, however, <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> a full accounting of what actually belonged to Coelurus, until John Ostrom's study in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Two {{established}} meteor showers {{originate from}} within Corvus' boundaries. German astronomer Cuno Hoffmeister discovered and named the Corvids in 1937, after observing them between June 25 and July 2. They {{have not been}} seen since, <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> evidence of a shower when previous records were examined. Hoffmeister noted the trajectory of the shower {{was similar to that}} of the comet 11P/Tempel–Swift–LINEAR, though this was not confirmed by Zhukov and colleagues in 2011. The shower has been tentatively linked with 4015 Wilson–Harrington. In January 2013, the MO Video Meteor Network published the discovery of the Eta Corvids, assigning some 300 meteors seen between January 20 and 26. Their existence was confirmed by data analysis later that year.|$|E

5|$|For Green Granite, Penney {{proposed}} a design based on radiation implosion and staging. There would be three stages, {{which he called}} Tom, Dick and Harry. Tom, the primary stage, would be a fission bomb. It would produce radiation to implode a secondary, Dick, another fission service. In turn, it would implode Harry, a thermonuclear tertiary. Henceforth, the British designers would refer to Tom, Dick and Harry rather than primary, secondary and tertiary. They still had only vague ideas about how a thermonuclear weapon would work, and whether one, two, or three stages would be required. <b>Nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> much more certainty about the boosted designs, with no agreement on whether the boosting thermonuclear fuel was best placed inside the hollow core, as in Orange Herald, or wrapped around it, as in Green Bamboo. Keith Roberts and John Ward studied the detonation waves in a thermonuclear detonation, {{but there was an}} incomplete understanding of radiation implosion.|$|E
5|$|From his {{extensive}} fieldwork and research experience, Dani refuted any influence of South Indian culture on the Indus Valley Civilization. Using a geographic {{perspective of the}} socio-political systems and cultural distribution of the Indus Basin and surrounding hinterland, he observed that the Indo-Gangetic Plain did not play any {{significant role in the}} development of Indus Valley culture. <b>Nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> any invasion from the seaside during the Bronze Age, although the coastline facilitated maritime trade. The major influence, according to Dani, came from Central Asia in the west. He asserted that the hilly western borderland that appears as a boundary to the external eye is actually a network of hill plateaus where the local people have always moved freely. He therefore argued that the cultural history of Pakistan is more closely related to Central Asia through Buddhist, Persian and later Sufi influences. He strove to revive this relationship by promoting organisations such as the Pak-Central Asia Friendship Association.|$|E
25|$|The Tet Offensive {{was little}} noticed at Con Thien and {{elsewhere}} along the DMZ, rather {{it was just}} the same fighting that {{had been going on for}} the previous weeks and months.

25|$|However, {{just as the}} {{original}} landing site at Helles in April had insufficient space to land all the troops available, and so a secondary landing was to be made north of Gaba Tepe, now in July there was insufficient room to accommodate all the new troops within the congested Anzac perimeter, <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> room to manoeuvre them in battle, and so a new landing at Suvla was planned which would link up with the forces at Anzac.|$|E

25|$|In this environment, Ross led a {{delegation}} to Washington in March 1834 {{to try to}} negotiate alternatives to removal. Ross made several proposals; however, the Cherokee Nation may not have approved any of Ross's plans, <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> reasonable expectation that Jackson would settle for any agreement short of removal. These offers, coupled with the lengthy cross-continental trip, indicated that Ross's strategy was to prolong negotiations on removal indefinitely.

25|$|The EV-1 did {{not include}} a key to unlock and lock the vehicle, though one could be {{provided}} if the driver required one. To unlock or lock the car, you entered a personal identification number (PIN) on a keypad in the driver's side door, similar to that of Ford's Securicode system. Once inside, to start the car, no key was needed, <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> a key slot. In the center console, there was a keypad on which the driver again entered the PIN to start the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} that the fire had started towards {{the rear of the}} plane, in either the lavatory or the luggage area {{at the back of the}} cabin. No items recovered from the front portion of the wreckage showed any evidence of fire damage before the impact, <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> any evidence of fire in the engines or fuel systems. The investigators narrowed the cause down to the firing of some combustible substance, either accidentally by a passenger or crew member or through vibration or some other natural occurrence, or deliberately by bombing.|$|E

The court dismissed {{the claims of the}} last landowners, whose property lay between Water Street and the shore, as being improperly based on unofficial land records and for being based on maps and other documents which did not accurately reflect the physical land.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{continuing}} war with Spain, White was unable to mount another resupply attempt for an additional three years. He finally gained passage on a privateering expedition organised by John Watts and Walter Raleigh. They agreed to stop off at Roanoke {{on the way back}} after raiding the Spanish in the Caribbean. White landed on August 18, 1590, on his granddaughter's third birthday, but found the settlement deserted. His men could not find any trace of the 90 men, 17 women, and 11 children, <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> any sign of a struggle or battle.|$|E

Keys to a car found in Farrell's handbag led to the discovery in Spain of five packages totalling 84kg of Semtex explosive. These packages had four separate detonators attached. Around this was packed 200 rounds of ammunition as shrapnel. There were two timers, marked 10 hrs 45 mins and 11 hrs 15 mins respectively, but they were not primed or connected.|$|E

25|$|The {{film was}} shot in Almeria, Spain in {{widescreen}} on locations built for the Westerns made by Sergio Leone. Its production was particularly traumatic for cast and crew. Whity, a mixture of Euro-western and American South melodrama, was badly received by the critics and became Fassbinder's biggest flop. The film was neither picked up for theatrical release <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> interest for broadcasting it on television. As a result, Whity was only seen as its premiere. It remained unavailable until the 1990s when it began to be screened and now, like almost all of Fassbinder's films, is available on DVD.|$|E
25|$|Authorities {{reviewed}} the recordings {{made by the}} Flight Data Recorder In August 2010, {{it was reported that}} preliminary investigations were complete. There was no evidence of any technical problems <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> any fuel shortage. No technical or medical problems had been reported by the crew and they had not requested any assistance. Due to the 2011 Libyan civil war, the investigation was being hampered, with the Nederlandse Omroep Stichting unable to get any response from the LYCAA. The data from the Cockpit Voice Recorder and Flight Data Recorder had been extracted, and the results given to the LYCAA.|$|E
