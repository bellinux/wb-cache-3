40|$|A {{necessary}} condition for {{the validity of the}} linear viscoelastic model for a (passive) polymeric cylinder with an ultrasonic hysteresis-type absorption submerged in a <b>non-viscous</b> <b>fluid</b> requires that the absorption efficiency is positive (Qabs > 0) satisfying the law of the conservation of energy. This condition imposes restrictions on the values attributed to the normalized absorption coefficients for the compressional and shear-wave wavenumbers for each partial-wave mode n. The forbidden values produce negative axial radiation force, absorption and extinction efficiencies, as well as an enhancement of the scattering efficiency, not in agreement with the conservation of energy law. Numerical results for the radiation force, extinction, absorption and scattering efficiencies are performed for three viscoelastic (VE) polymer cylinders immersed in a non-viscous host liquid (i. e. water) with particular emphasis on the shear-wave absorption coefficient of the cylinder, the dimensionless size parameter and the partial-wave mode number n. Mathematical constraints are established for the non-dimensional absorption coefficients of the longitudinal and shear waves for a cylinder (i. e. 2 D case) and a sphere (i. e. 3 D case) in terms of the sound velocities in the VE material.

We make use of the mathematical formulation of <b>non-viscous</b> <b>fluids</b> describing their physical properties.

A brief introduction to the study of fractal geometry with several examples of well-known fractals is included. An important property of fractals is their non-integral dimension. Several methods of determining the dimension of a curve are described in this paper. Our wave equation is examined under different assumptions representing the conditions of a surface water wave near its breaking point. Solutions are developed using analytical and numerical methods. We determine the dimension of 'rough' solutions using one of the methods introduced and conclude that under certain conditions, surface water waves near their breaking point exhibit a fractal structure on a microscopic scale...|$|R
