40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Numerous {{investigations}} {{have been made}} on the contribution of butter cultures to the flavor of cultured cream butter, but production of uniform cultured cream butter has not been possible in industry. Therefore, it was desirable to investigate in detail the qualitative and quantitative chemistry of the flavor of high quality butter cultures, and to examine more closely some of the aspects of flavor production by butter culture organisms. Volatile flavor components of high quality butter culture and control heated milk were isolated from intact samples {{by means of a}} specially designed low-temperature, reduced-pressure steam distillation apparatus. Most of the flavor compounds present in the resulting distillate fractions were tentatively identified by gas chromatographic relative retention time data. Flavor concentrates obtained by ethyl ether extractions of aqueous distillates were also separated by temperature-programmed, capillary column gas chromatography, and the effluent from the capillary column was analyzed by a fast- scan mass spectrometer. Many of the flavor compounds in the flavor concentrates were positively identified by correlation of mass spectral and gas chromatographic data. In addition, supporting evidence for the identification of some flavor components was obtained through the use of qualitative functional group reagents, derivatives and headspace gas chromatography. Compounds that were positively identified in butter culture include ethanol, acetone, ethyl formate, methyl acetate, acetaldehyde, diacetyl, ethyl acetate, dimethyl sulfide, butanone, 2 -butanol, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, methane, methyl chloride, carbon dioxide and methanol; also included were 2 -pentanone, 2 -heptanone, acetoin, formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, methyl hexanoate, ethyl hexanoate, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, methyl octanoate and ethyl octanoate. Compounds that were tentatively identified in butter culture include hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, n-butanal, n-butanol, 2 -hexanone, n-pentanal, n-pentanol, 2 -mercaptoethanol, n-butyl formate, n-butyl acetate, 2 -methylbutanal, 3 -methylbutanal, methylpropanal, methyl heptanoate, n-octanal, 2 -tridecanone, methyl benzoate, methyl nonanoate, ethyl nonanoate, ethyl decanoate, methyl dodecanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, delta-octalactone and delta-decalactone. Compounds that were positively identified in control heated milk include acetaldehyde, ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, 2 -heptanone, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, ethyl octanoate and methyl decanoate. Compounds that were tentatively identified in control heated milk include dimethyl sulfide, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methyl mercaptan, methyl acetate, acetone, methanol, butanone, butanal, n-butanol, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, 2 -pentanone, 2 -hexanone, 2 -mercaptoethanol, 2 -furfuryl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, methyl heptanoate, 2 -tridecanone, ethyl decanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, delta-octalactone and delta-decalactone. The data indicated that the qualitative flavor composition of control heated milk and butter culture were very similar. Diacetyl, ethanol, 2 -butanol and acetic acid were noted to be consistently absent in the data for the control heated milk. Other compounds were not observed in the heated milk fractions, but were also absent from some of the culture fractions. This was attributed to their presence in low concentrations, chemical instability or inefficient recovery. A modified 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolone hydrazone spectrophotometric procedure was adapted for the determination of acetaldehyde produced in lactic starter cultures. The procedure was applied in conjunction with diacetyl measurements in studying single- and mixed-strain lactic cultures. The diacetyl to acetaldehyde ratio was found to be approximately 4 : 1 in desirably flavored mixed-strain butter cultures. When the ratio of the two compounds was lower than 3 : 1 a green flavor was observed. Acetaldehyde utilization at 21 °C by Leuconostoc citrovorum 91404 was very rapid in both acidified (pH 4. 5) and non-acidified (pH 6. 5) milk cultures. The addition of five p. p. m. of acetaldehyde to non-acidified milk media prior to inoculation greatly enhanced growth of L. citrovorum 91404 during incubation at 21 °C. Combinations of single-strain organisms demonstrated that the green flavor defect can result from excess numbers of Streptococcus lactis or Streptococcus diacetilactis in relation to the L. citrovorum population. Diacetyl, dimethyl sulfide, acetaldehyde, acetic acid and carbon dioxide were found to be "key" compounds in <b>natural</b> <b>butter</b> culture flavor. Optimum levels of these compounds in butter culture were ascertained by chemical or flavor panel evaluations. On the basis of these determinations, a synthetic butter culture prepared with heated whole milk and delta-gluconolactone (final pH 4. 65) was flavored with 2. 0 p. p. m. of diacetyl, 0. 5 p. p. m. of acetaldehyde, 1250 p. p. m. of acetic acid, 25. 0 p. p. b. of dimethyl sulfide and a small amount of sodium bicarbonate for production of carbon dioxide. The resulting synthetic butter culture exhibited the typical aroma, flavor and body characteristics found in natural high quality butter cultures, except that the delta-gluconolactone was found to contribute an astringent flavor...|$|E

2500|$|New {{processes}} that sped {{the production of}} chocolate emerged early in the Industrial Revolution. In 1815, Dutch chemist Coenraad van Houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate, which reduced its bitterness. A few years thereafter, in 1828, he created a press to remove about half the <b>natural</b> fat (cocoa <b>butter</b> or cacao butter) from chocolate liquor, which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality.

Milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the mid-17th century, but in 1875 Daniel Peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by Henri Nestlé with the liquor. In 1879, the texture and taste of chocolate was further improved when Rudolphe Lindt invented the conching machine.|$|R

40|$|Vertical {{graphene}} nanosheets (VGNS) hold great promise for high-performance supercapacitors owing to their excellent electrical transport property, {{large surface area}} and in particular, an inherent three-dimensional, open network structure. However, it remains challenging to materialise the VGNS-based supercapacitors due to their poor specific capacitance, high temperature processing, poor binding to electrode support materials, uncontrollable microstructure, and non-cost effective way of fabrication. Here we use a single-step, fast, scalable, and environmentally-benign plasma-enabled method to fabricate VGNS using cheap and spreadable <b>natural</b> fatty precursor <b>butter,</b> and demonstrate the controllability over the degree of graphitization and the density of VGNS edge planes. Our VGNS employed as binder-free supercapacitor electrodes exhibit high specific capacitance up to 230 F g− 1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s− 1 and > 99 % capacitance retention after 1, 500 charge-discharge cycles at a high current density, when the optimum combination of graphitic structure and edge plane effects is utilised. The energy storage performance can be further enhanced by forming stable hybrid MnO 2 /VGNS nano-architectures which synergistically combine the advantages from both VGNS and MnO 2. This deterministic and plasma-unique way of fabricating VGNS may open {{a new avenue for}} producing functional nanomaterials for advanced energy storage devices...|$|R
40|$|The mango fruit {{not only}} has {{wonderful}} taste, flavor and nutritional values but also has anticancer and anti-viral activities. It is therefore, very popular and is recognized as king of the fruits. Mango fruit {{is also one of}} the cash crops of Pakistan that stands at 5 th position among the main mango producing countries. However, its pre and postharvest wastage is quiet high due to short shelf life and vulnerable to various microorganism. Therefore, the objective of this work was to prolong the shelf life and to improve the quality of the fruit by applying various strategies. For the purpose two commercial varieties of mango namely, Langra and Samar Bahisht Chaunsa were selected for the study. The impact of controlled atmosphere ripening was explored by harvesting the fruit at hard green stage and stored at 20, 30 and 40 â€žaC till ripening. The results obtained for various quality parameters (QP) as well as shelf life of the fruit were compared with the fruit ripened at the tree (under normal conditions). It was observed that the tree ripened fruit was better in quality than the fruit ripened at different storage temperature after harvesting. The fruit took longer time for its ripening at the tree compared to storage at 30 and 40 â€žaC, irrespective of the variety. The shelf life was longest for the mangoes stored at 20 â€žaC compared to others, including tree ripened fruit. However, the waste percent was highest at tree ripened fruit as compared to stored fruit, irrespective of temperature and variety. These parameters were significantly different in most of the cases under the limit P < 0. 05. The results obtained for various quality parameters of the fruit harvested at hard green stage of maturity from different (orientation) side of the tree East, West, North and South showed that the quality was best and waste percent was lowest for the fruit harvested from south (sun exposure time for the fruit was maximum) orientation of tree; the shelf life was longer and weight loss percent was lower for North direction compared to others, irrespective of the variety and storage temperature. The values of QP for the fruit harvested from South were significantly different from other treatments in most of the cases under the limit P < 0. 05. The fruit was harvested three (6. 30 am, 1. 30 pm and 8. 30 pm) times a day and was stored at 20, 30 and 40 â€žaC till ripening. It was concluded that the quality of the ripened fruit was highest for 8. 30 pm harvest time and stored at 40 â€žaC. The fruit harvested at 6. 30 am and stored at 20 â€žaC had lowest quality and weight loss but longest shelf life, whereas the fruit harvested at 1. 30 pm and stored at 40 â€žaC had shortest shelf life and highest weight loss, irrespective of the variety. On the other hand, the waste percent was highest for fruit harvested at 1. 30 pm and 20 â€žaC storage temperature and lowest for 6. 30 am harvest time and stored at 30 â€žaC, irrespective of the variety. However, the quality and the shelf life were improved by coating the fruit with calcium chloride, respective of harvest time plus storage temperature and irrespective of the variety. The impact of harvest stages and storage conditions over the postharvest quality and shelf life of mango fruit was explored by measuring the QP for the fruit harvested at 80 (early stage), 95 (mid stage) and 110 (late stage) days after the fruit setting and stored at three different storage temperature showed a significant impact over the quality characteristics. The waste percentage, weight loss, pH, total soluble solids, carotenoids and total sugar were increased with the storage time/ ripening process, irrespective of maturity stages; while the percentage of acidity and vitamin-C was decreased with storage time. The total sugar contents were highest in later stage whereas, vitamin C and acidity were highest in fruit harvested at early stage whereas; the waste percentage was lowest for mid stage harvest. The weight loss was higher and shelf life was longer for early stage harvest. The ripening rate increased and the shelf life decreased with rise in storage temperature. The total soluble solids, sugar contents and carotenoids had positive correlation with the skin color, irrespective of stage, variety and temperature. The contribution of cooling of the fruit towards the enhancement of quality and prolonging the shelf life was explored by harvesting the fruit at hard green stage of maturity and maintaining at 15 Â¡Â³C (by keeping in cold water and/ or in cold air) for different time periods. The fruit was then stored at 20, 30 and 40 oC till ripening. The quality parameters obtained were correlated with pre-storage cooling treatment. It was concluded that the impact of heat removed of the fruit was significantly different in most of the cases under the limit of P Æ’Â¬ 0. 05. It was also observed that the removal of heat from the fruit enhanced the quality, prolongs shelf life and minimize wastage, irrespective of the variety and storage temperatures. The quality of mango fruit was investigated as related with pedicle (stalk) lengths of the fruit. The fruit was harvested at hard green stage of maturity with 0. 5, 2. 5, 4. 5 and 6. 5 cm pedicle (stalk) lengths and stored at 30 Â¡Â³C till ripening. The result showed that the fruit harvested with 4. 5 cm stalk length was better among the investigated treatment for quality and shelf life. The weight loss and waste percent during ripening process of mango fruit was higher for 0. 5 cm stalks and lower for 4. 5 cm stalk, irrespective of the variety and storage temperature. The impact of coating over the quality and shelf life of mango (Langra and Samar Bahisht Chaunsa) fruit was investigated in detail. For this purpose, several coating materials like starch, olive oil, beeswax, sodium benzoate, coconut oil, <b>natural</b> ghee (clarified <b>butter)</b> and potassium metabisulphite were evaluated. The fruit was harvested at hard green stage of maturity, coated and stored at various temperatures with control till ripening. The data showed that the coating had significant impact over the quality and shelf life of the fruit in most of the cases under the limit of P Æ’Â¬ 0. 05. Shelf life was longest with minimum weight loss and waste percent in <b>natural</b> ghee (clarified <b>butter)</b> and beeswax. Quality was higher in case of natural ghee and starch based coating than others, irrespective of the variety and storage temperature. Overall the shelf life was longest and waste percent was lowest in Samar Bahisht Chaunsa as compared to Langra mango variety, irrespective of the treatment...|$|R
