Aufgrund seiner kationischen quartären Ammoniumgruppen (QAG) interagiert das Polymer mit einfachen Anionen und mit anionischen Arzneistoffmolekülen. Die Wechselwirkungen zwischen den Anionen und den QAG des Polymers beeinflussen die Permeabilität von Eudragit RS-Überzügen, was zur Steuerung der Wirkstofffreisetzung genutzt werden kann. Der Einfluss einwertiger Anionen (<b>Nitrat,</b> Acetat, Monosuccinat) und zweiwertiger Anionen (Sulfat, Disuccinat) auf die Theophyllinfreisetzung aus Eudragit RS-überzogenen Mikrotabletten wird untersucht. Desweiteren wird die Kinetik der Verarmung isolierter Eudragit RS-Filme an Weichmacher (Triethylcitrat, TEC) und Netzmittel (Tween 80) in Abhängigkeit der Anionen im Medium bestimmt. Anionen steuern die Permeabilität durch ihre Affinität zu den QAG des Polymers, welche durch die Coulombkraft Fc gegeben ist.

The {{order of the}} {{measured}} zeta potentials {{as a function of}} the anion species was identical to the order of the permeability enhancing effect of the anion species. The knowledge about the anion induced effects on the permeability was used to design isolated anion modified Eudragit RS membranes. Nitrate, sulphate or acetate ions were added to the polymer dispersion before the film formation process. The stronger the attraction force of the anion specie towards the QAG, the more the polymer permeability was decreased. The effects of the nitrate concentration within the membrane and the polymer level were quantified using a 22 Central Composite Design. In a last investigation the effect of chloride, nitrate and sulphate ions within the Eudragit RS membrane on the pulsatile drug release pattern of sodium acetate containing theophylline pellets was investigated. The pellets displayed a sigmoidal release profile. Their lag time was controlled by the polymer level and the anion species within the Eudragit RS membrane. The higher the attraction force of the anion specie added to the polymer membrane the higher the lag time of the sigmoidal drug release from the pellets (tlag: chloride < nitrate < sulphate). Increasing the polymer level extended the lag time...|$|E

We propose to solve the problem by addition of seaweeds, Sargsasum plagyophyllum and Gracilaria verrucosa to reduce ammonia, nitrite and nitrate. The aim of this research is to evaluate the effectivity of Sargassum and Gracilaria in reducing ammonia, nitrite and nitrate content in the water. This research was conducted in brackish water shrimp pond, using 1 m x 1 m x 1. 2 m plastic enclosures as models. Plastic enclosures without seaweeds were served as controls. All treatments were repeated 4 times. We observed the reduction of ammonia, nitrite and nitrate content weekly. Results indicated that both sargassum and Gracilaria were capable in reducing this inorganic nitrogen content. However, Gracilaria was more effective in the role of ammonia, nitrite and <b>nitrat</b> reduction compared to Sargassum...|$|E

An investigation of the stabil-ity of the enzyme in a series of different salt solutions revealed marked effects of different univalent cation species and of different species of anions. A strong positive correlation was shown between the capacity of univalent cations to protect against inactivation of the enzyme and to activate pyruvate kinase. In addition, potassium, an activator cation, restored to a considerable extent enzyme activity that was lost due to incubation of the enzyme in solutions of the non-activator cations, lithium and Tris. The enzyme consistently showed more stability in buffer solutions containing multivalent anions such as pyrophosphate, sulfate, phosphate and arsenate than in buffer solutions containing the univalent anions acetate, bromide, <b>nitrat...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{destruction}} of cellulose by microbic life has attracted the atten-tion {{of workers in}} this field for many years. Cellulose is found in vari-ous forms of purity in nature. In its natural form, it is extremely resistant to most chemical and biological action. This fact has made this field of research a difficult one to study and has centered the atten-tion of bacteriologists on methods of attack. Because of the com-mercial importance of the anaerobic fermentations, much more {{work has been done}} along these lines. This paper deals with the development and growth of crude cultures of cellulose-fermenting organisms from many different sources.

40|$|An einer rieselfeldbürtigen Altlast werden Ausbreitungs- und Abbaumechanismen von Ammonium basierend auf hydrogeochemischen Parametern und stabilen Isotopen identifiziert und modelliert. Da das Rieselfeld seit fast 20 Jahren geschlossen ist, können auch die Dekontaminationsprozesse untersucht werden. Die Ammoniumausbreitung wird durch Kationenaustausch gesteuert, der durch Eintrag und Akkumulation von abwasserbürtigem organischem Material (OM) zusätzlich erhöht ist. Die stabilen Isotope von Ammonium und <b>Nitrat</b> zeigen vollständigen Abbau des reaktiv verfügbaren Ammoniums durch Nitrifikation in der aeroben Zone direkt an der Schadstoffquelle an. Das entstehende <b>Nitrat</b> wird abstromig durch {{heterotrophe}} Denitrifikation abgebaut. Wie die reaktive Stofftransportmodellierung zeigt, sind die am oberen Rand der Fahne im Abstrom des Rieselfeldes auftretenden erhöhten delta 15 N-Signaturen von Ammonium entweder auf dortige Nitrifikation oder Anammox nahe der Schadstoffquelle zurückzuführen. Das akkumulierte OM liefert durch seine Austauschwirksamkeit zusätzliches Ammonium während der Dekontaminationsphase. Andererseits ermöglicht eingelöstes DOC die Entfernung des sekundären Nitrats durch heterotrophe Denitrifikation. Sollte OM aufgebraucht werden, besteht die Gefahr der Ausbreitung von <b>Nitrat.</b> Sollte innerhalb der Ammoniumfahne Sulfidminerale akkumuliert worden sein, bestünde dann die Gefahr erhöhter Sulfatfrachten durch autotrophe Denitrifikation. Es kann gezeigt werden, dass mit einem reaktiven Multikomponenten-Transportmodell das Langzeitverhalten von Ammonium im Feldmaßstab besser simuliert werden kann als mit einem auf Sorptionsisothermen (Henry, Freundlich) beruhenden Transportmodell. Prognosesimulationen liefern einen deutlich längeren Dekontaminationszeitraum bei Verwendung des reaktiven Modells. Die Anwendbarkeit der Sorptionsisothermen im Feldmaßstab ist deshalb, vor allem bei der Ermittlung von Dekontaminationszeiträumen, grundsätzlich in Frage zu stellen. Using {{the example}} of a contaminant site caused by sewage farm operation ammonium fate and attenuation are identified and modelled based upon hydrogeochemical parameters and stable isotopes. A feature of the site is the chance to investigate the decontamination processes in a contaminant source, which was closed 20 years ago. The ammonium plume migration is controlled by cation exchange, which is increased due to infiltration and accumulation of sewage based organic matter (OM). Complete nitrification of available, i. e. desorbed, ammonium in the aerobic zone directly below the sewage farm is detectable based upon stable isotopes of ammonium and nitrate. The secondary nitrate is degraded downstream the contamination source by heterotrophic denitrification. It is shown by reactive contaminant transport modelling, that increased delta 15 N signatures at the upper fringe of the plume downstream of the source are caused by nitrification on site or by Anammox close to the contaminant source. The exchange affecting accumulated OM cause a release of additional ammonium. On the other hand DOC dissolved from OM facilitates degradation of secondary nitrate due to heterotrophic denitrification. In the case of depleted OM the risk of nitrate migration is arising. In the case of accumulated sulphide minerals which are precipitated due to redox processes during the sewage water infiltration, there may be a risk of increased sulphate loads due to autotrophic denitrification. It can be shown that a reactive multicomponent transport model is better suited to simulate the long term migration of ammonium in field scale than a transport model based on sorption isotherms (Henry, Freundlich). With regard to the aquifer decontamination the application of the reactive transport model yields a longer future decontamination period than the simple retardation model. Hence the applicability of sorption isotherms in field scale is doubtful, especially for investigations of aquifer decontamination...|$|E

Smouldering is flameless, heterogeneous combustion which occurs when oxygen reacts with {{the surface of a}} solid fuel. Understanding the conditions which will result in the ignition and smouldering of a porous fuel is important and the phenomena involved are complex and coupled, involving heat and mass transfer, and chemical kinetics. This thesis reports experimental studies of the ignition, spread, suppression and emissions from reactions in porous media. Similar experimental techniques are shown in this thesis to be applicable when studying a wide range of solids which undergo self-sustaining reactions. This thesis is presented in a manuscript style. Each chapter takes the form of an independent paper which has been prepared for journal publication and as such, each chapter can stand on its own as a piece of research. A final chapter summarizes the findings and conclusions and suggests further areas of research. Chapter 1 presents a study of self-sustaining decomposition of ammonium <b>nitrat...</b>|$|E
