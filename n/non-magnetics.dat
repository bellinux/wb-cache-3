Our paper for the first time proposes the method of purposeful direct transformation of the most important substance physical properties, such as electrical, magnetic, optical and others by controllable modification of solid state atomic constitution. The basis of the new technology is discovered by us effect of selective atom removing out of thin di- and polyatomic films by beams of accelerated particles. Potentials of that technique have been investigated and confirmed by our numerous experiments. It has been shown, particularly, that selective atom removing allows to transform in a controllable way insulators into metals, <b>non-magnetics</b> into magnetics, to change radically optical features and some other properties of materials. The opportunity to remove selectively atoms of a certain sort out of solid state compounds is, as such, of great interest in creating technology associated primarily with needs of nanoelectronics as well as many other "nano-problems" of XXI century.

40|$|Abstract – Lag is {{a general}} term applied to coarse grained (> 2 mm), hard, but {{partially}} weathered rock fragments, which are concentrated at the surface through attrition of finer materials. Based on morphology, mineralogy and the origin of lag from the Cobar region of Australia, lag may be conveniently grouped into three broad morpho-mineralogical categories; (a) those with a rough, blocky, lithic morphology where fabrics of the parent rock are partially preserved and which evolved predominantly in erosional landforms, (b) a smoother pisoid lag, with a well-developed varnish or polished surface, which is most abundant in deeply weathered, erosional and depositional landforms, and (c) a detrital lag evolving {{in a range of}} situations and which is generally more abundant in Quaternary modern drainage landforms. Based on chemistry and magnetic character, two distinct types of magnetic and non-magnetic lag are readily recognised. The magnetic type may include both pisoid and occasionally lithic and ferrolithic pregnant with maghemite. Analysis for various trace elements indicates a drastic difference in their chemistry and anomaly detection ability. Magnetic lags contain anomalous Fe, Pb and other heavy metals, while lithics were enriched Cu, Zn and Mn. Spatially, magnetic lag have broader distribution compared to the lithic fraction, which is concentrated close to its original source. These unique characters of lag, revealing weak anomalies in covered surfaces and its abundance in relation to the erosional and depositional landforms, make them a preferred sampling media in geochemical exploration. The chemical data suggest that the magnetic lag fraction is more useful in reconnaissance exploration, and <b>non-magnetics</b> for follow-up work to locate mineralisation, which may justify partitioning a lag sample prior to analysis...|$|E
40|$|During the low optical {{brightness}} {{states of}} AM Herculis systems (polars) when accretion {{has declined to}} a very low value, the underlying magnetic white dwarf photosphere can be modelled without the complication of thermal bremstrahlung and cyclotron emission from the luminous accretion column. The far ultraviolet spectra can be modelled with high gravity solar composition photospheres. In this way, I present new temperatures and the first chemical abundance estimates for the white dwarfs in three selected polars from the IUE NEWSIPS archive. For the white dwarf in V 834 Cen with Teff = 16, 000 $K, Si/H = 0. 1 solar, C/H = 0. 5 solar, for BY Cam, Teff = 17, 000 K, Si/H = 0. 1, C/H = 5 solar and for RX J 1313 - 32, Teff = 22, 000 K, Si/H = 0. 1 solar, C/H = 0. 1 solar. The temperature distribution of 24 white dwarfs in polars with known temperatures {{above and below the}} period gap is compared with the distribution of the white dwarf temperatures in dwarf novae during quiescence. In both cases, the magnetic white dwarfs in polars are significantly cooler than the <b>non-magnetics.</b> For all CV white dwarfs, magnetic and non-magnetic with Teff < 12, 500 K, 91 % of the objects (10 out of 11) are magnetics in polars. This suggests that long term accretion heating and cooling of white dwarfs in polars differs from the effects of long term accretion in non-magnetic disk accretors.

40|$|Smålands Taberg's Fe-Ti {{occurence}} {{is situated}} ca 10 km south of Jönköping {{in the city}} of Taberg, Jönköping county, southern Sweden. It is a peculiar deposit both geographical and geological, it forms a massive body which rises 140 m above the surrounding terrain as a massive mountain. The mountain consists of titanomagnetite-olivinite and contains titanium, iron and olivine. The occurence is situated in the geological protogine zone and is assumed to be an early crystallisation product of a basaltic magma which intruded the surrounding rock for 1. 2 billion years ago. This works purpose was to investigate the mineralogical composition of the occurence towards the depth and to enrich the ore into three different fractions: 1) one Fe-rich, Ti-olivine poor concentrate, 2) one Ti-rich, Fe-olivine poor concentrate and 3) one olivine, Ti-Fe poor concentrate. The samples were collected from the surface and from a uniqe drillhole prooving that the ore continues from 240 m revealing an utterly homogeneous mineralogical composition with 20 - 35 % anhedral titanomagnetite and 30 - 45 % subhedral grains of olivine in almost every examined sample. Other common minerals in the studied samples are euhedral to subhedral labradorite, pargasite forming coronas around labradorite and serpentine replacing olivine in so called marsh structure. Locally subhedral grains of apatite appear in the larger serpentine fissures. Lamellae of both ilmenite and hercynite are common and present in all observed grains of titanomagnetite. Seldom is the cloth like texture of ulvöspinel found in the titanomagnetite. The sulphides pyrrhotite, pyrite, chalcopyrite and pentlandite are observed as small grains in most of the samples. Detailed studies in a scanning electron microprobe confirmes the homogeneous composition towards depth with an average iron content of 70 %, titanium of 4 % and vanadium of 0, 7 % in the titanomagnetite. A peculiar discovery regarding the mineralogy is the platinum content of up to 3 % in grains of apatite. For an assesment of the beneficiation properties the grain sizes of the identified minerals were measured showing a homogeneous size distribution towards depth. Grain sizes of the minerals present showed that titanomagnetite varies between 50 – 800 µm and lamellae of ilmenite between 0, 1 – 10 µm. Grains of olivine is generally larger, between 50 – 1100 µm while the euhedral labradorite accounted for the largest mineral present with sizes between 100 µm – 1, 5 cm. The few grains of sulphides present is small, sizing between 10 – 45 µm. Three LIMS beneficiation tests were performed on the ore, ground to 95 % < 63 µm. The ore and the two products were analysed in the SEM containing the following: Ground ore with 32, 13 % Fe, 5, 41 % Ti and 0, 31 % V. Magnetic concentrate with 56, 8 % Fe, 10, 15 % Ti and 0, 6 % V, yielding 60, 38 % Fe, 64, 11 % Ti and 66, 11 % V and <b>non-magnetics</b> with 23, 61 % Fe, 2, 79 % Ti and 0, 09 % V. 13 HGMS tests were performed on the non-magnetic fraction from the LIMS test with the purpose to enrich ilmenite. Ti-grades between 3, 53 % to 5, 73 % with yields of 64, 26 % and 96, 59 % respectively were achieved. Due to the magnetic properties of olivine the Ti-grades in the magnetic fraction were unsatisfactory. The contents and yields for Ti indicates that full liberation is not achieved and that another grinding step or beneficiation strategy is necessary for better yields. The purpose of the work was not entirely achieved, although it proved that a Fe-Ti-V-rich, olivine poor fraction can be created after a LIMS enrichement.
