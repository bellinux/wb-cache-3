40|$|The {{theme of}} {{the sudden death of}} a rich person exists in the Old Testament, rabbinical writings, and extra biblical sources. Jesus 2 ̆ 7 parable in Lk 12, 13 — 21 is not a new {{variation}} of the old theme, but an original thought expressed by means of well known material. This thought has its foundation {{in the life of the}} historical Jesus who proclaimed and witnessed to non-dependence on material goods. By sharing meals with the rich, Jesus showed that they needed God 2 ̆ 7 s mercy as well, and by sharing his material instability with the poor Jesus demonstrated that a lasting security could be granted only by God. One of the themes of Luke 2 ̆ 7 s theology is Jesus 2 ̆ 7 concern for the poor and his warnings of the dangers of depending upon material possessions. This is evident from Luke 2 ̆ 7 s formulation of the beatitudes (6, 20 — 26), and from Luke 2 ̆ 7 s own narrative, such as the parable of the Rich man and Lazarus (16, 19 — 31). Lk 12, 13 — 15 is an apophthegma which illustrates the warning of Jesus on avoiding covetousness. Jesus refuses to interfere with family inheritance disputes and emphatically states that a person 2 ̆ 7 s life is not en to perisseuein. He requests that his followers avoid all pleonexia by accepting God as their Sovereign. Covetousness shuts one off from his fellow man 2 ̆ 7 and his divine Lord, by making him irtcapable for a self-giving love of God and neighbour. The parable of the Rich Fool diverts our attention from general to individual eschatology. The historical situation of the parable probably regards the condition of some rich people in the early Church who accepted Christianity but did not submit their riches to their faith. The rich man of the parable is a successful farmer in the eyes of his partners, but, in the eyes of God he is a fool. Because he does 2 ̆ 7 <b>nt</b> <b>take</b> his creatural condition seriously. He is thesaurizon heauto while he should be eis theon plouton. The best commentary of this logion are parallel text 2 ̆ 7 s in Lk 12, 33 and 18, 22. »Treasure in heaven in primarily personal friendship with God, which is offered in situations of poverty and wealth as well. The aim of life is not to gather up material wealth but to accept and maintain friendship with God offered trough Jesus Christ. This friendship cannot be gained or maintained if a man does not stick with his brethren, especially the poor. Therefore, to »be rich in God 2 ̆ 7 s sight* (12, 21) is the same as selling one 2 ̆ 7 s possesions and giving alms (12, 33 — 34) for the sake of receiving treasure in heaven, or following Jesus in order to gain treasure in heaven (18, 28 — 30) ...|$|E

40|$|Borna disease virus (BDV) is a {{neurotropic}} enveloped RNA {{virus that}} causes a noncytolytic, persistent infection of {{the central nervous system}} in mammals. BDV belongs to the order Mononegavirales, which also includes the negative-strand RNA viruses (NSVs) Ebola, Marburg, vesicular stomatitis, rabies, mumps, and measles. BDV-M, the matrix protein (M-protein) of BDV, is the smallest M-protein (16. 2 kDa) among the NSVs. M-proteins {{play a critical role in}} virus assembly and budding, mediating the interaction between the viral capsid, envelope, and glycoprotein spikes, and are as such responsible for the structural stability and individual form of virus particles. Here, we report the 3 D structure of BDV-M, a full-length M-protein structure from a nonsegmented RNA NSV. The BDV-M monomer exhibits structural similarity to the N-terminal domain of the Ebola M-protein (VP 40), while the surface charge of the tetramer provides clues to the membrane association of BDV-M. Additional electron density in the crystal reveals the presence of bound nucleic acid, interpreted as cytidine- 5 ′-monophosphate.

40|$|Introduction: In recent years, {{there has}} been growing {{interest}} in regulation of gene expression by small non-coding RNA (sRNA). The first sRNA discovered in 1960 s was 6 S RNA from E. coli (length ~ 184 <b>nt).</b> It <b>took</b> ~ 30 years to obtain meaningful insights into its function. 6 S RNA binds during stationary phase to RNA polymerase (RNAP) containing sigma factor 70 (primary sigma factor), thereby preventing transcription from σ 70 - dependent promoters.

The amplified fragments from the 14 prototypes were completely differentiated with a combination of three restriction endonucleases, EcoT 14 I, HaeIII, and HintI. We applied this new method for 127 samples of conjunctival scrapings from patients with conjunctivitis and compared the results with those obtained with the combination of culture isolation and a neutralization test (NT). PCR gave a positive result in 69 of 127 cases (54. 3 %), while only 61 of the 127 samples (48. 0 %) tested positive by culture isolation.

The aims of this study were to quantify soil bulk density (BD), porosity in the soil macropore domain (PORp) and in the soil matrix domain (PORm), air capacity in the soil matrix (ACm), field capacity (FC), and soil water storage capacity (FC/TP) in the row (R), interrow (IR), and intermediate position between R and IR (designated IP) in the 0. 0 - 0. 10 and 0. 10 - 0. 20 m soil layers under NT; and to verify if these soil properties have systematic variation in sampling positions related to rows and interrows of corn. Soil sampling was carried out in transect perpendicular to the corn rows in which 40 sampling points were selected at each position (R, IR, IP) and in each soil layer, obtaining undisturbed samples to determine the aforementioned soil physical properties. The influence of sampling position on systematic variation of soil physical properties was evaluated by spectral analysis. In the 0. 0 - 0. 1 m layer, tilling the crop rows at the time of planting led to differences in BD, PORp, ACm, FC and FC/TP only in the R position. In the R position, the FC/TP ratio was considered close to ideal (0. 66), indicating good water and air availability at this sampling position. The R position also showed BD values lower than the critical bulk density that restricts root growth, suggesting good soil physical conditions for seed germination and plant establishment. Spectral analysis indicated that there was systematic variation in soil physical properties evaluated in the 0. 0 - 0. 1 m layer, except for PORm. These results indicated that the soil physical properties evaluated in the 0. 0 - 0. 1 m layer were associated with soil position in the rows and interrows of corn. Thus, proper assessment of soil physical properties under <b>NT</b> must <b>take</b> into consideration the sampling positions and previous location of crop rows and interrows...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The type III {{secretion}} system (T 3 SS) is {{a molecular}} machine in gram negative bacteria that exports proteins through both membranes to the extracellular environment. It {{has been previously}} demonstrated that the T 3 SS encoded in Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 1 (SPI- 1) can be harnessed to export recombinant proteins. Here, we demonstrate the secretion {{of a variety of}} unfolded spider silk proteins and use these data to quantify the constraints of this system with respect to the export of recombinant protein. Results To test how the timing and level of protein expression affects secretion, we designed a hybrid promoter that combines an IPTG-inducible system with a natural genetic circuit that controls effector expression in Salmonella (psicA). LacO operators are placed in various locations in the psicA promoter and the optimal induction occurs when a single operator is placed at the + 5 nt (234 -fold) and a lower basal level of expression is achieved when a second operator is placed at - 63 <b>nt</b> to <b>take</b> advantage of DNA looping. Using this tool, we find that the secretion efficiency (protein secreted divided by total expressed) is constant as a function of total expressed. We also demonstrate that the secretion flux peaks at 8 hours. We then use whole gene DNA synthesis to construct codon optimized spider silk genes for full-length (3129 amino acids) Latrodectus hesperus dragline silk, Bombyx mori cocoon silk, and Nephila clavipes flagelliform silk and PCR is used to create eight truncations of these genes. These proteins are all unfolded polypeptides and they encompass a variety of length, charge, and amino acid compositions. We find those proteins fewer than 550 amino acids reliably secrete and the probability declines significantly after ~ 700 amino acids. There also is a charge optimum at - 2. 4, and secretion efficiency declines for very positively or negatively charged proteins. There is no significant correlation with hydrophobicity. Conclusions We show that the natural system encoded in SPI- 1 only produces high titers of secreted protein for 4 - 8 hours when the natural psicA promoter is used to drive expression. Secretion efficiency can be high, but declines for charged or large sequences. A quantitative characterization of these constraints will facilitate the effective use and engineering of this system. </p...|$|R

40|$|D. Litt. et. PhilThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to answer the following question: The funding of the church according to the book of Acts: Socialistic or capitalistic? Can this model of giving be developed and defended that promotes and integrates the believer and his material possessions {{while at the same time}} respecting the believer as an autonomous agent, who, as such, may be led by the Holy Spirit to give up all his possessions in support of the work of the Lord? In order to answer the research question a discourse analysis of selected verses in the Sermon on the Mount (SM) regarding possessions is undertaken as well as an analysis of verses selected from the book of Acts regarding money and possessions. The ethical guidelines as presented in the SM, can serve as a guideline for each believer as the SM presents God’s standard in a practical manner. Due to the social environment during the first century A. D., which could have had an influence on the manner in which the early believers used their material possessions to support the work of the Lord, a social scientific investigation of the first century A. D. is undertaken. The introduction to the research as well as an Old Testament (OT) background regarding the role possessions played in worshiping the deity is presented in the opening chapters. The conclusion reached was that money and possessions have always played a vital role in the relationship between the believer and the deity. It was also established that specific laws concerning “giving” developed over a period during OT times, which was meticulously followed by Israel. The New Testament (<b>NT),</b> however, <b>takes</b> on a new direction when it comes to giving, and this new standard of giving is investigated against the backdrop of the social and religious environment of the first century A. D. The question as proposed in the study is answered in chapter 5. Guidelines regarding “giving” are submitted in which I hope would free many believers from the legalism clearly evident in many teachings. Chapter 6 contains a critical evaluation of the two “giving” philosophies, presented by scholars. This study xiv reveals that much of what is being taught and practised among believers today with regard to giving to God, is based on the prescriptive patterns of the OT examples of giving. Most of these models or theories fail to provide specific guidelines for the believer to make the crucial distinction between autonomous choices and choices dictated by the Holy Spirit.

In Pakistan, about 10 % of the general population is infected with HCV. Of those acutely infected with HCV, approximately 80 % develop chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis C can lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in a substantial number of patients. The mechanism of viral persistence is largely unknown, although the high genetic variability is thought to playa key role. This study is aimed at determining the various viral and host factors responsible for disease detection, severity, clearance, spread and persistence. The present study was started in May 2000 to address seven objectives. A summary of the research results obtained for each objective is given below. The first objective {{of this study was to}} sequence the 5 â&# 8364;&# 8482;Untranslated Region (5 â&# 8364;&# 8482;UTR) region of HCV -RNA isolated from HCV positive patients from different parts of Pakistan. During the course of this study, total 100 HCV RNA PCR positive serum samples collected from different parts of the country were used for sequence analysis of 5 â&# 8364;&# 8482;UTR of HCV. Four primers were designed based on highly conserved 5 â&# 8364;&# 8482;UTR of HCV genome for the amplification and sequencing of 5 â&# 8364;&# 8482;NCR. The sequence from nt: - 35 to- 319 (285 <b>nt)</b> was <b>taken</b> for analysis. Pakistani isolates sequenced in the present study were aligned with the representative number of sequences for each major genotype and subtype selected from the GenBank database. The results of the phylogenetic analysis of the sequenced samples showed that genotype 3 and type I are the predominant genotypes circulating in Pakistan, with an overall prevalence of 62 % and 12 %, respectively. Type 2 viruses were found 8 %. Type 4 viruses (3 %) were seen only in NWFP. The second objective of the study was to investigate and isolate novel HCV isolates from Pakistan. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, the 100 Pakistani isolates were classified as follows: 38 % (n = 38) were type 3 a, 21 % (n = 21) were type 3 b, 3 % (n = 3) were type 3 c, 7 % (n = 7) were type 1 a. 5 % (n = 5) were type 1 b/ 1 c, 5 % (n = 5) were typ, 2 a/ 2 c, 3 % (n = 3) were type 2 b, 3 % (n = 3) were type 4, and 14 % (n = 14) were novel genotypes. One isolate, PP 10, still remained nontypeable. The overall nucleotide similarity among different Pakistani isolates was 92. 50 %Â± 0. 50 %. The percent nucleotide identity (PNI) was 98. 11 %Â± 0. 50 % within Pakistani type 1 sequences, 98. 10 %Â± 0. 60 % for type 2 sequences, 97. 97 %Â± 0. 50 % for type 3 sequences, and 99. 80 %Â± 0. 20 % for type 4 sequences. The PNI between different genotypes was 93. 90 %Â± 0. 20 % for type 1 and type 3, 94. 80 %Â± 0. 12 % for type 1 and type 4, and 94. 40 %Â± 0. 22 % for type 3 and type 4. There was a stretch of hypervariable region from n 1 : 166 to 86 in the 5 â&# 8364;&# 8482;NCR that had motifs for different genotypes. Pakistani isolates showed 7. 5 %Â± 0. 50 % nucleotide variability in this region. The comparatively conserved strctd 1 from nt 241 to 165 showed only 3. 30 %Â± 1. 06 % variation. It was not possible to differentiate between type 1 band 1 c isolates further into different subtypes. Both types clustered together. Similarly in the case of 2 a and 2 c, no differentiation was possible in the tree. In the case of the type 3 isolates, there was a Clear clustering of isolates into subtypes 3 a, 3 b and 3 c. This study showed that type 3 and type 1 seem to be the predominant genotypes circulating in different parts of Pakistan. More or less equal proportions of type 1 and type 3 isolates were seen in Balochistan. The third objective of the study was to establish a simple, rapid and reliable genotyping system for well-characterized Pakistani HCV isolates and to determine the suitability of this assay for the routine determination of HCV genotypes. So, a new genotyping system was established for the specific detection of HCV genotypes 1 a, 1 b, 1 c, 2 a, 2 b, 2 c, 3 a, 3 b, 3 c, 4 a-h, 5 a and 6 a during the course of this study. Total 15 primers were designed for this new genotyping system. Both the outer sense and anti-sense primers and inner sense primer were designed on the basis of the conserved nature of these sequences. Genotype-specific primers were designed on the basis of 116 HCV isolates. The antisense primers were designed on the basis of the conserved nature of those sequences within a genotype and their poor homology with the sequences derived from other HCV genotypes. Extensive experiments were performed to optimize the genotyping PCR. Serum samples having known genotypes were used as positive controls to validate the developed assays and to generate PCR band patterns. Band patterns generated from the clinical serum samples from HCV patients were compared to the patterns produced from these control samples. In addition, the type-specific bands were sequenced from the test patients and control clinical samples to further validate the nested type-specific PCR test results. Sensitivity and specificity of the system was determined by analyzing 260 samples simultaneously by this HCV genotyping system, Ohnoâ&# 8364;&# 8482;s genotyping system and commercially available serotyping kit. The system showed 79. 2 % concordance with Ohnoâ&# 8364;&# 8482;s system and 65. 38 % with Serotyping system. Samples with discordant results were sequenced and their genotypes were determined by molecular evolutionary analysis. In all the discordant samples the assigned genotype of the present system was correct. The fourth objective of the present study was to establish a genotyping system for mixed HCV infections as to date the true prevalence of HCV mixed-genotype infections has not been established mainly because currently available methods are not suitable for the detection of mixed genotypes in a viral population. A new genotyping method, primer-specific PCR followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (TSPCR-PAGE), which is more reliable than other genotyping assays was developed for the detection of HCV mixed-genotype infections. A genotype present at levels as low as 8. 3 % in a defined mix of HCV genotypes was detected, showing a 20 -fold increase in sensitivity over that of direct DNA sequencing. A total of 50 HCV isolates from patients who received multiple blood transfusions were genotyped and analyzed for a comparative study of the accuracy between the present system and two other genotyping methods. The results showed that viruses in approximately 42 % of the samples from this group determined to be infected with mixed genotypes by TSPCR-PAGE. Serotyping assay and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis performed poorly, being able to identify only 18 % and 10 % of mixed-genotype infections, respectively. The data lead us to conclude that HCV mixed-genotype infections are more common than previously estimated and that TSPCR-P AGE may be the method of choice when detection of genotypes present at low levels in mixed-genotype infections is required due to its higher level of sensitivity. The fifth specific objective of the study was to find out the common genotypes of HCV present in well-characterized Pakistani HCV isolates. Total 3351 serum samples were tested by type-specific genotyping assay. All the tested serum samples were HCV-RNA positive by PCR. Out of the total 3351 tested serum samples, type-specific PCR fragments were observed in 3150 (94. 00 %) serum samples. The distribution of genotypes of the 3150 typable samples as determined by this assay, was as follows: 280 (8. 35 %). patients were infected with HCV genotype la, 101 (3. 01 %) patient were infected with genotype 1 b, 5 (0. 15 %) with 1 c, 252 (7. 52 %) patient were infected with subtype 2 a, 27 (0. 80 %) were infected with subtype 2 b, 3 (0. 09 %) were with type 2 c, 1664 (49. 05 %) patients were infected with subtype 3 a, 592 (17. 66 %) were infected with genotype 3 b, 25 (0. 75 %) were with 3 c, 50 (2 %) patient were infected with genotype 4, 6 (0. 18 %) were infected with subtype 5 a, 4 (0. 12 %) were infected with subtype 6 a and 161 (4. 80 %) patient was infected with mixed infection. Two hundred and one (6. 00 %) serum samples were found undetermined by the present genotyping system. The aims of the 6 th objective of the study were to determine the rate of sustained virological response (SVR) and the factors associated with SVR in chronic hepatitis C patients treated with interferon alpha and ribavirin combination therapy. Four hundred consecutive patients were prospectively evaluated and treated with combination of Interferon Alfa 2 (a or b) three million units subcutaneously three injection weekly and ribavirin 800 - 1200 mg orally daily for 24 weeks or 48 weeks and followed for another 6 months. End of the treatment response, sustained viral response and side effects were noted. Of four hundred patients, 394 completed the treatment. Over 67 % responded at the end of treatment and 16 % relapsed. Out of treated, 48. 55 % males and 57. 62 % females had sustained viral response with a total combined sustained viral response rate of 51. 56 %. Patients with cirrhosis had no sustained viral response. Thirty percent patients took longer than three months to show HCV RNA negativity. Side effects were usual and tolerable and only 1. 5 % discontinued the treatment. Non-responders were mostly males above age 50 years. In conclusion, twenty-four weeks combination treatment with Interferon alpha 2 a or 2 b and ribavirin has given 51. 56 % sustained viral response in patients and treatment was well tolerated. The seventh and last objective of this research was to assess the association between chronic hepatitis C infection with different genotypes and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a population or patients presenting to a various hospitals. Eighty three cases or histologically confirmed liver cancer due to HCV presenting to the various hospital of Pakistan were genotyped. HCV genotype 3 a was most frequently represented (34 of 83 patients). In the HCC patient population, broader distributions of genotypes were present (genotype 1 a: 8; genotype 1 b: 2; genotype 3 a: 34; genotype 3 b: 13; mixed genotypes 3 a & 3 b: 10; 1 a & 3 a: 8; and la & 3 b: 6). Two of the cases were untypable as no type-specific bands were obtained for them. A strong association between chronic HCV infection and hepatocarcinogenesis in the Pakistani population was observed. The study was unable to distinguish whether the high prevalence of genotype 3 a in the HCC population reflected increased oncogenicity in itself, or whether 3 a was simply the most prevalent genotype in Pakistan when these patients were infected...|$|R
