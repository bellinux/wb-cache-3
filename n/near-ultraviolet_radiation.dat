Deeper into the ultraviolet spectrum, however, potassium iodide has a strong absorption line due to the formation of chargeless particles called excitons. These excitons transfer energy to the electrons in the F-Centers with remarkably high efficiency, and these excited electrons are excited from the crystals in exciton-induced photoemission. Apker observed the same sort of behavior in other crystals such as barium oxide.|$|E
40|$|The {{wavelengths}} of sunlight {{considered to be}} responsible for erythema and skin cancer formation are in the range 290 – 340 nm. Formulated sunscreens usually contain an agent that absorbs in this wavelength region, {{and one of the most}} widely used is para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). Previous work has demonstrated the sensitization by PABA of the lethal and mutagenic effects of <b>near-ultraviolet</b> (UV) <b>radiation</b> in a model bacterial system. Experiments with the mouse lymphoma L 5178 Y cell line have now demonstrated sensitization by PABA of the lethal effect of near-UV radiation, the extent of which, after correction for absorption of UV radiation by PABA, bears a direct relationship to PABA concentration. The limitations of these results in predicting the response of human skin to the presence of PABA during exposure to UV radiation is emphasized...|$|R
5|$|Historically, optical astronomy, {{also called}} visible light astronomy, {{is the oldest}} form of astronomy. Images of {{observations}} were originally drawn by hand. In the late 19th century {{and most of the}} 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment. Modern images are made using digital detectors, particularly using charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium. Although visible light itself extends from approximately 4000 Å to 7000 Å (400 nm to 700nm), that same equipment can be used to observe some <b>near-ultraviolet</b> and near-infrared <b>radiation.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{cytotoxic}} {{action of}} <b>near-ultraviolet</b> (UVA) <b>radiation</b> on cultured mammalian cells {{is dependent upon}} oxygen, suggesting that reactive oxygen species {{are involved in the}} cellular action of the radiation. Flavins are thought to be an important chromophore for photo-induced skin injury. Irradiation of riboflavin with UVA radiation is known to produce singlet oxygen, superoxide anions, and triplet-state riboflavin radicals, which, however, are immediately quenched by many constituents of the human skin. If the chemical produces a long-lived reactive oxygen species, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), after UVA radiation, its deleterious effect is not limited to its generation site. Thus, we investigated whether H 2 O 2 is produced in UVA-irradiated riboflavin solution and whether it {{plays an important role in}} the cytotoxic action of the solution. The solution showed a marked cytotoxic effect when placed on human fibroblasts, and cytotoxicity was retained in the solution for at least 40 min after radiation. Most of the toxicity appeared to be derived from H 2 O 2 produced in the solution, because the solution lost its cytotoxicity as a result of catalase treatment, and the resultant restoration of survival was almost complete. Under our conditions, two molecules of riboflavin were calculated to produce one molecule of H 2 O 2 after UVA radiation...|$|R

At low H 2 O 2 concentrations (6 X 10 (- 6) to 6 X 10 (- 4) M), synergistic killing occurred in all strains except those containing a mutation in recA. This RecA-repairable damage was absent from stationary-phase cells but increased in logarithmic cells {{as a function of}} growth rate. At higher H 2 O 2 concentrations (above 6 X 10 (- 4) M) plus <b>near-ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation,</b> all strains, including those with a mutation in recA, were synergistically killed; thus, at high H 2 O 2 concentrations, the damage was not RecA repairable...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>near-ultraviolet</b> <b>{{radiation}}</b> on choroidal blood flow were studied in aphakic rabbit eyes. After lens extraction, eyes {{were exposed to}} monochrometic nera-ultraviolet radiation with a wavelength of 365 nm and radiant exposure of 8. 0 J/cm 2. Choroidal blood flow {{was measured by the}} hydrogen clearance method 3, 7 and 14 days after exposure. Eyes were enucleated after the measurement of choroidal blood flow and examined histopathologically. Choroidal blood flow in the eyes wan significantly reduced 7 and 14 days after exposure compared with control eyes. Histopathologically, the photoreceptors showed markde destruction 3, 7 and 14 days after exposure, while the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris remained intact during this period. These results suggested that choroidal blood flow was reduced by decreased oxygen consumption in the outer retina {{as a result of the}} destruction of photoreceptors after exposure to <b>near-ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Beams of <b>near-ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> {{at several}} {{principal}} emission {{lines of a}} mercury arc were isolated with a grating monochromator and directed upon cell suspensions. During subsequent incubation at room temperature in Nutrient Broth, the population was studied by removing samples and obtaining cell numbers and cell size distributions with an electronic cell counter. Division delay without lethality was observed. The shapes of the dose-response curves for induction, the doses of <b>near-ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> required, and the action spectrum for division delay {{were found to be}} similar to those for growth delay (in broth) and for photoprotection. These findings indicate that all three effects, division delay, growth delay, and photoprotection, are induced by a common type of critical event. Changes in cell size distribution in the culture during incubation in Nutrient Broth after near-ultraviolet irradiation are very similar for control and irradiated populations, although these changes occur at a much later time in the irradiated population. This indicates that, in Nutrient Broth, the population recovers completely from the inhibition of growth and division, thus justifying use of the term “delay,” and suggesting that the damage is nongenetic...|$|E

However, total nitrogen concentrations decreased. The responses to near-ultraviolet were interrelated with intensity of visible light. The presence of near-ultraviolet (which accounted for less than 4 % of the total light energy) along with visible light resulted in component concentration differences similar to those caused by much greater increases of visible light without near-ultraviolet...|$|E
40|$|Several {{photometric}} measurements of Venus {{made from the}} Pioneer Venus orbiter and probes indicate that solar <b>near-ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> is being absorbed {{throughout much of the}} main cloud region, but little above the clouds or within the first one or two optical depths. Radiative transfer calculations were carried out to simulate both Pioneer Venus and ground-based data for a number of proposed cloud compositions. This comparison rules out models invoking nitrogen dioxide, meteoritic material, and volatile metals as the source of the ultraviolet absorption. Models involving either small (approximately 1 micrometer) or large (approximately 10 micrometers) sulfur particles have same serious difficulties, while ones invoking sulfur dioxide gas appear to be promising...|$|E
40|$|<b>Near-ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> {{was found}} to be lethal for {{mammalian}} cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum or phenol red. Irradiation of the cells with near-ultraviolet light while the cells were in phosphate-buffered-saline abolished the lethal effect. When only the medium was irradiated followed by the addition of unirradiated cells and serum, the cells were still killed. The photoactive components of the medium for this effect were riboflavin, tryptophan, and tyrosine. When riboflavin was deleted from the medium being irradiated and added later, almost no killing was detected. Irradiation of salt solution of riboflavin and tryptophan or riboflavin and tyrosine, resulted in cell killing. Little or no killing resulted when riboflavin, tryptophan, or tyrosine was irradiated singly...|$|E
40|$|An action {{spectrum}} for growth delay induced in Escherichia coli B/r by far-ultraviolet radiation (230 to 295 nm) was obtained. It resembles the {{action spectrum}} for killing {{obtained in the}} same experiments, indicating that the chromophore for growth delay is probably {{the same as the}} chromophore for killing. Another action spectrum for killing, obtained under conditions more suitable for chromophore identification, suggests that nucleic acid, either deoxyribonucleic acid or ribonucleic acid, is the chromophore for growth delay induced by far ultraviolet. Isoprenoid quinones, which seem to be important chromophores for growth delay induced by <b>near-ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> (above 300 nm), appear to play a negligible role in growth delay induced by wavelengths below 300 nm...|$|E

40|$|The X-ray mapping {{procedure}} of Manney and Mortimer (1964) {{is the most}} widely applicable and convenient method for fine structure analysis in yeast, but suffers the disadvantage that suitable X-ray machines or gamma ray sources are very expensive. Although many other recombinogens are known, none gives a linear dose-response like X-rays and few are as convenient or give as reproducible results. Experiments with Saccharomyces cerevisiae reported in this paper show, however, that the <b>near-ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> emitted by fluorescent sunlamps gives linear dose-response relations, as reproducible results as ionizing radiations, and map distances which correlate highly with those obtained by using 60 Co gamma rays.

40|$|<b>Near-ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> from Nova Cygni 1975 was {{detected}} by the Copernicus satellite on five occasions from 1975 September 1 to 1975 September 9. The nova was not seen in the UV after this date. The principal result was the observation of a broad emission feature from the Mg II doublet at 2800 A. The absence of strong UV radiation at shorter wavelengths suggests that these lines are produced by collisional excitation in the outer layers of an expanding shell with electron temperature of approximately 4000 K. The absence of observed emission lines from highly ionized species indicates {{that the amount of}} material with log T between 4. 4 and 5. 7 is less than 0. 001 times that which produces the Mg II emission.

Efficient Yb 3 + emission (F- 2 (5 / 2) -> F- 2 (7 / 2)) was detected under the excitation of defects absorption at 314 nm. The occurrence of energy transfer is proven by both steady state and time-resolved emission spectra, respectively, at 15 K. The Yb 2 O 3 concentration dependent energy transfer efficiency has also been evaluated, and the maximum value is 65 % for 8 mol % Yb 2 O 3 doped glass ceramic.

40|$|Continuously growing {{cultures}} of E. coli B/r were irradiated with a fluence of broad-band <b>near-ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> (315 - 405 nm) sufficient to cause extensive growth delay and complete cessation of net RNA synthesis. Chloramphenicol treatment {{was found to}} stimulate resumption of RNA synthesis, similar to that observed with chloramphenicol treatment after amino-acid starvation. E. coli strains in which amino-acid starvation does not result in cessation of RNA synthesis ("relaxed" or rel- strains) show no cessation of growth and only a slight effect on {{the rate of growth}} or of RNA synthesis. These findings show that such near-UV fluences do not inactivate the RNA synthetic machinery but affect the regulation of RNA synthesis, in a manner similat to that produced by amino-acid starvation. Such regulation is believed to be mediated through alterations in concentration of guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), and our estimations of ppGpp after near-UV irradiation are consistent with such an interpretation. These data, combined with earlier published data, strongly suggest that the mechanism of near-UV-induced growth delay in E. coli involves partial inactivation of certain tRNA species, which is interpreted by the cell {{in a manner similar to}} that of amino-acid starvation, causing a rise in ppGpp levels, a shut-off of net RNA synthesis, and the induction of a growth delay...|$|E

Near-UV radiation produced increased frequencies of G:C to A:T transitions, G:C to T:A and A:T to T:A transversions, and small increases in frameshift mutations in wild-type cells. Tester strains lacking superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (sodAsodB double mutants) demonstrated high spontaneous mutation frequencies and increased near-UV sensitivity. The double mutants also showed increased mutations induced by near-UV compared to either isogenic wild type, sodA or sodB single mutants.

40|$|Metalized Teflon FEP (fluorinated {{ethylene}} propylene, DuPont), {{a common}} thermal control material, {{has been found}} to degrade in the low-Earth-orbit space environment. The aluminized-FEP (Al-FEP) exterior layer on the Hubble Space Telescope has become extremely embrittled, with extensive cracking occurring on all sides of the telescope. This embrittlement has been primarily attributed to radiation exposure (x-rays from solar flares, electron/proton radiation, and possibly <b>near-ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation)</b> combined with thermal cycling. Limited samples of FEP tested after long-term exposure to low Earth orbit on the Hubble Space Telescope and on the Long Duration Exposure Facility indicated that there might be continued degradation in tensile properties over time. An investigation was conducted at the NASA Glenn Research Center to evaluate the effect of air and vacuum storage on the mechanical properties of x-ray-exposed FEP. Aluminized-FEP (5 -mil-thick) tensile samples were x-ray exposed with 15. 3 -kV copper xrays for 2 hr, reducing the percent elongation to failure by approximately 50 percent in comparison to that for pristine Al-FEP. X-ray-exposed samples were stored in air or under vacuum for various time periods to see the effect of storage on tensile properties. Tensile results indicated that samples stored in air had larger decreases in tensile properties than samples stored under vacuum had, as seen in the graph. Samples stored under vacuum (for up to 400 hr) showed no further decrease in tensile properties over time, whereas samples stored in air (for up to 900 hr) appeared to show decreases in tensile properties over time. X-ray-exposed samples stored in air developed a hazy appearance in the exposed area, as seen in the photographs. When the source of the haziness was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, it was found to reside at the Al/FEP interface as witnessed by an increased surface roughness of the aluminized side of the material and a dramatic decrease in the adhesion between the Al and FEP. Optical properties of air-stored irradiated samples showed an increase in the diffuse reflectance, which is consistent with observed roughening that was characterized by AFM. These findings indicate that air exposure helps degrade x-ray-irradiated FEP. These results indicate that proper sample handling and storage is necessary with space-retrieved materials and with those exposed to ground-based irradiation simulation exposures...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{two kinds}} of {{effective}} VLD photocatalysts, AgBr-Ag-Bi 2 WO 6 nanojunction and Zn:In(OH) ySz solid solution nanoplates have been synthesized and characterized. Zn:In(OH) ySz solid solution nanoplates (Synthesis conditions: 45 mmol L- 1 thiourea, 26 mmol L- 1 SDS, 0. 4 ≤X≤ 0. 7) have high VLD photocatalytic activities {{on the degradation of}} Rhodamine B (RhB), which is due to their suitable band gap and potentials of conduction band and valence band as well as their uniform and small diameter sizes (about 10 nm in width and about 15 nm in length). AgBr-Ag-Bi 2 WO 6 nanojunction exhibits excellent VLD photocatalytic performance both on the degradation of Procion Red MX- 5 B and pentachlorophenol, and on the disinfection of various bacteria including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Alteromonas macleodii. Its excellent performance results from the broadened visible-light response and the synergic effect among the three components under the visible light irradiation, namely the vectorial electron transfer of Bi 2 WO 6 →Ag→AgBr. Moreover, a novel and versatile partition setup has been first constructed to investigate the fundamental mechanism of photocatalytic process. The results indicate that the functional reactive species produced by VLD Zn:In(OH) ySz solid solution nanoplates mainly remain on the surface, thus the direct contact between Zn:In(OH) ySz solid solution nanoplates and RhB is a prerequisite for the degradation of RhB during the photocatalytic process. However, the functional reactive species produced by AgBr-Ag-Bi 2 WO 6 nanojunction can diffuse into the bulk, thus the direct contact between the AgBr-Ag-Bi 2 WO 6 nanojunction and bacteria is unnecessary for the photocatalytic disinfection of bacteria. Recent years, environmental problems related to organic pollutants and pathogenic microorganisms have emerged as a high national and international priority. To address these significant problems, photocatalysis causes increasing interest as a kind of green and energy-saving technology. However, the traditional photocatalyst TiO 2 can only be excited by ultraviolet or <b>near-ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation,</b> which merely occupies about 4 % of the solar light spectrum. Notably, the visible region covers the largest proportion of the solar spectrum (about 48 %). In order to efficiently utilize solar light, the development of visible-light-driven (VLD) photocatalysts with excellent performances has been urged. Therefore, in this work, the exploration of VLD photocatalyst gives us the opportunities to utilize solar energy to solve the environmental problems and energy crisis, and the investigation of fundamental mechanism provides us more deep understanding for photocatalytic process.
