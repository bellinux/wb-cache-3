40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether or}} not the long-term government bond rate could reasonably be employed as the rate of return on public capital when calculating public sector gross domestic product. It finds that the rate of return on public capital is lower than often reported and is roughly consistent with the rate of return on private capital. Given that there is a range of estimates that are plausible, the paper concludes that the long-run government bond rate {{could be used as a}} conservative estimate for the rate of return for public infrastructure. Previous studies have shown that production function estimates tend to find rates of return that are implausibly large, while cost function estimates appear more reasonable. This paper shows that public capital and total factor productivity (TFP) growth behave similarly, and argues that production function estimates for the impact of public capital overstate its impact as a result, catching part of what belongs in estimates of TFP. It also shows that the similarity between the growth in public capital and TFP leads to a large confidence interval around public capital elasticity estimates derived from the production function framework. The paper then proceeds by generating a confidence interval from the production function estimated first with and then without TFP growth. It then uses a cost function to pinpoint more precisely estimates for the marginal cost savings from public capital. Importantly, the estimate derived from the cost function is found in the lower part of the confidence interval derived from the production function. The rate of return associated with the overlapping estimates is then shown to cover a range that extends from the average long-run government bond rate to the rate of return on private capital.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to identify the key determinants of Australia's competitive advantage in the <b>Non-residential</b> <b>construction</b> industry. Porter's Five Competitive Forces Model has been used to analyse the existing industry structure both in Australia and Thailand. In addition. Porter's Diamond Model has been used for identifying the key determinants of Australia's competitive advantage in the industry. The study has drawn upon industry data obtained from interviews with operation managers and executives of major Australian firms in the <b>non-residential</b> <b>construction</b> industry who have been successfully operating in Thailand over the last ten years. Research, undertaken in Australia and Thailand, includes interviews and case study information gained from industry, government and academia. A key finding applicable to each case study was that Australian <b>non-residential</b> <b>construction</b> firms operating in Thailand competed successfully on higher order technological expertise in construction management and operation. Expertise and innovation was created and sustained at home through vertically integrated clusters of industry suppliers to the main contractor and replicated or adapted abroad to local circumstances. Australia's national competitive advantage in the industry has relied on the interaction of key determinants. Favourable factor conditions have provided Australia with a key advantage base, for example, skilled personnel, experience in a variety of construction areas due to the demands of Australia's geography and development needs, and adequate infrastructure provision both physical and capital. Favourable factor conditions combined with intense service rivalry at home, supportive related industries, demanding buyers, and effective competition policy are the key to Australia's success. The study goes on to explain the role that industry and government can play to ensure Australia remains internationally competitive in the industry. In addition summary recommendations are provided of the steps that Thailand needs to take to improve its competitiveness in general and the development of the construction industry in particular...|$|E
