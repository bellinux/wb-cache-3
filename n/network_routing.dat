40|$|Abstract- Most {{existing}} {{routing protocols}} for mobile ad hoc networks take a single routing strategy for {{different types of}} <b>networks.</b> <b>Routing</b> protocols suitable for small networks may not scale well in large <b>networks.</b> <b>Routing</b> protocols perform well in sparse networks may not suitable for dense networks. To achieve good performance, different routing strategies {{should be used for}} different types of networks. This philosophy motivates our design of a new routing protocol called Adaptive Cell-Relay (ACR) routing protocol. Our ACR protocol can adapt the <b>routing</b> strategy for <b>networks</b> with different node density so that high efficiency, low delay and scalability can be achieved. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the ACR has much better performance and scalability than a popular routing protocol – Location-Aid Routing (LAR).
