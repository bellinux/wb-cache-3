40|$|Se da a conocer la detección en Cataluña de tres ejemplares de Hemaris fuciformis (Linnaeus) que presentan numerosas escamas de color marrón en las zonas alares donde los imagos normales muestran sólo la base membranosa transparente. En consecuencia, los ejemplares presentan un aspecto distinto al patrón de la especie, el cual se fundamenta en un mimetismo batesiano con himenópteros, sin poder descartar cierto grado de mimetismo mulleriano. Se muestran fotografías de estos ejemplares y de los habituales, así como detalles aumentados de las áreas con acumulación de las escamas alares. Finalmente, se comentan las posibles explicaciones de este fenómeno. Lost of wing {{scales of}} the pharate adult in the Broad-bordered <b>Bee</b> <b>Hawkmoth</b> Hemaris fuciformis (Linnaeus, 1758) (Lepidoptera, Sphingidae, Macroglossinae). Three {{specimens}} of the sphingid moth Hemaris fuciformis (Linnaeus) showing unusual brown scales on the forewings have been detected in Catalonia. Normally imagines only present wing scales on the outer margins of the forewings being the rest scaleless. As a result of this, the three specimens present a wing pattern certainly different to that of their species, which is otherwise hymenopteran based batesian mimicry, though certain degree of mullerian mimicry could also be present. These three specimens as well as normal ones have been photographed. Close-ups of the areas where these scales accumulate on the wing are also shown. Finally, possible explanations to this phenomenon are brought forward...|$|R
40|$|Shifts in {{pollination}} syndromes involve coordinated {{changes in}} multiple ﬂoral traits. This {{raises the question}} of how plants can cope with rapid changes in pollinator availability by the slow process of accumulation of mutations in multiple genes. Here we study the transition from <b>bee</b> to <b>hawkmoth</b> pollination in the genus Petunia. Interspeciﬁc crosses followed by single locus introgressions were used to recreate putative intermediate evolutionary stages in the evolution of moth pollination. The effect of the loss/gain of petal color was asymmetric: it had no inﬂuence on the established pollinator but enhanced visitation by the new pollinator. Therefore, shifts in pollination syndromes may proceed through intermediate stages of reduced specialization and consequently enhanced reproductive assurance. The loss of petal color in moth-pollinated Petunia involves null mutations in a single regulatory gene, An 2. Such simple genetic changes may be sufﬁciently rapid and frequent to ensure survival during pollinator failure...|$|R
40|$|The role of petal spurs and {{specialized}} pollinator interactions {{has been studied}} since Darwin. Aquilegia petal spurs exhibit striking size and shape diversity, correlated with specialized pollinators ranging from <b>bees</b> to <b>hawkmoths</b> in a textbook example of adaptive radiation. Despite the evolutionary significance of spur length, remarkably {{little is known about}} Aquilegia spur morphogenesis and its evolution. Using experimental measurements, both at tissue and cellular levels, combined with numerical modelling, we have investigated the relative roles of cell divisions and cell shape in determining the morphology of the Aquilegia petal spur. Contrary to decades-old hypotheses implicating a discrete meristematic zone as the driver of spur growth, we find that Aquilegia petal spurs develop via anisotropic cell expansion. Furthermore, changes in cell anisotropy account for 99 per cent of the spur-length variation in the genus, suggesting that the true evolutionary innovation underlying the rapid radiation of Aquilegia was the mechanism of tuning cell shape...|$|R
40|$|Inga {{species are}} characterised by generalist or mixed {{pollination}} system. However, this feature does not enhance reproductive rates in species with very low fruit set under natural conditions. Some ecological and genetic factors {{are associated with}} this feature, and to test the effect of massive visits on pollination success in Inga subnuda subsp. luschnathiana, we studied the efficacy of polyads deposited on stigmas of flowers isolated from visitors and polyads exposed to visitors. The proportion of polyads fixed in stigmas decreased after exposure to visitors (24 h) in comparison to stigmas isolated from visitors (hummingbirds, <b>bees,</b> wasps, <b>hawkmoths</b> and bats), and fruit set was very low. Furthermore, nectar production, sugar composition and other floral biology traits were evaluated. Increased nectar production, sugar availability and sucrose dominance during the night indicates adaptation to nocturnal visitors and supports their role as main pollinators; although the brush-flower morphology, time of anthesis, nectar dynamics and chemical composition also allow daytime visitors. Thus the species is an important resource for {{a diverse group of}} floral visitors. We conclude that excess visits (diurnal and nocturnal) are responsible for the decrease in fixed polyads in stigmas of I. subnuda subsp. luschnathiana flowers, thus contributing, with others factors, to its low fruit set. Therefore, the generalist pollination system does not result in reproductive advantages because the low fruit set in natural conditions could be the result of a negative effect of visitors/pollinators...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactions}} of plants with their pollinators {{are thought to}} be a driving force in the evolution of angiosperms. Adaptation to a new pollinator involves coordinated changes in multiple floral traits controlled by multiple genes. Surprisingly, such complex genetic shifts have happened numerous times during evolution. Here we report on the genetic basis of the changes in one such trait, floral scent emission, in the genus Petunia (Solanaceae). The increase in the quantity and complexity of the volatiles during the shift from <b>bee</b> to <b>hawkmoth</b> pollination was due to de novo expression of the genes encoding benzoic acid/salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (BSMT) and benzoyl-CoA:benzylalcohol/ 2 -phenylethanol benzoyltransferase (BPBT) together with moderately increased transcript levels for most enzymes of the phenylpropanoid/benzenoid pathway. Loss of cinnamate-CoA ligase (CNL) function as well as a reduction in the expression of the MYB transcription factor ODO 1 explain the loss of scent during the transition from moth to hummingbird pollination. The CNL gene in the hummingbird-adapted species is inactive due to a stop codon, but also appears to have undergone further degradation over time. Therefore, we propose that loss of scent happened relatively early in the transition toward hummingbird pollination, and probably preceded the loss of UV-absorbing flavonols. The discovery that CNL is also involved in the loss of scent during the transition from outcrossing to selfing in Capsella (Brassicaceae) (see the accompanying paper) raises interesting questions about the possible causes of deep evolutionary conservation of the targets of evolutionary change...|$|R
40|$|The large {{terrestrial}} orchid genus Satyrium underwent evolutionary radiations in the Cape floral {{region and}} the grasslands of southern and eastern Africa. These radiations were accompanied by tremendous diversification of the unusual twin-spurred flowers that characterize the genus, but pollination data required to interpret these patterns of floral evolution have been lacking for grassland species in the genus. Here we document pollinators, nectar properties, and levels of pollination success for 11 grassland Satyrium species in southern and south-central Africa. Pollinators of these species include <b>bees,</b> beetles, butterflies, <b>hawkmoths,</b> noctuid moths, long-proboscid flies, and sunbirds. Most species appear to be specialized for pollination by one functional pollinator group. Long-proboscid fly pollination systems are reported {{for the first time}} in Satyrium (in S. macrophyllum and a high-altitude form of S. neglectum). Floral morphology, especially spur length and rostellum structure, differs markedly among plants with different pollinators, while nectar volume, concentration, and sugar composition are fairly uniform across species. Most taxa exhibited high levels of pollination success (> 50 % of flowers pollinated), a trend that can be attributed to the presence of nectar in the twin spurs...|$|R
