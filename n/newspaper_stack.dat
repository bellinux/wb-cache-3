40|$|When the Internet was introduced, {{there were}} {{comparatively}} few websites, especially news websites. Today, new media technology’s drastic {{developments in the}} communications field have had {{a big impact on}} society at large. The development and larger availability of information and activities seem to offer people the opportunity of quick access, and systematically providing, in seconds, what would have previously taken months of perusing <b>newspaper</b> <b>stacks</b> of microfilm rolls (Deacon, 2007). These features supersede the more traditional print medium in terms of delivering news with immediacy and impact, and act as a powerful lure that continually draws readers. This paper investigates online consumer behaviour with regards to student perceptions of the trust and credibility of online news. From a survey of 1, 000 students of institutions of higher education in the Klang Valley, findings reveal that youth still rely on traditional media to obtain news. However, traditional media fails to provide sufficient information for youth so they resort to getting additional information from alternative news websites. Nevertheless, their level of trust in alternative news websites is based on how accurately these sites reflect the current scenario. Findings also reveal that students believe alternative news websites present different viewpoints, are more critical, have more in-depth analysis and are relatively free from interference. All these factors seemingly contribute to youth’s trust of the alternative news websites they read. What is interesting {{is the fact that the}} trust extends to alternative online news sources but excludes blogs and the findings clearly show that the youth are not weaned off of traditional media...|$|R
25|$|By 1825, {{the toilet}} {{had been removed}} and the {{bathroom}} space joined to the west bedchamber to create an office. This area {{was used for the}} President's office over the next several decades. Abraham Lincoln used it as both an office and a Cabinet room, and signed the Emancipation Proclamation in the room on January 1, 1863. During the Lincoln presidency, the walls were covered with Civil War maps. It had dark green wallpaper, and the carpeting was also dark green. <b>Newspapers</b> were <b>stacked</b> on the desk and tables along with large amounts of mail and requests from office seekers. Two large wicker wastebaskets were filled with debris. The east bedchamber was converted into an office for presidential aides, although President John Tyler used it as part of his office from 1841 to 1845.|$|R

50|$|The Chronicle {{originated}} as the Newcastle Chronicle, {{founded in}} 1764 as a weekly <b>newspaper</b> by Thomas <b>Stack.</b> The paper {{was owned by}} his descendants until 1850, when it was sold to a consortium led by Mark William Lambert, a local businessman. The repeal of the taxes on newspapers in 1855, along with the hiring of new journalists and the installation of a new printing press created an opportunity to expand the newspaper. On May 1, 1858, the Newcastle Daily Chronicle was launched. Its editor was Joseph Cowen, who became the sole owner {{at the end of}} 1859. He soon turned the Chronicle into the most successful newspaper in north-eastern England {{and one of the most}} successful provincial newspapers of the 19th century. In April 2013 the Evening Chronicle became known as The Chronicle or Chronicle Live.|$|R
40|$|There is {{only one}} book I reread on a regular basis. Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, {{published}} in 1980, {{is a story about}} drifting and loss and longing, of women existing in the world in an uneasy, awkward way. The idea of living in a house is foreign to the transient Aunt Sylvie and when she suddenly has {{to take care of her}} nieces, she manages to bring all her homeless habits indoors. She eats in the dark and sleeps on top of her covers and throws rocks at the neighbors’ dogs. My favorite is her collection of tin cans and <b>newspaper</b> <b>stacks</b> invading the living room— instead of sweeping, her idea of housework is accumulation, small measurements of time. Housekeeping reminds me that difference lies in the most ordinary of things. No single thing Sylvie does is very strange, but taken together her habits set her apart; her dedication to impermanence has no place in the concrete, didactic world of the ordinary. And so, she doesn’t stay. She keeps moving and finding new places to live, happy to keep shifting what she wants as she finds it. I think of this show similarly. Each painting is a place of rest from a world that is otherwise. Much of my work is influenced by literature because I can connect characters and moods from various stories in a non-linear way. Reading builds the continuity of women’s experience I draw from and think about when I’m painting. Interviews with feminist authors and artists are just as influential. I am interested in how women can push back and question their roles in the wider world through announcing difference and separation. I think the writer Ursula K. Le Guin said it best: “On the maps drawn by men there is an immense white area, terra incognita, where most women live. That is all yours to explore, to inhabit, to describe. ” And this is where I’m coming from, my little Antarctica of female collective presence. It’s a world I know by feeling only, a place I discover and create simultaneously. This exhibition is a marked contrast to my previous work that included disparate components together in one painting. I’d use abstraction, landscapes, figures, collage, ornamentation and text all at once. The term “horror vacui” or “fear of open space” was used regularly to describe this earlier, smaller work. Shifting to a much larger scale I see space differently, both mentally and physically. I pull things apart to see how fragments, given room to breathe, can be full of possibility. When painting I seek a balance of certainty and ambiguity so the work carries the fluidity of thought and interpretation is not fixed. I am interested in the inclusive nature of “both/and” rather than the exclusive “either/or. ” Creating the work, I set up various formal problems for myself by thinking about language. I dwell on words rendering women the lesser sex—passive, receiving, emotional, nurturing, domestic, decorative—in order to complicate the imagery. An oval lying on its side is full of vitality, not waiting, but scheming. A crocheted blanket becomes the grid. A barren field seduces like a cool blue pool. The undesired transforms into a graceful presence, with a new voice of authority and belonging.
