While Keynes's successors {{paid little attention to}} the probabilistic parts of his work, uncertainty may have played a central part in the investment and liquidity-preference aspects of General Theory.|$|E

The study used the experimental method. Hypothesis tested by Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney test. The result of the study stated {{there was a significant difference}} between stimuli of information about <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> of meat consumption on health, environment, social and ethics and control.

5|$|The book {{argues that}} artists have been scapegoated by those advocating censorship, {{as a method}} of {{deflecting}} debate away from the suppression of human rights. The author asserts that censorship of works deemed obscene {{has been used as a}} tactic throughout history to suppress women's rights. Heins argues that even if the perceived <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> of pornography,hip hop music, and violent films were factually accurate (and she asserts they are not), the ends would not justify the means of degrading the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She emphasizes that education should be used to help guard against potentially dangerous notions, instead of censorship and suppression of dissent.|$|E
5|$|Whitebark pine {{communities}} have been heavily damaged {{due to the}} effects of blister rust, a non native fungus. In Glacier and the surrounding region, 30% of the whitebark pine trees have died and over 70% of the remaining trees are currently infected. The whitebark pine provides a high fat pine cone seed, commonly known as the pine nut, that is a favorite food of red squirrels and Clark's nutcracker. Both grizzlies and black bears are known to raid squirrel caches of pine nuts, one of the bears' favorite foods. Between 1930 and 1970, efforts to control the spread of blister rust were unsuccessful, and continued destruction of whitebark pines appears likely, with attendant <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> on dependent species.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, {{construction}} on the Central Arizona Project (CAP) began while many of its facilities were still being planned and approved. One {{integral part of the}} project was a storage dam on the Salt River, Orme Dam. However, in 1977, US President Jimmy Carter recommended that Orme Dam and two other projects on the Gila River System be removed from the CAP plan because of their <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> and cost. While the two other projects (Hooker and Charleston Dam) were easily removed, Orme was not. Orme's removal was hampered by controversy that {{led to the creation of}} the Central Arizona Water Control Study (CAWCS) in 1979 after Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus requested that the Bureau of Reclamation identify a replacement. In 1980, the CAWCS recommended the removal of any storage units on the Gila River. Recent flooding within the CAWCS area and the Orme Dam problem led to an expansion of the study to include dams for flood control.|$|E
5|$|Journal The Library Quarterly {{published}} an article by Eliza T. Dresang which classed Not in Front of the Children as an effective treatise on the harmful to minors doctrine. Dresang wrote that Heins had successfully shown that this doctrine, which served as the core basis for legislation including the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), was demonstrably impossible to prove. She concluded that Heins concisely argued censorship of works from the reach of children can have <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> on their level of innovation, healthy mental growth, and adaptive abilities. Writing in English Journal, Tonya Perry discussed the work and emphasized that if the motivation behind children's education was to produce independent critical thinkers, {{it was necessary to}} extend the limits of censorship.|$|E
5|$|Several {{conservation}} {{measures have been}} undertaken or proposed to protect this species. Inaccessible Island was once suggested as a site for agriculture for Tristan Islanders, which would have reduced habitat and risked the introduction of invasive species. However the island was declared a nature reserve by the Tristan da Cunha Island Council in 1994. Access to the island is restricted now, although Tristan Islanders are still permitted to visit the island to collect firewood and guano. Introduced New Zealand flax {{has been removed from}} the island, and the island now has a management plan. Other suggestions for securing this species' future include increased education on biosecurity for the local community, and potentially setting up a captive population. It has also been suggested that backup populations be established on other secure islands, for example Nightingale Island, in case predators reached Inaccessible Island, but this may have <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> on the endemic invertebrate faunas of these islands.|$|E

5|$|C.maenas is a predator, {{feeding on}} many organisms, {{particularly}} bivalve molluscs (such as clams, oysters, and mussels), polychaetes and small crustaceans. They are primarily nocturnal, although activity {{also depends on}} the tide, and crabs can be active {{at any time of}} day. In California, preferential predation of C.maenas on native clams (Nutricola spp.) resulted in the decline of the native clams and an increase of a previously introduced clam (the amethyst gem clam, Gemma gemma). C.maenas has been implicated in the destruction of the soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria) fisheries on the east coast of the United States and Canada, and the reduction of populations of other commercially important bivalves (such as scallops, Argopecten irradians, and northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria). The prey of C.maenas includes the young of bivalves and fish, although the effect of its predation on winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus is minimal. C.maenas can, however, have substantial <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> on local commercial and recreational fisheries, by preying on the young of species, such as oysters and the Dungeness crab, or competing with them for resources.|$|E
5|$|Malta's tourism {{industry}} faces {{a number of}} issues impacting on it now and threatening to impact on it in the future. One of the clearest issues facing Malta's {{tourism industry}} is overcrowding {{as a result of the}} island nation's relatively small size, in terms of both area and population. Malta is a nation of just under 450,000 people, yet its infrastructure is required to support over 1.1 million tourists every year. Malta's water works, roads, waste management systems and beaches are stretched to capacity in the summer months of July and August of every year, when tourism numbers are at their peak. This is a challenge facing Maltese tourism operators as it means that they cannot simply pursue the kinds of 'mass tourism' marketing measures taken by operators in other Mediterranean destinations with more space and resources to pursue them. In addition, Maltese tourism operators must balance increased tourism numbers with the needs of the 'native population', as when resources are stretched thin by tourists during the summer season, there are <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> on Maltese residents also.|$|E
