5|$|Even so, {{there is}} <b>no</b> <b>shortage</b> of {{criticism}} against Beyonce's particular brand of feminism. Many {{critics argue that}} Beyonce {{is part of the}} hyper sexualization of women in the pop industry since the 90's, something that occurred largely in sync with the explosion of the porn industry. Beyond this, some feminist critics argue that Beyonce fuels a culture of post-feminism. With songs like Girls (Who Run the World), Beyonce creates a mindset - particularly among teenage girls - that women are already outdoing men in every aspect of life. When the reality is, these critics say, there are still vast gender inequalities that keep them from doing so. The danger of post-feminism is that while they still exist, young people lack the language to label these inequalities as sexism.|$|E
5|$|With no {{resources}} available from either Congress or the Continental Army, Irvine gave permission for volunteers to organize their own offensive. Detroit {{was too far}} and too strong for a small-scale operation, but militiamen such as David Williamson believed that an expedition against the American Indian towns on the Sandusky River was feasible. It {{was to be a}} low-budget campaign. Each volunteer had to provide at his expense a horse, rifle, ammunition, rations, and other equipment. Their only payment would be an exemption from two months of militia duty, plus whatever plunder might be taken from the Indians. Because of ongoing Indian raids—the wife and children of a Baptist minister were killed and scalped in western Pennsylvania on May 12, 1782—there was <b>no</b> <b>shortage</b> of men willing to volunteer.|$|E

The approach does not require a precise knowledge of the probability distribution of the moment of obsolescence, as is the case for models discussed in the literature.

30|$|Roy and Chaudhuri (2011) {{introduced}} an economic production lot-sized model where {{the production rate}} depends on the stock and selling price per unit. In this model, deterioration is assumed as a constant fraction allowing <b>no</b> <b>shortages.</b> Balkhi and Bakry (2009) devised a dynamic inventory model of deteriorating items in which each of the production, demand and deterioration rates were assumed to be general functions of time. Both inflation and time value of money were incorporated, and the optimal stopping and restarting production times in any cycle could be determined.|$|R

The lack of bank credit forced them to buy raw materials at exorbitant prices while they had to sell their products at depressed prices and forego expansion.|$|E

This appreciation meant that Brazilian goods were now more expensive relative to goods from other countries, which contributed to large current account deficits. However, <b>no</b> <b>shortage</b> of foreign currency ensued because of the financial community's renewed interest in Brazilian markets as inflation rates stabilized and memories of the debt crisis of the 1980s faded.|$|E
