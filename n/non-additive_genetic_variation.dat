40|$|Conventionally, Eucalyptus grandis x E. urophylla (GU) hybrid {{material}} has first been tested as seedlings in progeny trials {{for at least}} four years before ortets were selected and ramets of the selected ortets were propagated to test in clonal trials. The primary constraint with this “conventional hybrid breeding strategy” (CHBS) is the time required to first test the hybrid material as seedlings. In order to address this, an “accelerated hybrid breeding strategy” (AHBS) was investigated to reduce the time spend on testing GU hybrid material as seedlings. However, it is of utmost importance to quantify the impact the AHBS might have on genetic gains and genetic information. With this in mind, two clonal populations have been established with genetic material that derived from the CHBS and the AHBS. The main {{purpose of this study is}} therefore to do a comparative study between the CHBS and AHBS to firstly quantify the genetic gains per unit time for GU hybrid clonal populations that have been derived from the CHBS and AHBS respectively; and secondly to obtain genetic parameters such as heritabilities, the ratio of dominance, clonal within family variance and the proportion of additive and non-additive genetic variance. The results of our study indicated that the percentage realised volume gains per year was higher for the AHBS (3. 7 %) than for the CHBS (1. 9 %) when compared to the GU commercial clone. Thus, shortening the testing time of GU seedlings had a positive impact on volume gains per year. With regards to genetic parameters, both the AHBS and CHBS clonal populations indicated that <b>non-additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> explained majority (88 % and 71 % respectively) of the genetic variation. Due to the pre-eminence of <b>non-additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>variation,</b> the narrow sense heritabilties for the female and male effects were negligible for both clonal populations. Overall, the majority of the <b>non-additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> was explained by the proportion of dominance variance, and less by the clone within family effect. These results suggest that: firstly the time spend on testing GU hybrid material as seedlings should be minimised; and secondly a hybrid breeding strategy to capture <b>non-additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> should be adopted.

We then assessed the accuracy of genomic prediction of additive compared to total (additive plus non-additive) genetic value. We confirmed previous findings based on diallel populations, that <b>non-additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> is significant, especially for yield traits. Further, we show that we total genetic value correlated more strongly to observed phenotypes than did additive value, although this is constrained by low broad-sense heritability and is not beneficial for traits with already high heritability.

However, studies analyzing only twins are very {{limited in their}} ability to detect <b>non-additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> and are unable to detect sources of variation unique to twins, which can mask <b>non-additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>variation.</b> The current study assessed 9672 MZ and DZ twin individuals and 3241 of their siblings to investigate the environmental and genetic architecture underlying eight dimensions of personality: four from Eysenck 2 ̆ 7 s Personality Questionnaire and four from Cloninger 2 ̆ 7 s Temperament and Character Inventory. Broad-sense heritability estimates from best-fitting models were two to three times greater than the narrow-sense heritability estimates for Harm Avoidance, Novelty Seeking, Reward Dependence, Persistence, Extraversion, and Neuroticism. This genetic non-additivity could be due to dominance, additive-by-additive epistasis, or to additive genetic effects combined with higher-order epistasis. Environmental effects unique to twins were detected for both Lie and Psychoticism but accounted for little overall variation. Our results illustrate the increased sensitivity afforded by extending the classical twin design to include siblings, and may provide clues to the evolutionary origins of genetic variation underlying personality...|$|E

40|$|The current E. grandis x E. urophylla hybrid {{breeding}} {{strategy of}} South Africa’s Forestry Industry {{is to maintain}} large breeding populations of both parental species in which parents are selected based on their general combining ability (GCA) estimates or predicted individual tree breeding values and are used for interspecific hybrid crosses. The hybrid material is first screened in seedling progeny trials after which superior individuals are selected and tested as clones. Although this strategy has delivered superior clones for commercial production in South Africa, {{it is a time}} consuming strategy to follow and more cost effective strategies are being investigated. In order to review the current hybrid breeding strategy, information on the genetic control of the traits of interest is needed for E. grandis x E. urophylla seedling and clonal populations. The main objectives of this study were therefore to firstly estimate genetic parameters for E. grandis x E. urophylla hybrid seedling and clonal populations; secondly to investigate the correlation between E. grandis and E. urophylla parental (GCA) or individual breeding values and their general hybridising ability (GHA); and lastly to determine the correlation between E. grandis x E. urophylla hybrid seedling ortets and their ramets. Results of our study indicated that <b>non-additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> explained the majority of the total genetic variation in E. grandis x E. urophylla seedling and clonal populations. Due to the pre-eminence of non-additive variance, the pure-hybrid correlations were weak, especially for clonal populations. It would therefore seem that GCA or predicted individual breeding values are not good predictors of GHA for growth performance in the observed populations. Our study also indicated a weak coefficient of correlation between the growth performance of seedling ortets and their ramets. These results suggest that: firstly a hybrid breeding strategy to capture <b>non-additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> should be adopted; and secondly that the first phase of screening E. grandis x E. urophylla hybrid material as seedlings should be revisited.

40|$|Abstract Background Quantifying {{the amount}} of {{standing}} <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> in fitness represents an empirical challenge. Unfortunately, the shortage of detailed studies of the genetic architecture of fitness has hampered progress in several domains of evolutionary biology. One such area {{is the study of}} sexual selection. In particular, the evolution of adaptive female choice by indirect genetic benefits relies on the presence of <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> for fitness. Female choice by genetic benefits fall broadly into good genes (additive) models and compatibility (non-additive) models where the strength of selection is dictated by the genetic architecture of fitness. To characterize the genetic architecture of fitness, we employed a quantitative genetic design (the diallel cross) in a population of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, which is known to exhibit post-copulatory female choice. From reciprocal crosses of inbred lines, we assayed egg production, egg-to-adult survival, and lifetime offspring production of the outbred F 1 daughters (F 1 productivity). Results We used the bio model to estimate six components of genetic and environmental variance in fitness. We found sizeable additive and <b>non-additive</b> <b>genetic</b> variance in F 1 productivity, but lower genetic variance in egg-to-adult survival, which was strongly influenced by maternal and paternal effects. Conclusion Our results show that, in order to gain a relevant understanding of the genetic architecture of fitness, measures of offspring fitness should be inclusive and should include quantifications of offspring reproductive success. We note that our estimate of additive genetic variance in F 1 productivity (CV A = 14 %) is sufficient to generate indirect selection on female choice. However, our results also show that the major determinant of offspring fitness is the genetic interaction between parental genomes, as indicated by large amounts of <b>non-additive</b> <b>genetic</b> variance (dominance and/or epistasis) for F 1 productivity. We discuss the processes that may maintain additive and <b>non-additive</b> <b>genetic</b> variance for fitness and how these relate to indirect selection for female choice. </p...|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2001 The Genetics Society of Great Britain. Human dental crowns {{are complex}} {{structures}} without simple genetic or environmental determination, but mathematical modelling {{of data from}} family studies is now providing a more complete picture of their ontogeny. Mesiodistal (MD) and buccolingual (BL) dental crown diameters were recorded from almost 600 monozygotic and dizygotic twins, and univariate biometrical models were fitted to the data for 28 permanent teeth (excluding third molars). All 56 variables showed significant contributions of additive genetic variation, varying from 56 to 92 % of phenotypic variation, with most being over 80 %. The effects of individual or unique environment ranged from 8 to 29 %. A significant effect of the environment shared by twins — either uterine or early childhood — was found for MD and BL diameters of maxillary first molars (22 – 27 %). There were also significant levels of <b>non-additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> in MD diameters of canines and first premolars, {{which is consistent with}} selective pressures acting on these teeth at some stage in human evolution.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to investigate the heritability of breast size {{and the degree to which}} this heritability is shared with BMI. In a sample of 1010 females twins (mean age 35 years; SD = 2. 1; range 28 - 40), self-report data pertaining to bra cup size and body mass index (BMI) was collected in the context of self-report data and an interview relating to disordered eating respectively. In a sample of 348 complete twin pairs who completed data collection (226 MZ pairs and 122 DZ pairs and 360 incomplete pairs (170 MZ and 190 DZ)), we found that the heritability of bra cup size was 56 %. Of this genetic variance, one third is in common with genes influencing body mass index, and two thirds (41 % of total variance) is unique to breast size, with some directional evidence of <b>non-additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>variation.</b> The implications of these findings with respect to previous research linking breast size with reproductive potential are discussed. © Copyright 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that females of the field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus exercise post-copulatory choice over the paternity of their offspring. There is evidence that these choices are made in relation to the genetic compatibility of mates rather than their absolute quality, but the magnitude of heritable differences in males has not been thoroughly examined. Using a half-sib breeding design we measured additive genetic variance and dam effects in a suite of reproductive and non-reproductive traits. Both components explained relatively little of the phenotypic variance across traits. The dam component in our design contains variance caused by both maternal effects and dominance. If maternal effects are negligible as suggested by previous studies, our data suggest that dominance variance is an important source of variation in these traits. The lack of additive genetic variation, but possible existence of large amounts of <b>non-additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> is consistent with the idea that female mate choice and multiple mating may be driven by differences in genetic compatibility between potential mates rather than by differences in genetic quality...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a statistical approach which incorporates pedigree {{information in the}} form of relationship matrices into the analysis of standard agricultural genetic trials, where elite lines are tested. Allowing for the varying levels of inbreeding of the lines which occur in these types of trials, the approach involves the partitioning of the genetic effect of lines into additive <b>genetic</b> effects and <b>non-additive</b> <b>genetic</b> effects. The current methodology for creating relationship matrices is developed and in particular an approach to create the dominance matrix under full inbreeding in a more efficient manner is presented. A new method for creating the dominance matrix assuming no inbreeding is also presented. The application of the approach to the single site analyses of wheat breeding trials is shown. The wheat lines evaluated in these trials are inbred lines so that the total genetic effect of each of the lines is partitioned into an additive genetic effect and an epistatic genetic effect. Multi-environment trial analysis is also explored through the application of the approach to a sugarcane breeding trial. The sugarcane lines are hybrids and therefore the total genetic effect of each hybrid is partitioned into an additive genetic effect, a heterozygous dominance genetic effect and a residual <b>non-additive</b> <b>genetic</b> effect. Finally, the approach for inbred lines is examined in a simulations study where the levels of heritability and the <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> as a proportion of total trial variation is explored in single site analyses.

40|$|Abstract: Seven Egyptian cotton genotypes were crossed using scaling test {{analysis}} {{during summer}} 2004 to 2005 and evaluated in 2006 summer {{season at the}} Agricultural Experimental Farm of Al-Alzhar University, Assiut. The experiment was grown in a Randomized Complete Blocks Design with three replications. The means of the six generations; P 1, P 2, F 1,F 2, BC 1 and BC 2 of four cotton crosses recorded for days to 50 % flowering, first fruiting per plant, no. of fruiting branches per plant, days to 50 % maturity, no. of open bolls per plant, boll weight, seed-cotton yield per plant, lint yield per plant and lint percentage, were subjected to scaling test and six parameters method to detect epistasis and estimates of m, d, h, i, j and L parameters. Results showed that the additive- dominance model was adequate to demonstrate the <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> and it important in the inheritance of most studied traits. Non-allelic gene interaction was operating in the control of <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> in most studied traits. The epiststic effects, additive x additive [i] and dominance x dominance [h] were highly significant in most cases. The signs of (h) and (L) were opposite in all studied traits for most crosses. Also, the inheritance of all studied traits was controlled by additive and <b>non-additive</b> <b>genetic</b> effects, but dominance gene effects play the major role in controlling the <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> of the most studied traits. Significant negative heterosis relative to mid-parents was found for both characters, first fruiting branch per plant and days to 50 % maturity in all crosses while, significant negative heterosis above the better parent was found for first fruitin...|$|R
40|$|Ornamental {{secondary}} sexual {{traits are}} hypothesized to evolve {{in response to}} directional mating preferences for more ornamented mates. Such mating preferences may themselves evolve partly because ornamentation indicates an individual's additive genetic quality (good genes). While mate choice can also confer <b>non-additive</b> <b>genetic</b> benefits (compatible genes), {{the identity of the}} most ‘compatible’ mate is assumed to depend on the choosy individual's own genotype. It is therefore unclear how choice for <b>non-additive</b> <b>genetic</b> benefits could contribute to directional mating preferences and consequently the evolution of ornamentation. In free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia), individual males varied in their kinship with the female population. Furthermore, a male's song repertoire size, a secondary sexual trait, was negatively correlated with kinship such that males with larger repertoires were less closely related to the female population. After excluding close relatives as potential mates, individual females were on average less closely related to males with larger repertoires. Therefore, female song sparrows expressing directional preferences for males with larger repertoires would on average acquire relatively unrelated mates and produce relatively outbred offspring. Such <b>non-additive</b> <b>genetic</b> fitness benefits of directional mating preferences, which may reflect genetic dominance variance expressed in structured populations, should be incorporated into genetic models of sexual selection...|$|R
