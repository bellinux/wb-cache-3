Shreyas Talpade proves that (his previous film), Iqbal was <b>no</b> <b>accident</b> and Gul Panag gives {{one of the most}} convincing portrayals of her career. But, it is Ayesha Takia who simply blows your breath away. Her journey from joyous subjugation — where she is content to dance before her husband and be at the beck and call of her in-laws — to silent emancipation is absolutely endearing.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald was {{considered}} one of his province's most eloquent political orators. He articulated a philosophy of provincial autonomy, arguing that poorer provinces needed a greater share of national tax revenues to pay for health, education and welfare. He contended that Nova Scotians were victims of a national policy that protected the industries of Ontario and Quebec with steep tariffs forcing people to pay higher prices for manufactured goods. It was <b>no</b> <b>accident,</b> Macdonald said, that Nova Scotia had gone from the richest province per capita before Canadian Confederation in 1867 to poorest by the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|The {{political}} {{context of the}} event, coupled {{with a variety of}} curious circumstances (for instance, the Russian agent Kim Philby was head of counter-intelligence for MI6 in Gibaltar at the time), immediately gave rise to numerous speculation that Sikorski's death had been <b>no</b> <b>accident,</b> and may have been the direct result of a Soviet, British, or even Polish conspiracy. Some modern sources note that the accident is not fully explained However, as Roman Wapiński noted in his biographical entry on Sikorski in the Polish Biographical Dictionary in 1997, no conclusive evidence of any wrongdoing has been found, and Sikorski's official cause of death is listed as an accident.|$|E

The Narcissus story tells of love corrupted by inward-looking selfishness, rather than by jealousy. It may be <b>no</b> <b>accident</b> that the Youth in the poem has connections to flower-imagery (the Narcissus being the Wild Daffodil).|$|E

25|$|Although {{conversion}} {{was not as}} rapid as Ismail’s forcible policies might suggest, {{the vast}} majority of those who lived in the territory of what is now Iran and Azerbaijan did identify with Shiism {{by the end of the}} Safavid era in 1722. Thus, the population of Azerbaijan was forcibly converted to Shiism in the early 16th century at the same time as the people of what is nowadays Iran, when the Safavids held sway over it. Hence it is <b>no</b> <b>accident</b> that in Iran and Azerbaijan, today's Sunni minorities are concentrated among the country’s non-Persian and non-Azerbaijani ethnic groups that are scattered along the country’s borders, with their Sunni co-nationals next door.|$|E
25|$|In late 1935, {{he turned}} to Frank C. Bennett, then President of Bennett Oil Corporation, President of Federal Oil of Houston, Texas, and Vice-President of Bennett Oil and Gas of Lake Charles, Louisiana. Merrill's choice of Bennett as an {{investor}} was <b>no</b> <b>accident</b> or stroke of luck, as {{he knew that it}} was common for oil companies to invest in the development of airplanes, and frequently sponsored flights and other events to highlight the performance of their products. After Merrill’s convincing presentation, Bennett joined Merrill in forming the Bennett Aircraft Corporation of Wilmington, Delaware. The aircraft was to be a twin-engine (called bimotored in the 1930s), eight-place mid-wing monoplane with a conventional tail unit and retractable landing gear. It was powered by two wing-mounted Jacobs L-6 engines. The passenger cabin for six passengers was behind the two-crew flight deck.|$|E

25|$|That the {{bodywork}} enclosing all of Chapman's {{innovative technology}} was similar in appearance to the Vanwall Grand Prix cars was <b>no</b> <b>accident,</b> as both cars had been sculpted by pioneer automotive aerodynamacist Frank Costin. As {{with many of}} Lotus's competition cars, the aluminium used to construct the bodywork was extremely thin and offered {{little in the way}} of support for the underlying chassis members. The car was extremely low and compact, with the bonnet barely reaching the same height as the tops of the front wheels, despite the smaller diameters used from the 1959 season onward. The driver sat in a slightly reclined position — nowhere near as extremely inclined as Chapman would later inflict upon his pilots but still unusual for its day — and behind the driver rose a stubby rear fin, incorporating the fuel tank.|$|E

Yubari is kidnapped and held on the Renegade, but manages to escape, kidnapping Brahms in turn. While trying to restore a deleted isolinear chip, Rol shoots Lorhrok, apparently {{under the influence of}} an external force. As she lays dying, Cortez promotes Dovan to full commander, gives him co-ordinates to follow and mentions Dexter Remmick (Episode #203). While interrogating Brahms, Dovan reveals Cortez' heading to be 114 mark 388 mark 8 in the Delta Quadrant. Brahms' forces break him out of the Excelsior 's brig, but Rol remains behind to deliver a message to Dovan (Episode #204).|$|E
25|$|The {{classic example}} of {{targeted}} development is imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), a small molecule which inhibits a signaling molecule kinase. The genetic abnormality causing chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) {{has been known for}} a long time to be a chromosomal translocation creating an abnormal fusion protein, kinase BCR-ABL, which signals aberrantly, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of the leukemia cells. Imatinib precisely inhibits this kinase. Unlike so many other anti-cancer agents, this pharmaceutical was <b>no</b> <b>accident.</b> Brian Druker, working in Oregon Health & Science University, had extensively researched the abnormal enzyme kinase in CML. He reasoned that precisely inhibiting this kinase with a drug would control the disease and have little effect on normal cells. Druker collaborated with Novartis chemist Nicholas Lydon, who developed several candidate inhibitors. From these, imatinib was found to have the most promise in laboratory experiments. First Druker and then other groups worldwide demonstrated that when this small molecule is used to treat patients with chronic-phase CML, 90% achieve complete haematological remission. It is hoped that molecular targeting of similar defects in other cancers will have the same effect.|$|E

500|$|In 1943 a British Court of Inquiry {{investigated}} {{the crash of}} Sikorski's Liberator II AL523, {{but was unable to}} determine the probable cause, finding only that it was an accident and the [...] "aircraft became uncontrollable for reasons which cannot be established". A popular theory was insufficient technical maintenance leading to jamming aircraft controls. Despite this finding, the political context of the event, coupled with a variety of curious circumstances, immediately gave rise to speculation that Sikorski's death had been <b>no</b> <b>accident,</b> and may in fact have been the direct result of a Soviet, British or even Polish conspiracy.|$|E

500|$|Leading {{up to the}} 1986 elections, it {{was unclear}} whether Mathias would seek a fourth term. His support of President Reagan was lukewarm, which had further {{isolated}} him ideologically from his Republican colleagues. One delegate at the Maryland state party convention had even called Mathias [...] "liberal swine" [...] for his record. Additionally, his frequent difficulties in securing a committee chairmanship along with his low attendance rate were raising questions regarding his ability. However, Mathias was showing signs of seeking re-election in 1985, and dismissed any claims of ineffectiveness. Mathias claimed [...] "within a matter of minutes, I can talk to any member of the Cabinet; and I could go see them within 24 hours....
