5000|$|Structural {{properties}} {{can also}} be used to distinguish between various hybrid materials. An organic moiety containing a functional group that allows the attachment to an inorganic network, e.g. a trialkoxysilane group, can act as a <b>network</b> <b>modifier</b> because in the final structure the inorganic network is only modified by the organic group. Phenyltrialkoxysilanes are an example for such compounds; they modify the silica network in the sol-gel process via the reaction of the trialkoxysilane group without supplying additional functional groups intended to undergo further chemical reactions to the material formed. If a reactive functional group is incorporated the system is called a network functionalizer. The situation is different if two or three of such anchor groups modify an organic segment; this leads to materials in which the inorganic group is afterwards an integral part of the hybrid network. The latter type of system is known as network builder ...|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of Ga-La-S glass consists of Ga-S bonds, with {{a length of}} 2.26 Å, and La-S bonds of length 2.93 Å. It {{has been reported that}} the Ga-S bond lengths in the glassy state are identical to those in the crystalline state. Therefore, it is only necessary to change the bond angles and, thus, it is hypothesised that Ga-La-S {{has the potential to be}} a fast switching phase change memory material. In the Ga2S3 crystal shown in (figure 2 below) it should be noticed that two out of three sulfur atoms (S1 and S2) are each bound to three gallium atoms. These sulfur atoms have two normal covalent bonds to two of the gallium atoms. The third Ga-S bond is dative or coordinate covalent (one of the atoms provides both electrons). The third sulfur atom, S3, is bound to just two gallium atoms and is thought to be a bridging atom. The average sulfur coordination number is greater than two; sulfide glasses usually have coordination numbers less than two. Experimentally, Ga2S3 has not been observed in a glassy state. There exists however a GaS4 unit within the Ga-S crystal which has been noted as the glass former. The La-S bond is ionic and likely to be a <b>network</b> <b>modifier.</b> By adding an ionic sulfide to the crystal, like La2S3, it is possible to modify the crystalline Ga2S3 into a vitreous structure. Of all the rare-earth sulfides, lanthanum gives the largest range of vitreous compositions. The effect of adding an ionic sulfide modifier such as a La2S3 molecule to the crystal is to break one of the Ga-S dative bonds and replace it with a S2− anion. This anion links the gallium atom such that its tetrahedral environment is not altered, but what was a tricoordinated S atom now becomes a dicoordinated bridging atom. This process creates a negative void which can then be filled by a La3+ cation. Electrically, the effect of adding La2S3 is to give the glass an essentially ionic character.|$|E

40|$|Amorphous SiO 2 (a-SiO 2) {{thermally}} annealed in {{an oxygen}} atmosphere incorporates oxygen molecules (O 2) in interstitial voids. When the thermal annealing is performed in 18 O 2 gas, interstitial 18 O 2 {{as well as}} interstitial 16 O 18 O and 16 O 2 are formed due to the oxygen exchange with the a-SiO 2 network. The a 1 Δg(v= 0) →X 3 Σg-(v= 1) infrared photoluminescence band of interstitial O 2 was utilized to quantitatively analyze the oxygen exchange, {{taking into account the}} influences of common <b>network</b> <b>modifiers</b> in synthetic a-SiO 2 (SiOH, SiF, and SiCl groups). The presence of <b>network</b> <b>modifiers</b> does not significantly change the average rate of 18 O transfer from interstitial O 2 to the a-SiO 2 network and its activation energy, suggesting that the <b>network</b> <b>modifiers</b> themselves do not serve as preferential oxygen exchange sites. When the concentration of SiOH groups is low, the oxygen exchange rate is distributed, indicating that {{only a small part of}} the network oxygen atoms participates in the oxygen exchange. However, the distribution of the oxygen exchange rate is distinctly narrow in the sample with high SiOH concentration. It is attributed to the redistribution of the network 18 O atoms and the modification of the a-SiO 2 network topology caused by reactions with mobile interstitial water molecules, which are transiently formed by dehydroxylation of paired SiOH groups. The activation energy for the average oxygen exchange rate is larger than that of the permeation of interstitial O 2 in a-SiO 2. Furthermore, the average exchange-free diffusion length of interstitial O 2 below 900 [*]°C (≳ 1 μm) is far larger than the scale of the interstitial voids in a-SiO 2 (≲ 1 nm). These observations confirm that the oxygen exchange is not necessarily involved in the permeation of interstitial O 2...|$|R

Variation of $Mo^{ 5 +}$ concentration as a function of PbO concentration has also been studied using ESR spectroscopy. A structural model is presented to rationalize the experimental observations. According to this model, binary phosphomolybdate glasses are built up of $[Mo 0 _{ 6 / 2 }]$ octahedral and $[POO_{ 3 / 2 }]$ tetrahedral units which share corner Further, PbO plays a dual strutural role, both as a network former and as a <b>network</b> <b>modifier.</b> This aspect is discussed in the light of various experimental results.

40|$|Femtosecond {{laser pulse}} {{irradiation}} of inorganic glasses allows a selective {{modification of the}} optical properties with very high precision. This results in the possibility {{for the production of}} three-dimensional functional optical elements in the interior of glass materials, such as optical data storage, waveguide writing, etc. The influence of the chemical glass composition to the response upon ultrashort laser irradiation has not been studied systematically. For that, simple silicabased model glasses composed of systematically varying alkaline- and earth-alkaline components were prepared, irradiated on the surface and in the volume with single fs-laser pulses (∼ 130 fs, 800 nm), and were subsequently analyzed by means of micro-Raman spectroscopy and quantitative phase contrast microscopy in order to account for changes in the glass structure and for alterations of the optical refractive index, respectively. The Raman spectroscopic studies of the laser-irradiated spots revealed no change in the average binding configuration (the so called Q-structure), but local changes of bond-angles and bond-lengths within the glass structure structure. Those changes are explained by structural relaxation of the glass network due to densification caused by a transient laser-induced plasma generation and the following shock wave and other thermal phenomena. Glasses with a low amount of <b>network</b> <b>modifiers</b> show changes in the Si-O network while glasses with a high amount of <b>network</b> <b>modifiers</b> react primarily via variation of the nonbridging oxygen ions.

The excitation spectra are {{shown to be}} superpositions of two primary spectra, which are identified with T 1 + acting as network modifiers or as charge compensators for network aluminums. When Al/Na ≥ 1, only the charge compensator spectrum can be observed.

These results strongly support the traditional model of alkali aluminosilicate structure, in which the critical compositions for (dis) appearance of nonbridging oxygens are given by Al/Na = 1; they contradict reports of XPS measurements from which it had been concluded that the critical compositions are given by Al/Na ≈ 0. 7.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} microstructures of several glasses by {{measuring}} the Young's modulus and internal friction {{as a function of}} temperature, using the impulse excitation technique (IET). IET is based on the analysis of the resonant vibration of a solid material sample, induced by an impulse excitation. IET determines the mechanical resonant frequencies (f(x)) from which the elastic moduli can be calculated, and for each f(x) the corresponding internal friction (Q(- 1)). It was found that the stiffness of quartz and borosilicate glasses increases with temperature. The stiffness of soda-lime and alumino-silicate glasses decreases with the increase of temperature. The change of stiffness of quartz and aluminosilicate glasses during heat-treatment is reversible, but that of borosilicate and soda-lime glasses is not. Explanations for the irreversibility are suggested based on the Q (1) -features of the glasses. Diffusion of <b>network</b> <b>modifier</b> ions in the glass network holes is proposed to cause a non-reversible stiffness change, whereas localised anelastic relaxation of <b>network</b> <b>modifier</b> ions leads to a reversible stiffness change.
