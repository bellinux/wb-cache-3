5|$|Acadia's border was not {{formally}} demarcated by the Treaty of Utrecht, {{which became a}} cause of ongoing friction between the British and French, especially on the Isthmus of Chignecto, which both sides eventually fortified.

This helped the Amerindians of Abenaquis, Malecites, and MicMacs to retain their sovereignty over their old hunting grounds.|$|E
