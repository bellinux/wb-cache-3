[...] A week later, Gaahl and King delivered a statement claiming that it had been [...] "legally determined" [...] by the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>patent</b> <b>office</b> that they retained [...] "the rightful ownership and use of the name and logo, now and in the future." [...] After the Patent Office's first department had thus accepted King's Gorgoroth trademark application, King and Gaahl withdrew their application for the trademark of [...] "The Force Gorgoroth". The statement also declared that Gaahl and King had severed ties with Regain Records for [...] "their disloyal acts" [...] and were [...] "carefully choosing a new label for the release of their next full-length album." [...] Infernus subsequently declared that the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>patent</b> <b>office</b> decision would be appealed by Regain Records and himself.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Here {{we attempt}} to advance the {{understanding}} of the impact of co-locative factors on regional innovation performance. The objectives are to answer what role co-location plays in explaining differences in regional innovation performance and what methodological improvements can compensate for the shortcomings of existing econometric analyses. The study is based on register data from the Business Register of Statistics Norway and the patent data from the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>Office</b> for the period 1995 – 2003, aggregated to 161 labour market regions of Norway. A Bayesian spatial autoregressive (heteroscedastic) estimation procedure is applied. The results confirm the role of various co-locative factors in the spatial distribution of innovation.

50|$|Europe {{does not}} {{comprise}} a unitary patent system. European patent law is instead {{characterized by the}} coexistence of national patent systems, and thus national <b>patent</b> <b>offices,</b> and a European patent system associated with the European Patent Convention (EPC), {{in the context of}} which the European <b>Patent</b> <b>Office</b> (EPO) grants European patents through a central prosecution procedure. Enforcement of European patents are conducted and decided at a national level, i.e. before national courts. The <b>patent</b> <b>offices</b> in Europe therefore include, on the one hand, the plurality of national <b>patent</b> <b>offices</b> and, on the other hand, the European <b>Patent</b> <b>Office.</b> See also European patent law.|$|R
