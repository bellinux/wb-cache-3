5|$|The {{kingdom of}} East Anglia, (also {{known as the}} kingdom of the East Angles), was a small {{independent}} Anglo-Saxon kingdom that comprised what are now the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk and perhaps {{the eastern part of the}} Fens. The kingdom was one of the seven traditional members of the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. The East Angles were initially ruled (from the 6th century until 749) by members of the Wuffingas dynasty, named after Wuffa, whose <b>name</b> <b>means</b> 'descendants of the wolf'. The last king was Guthrum II, who ruled in the 10th century.|$|E
5|$|Reading may {{date back}} to the Roman {{occupation}} of Britain, possibly as a trading port for Calleva Atrebatum. However, the first clear evidence for Reading as a settlement dates from the 8th century, when the town {{came to be known as}} Readingum. The name probably comes from the Readingas, an Anglo-Saxon tribe whose <b>name</b> <b>means</b> Reada's People in Old English, or less probably the Celtic Rhydd-Inge, meaning Ford over the River. In late 870, an army of Danes invaded the kingdom of Wessex and set up camp at Reading. On 4 January 871, in the first Battle of Reading, King Ethelred and his brother Alfred the Great attempted unsuccessfully to breach the Danes' defences. The battle is described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and that account provides the earliest known written record of the existence of Reading. The Danes remained in Reading until late in 871, when they retreated to their winter quarters in London.|$|E
5|$|The name first {{appears in}} Saxon {{charters}} in around AD 880 as Cantuctun and two centuries {{later in the}} Domesday Book as Cantoctona and Cantetone. The <b>name</b> <b>means</b> settlement by a rim or circle of hills; Cantuc is Celtic for a rim or circle, and -ton or -tun is Old English for a settlement. The highest point of the hills is called Will's Neck meaning ridge of the Welshman, probably referring {{to a time when}} the hills marked the boundary between the expanding Saxon kingdom of Wessex and the lands of the Britons or 'Welsh' to the West. A battle was fought locally at that time.|$|E
