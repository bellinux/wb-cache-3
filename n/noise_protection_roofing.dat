The shielding effect of the photo-electric <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> wall was determined by noise level difference measurements in front of and behind the <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> wall, and was also calculated according to the Guidelines for <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> on streets (RLS- 90) {{and the results were}} compared. The installation damping dimension DE decisive for <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> on streets was calculated for the <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> wall examined and for a conventional <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> wall of the same height without photo-electrics according to (RLS- 90) and the results were also compared. Regarding the effect of the hard photo-electric surface to noise on the reflection behaviour of the <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> wall, <b>noise</b> level measurements were taken on the road side in front of the wall tested. The connection area of the photo-electric surface to be conventional <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> component was checked by measurement for being sound-proofSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 98 B 283 +a / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Bildung, Wissenschaft, Forschung und Technologie, Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|R

30|$|Due to {{the high}} noise {{emission}} generated by the gradients in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an efficient method of <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> is mandatory. In addition to providing hearing protection, appropriate headphone systems also serve to facilitate communication between the operator and the patient. However, in combined PET-MR devices, use of common pneumatic headphones, as delivered by the manufacturer, is problematic due to the potential generation of attenuation artefacts in the PET measurement. Furthermore, modern multichannel head coils rarely provide space for conventional headphones. This work presents an alternative system, which aims to address these limitations while still being appropriate for both patient <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> and communication in PET-MR.|$|R

The results of the field studies were used by the Regional Council of Leipzig (Germany) {{for the establishment of}} a <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> plan in the official approval process for the expansion of Leipzig/Halle airport. Methods and results of the DLR field study are described in detail. Special attention is given to the dose-response relationship between the maximum sound pressure level of an aircraft noise event and the probability to wake up, which was used to establish <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> zones directly related to the effects of noise on sleep. These protection zones differ qualitatively and quantitatively from zones that are solely based on acoustical criteria. The <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> plan for Leipzig/Halle airport is presented and substantiated: (1) on average, there should be less than one additional awakening induced by aircraft noise, (2) awakenings recalled in the morning should be avoided as much as possible, (3) aircraft noise should interfere as little as possible with the process of falling asleep again.

30|$|Due to {{the high}} level of noise {{generated}} by the gradient coils in the strong magnetic field during a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination, <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> for the patient is mandatory. Furthermore, to allow the operator to remain in direct communication with the patient during the examination, it is necessary for the patient to be able to hear the operator. <b>Noise</b> <b>protection</b> and communication are typically realised with the use of non-magnetic headphones, which are driven by air instead of electric or electronic components to ensure MR compatibility. In addition to the constraint of MR compatibility, the decreasing space in newer multichannel head coils means that space-saving solutions for the headphones are required. The headphones must not be visible by the MR and must not influence the image quality of the MR measurement.|$|R

40|$|Shrinking {{the feature}} size allows {{more and better}} {{functions}} on a single chip. However, it makes multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC) more susceptible to various reliability threats. Power supply noise is a major reliability problem faced by low power MPSoCs using power gating techniques. Powering on and off a processing unit in MPSoCs will induce large power/ground (P/G) noise and can cause timing divergence and even functional errors in surrounding processing units. Previous work on resilient architectures mainly focused on power/thermal management and neglected the important side-effect: P/G noise induced by power gating. In this paper, for the first time, we formulate a task scheduling problem with the consideration of P/G noise based on our detailed P/G noise analysis platform for MPSoC. Two efficient algorithms are proposed to reduce <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> penalty and improve MPSoC performance. Our experiments show that both simulated annealing and heuristic algorithms can achieve on average 25 % performance improvement together with up to 80 % <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> penalty saving compared with the conservative stop-go method for short tasks (shorter than 20 K clock cycles). For longer tasks up to 200 K clock cycles, the performance improvement of our methods will become relatively low. However, we can still achieve at least 35. 2 % <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> penalty saving. Furthermore, a lightweight online adjustment strategy accompanying the offline scheduling method is proposed to adapt to runtime variations and improve reliability...|$|R
