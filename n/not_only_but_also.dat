5|$|Doctor Who is {{not unique}} in its losses, as many {{broadcasters}} regularly cleared their archives in this manner. Until the BBC changed its archiving policy in 1978, thousands of hours of programming, in all genres, were deleted. Other affected BBC series include Dad's Army, Z-Cars, The Wednesday Play, Steptoe and Son, and <b>Not</b> <b>Only...</b> <b>But</b> <b>Also.</b> ITV regional franchises also deleted many programmes, including early videotaped episodes of The Avengers.|$|E
500|$|Thunderbirds has {{influenced}} TV programmes, films {{and various other}} media. The puppet comedy of the film [...] was directly inspired by the idiosyncrasies of Thunderbirds-era Supermarionation techniques. Allusion and homage are also evident in Wallace and Gromit: A Close Shave, [...] and Spaced, {{as well as the}} character design of [...] The BBC sketch comedy <b>Not</b> <b>Only...</b> <b>But</b> <b>Also</b> included a segment titled [...] "Superthunderstingcar"– a parody of Thunderbirds, Supercar and Stingray.|$|E
2500|$|Cook's comedy {{partnership}} with Dudley Moore led to <b>Not</b> <b>Only...</b> <b>But</b> <b>Also.</b> This was originally intended by the BBC {{as a vehicle}} for Moore's music, but Moore invited Cook to write sketches and appear with him. Using few props, they created dry, absurd television that proved hugely popular and lasted for three series between 1965 and 1970. Cook played characters such as Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling and the two men created their Pete and Dud alter egos. Other sketches included [...] "Superthunderstingcar", a parody of the Gerry Anderson marionette TV shows, and Cook's pastiche of 1960s trendy arts documentaries – satirised in a parodic segment on Greta Garbo.|$|E

2500|$|The Greek word [...] (...) {{refers to}} the {{ultimate}} source from which the proceeding occurs, but the Latin verb [...] (and the corresponding terms used to translate it into other languages) can apply also to proceeding through a mediate channel. Frederick Bauerschmidt notes that what Medieval theologians disregarded as minor objections about ambiguous terms, was in fact an [...] "insufficient understanding of the semantic difference" [...] between the Greek and Latin terms in both the East and the West. The West used the more generic Latin term [...] (to move forward; to come forth) which is more synonymous with the Greek term [...] (...) than the more specific Greek term [...] ( [...] , [...] "to issue forth as from an origin"). The West traditionally used one term and the East traditionally used two terms to convey arguably equivalent and complementary meaning, that is, [...] from the Father and [...] from the Son. Moreover, the more generic Latin term, , does not have [...] "the added implication of the starting-point of that movement; thus {{it is used to}} translate a number of other Greek theological terms." [...] It is used as the Latin equivalent, in the Vulgate, of <b>not</b> <b>only</b> , <b>but</b> <b>also</b> , and [...] (four times) and is used of Jesus' originating from God in , although at that time Greek [...] was already beginning to designate the Holy Spirit's manner of originating from the Father as opposed to that of the Son ( [...] — being born).|$|E
2500|$|The Pythons had a {{definite}} idea {{about what they}} wanted to do with the series. They were admirers of the work of Peter Cook, Alan Bennett, Jonathan Miller, and Dudley Moore on Beyond the Fringe, and had worked on Frost, which was similar in style. They enjoyed Cook and Moore's sketch show <b>Not</b> <b>Only...</b> <b>But</b> <b>Also.</b> One problem the Pythons perceived with these programmes was that though the body of the sketch would be strong, the writers would often struggle to then find a punchline funny enough to end on, and this would detract from the overall sketch quality. They decided that they would simply not bother to [...] "cap" [...] their sketches in the traditional manner, and early episodes of the Flying Circus series make great play of this abandonment of the punchline (one scene has Cleese turn to Idle, as the sketch descends into chaos, and remark that [...] "This is the silliest sketch I've ever been in"—they all resolve not to carry on and simply walk off the set). However, as they began assembling material for the show, the Pythons watched one of their collective heroes, Spike Milligan, recording his groundbreaking series Q5 (1969). Not only was the programme more irreverent and anarchic than any previous television comedy, but Milligan also would often [...] "give up" [...] on sketches halfway through and wander off set (often muttering [...] "Did I write this?"). It was clear that their new series would now seem less original, and Jones in particular became determined the Pythons should innovate.|$|E
