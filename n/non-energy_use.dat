40|$|To {{contribute}} to a more accurate accounting of CO 2 emissions originating from the <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> of fossil fuels, the <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> emission accounting tables (NEAT) model has been developed.

This paper describes the basic methodology of the NEAT model. It is shown that the results obtained with the model can be used as an important addition to and crosscheck for the <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> emission accounting in official greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventories prepared according to the guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

40|$|We {{present and}} apply a simple bottom–up model for {{estimating}} <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> {{of fossil fuels}} and resulting CO 2 (carbon dioxide) emissions. We apply this model for the year 2000 : (1) {{to the world as}} a whole, (2) to the aggregate of Annex I countries and non-Annex I countries, and (3) to the ten non-Annex I countries with the highest consumption of fossil fuels for non-energy purposes. We find that worldwide <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> is equivalent to 1, 670 ± 120 Mt (megatonnes) CO 2 and leads to 700 ± 90 Mt CO 2 emissions. Around 75 % of <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> emissions is related to industrial processes. The remainder is attributed to the emission source categories of solvent and other product use, agriculture, and waste.

40|$|Estimating CO 2 {{emissions}} {{resulting from}} the <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> of fossil fuels is not straightforward, because part of the carbon is released quickly as CO 2 whereas another part is first embodied in organic chemicals. To contribute to a more accurate non-energy useCO 2 emission accounting, the <b>Non-energy</b> <b>use</b> Emission Accounting Tables (NEAT) model has been developed, which is in this paper applied to the Netherlands for the time period 1993 – 1999. For this period, we estimate the total <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> in CO 2 equivalents in the Netherlands to vary between 26. 1 and 30. 2 Mt CO 2. Of this total, 4. 6 – 6. 6 Mt CO 2 is emitted in industrial processes and during product use. The remainder is stored, resulting in an overall storage fraction of approximately 80 %. Given the uncertainties involved, we cannot distinguish clear trends for the years of study. We show that the definition of <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> has {{a significant effect on}} the calculated storage fractions. The carbon storage according to the Dutch national greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventory is 5 – 9 MtCO 2 lower compared to theNEAT result. As a result, total fossil CO 2 emissions (including those from fossil fuel combustion) according to the national inventory are higher by the same amount, which is 3 – 5 % of the total Dutch emissions. The difference is among other things caused by difficulties associated with the direct use of <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> figures from the Dutch energy statistics for CO 2 emission accounting.

40|$|The <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> {{of fossil}} fuels {{is a source of}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{emissions}} that is not negligible and has been increasing substantially in the last three decades. Current emission estimates for this source category are subject to major uncertainties. One important reason is that <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> as published in energy statistics is not defined in a consistent manner, rendering calculation results based on these data incomparable across countries (concerns in particular the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Reference Approach). Further reasons are the complexity and interlinkage of the energy and material flows in the chemical/petrochemical sector and the current use of storage fractions as default values in the IPCC Reference Approach, which are based on a different definition of storage and refer to other flows than those available from energy statistics. Several other shortcomings of the IPCC Reference Approach are identified in this paper, e. g. the fact that it neglects international trade of synthetic organic products. In order to improve emissions accounting, the <b>Non-Energy</b> <b>Use</b> and CO 2 Emissions (NEU-CO 2) network developed a model called <b>Non-Energy</b> <b>Use</b> Emission Accounting Tables (NEAT), which is based on Material Flow Analysis (MFA). The NEAT model and other MFA approaches have been applied to several countries. In this paper, the results for Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands and the USA are compared with the values published in National Communications to the United Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It is shown that the international harmonisation of the data sources (energy statistics) and the methods appliedwould lead to substantially different emissions results for some countries, in the order of several percent. Moreover, the NEAT model and the other MFA have proved to be a valuable tool to identify errors in energy statistics. These results confirm the need for enhanced efforts to improve and harmonise energy statistics and estimation methods for CO 2 emissions from <b>non-energy</b> <b>use.</b> The articles in this special issue contribute to reaching these goals...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of energy use and {{greenhouse}} gas emissions, the manufacturing industry plays a dual role, namely (i) as consumer of energy and (ii) as producer of energy-consuming technologies. Although the manufacturing industry has been subject to extensive research, knowledge gaps still exist regarding (i) a detailed and accurate accounting {{of the use of}} fossil fuels for non-energy purposes (e. g., as feedstock in the chemical industry) and the resulting emissions as well as (ii) with respect to the rate at which cost decline occurs for novel and efficient energy demand technologies. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we develop bottom-up models that quantify <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> of fossil fuels and related emissions at various levels of detail. We quantify in Chapter 2 worldwide <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> in the year 2000 to be 20 2 EJ, thereby accounting for 5 % of the global total primary energy supply. In Chapter 3, we estimate that in the year 2000, <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> leads on a global scale to emissions of 700 90 Mt CO 2. The forty industrialized Annex I countries account for 51 % (360 50 Mt CO 2) of this total, where as the remaining non-Annex I countries account for 49 % (340 70 Mt CO 2). Chapter 4 shows that yearly <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> emissions in Germany increased on average by 1. 8 % per year between 1990 and 2003. Our <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> emission estimates help closing major gaps in the German GHG inventory. We conclude that our bottom-up models allow a more detailed, complete, and accurate accounting of <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> emissions in comparison to existing methodologies. To address the second research question, we apply the experience curve approach to model prices (as proxy for actual production costs) of energy demand technologies as power-law function of cumulative production. We quantify the change in productions costs by so-called learning rates (LR), which represent the percentage of cost decline with each doubling of cumulative production. In Chapter 5, we estimate that prices of condensing gas combi boilers decline at a learning rate of 14 1 %. For large appliances, we find in Chapter 6 a robust long-term price decline for wet and cold appliances at learning rates of, on average, 29 8 % and 9 4 %, respectively. These results are in line with the findings of our literature review (Chapter 7), where we identify that learning rates of energy demand technologies are approximately normally distributed around a mean of 18 9 %. By modelling the specific energy consumption of large appliances as function of cumulative production, we extend the conventional experience curve approach and quantify technological learning from a broader perspective. The resulting energy experience curves indicate a robust decline in the specific energy consumption of wet appliances (LR of 18 3 % to 35 3 %) and cold appliances (LR of 13 3 % to 17 2 %). We conclude that our results indicate that technological learning helps to achieve a more efficient use of energy at declining costs...|$|E

We show the crucial role played by different dynamic formulations of the translog in this analysis of factor demands with respect to rates of dynamic adjustment and substitution possibilities. We conclude that the poor performance of the dynamic translog relative to the dynamic logit cannot be explained solely by dynamic model mis-specification or the inclusion of price-unresponsive <b>non-energy</b> fuel <b>use</b> data.

Globally, and in most countries, CO{sub 2 } accounts for more than 90 % of CO{sub 2 }-eq GHG emissions from the industrial sector (Price et al., 2006; US EPA, 2006 b). These CO{sub 2 } emissions arise from three sources: (1) the use of fossil fuels for energy, either directly by industry for heat and power generation or indirectly in the generation of purchased electricity and steam; (2) <b>non-energy</b> <b>uses</b> of fossil fuels in chemical processing and metal smelting; and (3) non-fossil fuel sources, for example cement and lime manufacture. Industrial processes also emit other GHGs, e. g. : (1) Nitrous oxide (N{sub 2 }O) is emitted as a byproduct of adipic acid, nitric acid and caprolactam production; (2) HFC- 23 is emitted as a byproduct of HCFC- 22 production, a refrigerant, and also used in fluoroplastics manufacture; (3) Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are emitted as byproducts of aluminium smelting and in semiconductor manufacture; (4) Sulphur hexafluoride (SF{sub 6 }) is emitted in the manufacture, use and, decommissioning of gas insulated electrical switchgear, during the production of flat screen panels and semiconductors, from magnesium die casting and other industrial applications; (5) Methane (CH{sub 4 }) is emitted as a byproduct of some chemical processes; and (6) CH{sub 4 } and N{sub 2 }O can be emitted by food industry waste streams. Many GHG emission mitigation options have been developed for the industrial sector. They fall into three categories: operating procedures, sector-wide technologies and process-specific technologies. A sampling of these options is discussed in Sections 7. 2 - 7. 4. The short- and medium-term potential for and cost of all classes of options are discussed in Section 7. 5, barriers to the application of these options are addressed in Section 7. 6 and the implication of industrial mitigation for sustainable development is discussed in Section 7. 7. Section 7. 8 discusses the sector's vulnerability to climate change and options for adaptation. A number of policies have been designed either to encourage voluntary GHG emission reductions from the industrial sector or to mandate such reductions. Section 7. 9 describes these policies and the experience gained to date. Co-benefits of reducing GHG emissions from the industrial sector are discussed in Section 7. 10.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{examine the}} impact of energy price shocks in the United Kingdom using a New-Keynsian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model and a classic Real Business Cycle (RBC) model. The models are {{augmented}} with real rigidities and driven by exogenous shocks. Chapter 1 examines a DSGE model with New-Keynesian Philips Curve with three outputs of energy (petrol and utility), and <b>non-energy</b> output, <b>using</b> filtered data (1981 :Q 1 - 2014 :Q 4) of the UK. Chapter 2 examines a two-sector (RBC) model of energy intensive output and <b>non-energy</b> intensive output, <b>using</b> unfiltered data (1990 :Q 1 - 2014 :Q 4) of the UK. The models are econometrically estimated using indirect inference test that includes Monte Carlo simulation. I show how the study can be quantitatively applied by evaluating the effects of different shocks on output, relative prices and interest rate. I also show how energy price shocks affect output, asset prices and aggregate consumption in a classic RBC model. By decomposition, the changes in these variables caused by each of the structural shocks showed that a fall in output during the financial crisis period 2008 :Q 2 to 2009 :Q 4 was driven by energy price shocks and sector-specific productivity shocks. Conversely, in the DSGE model with NKPC, the changes in these variables caused by each of the structural shocks showed that a fall in output during the financial crisis period 2008 :Q 2 to 2009 :Q 4 was driven by domestic demand shocks (consumption preference, government spending and capital adjustment cost), oil prices shock and world demand shock. I found why the energy price shock reduces GDP in the models: In NKPC model with stationary shocks this is only a temporary terms of trade shock and so GDP only falls briefly, such that, the UK can borrow against such a temporary fall. In the RBC two-sector model, I found, it must be that the terms of trade rise permanently when world energy price increase as it is non-stationary and {{there is no other way}} to balance the current account than to reduce absorption due to lack of substitute for energy inputs. Finally, I found that the RBC two-sector model with non-stationary shocks performs better than NKPC model with stationary shocks. The performance can be credited to using unfiltered-data on the RBC model.

This new technology, a variable floatation decoater (VFD), is being developed by the U. S. Department of Energy and a private engineering firm to replace the standard rotary kilns currently used for scrap decoating. Rotary kilns have traditionally been employed in the decoating process. However, a VFD removes organics of any type from scrap aluminum and steel using less energy. High velocity gases mechanically strip off liquid organics in a low oxygen environment. The organic laden gases are then sent to an afterburner to vaporize the organics. The VFD meets the EPA’s new Clean Air Act standards for dryers, decoaters and delacquering kilns. Based on lab testing and empirical data, VFDs can reduce the energy used by the decoating process by 50 % while reducing the decoating cycle by 80 %.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the literature on energy demand in three ways. Firstly, it examines the major determinants of energy demand using a panel of 23 developed countries and 16 developing countries during 1978 to 2003. Secondly, it examines the demand for energy in the industrial sector and the extent of inter-fuel substitution, as well as substitution between energy and <b>non-energy</b> inputs, <b>using</b> data from 5 advanced countries and 5 energy producer's developing countries. Third, the thesis investigates empirically the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth for these groups of countries over a 26 -year period. The empirical results of this study confirm the majority of the findings in energy demand analysis. Income and price have shown to be important determinants for energy consumption in both developed and developing countries. Moreover, both economic structure and technical progress appear to exert significant impacts on energy consumption. Income has a positive impact on energy demand and the effect is larger in developing countries. In both developed and developing countries, price has a negative impact but these effects are larger in developed countries than in developing countries. The share of industry in GDP is positive and has a greater impact on energy demand in developing countries, whereas technological progress is found to be energy using in developed countries and energy saving in developing countries. With respect to the analysis of inter-factor and inter-fuel substitution in industrial energy demand, the results provide evidence for substitution possibilities between factor inputs and fuels. Substitutability is observed between capital and energy, capital and labour and labour and energy. These findings confirm previous evidence that production technologies in these countries allow flexibility in the capital-energy, capital-labour and labour-energy mix. In the energy sub-model, the elasticities of substitution show that large substitution took place from petroleum to coal, natural gas and especially to electricity. In addition, the evidence for significant inter-fuel substitution between coal and natural gas implies that there is a possibility of replacing the use of coal with natural gas in the industrial sector. The existence of moderate input substitution suggests that there is some flexibility in energy policy options and energy utilization. Finally, the empirical evidence presented in this study suggests that the direction of causality between energy consumption and economic growth varies substantially across countries. There is a unidirectional causality running from GDP to energy consumption in 12 developed countries and in 5 developing countries. A unidirectional causality from energy to GDP exists in Netherlands and bidirectional causality exists in Slovak Republic...|$|R

The energy consumption and demand sectors are divided into the categories: residential and commercial, transportation, and industrial and electrical generation (utilities). All sectors except electrical generation use varying amounts of fossile fuel resources for non-energy purposes. The highest percentage of <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> by sector is industrial with 71. 3 percent. The household and commercial sector uses 28. 4 percent, and transportation about 0. 3 percent.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the use of fossil carbon (oil, natural gas, coal) to {{manufacture}} materials (‘products of non-energy use') and with the potential to reduce the inputs of fossil resources and the emissions of fossil CO 2 in Germany. An overview of the material flows is given for Germany in 1995. Recycled and re-used products still accounted for less than 10 % of the end products consumed domestically. The energy requirements and CO 2 emissions from the production and waste management processes related to <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> have been calculated: it is estimated that approximately 1700 PJ of finite primary energy are consumed and 57 Mt of fossil CO 2 emissions are released (1995). Compared with the total German industry (without <b>non-energy</b> <b>use)</b> this represents 44 % of the energy use and 20 % of the fossil CO 2 emissions. Detailed analyses are performed {{in order to determine the}} extent to which the energy consumed by and the CO 2 emissions released from this system could be reduced. This is done by estimating the possible effects of (a) using waste as a resource, and (b) using biomass as a feedstock. In the first group recycling, re-use and enhanced energy recovery are investigated for plastics, discarded tyres, technical rubber products, asphalt, industrial bitumen and waste lubricants. The second group, i. e. the analysed bio-based materials, comprises of oleochemical surfactants, lubricants from vegetable oils, starch polymers and selected bulk chemicals. The total potential savings related to waste use and biomass use (see above (a) and (b)) are estimated at 220 PJ of gross finite energy and 14 Mt of gross fossil CO 2. This is the equivalent of a 13 % saving in energy and a 24 % reduction in CO 2 emissions. Hence, the saving potential identified on the non-energy side is comparable with the saving potential discussed and negotiated for CO 2 mitigation through energy efficiency improvements...|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> of fossil fuels, energy and {{material}} flows are very complex. We developed a process chain model to understand the interlinkages and the resulting CO 2 emissions of such a system. This work aims to assess the implications of structural changes in production together with recycling strategies and production rates. The model is based on data for West Germany in 1989. Starting form an Excel spreadsheet model for mass flows we began to transfer our model to a conventional process simulator {{in order to test}} the optimizing capabilities and the balance options for material and energy flows. Due to the complexity of the task, we tested the usefulness of the simulator for the envisioned purposes using a small example for the production of PVC. The first results of a sensitivity study and an optimation run for recycling strategies are presented. Finally, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using a process simulator for the modelling of process chains is discussed...|$|E
40|$|For any nation, {{sector-wise}} {{forecasts of}} energy demand and emissions are becoming valuable elements in devising its {{national and international}} policies relating to energy security, local environment, and global climate change. It is {{in this context that}} this work attempts to forecast India's possible energy demands and emissions adopting a key indicator approach on least cost generation expansion optimization methodology for a long time frame. This study developed key indicators for useful-energy demand for end-use sectors such as industry, commerce, and residence. Key indicators for transport sector and <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> sectors were developed on transport mobility demand and end-use fuel demand. The main drivers of these key indicators are socio-economic parameters. This work was conducted in a linear programmed (LP) TIMES G 5 model on TIMES modeling framework for model horizon of 1990 - 2100. By the end of the 21 st-century, India's energy demands are projected to be about 1825 Â Mtoe of primary energy, 1263 Â Mtoe of final energy consumption, 4840 Â TWh of electricity generations, 723 Â Mtoe of energy import, and 4414 Â Mt of CO 2 emissions.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the study of <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> of lignite. The main {{objective}} was to find an optimal recipe for the preparation of liquid and semi-solid (paste) hydrocolloids from the South Moravian lignite using the planetary mill and select the suitable dispersion medium with emphasis on possible use in agriculture. The used solutions were 10, 20 a 40 % w/w solutions of urea; 5, 10 a 15 % w/w solutions of citric acid; 1, 5 a 10 % w/w solutions of potassium chloride and deionized water. The best weight ratio for the preparation of lignite hydrocolloids is 1 part of lignite and 2 parts of the solution. The next part of this work is the isolation of humic acid from lignite hydrocolloids. The weight of isolated humic acids and amount of ash were compared to the used lignite hydrocolloids. Rheological behavior, particle size distribution, stability and thermal stablity of prepared lignite hydrocolloids were investigated. Correlation microscopy was used for determining elemental composition of selected location in the sample of lignite hydrocolloid...|$|E
40|$|This report concludes {{the first}} phase of the NEU-CO 2 network, {{covering}} the period from January 1999 to June 2000. Within this period, two workshops were held, one in Paris in September 1999 and the other in Brussels in April 2000. The results of these workshops represent the basis of this report. The workshop papers have also been compiled in workshop proceedings which are publicly available. Due to the success of the NEU-CO 2 network, the partners decided to apply for the continuation of this activity which was recently accepted by the European Commission. The second phase of the NEU-CO 2 network will start in Fall 2000 and will continue for 18 months. This will allow the NEU-CO 2 network to improve the methods applied, to close data gaps, to check the preliminary conclusions given in this report and to provide consolidated results and recommendations by mid 2002. The ultimate goal of the NEU-CO 2 network is to contribute to an improvement of the IPCC guidelines in the area of <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> and to provide inventorists with tools and methods to estimate more accurately non-energy CO 2 emissions...|$|E
40|$|Calculations of sectoral CO_ 2 {{emissions}} from fossil fuel {{burning in the}} period 1971 - 1990 were done for the 15 countries {{at the top of}} the list of nations ordered by decreasing contribution to global emissions, namely: United States of America, Soviet Union, People's Republic of China, Japan, Federal Republic of Germany, United Kingdom, India, Poland, Canada, France, Italy, German Democratic Republic, South Africa, Mexico and Czechoslovakia. In addition, the CO_ 2 emission of two groups of industrialized countries, namely the OECD and the European Economic Community (EEC) were calculated. The main recommendations of the IPCC/OECD current methodology have been adopted for the calculations, with the principal exception that CO_ 2 {{emissions from}} the use of bunker fuels have not been included in the national estimates.

40|$|Analyzing the {{chemical}} industry’s energy use is challenging {{because of the}} sector’s complexity and the prevailing uncertainty in energy use and production data. We develop an advanced bottom-up model (PIE-Plus) which encompasses the energy use of the 139 most important chemical processes. We apply this model in a case study to analyze the German basic chemical industry’s energy use and energy efficiency improvements in the period between 1995 and 2008. We compare our results with data from the German Energy Balances and with data published by the International Energy Agency (IEA). We find that our model covers 88 % of the basic chemical industry’s total final energy use (including <b>non-energy</b> <b>use)</b> {{as reported in the}} German Energy Balances. The observed energy efficiency improvements range between 2. 2 and 3. 5 % per year, i. e., they are on the higher side of the values typically reported in literature. Our results point to uncertainties in the basic chemical industry’s final energy use as reported in the energy statistics and the specific energy consumption values. More efforts are required {{to improve the quality of}} the national and international energy statistics to make them useable for reliable monitoring of energy efficiency improvements of {{the chemical}} industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{photos on}} the front and back cover of this report depict the eight largest key {{categories}} from the 1990 – 2005 Inventory. The IPCC’s Good Practice Guidance (IPCC 2000) defines a key category as a “[source or sink category] that is prioritized within the national inventory system because its estimate has a significant influence on a country’s total inventory of direct greenhouse gases in terms of the absolute level of emissions, the trend in emissions, or both. ” By definition, key categories are sources or sinks that have the greatest contribution to the absolute overall level of national emissions in any of the years covered by the time series. Key category names can differ from those used elsewhere in the inventory report, due to naming conventions necessary to comply with UNFCCC reporting guidelines. Carbon Dioxide Emissions from <b>Non-Energy</b> <b>Use</b> of Fuels Rather than being combusted for energy, fuels consumed for non-energy purposes act as building blocks or reagents in fabricating other materials. These fossil-fuel-derived materials are important from an emissions perspective since they often provide long-term storage of the fuel’s carbon. Emissions from this source have increased 21 percent since 1990. Direct Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Agricultural Soil Managemen...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} fossil fuels for {{non-energy}} purposes such as production of bulk chemicals is poorly understood. In {{this study we}} analyse data on non-energy demand and disaggregate it across key services or products. We construct a simulation model for the main products of <b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> and project the global demand for primary fuels used as feedstocks and the resulting carbon emissions until 2100. The model is then applied to estimate the potential emission reductions by increased use of biomass, a more ambitious climate policy and advanced post-consumer waste management. We project that the global gross demand for feedstocks more than triples from 30 EJ in 2010 to over 100 EJ in 2100, mainly due to the increased demand for high value chemicals such as ethylene. Carbon emissions increase disproportionately (from 160 MtC per year in 2010 to over 650 MtC per year in 2100) due to greater use of coal, especially in ammonia and methanol production. If biomass is used, it can supply {{a large portion of}} the required primary energy and reduce carbon emissions by up to 20 % in 2100 compared to the reference development. Climate policy can further reduce emissions by over 30 %. Post-consumer waste management options such as recycling or incineration with energy recovery do not necessarily reduce energy demand or carbon emissions...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{petrochemical}} supply chain shares in {{global warming is}} studied by monitoring carbon footprint during manufacturing and distribution phase. For identification and measurement of carbon emissions in petrochemical supply chain, at first step necessary data are collected. Then carbon footprint is calculated in manufacturing process. So GHG is measured during fossil fuel use for chemical productions and electricity production in exclusive power plant in production phase. Also carbon emissions are calculated during chemical process (<b>non-energy</b> <b>use</b> of fossil fuels). The other activity that {{has an impact on}} GHG emissions is transportation. In this study Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) methodology was employed. For conducting this research Shazand petrochemical complex in Iran is selected as a case study. The calculations and monitoring GHG will help to greening the petrochemical supply chain. The result shows GHG emissions in Shazad petrochemical complex supply chain is 6108960. 35 tons per year. 6100434. 9 tones CO 2 equ per year emit from manufacturing phase and 8525. 4 tones CO 2 equ per year emit from distribution phase.
