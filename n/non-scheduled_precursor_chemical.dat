Many nations still lack the capacity to determine whether the import or export of <b>precursor</b> <b>chemicals</b> is related to legitimate needs or illicit drugs. The problem is {{complicated by the fact that}} many chemical shipments are either brokered or transshipped through third countries in an attempt to disguise their purpose or destination.|$|R

There is little to suggest routine, or even infrequent, use of <b>precursor</b> <b>chemicals</b> in the Oceania region. The region nevertheless is vulnerable.

2500|$|China is a {{major source}} of <b>precursor</b> <b>chemicals</b> {{necessary}} for the production of cocaine, heroin, MDMA and crystal methamphetamine, which are used by many Southeast Asian and Pacific Rim nations. China produces over 100,000 metric tons of acetic anhydride each year, and imports an additional 20,000 metric tons from the United States and Singapore. Reports indicate that acetic anhydride is diverted from China to morphine and heroin refineries in the Golden Triangle. [...] China is also a leading exporter of bulk ephedrine and has been a source country for much of the ephedrine and pseudoephedrine imported into Mexico; these <b>precursor</b> <b>chemicals</b> are subsequently used to manufacture methamphetamine destined for the United States. China is developing a significant MDMA production, trafficking, and consumption problem. Although China has taken actions through legislation and regulation of production and exportation of <b>precursor</b> <b>chemicals,</b> extensive action is required to control the illicit diversion and smuggling of <b>precursor</b> <b>chemicals.</b>|$|R

40|$|Semi-analytical {{solutions}} for a cubic autocatalytic reaction, with linear decay and a <b>precursor</b> <b>chemical,</b> are considered. The model is coupled with diffusion and considered in a one-dimensional reactor. In this model the reactant is supplied by two mechanisms, diffusion via the cell boundaries and decay of an abundant <b>precursor</b> <b>chemical</b> {{present in the}} reactor. The Galerkin method is used to approximate the spatial structure of the reactant and autocatalyst concentrations in the reactor. Ordinary differential equations are then obtained as an approximation to the governing partial differential equations and analyzed to obtain semi-analytical results for the reaction-diffusion cell. Singularity theory and a local stability analysis are {{used to determine the}} regions of parameter space in which the different types of bifurcation diagrams and Hopf bifurcations occur.
