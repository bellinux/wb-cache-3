The high-dimensional and heterogeneous time series dataset is analyzed to discover properties of <b>near</b> <b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions</b> (NMACs) and categorize the NMAC encounters. Domain experts use these properties to better organize and understand NMAC occurrences. Existing solutions either are not capable of handling high-dimensional and heterogeneous time series datasets or do not provide explanations that are interpretable by a domain expert. The latter is critical to the acceptance and deployment of safety-critical systems. To address this gap, we propose grammar-based decision trees along with a learning algorithm. Our approach extends decision trees with a grammar framework for classifying heterogeneous time series data. A context-free grammar is used to derive decision expressions that are interpretable, application-specific, and support heterogeneous data types. In addition to classification, we show how grammar-based decision trees can also be used for categorization, which is a combination of clustering and generating interpretable explanations for each cluster. We apply grammar-based decision trees to a simulated aircraft encounter dataset and evaluate the performance of four variants of our learning algorithm.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} several {{models to}} compare cen-tralized and distributed automated separation assurance concepts in aviation. In a centralized system, safety-related functions are implemented by common equipment on the ground. In a distributed system, safety-related functions are implemented by equipment on each aircraft. Failures of the safety-related func-tions {{can increase the}} risk of <b>near</b> <b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions.</b> Intuitively, failures on the ground are worse than failures in the air because the ground failures simultaneously affect multiple aircraft. This paper evaluates the degree to which this is true. Using region-wide models to account for dependencies between aircraft pairs, we derive the region-wide expectation and variance of the number of separation losses for both centralized and distributed concepts. This is done first for a basic scenario involving a single component/function. We show that the variance of the number of separation losses is always higher for the centralized system, holding the expectations equal. However, numerical examples show that the difference is negligible when the events of interest are rare. Results are extended to a hybrid centralized-distributed scenario involving multiple components/functions on the ground and in the air. In this case, the variance of the centralized system may actually be less than that of the distributed system. The overall implication is that the common-cause failure of the ground function does not seriously weaken the overall case for using a centralized concept versus a distributed concept.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} a {{study that}} drove {{the development of a}} mathematical expression in the minimum operational performance standards (MOPS) of detect-and-avoid (DAA) systems for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). This equation describes the conditions under which vertical maneuver guidance could be provided during recovery of well clear separation with a non-cooperative VFR aircraft in addition to horizontal maneuver guidance. Although suppressing vertical maneuver guidance in these situations increased the minimum horizontal separation from 500 to 800 feet, the maximum severity of loss of well clear increased in about 35 of the encounters compared to when a vertical maneuver was preferred and allowed. Additionally, analysis of individual cases led to the identification of a class of encounter where vertical rate error had a large effect on horizontal maneuvers due to the difficulty of making the correct left-right turn decision: crossing conflict with intruder changing altitude. These results supported allowing vertical maneuvers when UAS vertical performance exceeds the relative vertical position and velocity accuracy of the DAA tracker given the current velocity of the UAS and the relative vertical position and velocity estimated by the DAA tracker. Looking ahead, these results indicate a need to improve guidance algorithms by utilizing maneuver stability and <b>near</b> <b>mid-air</b> <b>collision</b> risk when determining maneuver guidance to regain well clear separation...|$|E

40|$|Taking {{the move}} from our recent {{research}} on GNSS Avionics Based Integrity Augmentation (ABIA), this article investigates the synergies of ABIA with a novel Detect-and-Avoid (DAA) architecture for Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS). Based on simulation and experimental data collected {{on a variety of}} manned and unmanned aircraft, it was observed that the integration of ABIA with DAA has the potential to provide an integrity-augmented DAA for both cooperative and non-cooperative applications. The candidate DAA system uses various Forward-Looking Sensors (FLS) for the non-cooperative case and Automatic Dependent Surveillance- Broadcast (ADS-B) in addition to TCAS/ASAS for the cooperative case. Both in the cooperative and non-cooperative cases, the risk of collision is evaluated by setting a threshold on the Probability Density Function (PDF) of a <b>Near</b> <b>Mid-Air</b> <b>Collision</b> (NMAC) event over the separation area. So, if the specified threshold is exceeded, an avoidance manoeuvre is performed based on a heading-based Differential Geometry (DG) algorithm and optimized utilizing a cost function with minimum time constraints and fuel penalty criteria weighted as a function of separation distance. Additionally, the optimised avoidance trajectory considers the constraints imposed by the ABIA in terms of RPAS platform dynamics and GNSS constellation satellite elevation angles, preventing degradation or losses of navigation data during the whole DAA loop. This integration scheme allows real-time trajectory corrections to re-establish the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) when actual GNSS accuracy degradations and/or data losses take place (e. g., due to aircraft-satellite relative geometry, GNSS receiver tracking, interference, jamming or other external factors).

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the Monte Carlo Real-Time Belief Space Search (MC-RTBSS) algorithm, a novel, online planning algorithm for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). MC-RTBSS combines a sample-based belief state representation with a {{branch and bound}} pruning method to search through the belief space for the optimal policy. The algorithm {{is applied to the}} problem of aircraft collision avoidance and its performance is compared to the Trac Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) in simulated encounter scenarios. The simulations are generated using an encounter model formulated as a dynamic Bayesian network that is based on radar feeds covering U. S. airspace. MC-RTBSS leverages statistical information from the airspace model to predict future intruder behavior and inform its maneuvers. Use of the POMDP formulation permits the inclusion of different sensor suites and aircraft dynamic models. The behavior of MC-RTBSS is demonstrated using encounters generated from an airspace model and comparing the results to TCAS simulation results. In the simulations, both MC-RTBSS and TCAS measure intruder range, bearing, and relative altitude with the same noise parameters. Increasing the penalty of a <b>Near</b> <b>Mid-Air</b> <b>Collision</b> (NMAC) in the MC-RTBSS reward function reduces the number of NMACs, although the algorithm is limited by the number of particles used for belief state projections. Increasing the number of particles and observations used during belief state projection increases performance. (cont.) Increasing these parameter values also increases computation time, which needs to be mitigated using a more efficient implementation of MC-RTBSS to permit real-time use. by Travis Benjamin Wolf.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} synergies between a GNSS Avionics Based Integrity Augmentation (ABIA) {{system and a}} novel Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) {{architecture}} for cooperative and non-cooperative scenarios. The integration of ABIA with SAA {{has the potential to}} provide an integrity-augmented SAA solution that will allow the safe and unrestricted access of UAS to commercial airspace. The candidate SAA system uses Forward-Looking Sensors (FLS) for the non-cooperative case and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) for the cooperative case. In the non-cooperative scenario, the system employs navigation-based image stabilization with image morphology operations and a multi-branch Viterbi filter for obstacle detection, which allows heading estimation. The system utilizes a Track-to-Track (T 3) algorithm for data fusion that allows combining data from different tracks obtained with FLS and/or ADS-B depending on the scenario. Successively, it utilizes an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm to estimate the state vector allowing a prediction of the intruder trajectory over a specified time horizon. Both in the cooperative and non-cooperative cases, the risk of collision is evaluated by setting a threshold on the Probability Density Function (PDF) of a <b>Near</b> <b>Mid-Air</b> <b>Collision</b> (NMAC) event over the separation area. So, if the specified threshold is exceeded, an avoidance manoeuver is performed based on a heading-based Differential Geometry (DG) algorithm and optimized utilizing a cost function with minimum time constraints and fuel penalty criteria weighted as a function of separation distance. Additionally, the optimised avoidance trajectory considers the constraints imposed by the ABIA in terms of GNSS constellation satellite elevation angles, preventing degradation or losses of navigation data during the whole SAA loop. This integration scheme allows real-time trajectory corrections to re-establish the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) when actual GNSS accuracy degradations and/or data losses take place (e. g., due to aircraft-satellite relative geometry, GNSS receiver tracking, interference, jamming or other external factors). Various simulation case studies were accomplished to evaluate the performance of this Integrity-Augmented SAA (IAS) architecture. The selected host platform was the AEROSONDE Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and the simulation cases addressed a variety of cooperative and non-cooperative scenarios in a representative cross-section of the AEROSONDE operational flight envelope.

40|$|Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) will be {{the basis}} of the future {{surveillance}} system in the US. To achieve benefit from ADS-B, aircraft have to be equipped with ADS-B avionics across all stakeholders. General Aviation (GA) comprises over 96 % of the active aircraft fleet in the US but average yearly utilization for GA aircraft is 21 times lower than that of commercial aircraft. Since many benefits from ADS-B depend on aircraft utilization, concern exists that ADS-B does not provide enough user benefit to GA, possibly resulting in delayed acceptance and aircraft equipage with ADS-B avionics. One way of providing user benefits and thus increasing incentives for GA users to equip with ADS-B is to create and implement ADS-B applications that are of high value to those operators. ADS-B Surveillance in non-RADAR airspace and ADS-B based Traffic Situation Awareness (TSA) are identified as two applications that are expected to provide significant benefit to GA. Both applications are evaluated and possible barriers to the delivery of benefit are identified. In order to identify where TSA would be most beneficial, ten years' worth of NTSB mid-air collision reports were reviewed. Ten years of ASRS and NMACS <b>near</b> <b>mid-air</b> <b>collision</b> (MAC) reports were also reviewed. The analysis revealed that aircraft are most likely to encounter each other in the airport vicinity - specifically in the pattern (59 % of MACs). Current Traffic Awareness systems are not reliable in that environment due to insufficient surveillance data quality. Surveillance data from ADS-B, however, has much higher resolution. Therefore, ADS-B based traffic alerting systems are expected to be capable of providing reliable alerting in such environments and would thus pose a significant incentive for GA to equip with ADS-B. An analysis of the current availability of low altitude surveillance over the continental United States was conducted in order to identify where ADS-B Low Altitude Surveillance would be beneficial. Providing low altitude surveillance has the potential to improve efficiency during IFR conditions. 27 towered airports with RADAR floors of more than 500 ft have been identified. ADS-B surveillance in those locations would create a significant benefit locally. Non-towered airports without low altitude surveillance are more common (806 total). ADS-B surveillance to such airports has the potential to increase airport acceptance rates in Instrument Flight weather and thus providing benefit to GA. However, in addition to providing surveillance, additional ATC procedures need to be developed to take advantage of such ADS-B surveillance. The new procedures would allow ATC to remain in radio communication with aircraft operating at non-towered airports, preventing the application of inefficient procedural control. by Fabrice Kunzi.

40|$|The U. S. Air Force's RQ- 4 Global Hawk {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle (UAV) is a high altitude, long endurance aircraft {{used for}} surveillance and reconnaissance. Because {{of the potential for}} close proximity to manned aircraft in civil airspace, collision avoidance is a major concern, and the Air Force is seeking to equip Global Hawk with the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) to reduce the probability of mid-air collision. Currently, Global Hawk is equipped with a Mode S transponder and uses chase aircraft, ground observers and/or ground radar contact to comply with the collision avoidance requirement. In order to evaluate TCAS effectiveness, a fast-time simulation tool has been developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory that computes the mean probability of a <b>near</b> <b>mid-air</b> <b>collision</b> for a large number of close encounters between two aircraft. Airspace encounter models enable sets of encounters to be simulated that are statistically representative of the aircraft encounters that actually occur in the airspace. The TCAS logic is implemented in the simulation tool and the aircraft responses during the encounters, with and without TCAS, are simulated in parallel. (cont.) By observing measured vertical miss distance at the closest point of approach between the two aircraft, it is possible to quantify the reduction in collision risk provided by TCAS, termed the risk ratio. Global Hawk's flight characteristics differ from a conventional aircraft. Its mission profile through civil airspace includes slow, steep climbs and descents, and shallower turns than a conventional aircraft. Its vertical acceleration and climb rate limits can hinder its response to a TCAS resolution advisory (RA). Communication latency also may occur. For this thesis, encounter models were developed that reflect Global Hawk's flight characteristics. The new encounter models were then implemented in the simulation tool, and millions of encounters between Global Hawk and a conventional aircraft were simulated. These encounters were compared against encounters between two conventional aircraft to observe how Global Hawk's flight characteristics changed the effectiveness of TCAS. Assuming a standard pilot response to TCAS RAs, TCAS provided a significant safety improvement to Global Hawk over a Mode S transponder alone, yielding risk ratios in the range of 0. 003 to 0. 079. (cont.) Global Hawk's flight characteristics generally caused a decrease in TCAS effectiveness from the original encounter models. Encounters were also simulated where Global Hawk's response to TCAS RAs was delayed by increasing amounts to simulate communication latency. A delay of approximately 15 seconds was tolerable before TCAS provided less safety than a Mode S transponder alone. by Thomas B. Billingsley. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The {{explanation}} of heterogeneous {{multivariate time series}} data is a central problem in many applications. The problem requires two major data mining challenges to be addressed simultaneously: Learning models that are human-interpretable and mining of heterogeneous multivariate time series data. The intersection of these two areas is not adequately explored in the existing literature. To address this gap, we propose grammar-based decision trees and an algorithm for learning them. Grammar-based decision tree extends decision trees with a grammar framework. Logical expressions, derived from context-free grammar, are used for branching in place of simple thresholds on attributes.

40|$|TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System) forms one of {{the crucial}} safety pillars in air traffic management. It has been {{designed}} to detect <b>near</b> <b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions,</b> provide advisories to the pilot and, ultimately, reduce the incidence of <b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions</b> between aircraft. Increasing traffic demands and the forthcoming use of drones in non-segregated air space poses novel evaluation challenges to TCAS. Important limitations of existing TCAS models are: that their model is specified through their computer code only, that uncertainties are not or only partially captured, and the difficulty in incorporating model changes in interactions with novel airspace users. These findings motivated the development of an agent-based modelling and simulation approach that takes various uncertainties well into account. The core development consists of a mathematical model of TCAS II specifications according to the internationally accepted operational performance standards of TCAS II and airborne collision avoidance system (ACAS). This model has been completed with other agents and their interactions, has been implemented in MATLAB, and has been validated against EUROCONTROL’s deterministic TCAS simulation model InCAS. The novel TCAS model considers the following uncertainties: errors in relative position measurements, errors in own rate of climb/descent estimates; variation in pilot response time; probability of reception of an interrogation response; variation in TCAS computation cycle. To assess the effect of these uncertainties on TCAS operations, several air traffic encounter scenarios are considered. For each scenario, rare event Monte Carlo simulations have been conducted. The results of the simulations show that the considered uncertainties may {{have a significant impact on}} the safety improvement by TCAS that often deviates from prior expectations. For example, the simulation results show that uncertainties may induce <b>mid-air</b> <b>collisions</b> in scenarios where continuation of the original aircraft flights would not have resulted in a <b>mid-air</b> <b>collision.</b> An overview of the results obtained will be given for current TCAS.
