40|$|Summary How do {{telecommunications}} policies influence technology adoption? Has {{regulatory reform}} helped mitigate or exacerbate the digital divide? We {{examine the effects}} of four policy reform strategies on a country's share of internet bandwidth, internet hosts, internet users, personal computers, and mobile phones. We argue that the best policy environment for the telecommunications sector is one maintained by an independent regulator that is not above representing the public interest or entering into public private partnerships to develop national information infrastructure. Holding other factors constant, privatizing the <b>national</b> telecommunications <b>operator</b> <b>only</b> has a few demonstrable effects, and the effects are mixed. Liberalizing the market for consumer communications services and separating the telecommunications regulator from direct control by the executive branch of government are, for the most part, constructive policies for encouraging technology adoption. Yet over time, too little public policy oversight usually has a negative impact on technology adoption. Regulatory independence mitigates against the digital divide, but regulatory withdrawal exacerbates it. Our findings offer greater coverage than prior research, and emerge from a time-series cross-sectional study of multiple technology indicators in 154 countries during the period 1990 - 2007. digital divide internet mobile phones policy reform time-series cross-sectional analysis developing countries...|$|R

In this paper, we will analyze the framework of regional railway passenger in France and Italy. We will then highlight the impact of the regionalization reform for both countries. We will show that regionalization is based on a double negotiation process : first, with the central State, it deals with the determining of financial grants due to this transfer of competence without transfer of charges. Secondly, it deals with a negotiation for establishing a convention Transport Authority / Regions and Operators. Organization and financing competence, communication, pricing, quality control will be competencies of the regions. We will then conclude by showing the challenge and limits of the reform. What are the brakes of the regionalization reform in France and Italy...|$|R
