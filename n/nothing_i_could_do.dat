500|$|Irvine {{scored the}} first {{points for the}} Jaguar team in the race, having failed to score up to that point. He {{described}} the race {{as one of the}} hardest in his Formula One career as his drink bottle did not function correctly along with suffering a blistered foot. He also said that the team's issues were not fully rectified and it would take [...] "six months or so to solve... hopefully we can do it quicker." [...] Salo said that his hands were bruised during the race as his car had no power steering equipped. Michael Schumacher admitted to feeling disappointed after the race, having led the majority of the race until his lap 56 retirement. He stated: [...] "The exhaust was too hot and that was why the rest went wrong. It basically cooked the suspension. I felt a few laps before that something was wrong but there was <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Stan Love, Wilson's {{cousin and}} band manager, fired Landy in December 1976 when Landy doubled his fee. Landy remembered 15 Big Ones as [...] "the only major success" [...] the Beach Boys had in recent years; [...] "Brian and I did that together. Right after that, I {{had to leave}} the situation. ... I was {{interested}} in making Brian a whole human being; they [...] were interested in getting another album done in time for 1977." [...] In 1977, Wilson was asked if Landy had too much control; he said, [...] "I thought so, but there was <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> about it and I eventually gave in to it.... control of my life legally through the commitment of my wife.... He definitely helped me. It cost over a hundred thousand dollars – he charged {{a hell of a lot}} per month." [...] Wilson then reported that Landy was replaced with a new doctor, Steve Schwartz. After several sessions with Wilson, Schwartz died in a camping accident, falling off a mountain to his death.|$|E
500|$|On September 14, 2008, Hochuli officiated a {{game between}} the San Diego Chargers and the Denver Broncos. He made an {{incorrect}} call with 1:17 left in the game, while Denver was in possession of the ball at the San Diego one-yard line and they were trailing the Chargers by seven points. On a second-down play, Denver quarterback Jay Cutler fumbled the ball, and it was recovered by San Diego linebacker Tim Dobbins. Ed Hochuli blew his whistle during the play, signaling that the play was dead and ruling an incomplete pass. Hochuli later wrote, [...] "Affecting {{the outcome of a}} game is a devastating feeling. Officials strive for perfection – I failed miserably." [...] The NFL passed a rule the following offseason allowing such plays to be reviewable under the instant replay rule for the 2009 NFL season. Speaking to Referee in November 2009, Hochuli told the magazine, [...] "It was really an easy play. I’ve thought many times why I did what I did. The best explanation is it was almost like dyslexia. I realized it was a fumble and did the wrong thing. I realized I was wrong but there was <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> about it." ...|$|E

Some of them looked as if they had tried to jump. I could see collapsed parachutes with the cords at full stretch. I could see there was <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> for anyone." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{talks with}} Thatcher, China planned to invade and seize Hong Kong if the {{negotiations}} set off unrest in the colony. Thatcher later said that Deng told her bluntly that China could easily take Hong Kong by force, stating that [...] "I could {{walk in and}} take the whole lot this afternoon", to which she replied that [...] "there is <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to stop you, but {{the eyes of the}} world would now know what China is like".|$|E
2500|$|IDF forces {{then began}} mopping up the final {{resistance}} in the Hawashin neighborhood. At 7:00 AM on April 11, the Palestinians began to surrender. Qabha refused to surrender and was killed, being among the last to die. Zakaria Zubeidi was among the only fighters who did not surrender. He {{slipped out of the}} area surrounded by the IDF, moved through the houses and left. Mardawi surrendered along with Ali Suleiman al-Saadi, known as [...] "Safouri", and thirty-nine others. He later said that [...] "There was <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> against that bulldozer".|$|E

2500|$|ESPN's Dan Rafael {{score the}} fight 114-111 {{in favour of}} Khan. HBO's {{unofficial}} scorer, Harold Lederman, scored it 113-112, also for Khan. After the fight Khan said, [...] "It was like I was against two people, the referee and Lamont himself. I was the cleaner fighter; he was so wild. The referee wasn't giving me a chance. I heard the referee give me a warning , but there was <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> He kept coming in with his head. There hasn't been [...] boxing in D.C. for the last [...] years {{because this is what}} happens."

2500|$|McCloy [...] "became very {{dizzy and}} lightheaded. Some drifted off into what {{appeared}} to be a deep sleep, and one person sitting near me collapsed and fell off his bucket, not moving. It was clear that there was <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to help him. The last person I remember speaking to was Jackie Weaver, who reassured me that if it were our time to go, then God’s will would be fulfilled. As my trapped co-workers lost consciousness one by one, the room grew still and I continued to sit and wait, unable to do much else. I have no idea how much time went by before I also passed out from the gas and smoke, awaiting rescue." ...|$|E
2500|$|Moskvin {{lived in}} Nizhny Novgorod, the fifth {{largest city in}} Russia. Moskvin said he began {{wandering}} through cemeteries with friends when still a schoolboy. In particular, they visited the Krasnaya Etna Cemetery located in the Leninsky district of Nizhny Novgorod. In an article written shortly before his arrest, Moskvin explained {{his interest in the}} dead, attributing it to a childhood incident during which he witnessed a funeral procession for an eleven-year-old girl. Moskvin alleged that the participants forced him to kiss the dead girl's face, writing that [...] "an adult pushed my face down to the waxy forehead of the girl in an embroidered cap, and there was <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> but kiss her as ordered." ...|$|E

2500|$|At Kentucky, Earnhardt Jr. {{struggled}} with overheated brakes, and even caused a caution when he brushed the outside wall in turns 3 and 4 {{halfway through the}} race. Later, on lap 206, {{he would be the}} subject of controversy when he rear-ended Danica Patrick and spun her out, in part because of his faulty brakes. Patrick retaliated by cursing at Earnhardt on the radio and ramming him on pit road. Earnhardt was perplexed with Patrick's reaction, saying [...] "I mean, what am I supposed to say other than the truth? We didn't have any brakes going into the corner. I know better than to run into her because it gets so much attention. There wasn't <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> I mean, as hard as I hit her, what the hell did she think I was doing? Trying to wreck her? We ain't got no problem. It's not like we were having a problem out on the racetrack with her. It's not like I just drew her name out of a hat and decided she was the one I was going to run into tonight." ...|$|E
2500|$|The tour's {{rendition}} of [...] "Rope Burn" [...] was considered [...] "incredibly sexy" [...] and [...] "what everyone was talking about", becoming its most controversial performance. During the act, Jackson [...] "plucks a male fan {{out of the}} crowd and ties his hands to the arms of a chair on stage while she gyrates around him and eventually kisses him." [...] The selected fan was required to be strapped into the chair due to safety concerns from Jackson's previous tour, after the participant had forcefully grabbed and fondled her while onstage. Jackson said, [...] "Everyone thinks it's this kinky thing. But the reason he gets strapped in is on this last tour, this guy grabbed my crotch. I sat on his lap and then I stood up and he grabbed my crotch, and I was trying to move his hand and he was too strong for me and he was just rubbing on my crotch. There was <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> so I said to myself I would never let that happen again." [...] Jackson's performance of [...] "What About" [...] is also infamous for its portrayal of domestic violence and abuse. The tour's [...] "racy" [...] costumes were designed by fashion designer David Cardona, who commented [...] "All her life it's been about Janet being cute. Now it's about Janet being sexy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lifeson {{was born}} as Alexandar Zivojinovich (Aleksandar Živojinović in Serbian) in Fernie, British Columbia, to Serbian immigrants, Nenad and Melanija Živojinović, {{and raised in}} Toronto, Ontario. His stage name of [...] "Lifeson" [...] is a semi-literal {{translation}} of the surname Živojinović, which means [...] "son of life" [...] in Serbian. His first exposure to formal music training {{came in the form}} of the viola, which he renounced for the guitar at the age of 12. His first guitar was a Christmas gift from his father, a six-string Kent classical acoustic which was later upgraded to an electric Japanese model. During his adolescent years, he was influenced primarily by Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Steve Hackett, and Allan Holdsworth; he explained in 2011 that [...] "Clapton's solos seemed a little easier and more approachable. I remember sitting at my record player and moving the needle back and forth to get the solo in 'Spoonful.' But there was <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> with Hendrix." [...] In 1963 Lifeson met future Rush drummer John Rutsey in school. Both interested in music, they decided to form a band. Lifeson was primarily a self-taught guitarist with the only formal instruction coming from a high school friend in 1971 who taught classical guitar lessons. This training lasted for roughly a year and a half.|$|E
60|$|What <b>could</b> <b>I</b> say? It was no {{more use}} trying to put them right {{than it had been}} when I mistook Toto for a rat. Peter had gone to sleep that night pretending about the brigands to pass the time, and when he awoke he still {{believed}} in them. He was that sort of child. There was <b>nothing</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> about it.|$|R

2500|$|At that time, the {{imperial}} administration was selecting many officials to fill its posts, {{and there were}} many officials who received positions after lying about their lineages or past experiences. [...] Emperor Taizong issued an edict ordering the officials to admit to their falsehoods, promising to spare them if they did so before a deadline, but stating that they would be executed if their falsehoods were discovered after the deadline. [...] When some officials were indeed discovered after the deadline to have falsified their lineages or past experiences, Emperor Taizong ordered that they be executed, but Dai rejected the order and instead sentenced them to exile. [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "I issued an edict that those who did not admit would be executed, but you, lord, sentenced them only to exile. [...] This made my words not stand up to the people. [...] Are you betraying justice, lord?" [...] Dai responded, [...] "If Your Imperial Majesty had killed them on the spot, there would be <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> [...] Now that you have sent them to the supreme court, I have to follow the law." [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "You, lord, are following the law, but you are making me lose credibility." [...] Dai responded, [...] "The law is how the empire can keep its credibility. [...] Your Imperial Majesty made your words based on your feelings at that time, and you declared executions based on your anger. [...] By repudiating your action and putting them {{in the hands of the}} law, you are showing that you can hold back your anger and respect the state's credibility. [...] I would feel pity if Your Imperial Majesty followed your anger and not your credibility." [...] Emperor Taizong was pleased and responded, [...] "I now know that if there is a problem with the law, you, Duke, will correct it. [...] I do not worry any more." [...] It was said that Dai often spoke against Emperor Taizong's wishes in this way, and that as a result, people were not falsely convicted or punished while he was serving.|$|E

60|$|The {{information}} {{was not as}} reassuring as my servant seemed to think, but I reflected {{that he was going}} straight back to the Eastern Star, and that there was a doctor aboard of her, so that there was <b>nothing</b> which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> in the matter. None the less, when I thought of his thirst, his burning hands, his heavy eye, his tripping speech, and lastly, of that leprous forehead, I carried with me to bed an unpleasant memory of my visitor and his visit.|$|R
60|$|But I {{confess that}} Cristel's allusion to a {{possible}} accident rather oppressed my mind, situated as we were at that time. What we talked of next has slipped from my memory.

2500|$|The minor success against Heth did {{not make}} up for the extreme {{frustration}} in the Lincoln administration about allowing Lee to escape.
