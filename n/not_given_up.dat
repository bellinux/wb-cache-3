According to Idolator's Robbie Daw, the opening lyrics to 'Not <b>Giving</b> <b>Up</b> On Love' could almost be describing Sophie’s feelings about her chart fortunes {{over the past}} year: [...] "I know you’re feeling restless, like life’s not on your side/It’s weighing heavy on your mind."In the chorus, she sings: [...] "Hold me now, nothing else matters, it’s {{just the two of}} us / And if it all falls down, nothing else matters, you know we’re strong enough / I’m <b>not</b> <b>giving</b> <b>up,</b> I’m <b>not</b> <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> on us / I said I’m <b>not</b> <b>giving</b> <b>up,</b> I’m <b>not</b> <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> on love." ...|$|R

5|$|There was {{no clear}} {{solution}} to combating Britain from the air. Göring had <b>not</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> hope {{of winning a}} victory by airborne assault. He discussed the possibility of invading Ireland (Fall Grün, or Operation Green) with Kurt Student in January 1941, in order to surround Britain by land, sea and air. The operation was shelved. Instead, the Luftwaffe, {{with varying degrees of}} success, carried out the strategic bombardment of British industrial cities. The lack of RAF night defences in this stage of the war enabled the German bombers to inflict extensive damage without suffering the heavy losses of the daylight campaign. It is estimated that the Luftwaffe lost around 500 aircrews during the Blitz in comparison to the Battle of Britain in which it lost around 2,800 killed, 340 wounded, 750 captured. Overall losses were cut by one-third of daylight operations.|$|E
5|$|D. Michael Harris and Jack Grimm {{had failed}} to find Titanic but their expeditions did succeed in {{producing}} fairly detailed mapping of {{the area in which}} the ship had sunk. It was clear that the position given in Titanics distress signals was inaccurate, which was a major expedition difficulty because it increased the search area's already-massive size. Despite the failure of his 1977 expedition, Robert Ballard had <b>not</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> hope and devised new technologies and a new search strategy to tackle the problem. The new technology was a system called Argo / Jason. This consisted of a remotely controlled deep-sea vehicle called Argo, equipped with sonar and cameras and towed behind a ship, with a robot called Jason tethered to it that could roam the sea floor, take close-up images and gather specimens. The images from the system would be transmitted back to a control room on the towing vessel where they could be assessed immediately. Although it was designed for scientific purposes, it also had important military applications and the United States Navy agreed to sponsor the system's development, on condition that it was to be used to carry out a number of programmes – many still classified – for the Navy.|$|E

The kingdom had by now been reduced to the Khabur Valley.

On , Swa again invaded northern Siam from Lan Na. It was essentially {{a repeat of the}} 1586 invasion except in the severity of defeat. Like in 1586, his army could not again get past the Lampang fort led by Naresuan. But unlike in 1586, it was no mere retreat. The 24-regiment, 20,000-man army was thoroughly defeated outside Lampang in March 1591. The remaining regiments arrived back in such disarray that Nanda verbally disparaged Mingyi Swa and executed some of the top generals.|$|E
25|$|Boxing was {{a popular}} spectator sport in Ancient Rome. In order for the fighters to protect {{themselves}} against their opponents they wrapped leather thongs around their fists. Eventually harder leather was used and the thong soon became a weapon. The Romans even introduced metal studs to the thongs to make the cestus which then led to a more sinister weapon called the myrmex ('limb piercer'). Fighting events were held at Roman Amphitheatres. The Roman form of boxing was often a fight until death to please the spectators who gathered at such events. However, especially in later times, purchased slaves and trained combat performers were valuable commodities, and their lives were <b>not</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> without due consideration. Often slaves were used against {{one another in a}} circle marked on the floor. This is where the term ring came from. In AD 393, during the Roman gladiator period, boxing was abolished due to excessive brutality. It was not until the late 16th century that boxing re-surfaced in London.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 the Waitangi Tribunal began {{hearings}} {{into the}} Ngāpuhi's claim that sovereignty was <b>not</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> in their {{signing of the}} Treaty of Waitangi. The Tribunal, in Te Paparahi o te Raki inquiry (Wai 1040), is considering the Māori and Crown understandings of He Whakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga / The Declaration of Independence 1835 and Te Tiriti o Waitangi / the Treaty of Waitangi. The Te Paparahi o Te Raki stage 1 inquiry hearings phase was intended to reach conclusions as to the meaning and effect of the treaty for the Crown and Te Raki Māori in 1840. The key conclusion of the stage 1 report was that the treaty signatories did not cede sovereignty in February 1840. ‘That is, they did not cede authority to make and enforce law over their people or their territories.’ The rangatira did, however, agree ‘to share power and authority with Britain’. The consequences of the findings in the stage 1 report are being considered in the Te Raki stage 2 inquiry including considering {{the immediate aftermath of}} the Treaty of Waitangi, the Northern War (1844–46) and Crown pre-emption.|$|E
