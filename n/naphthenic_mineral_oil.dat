40|$|Lubrication {{properties}} of refrigeration lubricants were investigated in high pressure nonconforming contacts under different conditions of temperature, rolling speed, and refrigerant concentration. The program {{was based upon}} the recognition that the lubrication regime in refrigeration compressors is generally elastohydrodynamic or hydrodynamic, {{as determined by the}} operating conditions of the compressor and the {{properties of}} the lubricant. Depending on the compressor design, elastohydrodynamic lubrication conditions exist in many rolling and sliding elements of refrigeration compressors such as roller element bearings, gears, and rotors. The formation of an elastohydrodynamic film separating rubbing surfaces is important in preventing the wear and failure of compressor elements. It is, therefore, important to predict the elastohydrodynamic (EHD) performance of lubricants under realistic tribocontact renditions. This is, however, difficult as the lubricant properties that control film formation are critically dependent upon pressure and shear, and cannot be evaluated using conventional laboratory instruments. In this study, the elastohydrodynamic behavior of refrigeration lubricants with and without the presence of refrigerants was investigated using the ultrathin film EHD interferometry technique. This technique enables very thin films, down to less than 5 nm, to be measured accurately within an EHD contact under realistic conditions of temperature, shear, and pressure. The technique was adapted to the study of lubricant refrigerant mixtures. Film thickness measurements were obtained on refrigeration lubricants as a function of speed, temperature, and refrigerant concentration. The effects of lubricant viscosity, temperature, rolling speed, and refrigerant concentration on EHD film formation were investigated. From the film thickness measurements, effective pressure-viscosity coefficients were calculated. The lubricants studied in this project included two <b>naphthenic</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>oils</b> (NMO), four polyolesters (POE), and two polyvinyl ether (PVE) fluids. These fluids represented viscosity grades of ISO 32 and ISO 68 and are shown in a table. Refrigerants studied included R- 22, R- 134 a, and R- 410 A. Film thickness measurements were conducted at 23 C, 45 C, and 65 C with refrigerant concentrations ranging from zero to 60 % by weight...|$|R

In this regime several formulas of the lubricant film thickness have been proposed by Hamrock and Dowson, by Dowson et al., and more recently by Houpert. However, either they do not include the load parameter W, which has a strong effect on film thickness, or they overestimate the film thickness by using the Barus formula for pressure-viscosity characteristics. The Roelands formula was used for the pressure-viscosity relationship. The effects of the dimensionless load, speed, and materials parameters, the radius ratio, and the lubricant entrainment direction were investigated. The dimensionless load parameter was varied over a range of one order of magnitude. The dimensionless speed parameter was varied by 5. 6 times the lowest value.

40|$|The {{research}} in this report {{is divided into two}} categories: (1) lubricant rheological behavior, and (2) thermal behavior of a simulated elastohydrodynamic contact. The studies of the lubricant rheological behavior consists of high pressure, low shear rate viscosity measurements, viscoelastic transition measurements, by volume dilatometry, dielectric transitions at atmospheric pressure and light scattering transitions. Lubricant shear stress-strain behavior in the amorphous glassy state was measured on several fluids. It appears clear from these investigations that many lubricants undergo viscoplastic transitions in typical EHD contacts and that the lubricant has a limiting maximum shear stress it can support which in turn will determine the traction in the contact except in cases of very low slide-roll ratio. Surface temperature measurements were made for a <b>naphthenic</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> and a polyphenyl ether. The maximum surface temperature in these experiments was approximately symmetrical about the zero slide-roll ration except for absolute values of slide-roll ratio greater than about 0. 9. Additional surface temperature measurements were made in contacts with rough surfaces where the composite surface roughness was approximately equal to the EHD film thickness. A regression analysis was done to obtain a predictive equation for surface temperatures as a function of pressure, sliding speed, and surface roughness. A correction factor for surface roughness effects to the typical flash temperature analysis was found...|$|E
40|$|This licentiate thesis {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of transient loading, at high pressures, on the pressure-dilatation relation and frictional properties of lubricants. A Split-Hopkinson pressure bar and a Ball and Bar apparatus {{have been used for}} the experiments. Both methods share the same type of evaluation approach: evaluation by analysis of wave propagation in structures. The advantage with this method is that results are presented as function of time, i. e. every experiment yields a history of the studied event, not just a single value. Different theoretical evaluation methods have been used and refinements have been made by introducing compensation terms in order to enhance accuracy. Several lubricants have been studied and an empirical second-degree polynomial has been suggested, for a <b>naphthenic</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> and a synthetic 5 P 4 E oil, describing the pressure-dilatation relation over a wide pressure range. It is found that 5 P 4 E exhibits lower compressibility, i. e. higher stiffness than the naphthenic oil. Curves representing friction coefficient as function of time for different lubricants at different pressures are included. It is evident that the Naphthenic- and Paraffinic mineral oils have the highest friction coefficient followed by Polyglycol, Polyalphaolefin and Rape seed oil. The observed distinctions agree well with the expected outcome on basis of molecular structure and pressure variation and correlates well with other density and friction investigations. A general trend of decreasing friction coefficient with increasing pressure is discovered. Godkänd; 2000; 20070318 (ysko...|$|E

This paper presents equilibrium pressure-temperature-concentration data experimentally measured for four refrigerant-oil mixtures. Baseline data are obtained for mixtures of R-I 21 <b>naphthenic</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> and R-I 2 /paraffmic mineral oil. These data are compared with results obtained for mixtures of R- 134 a/ester oil and R- 134 a/polyalkylene glycol (PAG). The solubility effects of synthetic lubricants in R- 134 a are less than for R- 12 and mineral oils. Using the experimental data, empirical models are developed to predict the solubility relations for each mixture at equilibrium. Raoult's Rule and Flory-Huggins theory are also used to predict mixture behavior. Idealized mixture enthalpies are calculated from pure component enthalpies and used to detennined evaporator capacity at a given inlet quality, pure refrigerant saturation temperature, and apparent degree of superheat at the evaporator outlet. Assuming standard operating conditions in a domestic refrigerator and mobile air conditioner, the reduction in evaporator capacity is consistently higher for mixtures of R- 12 and mineral oil.

Also reviewed were papers dealing with mixture properties; pool boiling, vapor space condensation, and adiabatic transport of refrigerant-oil mixtures; and past correlations for heat transfer and pressure drop;Experiments, using R- 22 as the working fluid, measured the heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop during evaporation and condensation of refrigerant and refrigerant-oil mixtures inside smooth and augmented tubes. <b>Naphthenic</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> (150 or 300 SUS) was added in concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 weight percent.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{lubricant}} miscibility and viscosity {{were evaluated by}} measuring the performance of an HFC- 134 a refrigeration system. The focus {{of this study is}} different from past studies which have been based on investigating system reliability in that is based on evaluating system efficiency, i. e., coefficient of performance;The vapor-compression refrigeration system used in this study contained a reciprocating compressor especially designed for the HFC- 134 refrigerant and a direct expansion evaporator coil with a rated capacity of 10 kW (3 tons). With respect to the refrigerant side heat transfer surface, two types of evaporator coils were tested, namely the microfin-tube type and the smooth-tube type;The effects of refrigerant/lubricant miscibility were investigated by comparing the performance of a miscible polyol ester lubricant (POE) and an immiscible <b>naphthenic</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> (MO) of similar viscosity grade. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the operating HFC- 134 a refrigeration system was found to be consistently higher, up to 5 percent, for the miscible POE lubricant compared to the immiscible mineral oil. The increased performance for the POE operation is attributed to an increased evaporation heat transfer rate for the POE lubricant. The results of other tested miscible lubricants also indicated superior system performance of miscible lubricants;The lubricant viscosity effects were investigated by comparing the HFC- 134 a system performance of two miscible POE lubricants of different viscosity grades, namely an ISO 22 and an ISO 32. The results show that both the COP and the capacity are generally higher, up to 3. 5 percent, for the system employing the lower viscosity POE. Again, these performance differences were correlated to the differences in the evaporation heat transfer rate with the lower viscosity lubricant indicating a higher evaporation heat transfer rate;A partially miscible POE was also evaluated, and it resulted in a reduced performance compared to a fully miscible lubricant, and thus, it was concluded that partial miscibility in the evaporator has a negative effect on system performance;In contrast to the evaporator performance, the effects of lubricant type on compressor efficiencies were not substantial, as evident by the observed differences in both the isentropic and the volumetric efficiencies between tested lubricants being rarely larger than the respective uncertainties;It was observed that the effect of the lubricant type on performance was more pronounced for the microfin-tube coil. The microfin-tube coil outperformed the smooth-tube coil by up to 10 percent in terms of the overall heat transfer coefficient. In addition, the performance enhancement (i. e. the heat transfer enhancement for the microfin tube coil compared to the smooth tube coil) is more pronounced for the miscible POE lubricant;In summary, lubricant selection should not only be based on system reliability but also on the system performance and efficiency as evident {{by the fact that the}} use of miscible lubricants and a lower viscosity lubricant resulted in improved performance...|$|E

This study more to measurement of the quantity {{needed to get the}} best product {{at the same time to}} know the minimum quantity where haven’t waste the lubricant itself. As knowing previously the <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> gave a big impact to the environment with too much pollution in the world. The non <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> currently, still in the research level because the effort to produce it is lower than <b>mineral</b> <b>oil.</b> Therefore to know the minimum quantity of non <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> can be used as lubricant is so important, because if get minimized the quantity used in the industry, it can help the usage of this lubricant will be expanded in the world. The best things is in this research the RBD palm oil was choose to represent the non-mineral <b>oil,</b> and <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> were represented by paraffinic <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> VG 460 and paraffinic <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> VG 95, where Malaysia is one of the countries have large of palm plant in the world. As long as this work can contributes greatly towards be Malaysia as one of the country produce lubricant from palm oil...|$|R
40|$|Of the {{numerous}} methods {{which have been}} used to intensify and prolong antibody production, I the technique of Le Moignic and Pinoy (1) with <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> {{has been found to be}} the most effective. It has been shown that in the presence of <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> emulsified in lanolin-like substances with or without the addition of killed acid-fast bacteria, there may ensue marked augmentation in the production of complement-fixing antibodies to tubercle bacilli (Freund and coworkers (2 - 4)), of precipitins to horse serum (5, 6) and influenza virus (Friedewaid (7, 8), Henle and Henle (9)), of agglufinins to typhoid bacilli and of antitoxins to diphtheria toxoid (Freund and Bonanto (10)). Recently <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> has been used to enhance the production of antibodies to dysentery antigen (Halbert, Mudd, and Smolens (11)). Several hypotheses have been postulated as to the mechanism of the augmenting action of <b>mineral</b> <b>oil.</b> Rist (12) who studied the tissue response to killed tubercle bacilli and <b>mineral</b> <b>oil,</b> found that bacilli alone produced merely a local reaction, <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> alone affected also the regional lymph node, while the combination of killed tubercle bacilli and <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> produced tubercle-like lesions in the regional lymph node and also in the lungs. On the basis of these findings, Rist came to the conclusion that the <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> had a twofold function: it maintaine...|$|R
