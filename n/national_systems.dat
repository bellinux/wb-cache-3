Under Roosevelt, their popularity soared, from three {{million visitors a year}} {{at the start of the}} decade to 15.5 million in 1939. The Civilian Conservation Corps enrolled 3.4 million young men and built 13,000 miles of trails, planted two billion trees, and upgraded 125,000 miles of dirt roads.

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, <b>national</b> <b>systems</b> of {{regulated}} asylums for {{the mentally}} ill had been established in most industrialized countries. At the turn of the century, Britain and France combined had only a few hundred people in asylums, but by {{the end of the}} century this number had risen to the hundreds of thousands. The United States housed 150,000 patients in mental hospitals by 1904. Germany housed more than 400 public and private sector asylums. These asylums were critical to the evolution of psychiatry as they provided places of practice throughout the world.|$|E

A case study of the San Pedro, an Arizona intermittent river, was conducted to determine if that river has Wild and Scenic potential.

25|$|The EU Trade Mark (EUTM) system (formerly the Community Trademark system) is the {{trademark}} system which applies in the European Union, whereby registration of a trademark with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO, formerly Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs)), {{leads to a}} registration which is effective throughout the EU as a whole. The EUTM system is therefore said to be unitary in character, in that an EUTM registration applies indivisibly across all European Union member states. However, the CTM system did not replace the national trademark registration systems; the CTM system and the <b>national</b> <b>systems</b> continue to operate in {{parallel to each other}} (see also European Union trade mark law).|$|E

500|$|The {{downturn}} in the United States economy in 1852 led Marx and Engels to wonder if a revolutionary upsurge would soon occur. However, the United States' economy was too new to play host to a classical revolution. The western frontier in America always provided a relief valve for the pent-up forces that might in other countries cause social unrest. Any economic crisis {{which began in the}} United States would not lead to revolution unless one of the older economies of Europe [...] "caught the contagion" [...] from the United States. In other words, economies of the world were still seen as individual <b>national</b> <b>systems</b> which were contiguous with the national borders of each country. The Panic of 1857 broke the mould of all prior thinking on the world economy. Beginning in the United States, the Panic spread across the globe. Indeed, the Panic of 1857 was the first truly global economic crisis.|$|E

2500|$|Unified English Braille (UEB) is an {{attempted}} unified standard for English Braille, proposed in 1991 to the Braille Authority of North America (BANA). The motivation for UEB {{was that the}} proliferation of specialized braille codes—which sometimes assigned conflicting values to even basic letters and numbers—was threatening not just braille-literacy, but also the viability of English braille itself. Also, the irregularities of English Braille made automated transcription inaccurate, and therefore increased the cost and time required to print in braille. In 1993, the UEB project {{was adopted by the}} International Council on English Braille, and expanded to cover the various <b>national</b> <b>systems</b> of the member states: [...] Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Nigeria, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. An additional goal became adoption of a single standard for all braille encoding, apart from music; with the exception of math-notation, this was largely achieved. [...] New Zealand officially retains Maori Braille as compatible with UEB, and BANA officially retains Nemeth Code as a math-notation option alongside UEB for the United States.|$|E
