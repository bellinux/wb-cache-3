500|$|Holly's {{performance}} of [...] "Turning Tables" [...] was considered {{inferior to the}} original. Futterman named it her least-favorite of Paltrow's covers to date and said that her vocals [...] "lacked the texture that made Adele's version so heartbreaking." [...] Gonzalez gave it her lowest grade of the episode, a [...] "B–", and Semigran opined that while Paltrow is [...] "a <b>nice</b> <b>enough</b> singer," [...] she [...] "in no way has the chops" [...] the song requires.

Slezak, however, said that Paltrow delivered a controlled, understated performance and CNN's Lisa Respers France simply deemed the performance memorable.

The season was distributed by Comedy Central, where the series has aired {{since its inception in}} 1997. Frank C. Agnone II served as supervising producer, while Eric Stough, Adrien Beard, Vernon Chatman, Bruce Howell and Erica Rivinoja worked as producers. Parker also served as director and writer for the thirteenth season. Saturday Night Live cast member Bill Hader, who had previously worked as a consultant on the show, was credited as a producer starting in season 13. Hader said of his role with the show, [...] "It's really Trey and Matt who kind of write everything, and you're just in the room kind of helping them.

500|$|Reviews of Bookends {{upon its}} release in 1968 were largely positive. Allen Evans of the British {{publication}} New Musical Express (NME) gave the record {{four out of}} five stars and called it [...] "inspiring, descriptive music," [...] while noting the album is [...] "Imaginative and at times confusing to know what the composer is getting at, if anything." [...] Rival newspaper Melody Maker did not use a ratings system, but called Bookends a [...] "thoughtful, clever and well-produced album." [...] Reviewer Chris Welch criticized the songs as [...] "not particularly tuneful," [...] but performed with [...] "Beatles fervour and Beatles conviction," [...] praising the lyricism, opining that [...] "The words capture part of America today, a lot of its sickness and tragedy." [...] In the US, Rolling Stone reviewer Arthur Schmidt wrote that [...] "The music is, for me, questionable, but I've always found their music questionable. It is <b>nice</b> <b>enough,</b> and I admit to liking it, but it exudes a sense of process, and it is slick, and nothing too much happens." ...|$|E

[...] The use of pizza delivery by Papa John's Pizza in the film was regarded by Common Sense Media, a media website for parents, reviewer Heather Boerner, as [...] "overly integrated product placement". [...] She criticized the product placement, writing, [...] "Not only is the pizza delivery guy included {{in more than half}} of the DVD, but the logo is present and the kids are shown munching ecstatically on the pizza at the end of the movie. [...] They even say that the pizza is great, and how the delivery guy was <b>nice.</b> It's <b>enough</b> to make a commercial-conscious parent gag".|$|R
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B–". He criticized {{the characterization of}} Andy {{and said that the}} character had [...] "hit a plateau when his fist went through that wall in season three" [...] and represented [...] "a grinning puppet who can be imbued with some of Michael Scott's leftover tics and remind people he went to Cornell". However, Adams enjoyed the episode's subplots and wrote that the episode really [...] "gave me a better picture of what makes Andy's girlfriend tick." [...] Furthermore, he praised many of her lines and her acting ability. Damon Houx of ScreenCrush said that the episode was a [...] "surprisingly strong Erin episode" [...] and that [...] "Dwight acting crazy was also well used". Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five and called it [...] "a <b>nice</b> <b>enough</b> holiday episode". He was critical of the episode's Jim and Pam subplot, saying that it could have [...] "been left on the cutting room floor." [...] IGN reviewer Cindy White awarded the episode a 7.9 rating, denoting a [...] "good" [...] episode. She wrote that while the story had its limitations, [...] "Little lines and bits ... helped elevate 'Here Comes Treble.|$|E

"Turning Tables" [...] {{was covered}} by American actress and singer Gwyneth Paltrow, in the [...] "A Night of Neglect" [...] episode of the Fox Broadcasting Company {{television}} show Glee.

Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone named it her least-favorite of Paltrow's covers to date and said that her vocals [...] "lacked the texture that made Adele's version so heartbreaking."

Whilst The Wall Street Journals Raymund Flandez called it a [...] "scene-stealing turn" [...] and commended it visually and vocally, he noted that Paltrow lacks Adele's veracity. Released as a single, this version peaked at number 66 on US Billboard Hot 100 and Canadian Hot 100. As of 2 July 2012, the Glee version had sold 113,000 paid downloads in the US alone.

2500|$|The {{literature}} {{is not entirely}} uniform in its terminology as to exactly which properties of infinite-dimensional groups qualify the group for the prefix Lie in Lie group.

That is, there may be a group corresponding to the Lie algebra, but it might not be <b>nice</b> <b>enough</b> to be called a Lie group, or the connection between the group and the Lie algebra might not be <b>nice</b> <b>enough</b> (for example, failure of the exponential map to be onto a neighborhood of the identity).

40|$|From the Introduction. The {{results of}} Nice {{open the way}} for the {{beginning}} of EU Enlargement after the ratification of the Treaty of Nice, which means as early as 2003. This result proves that "deepening" and "widening" of the European Union remain intrinsically related, as has always been the case since the founding of the European Economic Community in 1957. The process of institution building in the European Union has certainly not come to a close. The leftovers of <b>Nice</b> are difficult <b>enough.</b> The <b>Nice</b> decisions have only shown the need for further and substantial institutional reforms in the European Union. In fact, the EU is forced to link a continuous commitment to its constitution-building with the rapidly approaching enlargement to Central and Eastern European countries – better: the anchoring of post-communist reform countries in the West. Further institutional adaptations and a definite enlargement towards Central and Eastern Europe force the EU to find ways and means to efficiently work with 27 or even more Union States and to make the EU capable of playing its role {{in the world of the}} twenty-first century...|$|R
