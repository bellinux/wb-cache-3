50|$|A TVP is {{a direct}} {{projection}} of a high-dimensional tensor to a low-dimensional vector, which is {{also referred to as}} the rank-one projections. As TVP projects a tensor to a vector, it can be viewed as multiple projections from a tensor to a scalar. Thus, the TVP of a tensor to a P-dimensional vector consists of P projections from the tensor to a scalar. The projection from a tensor to a scalar is an elementary multilinear projection (EMP). In EMP, a tensor is projected to a point through <b>N</b> <b>unit</b> projection vectors. It is the projection of a tensor on a single line (resulting a scalar), with one projection vector in each mode. Thus, the TVP of a tensor object to a vector in a P-dimensional vector space consists of P EMPs. This projection is an extension of the canonical decomposition, also known as the parallel factors (PARAFAC) decomposition.|$|E

40|$|The contact graph of an {{arbitrary}} finite packing of unit balls in Euclidean 3 -space is the (simple) graph whose vertices {{correspond to the}} packing elements and whose two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding two packing elements touch each other. One {{of the most basic}} questions on contact graphs is to find the maximum number of edges that a contact graph of a packing of <b>n</b> <b>unit</b> balls can have. In this paper, improving earlier estimates, we prove that the number of touching pairs in {{an arbitrary}} packing of <b>n</b> <b>unit</b> balls in E 3 is always less than 6 n− 0. 926 n 23. Moreover, as a natural extension of the above problem, we propose to study the maximum number of touching triplets (resp., quadruples) in an arbitrary packing of <b>n</b> <b>unit</b> balls in Euclidean 3 -space. In particular, we prove that the number of touching triplets (resp., quadruples) in an arbitrary packing of <b>n</b> <b>unit</b> balls in E 3 is at most 2...|$|E

Thus, we have to define which units belong to each stratum so as to minimize the variance of a total estimator for one desired variable of interest in each stratum, and consequently reduce the overall variance for such quantity. In order to solve this problem, an exact algorithm based on the concept of minimal path in a graph is proposed and assessed.
