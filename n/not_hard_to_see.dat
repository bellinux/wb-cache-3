Dwyer and Kan obtain a mapping space between two objects, where Gabriel and Zisman obtain only the set of homotopy classes of maps i. e. the ss 0 of the mapping space.

Holism about reasons is distinguished into a weak version, which allows for invariant reasons, and a strong, which doesn't. Four problems with Dancy's arguments for strong holism are identified. (1) A plausible particularism based on it will be close to generalism. (2) Dancy rests his case on common-sense morality, without justifying it. (3) His examples are of non-ultimate reasons. (4) There are certain universal principles it is <b>hard</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> as invariant, such as {{that the fact that}} some action causes of suffering to a non-rational being always counts against it.
