5|$|The 1906 {{exhibition}} of Gauguin's work left Picasso {{more than ever}} in this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides—could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping a <b>new</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> divine energy.|$|E
5|$|Two of Daniels' other tax {{proposals}} were approved: {{a tax on}} liquor and beverages to fund {{the construction of the}} Lucas Oil Stadium and a tax on rental cars to expand the Indiana Convention Center. The <b>new</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> funding resulted in a state take-over of a project initially started by the City of Indianapolis and led to a bitter feud between Daniels and the city leadership over who should have ownership of the project. The state ultimately won and took ownership of the facilities from the city.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, Julian founded his own {{research}} firm, Julian Laboratories, Inc. He brought {{many of his}} best chemists, including African-Americans and women, from Glidden to his own company. Julian won a contract to provide Upjohn with $2 million worth of progesterone (equivalent to $ million today). To compete against Syntex, {{he would have to}} use the same Mexican yam Mexican barbasco trade as his starting material. Julian used his own money and borrowed from friends to build a processing plant in Mexico, but he could not get a permit from the government to harvest the yams. Abraham Zlotnik, a former Jewish University of Vienna classmate whom Julian had helped escape from the Holocaust, led a search to find a <b>new</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the yam in Guatemala for the company.|$|E
5|$|Motor symptoms, if not treated, advance aggressively in {{the early}} stages of the disease and more slowly later. Untreated, {{individuals}} are expected to lose independent ambulation after an average of eight years and be bedridden after ten years. However, it is uncommon to find untreated people nowadays. Medication has improved the prognosis of motor symptoms, while at the same time it is a <b>new</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> disability, because of the undesired effects of levodopa after years of use. In people taking levodopa, the progression time of symptoms to a stage of high dependency from caregivers may be over 15 years. However, it is hard to predict what course the disease will take for a given individual. Age is the best predictor of disease progression. The rate of motor decline is greater in those with less impairment at the time of diagnosis, while cognitive impairment is more frequent in those who are over 70 years of age at symptom onset.|$|E
5|$|Natural gas {{was first}} found in Indiana in 1876 {{but it was}} not until 1886 that the {{magnitude}} of the discovery was known; the Trenton Gas Field was the largest deposit of natural gas discovered in the 19th century and the first giant oil reserve found in the United States. As a professor at a university in the Trenton Field, Haynes offered his services to the drillers and worked to analyze soil samples, determine well pressure, and give estimates on the amount of energy that could be created by the gas. He delivered several lectures to large crowds about the importance of the gas discovery and the many possible applications of this <b>new</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> fuel. He began a petition to have the local citizens create a corporation to pump the fuel from the ground and pipe it to area homes and businesses. His promotion was successful and Portland Natural Gas and Oil Company was formed; Haynes' father was named to the new company's board of directors.|$|E

5|$|Other Japanese games, {{particularly}} Guitar Freaks, led {{to development}} of Guitar Hero and Rock Band series that used instrument-shaped controllers {{to mimic the}} playing of actual instruments. Spurred by the inclusion of popular rock music, the two series revitalized the rhythm genre in the Western Market, significantly expanded the console video game market and its demographics. The games provided a <b>new</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> revenue for the artists whose music appeared on the soundtracks. The later release of Rock Band 3 {{as well as the}} even later Rocksmith would allow players to play the songs using a real electric guitar. By 2008, rhythm games were considered {{to be one of the}} most popular video game genres, behind other action games. However, by 2009, the market was saturated by spin-offs from the core titles, which led to a nearly 50% drop in revenue for music game publishers; within a few years, both series announced they would be taking a hiatus from future titles.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Böcker {{and then}} WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne {{director}} Winfried Fechner began collaborating on orchestrated video game concerts in 2007, after Fechner had attended the Fifth Symphonic Game Music Concert held in Leipzig. As {{their ideas and}} plans materialized, three projects were set in motion to determine the interest of a younger audience in classical music performance and the aptitude of the WDR orchestra in focusing on a <b>new</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> compositions. The first project was PROMS: That's Sound, That's Rhythm, held in early 2008, featuring a mixture of classical works and video game music, ranging from works by Ralph Vaughan Williams and Morton Gould as well as arrangements of music from video games such as Shenmue and Castlevania previously featured in the Symphonic Game Music Concerts. The second project, held in August 2008, was a composer specific concert titled Symphonic Shades - Hülsbeck in Concert, focusing entirely on the works of German video game composer Chris Hülsbeck. After the concert, Fechner revealed in an interview {{the existence of the}} third project, saying that he and Böcker would be involved in another concert of video game music the following September. The third project was to be a concert of music from one game company, focusing on multiple titles released by the same developer. This company was later confirmed to be Square Enix when Fechner announced Symphonic Fantasies as a video game music concert to take place on September 12, 2009. A website was set up for announcements, interviews and other concert information.|$|E

Eager to discover new horizons, Gasté sailed for India and Ceylon, which for him became a <b>new</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> inspiration for his paintings.
