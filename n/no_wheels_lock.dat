40|$|For {{construction}} equipment in general fuel efficiency {{is one of}} the most critical product attributes. Pure fuel economy improvements from the engines are extremely expensive to develop. This creates an incitement for development of hybrid technology. This thesis was done in corporation with CPAC Systems in Gothenburg, Sweden. With regenerative braking, the energy that is normally transferred into heat during braking can be stored in a battery or a super capacitor and the stored energy can later be used for propulsion. However the regenerative braking also affects the vehicle dynamics and the driver’s interpretation of the brake pedal which demands for a physical test platform for testing. In this thesis a test platform for testing of concepts was developed and built and a brake blending system was developed and tested on the test platform. The test platform was built in small scale compared to a full wheel loader with an articulated rideable lawn mower as base. A small scale test platform has the benefits of fast and easy testing and much lower cost compared to a full scale wheel loader. The test platform is equipped with individual wheel motors and a mechanical brake system based on brakes from a motorcycle. The first step in the development of the control system for the test platform was to make Simulink models for the components in the test platform. Models for the overall vehicle, the brakes and the electrical motors were developed. From the models a control strategy was developed to control the requested torque to the electric motors and the requested brake pressure to the brakes from the driver’s inputs. The control strategy was developed in Simulink and from Simulink C-code was automatically generated by the code generation tool TargetLink. All testing including testing of the brake blending system was performed on the test platform. The result of this thesis is a test platform that is built to emulate a small scale hybrid wheel loader. The test platform is expandable and can be used to test other concepts, for example steer-by-wire. The other result of the thesis is a brake blending system that is combining electrical and mechanical braking with good pedal feeling, <b>no</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>lock</b> and high energy regeneration...|$|R

40|$|In {{maturing}} rats, {{the growth}} of abdominal fat is attenuated by voluntary wheel running. After the cessation of running by <b>wheel</b> <b>locking,</b> a rapid increase in adipose tissue growth to a size {{that is similar to}} rats that have never run (i. e. catch-up growth) has been previously reported by our lab. In contrast, diet-induced increases in adiposity have a slower onset with relatively delayed transcriptomic responses. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to identify molecular pathways associated with the rapid increase in adipose tissue after ending 6 wks of voluntary running at the time of puberty. Age-matched, male Wistar rats were given access to running wheels from 4 to 10 weeks of age. From the 10 th to 11 th week of age, one group of rats had continued wheel access, while the other group had one week of <b>wheel</b> <b>locking.</b> Perirenal adipose tissue was extracted, RNA sequencing was performed, and bioinformatics analyses were executed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). IPA was chosen to assist in the understanding of complex 'omics data by integrating data into networks and pathways. <b>Wheel</b> <b>locked</b> rats gained significantly more fat mass and significantly increased body fat percentage between weeks 10 - 11 despite having decreased food intake, as compared to rats with continued wheel access. IPA identified 646 known transcripts differentially expressed (p < 0. 05) between continued wheel access and <b>wheel</b> <b>locking.</b> In <b>wheel</b> <b>locked</b> rats, IPA revealed enrichment of transcripts for the following functions: extracellular matrix, macrophage infiltration, immunity, and pro-inflammatory.

Childhood is a critical time of growth, and decisions made during this time lead to positive and negative health consequences, specifically pertaining to adiposity. There is convincing evidence that children who are overweight and obese are at higher risk for adult obesity and risk factors associated with obesity for their whole life course. Puberty is a critical time of adipose tissue expansion, and it is accepted by most that this is the age where the number of adipocytes is set for adulthood. Further it is believed that before puberty, adipose tissue expands by hyperplasia, while after puberty, adipose tissue expands by hypertrophy. The time leading up to puberty represents a critical time. Yet, {{little is known about the}} interaction between age, physical activity, and adipose tissue expansion in young, growing animals. Thus, I employed a unique model of childhood obesity to test whether: 1) seven days of decreased physical activity (<b>wheel</b> <b>lock)</b> in 49 - 56 day old rats and 70 - 77 day old rats would result in gains in visceral adipose mass seen in age-matched sedentary rats concurrent with an increase in adipocyte size and inflammatory mRNA expression (Chapter 2), and 2) glucocorticoid block would attenuate the visceral adipose depot gains seen with <b>wheel</b> <b>lock</b> in rats at sexual maturity (Chapter 3). Here, I present evidence that the age at which <b>wheel</b> <b>lock</b> occurs influences visceral adipose tissue growth and propose a mechanism for this growth at two ages of pre-pubertal growth (49 - 56 days of age and 70 - 77 days of age). Specifically, rats that undergo <b>wheel</b> <b>lock</b> for 7 days at 49 - 56 days of age show no differences in total body mass, mean adipocyte diameter, or mass of omental, epididymal, and perirenal adipose tissue depots compared to rats that remained physically active. However, rats that undergo <b>wheel</b> <b>lock</b> for 7 days at 70 - 77 days of age have an increased rate of body mass, fat mass, and % body fat gained and have increased depot mass and total number of adipocytes in epididymal and perirenal adipose tissue,...|$|R
