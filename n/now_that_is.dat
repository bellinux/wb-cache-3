We often call those shifts revolutions because people revolt against old and outmoded ways of doing things in favor of new approaches, new technologies and new ideas that better meet the needs of the time. We have experienced revolutions in information technology, travel and communication. There is one going on <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> symbolized by the introduction of iPhones this past week; we know what this one is about. But there is another revolution going on related to choosing a college -- and the role that public rankings play in that choice -- that may be less clear." ...|$|E

[...] Newt Gingrich said, [...] "All the Occupy movements starts with the premise that we all owe them everything. <b>Now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a pretty good symptom of how much the left has collapsed as a moral system in this country and why you need to reassert something as simple as saying to them, go get a job right after you take a bath."

2500|$|The Review began {{a year-long}} celebration of its 50th anniversary with a {{presentation}} by Silvers and several contributors at The Town Hall in New York City in February 2013. Other events included a {{program at the}} New York Public Library in April, called [...] "Literary Journalism: A Discussion", focusing on the editorial process at the Review and a reception in November at the Frick Collection. During the year, Martin Scorsese filmed a documentary about the history and influence of the Review, and the debates that it has spawned, titled The 50 Year Argument, which premiered in June 2014 at the Sheffield Doc/Fest. It was later seen at various film festivals, on BBC television and on HBO in the US. Asked how he maintained his [...] "level of meticulousness and determination" [...] after 50 years, Silvers said that the Review [...] "was and is a unique opportunity ... to do what one wants on anything in the world. <b>Now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> given to hardly any editor, anywhere, anytime. There are no strictures, no limits. Nobody saying you can't do something. No subject, no theme, no idea that can’t be addressed in-depth. ... Whatever work is involved is minor compared to the opportunity." [...] A special 50th anniversary issue was dated November 7, 2013. Silvers said: ...|$|E

[...] In Wittgenstein's Culture and Value, it is found, [...] "Is what I am doing [...] really worth the effort? Yes, but only if a light shines on it from above." [...] His close friend Norman Malcolm would write, [...] "Wittgenstein’s mature life was strongly marked by religious thought and feeling. I am inclined to think that he was more deeply religious than are many people who correctly regard themselves as religious believers." [...] At last, Wittgenstein writes, [...] "Bach wrote on the title page of his Orgelbuechlein, ‘To the glory of the most high God, and that my neighbour may be benefited thereby.’ [...] That is what I would have liked to say about my work." ...|$|E
