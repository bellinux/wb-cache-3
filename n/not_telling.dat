5|$|After {{it first}} came to light in October, {{it was found that}} it had been posted to YouTube several months earlier, along with a {{similarly}} threatening message in binary code. The poster of that video, known as AETBX, has suggested to inquiring journalists that GadgetZZ is <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> the truth about how it came to possess the video. Internet investigators managed to establish that it was filmed in the former Zofiówka Sanatorium outside Otwock, Poland, sometime between November 2013 and the video's release.|$|E

Shane discovers Carl's presence and scolds him. Outside, Carol (Melissa McBride) attempts to cheer Carl up by reminding him Sophia is in heaven, but he lashes out at her. Carl ends up taking a gun from Daryl's stash and heading into the nearby swamp alone. He finds a walker half-stuck in mud, and taunts it by throwing rocks at it and then moves in close to shoot it in the head. The walker suddenly frees one of its legs and lurches forward; Carl panics and drops the gun before running back to camp, <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> anyone what happened.

5|$|In Zoha Prison in Romania, {{there are}} {{interviews}} with traffickers serving prison sentences {{that the film}} suggested were too short {{in light of the}} severity of the crime of human trafficking. The typical sentence for this crime is six or seven years, while the sentence for trafficking in drugs is normally twenty years. Two Romanian traffickers, Traian and Ovidiu, attest to having starved, punched, and kicked the girls they trafficked. Ovidiu recounts a story, in an interview filmed in February 2007, about kidnapping a prostitute and selling her for sex when he was 14. He expresses no remorse for these actions. The sentences served by Traian and Ovidiu were short enough that, by the time the film was released, they were no longer in prison. Ana, a girl they trafficked, is also interviewed in the film, saying that she lost a tooth in one of her beatings. She describes being pregnant at the time, but <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> this to her captors because of fears for the unborn child's safety.|$|E
5|$|Jerry still {{worries about}} Elaine, but Harold and Manny inform him {{that someone else}} has bid higher than Elaine and will get the {{apartment}} unless Elaine is able to pay $5,000. Elaine is very disappointed when she hears the news. However, Kramer convinces Jerry to lend Elaine the money. When Elaine, Jerry and George {{go to a party}} of a friend of Elaine, Elaine asks Jerry if it would be uncomfortable for them to live so close to each other, but Jerry says he does not worry. George's wedding ring plan backfires, as he discovers that wearing the ring is actually causing women who would otherwise date him to reject him. Jerry feels stupid for <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> Elaine the truth, but, the following day, Kramer informs him that he found somebody who is willing to pay $10,000 for the apartment. However, Kramer's friend, a musician, plays loud music all day long, and Jerry regrets not letting Elaine rent the apartment.|$|E

5|$|Spider-Man 3 premiered on April 16, 2007 in Tokyo, and was {{released}} in the United States in both conventional and IMAX theaters on May 4, 2007. The film grossed $890.9 million worldwide, making it the most successful film of the trilogy financially and the second film in the franchise that {{was released}} on IMAX. However, it received mixed reviews; while the effects and action scenes were praised, aspects of the plot (such as Harry's butler knowing how his father really died and <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> him), {{and the use of}} three villains (especially the treatment of Venom) were criticized. A fourth film, titled Spider-Man 4, was set to be released on May 6, 2011, but was canceled in favor of the 2012 reboot The Amazing Spider-Man.|$|E
5|$|When Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is irritated that Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{will not}} fulfill his {{landlord}} responsibilities and fix the dangerously substandard office wiring, {{he comes up}} with a plan to pretend that magnetic power is affecting the office and thus get the repairs as well as a week off from work for his wife Pam (Jenna Fischer) (whom he is trying to be extra nice to in the wake of <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> her about his new job plans). Dwight calls Jim's bluff and rents an overcrowded bus for the staff to work on, but Jim harnesses the office workers' love of a local pie stand to please Pam. Dwight eventually gets angry and climbs into the roof of the bus, refusing to drive any further. Pam suspects something else is wrong and asks Jim to talk to him. Jim learns that Dwight thought his magnetic power prank was real as he suspects he is infertile, which he has convinced himself explains why he was not the father of Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) baby. Jim tells Dwight he is like a father to the entire office, and Dwight then drives everyone to the pie stand where they have a great finish to their day.|$|E
5|$|After <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> {{anyone about}} hitting Delia, Adam fears the {{investigation}} is closing in on him. He names Jack Connor's godfather and makes him promise to protect him should anything happen to him, and then proposes to Chelsea again and asks her to move to Paris with him, like they had planned during their first marriage. At the same time, Victor's private investigation on the hit-and-run driver leads him to Adam. He agrees to not turn him in {{as long as he}} can take part in Connor's life; a role he had initially refused him. Adam agrees as he and Chelsea remarry. Days before their flight to Paris, Delia's father Billy Abbott (Billy Miller) puts the pieces together and realizes Adam is the one who killed his daughter. He holds him at gunpoint and demands he drive them to places where milestones in Delia's life occurred. While driving, Adam attempts to grab the gun as a shot is fired and the car drives off a ravine. One of them staggers away from the crash and collapses, revealed to be Billy. Nick and Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) find the overturned vehicle as it catches fire and explodes. Adam's body is thrown from the vehicle, is not recovered and he is presumed dead, devastating Chelsea just as news that Adam killed Delia breaks. However, Adam's bloody hand is later shown to be moving, alluding that he survived. Soon after, he is shown to be lying in a bed, being held captive by an unknown captor. Later Victor informs Chelsea that his investigators have found Adam's remains, but elsewhere Adam is seen paying off Victor's investigator, confirming that Adam has faked his death.|$|E

25|$|Wilson became {{increasingly}} concerned that Tudor, with the connivance of Lloyd George, {{who loved to}} drop hints to that effect, was operating an unofficial policy of killing IRA men in reprisal {{for the deaths of}} pro-Crown forces. Wilson wrote to Macready (June 1920) that “the discipline and good name of the Army is worth half a dozen Irelands” – although sympathetic, he had been deeply concerned to hear of troops smashing up Fermoy in reprisal for the kidnapping of General Cuthbert. However, Macready also told Wilson that the Army was arranging “accidents” for suspected IRA men, but <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> the politicians as he did not want them “talked and joked about after dinner by Cabinet Ministers”. Lloyd George refused to formally declare martial law, not least because in July 1920 the Amritsar Massacre (of April 1919) was being debated by Parliament.|$|E

In the season finale it was decided that they will close down Oceanside Wellness and open another practice; and Naomi decides {{it would be best to}} move to New York to be with Gabriel.|$|E
