40|$|Owing to {{the steep}} dose {{fall-off}} curves of high {{precision and accuracy}} radiation therapy (RT) modalities such as stereotactic body RT (SBRT), treatment plans with extraordinarily small margins to organs at risk (OARs), such as the spinal cord, has been made possible. With this development, patient movements during treatment, i. e. intrafraction motion (IFM), must be monitored more closely. This master thesis was aimed at developing an A-mode ultrasound prototype to detect the motions of the cervical spine {{as part of an}} IFM management (IFMM) system. Current IFMM systems have several drawbacks, including invasiveness and indirect measurements. The existing prototype was tested in order to identify areas of improvement. The prototype developed was equipped with a preconditioning circuit that retains the frequency information of the signal. Furthermore, software was developed based on wavelet filtering and enveloping using the Hilbert transform. Multiple logic algorithms were added in order to handle lost signals, competing echoes, echoes from soft tissues etc. The newly-developed prototype was found to have higher accuracy and precision than the pre-existing prototype. It was also more robust when measuring distance to the spine. A difficulty in segmenting the echo for bone arises for low quality signals. Therefore a compromise exists between setup time, including probe adjustment, and signal quality. Future work includes the manufacturing of a new <b>neck</b> <b>rest</b> to enable robust probe adjustment and fixation...|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{fields in}} IMRT and {{optimization}} allow conformal dose {{to the target}} and reduced dose to the surroundings and the regions of interest. Thus we can escalate the dose to the target to achieve better tumor control with low morbidity. Orientation of multiple beams {{can be achieved by}} i) different gantry angles, ii) rotating patient&#x 2032;s couch isocentrically. In doing so, one or more beam may pass through different materials like the treatment couch, immobilization cast fixation plate, head and <b>neck</b> <b>rest</b> or any other supportive device. Our observations for 6 MV photon beam on PRIMUS-KXE 2 with MED-TEC carbon fiber tabletop and 10 x 10 cm 2 field size reveals that the maximum dose attenuation by the couch was of the order of 2. 96 &#x 0025; from gantry angle 120 - 160 &#x 00 B 0;. Attenuation due to cast fixation base plate of PMMA alone was of the order of 5. 8 - 10. 55 &#x 0025; at gantry angle between 0 and 90 &#x 00 B 0;. Attenuation due to carbon fiber base plate alone was 3. 8 - 7. 98 &#x 0025;. Attenuation coefficient of carbon fiber and PMMA was evaluated and was of the order of 0. 082 cm- 1 and 0. 064 cm- 1 respectively. Most of the TPS are configured for direct beam incidence attenuation correction factors only. Whereas when the beam is obliquely incident on the couch, base plate, headrest and any other immobilization device get attenuated more than the direct beam incidence. The correction factors for oblique incidence beam attenuation are not configured in most of the commercially available treatment planning systems. Therefore, such high variations in dose delivery could lead to under-dosage to the target volume for treatments requiring multiple fields in IMRT and 3 D-CRT and need to be corrected for monitor unit calculations...|$|E
40|$|Today {{there is}} a large amount of {{knowledge}} about ergonomics and working sitting postures during long hours of office computer work. There is also a large selection of office chairs available on the market with numerous possibilities of individual adjustments for optimal and varied sitting postures. For the manufacturers it is of great interest to show advantages such as increased productivity, decreased discomfort and reduced physical disorders as well as improved health and well-being when their ergonomic chairs are used at work. For optimal usage {{it is important that the}} users take advantage of all the ergonomic features offered. However, often problems arise when a chair has a large amount of settings with various design and functionality. It is difficult without instructions and training to understand how the various settings work and how they should be handled and adjusted optimally for a specific individual. The purpose of this study was to examine if the possibilities that the RH Logic 400 office chair offers to create an ergonomic, individual and varied working posture were employed optimally by the users and also what effects the features had on comfort and work performance. The goal was to determine if positive effects regarding comfort, health and performance arise during 5 weeks of office computer work. Furthermore the goal was to find out how the RH chair and its adjustments were perceived and handled by the users when they were informed in different ways during introduction of the chair in their company. 84 office computer workers at two companies participated in the study during a period of five weeks. 48 of workers got the RH Logic 400 office chair, while the others kept their ordinary office chairs. These functioned as a control group. Among the RH chair users, 28 received an verbal introduction/training session of the chair’s functions from a manufacturer sales person together with a physiotherapist. The others only got access to a small written information brochure from the manufacturer hanging under the chair. Before the study all participants filled in a comprehensive questionnaire about their personal data, working situation and health status. Then they answered a questionnaire each week during a five weeks period about their health and well-being status as well as if the had adjusted their chair and used its features. Finally another comprehensive questionnaire was filled out when the test period was finished. In total 18000 data points were collected from 7 questionnaires (together including 82 questions with sub-questions). The data was statistically analysed using Wilcoxons signed-rank test and Student’s t-test. The significant level was set to 5 %. The concluding results from the study showed that the RH Logic 400 chair significantly decreased the physical strain in the neck, shoulder and lumbar regions, and for the shoulders on the right hand side. People with previous long-term physical problems in the upper part of their body perceived decreased distress after five weeks work in the RH chair. The sitting posture and the comfort were perceived better for the RH chair than in the test subjects’ previous chair. They also felt more relaxed in the RH chair. However the chair and back cushions of the RH chair were perceived stiffer than in their previous chair. The RH office chair had a positive impact on the working situation as a whole, but did not affect the stress level at work. When discussing work performance and stress all parts in the working environment have an effect on well-being and it is therefore difficult to separate effects from the chair. The understanding about how the adjustments of the RH chair should be performed, as well as usage of the rocking function, increased significantly when verbal presentation and training were given, as well as how often the adjustments were used. However, when the users had found suitable settings, they did seldom adjust their chairs again during the test period. Sitting height was the measure that most often was adjusted while the positions of the <b>neck</b> <b>rest</b> and arm rests seldom were changed. The recommendation from this study is that when delivering office chairs to customers it is very important to introduce the users on how to adjust and handle the chair to accomplish optimal individual settings. Also point out that the chair should be adjusted several times a day and the rocking function should be used frequently to achieve necessary posture changes. Furthermore, explicit written information material need to be developed, explaining how good individual ergonomic working postures can be found by adjusting the chair’s different settings properly and also in which order the settings should be performed. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{constantly}} {{increasing number}} of advanced driver assistance systems are implemented in cars. The driver is required to interpret the data reported by these systems while driving, and thereforeit {{is important to know}} how the information signals provided by such systems affect the driver. Driving relies to a large extent on vision, and most current advanced driver assistance systemsuse visual information, requiring visual attention from the driver. This conflicts with the drivingtask and leads to an increase in inattention and in cognitive and visual workload. Off-loadingvisually demanding tasks to other sensory modalities should be beneficial in terms of the driver’sability to divide attention resources. The aim of this thesis is to gain knowledge on how the driveris affected by information and interaction with driver assistance systems utilising 3 D auditorydisplays. The goal is to provide knowledge of how to create robust interfaces that assist the driverwhile maintaining the necessary safety aspects while driving. The first paper investigated the importance of sound source placement within the car compartment. Since sound can be a very effective means of capturing attention, it could cause dangeroussituations if used in the wrong way. If sound is used to draw attention, one must be sure to notdraw the driver’s attention away from something more critical. The study showed that soundcan improve attention to the road when the sound source location is in front of the driver. Previous research has shown that a combination of sensory modalities increase the robustnessof perception. To avoid additional load on the visual modality, the second paper investigatedthe usefulness of vibrotactile information, in combination with auditory and/or visual signals. There was no significant increase in performance when adding vibration to a sound signal, butvibration and sound on their own led to similar performance. It can be argued, however, thatcombinations are still useful since they reduce the risk of an important signal being missed orneglected. In this investigation, all signals containing a visual component provided the fastestresponse time. The third paper investigated the usefulness of a 3 D auditory display applied on a parking assistancesystem. A user study was conducted to evaluate drivers’ workload and performancewhen using different system implementations. It was found that a 3 D auditory display was wellreceived as long as the sound only came from one direction at a time. Providing too much informationto the driver by using simultaneous sound sources at different locations was perceived asconfusing and annoying. In some cases, the effort required to perform a successful parking wassignificantly reduced when using a 3 D auditory display system compared to a traditional parkingassistance system using only two sound sources. There were also indications that 3 D soundcan reduce drivers’ mental workload and frustration with parking assistance systems. Placing sound sources in the car where they are most suitable can be difficult, especially if soundsources outside the car are required. The fourth paper investigated if {{it would be possible to}} use acrosstalk cancellation technique in combination with binaural recordings to reproduce 3 D audiousing only two loudspeakers in the car compartment. It was found that when the loudspeakersare placed close to the ears of the driver, crosstalk cancellation can be effective inside the car compartment by avoiding strong reflections. Closely placed loudspeakers reduce filter creationcomplexity and improve sound quality. The fifth paper tackles the problems of within-the-head perception and front-back confusion,commonly found in binaural recordings and synthesis. It has been shown that reverberant binauralsounds are perceived more externalised than anechoic sounds, and tend to suffer less fromfront-back confusion. However, information sound signals should rarely be reverberant. Theidea was to create an image-source model with focus on early reflections and compare it withtraditional artificial head recordings. The image-source model performed better than the artificialhead recordings in terms of front-back confusion, and at the same time considerably limitedthe inherent room acoustics in the sound. In conclusion, meaningful and informative sound signals can raise driving performance if theyare placed in front of the driver. This encourages the driver to maintain focus on the road, byusing the attention capture capabilities of sound. A 3 D auditory display can be beneficial forsystems such as parking assistance, since it helps lowering driver effort, mental workload andfrustration. Also, 3 D auditory displays increase the drivers’ sense of safety and comfort, by augmentingthe drivers’ surrounding and thereby increasing their situational awareness. If a 3 Dauditory display should be implemented in the car, a transaural system with crosstalk cancellationshowed promise for virtual sound source reproduction. However, binaural synthesis hasinherent problems that need to be addressed, specifically front-back confusion. It is hard to recommendusing crosstalk cancellation with binaural synthesis at the current state for locationcritical signals due to localisation confusion. However, using more than one modality for informationsignals makes the signals difficult to miss and could also help with the front-back confusionproblem, but further research is needed. If a transaural system with crosstalk cancellationis chosen as reproduction format, make sure to carefully select the loudspeaker placementsin order to avoid as many problems with filter generation as possible, since this will cause errorsin crosstalk suppression and affect the reproduction sound quality. Directive loudspeakersmounted in the <b>neck</b> <b>rest,</b> or ceiling, are good candidates for implementation...|$|E

The present study investigated whether Caribbean flamingos display lateral behavioral preferences in foot scratching and two types of stamp-feeding behavior, and examined the relationship, if any, between these lateral behaviors and both pair-bonding and aggression. Four of the birds displayed an individual-level lateral preference on one of the two feeding behaviors. Foot scratching preference was related to age such that older birds tended to utilize the right foot more for scratching. Results also suggested that birds who scratch with the left foot are more likely to be involved in, to be targeted in, and to lose fights, suggesting that lateral foot usage during scratching may be somehow related to social behaviors in this species, but as significant lateral scratching preferences were not found, such results must be viewed with caution. The lateral feeding behaviors did not appear to be significantly related to social cohesion...|$|R
