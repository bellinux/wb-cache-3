25|$|On {{numerous}} {{objects of}} the order dating {{from the very beginning}} of the 20th century, one finds an emblem composed of a square, a compass and a grafting knife. As there is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> of this emblem in the earlier documents, it is probable that it had also been inspired lately by that of Freemasonry.|$|E
25|$|A millpond and {{extensive}} mill buildings formerly occupied the low-lying fields {{on the west}} side of the main Rathfarnham road, just beside the bridge. On a map by Frizell dated 1779 it is called the Widow Clifford's mill and mill holding and in 1843 it is named the Ely Cloth Factory. A Mr. Murray then owned it but in 1850, it passed into the hands of Mr. Nickson who converted it into a flour mill. His family continued in occupation until 1875 when John Lennox took over. In 1880 this mill closed down, the buildings were demolished and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> now remains.|$|E
25|$|<b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> of {{the tower}} or mound of the motte and bailey castle remains now. Henry II {{replaced}} it with a rectangular stone keep, which was built between 1172 and 1177 at a cost of £1,444. A stone bailey, {{in the form of a}} triangle, replaced the previous wooden one. The great outer gateway to the castle, called 'the Black Gate’, was built later, between 1247 and 1250, in the reign of Henry III. There were at that time no town walls and when attacked by the Scots, the townspeople had to crowd into the bailey for safety. It is probable that the new castle acted as a magnet for local merchants because of the safety it provided. This in turn would help to expand trade in the town. At this time wool, skins and lead were being exported, whilst alum, pepper and ginger were being imported from France and Flanders.|$|E

25|$|After 1479–1480 much of Giovanni's {{time and}} energy must also have been taken up by his duties as {{conservator}} of the paintings in the great hall of the Doge's Palace. The importance of this commission can be measured by the payment Giovanni received: he was awarded, first the reversion of a broker's place in the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, and afterwards, as a substitute, a fixed annual pension of eighty ducats. Besides repairing and renewing the works of his predecessors he was commissioned to paint {{a number of new}} subjects, six or seven in all, in further illustration of the part played by Venice in the wars of Frederick Barbarossa and the pope. These works, executed with much interruption and delay, were the object of universal admiration while they lasted, but <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> of them survived the fire of 1577; neither have any other examples of his historical and processional compositions come down, enabling us to compare his manner in such subjects with that of his brother Gentile.|$|E
500|$|Despite this education, biographers Alexander Pantsov and Steven Levine {{commented that}} the [...] "moral-ethical precepts of Confucius seem to have left <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> in his soul". Conversely, biographer Philip Short {{asserted}} that for Mao, as for all Chinese children who went underwent traditional education, these Confucian texts [...] "fixed the underlying pattern of [...] thought {{for the rest of}} his life". Short went so far as to suggest that Confucianism would prove to be [...] "at least as important to [...] as Marxism", noting that even in later life, Mao's speeches contained a greater number of quotations from Confucius and other ancient Chinese philosophers than from major Marxist theoreticians Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "wing-shaped object", the {{fragment}} measures approximately [...] wide and [...] tall. It {{was made in}} one piece, and has [...] "evidence of possible extensions towards {{the base of the}} nasal". Though now {{the fragment}} comprises only the eyebrows and nasal of a helmet, it likely once formed part of a face mask like that on the Gjermundbu helmet, [...] which had [...] "curved linking strips" [...] circling under the wearer’s eyes. The method employed to construct the remainder of the helmet is unknown. [...] "There is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> of chain mail in the find, nor any iron plates fit for making {{up the rest of the}} helmet." [...] Eight fragments of [...] "thin iron strips, about [...] broad and of varying length" [...] were found, however, and may have been originally used to join the helmet plates.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates why A-movement and German {{scrambling}} resist scope {{reconstruction and}} their extraction sites can be unbound without violating the Proper Binding Condition while A'-movement and Japanese scrambling allow scope reconstruction and their extraction sites must obey the Proper Binding Condition. In order {{to account for}} this paradigm, I claim that the former do <b>not</b> leave <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> whereas the latter do so, extending Lasnik's (1999) hypothesis that A-movement does <b>not</b> leave <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> while A'-movement does so.

500|$|Fellow {{songwriter}} Neil Finn (Crowded House) has said, [...] "There {{is something}} unique and powerful {{about the way}} Kelly mixes up everyday detail with the big issues of life, death, love and struggle – <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> of pretence or fakery in there". Ross Clelland, writing for Rolling Stone, described Kelly: [...] "hile he was (rightly) lauded {{for his ability to}} sing of injustice without ranting, or deal with the darker sides of human nature non-judgementally, often overlooked was the fact he could write a damn fine melodic hook to go with those words". Tim Freedman (The Whitlams) acknowledges Kelly, Peter Garrett (Midnight Oil), and John Schumann (Redgum) as inspiring him by [...] " [...] our suburbs with our own myths and social history". However, Kelly has been quoted as saying [...] "Song writing is mysterious to me. I still feel like a total beginner. I don't feel like I have got it nailed yet". In 2007 Kelly donated his 'Lee Oskar' harmonica to the Sydney Powerhouse Museum. The museum's statement of significance cites Kelly's talent as a songwriter, his distinctive voice, and his harmonica playing, particularly on Live, May 1992.|$|E
2500|$|So {{does the}} OWL offset the SCF, or not? [...] It {{is hard to}} say, as no trace {{whatsoever}} has been found of the SCF anywhere south of the OWL.

2500|$|Despite this, {{the details}} of our values and ethics are not inherited: they are partly {{determined}} by our culture, and partly chosen by ourselves. Morality and duty are often at war with natural instincts; ethics cannot be derived from the struggle for existence: [...] "Of moral purpose I see <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> in nature. That is an article of exclusively human manufacture." [...] It is therefore our responsibility to make ethical choices (see Ethics and Evolutionary ethics). This seems to put Huxley as a compatibilist in the Free Will vs Determinism debate. In this argument Huxley is diametrically opposed to his old friend Herbert Spencer.|$|E

2500|$|People {{who knew}} Lokhvitskaya {{personally}} later {{spoke of the}} stark contrast between the poet's 'bacchanal' reputation and her real life persona. The author fond of erotic imagery (whom some critics labeled 'pornographer') in reality was, according to Ivan Bunin, [...] "the most chaste woman in Saint Petersburg, a faithful wife and most caring, protective mother of several children." [...] Playing 'Eastern beauty' at home, she received visitors lying languidly on a couch. Still, according to Bunin, there was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> of pretentiousness behind this posturing; on the contrary, the hostess greatly enjoyed matter-of-fact chattering about funny and trivial things, displaying wit and disarming self-irony.|$|E
2500|$|The plague hit Marrakesh {{again in}} 1799, heavily depopulating the city. [...] Nonetheless, it was {{maintained}} by Suleiman as his primary residence and capital. He completely rebuilt the Ben Youssef Mosque, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> remaining of its old Almoravid and Almohad design. [...] Driven out of Fez, Suleiman was defeated just outside Marrakesh in 1819, in an uprising by the Cherarda (an Arab Bedouin army tribe from the Gharb), although his person was preserved and delivered safely. After Suleiman's death in 1822, his successor Muley Abd al-Rahman reopened trade with foreign nations. Marrakesh hosted numerous foreign embassies seeking out trade treaties {{with the new}} Alawite sultan - e.g. Portugal in 1823, Britain in 1824, France and Sardinia in 1825. [...] Abd al-Rahman is principally responsible for reforesting the gardens outside of Marrakesh.|$|E
2500|$|Merezkovsky, Gippius, Filosofov and Zlobin headed {{first for}} Minsk, then Vilno, staying in both cities to give {{newspaper}} interviews and public lectures. Speaking to a Vilno correspondent, Merezhkovsky commented:The {{whole question of}} Russia's existence as such — and it's non-existent at the moment, as far as I am concerned, — depends on Europe's recognizing at last {{the true nature of}} Bolshevism. Europe has to open its eyes to the fact that Bolshevism uses the Socialist banner only as a camouflage; that what it does in effect is defile high Socialist ideals; that it is a global threat, not just local Russian disease. ...There is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> in Russia at the moment of either Socialism or even the [...] dictatorship of proletariat; the only dictatorship that's there is that of the two people: Lenin and Trotsky.|$|E

2500|$|After {{classes at}} Hollywood High, Stephens rushed to Rogers Airport [...] {{at the corner}} of Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue to look at the biplanes and to talk with the pilots. (Today, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> of the airport remains.) As months passed, the men came to like the lad, and taught him what they knew, even taking him on short hops. Eventually, Jim Webster, airport manager, agreed—with parental permission—to give him flying lessons in {{exchange}} for work around the hangars. In his lessons he was a quick learner, and after logging more cockpit time he finally soloed. This, of course, was an era before the Federal Aviation Administration, with its requisite ground courses and instruction hours. When a pilot first took him aloft, he saw a Los Angeles unrecognizable today. He looked down on a Wilshire Boulevard surrounded by countryside, bordered by [...] "a row of stunted palms." [...] He sometimes flew out of Mines Field, one day to become Los Angeles International Airport.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} to have Ibrahim {{burned at the stake}} was affirmed by the temple priests and the king of Babylon, Nimrod. The news spread like fire in the kingdom and people were coming from all places to watch the execution. A huge pit was dug up and a large quantity of wood was piled up. Then the biggest fire people ever witnessed was lit. The flames were so high up in the sky that even the birds could not fly over it for fear of being burnt themselves. Ibrahim's hands and feet were chained, and he was put in a catapult, ready to be thrown in. During this time, Angel Jibril came to him and said: [...] "O Ibrahim! Is there anything you wish for?" [...] Ibrahim could have asked to be saved from the fire or to be taken away, but Ibrahim replied, [...] "Allah is sufficient for me, He is the best disposer of my affairs." [...] The catapult was released and Ibrahim was thrown into the fire. Allah then gave an order to the fire, [...] "O fire! Be coolness and safety for Ibrahim." [...] A miracle occurred, the fire obeyed and burned only his chains. Ibrahim came out from it as if he was coming out from a garden, peaceful, his face illuminated and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> of smoke on his clothes. People watched in shock and exclaimed: [...] "Amazing! Ibrahim's God has saved him from the fire!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Gunpowder {{bombs were}} used {{again in the}} 1275 Siege of Changzhou in the latter stages of the Mongol-Song Wars. Upon {{arriving}} at the city, Bayan gave the inhabitants an ultimatum: [...] "if you ... resist us ... we shall drain your carcasses of blood and use them for pillows." [...] This didn't work and the city resisted anyway, so the Mongol army bombarded them with fire bombs before storming the walls, after which followed an immense slaughter claiming {{the lives of a}} quarter million. The war lasted for only another four years during which some remnants of the Song held up last desperate defenses. In 1277, 250 defenders under Lou Qianxia conducted a suicide bombing and set off a huge iron bomb when it became clear defeat was imminent. Of this, the History of Song writes, [...] "the noise was like a tremendous thunderclap, shaking the walls and ground, and the smoke filled up the heavens outside. Many of the troops [...] were startled to death. When the fire was extinguished they went in to see. There were just ashes, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> left." [...] So came an end to the Mongol-Song Wars, which saw the deployment of all the gunpowder weapons available to both sides at the time, which for the most part meant gunpowder arrows, bombs, and lances, but in retrospect, another development would overshadow them all, the birth of the gun.|$|E
