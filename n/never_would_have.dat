5|$|Number two, why {{was this}} person, {{this one of the}} six around to commit this hideous crime? He was out because he had a 31-count {{indictment}} for the rape of a child, and he was out on $15,000 bail, instead of the requisite $450,000 bail that he never could have made and <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been on the street.|$|E
5|$|According to Nathan Fillion, {{there was}} an episode in which the crew land on a dying planet. The {{inhabitants}} try to steal Serenity, after they explain to the crew about their need {{to get off the}} planet. The problem is that unless they were to run into another ship along the way, with the extra passengers, Serenity would not have enough fuel and oxygen {{to make it to the}} closest destination. While everyone else is asleep, Mal takes the ship himself and discovers that help <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> arrived.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) has {{everyone}} stay late {{to cover}} for their co-workers in Florida, which turns into an awkward situation when Val's (Ameenah Kaplan) boyfriend, Brandon (Jerry Minor), arrives and accuses Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) of {{having an affair with}} her, after having read Darryl's text messages to her. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) demands that Darryl read them aloud out of voyeuristic interest. Upon hearing them, most of the staff agree that his text messages, particularly an extended ellipsis at the end of one, are suggestive of Darryl wanting to be with Val. Val protests that the idea of her being romantically involved with Darryl is ridiculous. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) suggests that he try a bold step, saying that if Jim had not made romantic advances while she was still engaged to Roy, she <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> ended up marrying him. Darryl follows her advice and tells Val that a potential relationship is not ridiculous.|$|E

25|$|In August 2016, Rogen again {{spoke to}} Howard Stern {{about how he}} had felt hurt and {{somewhat}} betrayed back then by Heigl's comments. He went on {{to talk about what}} a great rapport they'd had on set while working together, and that at the time he had even envisioned making many more movies with her. Though Rogen wishes she would have apologized to him personally as opposed to publicly, he affirmed that he still really liked her, and that he <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> wanted the incident to hurt her career.|$|E

25|$|Bill Cotton, the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment in the mid–1970s, {{said after}} the first series was {{produced}} that the show was {{a prime example of}} the BBC's relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them, but, trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> let the programme get to the production stage {{on the basis of the}} scripts.|$|E
25|$|The second volume, I Am Spock (1995), saw Nimoy {{communicating}} that {{he finally}} realized {{his years of}} portraying the Spock character had led to a much greater identification between the fictional character and himself. Nimoy had much input into how Spock would act in certain situations, and conversely, Nimoy's contemplation of how Spock acted gave him cause to think about things {{in a way that}} he <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> thought if he had not portrayed the character. As such, in this autobiography Nimoy maintains that in some meaningful sense he has merged with Spock {{while at the same time}} maintaining the distance between fact and fiction.|$|E
25|$|After the remarriage, Auchincloss' Merrywood {{estate in}} McLean, Virginia became the Bouvier sisters' primary residence, {{although}} they also spent time at his other estate, Hammersmith Farm in Newport, Rhode Island, {{and in their}} father's homes in New York City and Long Island. Although she retained a relationship with her father, Bouvier also regarded her stepfather as a close paternal figure. He gave her a stable environment and the pampered childhood she <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> experienced otherwise. While Bouvier adjusted to her mother's remarriage, she sometimes felt like an outsider in the WASP social circle of the Auchinclosses, attributing the feeling to her being Catholic {{as well as being}} a child of divorce, which was not common in that social group at that time.|$|E

25|$|Matthew Cowley {{dedicated}} a meetinghouse and a {{new mission}} home in Papeete just four years later on January 22, 1950. Later that same year, the church purchased a two-masted schooner {{that was used to}} aid in transporting missionaries and members from the various islands in French Polynesia. The boat was called Paraita which was the Tahitian name for Addison Pratt. The schooner was scheduled to take a group of members to Hawaii to visit the temple. President McKay instructed the members to cancel the trip in 1959. The boat sank a few days later and <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> made the trip. In 1963, the church experienced a tragedy when a boat that was transporting members back to Maupiti crashed. 15 church members were killed.|$|E
25|$|Aurelian's short reign reunited a {{fragmented}} Empire while saving Rome from barbarian invasions that had reached Italy itself. His death prevented a full restoration of political stability and a lasting dynasty that could end {{the cycle of}} assassination of emperors and civil war that marked this period. Even so, he brought the Empire through a very critical period in its history, and without Aurelian it <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> survived the invasions and fragmentation of the decade in which he reigned. Much hard fighting remained for his successors before the Empire finally regained the initiative against the Persians and the northern barbarian peoples, {{and it would be}} another twenty years or more before Diocletian fully restored stability and ended the Crisis of the third century. However, after that the Western half of the Empire would survive another two hundred years, while the East would last another millennium, and for that Aurelian must be allowed much of the credit.|$|E
25|$|Zach {{comes into}} the {{knowledge}} that Kendall agreed to act as the surrogate for Ryan and Greenlee's baby when Greenlee's chances of giving birth became non-existent. He utterly hates the idea, and is determined to ensure Kendall will not go through with it. Once Ryan reveals himself to be alive a little after this, Kendall comes to the shocking realization that her husband helped Ryan fake his death. She is enraged at Zach, and states that she <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> taken {{on the task of}} being Greenlee's surrogate if she had known that Ryan is alive. Zach and Kendall fight on and off, but no matter their argumentative nature, Zach has developed true romantic feelings for Kendall. At this point, Greenlee has discovered that Kendall is pregnant not with Greenlee and Ryan's baby, but rather with Kendall and Ryan's baby. She spills this knowledge to the whole town, stating that Kendall has betrayed her in order to produce a child between Ryan and herself. Kendall is embarrassed and heartbroken at Greenlee's accusation, and tries to explain that Greenlee's eggs had been destroyed at implantation time, and if she had not used her own eggs, Greenlee would have been without Ryan's child for certain. Greenlee does not care to listen and soon leaves town. Zach sticks by Kendall's side and tells her of his love for her. Kendall is afraid of his declaration, and starts to distance herself from him. She asks for a divorce, not admitting that she feels the same way. Zach agrees to grant her a divorce, but Bianca Montgomery, Kendall's sister, counsels Zach to not give up on Kendall. Zach does as suggested, and informs Kendall of his love for her again. This time Kendall does not hold back and the two share a passionate kiss.|$|E

She said [...] "I'm thrilled to be collaborating with Square Enix on such a groundbreaking game.

500|$|After {{his third}} retirement, Jordan {{assumed that he}} would be able to return to his front office {{position}} as Director of Basketball Operations with the Wizards. However, his previous tenure in the Wizards' front office had produced the aforementioned mixed results and may have also influenced the trade of Richard [...] "Rip" [...] Hamilton for Jerry Stackhouse (although Jordan was not technically Director of Basketball Operations in 2002). On May 7, 2003, Wizards owner Abe Pollin fired Jordan as Washington's President of Basketball Operations. Jordan later stated that he felt betrayed, and that if he knew he would be fired upon retiring he <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> come back to play for the Wizards.|$|E
500|$|Tempos {{slowed to}} an oft dirge-like pace on Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978); Rehearsals and {{recording}} of the album stretched out over a long period, with Springsteen and bandmate and co-producer Steven Van Zandt experiencing a prolonged frustration over their inability to capture a more resonant drum sound. Weinberg soon regretted not playing faster on [...] "Badlands", and tempos did speed up on that number and some others during the accompanying Darkness Tour. [...] He did later say that [...] "It was a ballsy thing to play a single stroll roll through the entirety of 'Candy's Room'" [...] {{and that it was}} the kind of choice a session musician <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> tried.|$|E
