I. PROBLEM STATEMENT We first recall some notations from [1], [2]. For the unoccluded 2 -D setup, each camera, either actual or virtual, is a monotonic mapping from the same interval [a, b] to R. For <b>N</b> <b>actual</b> cameras {Hi} N i= 1 and the actual camera Hv, let Yi = {yi,n} be the set of points on the virtual image plane propagated from {xi,n}–the pixels associated with actual camera Hi, for i = 1, 2, [...] ., N. We are interested in an approximation of Qk Y –the k-power sum of sample intervals of the ordered set Y = ∪ N i= 1 Yi = {ym} NY m= 1 defined as follows: Q k Y = NY − 1 m= 1 (ym+ 1 − ym) k.

The error distributions of properly simulated replicate data sets mimic those of actual replicate measurements and can be used to estimate the std. dev. for an assay along with other statistical quantities. We have used this technique to estimate the standard deviation in radionuclide masses determined using the tomographic gamma scanner (TGS) and combined thermal/epithermal neutron (CTEN) methods. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by a comparison of our Monte Carlo error estimates with the error distributions in actual replicate measurements and simulations of measurements. We found that the std. dev. estimated this way quickly converges to an accurate value on average and has a predictable error distribution similar to <b>N</b> <b>actual</b> repeat measurements.

40|$|Oblivious {{transfer}} {{is one of}} the most basic and important building blocks in cryptography. As such, understanding its cost is of prime importance. Beaver (STOC 1996) showed that it is possible to obtain poly(n) oblivious transfers given only <b>n</b> <b>actual</b> oblivious transfer calls and using one-way functions, where n is the security parameter. In addition, he showed that it is impossible to extend oblivious transfer information theoretically. The notion of extending oblivious {{transfer is}} important theoretically (to understand the complexity of computing this primitive) and practically (since oblivious transfers can be expensive and thus extending them using only one-way functions is very attractive). Despite its importance, very little is known about the feasibility of extending oblivious transfer, beyond the fact that it is impossible information theoretically. Specifically, it is not known whether or not one-way functions are actually necessary for extending oblivious transfer, whether or not it is possible to extend oblivious transfers with adaptive security, and whether or not it is possible to extend oblivious transfers when starting with just a few. In this paper, we address these questions and provide almost complete answers to all of them. We show that the existence of any oblivious transfer extension protocol with security for static semihonest adversaries implies one-way functions, that an oblivious transfer extension protocol with adaptive security implies oblivious transfer with static security, and that the existence of an oblivious transfer extension protocol from only O(log n) oblivious transfers implies oblivious transfer itself...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a summary {{model for the}} dynamics of carbon and nitrogen under varying weather, crop and soil conditions to investigate the role of soil organic carbon and nitrogen in yield formation in rice-based cropping systems of the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP). The model consists of three modules: soil organic matter (SOM), soil (SOIL), and crop growth (CROP). The SOM module consists of three pools: fresh, labile and stable. Carbon and nitrogen dynamics in the model are {{described in terms of}} carbon turnover, assimilation and dissimilation, with nitrogen linked through distinct C/N ratios. The SOIL module has two soil layers of variable depth (often 15 cm each), and the labile and stable pools are replicated for these two layers. Water, crop and soil management practices and aeration characteristics of these layers affect the C and N dynamics of their respective pools. The CROP module calculates potential and actual biomass, leaf area index (LAI), evapotranspiration, total <b>N</b> demand, <b>actual</b> <b>N</b> uptake and <b>N</b> stress. <b>Actual</b> biomass is first partitioned between above (leaves, stem and storage organs) and below ground (roots and rhizodeposition), and a harvest index (HI) is applied to the aboveground biomass to calculate the yield. Independent data sets of 9 long-term experiments (LTEs) from the IGP of India were used for calibration and validation of the model. After calibration and validation, the model was used to explore the impact of various crop and soil management practices in rice-based cropping systems on different sites of the IGP. Overall, the model satisfactorily reproduced observed crop yields, SOC dynamics and total soil N dynamics for various cropping systems at different sites. Nitrogen mineralized from soil organic nitrogen contributed 5 – 75 % to total N uptake in fertilized and non-fertilized treatments. With a recommended NPK application, a trend of significant decrease in simulated rice yield was found only at Ludhiana- 3, and Pantnagar. Similarly, the simulated wheat yield also showed a significant trend of decline at Ludhina- 3, Pantnagar and Barrackpore. Simulated SOC had a significant decline at Pantnagar, whereas at Ludhiana- 3, it showed a significant increase. An increase in SOM is not always associated with an increase in yield, as the factor(s) improved by an increase in SOM may not be the limiting factor for crop growth. Depletion of many major macro (NPK) and micro (Zn, Fe, Mn, etc.) nutrients, essential for plant growth even with a balanced NPK fertilizer application and a maintained SOC, can lead to a decline in productivity.

40|$|Animals {{frequently}} {{make use}} of highly reflecting surfaces, as for example in the tapeta of {{the eyes of many}} vertebrates, the iridophores and photophores of many marine animals, and the scales of fish. Such surfaces raise the question: how are high reflectivities, often comparable with that of polished metal, achieved using biological materials? Highly reflecting surfaces in which metals are not employed have recently been developed industrially. The principle employed is that of the quarter-wavelength film (Text-fig. 1), in which light reflected from the front surface of a transparent thin film is in phase with, and so interferes constructively with, light reflected from the back surface. Light reflected at a low to high refractive index interface (in this case the upper surface of the film) undergoes a phase change of £ wavelength. So, for construc-tive interference, light reflected from the lower interface must be retarded by wave-length. The optical thickness of the fihn (refractive index, <b>n,</b> x <b>actual</b> thickness, t) must therefore be J wavelength for maximum constructive interference to occur when light is reflected normally...|$|R

The experimental results show that when IgG concentration is high enough, the translocation probability will not always increase with increasing IgG concentration. This is just like the following case: imagine a stadium with limited doors, the maximum allowed flux of people in unit time is N.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} mapping the nitrogen (N) status in a maize field using hyperspectral remote sensing imagery. An airborne survey was conducted with an AISA Eagle hyperspectral sensor over an experimental farm where maize (Zea mays L.) was grown with two N fertilization levels (0 and 100 kg N ha- 1) in four replicates. Leaf and canopy field data were collected during the flight. The nitrogen (N) status has been estimated in this work based on the Nitrogen Nutrition Index (NNI) defined as the ratio between the leaf <b>actual</b> <b>N</b> concentration (%Na) of the crop and the minimum N content required for the maximum biomass production (critical N concentration (%Nc)) calculated through the dry mass {{at the time of}} the flight (Wflight). The inputs required to calculate the NNI (i. e. %Na and Wflight) have been estimated through regression analyses between field data and remotely sensed vegetation indices. MCARI/MTVI 2 (Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index / Modified Triangular Vegetation Index 2) showed the best performances in estimating the %Na (R 2 = 0. 59) and MTVI 2 in estimating the Wflight (R 2 = 0. 80). The %Na and the Wflight were then mapped and used to compute the NNI map over the entire field. The NNI map agreed with the NNI estimated using field data through traditional destructive measurements (R 2 = 0. 70) confirming the potential of using remotely sensed indices to assess the crop N condition.
