5|$|For {{public access}} the RNLI classifies {{stations}} {{as one of}} three types: Explore, which are <b>normally</b> open all year round and have a shop, Discover, <b>normally</b> open {{during the summer months}} and Observe which, because of their location, still welcome visitors but may not be easily accessible.|$|E
5|$|The Brigade is modular in nature, {{allowing}} it to take on additional units when deployed. <b>Normally</b> the Brigade only deploys with its Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC); organic battalions and companies <b>normally</b> don't deploy with the HHC.|$|E
5|$|A 2013 {{study found}} that p-Coumaric acid, which is <b>normally</b> present in honey, assists bees in detoxifying certain pesticides. Its absence in {{artificial}} nutrients fed to bees may therefore contribute to CCD.|$|E
5|$|A further type of {{committee}} is <b>normally</b> {{set up to}} scrutinise private bills submitted to the Scottish Parliament by an outside party or promoter {{who is not a}} member of the Scottish Parliament or Scottish Government. Private bills <b>normally</b> relate to large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property. Private Bill Committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the Edinburgh Tram Network, the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link and extensions to the National Gallery of Scotland.|$|E

5|$|At other times, Krichell {{collected}} some of {{the best}} prospects in an area, <b>normally</b> 300 or more, and put them through a four-day workout.

The few players who survived the workout were assigned by Krichell to the Yankees Minor League hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth oxide, in its delta form, {{is a solid}} {{electrolyte}} for oxygen. This form <b>normally</b> breaks down below a high-temperature threshold, but can be electrodeposited well below this temperature in a highly alkaline solution.|$|E
5|$|Blake v Barnard {{established}} {{a rule that}} conditional threats could not amount to an assault. However, the court's reliance on Tuberville v Savage was tenuous at best. Such threats would <b>normally</b> be considered assault.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{takes place}} during {{different}} times of year in different areas. In Colombia, breeding <b>normally</b> happens in February until July. In Ecuador, the breeding interval spans from July until February.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles are <b>normally</b> {{produced}} in the vascular bed and transported by the venous system to heart, then to the lungs.|$|E
5|$|Concorde was <b>normally</b> {{perceived}} as a privilege of the rich, but special circular or one-way (with return by other flight or ship) charter flights were arranged to bring a trip within the means of moderately well-off enthusiasts.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, populations {{can expand}} rapidly {{after a series}} of mild winters. In lowland Britain, there was an {{increase}} of 48% following the 1970/71 winter, with many pairs spreading into deciduous woodlands where they would not <b>normally</b> breed.|$|E
5|$|Demographic {{research}} services <b>normally</b> do not differentiate between {{various types of}} non-religious respondents, so agnostics are often classified {{in the same category}} as atheists or other non-religious people.|$|E
5|$|Dùn in St Kilda is {{separated}} from Hirta by a shallow strait about 50 metres wide. This is <b>normally</b> impassable but is reputed to dry out on rare occasions.|$|E

5|$|Rowan Atkinson has {{appeared}} in character as Bean in many <b>normally</b> factual television broadcasts, sometimes as a publicity stunt to promote a new episode, DVD or film.|$|E
5|$|Tense {{systems in}} Mayan {{languages}} are generally simple. Jakaltek, for example, contrasts only past and non-past, while Mam has only future and non-future. Aspect systems are <b>normally</b> more prominent. Mood does not <b>normally</b> form a separate system in Mayan, but is instead {{intertwined with the}} tense/aspect system. Kaufman has reconstructed a tense/aspect/mood system for proto-Mayan that includes seven aspects: incompletive, progressive, completive/punctual, imperative, potential/future, optative, and perfective.|$|E

5|$|The {{airfield}} {{opened in}} 2005 {{and serves as}} {{the centre of the}} Dronning Maud Land Air Network (DROMLAN), a multinational cooperation to use Troll as an all-year hub to provide intercontinental traffic to Antarctica and onwards to the various research stations using aircraft suitable for inter-Antarctic operations. Intercontinental flights <b>normally</b> operate from Cape Town International Airport using Ilyushin 76, C-130 Hercules, P-3 Orion and similar, long-range aircraft. Feeding services to other research station is <b>normally</b> done either with Basler BT-67 aircraft, De Havilland DHC-6/300 Twin Otter aircraft and Dornier Do-228 aircraft and helicopters.|$|E
5|$|The biliary tree is <b>normally</b> {{relatively}} free of bacteria because of certain protective mechanisms. The sphincter of Oddi {{acts as a}} mechanical barrier. The biliary system <b>normally</b> has low pressure (8 to 12 cmH2O) and allows bile to flow freely through. The continuous forward flow of the bile in the duct flushes bacteria, if present, into the duodenum, and does not allow {{the establishment of an}} infection. The constitution of bilebile salts and immunoglobulin secreted by the epithelium of the bile duct also has a protective role.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecliptic}} is not <b>normally</b> noticeable from Earth's surface because Earth rotates, {{carrying the}} observer through {{the cycles of}} sunrise and sunset, which obscure the Sun's apparent motion {{against the background of}} fixed stars.|$|E

Occasionally, the hat was adorned with insignia of the wearer's preference, {{and may have been}} pinned up for the drill {{in the use of the}} regular weapon of the time, the Rifled-musket.|$|E
5|$|This tit-tyrant defends its {{territory}} only against other tit-tyrants and, {{except for the}} southernmost population, is non-migratory. The tufted tit-tyrant feeds mainly {{on a variety of}} insects that it hunts on or from small shrubs, typically by perch gleaning. It <b>normally</b> hunts in pairs. The breeding season varies for this bird depending on its geographical location. Two to three eggs are <b>normally</b> laid twice a year in a cup-shaped nest made of root fibers, grasses, and lichens and lined with small feathers. The tufted tit-tyrant is listed as a species of least concern due to its large range and population.|$|E
