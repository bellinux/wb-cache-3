In December 2005 MK Dons set a target of playing at the <b>new</b> <b>ground</b> by January 2007; in February 2007 they revised their proposal to a 22,000-seater stadium ready in July of that year, with provision for expansion to 32,000 (it had originally been intended to seat 30,000). The <b>new</b> <b>ground,</b> named Stadium mk, hosted its first match in July 2007.|$|E
5|$|Luton Town {{moved to}} Kenilworth Road in 1905, leaving their {{previous}} home at Dunstable Road after their landlord sold {{the site for}} housing at short notice. The club's directors quickly procured a new site, and the club's first match at the <b>new</b> <b>ground</b> came on 4 September 1905—a 0–0 draw against Plymouth Argyle. Watford player C. Barnes scored the first ever goal at the stadium, in a reserve match. Originally known as Ivy Road, the <b>new</b> <b>ground</b> brought success with it—in their last season at Dunstable Road, Luton had finished second from bottom, but in the first at Kenilworth Road, Luton finished fourth in the Southern League.|$|E

5|$|Renovation of Kenilworth Road was {{neglected}} for {{the next}} two decades—financial difficulties and the club's ambitions to build a <b>new</b> <b>ground</b> meant that regeneration was unaffordable, and would also prove unnecessary should relocation occur. However, following the rejection of several potential sites for a <b>new</b> <b>ground,</b> the club finally turned their attentions back to the maintenance of Kenilworth Road. The first real modernisation of the ground came in 1973, with the first addition of seats at the stadium since the construction of the new Main Stand in 1922. The Bobbers Stand became all-seated, {{while the rest of the}} ground remained terracing. The new-look stand could only hold 1,539 seats, and as a result the capacity of the ground dropped to 22,601.|$|E
5|$|The 1997–98 season saw Stoke move to its <b>new</b> <b>ground,</b> the 28,000 all-seater Britannia Stadium, after 119 {{years at}} the Victoria Ground, the longest time spent at a ground by any team in Britain. Chic Bates, Macari's assistant, was {{appointed}} manager for the club's inaugural season in the <b>new</b> <b>ground.</b> Bates struggled as his side slipped from a play-off place towards the relegation zone, with the club's bad run culminating in a 7–0 home defeat to Birmingham City. Bates was replaced by Chris Kamara in January 1998. Kamara could not improve the club's fortunes, and he left in April. Alan Durban, Stoke's manager two decades earlier, took charge {{for the remainder of}} season. Durban was unable to keep the club up, with a 23rd-place finish consigning Stoke to relegation from Division One.|$|E
5|$|By 1912, the Cardiff Football Ground, as it {{was then}} known, had a new south stand and {{temporary}} stands on the north, east and west ends of the ground. The south stand was covered, while the north terrace was initially without a roof. The improvements were partly funded by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU). The opening ceremony took place on 5 October 1912, with a match between Newport RFC and Cardiff RFC. The <b>new</b> <b>ground</b> was opened by Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart. This new development increased the ground capacity to 43,000 and much improved the facilities at the ground compared to the earlier stands.|$|E

The National Stadium, as it was known, was officially opened in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{disagree}} on Tristano's importance in jazz history. Max Harrison {{indicated that the}} pianist had limited influence outside his own group of affiliated musicians; Robert Palmer, who pointed out that only one of Tristano's albums was in print {{at the time of}} his death, suggested that he was pivotal in the change from 1940s modern jazz to the freer styles of subsequent decades; and Thomas Albright similarly believed that his improvising prepared and developed <b>new</b> <b>ground</b> in the history of the music.|$|E
5|$|Director Harry Morris {{identified}} {{a site for}} a <b>new</b> <b>ground</b> in Bordesley Green, some three-quarters of a mile(1km) from Muntz Street towards the city centre. The site was where a brickworks once operated; the land sloped steeply down to stagnant pools, yet the stadium was constructed in under twelve months from land clearance to opening ceremony on Boxing Day 1906. Heavy snow nearly prevented the opening; volunteers had to clear pitch and terraces before the match, a goalless draw against Middlesbrough, could go ahead. The ground is reputed to have been cursed by gypsies evicted from the site; although gypsies {{are known to have}} camped nearby, there is no contemporary evidence for their eviction by the club.|$|E

They were founding members of the Southern Football League which they won {{for the first two}} years of its existence, and were runners-up in its third. They were forced to move to a <b>new</b> <b>ground</b> North Greenwich in 1901, as the Millwall Dock Company wanted to use their land as a timberyard. Millwall Athletic reached the FA Cup semi-finals in 1900 and 1903, and were also champions of the Western Football League in 1908 and 1909.|$|E
5|$|In August 2006, Juventus {{returned}} {{to play in}} the Stadio Comunale, then known as Stadio Olimpico, after the restructuring of the stadium for the 2006 Winter Olympics onward.

Unlike the old ground, there is not a running track and instead the pitch is only 7.5 metres away from the stands. The capacity is 41,507. Work began during spring 2009 and the stadium was opened on 8 September 2011, ahead of the start of the 2011–12 season.|$|E

Upon turning professional the club moved to Mill Lane.

5|$|Manningham Rugby Football Club, {{formed in}} 1876, {{originally}} played games at Cardigan Fields, in the Carlisle Road area of Bradford. When their ground {{was sold to}} facilitate the construction of Drummond School, the club required a new home. Consequently, they bought one-third of the Valley Parade site in Manningham, taking a short-term lease out {{on the rest of}} the land in time to play there for the 1886–87 season. The <b>new</b> <b>ground</b> and the road it was built upon both adopted the name of the local area, Valley Parade, a name deriving from the steep hillside below Manningham. The land was previously a quarry, and formed part of a greater site owned by Midland Railway Company.|$|E

The estimated cost of The Den was £10,000.
