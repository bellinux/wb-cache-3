5|$|Kalata and Snelgrove {{thought that}} Puzzle de Call {{featured}} interesting ideas, {{but that there}} was <b>not</b> <b>anything</b> special about it. They enjoyed how Messiah Riser was different from other Japanese role-playing games, but found the user interface hard to use and that the artificial intelligence felt erratic; they also commented on how demons only have one magic attack each made the game feel limiting.

5|$|According to Ehrman, Jesus {{taught that}} a coming kingdom was everyone's proper focus, <b>not</b> <b>anything</b> in this life. He taught about the Jewish Law, seeking its true meaning, {{sometimes}} {{in opposition to}} other traditions. Jesus put love {{at the center of}} the Law, and following that Law was an apocalyptic necessity. His ethical teachings called for forgiveness, not judging others, loving enemies, and caring for the poor. Funk and Hoover note that typical of Jesus were paradoxical or surprising turns of phrase, such as advising one, when struck on the cheek, to offer the other cheek to be struck as well (Luke 6:29).|$|E

Brody said he did not do his own vocals, adding, [...] "My singing voice is still going through puberty.

MetalEater's Sean Bester decided Kalmah's strength lay in their consistency: [...] "releasing energetic and melodic music with consistent intervals of time between them, delivering tracks that are consistently likable, and each one is consistent with the sound they've firmly established for themselves." [...] NecroWeb gave the album a perfect score, because it was [...] "beautifully arranged", [...] "wonderfully varied", did not contain any filler material, and it succeeded at combining melodic thrash with blackened death metal (a combination of black metal and death metal).|$|E

The couple has three children and maintains two homes in Kifisia, along with an office in Athens and a holiday home in Preveza, all courtesy of a large estate belonging to Tsakalotos' father. Through his father, Euclid Tsakalotos is the first cousin twice-removed (great-grandnephew) of Thrasyvoulos Tsakalotos, who served as Chief of the Hellenic Army General Staff from 1951 to 1952.

500|$|For three years, from 1787 to 1790, Dissenters {{had been}} {{attempting}} to convince Parliament {{to repeal the}} Test and Corporation Acts which limited {{the civil rights of}} Dissenters. After the repeal was voted down for the third time, Barbauld burst onto the public stage after [...] "nine years of silence." [...] Her highly charged pamphlet is written in a biting and sarcastic tone; it opens, [...] "we thank you for the compliment paid the Dissenters, when you suppose that the moment they are eligible to places of power and profit, all such places will at once be filled with them." [...] She argues that Dissenters deserve the same rights as any other men: [...] "We claim it as men, we claim it as citizens, we claim it as good subjects." [...] Moreover, she contends that it is precisely the isolation forced on Dissenters by others that marks them out, <b>not</b> <b>anything</b> inherent in their form of worship. Finally, appealing to British patriotism, she maintains that the French cannot be allowed to outstrip the English in liberty.|$|E
500|$|Hoppus {{considered}} {{the music on}} the album wide-ranging, commenting, [...] "We tried to capture the energy and not worry so much about all the knobs." [...] This includes songs he felt sounded like the group circa 1999, [...] "super-fast late-Nineties-punk-rock-sounding songs," [...] {{as well as more}} progressive songs [...] "that are like nothing we have ever done before." [...] Overall, he {{considered the}} record [...] "really rich with sing-along melodies and sing-along choruses," [...] which was what he preferred most when listening to bands. Feldmann considered the music not a [...] "huge departure" [...] from the band's usual sound, as hoped to make a [...] "classic Blink record." [...] To familiarize himself, he listened to all of the band's catalogue prior to recording. Lisa Worden, music director at Los Angeles radio station KROQ, compared its sound to the second Blink-182 album, Dude Ranch, and commented, [...] "It sounds like Blink but it's <b>not</b> <b>anything</b> that we've heard before. For fans of the band, they're going to be super happy with it." ...|$|E

It’s <b>not</b> <b>anything</b> too over the top; it’s just right where it needs to be." [...] During a chat with fans on Ustream.tv on September 27, 2010, Brown said that {{the song was}} written in 15minutes; [...] "We actually got the beat and we did it in no time. It was effortless. It was fun. It was sort of like when we wrote 'Forever', so I hope you guys like that record. It's more of a pop record, in the club record." ...|$|E

500|$|Shane Phoenix of Hot Spots gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} song, stating that [...] "the girls are going to love the lyrics. It brings total sex appeal and groove that starts the hips swinging and is so meant to break the set into a dark drive and into sensual exploration of a grind close contact dance rhythm". Rich Lopez of the Dallas Voice cited the song as {{being one of the}} [...] "better" [...] songs of Love? and was surprised it had [...] "yet to be released as a single". Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly complimented the potential of the song by stating that it is [...] "sure to fit right into club DJ mixes and get people dancing"; however, he criticized that Gaga was [...] "all over the song ... as if Lopez went into the booth trying to emulate her delivery." [...] Emily Exton of Popdust agreed, adding that [...] "you'd be silly not to think" [...] that the song's chorus will become a dance-floor chant among [...] "slightly intoxicated females (and males) in bars across America this summer". She additionally wrote that it was [...] "impossible to get [...] out of your head after more than one listen" [...] although becoming [...] "increasingly monotonous over nearly three and half minutes" [...] Digital Spy's Robert Copsey roughly expanded on this view, stating that [...] "Hypnotico" [...] is <b>not</b> <b>anything</b> [...] "we haven't heard before," [...] although elaborating that it is worthy of a standalone release.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Carey {{signed a}} new record deal with Island Records and in 2005 she {{released}} her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi. It became the best-selling album of 2005 the United States, and the second best-seller around the world, with over 12 million units sold. It earned a myriad of music industry awards, and brought Carey {{back to the top}} of pop music following her commercial decline in 2001. After completing The Adventures of Mimi Tour, she began working on material for her eleventh studio effort, the yet untitled E=MC². E=MC² was hailed {{as one of the most}} anticipated albums of 2008, with many critics weighing their opinions on whether Carey would be able to deliver significant success, following her achievements with The Emancipation of Mimi. Carey began writing and producing the music she saw fit, and <b>not</b> <b>anything</b> to please record executives. Throughout 2007, Carey recorded the album in a studio built into her private villa in Anguilla, in the Caribbean. She describe E=MC² as one of her most expressive albums, and one that she felt free on, and able to express herself through her music. In an interview with The Bryan Times, Carey spoke of her sentiments on the album [...] "It's hard for me to sit here and talk about it without sounding like if I'm bragging if I'm in love with it, but I am I love with this album. I think that having the success with the last record allowed me to have more [...] freedom...and just make records that I like. Its kind of a really fun record.|$|E
500|$|Many {{have given}} {{suggestions}} as Jason's motivation for killing. Ken Kirzinger refers to Jason as a [...] "psychotic mama's boy gone horribly awry...very resilient. You can't kill him, but he feels pain, just not like everyone else." [...] Kirzinger {{goes on to}} say that Jason is a [...] "psycho-savant", and believes his actions are based on pleasing his mother, and <b>not</b> <b>anything</b> personal. Andrew O'Hehir has stated, [...] "Coursing hormones act, of course, as smelling salts to prudish Jason, that ever-vigilant enforcer of William Bennett-style values." [...] Todd Farmer, writer for Jason X, wrote the scene where Jason wakes from cryonic hibernation just as two of the teenagers are having sex. Farmer liked the idea that sex acts triggered Jason back to life. Whatever his motivations, Kane Hodder believes there is a limit to what he will do. According to Hodder, Jason might violently murder any person he comes across, but when Jason Takes Manhattan called for Hodder to kick the lead character's dog, Hodder refused, stating that, while Jason has no qualms against killing humans, he is not bad enough to hurt animals. Another example from Jason Takes Manhattan, involves Jason being confronted by a street gang of young teenage boys one of whom threatens him with a knife, however Jason chooses not to kill them and instead scares them off by lifting up his mask and showing them his face. Likewise, director Tom McLoughlin chose not to have Jason harm any of the children he encounters in Jason Lives, stating that Jason would not kill a child, out of a sympathy for the plight of children generated by his own death as a child.|$|E
