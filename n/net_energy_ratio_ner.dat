However the viability of these sources is critically dependent on environmental, economic and technological considerations. This paper focuses on the environmental aspect of future photovoltaic (PV) systems which are assessed through life cycle analysis (LCA). Previous LCA studies on commercially available PV systems are reviewed. The sustainable evaluation methods used in these studies are also discussed. These methods are applied to the hybrid quantum dot (QD) -based solar cells currently under development within a project between the University of Manchester and Imperial College London. The aim of this project is to develop affordable solar cells with efficiencies up to 10 % for micro-generation applications. Presently hybrid QD-based solar cells are not commercially fabricated; therefore the study is mostly based on very small laboratory-scale production. For easy comparability 10 % conversion efficiency and 25 years lifetime are initially assumed. Lower conversion efficiencies and shorter lifetimes likely to initially characterise emerging PV technologies such as the hybrid QD-based solar cells are discussed. Comparable criteria for sustainability of electricity-generating systems namely <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> (<b>NER),</b> energy pay-back time (EPB-T) and CO 2 emissions per unit generated during lifetime {{are found to be}} lower than current commercially available PV modules.

In order {{to better understand the}} drivers {{of the energy}} productivity of oil production, we use a novel approach that applies a detailed field-level engineering model of oil and gas production to estimate energy requirements of drilling, producing, processing, and transporting crude oil. We examine 40 global oilfields, utilizing detailed data for each field from hundreds of technical and scientific data sources.

We have evaluated the lipid yield and energy use of a process for production of biodiesel from agricultural waste using lipid-accumulating yeast and fungi. We included different bioreactors for submerged and solid-state fermentation in our evaluation. Using existing kinetic models, we predict lipid yields on substrate between 5 % and 19 % (w/w), depending on the culture system. According to the same models, improvement of the yield to 25 – 30 % (w/w) is possible, for example by genetic modifi cation of the micro-organisms. The <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> of the non-optimized systems varies between 0. 8 and 2. 5 MJ produced per MJ used; energy use for pre-treatment and for oxygen transfer are most important. For the optimized systems, the <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> increases to 2. 9 – 5. 5 MJ produced per MJ used, which can compete very well with other biofuels such as bioethanol or algal biodiesel.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to assess the energy and {{environmental}} benefits of cultivating hybrid poplars as a biomass crop for cellulosic ethanol. A "Life Cycle Assessment" (LCA) methodology is used to systematically evaluate the hybrid poplar's energy input and output as well as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The system boundary is divided into three sections, agriculture, transportation, and ethanol processing. In this LCA, only energy from fossil fuels is accounted for, and only energy yield from ethanol yield is considered. Energy demands and associated emissions for all operations are divided equally over the total biomass harvested over a 10 year timeline. Ultimately, the <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>ratio,</b> the amount of clean energy produced over the amount of fossil fuels consumed, and the amount of carbon dioxide emitted during the cultivation process is compared to those of current forms of fuel and other renewable resources. The <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> was calculated to be in the range of 5. 82 to 8. 55, which was found to be higher than both gasoline and corn ethanol. (cont.) The carbon dioxide emission was calculated to be in the range of 2. 42 to 3. 55 grams CO 2 per MJ output, and was lower than the net emissions of both gasoline and corn ethanol. However, in comparing to other renewable resources, such as solar and wind, hybrid poplars were evaluated to be less optimal in energy efficiency and GHG emissions. by Jessica J. Huang. Thesis (S.

The <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> for the photobioreactor reactor {{proved to be}} a negative value considering energy requirements in its construction and material production. <b>Net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> depends on many factors such as the cultivation, harvesting, production and processing methods and can vary from each process [201]. For instance, the US DOE reported in the algal biodiesel production roadmap as follows: The energy content of most algae cells is of the order of 5 watt-hours/gram if the energy content of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins and the typical percentage of each in algae are considered [202]. It is possible to estimate the energy requirements in watt-hours/gram of algae for harvesting, de-watering, and drying {{as a function of the}} volume percentage of algae in harvested biomass. The energy requirements for flocculation and sedimentation and the belt filter press are expected to be minimal. However, based on the latent heat of vaporization of water at 0.54 watt-hours/gram, energy balance can become an issue in systems that propose to take algal biomass and concentrate / dry it to enable downstream processing and extraction because of the high volumes of water that must be evaporated away. In spite of gaps in data precluding more detailed analyses, algal biofuel production schemes at scale will likely need to implement innovative technologies and integrated systems in order to overcome this challenge.

Negative <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> value found for MoE is a consequence of not utilizing system co-products (e. g. stillage and cane trash) for energy. Taking into account only fossil fuel or petroleum inputs in the production cycle, the energy analysis provides results in favour of ethanol. A positive <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> of 5. 95 Â MJ/L which corresponds to 39 % energy gain shows that MoE is efficient as far as its potential to replace fossil fuels is concerned. Another encouraging result is that each MJ of petroleum inputs can produce 6. 12 Â MJ of ethanol fuel. Regarding supply potential, if only the surplus molasses is utilized for ethanol, a shift of 8 - 10 % sugar cane produce to fuel ethanol from its current use in sugar industry could be a probable solution.

40|$|Biodiesel from {{palm oil}} has been {{considered}} for partial substitution of diesel fuel for transportation in Thailand. The Government of Thailand recently {{has set up a}} production target of 8. 5 Â million liters per day of palm oil-based biodiesel by 2011. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the energy consumption of palm methyl ester (PME) production in Thailand using a life cycle approach compared to other possible oil crops for biodiesel production including jatropha and coconut. The main contributors to the energy use are cultivation, oil production, transesterification and transportation. Taking into account only fossil fuel or petroleum inputs in the production cycle, the energy analysis provides results in favour of PME in Thailand. The net energy balance (NEB) and <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> (<b>NER)</b> of PME and co-products are 100. 84 Â GJ/ha and 3. 58, respectively. The NER of PME without co-products is 2. 42, which is still higher than one indicating a favourable result. The results are important in selecting an appropriate feedstock for biodiesel production and this study will support policy makers in the energy sector to make informed decisions vis-à-vis promotion of oil palm plantation for biodiesel. This will also support the Government of Thailand in its policy to promote the use of indigenous and renewable sources for transportation fuels.

40|$|Uncertainty in {{the global}} energy market and {{negative}} environmental impacts associated with fossil fuels has led to renewed interest in alternative fuels. The scalability of new technologies and production pathways are critically being evaluated through economic feasibility studies and environmental impact assessments. This work investigated the conversion of agricultural wast, delactosed whey permeate (delac), with yeast fermentation for the generation of biofuel via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The feasibility of the process was demonstrated at laboratory scale with data leveraged to validate systems models used to perform industrial-scale economic and environmental impact analyses. Results showed a minimum fuel selling point of $ 4. 56 per gasoline gallon equivalent (CGE), a <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> (<b>NER),</b> defined as energy required to process biofuel divided by energy in the biofuel produced, of 0. 81 and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 30. 03 g CO 2 -eq MJ- 1. High Production costs {{can be attributed to}} operational temperatures of HTL while the high lipid yields of the yeast counter these heating demands, resulting in a favorable NER. The operating conditions of both fermentation and HTL contributed to the majority of GHG emissions. Further discussion focuses on optimization of the process, on the metrics of TEA and LCA and the evaluation of the process, on the metrics of TEA and LCA, and the evaluation of the process through a sensitivity analysis that highlights areas for directed research to improve commercial feasibility...|$|E
40|$|Promising {{energy crops}} such as Jatropha curcas Linnaeus (JCL), which are planted on {{marginal}} lands, or microalgae such as Chlorella, which are cultivated in ponds located on mudflats or deserts, have been regarded with high hopes to solve the shortage of food crops and {{increase the amount of}} biodiesel (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester, FAME) production. However, the annual yields of biomass and transport fuels (t/ha) of both are still unclear and often exaggerated in the literature. Large portions of JCL biomass, including tree trunks and leaves, {{can also be used to}} generate electricity along with FAME, which is produced from seed lipids. Meanwhile, lipid extracted algae (LEA) are composed of proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids other than glycerides which are unable to be esterified to form FAME and much more abundant in the microalgae than oil cake in the oil crops. Therefore, it has been strongly suggested that not only transesterification or esterification but also Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process and bio-electricity generation should be considered as routes to produce biofuels. Otherwise, the yield of biofuel would be extremely low using either JCL or Chlorella as feedstock. The Life-Cycle Inventories (LCI) of the biofuel processes with whole biomass of JCL and Chlorella were compared based on their <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> (<b>NER)</b> and CO 2 emission saving (CES). It was shown that the technological improvement of irrigation, cultivation, and processing for either economic-crops or microalgae were all necessary to meet the requirements of commercial biofuel production...|$|E
40|$|For {{hydrogen}} to be {{a viable}} energy carrier, it is important to develop hydrogen generation routes that are renewable like biohydrogen. Hydrogen can be produced biologically by biophotolysis (direct and indirect), photo-fermentation and dark-fermentation or by combination of these processes (such as integration of dark- and photo-fermentation (two-stage process), or biocatalyzed electrolysis, etc.). However, production of hydrogen by these methods at commercial level is not reported in the literature and challenges regarding the process scale up remain. In this scenario <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> analysis (NEA) can provide a tool for establishing the viability of different methods before scaling up. The analysis {{can also be used to}} set targets for various process and design parameters for bio-hydrogen production. In this paper, four biohydrogen production processes (dark-fermentation, photo-fermentation, two-stage process and biocatalyzed electrolysis) utilizing sugarcane juice as the carbon source, are compared with base case method steam methane reforming (SMR) on the basis of <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>ratio,</b> <b>energy</b> efficiency and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It was found that when by-products are not considered, the efficiencies of biological hydrogen processes are lower than that of SMR. However, these processes reduce GHG emissions and non-renewable energy use by 57 - 73 % and 65 - 79 %, respectively, as compared to the SMR process. Efficiencies of biohydrogen processes increase significantly when by-products are considered hence by-products removal and utilization is an important issue in biological hydrogen production.

40|$|Although {{a number}} of life cycle {{analysis}} studies (LCAs) have been published, there is little consensus on the feasibility of producing algal biofuels sustainably. For example, the <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> (!"#$%& !" !"#$" !"#$%&' !!"#$%& !" !" !!"#$%&'(!"#!!"#"$%&'" !"#$%& !"#$%&) from the reported studies ranges from about 0. 02 to 3. 33. Our work attempted to understand these discrepancies by separating results dependent on subsystem choice or assumed performance from those caused by lack of process knowledge or its variability. Each {{of the life cycle}} stage: algae cultivation, dewatering, oil extraction, and fuel processing are analyzed independently of the other to consider various process options in them. In addition to the process choices made in each stage, the outcomes of any LCA are subject to uncertainty and variability within the model. This study couples LCA with Monte Carlo simulation to propagate the uncertainties from parameters through the modeled processes to the final output. Especially for algal biofuel, implementing uncertainty analysis improves the transparency of the results, considering that no industrial-scale plant is in operation and the algal biofuels industry is in a very early stage with unknown or unreported performance.

40|$|The {{conversion}} of biomass to four different outputs via gasification is a renewable technology that {{could reduce the}} use of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study investigates the energy aspects for a new concept of biomass based quad-generation plant producing power, heat, methanol and methane. Circulating fluidized bed gasifier and the gas technology institute (GTI) gasifier technologies are used for this quad-generation process. Two different biomass feedstocks are considered in this study. The <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> for six different pathways having the range of between 1. 3 and 7. 2. The lowest limit corresponds to the wood chips-based power, heat, methanol and methane production pathway using GTI technology. Since more efficient alternatives exist for the generation of heat and electricity from biomass, {{it is argued that}} syngas is best used for methanol production. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the energy performance, reduce GHG and acid rain precursor emission, and use of biomass for different outputs based on demand. Finally, a sensitivity analysis and a comparative study ar conducted for expected technological improvements and factors that could increase the energy performance...|$|R
