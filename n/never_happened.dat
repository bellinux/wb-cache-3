5|$|Although {{he claimed}} he was {{reluctant}} to enter politics, Hugh Mason became the first Liberal elected councillor for Ashton-under-Lyne in November 1856. He represented the Portland Place ward from 1856 until his retirement from politics in 1874. Mason quickly made an impression and was elected mayor for three consecutive years between 1857 and 1860, which had <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> before. He supported progressive measures such as opening a public park, providing public libraries, and addressing unsanitary conditions in parts of Ashton-under-Lyne.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, Ima {{did not have}} a sister named Ura. Texas legend insists that when Jim Hogg ran for {{re-election}} as Texas governor in 1892 he often travelled with Ima and a friend of hers and introduced them as his daughters Ima and Ura. Ima Hogg maintained throughout her life that this <b>never</b> <b>happened.</b> She was frequently forced to dispel the myth; hundreds of people wrote her letters inquiring whether her name was real and if she really had a sister named Ura. The Kansas City Star even invented another sister, Hoosa.|$|E

It was agreed that Spedding would spend half of each week in Ames, and half in Chicago. The intention was that staff at Ames would eventually move to Chicago when space became available, but this <b>never</b> <b>happened.</b> The success of the Ames Project ensured that it became a separate laboratory within the Manhattan Project.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, before Soviet forces {{attempted}} to invade Finland, the Party Secretary of Leningrad Andrei Zhdanov commissioned a celebratory piece from Shostakovich, entitled Suite on Finnish Themes {{to be performed}} as the marching bands of the Red Army would be parading through the Finnish capital Helsinki. The Winter War was a bitter experience for the Red Army, the parade <b>never</b> <b>happened,</b> and Shostakovich would never lay claim to the authorship of this work. It was not performed until 2001.|$|E
5|$|In 82 Agricola crossed an {{unidentified}} {{body of water}} and defeated peoples unknown to the Romans until then. He fortified the coast facing Ireland, and Tacitus recalls that his father-in-law often claimed the island could be conquered with a single legion and a few auxiliaries. He had given refuge to an exiled Irish king whom he hoped he might use as the excuse for conquest. This conquest <b>never</b> <b>happened,</b> but some historians believe that the crossing referred to {{was in fact a}} small-scale exploratory or punitive expedition to Ireland.|$|E

No details are given of Othelake's career as Ireland King of Arms, although he certainly had a connection with Ireland as an officer of arms to the Earl of March in 1381. The historical evidence does not even make clear how long Othelake served in the position.|$|E

5|$|As the new {{residential}} area suffered from aircraft noise, residents {{joined in the}} demand that the airport be relocated. Despite this, the number of flights to the airport increased as the newly formed Israel Airports Authority strived to reduce congestion at Ben Gurion Airport by shifting all domestic turbo-prop flights to Sde Dov. Once again, the only feasible alternative proposed at this point was to build a runway in the sea and again, {{the high cost of}} this project meant that it <b>never</b> <b>happened.</b> This was a large issue in the area during the whole of the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the ships}} began between late 1863 and early 1864 and they were still being built {{when the war ended}} in early 1865. Construction was {{suspended}} on all four on 17 November 1865; they remained on the stocks. The ships were renamed, usually twice, in 1869 to conform to several new ship naming conventions. Vice Admiral David D. Porter ordered that Colossus be rebuilt to carry 10 large broadside guns and fitted with iron masts in a ship rig, but this <b>never</b> <b>happened.</b> The unseasoned wood in their hulls quickly began to rot after construction was suspended and they were broken up beginning in 1874. Unusually, Passaconaway was condemned by an Act of Congress on 5 August 1882 before she was finally broken up in 1884.|$|E
5|$|However, at two Cabinet {{meetings}} held on 1 April 1965, it {{was decided}} to cancel the TSR-2 on the grounds of projected cost, and instead to obtain an option agreement to acquire up to 110 F-111 aircraft with no immediate commitment to buy. This decision was announced in the budget speech of 6 April 1965. The maiden flight of the second development batch aircraft, XR220, was due {{on the day of the}} announcement, but following an accident in conveying the airframe to Boscombe Down, coupled with the announcement of the project cancellation, it <b>never</b> <b>happened.</b> Ultimately, only the first prototype, XR219, ever took to the air. A week later, the Chancellor defended the decision in a debate in the House of Commons, saying that the F-111 would prove cheaper.|$|E

Andy is initially flattered, but starts to grow uncomfortable when Ron returns for a third shoeshine. This time, Ron makes an involuntary noise that sounds like a sexual moan, seriously embarrassing both men. After a day of avoiding each other, Ron and Andy discuss the noise and decide {{it would be best to}} simply pretend it <b>never</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E

5|$|It {{was during}} this period that the MTO {{undertook}} an engineering review of the entire route in search of cost inefficiencies. Highways 416 and 407 were constructed during a recession in the mid-1990s. Highway407 became a tolled highway {{and for a time}} it was mentioned in legislative debates that Highway416 would also be tolled, but ultimately this <b>never</b> <b>happened.</b> Instead, a hiatus in construction allowed engineers to evaluate inefficiencies in bridge and cross-section designs, as well as sensitive clay soils near Ottawa. This initiative led to a cost savings of over C$7 million and several of the unique design features located {{along the length of the}} freeway.|$|E
