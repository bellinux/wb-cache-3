40|$|Under {{customary}} international law, a state's {{ability to}} espouse {{the claims of}} its nationals and subsequently file a suit against another state {{is limited by the}} rule of incorporation. This has been clear at least since the seminal decision of the International Court of Justice in Barcelona Traction, where it was decided that Belgium could not seek recourse against Spain by espousing the claims of Belgian stockholders in Barcelona Traction, a Canadian company. Equally, claims by locally incorporated entities against the host state are not possible under customary international law. The strict incorporation test has nevertheless become obsolete, if not thrust aside, by the emergence of investment treaties. In fact, the unprecedented and drastic change brought about by investment treaties is all the more evident when considering the whole new array of <b>nationality</b> <b>rules</b> they have solidified. Investment treaties allow for shareholder claims explicitly or by reference to shareholding as one of the covered forms of investment. Some investment treaties go a step further by allowing locally incorporated entities to directly File a claim against the host state, provided that such entities are controlled by nationals or legal entities of the other Contracting Party. Claims by locally incorporated entities are also provided for under the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes Convention ('ICSID Convention'). However, the ICSID Convention, unlike investment treaties, allows for such claims by reference to a 'foreign control' test. Setting out from this premise, this Article does not intend to touch upon all of the <b>nationality</b> <b>rules</b> encountered in modem international investment law. Rather, it focuses on the standing of locally incorporated entities. In particular, it asks whether locally incorporated entities controlled by nationals of the host state qualify as covered investors, and if so, whether {{there is a difference between}} ICSID and non-ICSID claims. In a nutshell, this Article establishes that when a locally incorporated entity files a claim against the host state (the state of its incorporation), the operation of the foreign control test under the ICSID Convention enables an investment tribunal to unlimitedly pierce the corporate veil and assess whether the locally incorporated entity is ultimately controlled by nationals of the host state. In this case, an ICSID tribunal will have to deny the vesting of its jurisdiction because the locally incorporated entity cannot satisfy the foreign control test. This principle was first introduced in 2008 by the tribunal in TSA Spectrum v. Argentina and has recently solidified in the rulings of Burimi v. Albania and National Gas v. Egypt. On the contrary, when nationals of the host state ultimately control a locally incorporated entity but decide to file a claim against the host state through an intermediate company, incorporated in the other Contracting State, the locally incorporated entity is treated as an investment of the intermediate entity. In this case, an ICSID tribunal cannot pierce the corporate veil and assess whether the intermediate company is ultimately controlled by nationals of the host state...|$|E

50|$|Many countries, {{even those}} that permit {{multiple}} citizenship, do not explicitly recognise multiple citizenship under their laws: individuals are treated either as citizens of that country or not, and their citizenship with respect to other countries is considered to have no bearing.

5000|$|Due {{to their}} colonial past, many {{inhabitants}} of the SARs hold some form of non-Chinese nationality (e.g. British National (Overseas) status, British citizenship, British Overseas citizenship or Portuguese citizenship). However, SAR residents who are Chinese descent have always been considered as Chinese citizens by the PRC authorities. Special interpretation of the Nationality Law, while not recognizing dual nationality, has allowed Chinese citizens to keep their foreign [...] "right of abode" [...] and use travel documents issued by the foreign country. However, such travel documents cannot be used to travel to mainland China and persons concerned must use Home Return Permit. Therefore, master <b>nationality</b> <b>rule</b> applies so the holder may not enjoy consular protection while in mainland China.

Furthermore, Hong Kong Chinese nationals who hold such passport or have a right of abode in countries outside the People's Republic of China are not entitled to British (or any other nation's) consular protection inside the People's Republic of China (including Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China), owing to Article 3 of the Nationality Law and the Master <b>Nationality</b> <b>Rule.</b> Such persons are also not allowed to renounce their Chinese nationality by renunciation (unless holding another foreign nationality), as China consider such persons will become stateless upon losing Chinese nationality (as the Chinese authorities does not recognize the British nationality of such persons).|$|R

2500|$|The {{acquisition}} of another country's passport is also deemed under the Citizenship Rules, 1956 to be voluntary {{acquisition of}} another country’s <b>nationality.</b> <b>Rule</b> 3 of Schedule III of the Citizenship Rules, 1956 states that [...] "the {{fact that a}} citizen of India has obtained on any date a passport from the Government of any other country shall be conclusive proof of his/her having voluntarily acquired the citizenship of that country before that date". Again, this rule applies even if the foreign passport was obtained for the child {{by his or her}} parents, and even if possession of such a passport is required by the laws of a foreign country which considers the child to be one of its citizens (e.g., a US-born child of Indian parents who is automatically deemed to be a US citizen according to US law, and who is therefore required by US law to have a US passport in order to enter and leave the US). It does not matter that a person continues to hold an Indian passport. This rule seemingly even applies if the foreign nationality was automatically had from birth, and thus not voluntarily acquired after birth. Persons who acquire another citizenship lose Indian citizenship from the date on which they acquire that citizenship or another country's passport. The prevailing practice at a number of British diplomatic posts, for example, is to impound and return to the Indian authorities the Indian passports of those applicants who apply for and are granted British passports.|$|R

40|$|Powerful {{forces are}} {{transforming}} {{the air transport}} industry's structure. Airline deregulation, privatization, competition and globalization are forcing carriers and regulatory authorities to re-examine historically accepted beliefs. These developments are occurring within the broader context of States pursuing political and economic interdependence and free trade. As such, many nations have abandoned policies that protected specific industries from competition. Instead, countries the world over seek to enhance competition and increase consumer welfare through greater reliance on the marketplace. As governments relinquish their economic control over many industries, business's seek opportunities worldwide. Civil aviation regulation {{is based upon the}} rule that each and every airline must be owned and controlled by a single State, or its nationals. True multinational airline companies are illegal. Thus, to gain the benefits associated with large scale operations and to better serve their customers, airlines are circumventing this restrictive rule through cross-border alliances. Alliances are taking international co-operation to heights previously unknown. Carriers are rapidly integrating their operations and functioning as single economic units offering seamless air services. From such assimilations emerge de facto multinational airlines. The global political and economic environments within which civil aviation functions have been radically altered in recent years. Air transport economics have also changed significantly since aviation's current regulatory framework was created in 1944. This increasingly dynamic industry is rapidly evolving beyond the existing legal regime based as it is upon strictly national carriers. This thesis argues that regulatory authorities must act now and eradicate the anachronistic <b>nationality</b> <b>rule.</b> Permitting multinational airline ownership would eliminate the anti-competitive and highly restrictive bilateral exchange of air traffic rights, bring about free trade in air services and increase consumer benefits...|$|R
