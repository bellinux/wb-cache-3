The trouble with higher error rates may be alleviated by supplementary high quality short reads.

25|$|Other than {{counting}} {{the number of}} ions crossing the channel, sometimes it is desirable to study their behavior at different regions of the channel. Such examples would be the average occupancy of ions or their average moving velocity inside the channel or a <b>nanopore.</b> BioMOCA has been equipped with the option of dumping every ions position, average and instantaneous velocities, potential and kinetic energies, average and instantaneous displacements and other info at every step (or few steps) of the simulations in ASCII format, so such trajectory information could be studied later on to gather further statistics. From a technical point of view however, dumping such information for tens of ions, even at every few hundreds of time steps, could slow down the simulations and end up with huge files accumulating to tens of gigabytes. Loading such files later on from disk storage is also a very time consuming and computationally inefficient procedure. Over and above that, recoding the numerical information in ASCII format does not hold its machine precision and has loss of accuracy.|$|E

The magnitude of the electric current density across a <b>nanopore</b> surface depends on the nanopore's dimensions and the composition of DNA or RNA that is occupying the <b>nanopore.</b> Sequencing is made possible because, when close enough to nanopores, samples cause characteristic changes in electric current density across <b>nanopore</b> surfaces.

40|$|AbstractThe {{predictions}} {{of a theory}} for the anomalous mole fraction effect (AMFE) are tested experimentally with synthetic <b>nanopores</b> in plastic. The negatively charged synthetic <b>nanopores</b> under consideration are highly cation selective and 50 Å in diameter at their smallest point. These pores exhibit an AMFE in mixtures of Ca 2 + and monovalent cations. An AMFE occurs when the conductance through a pore is lower {{in a mixture of}} salts than in the pure salts at the same concentration. For ion channels, the textbook interpretation of the AMFE is that multiple ions move through the pore in coordinated, single-file motion. However, because the synthetic <b>nanopores</b> are so wide, their AMFE shows that single filing is not necessary for the AMFE. It is shown that the AMFE in the synthetic <b>nanopores</b> is explained by a theory of preferential ion selectivity. The unique properties of the synthetic <b>nanopores</b> allow us to experimentally confirm several {{predictions of}} this theory. These same properties make synthetic <b>nanopores</b> an interesting new platform to test theories of ion channel permeation and selectivity in general...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn fluid {{transport}} across <b>nanopores,</b> {{there is}} a fundamental dissipation that arises from the connection between the pore and the macroscopic reservoirs.

In this paper, we explore the hydrodynamic permeability of hourglass shape <b>nanopores</b> using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with the central pore size ranging from several nanometers down to a few Angströms. Surprisingly, we find a very good agreement between MD results and continuum hydrodynamic predictions, even for the smallest systems undergoing single file transport of water. An optimum of permeability is found for an opening angle around 5 degree, in agreement with continuum predictions, yielding a permeability five times larger than for a straight nanotube. Moreover, we find that the permeability of hourglass shape <b>nanopores</b> is even larger than single <b>nanopores</b> pierced in a molecular thin graphene sheet.
