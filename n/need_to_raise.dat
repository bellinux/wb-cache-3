5|$|A National Park Service {{spokesperson}} {{reported that}} surveys revealed cracks {{near the top}} of the Washington Monument, the world's tallest stone structure, which remained closed for repairs until May 2014. The earthquake severely damaged three of the four pinnacles (corner spires) on the central tower of the Washington National Cathedral, cracked some of its flying buttresses, and caused additional damage. As the cathedral's insurance policy did not cover earthquake damage, cathedral officials stated that they would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> millions of dollars to fully evaluate the damage and to stabilize and repair its limestone exterior.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimation}} that 300 senators were proscribed {{was presented}} by Appian, although his earlier contemporary Livy asserted that only 130 senators had been proscribed. This decree {{issued by the}} triumvirate was motivated {{in part by a}} <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> money to pay the salaries of their troops for the upcoming conflict against Caesar's assassins, Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger and Gaius Cassius Longinus. Rewards for their arrest gave incentive for Romans to capture those proscribed, while the assets and properties of those arrested were seized by the triumvirs.|$|E
5|$|Historian R. E. Smith {{notes that}} there was a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> {{additional}} legions in an emergency to repel specific strategic threats. He argues that this may have resulted in two types of legion. Long-standing legions deployed overseas were probably professional troops forming a standing army. Quickly-formed new legions, in contrast, consisted of younger men, perhaps with little or no military experience, who hoped for adventure and plunder. However, no distinction in basic pay, discipline or armour is known of between the two types of legion. The practice of veteran troops signing up again voluntarily into newly raised legions must have meant that no one army conformed exactly to one or other of these theoretical archetypes.|$|E

5|$|Żółkiewski {{began to}} write his memoirs after his return from Muscovy. The Początek i progres wojny moskiewskiej (The {{beginning}} and Progress of the Muscovy War), published in 1612, is a critique of Zygmunt's policies. In 1612 he became a teacher and tutor of Stanisław Koniecpolski, future hetman and military commander. Also that year he returned to Ukraine to defend against continuing Tatar and Moldovan incursions, as well as Cossack unrest. In 1616 during a Sejm he presented a project O chowaniu żołnierza kwarcianego (On the raising of the kwarciane soldiers), in which he argued for the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> a larger army {{to deal with the}} Tatars and the Cossacks.

5|$|Combs' uninspiring {{speeches and}} candidness {{about the need}} for more state revenue cost him the primary election. Chandler, who went on to reclaim the governorship, had promised that he would not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> taxes to meet the state's {{financial}} obligations, but ultimately he did so. This damaged Chandler's credibility and left Combs looking courageous and honest {{in the eyes of the}} electorate. Consequently, in 1959 Combs was elected governor, defeating Lieutenant Governor Harry Lee Waterfield, Chandler's choice to succeed him in office, in the primary. Early in his term, Combs secured passage of a three-percent sales tax to pay a bonus to the state's military veterans. Knowing a tax of one percent would have been sufficient, he used the excess revenue to enact a system of reforms, including expansion of the state's highway and state park systems. He also devoted much of the surplus to education.|$|E
5|$|Early {{polls showed}} that Beshear and Henry led the Democratic field in name recognition, but both trailed Fletcher and his Republican primary rival Anne Northup in that area. Early in the campaign, Beshear {{attempted}} to set himself {{apart from the}} other candidates by supporting a constitutional amendment that would allow expanded casino gambling in the state, which he claimed could generate $500 million in new revenue without the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> taxes. Observers noted that this strategy was remarkably {{similar to the one}} used by Wallace Wilkinson who, in his 1987 primary victory over Beshear and others, trumpeted the revenue a state lottery would generate. Initially, all of the Democratic candidates except Hensley endorsed a casino amendment, but as Beshear made it the centerpiece of his campaign, support from other candidates began to waver; Richards officially changed his position to oppose the amendment, while several other candidates charged that Beshear was staking too much of his platform on a proposal that was not guaranteed to pass.|$|E

5|$|Stephen's {{first few}} years as king can be {{interpreted}} in different ways. From a positive perspective, he stabilised the northern border with Scotland, contained Geoffrey's attacks on Normandy, was at peace with Louis VI, enjoyed {{good relations with the}} church and had the broad support of his barons. There were significant underlying problems, nonetheless. The north of England was now controlled by David and Prince Henry, Stephen had abandoned Wales, the fighting in Normandy had considerably destabilised the duchy, and an increasing number of barons felt that Stephen had given them neither the lands nor the titles they felt they deserved or were owed. Stephen was also rapidly running out of money: Henry's considerable treasury had been emptied by 1138 due to the costs of running Stephen's more lavish court and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> and maintain his mercenary armies fighting in England and Normandy.|$|E

25|$|The <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> {{funds to}} improve and expand {{operations}} {{during the second half}} of 1931 was answered by Abe Cahan, editor and publisher of the social democratic Jewish Daily Forward, the largest Yiddish-language newspaper in the world. Cahan was firmly committed to the importance of the project and he made the newspapers funds freely available, depositing $70,000 on account in the fall of 1931 for the expansion of the station assuming the renewal of its broadcast license. Together with previous and subsequent cash infusions, the Forward had invested $200,000 in WEVD by the end of that year.|$|E
25|$|The <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> {{money for}} the support of the {{federation}} lead to a series of economic measures that were unpopular with the majority of the population. Among these were tributes and expropriations of uncultivated land. The latter especially was a blow to the Indigenous, who during colonial times had retained the right to practice slash-and-burn agriculture in lands not occupied by haciendas. Now the haciendas expanded and the land available for subsistence agriculture by the Indigenous shrank. Forced labor in mines and fields also continued. Thus this group, already at a disadvantage socially since the arrival of the Spaniards, became more disadvantaged with the arrival of independence.|$|E
25|$|The SM83, ST86 and ST89 {{were not}} subject to the cable and braking issue and were {{therefore}} kept in service. Originally Oslo ordered seventeen SL95s and planned to keep either the SM83 or the SM91 units. However, the options for another fifteen SL95s was redeemed, allowing all non-articulated trams to be retired. As the SL95 units were delivered, retirement of SM83 commenced in mid 1999. The choice to retire SM83 before SM91 was both that the former were in worse technical condition and that the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the voltage on the tramway to 750 volts.

A move away from Saltergate was proposed again in 1949, this time to a site near Walton Hospital, but the council rejected the plan. Instead, the club made what was to be its final major investment in the ground prior to the millennium, engaging Leitch and Partners to renew all the ground's cinder terracing with concrete and install their patented crush barriers.|$|E
25|$|In February 2017, the Village Voice {{examined}} the BQX project's cost {{and found that}} the city had only tenuous sources of funding for the project.

However, to pay for the BQX, the streetcar alone would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> tax by another 17%, or else the city would need to resort to financing the streetcar out of its own budget. In addition, there would be less benefit in building in already-gentrified neighborhoods than in neighborhoods that are gentrifying or being redeveloped.
