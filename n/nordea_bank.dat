The public sector debt-liabilities still outstanding 1 January 2008 {{in accordance with the}} Eurostat EMU-debt numbers (gross debt) are 440.9 billion DKK (26.0% of GDP).

The central government is determined to pay off the debt as fast as possible, avoiding the temptation to increase spending which might overheat the economy (increase wages and eventually prices drastically) because of a short supply of skilled labor and in the end require financial austerity measures to cool off the economy.
