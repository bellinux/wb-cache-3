25|$|Researchers {{concluded}} that, if Genie vocalized or {{made any}} other noise, her father beat {{her with a}} large plank he kept in her room. To keep her quiet he bared his teeth and barked and growled at her like a wild dog, and grew his fingernails out to scratch her. If he suspected her of doing something he did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> made these noises outside the door, and beat her if he believed she had continued to do it, instilling an intense and persistent fear of cats and dogs in Genie. No one definitively discerned the exact reason for his dog-like behavior, although at least one scientist speculated he may have viewed himself as a guard dog and was acting out the role. As a result, Genie learned to make as little sound as possible and to otherwise give no outward expressions. Genie developed a tendency to masturbate in socially inappropriate contexts, which led doctors to seriously {{consider the possibility that}} Genie's father subjected her to sexual abuse or forced her brother to do so, although they never uncovered any definite evidence.|$|E

500|$|... "Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows" [...] (January 17, 2002), a Family Guy episode which Povenmire directed, won the Emmy Award for Best Song. Creator MacFarlane, the {{recipient}} of the award, noted that Povenmire deserved to have received the award for the contribution the visuals made to the episode's win. Povenmire jokingly responded [...] "That's a nice sentiment and all, but did he offer to give me his? No! And it's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> doesn't already have two of his own just sitting in his house!" [...] Povenmire was nominated for an Annie Award for Directing in an Animated Television Production for the episode [...] "PTV" [...] (November 6, 2005) but lost out to a fellow Family Guy director Peter Shin, who had directed the episode [...] "North By North Quahog".

[...] Though Zayat talked of retiring the horse, Baffert said, [...] "We knew we were doing the impossible, shipping him back and forth." [...] The following day, Baffert said that American Pharoah was healthy and came out of the race in good shape. He said he had no regrets, stating, [...] "I'm glad I brought him. Racing needed something like this. He almost pulled it off." [...] Regarding Zayat's talk of retiring the horse, Baffert said, [...] "Mr. Zayat is a very emotional man. We were all pretty disappointed... I know (Zayat) will be going back and forth... He's a sportsman for bringing him up here." [...] Five days later, Zayat announced that the horse would be kept in training with the goal to run in the Breeders' Cup Classic, stating, [...] "I believe there were a combination of factors that prevented American Pharoah from running his absolute best... I have every confidence that he can run to his best again, and he deserves the chance to do so." ...|$|E
500|$|During the off-season, the Capitals {{made several}} player changes. One {{of the players}} that was not {{retained}} by the team, Matt Bradley, started a controversy with his comments from a radio interview in Ottawa. In the interview, Bradley said his former team was [...] "a little bit too nonchalant and guys weren’t disciplined the way they should have been," [...] which he claimed were the two biggest reasons why the team {{was not able to}} advance past {{the second round of the}} Stanley Cup playoffs. He later stated that Head Coach Bruce Boudreau did not give the most ice time to players who were playing well, but went with his star players. He further noted that Boudreau was a [...] "great coach" [...] who had been put in a tough position. When asked to point out examples, Bradley stated that Alexander Semin [...] "could easily be the best player in the league," [...] but he [...] "just doesn’t care," [...] further noting, [...] "When you've got a guy like that, you need him to be your best player, or one of your best players, and when he doesn't show up, you almost get the sense that he wants to be back in Russia." [...] Semin's agent came to his client's defense, stating he [...] "always cares." [...] Teammate Mike Knuble noted that because Semin speaks limited English, the language barrier affects the way that he is perceived, further noting that the interview comments were something Bradley regretted. When asked about the comments, former Capitals forward David Steckel stated that, [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> went out and told lies." [...] Bradley later apologized for his comments in an interview with the Sun Sentinel.|$|E

He also advocated extended suffrage, equality before the law, and religious tolerance. His enemies branded him as a Leveller but Lilburne responded {{that he was a}} [...] "Leveller so-called." [...] To him it was a pejorative label which he did <b>not</b> <b>like.</b> <b>He</b> called his supporters [...] "Agitators."

2500|$|Luther Robinson {{was born}} in Richmond, Virginia, and raised in its Jackson Ward neighborhood. His parents were Maxwell, a machine-shop worker, and Maria Robinson, a choir singer.

Details of Robinson's early life are known only through legend, much of it perpetuated by Robinson himself. He claimed he was christened [...] "Luther"—a name he did <b>not</b> <b>like.</b> <b>He</b> suggested to his younger brother Bill that they should exchange names. Eventually, the exchange between the names of both brothers was made.|$|E

[...] Grier writes that her doctor warned her about what he termed the [...] "epidemic." [...] He asked if perhaps Pyror put cocaine on his penis to sustain his erection, to which she replied, [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> has a pile of cocaine next to the bed and he dips his penis in it before we have sex." [...] The doctor advised her to use condoms then asked her if her mouth went numb while performing oral sex on Pryor, she says it did, he linked it the Novocaine-like effects of cocaine. Grier confronted Richard about protecting her health to which he said, “I hate condoms. I can’t feel anything.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Steven Moffat {{has said}} that {{reference}} {{will be made to}} Peter Capaldi's previous appearances in the Whoniverse during his tenure as the Twelfth Doctor: [...] "The face is not set from birth. It’s <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was always going to be one day Peter Capaldi. We know that’s the case because in The War Games he has a choice of faces. So we know it’s not set, so where does he get those faces from? They can’t just be randomly generated because they've got lines. They've aged. When he turns into Peter he’ll actually have lines on his face. So where did that face come from?” In [...] "Deep Breath" [...] (2014), the Doctor and several other characters speculate about where his new face came from, given that it has lines from frowning. The Doctor considers aloud that it is a face he recognises from somewhere, but due to post-regenerative trauma, he cannot place it. In [...] "The Girl Who Died" [...] (2015), he concludes that he subconsciously chose the face as a reminder of his decision {{to save the life of}} Caecilius (also played by Capaldi) in [...] "The Fires of Pompeii" [...] (2008) and to remind him to save people even with possible historical consequences by doing so.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the shows}} 2007 Christmas celebrations, Morrison was {{approached}} by cast members Michael Galvin (Chris Warner), Craig Parker (Guy Warner) and producer Jason Daniel. The trio offered Morrison {{a return to the}} show citing the high ratings, which he accepted and later jokingly blamed on Daniel force feeding him beer. Morrison agreed on the condition that the character could ride a Harley-Davidson motorbike and could date a [...] "hot" [...] woman. It was announced in March 2008 that Morrison would be reprising his role of Hone after 13 years to mark the shows 4000th episode. Morrison was signed to an initial 6 week contract, but Morrison was open to a potential extension or even a full-time role. Daniel was pleased with Morrison's return, [...] "We've constructed a story that makes it interesting for Tem to come back and play so that it's not just more of the same. It's his character under pressure and with a series of challenges that make it an interesting journey for him as a character and an interesting challenge for Tem." [...] Hone's return aired on 5 June 2008 on episode 3999. Morrison proved to be problematic on set; not remembering his lines, being uncomfortable filming emotional scenes, and not arriving on set when he had to film something he did <b>not</b> <b>like.</b> <b>He</b> departed following the conclusion of his six-week contract. Morrison was not asked to reprise the role for the shows 20th anniversary in 2012. In 2014 Rene Naufahu (Paramedic Sam Aleni) suggested bringing back Morrison so that the former co stars could [...] "forget their lines" [...] together.|$|E
