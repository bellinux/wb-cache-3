40|$|Abstract Alexithymia is a {{personality}} trait characterized by difficulties in identifying and describing feelings and {{is associated with}} psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders. The mechanisms underlying the link between emotional dysregulation and psychosomatic disorders are unclear. Recent progress in neuroimaging has provided important information regarding emotional experience in alexithymia. We have conducted three brain imaging studies on alexithymia, which we describe herein. This article considers the role of emotion {{in the development of}} physical symptoms and discusses a possible pathway that we have identified in our neuroimaging studies linking alexithymia with psychosomatic disorders. In terms of socio-affective processing, alexithymics demonstrate lower reactivity in brain regions associated with emotion. Many studies have reported reduced activation in limbic areas (e. g., cingulate cortex, anterior insula, amygdala) and the prefrontal cortex when alexithymics attempt to feel other people’s feelings or retrieve their own emotional episodes, compared to nonalexithymics. With respect to primitive emotional reactions such as the response to pain, alexithymics show amplified activity in areas considered to be involved in physical sensation. In addition to greater hormonal arousal responses in alexithymics during visceral pain, increased activity has been reported in the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and midbrain. Moreover, in complex social situations, alexithymics {{may not be able to}} use feelings to guide their behavior appropriately. The Iowa gambling task (IGT) was developed to assess decision-making processes based on emotion-guided evaluation. When alexithymics perform the IGT, they fail to learn an advantageous decision-making strategy and show reduced activity in the medial prefrontal cortex, a key area for successful performance of the IGT, and increased activity in the caudate, a region associated with impulsive choice. The <b>neural</b> <b>machinery</b> <b>in</b> alexithymia is therefore activated more on the physiologic, motor-expressive level and less in the cognitive-experiential domains of the emotional response system. Affects may play an important role in alleviating intrinsic physiologic reactions and adapting to the environment. Deficient development of emotional neural structures may lead to hypersensitivity to bodily sensations and unhealthy behaviors, a possible mechanism linking alexithymia to psychosomatic disorders. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} adapt to a {{changing}} environment is central to an organism’s success. The process of associating two stimuli (as in associative conditioning) requires very {{little in the way of}} <b>neural</b> <b>machinery.</b> <b>In</b> fact, organisms with only a few hundred neurons show conditioning that is specific to an associated cue. This type of learning is commonly referred to as implicit learning. The learning can be performed in the absence of the subject’s ability to describe it. One example of learning that is thought to be implicit is delay conditioning. Delay conditioning consists of a single cue (a tone, for example) that starts before, and then overlaps with, an outcome (like a pain stimulus). In addition to associating sensory cues, humans routinely link abstract concepts with an outcome. This more complex learning is often described as explicit since subjects are able to describe the link between the stimulus and outcome. An example of conditioning that requires this type of knowledge is trace conditioning. Trace conditioning includes a separation of a few seconds between the cue and outcome. Explicit learning is often proposed to involve a separate system, but the degree of separation between implicit associations and explicit learning is still debated. We describe aversive conditioning experiments in human subjects used to study the degree of interaction that takes place between explicit and implicit systems. We do this in three ways. First, if a higher order task (in this case a working memory task) is performed during conditioning, it reduces not only explicit learning but also implicit learning. Second, we describe the area of the brain involved in explicit learning during conditioning and confirm that it is active during both trace and delay conditioning. Third, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we describe hemodynamic activity changes in perceptual areas of the brain that occur during delay conditioning and persist after the learned association has faded. From these studies, we conclude that there is a strong interaction between explicit and implicit learning systems, with one often directly changing the function of the other. </p...|$|R

40|$|Consciousness fully supervenes {{when the}} 1. 5 kgm mass of {{protoplasm}} {{in the head}} directs the body into material and social environments and engages in reciprocity. While consciousness is not susceptible to direct measurement, a limited form exercised in animals and pre-lingual children can be measured indirectly with biological assays of arousal, intention and attention. In this essay consciousness is viewed as operating simultaneously in a field at all levels ranging from subatomic to social. The relations and transpositions between levels require sophisticated mathematical treatments that are largely still to be devised. In anticipation of those developments the available experimental data are reviewed concerning the state variables in several levels that collectively constitute the substrate of biological consciousness. The basic metaphors are described that represent the <b>neural</b> <b>machinery</b> of transposition <b>in</b> consciousness.

40|$|A {{possible}} neurobiological {{basis for}} the “oblique effect” {{is linked to the}} finding that more <b>neural</b> <b>machinery</b> is devoted to processing cardinal vs. oblique orientations in primary visual cortex (V 1). We used optical imaging to determine whether more territory is devoted to processing horizontal and vertical orientations than oblique orientations in owl monkey middle temporal visual area (MT), a visual area highly sensitive to moving stimuli. We found that more of MT was devoted to representing cardinal than oblique orientations, and that the anisotropy was more prominent in parts of MT representing central vision (≤ 10 °). Neural responses to orientations of 0 ° and 90 ° were also greater than those to 45 ° and 135 °. In comparison, an overrepresentation of cardinal orientations in the representation of central vision in owl monkey V 1 was relatively small and inconsistent. Our data could explain the greater sensitivity to motion discrimination when stimuli are moved along cardinal meridians and suggest that the <b>neural</b> <b>machinery</b> necessary to explain the motion oblique effect either originates in MT or is enhanced at this level...|$|R

A {{purpose of this study}} is to examine relationships between psychological process of splitting and disturbed cognitive and affective functions <b>in</b> <b>schizophrenia</b> and borderline personality disorder (BPD). METHODS: In the clinical study, we have assessed 30 patients with schizophrenia and 35 patients with BPD. The symptoms of splitting were measured using self-reported Splitting Index (SI). As a measure of semantic memory disorganization we have used verbal fluency test. Other psychopathological symptoms were assessed using Health of the Nation Outcome Scale (HoNOS). RESULTS: Main results show that SI is significantly higher in BPD group than <b>in</b> <b>schizophrenia,</b> and on the other hand, verbal fluency is significantly lower <b>in</b> <b>schizophrenia</b> group.

40|$|Although {{disturbed}} {{sleep is}} a prominent feature of schizophrenia, {{its relation to}} the pathophysiology, signs, and symptoms of schizophrenia remains poorly understood. Sleep disturbances are well known to impair cognition in healthy individuals. Yet, {{in spite of its}} ubiquity <b>in</b> <b>schizophrenia,</b> abnormal sleep has generally been overlooked as a potential contributor to cognitive deficits. Amelioration of cognitive deficits is a current priority of the schizophrenia research community, but most efforts to define, characterize, and quantify cognitive deficits focus on cross-sectional measures. While this approach provides a valid snapshot of function, there is now overwhelming evidence that critical aspects of learning and memory consolidation happen offline, both over time and with sleep. Initial memory encoding is followed by a prolonged period of consolidation, integration, and reorganization, that continues over days or even years.
