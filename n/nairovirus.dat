We show that the OTU domain-containing proteases from <b>nairoviruses</b> and arteriviruses, two unrelated groups of RNA viruses, hydrolyze Ub and ISG 15 from cellular target proteins. This broad activity contrasts with the target specificity of known mammalian OTU domain-containing proteins. Expression of a viral OTU domain-containing protein antagonizes the antiviral effects of ISG 15 and enhances susceptibility to Sindbis virus infection in vivo. We also show that viral OTU domain-containing proteases inhibit NF-κB-dependent signaling.

40|$|Abstract The Bunyaviridae {{family of}} enveloped RNA viruses {{includes}} five genuses, orthobunyaviruses, hantaviruses, phleboviruses, <b>nairoviruses</b> and tospoviruses.

Class II viral fusion proteins (beta-penetrenes), encoded {{by members of the}} Alphaviridae and Flaviviridae, are comprised of three antiparallel beta sheet domains with an internal fusion peptide located at the end of domain II. Proteomics computational analyses indicate that the carboxyl terminal glycoprotein (Gc) encoded by Sandfly fever virus (SAN), a phlebovirus, has a significant amino acid sequence similarity with envelope protein 1 (E 1), the class II fusion protein of Sindbis virus (SIN), an Alphavirus. Similar sequences and common structural/functional motifs, including domains with a high propensity to interface with bilayer membranes, are located collinearly in SAN Gc and SIN E 1. Gc encoded by members of each Bunyavirus genus share several sequence and structural motifs. These results suggest that Gc of Bunyaviridae, and similar proteins of Tenuiviruses and a group of Caenorhabditis elegans retroviruses, are class II viral fusion proteins.

40|$|Crimean Congo {{hemorrhagic fever}} virus (CCHFV) {{is a highly}} virulent tick-borne {{pathogen}} that causes hemorrhagic fever in humans.

The prevalence of antibody in cattle sera was 905 / 2116 (42. 8 %) for CCHF virus, 70 / 1358 (5. 2 %) for Dugbe, 21 / 1358 (1. 5 %) for louping ill, 6 / 450 (1. 3 %) for West Nile, 7 / 1358 (0. 5 %) for Nairobi sheep disease, 3 / 625 (0. 5 %) for Kadam and 2 / 450 (0. 4 %) for Chenuda.

40|$|Background: The genus <b>Nairovirus</b> in {{the family}} Bunyaviridae {{contains}} 34 tick-borne viruses classified into seven serogroups. Hazara virus (HAZV) belongs to the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) serogroup that also includes CCHF virus (CCHFV) a major pathogen for humans. HAZV is an interesting model to study CCHFV due to a close serological and phylogenetical relationship and a classification which allows handling in a BSL 2 laboratory. Nairoviruses are characterized by a tripartite negative-sense single stranded RNA genome (named L, M and S segments) that encode the RNA polymerase, the Gn-Gc glycoproteins and the nucleoprotein (NP), respectively. Currently, there are neither vaccines nor effective therapies {{for the treatment of}} any bunyavirus infection in humans. In this study we report, for the first time, the use of RNA interference (RNAi) as an approach to inhibit <b>nairovirus</b> replication. Results: Chemically synthesized siRNAs were designed to target the mRNA produced by the three genomic segments. We first demonstrated that the siRNAs targeting the NP mRNA displayed a stronger antiviral effect than those complementary to the L and M transcripts in A 549 cells. We further characterized the two most efficient siRNAs showing, that the induced inhibition is specific and associated with a decrease in NP synthesis during HAZV infection. Furthermore, both siRNAs depicted an antiviral activity when used before and after HAZV infection. We next showed that HAZV was sensitive to ribavirin which is also known to inhibit CCHFV. Finally, we demonstrated the additive or synergistic antiviral effect of siRNAs used in combination with ribavirin. Conclusions: Our study highlights the interest of using RNAi (alone or in combination with ribavirin) to treat <b>nairovirus</b> infection. This approach has to be considered for the development of future antiviral compounds targeting CCHFV, the most pathogenic <b>nairovirus.</b> Background Hazara virus (HAZV) {{is a member of the}} genus <b>Nairovirus</b> of the family Bunyaviridae which also include...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Nairoviruses</b> are an {{important}} group of tick-borne viruses that includes pathogens of man (Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus) and livestock animals (Dugbe virus, Nairobi sheep disease virus (NSDV)). NSDV is found in large parts of East Africa and the Indian subcontinent (where it is known as Ganjam virus). We have investigated the ability of NSDV to antagonise the induction and actions of interferon. Both pathogenic and apathogenic isolates could actively inhibit the induction of type 1 interferon, and also blocked the signalling pathways of both type 1 and type 2 interferons. Using transient expression of viral proteins or sections of viral proteins, these activities all mapped to the ovarian tumour-like protease domain (OTU) found in the viral RNA polymerase. Virus infection, or expression of this OTU domain in transfected cells, led to a great reduction in the incorporation of ubiquitin or ISG 15 protein into host cell proteins. Point mutations in the OTU that inhibited the protease activity also prevented it from antagonising interferon induction and action. Interestingly, a mutation at a peripheral site, which had little apparent effect {{on the ability of}} the OTU to inhibit ubiquitination and ISG 15 ylation, removed the ability of the OTU to block the induction of type 1 and the action of type 2 interferons, but had a lesser effect on the ability to block type 1 interferon action, suggesting that targets other tha...|$|R
40|$|The {{attachment}} of ubiquitin (Ub) and the Ub-like (Ubl) molecule interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG 15) to {{cellular proteins}} mediates important innate antiviral responses. Ovarian tumor (OTU) domain proteases from <b>nairoviruses</b> and arteriviruses were recently found to remove these molecules from host proteins, which inhibits Ub and ISG 15 -dependent antiviral pathways. This {{contrasts with the}} Ub-specific activity of known eukaryotic OTU-domain proteases. Here we describe crystal structures of a viral OTU domain from the highly pathogenic Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) bound to Ub and to ISG 15 at 2. 5 -Å and 2. 3 -Å resolution, respectively. The complexes provide a unique structural example of ISG 15 bound to another protein and reveal the molecular mechanism of an ISG 15 cross-reactive deubiquitinase. To accommodate structural differences between Ub and ISG 15, the viral protease binds the β-grasp folds of Ub and C-terminal Ub-like domain of ISG 15 in an orientation that is rotated nearly 75 ° with respect to that observed for Ub bound to a representative eukaryotic OTU domain from yeast. Distinct structural determinants necessary for binding either substrate were identified and allowed the reengineering of the viral OTU protease into enzymes with increased substrate specificity, either for Ub or for ISG 15. Our findings now provide the basis to determine in vivo the relative contributions of deubiquitination and deISGylation to viral immune evasion tactics, and a structural template of a promiscuous deubiquitinase from a haemorrhagic fever virus that can be targeted for inhibition using small-molecule-based strategies...|$|R
