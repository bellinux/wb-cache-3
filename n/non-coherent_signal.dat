In this letter, a low-complexity and <b>non-coherent</b> <b>signal</b> detection technique is proposed to mitigate the inter-symbol-interference (ISI) and additive noise. In contrast to existing coherent detection methods of high complexity, the proposed <b>non-coherent</b> <b>signal</b> detector is more practical when the channel conditions are hard to acquire accurately or hidden from the receiver. The proposed scheme employs the concentration difference to detect the ISI corrupted signals and we demonstrate that it can suppress the ISI effectively. The concentration difference is a stable characteristic, irrespective of the diffusion channel conditions. In terms of complexity, by excluding matrix operations or likelihood calculations, the new detection scheme is particularly suitable for nano-scale molecular communication systems with a small energy budget or limited computation resource.

The DOD-DOA pair of the k-th signal i̇s_k(t)=β _k e^j 2 π f_kt is denoted by θk,ϕk, k= 1, 2,⋯,K 1, where βk and fk represent the complex attenuation coefficient and Doppler frequency, respectively.

40|$|In this paper, a source-assisting {{differential}} distributed {{space time}} block coding (SA-DDSTBC) scheme is proposed for cooperative networks. Firstly, in most existing works on distributed space time block coding (DSTBC), the destination node {{is assumed to}} have perfect channel state information (CSI), thus, signal recovery is straight forward. In practice however, some scenarios exist whereby the destination node is unable to acquire CSI. Consequently, this work incorporates differential concepts with DSTBC to facilitate signal recovery in cooperative networks operating in environments where CSI acquisition is impractical. Secondly, different from most works on DSTBC which assume that the source-destination link is unavailable, the proposed scheme employs a source-assisting (SA) strategy that exploits the additional diversity path provided by the source-destination link. The numerical and simulation results obtained illustrate that compared to the conventional DSTBC schemes, the proposed SA-DDSTBC scheme achieves <b>non-coherent</b> <b>signal</b> recovery and improved BER and diversity performance with negligible increase in decoding complexity. ?? 2013 IEEE...|$|E

The small-scale and line-of-sight fading distribution consists of particular examples such as Rayleigh, Hoyt, Nakagami-m and one sided Gaussian distributions. Based on this, we derive the probability density function of signal envelope and signal-to-noise ratio of the composite shadowed fading channels, which could accurately present the line-of-sight shadowed fading characterization. Subsequently the exact close-form expressions with infinite series formulation for the appropriate detection probability have been firstly extended to estimate detection capacity of the above-mentioned model by adopting Inverse Gaussian asymptotic distribution. In addition, the absolute truncation error is deduced for evaluating minimum detection efficiency. The established model can be also applied in detection estimation with non-integral fading parameters. Last but not least, the analytical results and quantification performance are approved by numerically evaluation with MATHEMATICA and MATLAB as the power variables of dominant components changes.

40|$|The {{demands for}} high data rates and {{broadband}} wireless access require the development of wireless systems that can support wide and multi-band signals. To deploy these signals, new radio frequency (RF) front-ends are required which impose new challenges in terms of power consumption efficiency and sources of distortion e. g., nonlinearity. These challenges are more pronounced in power amplifiers (PAs) that degrade the overall performance of the RF transmitter. Since {{it is difficult to}} optimize the linearity and efficiency characteristics of a PA simultaneously, a trade-off is needed. At high input power, a PA exhibits high efficiency at the expense of linearity. On the other hand, at low input power, a PA is linear {{at the expense of the}} efficiency. To achieve linearity and efficiency at the same time, digital pre-distortion (DPD) is often used to compensate for the PA nonlinearity at high input power. In case of multi-channel PAs, input and output signals of different channels interact with each other due to cross-talk. Therefore, these PAs exhibit different nonlinear behavior than the single-input single-output (SISO) PAs. The DPD techniques developed for SISO PAs do not result in adequate performance when used for multi-channel PAs. Hence, an accurate behavioral modeling is essential for the development of DPD for multi-channel RF PAs. In this thesis, we propose three novel behavioral models and DPD schemes for nonlinear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmitters in presence of cross-talk. A study of the source of cross-talk in MIMO transmitters have been investigated to derive simple and powerful modeling schemes. These models are extensions of a SISO generalized memory polynomial model. A comparative study with a previously published MIMO model is also presented. The effect of coherent and partially <b>non-coherent</b> <b>signal</b> generationon DPD performance is also highlighted. It is shown experimentally that with partially <b>non-coherent</b> <b>signal</b> generation, the performance of the DPD degrades compared to coherent signal generation. In context of multi-channel RF transmitters, PA behavioral models and DPD schemes suffer from a large number of model parameters with the increase in nonlinear order and memory depth. This growth leads to high complexity model identification and implementation. We have designed a DPD scheme for MIMO PAs using a sparse estimation technique for reducing model complexity. This technique also increases the numerical stability when linear least square estimation model identification is used. A method to characterize the memory effects in a nonlinear concurrent dual-band PAs is also presented. Compared to the SISO PAs, concurrent dual-band PAs are not only affected by intermodulation distortions but also by cross-modulation distortions. The characterization of memory effects inconcurrent dual-band transmitter is performed by injecting a two-tone test signal in each input channel of the transmitter. Asymmetric energy surfaces are introduced for the intermodulation and cross-modulation products, which can be used to identify the power and frequency regions where the memory effects are dominant.

40|$|Applications like sensor networks, medical monitoring, and asset {{tracking}} {{have led to}} a demand for energy-efficient and low-cost wireless transceivers. These types of applications typically require low effective data rates, thus providing an opportunity to employ simple modulation schemes and aggressive duty-cycling. Due to their inherently duty-cycled nature, pulsed-UWB systems {{have been shown to be}} amenable to low-power operation [1, 2]. Furthermore, the use of <b>non-coherent</b> <b>signaling</b> greatly simplifies both transmitter and receiver implementations, offering substantial energy savings [3]. This work presents an all-digital transmitter designed for a non-coherent pulsed-UWB system. By exploiting the fact that center frequency tolerances are relaxed in wideband non-coherent communication, the transmitter can synthesize UWB pulses from an energy-efficient, single-ended digital ring oscillator. To generate phase modulated pulses (which are required for spectral scrambling purposes), the oscillator output is fed to two banks of parallel tri-state inverters, shown in Figure 1. Maintaining opposite common modes at the output of these inverters during idle mode (i. e., when no pulses are being transmitted) eliminates low-frequency turn-on and turn-off transients typically associated with single-ended digital circuits driving single-ended antennas. Thus, no area-expensive balun is required to generate BPSK-modulated pulses. The parallel inverter banks permit digital pulse-shaping, resulting in on-chip FCC-compliant operation, as Figure 2 shows.

Following, global navigation satellite systems reflected (GNSS-R) signals are used to demonstrate the results of <b>non-coherent</b> <b>signal</b> averaging on the mean and standard deviation of the signal power fluctuations. The retrieved signal fading statistics of GNSS-R signals detected in low Earth orbit have been analyzed as a function of consecutive uncorrelated measurements (or looks) and instrument antenna gain and compared to the theoretical description presented by Ulaby, Moore and Fung for a radar remote sensing configuration. The results of this analysis include empirically determined error distributions that provide a reference to asses the potential accuracy of GNSS-R model based retrieval methods, and to what extent increasing the instrument antenna gain will improve the retrieval accuracy. Additionally, in assessing the potential of using GNSS-R signals for ocean remote sensing, it is useful to compare the signal characteristics with those of existing radar altimeter instruments. With this in mind, a fitting accuracy and parameter retrieval analysis has been undertaken using observed fading noise from successful space based altimeters. The noise observed on real waveforms has been added to a simulated ideal waveform with the intent to study the accuracy of ocean observables using a Monte Carlo simulation. By adding observed noise to ideal model waveforms in this way, it is possible to quantitatively asses the fitting errors with respect to noise variance contained in the least-squares model fitting sensing technique.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years there has been an {{extensive}} growth in data traffic consumption devices. Billions of mobile data devices are connected to the global wireless network. Customers demand revived services and up-to-date developed applications, like real-time video and games. These applications require reliable and high data rate wireless communication with high throughput network. One way to meet these requirements is by increasing the number of transmit and/or receive antennas of the wireless communication systems. Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has emerged as a promising candidate technology for the next generation (5 G) wireless communication. Massive MIMO increases the spatial multiplexing gain and the data rate by adding an excessive number of antennas to the base station (BS) terminals of wireless communication systems. However, building efficient algorithms able to decode a coherently or non-coherently large flow of transmitted signal with low complexity is a big challenge in massive MIMO. In this dissertation, we propose novel approaches to achieve optimal performance for joint channel estimation and signal detection for massive MIMO systems. The dissertation consists of three parts depending on the number of users at the receiver side. In the first part, we introduce a probabilistic approach {{to solve the problem of}} coherent signal detection using the optimized Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. Two factors contribute to the speed of finding the optimal solution by the MCMC detector: The probability of encountering the optimal solution when the Markov chain converges to the stationary distribution, and the mixing time of the MCMC detector. First, we compute the optimal value of the “temperature 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 parameter such that the MC encounters the optimal solution in a polynomially small probability. Second, we study the mixing time of the underlying Markov chain of the proposed MCMC detector. We assume the channel state information is known in the first part of the dissertation; in the second part we consider <b>non-coherent</b> <b>signal</b> detection. We develop and design an optimal joint channel estimation and signal detection algorithms for massive (single-input multiple-output) SIMO wireless systems. We propose exact non-coherent data detection algorithms in the sense of generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). In addition to their optimality, these proposed tree based algorithms perform low expected complexity and for general modulus constellations. More specifically, despite the large number of the unknown channel coefficients for massive SIMO systems, we show that the expected computational complexity of these algorithms is linear in the number of receive antennas (N) and polynomial in channel coherence time (T). We prove that as N →∞, the number of tested hypotheses for each coherent block equals T times the cardinality of the modulus constellation. Simulation results show that the optimal non-coherent data detection algorithms achieve significant performance gains (up to 5 dB improvement in energy efficiency) with low computational complexity. In the part three, we consider massive MIMO uplink wireless systems with time-division duplex (TDD) operation. We propose an optimal algorithm in terms of GLRT to solve the problem of joint channel estimation and data detection for massive MIMO systems. We show that the expected complexity of our algorithm grows polynomially in the channel coherence time (T). The proposed algorithm is novel in two terms: First, the transmitted signal can be chosen from any modulus constellation, constant and non-constant. Second, the algorithm decodes the received noisy signal, which is transmitted a from multiple-antenna array, offering exact solution with polynomial complexity in the coherent block interval. Simulation results demonstrate significant performance gains of our approach compared with suboptimal non-coherent detection schemes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm which efficiently achieves GLRT-optimal non-coherent detections for massive MIMO systems with general constellations...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, space-time block codes {{originally}} developed for multiple antenna systems are extended to cooperative multi-hop networks. The designs are applicable to any wireless network setting especially cellular, adhoc and sensor networks where space limitations preclude {{the use of}} multiple antennas. The thesis first investigates the design of distributed orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal space time block codes in cooperative networks with single and multiple antennas at the destination. Numerical and simulation results show that by employing multiple receive antennas the diversity performance of the network is further improved at the expense of slight modification of the detection scheme. The thesis then focuses on designing distributed space time block codes for cooperative networks in which the source node participates in cooperation. Based on this, a source-assisting strategy is proposed for distributed orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal space time block codes. Numerical and simulation results show that the source-assisting strategy exhibits improved diversity performance compared to the conventional distributed orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal designs. Motivated by the problem of channel state information acquisition in practical wireless network environments, the design of differential distributed space time block codes is investigated. Specifically, a co-efficient vector-based differential encoding and decoding scheme is proposed for cooperative networks. The thesis then explores the concatenation of differential strategies with several distributed space time block coding schemes namely; the Alamouti code, square-real orthogonal codes, complex-orthogonal codes, and quasiorthogonal codes, using cooperative networks with different number of relay nodes. In order to cater for high data rate transmission in non-coherent cooperative networks, differential distributed quasi-orthogonal space-time block codes which are capable of achieving full code-rate and full diversity are proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the differential distributed quasi-orthogonal space-time block codes outperform existing distributed space time block coding schemes in terms of code rate and bit-error-rate performance. A multidifferential distributed quasi-orthogonal space-time block coding scheme is also proposed to exploit the additional diversity path provided by the source-destination link. A major challenge is how to construct full rate codes for non-coherent cooperative broadband networks with more than two relay nodes while exploiting the achievable spatial and frequency diversity. In this thesis, full rate quasi-orthogonal codes are designed for noncoherent cooperative broadband networks where channel state information is unavailable. From this, a generalized differential distributed quasi-orthogonal space-frequency coding scheme is proposed for cooperative broadband networks. The proposed scheme is able to achieve full rate and full spatial and frequency diversity in cooperative networks with any number of relays. Through pairwise error probability analysis we show that the diversity gain of the proposed scheme can be improved by appropriate code construction and sub-carrier allocation. Based on this, sufficient conditions are derived for the proposed code structure at the source node and relay nodes to achieve full spatial and frequency diversity. In order to exploit the additional diversity paths provided by the source-destination link, a novel multidifferential distributed quasi-orthogonal space-frequency coding scheme is proposed. The overall objective of the new scheme is {{to improve the quality of}} the detected signal at the destination with negligible increase in the computational complexity of the detector. Finally, a differential distributed quasi-orthogonal space-time-frequency coding scheme is proposed to cater for high data rate transmission and improve the performance of noncoherent cooperative broadband networks operating in highly mobile environments. The approach is to integrate the concept of distributed space-time-frequency coding with differential modulation, and employ rotated constellation quasi-orthogonal codes. From this, we design a scheme which is able to address the problem of performance degradation in highly selective fading environments while guaranteeing <b>non-coherent</b> <b>signal</b> recovery and full code rate in cooperative broadband networks. The coding scheme employed in this thesis relaxes the assumption of constant channel variation in the temporal and frequency dimensions over long symbol periods, thus performance degradation is reduced in frequencyselective and time-selective fading environments.

In these systems, Grassmannian sig-nalling, originally developed for single-channel block-fading sys-tems, is not readily applicable.

To approach this goal, we de-velop a concatenation technique that yields a spectrally-efficient time-frequency Grassmannian signalling scheme, which enables the channel coherence bandwidth {{to be regarded as}} an additional coherence time.

The studied receivers are based on both coherent and <b>non-coherent</b> detections. The <b>signal</b> structure is following the IEEE 802. 15. 4 a standard and the channel models used in the simulations are based on the experimental studies carried out at a real hospital environment. Two different links are used; on-body link and a link from body to external access point.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedFrequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar {{is a type}} of Low Probability of Intercept radar system that is being heavily investigated in the military. Not only is its transmission difficult to be detected by enemy intercept receivers, but FMCW radar has the inherent capability of increasing coherent signal power while suppressing noise power during its receive signal processing. This thesis investigates the jamming effectiveness of selected jamming waveforms by injecting the interfering signals into the Lab-Volt Radar Training System (LVRTS). The jamming effect is evaluated based on the change in beat frequency due to the jamming. Due to the hardware limitations of the LVRTS, a MATLAB simulation model is also constructed for advanced electronic attack testing. The MATLAB model emulates the FMCW emitter digital signal processing response to coherent and <b>non-coherent</b> jamming <b>signals</b> under an anti-ship capable missile scenario. The simulation output is the target range and range rate, whose error measures quantify the jamming effectiveness. From the standpoint of electronic warfare, related subjects such as electronic warfare support measures and FMCW electronic protection are also discussed. Lieutenant, Taiwan Nav...|$|R
40|$|Our paper {{addresses}} the <b>non-coherent</b> synchronization (<b>signal</b> acquisition) {{in the presence}} of asynchronous concurrent transmissions with heterogeneous power levels. This occurs for example {{in the presence of}} multiple interfering piconets, or in purely ad-hoc networks. Our contributions are (1) problem identification, (2) a new detection method and (3) performance evaluation. 1. 1 Problem Identification We explain the problem that arises using the conventional detection method, which correlates the received UWB Impulse Radio (IR) signal with a Template Pulse Train (TPT) and performs a threshold check on the output of the correlation; we show that the synchronization is either unfeasible or entails an extremely large overhead due to the Inter-User Interference (IUI) in the predescribed scenarios. 1. 2 A New Detection Method We propose a new detection method, which we call Power Independent Detection (PID) method, in order to solve the extreme IUI case (near-far problem). To this end, the PID method splits the correlation into elementary correlations. Each one corresponds to one pulse in the TPT. Then, two threshold checks are performed. The first is to detect pulses whereas the second is to detect the signal {{based on the number of}} detected pulses. Our PID method solves the problem without any additional complexity overhead, e. g. for a digital receiver, it employs the same sampling frequency and number o...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} ergodic {{capacity}} of multipath channels in the wideband regime with limited feedback. Our work builds on recent results that have established significant capacity gains achievable in the wideband/low-SNR regime, {{when there is}} perfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. Furthermore, this benchmark gain can be obtained with just 1 -bit of CSI at the transmitter about each channel coefficient. However, the capacity achieving signals are peaky; they have large instantaneous transmit power, especially in the <b>non-coherent</b> scenario. <b>Signal</b> peakiness is related to channel coherence and, {{in contrast to the}} prevalent assumption of rich multipath, we investigate the capacity of sparse multipath channels, motivated by recent experimental results. Sparsity naturally leads to coherence in time and frequency. With perfect receiver CSI, it is shown that limited feedback, even with an instantaneous power constraint, is sufficient to achieve the benchmark capacity. Our analysis reveals the benefits of channel sparsity in the non-coherent scenario, where we employ a training-based communication scheme. With an average power constraint, it is shown that the benchmark is achievable, provided the channel coherence scales at a sufficiently fast rate with signal space dimension. Furthermore, in contrast to peaky signaling schemes that violate instantaneous power constraints, we show that the benchmark is attainable in sparse channels with finite instantaneous transmit power. We present rules of thumb on choosing the signaling parameters {{as a function of the}} channel parameters so that the full benefits of sparsity can be realized...|$|R
40|$|Applications like sensor networks, medical monitoring, and asset {{tracking}} {{have led to}} a demand for energy-efficient and low-cost wireless transceivers. These types of applications typically require low effective data rates, thus providing an opportunity to employ simple modulation schemes and aggressive duty-cycling. Due to their inherently duty-cycled nature, pulse-based Ultra-Wideband (UWB) systems are amenable to low-power operation by shutting off circuitry during idle mode between pulses. Furthermore, the use of <b>non-coherent</b> UWB <b>signaling</b> greatly simplifies both transmitter and receiver implementations, offering additional energy savings. This thesis presents an all-digital transmitter designed for a non-coherent pulsed UWB system. By exploiting relaxed center frequency tolerances in non-coherent wideband communication, the transmitter synthesizes UWB pulses from an energy efficient, single-ended digital ring oscillator. Dual capacitively-coupled digital power amplifiers (PAs) are used in tandem to generate bipolar phase modulated pulses for spectral scrambling purposes. By maintaining opposite common modes at the output of these PAs during idle mode (i. e. when no pulses are being transmitted), low frequency turn-on and turn-off transients typically associated with single-ended digital circuits driving single-ended antennas are attenuated by up to 12 dB. Furthermore, four level digital pulse shaping is employed to attenuate RF side lobes by up to 20 dB. The resulting dual power amplifiers achieve FCC compliant operation in the 3. 5, 4. 0, and 4. 5 GHz IEEE 802. 15. 4 a bands without the use of any off-chip filters or large passive components. The transmitter is fabricated in a 90 nm CMOS process and requires a core area of 0. 07 mm 2. The entirely digital architecture consumes zero static bias current, resulting in an energy efficiency of 17. 5 pJ/pulse at data rates up to 15. 6 Mbps. by Patrick Philip Mercier. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Future {{wireless}} network may {{consist of a}} cluster of low-complexity battery-powered nodes or mobile stations (MS). Information is propagated from one location in the network to another by cooperation and relaying. Due to the channel fading or node failure, one or more relaying links could become unreliable during multiple-hop relaying. Inspired by conventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques exploiting multiple co-located transmit antennas to introduce temporal and spatial diversity, the error performance and robustness against channel fading of a multiple-hop cooperative network could be significantly improved by creating a virtual antenna array (VAA) with various distributed MIMO techniques. In this thesis, we concentrate on the low-complexity distributed MIMO designed for both coherent and <b>non-coherent</b> diversity <b>signal</b> reception at the destination node. Further improvement on the network throughput as well as spectral efficiency could be achieved by extending the concept of unidirectional relaying to bidirectional cooperative communication. Physical-layer network coding (PLNC) assisted distributed space-time block coding (STBC) scheme as well as non-coherent PLNC aided distributed differential STBC system are proposed. It is confirmed by the theoretical analysis that both approaches {{have the potential for}} offering full spatial diversity gain. Furthermore, differential encoding and non-coherent detection techniques are generally associated with performance degradation due to the doubled noise variance. More importantly, conventional differential schemes suffer from the incapability of recovering the source information in time-varying channels owing to the assumption of static channel model used in the derivation of non-coherent detection algorithm. Several low-complexity solutions are proposed and studied in this thesis, which are able to compensate the performance loss caused by non-coherent detection and guarantee the reliable recovery of information in applications with high mobility. A substantial amount of iteration gain is achieved by combining the differential encoding with error-correction code and sufficient interleaving, which allows iterative possessing at the receiver...|$|R
40|$|High {{sensitivity}} detection {{techniques are}} required for indoor navigation using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, and typically, a combination of coherent and non- coherent integration is used as the test statistic for detection. The coherent integration exploits the deterministic part of the signal and is limited due to the residual frequency error, navigation data bits and user dynamics, which are not known apriori. So, non- coherent integration, which involves squaring of the coherent integration output, is used to improve the detection sensitivity. Due to this squaring, it is robust against the artifacts introduced due to data bits and/or frequency error. However, it is susceptible to uncertainty in the noise variance, and {{this can lead to}} fundamental sensitivity limits in detecting weak signals. In this work, the performance of the conventional <b>non-coherent</b> integration-based GNSS <b>signal</b> detection is studied in the presence of noise uncertainty. It is shown that the performance of {{the current state of the}} art GNSS receivers is close to the theoretical SNR limit for reliable detection at moderate levels of noise uncertainty. Alternate robust post-coherent detectors are also analyzed, and are shown to alleviate the noise uncertainty problem. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to confirm the theoretical predictions...|$|R
40|$|We present time-resolved {{spectroscopy}} and photometry of {{the bright}} cataclysmic variable LS Peg (= S 193). The Balmer lines exhibit broad, asymmetric wings Doppler-shifted by about 2000 km/s at the edges, while the HeI lines show phase-dependent absorption features strikingly similar to SW Sextantis stars, as well as emission {{through most of the}} phase. The CIII/NIII emission blend does not show any phase dependence. From velocities of Halpha emission lines, we determine an orbital period of 0. 174774 +/- 0. 000003 d (= 4. 1946 h), which agrees with Szkody's (1995) value of approximately 4. 2 hours. No stable photometric signal was found at the orbital period. A <b>non-coherent</b> quasi-periodic photometric <b>signal</b> was seen at a period of 20. 7 +/- 0. 3 min. The high-velocity Balmer wings most probably arise from a stream re-impact point close to the white dwarf. We present simulated spectra based on a kinematic model similar to the modified disk-overflow scenario of Hellier & Robinson (1994). The models reproduce the broad line wings, though some other details are unexplained. Using an estimate of dynamical phase based on the model, we show that the phasing of the emission- and absorption-line variations is consistent with that in (eclipsing) SW Sex stars. We therefore identify LS Peg as a low-inclination SW Sex star. Our model suggests i = 30 deg, and the observed absence of any photometric signal at the orbital frequency establishes i < 60 deg. This constraint puts a severe strain on interpretations of the SW Sex phenomenon which rely on disk structures lying slightly out of the orbital plane.
