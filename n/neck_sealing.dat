40|$|The noninvasive {{measurement}} of infant lung function during unsedated sleep in infants {{has been a}} long-standing objective in paediatric respiratory medicine. This note reports on the design and performance of a head-out volume-displacement plethysmograph (VDP) that overcomes some {{of the limitations of}} traditional lung function apparatus. The VDP comprises a rigid acrylic box with an integral water-sealed spirometer and a novel <b>neck</b> <b>seal.</b> The bilayer <b>neck</b> <b>seal</b> is of variable compliance and is comfortable and simple to use. The spirometer permits volume resolution of 1. 5 mL and a dynamic range in excess of 100 mL. The frequency response extends from 0 - 7 Hz. Spirometer inertance was measured as 0. 0015 kPa·L·s, resistance 0. 021 kPa·L·s and box capacitance 0. 18 L·kPa. Tidal volume, respiratory rate and changes in functional residual capacity can be recorded during unsedated rapid eye movement and nonrapid eye movement whilst monitoring with conventional polysomnographic methods. The head-out configuration allows additional instrumentation to be implemented with ease, avoids facial stimulation and allows unimpeded access to the upper airway. A polysomnograph illustrating the limitations of respiratory inductance plethysmography signals and typical changes in functional residual capacity are shown...|$|R

40|$|A {{document}} {{discusses the}} design and prototype of an advanced spacesuit concept that integrates the capability to function seamlessly with multiple ventilation system approaches. Traditionally, spacesuits are designed to operate both dependently and independently of a host vehicle environment control and life support system (ECLSS). Spacesuits that operate independent of vehicle-provided ECLSS services must do so with equipment selfcontained within or on the spacesuit. Suits that are dependent on vehicle-provided consumables must remain physically connected to and integrated with the vehicle to operate properly. This innovation is {{the design and}} prototype of a hybrid spacesuit approach that configures the spacesuit to seamlessly interface and integrate with either type of vehicular systems, while still maintaining the ability to function completely independent of the vehicle. An existing Advanced Crew Escape Suit (ACES) was utilized as the platform from which to develop the innovation. The ACES was retrofitted with selected components and one-off items to achieve the objective. The ventilation system concept was developed and prototyped/retrofitted to an existing ACES. Components were selected to provide suit connectors, hoses/umbilicals, internal breathing system ducting/ conduits, etc. The concept utilizes a lowpressure- drop, high-flow ventilation system {{that serves as a}} conduit from the vehicle supply into the suit, up through a <b>neck</b> <b>seal,</b> into the breathing helmet cavity, back down through the <b>neck</b> <b>seal,</b> out of the suit, and returned to the vehicle. The concept also utilizes a modified demand-based breathing system configured to function seamlessly with the low-pressure-drop closed-loop ventilation system...|$|R
50|$|The {{exhaust valve}} lets the diver vent {{expanding}} {{gas from the}} suit during the ascent. On ascent {{the air in the}} suit expands making buoyancy control difficult or impossible. This may cause an uncontrolled ascent resulting in missed decompression stops, decompression sickness, arterial gas embolism or pulmonary barotrauma. The manual exhaust allows the diver to control the suit volume; this may incorporate an automatic, adjustable exhaust or there may be a separate automatic, auto dump, valve on the shoulder. Automatic valves can be set to release at a pre-set pressure and in most situations, the diver can leave the automatic valve at a constant setting throughout the dive so that it releases {{with a small amount of}} over-pressure venting as needed automatically as the diver ascends. There are many different configurations but automatic vents are generally at the left shoulder, and manual vents are at the wrist. Environmentally sealed suits used for diving in contaminated water have no dump valve, but are clamped to the helmet with a watertight seal, so the exhaust valve of the helmet functions as a dump valve. Some, now rare, older dry suits may have no vents, requiring the diver to lift one of the wrist <b>seals</b> or the <b>neck</b> <b>seal</b> open to vent the suit.Surface dry suits do not normally have exhaust valves, but the wearer may vent excess air by crouching down and hugging the legs while slipping a finger under the <b>neck</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{is a risk}} of {{aspiration}} of vomit {{trapped in}} the helmet air passages, with possibly fatal consequences. This problem is greatest in helmets and full-face masks with internal oro-nasal masks, where it will pass into the demand valve, and that which does not exit through the exhaust ports, will be an aspiration hazard unless flushed out before the next inhalation. A different problem occurs in free-flow helmets - there is less chance of aspiration, but vomit remains in the helmet or drains through into the diving suit, which is unpleasant, but not life-threatening. It {{may be possible to}} flush it out through the <b>neck</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|R
50|$|For a {{few years}} after C.E. Heinke & Co. Ltd. was taken over by Siebe-Gorman and Company in 1961, dry suits were marketed under the Siebe-Heinke label.

25|$|The helmet may be {{of metal}} or {{reinforced}} plastic composite (GRP), and is either connected to a neck dam or clamped directly to a drysuit. The neck dam is {{the lower part of}} the helmet, which <b>seals</b> against the <b>neck</b> of the diver in the same way that the <b>neck</b> <b>seal</b> of a dry suit works. Neck dams may have neoprene or latex seals, depending on diver preference.

50|$|Smoke hoods {{present on}} aircraft, also called {{protective}} breathing equipment (or PBEs), typically generate oxygen for anywhere from 30 seconds to 15 minutes. The oxygen {{is kept in}} a closed circuit, usually thanks to a tight <b>neck</b> <b>seal.</b> A scrubber system may be present to reduce the levels of carbon dioxide, and is breathable for around 20 minutes. When the oxygen supply ends, the hood will begin deflating and must be removed to avoid suffocation. These devices represent a subgroup of smoke hoods called positive-pressure respirators, which prevent the ingress of smoke or toxic gases by maintaining a higher air pressure inside the mask than outside. Consequently, any leak will cause fresh air to leak out of the mask, rather than toxic air to leak in.|$|R

50|$|The pneumofathometer hose has {{a smaller}} bore than the main {{breathing}} gas hose of the umbilical, {{but it is}} connected to the same gas supply at the gas panel, and {{can be used as a}} secondary route for surface supplied breathing gas for the diver if the main hose malfunctions. The open end of the pneumo hose can be inserted under the <b>neck</b> <b>seal</b> of the helmet or the face seal of a full-face mask, unless the helmet is sealed to the suit to prevent contamination by a hazardous environment. This is colloquially known as pneumo-breathing, and is a useful adjunct to the bailout set, as the gas supply is less limited. Pneumo-breathing may be used during the exit from a dive aborted after main gas hose failure as it allows the emergency gas supply to be conserved in case of a further failure.|$|R

25|$|Dressing into a {{dry suit}} is usually more {{time-consuming}} than a wet suit, and may require {{the assistance of}} another person to check the <b>neck</b> <b>seal</b> and close the zipper. In situations where the air is warm but the water cold, a prolonged time {{on the deck of}} a boat donning a dry suit and other gear can present a risk of overheating to the diver. This is a particular problem to relatively inexperienced divers, who may require more time to dress in. This problem can be mitigated by preparing all other equipment as far as possible before fully donning the suit and to wet the outside of the suit, and the hair and face after closing the zipper, to provide some evaporative cooling while on deck. Professional stand-by divers may have a similar problem, as they are required to be ready for deployment at all times while the working diver is in the water, which may involve waiting on deck for several hours. Wetting the outside of the suit, and seating the diver in shade and a breeze are the usual solution to this problem.|$|R
