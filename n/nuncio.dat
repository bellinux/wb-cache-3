5|$|After Gebhard's expulsion, Ernst assumed full {{charge of}} the Electorate of Cologne. In his later years, a <b>nuncio</b> at Cologne took {{responsibilities}} for the financial administration of the archdiocese, and Ernst's nephew, Ferdinand of Bavaria, {{was elected to the}} Cathedral Chapter, the Wittelsbach heir-apparent. When Ernst died in 1612, the Cathedral Chapter duly elected his nephew to the position and Wittelsbachs held the Electorate until 1761. Ernst's victory, both in winning the election in 1583, and in convincing the assembly of other electors to accept him in 1585, confirmed him as the new archbishop of Cologne and gave the Wittelsbach family a foothold on the northern Rhine.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{was made}} canon in the Chapter of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Warmia on 16 September 1581. The canons {{and the elderly}} bishop, Marcin Kromer, had been opposed to Andrew's appointment, but the new papal <b>nuncio,</b> Alberto Bolognetti, the {{chancellor}} of Poland, Jan Zamoyski, and Stephen Báthory persuaded one of the canons to abdicate in favor of Andrew. However, the canons, along with the Estates of Royal Prussia, prevented Andrew's promotion to coadjutor bishop {{saying that he was}} too young. At the nuncio's initiative, Andrew was elected provost of the Monastery of Miechów in spring 1583.|$|E
5|$|Andrew was the {{favorite}} nephew of Stephen Báthory who officially adopted him. Giovanni Andrea Caligari, the papal <b>nuncio</b> (or ambassador) in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, urged the king to persuade Andrew {{to start a}} church career. According to the Transylvanian historian, István Szamosközy, Andrew had already been fascinated by altars, churches and tombs as a child. However, his Protestant mother and relatives wanted to dissuade Andrew. After recovering from an almost lethal pneumonia in spring 1581, Andrew accepted their advice. He was especially worried about clerical celibacy, because it prevented him from fathering legitimate children. He also hoped that his uncle would promote his secular career. His Jesuit tutors finally persuaded him to accept his uncle's decision.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Hannegan {{makes an}} {{alliance}} with the kingdom of Laredo and the neighboring, relatively civilized city-states against the threat of attack from the nomadic warriors. Hannegan, however, is manipulating the regional politics to effectively neutralize all of his enemies, leaving him {{in control of the}} entire region. Monsignor Apollo, the papal <b>nuncio</b> to Hannegan's court, sends word to New Rome that Hannegan intends to attack the empire of Denver next, and that he intends to use the abbey as a base of operations from which to conduct the campaign. For his actions, Apollo is executed, and Hannegan initiates a church schism, declaring loyalty to the Pope to be punishable by death. The Church excommunicates Hannegan.|$|E
5|$|After Marcin Kromer died {{in early}} March 1589, Andrew became the Prince-Bishop of Warmia {{and a member}} of the Senate of Poland. He {{supported}} the introduction of the teaching of philosophy and theology in the Collegium Hosianum in Braniewo, because he wanted to develop it into a university. At the request of Sigismund III Vasa, Pope Sixtus made Andrew coadjutor bishop of Piotr Myszkowski, the elderly bishop of Kraków. However, the Habsburgs wanted to prevent Andrew from seizing the bishopric which was situated near Royal Hungary. The new papal <b>nuncio,</b> Annibale di Capua (who was their supporter) convinced the king to nominate Jerzy Radziwiłł to the see after Myszkowski died on 5 April 1591. Capua emphasized that Andrew had not been an ordained priest. Most Polish noblemen regarded the Lithuanian Radziwiłł's appointment to a Polish see unlawful, but Pope Gregory XIV confirmed the king's decision.|$|E
5|$|In August 1591, Maximilian of Habsburg, {{who still}} claimed Poland and Lithuania, sent his envoy to Andrew seeking Transylvanian support against Sigismund III. Andrew {{emphasized}} that being under Ottoman suzerainty, Transylvania could not openly support Maximilian, {{but he also}} promised that Sigismund Báthory would not prevent the mustering of Transylvanian soldiers to fight in Poland. In the same month, Sigismund Báthory's plan to enable the Jesuits to return to Transylvania {{gave rise to a}} serious family conflict, because both Andrew and Balthasar refused to support the prince at the Diet. According to contemporaneous gossips, Andrew and his two brothers decided to dethrone Sigismund, replacing him with Balthasar. Pope Clement VIII sent a papal <b>nuncio,</b> Attilio Amalteo, to Transylvania to mediate a reconciliation.|$|E

5|$|On 1 September 1939 Nazi Germany invaded Poland, {{starting}} World War II in Europe, {{and subsequently}} made Zaolzie {{part of the}} Military district of Upper Silesia. On 26 October 1939 Nazi Germany unilaterally annexed Zaolzie as part of Landkreis Teschen. During the war, strong Germanization was introduced by the authorities. The Jews were in the worst position, followed by the Poles. Poles received lower food rations, {{they were supposed to}} pay extra taxes, they were not allowed to enter theatres, cinemas, etc. Polish and Czech education ceased to exist, Polish organizations were dismantled and their activity was prohibited. Katowice's Bishop Adamski was deposed as apostolic administrator for the Catholic parishes in Zaolzie and on 23 December 1939 Cesare Orsenigo, <b>nuncio</b> to Germany, returned them to their original archdioceses of Breslau or Olomouc, respectively, with effect of 1 January 1940.|$|E
5|$|On 19March 1995, a Mass {{was celebrated}} in the {{reclaimed}} part of the church {{under the direction of}} Papal <b>Nuncio</b> John Bukowski, who delivered Pope John PaulII's blessing to the parish. In a new decision dated 2November 1995, Luzhkov ordered Mosspetspromproyekt to leave the building {{by the end of the}} year at the latest. When the order was still not implemented, parish members entered the institute on 2January 1996 and began the removal. Institute director Evgeny Afanasyev called the police once again, but on this occasion, they declined to intervene. Subsequently, the institute director asked the parish priest for a final extension of the removal date by two weeks—Mosspetspromproyekt vacated the building on 13January 1996. On 2February 1996, the Archdiocese of Mother of God at Moscow obtained official permission to use the church indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|The Polish side {{argued that}} Poles in Zaolzie {{deserved}} the same ethnic rights and freedom as the Sudeten Germans under the Munich Agreement. The {{vast majority of}} the local Polish population enthusiastically welcomed the change, seeing it as a liberation and a form of historical justice, but they quickly changed their mood. The new Polish authorities appointed people from Poland to various key positions from which locals were fired. The Polish language became the sole official language. Using Czech (or German) by Czechs (or Germans) in public was prohibited and Czechs and Germans were being forced to leave the annexed area or become subject to Polonization. Rapid Polonization policies then followed in all parts of public and private life. Czech organizations were dismantled and their activity was prohibited. The Roman Catholic parishes in the area belonged either to the Archdiocese of Breslau (Archbishop Bertram) or to the Archdiocese of Olomouc (Archbishop Leopold Prečan), respectively, both traditionally comprising cross-border diocesan territories in Czechoslovakia and Germany. When the Polish government demanded after its takeover that the parishes there be disentangled from these two archdioceses, the Holy See complied. Pope Pius XI, former <b>nuncio</b> to Poland, subjected the Catholic parishes in Zaolzie to an apostolic administration under Stanisław Adamski, Bishop of Katowice.|$|E

5|$|While Cranmer was {{following}} Charles through Italy, {{he received a}} royal letter dated 1 October 1532 informing {{him that he had}} been appointed the new Archbishop of Canterbury, following the death of archbishop William Warham. Cranmer was ordered to return to England. The appointment had been secured by the family of Anne Boleyn, who was being courted by Henry. When Cranmer's promotion became known in London, it caused great surprise as Cranmer had previously held only minor positions in the Church. Cranmer left Mantua on 19 November and arrived in England at the beginning of January. Henry personally financed the papal bulls necessary for Cranmer's promotion to Canterbury. The bulls were easily acquired because the papal <b>nuncio</b> was under orders from Rome to please the English in an effort to prevent a final breach. The bulls arrived around 26 March 1533 and Cranmer was consecrated as archbishop on 30 March in St Stephen's Chapel. Even while they were waiting for the bulls, Cranmer continued to work on the annulment proceedings, which required greater urgency after Anne announced her pregnancy. Henry and Anne were secretly married on 24 or 25 January 1533 {{in the presence of a}} handful of witnesses. Cranmer did not learn of the marriage until a fortnight later.|$|E
