40|$|Introduction: In Brazil, dentists have a legal, moral, {{and ethical}} {{obligation}} to <b>notify</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> of suspected cases of maltreatment. Studies conducted {{in several countries}} reported the difficulties of dentists in the diagnosis, documentation, and reporting of suspected abuse cases to authorities. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the perception, diagnosis and attitudes of Brazilian endodontists towards child abuse. Material and methods: Data were collected from 56 questionnaires, considering a total of 248 sent by mail (response rate = 23 %) to the endodontists (female = 73 %). Results: Forty-one percent (n = 23) of the professionals answered that they were able to identify cases of abuse, while 59 % (n = 33) answered that they were unable. Considering their graduation years, 93 % (n = 52) stated that they had received little information on this issue, and only 5 % (n = 3) attended seminars on this subject during the year before the questionnaire’s application. Although 61 % (n = 34) of the professionals affirmed that suspicious cases must be reported, only 30 % (n = 17) knew to whom. Eighteen percent (n = 10) of the endodontists reported they had already treated suspicious cases, although only 3. 5 % (n = 2) reported the case to the authorities. The most cited signs of abuse were: body bruises (48 %; n = 27), change in behavior (48 %; n = 27) and burn marks (12. 5 %; n = 7). Lesions presented in the face, mouth, and teeth were reported by 27 % (n = 15) of the professionals. There were no statistically differences regarding the number of notifications in relation to either the number of years since graduation or the workplace. Conclusion: It was concluded that it is necessary to improve endodontists’ formation concerning to child abuse identification, in order to modify their behavior, therefore, increasing the number of suspicious cases’ notifications...|$|R

40|$|During {{the early}} {{phase of a}} {{large-scale}} accident with release of radioactivity to the atmosphere, {{it is essential to}} <b>notify</b> and inform <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> as early and as extensive as possible. Only when the accident is rapidly notified and information is made available continuously in the form of real-time monitoring data and dispersion forecasts, decision makers are able to define appropriate countermeasures. The Chernobyl accident taught us that information exchange should be carried out in a harmonised and consistent manner. Although several European countries already had developed automatic monitoring networks in 1986 and in some cases established bilateral agreements to exchange this information, the size of the accident demonstrated the need to extend such schemes to the continental scale. It became important to have commonly agreed international data formats and procedures in place. Over the past 25 years, the European Commission has invested a lot in improving the rapid exchange of information and data {{in the event of a}} major accident. For the early phase of emergency support, it has focussed on three closely related systems: the early notification system ECURIE, the automatic data exchange platform EURDEP and the atmospheric dispersion model exchange and evaluation system ENSEMBLE. Starting from the legal background, we describe these information systems in detail with an emphasis on their current status and their planned future developments. JRC.

40|$|While {{products}} {{based on}} nanotechnology are actually reaching the market, sufficient knowledge on the associated toxicological risks is still lacking. Reducing {{the size of}} structures to nanolevel results in distinctly different properties. As well as the chemical composition, which largely dictates the intrinsic toxic properties, very small size {{appears to be a}} predominant indicator for toxic effects of particles. Based on these conclusions, the development of specific guidance documents at a European level for the safety evaluation of nanotechnology products applied in medical technology is strongly recommended and the need for further research in the field of nanotoxicology is clearly identified. For medical applications, immobilized nanostructures inside or on surfaces of medical devices such as surgical implants are expected to pose a minimal risk as long as they remain fixed. Release due to continuous chemical processes and/or mechanical stress at the interface of implants and surrounding tissues might yield potential risks, however. For medical applications utilising free nanoparticles or nanostructures, for example novel drug delivery systems, the specific toxicological properties have to be investigated. It is insufficient to rely on knowledge of the classical toxicity testing of chemical(s) and materials when the risks of nanoparticles and/or nanostructures have to be assessed. From a regulatory point of view, a risk management strategy is already a requirement for all medical technology applications. With regard to applications utilizing nanotechnology this is considered sufficient, as long as manufacturers, <b>notified</b> bodies and <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> are made aware of the need to carry out a dedicated (nano) toxicological risk assessment...|$|R
