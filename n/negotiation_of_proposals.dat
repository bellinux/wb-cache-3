The report was approved in 2012 and established the bases for what should be the proposal for the Horizon 2020 programme on the European financing of research and innovation for the period 2014-2020. Besides the proposal to reinforce the funds and of a better geographical distribution of the funds, the approved proposal also included a significant increase of support to the scientific work and to the attribution of scholarships within the European financing framework. Later, would also be part of the team of six rapporteurs, nominated by the European Parliament, to the definition and <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>proposal</b> about the Horizon 2020, being responsible for one of the legislative regulations on the Strategic Agenda for Innovation.

40|$|This {{technical}} note {{is the third}} in an SEI series on the adoption of lean and agile methods in the DoD. Agile topics in acquisition were introduced in CMU/SEI- 2010 -TN- 002 and CMU/SEI- 2011 -TN- 002. This {{technical note}} extends the topics covered into the evaluation and <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> technical <b>proposals</b> that reflect iterative development approaches that in turn leverage agile methods. This framework is intended for use by government program office personnel who seek to understand evaluation approaches in this context. The information and recommendations contained in this report result from observations of defense acquisition programs wherein contractors employed iterative methods such as Agile software development methodology (hereafter referred to as “agile”). Key questions for discussion with the contractor are provided, along with agile perspectives on why certain items will be defined differently {{depending on whether the}} contractor is using agile or iterative methods for software development. The intended audience for this paper includes any government personnel who need to support or participate in negotiations with contractors for changes to the contract that is in place to develop software using agile or iterative methods...|$|R

The author strives how Europeanization {{has affected the}} Danish government; parliament and political parties and what were the main changes as a result. Europeanization is defined from the EU point of you as the top-down process. It {{is also important to}} focus on intervening factors, which form the previously described changes. The Danish government {{is one of the most}} important actors in creating the Danish position. During the integration process the government has to adopt different strategies for the <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> European <b>proposals,</b> which was caused by a change in the decision-making process in the Coucil. Specificity of the Danish coordination system is characterized by the set up of the European Affairs Committee, which strengthens the power of the Danish parliament. The Europeanization of Danish political parties can be shown in the changes in their attitudes towards the EU. The Danish case is very particular because of European referenda that have to be announced when Danish sovereignty is transformed to the EU level. Europeanization is an unfinished process because of continual deepening and widening of the integration [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of public acceptance of CCS has been highlighted by developers and policy makers, with all emphasising {{that it is}} a fundamental factor in the future success of CCS. However, little research has been done so far on NGO positioning on CCS. The current debate in Europe, with discussion beginning to result in both real projects on the ground and in real policies, has put NGOs more and more into a position of making open stands. This has resulted in a diversity of viewpoints, and the controv ersy has polarized opinions. In this paper we review our own research on NGO opinions on CCS, to spell out their most important concerns. We discuss NGO positioning vis-à-vis the ongoing <b>negotiations</b> <b>of</b> a legislative <b>proposal</b> to regulate CCS in Europe. Finally, we consider whether it is possible to come to more coherent approaches and agreements in a way that maximizes their effectiveness both as a counterweight to, and partner of, other stakeholders and governments...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{increasing}} interest in the specification, generation and exchange of business ob-jects {{in the context of}} electronic commerce. Common business objects have been defined for product catalogs, purchase orders and other business entities. However, no business objects have been defined and implemented for supporting automated business negotiations even though business negotiation is very much an integral part of business activities. In this work, we have designed and implemented a set <b>of</b> business <b>negotiation</b> objects for supporting the bargaining type <b>of</b> business <b>negotiations.</b> These objects define the operations and information contents needed for negotiation parties to express their requirements and constraints during a bargaining proc-ess. They correspond to a set <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> primitives, which is a superset of the negotiation-related primitives defined in two popular languages: ACL and COOL. The implementation of these objects is patterned after the business object documents in the XML format proposed by the Open Applications Group, thus conforming to the established standard. The incorporation of several types of constraint specifications in these business nego-tiation objects provides the negotiation parties and the negotiation servers that represent them much expressive power in specifying call-for-proposals and proposals. Two synchronization problems and their solutions associ-ated with the withdrawal and modification <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>proposals</b> are addressed and presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} belief that the agents' {{cognitive}} structures {{play a central role}} on the enhancement of predicative capacities of decision-making strategies. This paper analyses and simulates the construction of cognitive social structures in the process of decision making with multiple actors. In this process it is argued that the agent's rational choices may be assessed by its motivations, according to different patterns of social interactions. We first construct an abstract model of social dependence between agents, and define a set of social structures that are easily identifiable according to potential interactions. We then carry out a set of experiments at micro-social levels of analysis, where the agents' cognitive structures are explicitly represented. These experiments indicate that different social dependence structures imply distinct structural patterns <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>proposals,</b> which appear to have diverse patterns of complexity in the search space. It is subsequently shown that this observation emerges as an issue of ambiguity in the regulation of different decision-making criteria, relative to motivation-oriented and utility-oriented choices. In the scope of this ambiguity, we finally make some conjectures relative to further analytical and empirical analysis around the relation between patterns of complexity of social structures and decision-making...|$|R

In this paper we propose a new protocol, the authorization exchange protocol (AXP), that provides a modular and extensible solution to this problem. It is situated between the application and the network layers acting as an authorization middleware component and handles the process of transmitting and receiving service access requests and replies, along with the credentials that are required to support them. In order to allow its use in securing delay sensitive applications, AXP has been designed to work over unreliable datagram transport protocols.

The <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> form consists of at least four interactional moves that encourage peer- and self-repair and aim to draw attention to non-target output. Unlike the <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> form, recasts - the most widely used type of corrective feedback - are unable to lead to peer- or self-repair. Moreover, they risk being perceived ambiguously by classroom learners because their discourse functions resemble those of noncorrective repetition and because they are often accompanied by signs of approval.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} verbal student–teacher interactions in vocational education from a socio-cultural perspective on <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning. Teaching {{as part of}} these interactions is addressed {{by a combination of}} diagnosing, checking and intervening strategies. A study was conducted in which students (n students[*]=[*] 20) and teacher (n teachers[*]=[*] 5) from Social Work (SW) and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) worked together in small groups (n groups[*]=[*] 5) discussing vocational core problems. Each group held five discussions (n discussions[*]=[*] 25). All discussions were audio recorded and transcribed before they were analysed for <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning including teaching strategies. The results showed that 5 – 8 % of the interactions include <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning. Interactions in SW groups revealed more <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning than in interactions in ICT groups. Teaching strategies mainly included checking and intervening activities in favour of diagnosing activities. Furthermore, teachers used meta-cognitive and conceptual interventions most frequently. The implications of these results are discussed by reflecting on occupational differences and on how <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning including teaching strategies can be enhanced...|$|R

40|$|This {{empirical}} {{study investigated}} the occurrence <b>of</b> meaning <b>negotiation</b> in an interactive synchronous computer-mediated second language (L 2) environment. Sixteen dyads (N = 32) consisting of nonnative speakers (NNSs) and native speakers (NSs) of English performed 2 different tasks using videoconferencing and written chat. The data were coded and analyzed both for instances <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning and for instances where the NNSs did not initiate repair despite nonunderstanding. Absences <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning are generally excluded from detailed analysis primarily because {{it is difficult to}} establish nonunderstanding unless the participant overtly indicates it. In order to assess the effect of the nonoccurrence <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning on task performance and task completion, this study used 2 tasks: a culturally specific task that almost certainly would result in NNS nonunderstanding and a collaborative decision-making task that should trigger instances <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning. It was found that, in both tasks, instead of initiating repair sequences, NNS participants frequently did not engage in <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning despite nonunderstanding. We conclude that disregarding nonoccurrence <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning in (digital) task-based language teaching may lead to misrepresenting task performance, task outcome, and task evaluation, and, beyond that, to disregarding evidence that has both empirical and theoretical consequences for the Interaction Hypothesis and, by implication, for second language acquisition...|$|R
