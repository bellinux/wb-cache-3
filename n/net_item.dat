The literature generally criticizes MR Page as a measure that does not adequately capture disclosure quality (Beretta and Bozzolan 2008). With respect to BAR Net, the measurement method underlying this score is not stable over time, as items are changed, added or eliminated. Additionally, the BAR <b>Net</b> <b>items</b> not only cover information content in the annual report, but also the way information is presented, e.g., with graphical and other layout techniques.

Supplier {{selection is}} a multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem that is affected by several conflicting factors. Depending on the purchasing situations, criteria have varying importance and there is a need to weight criteria. In practice, for supplier selection problems, most of the input information is not known precisely. In these cases, the theory of fuzzy sets {{is one of the}} best tools for handling uncertainty. The fuzzy multiobjective model is formulated in such a way as to simultaneously consider the imprecision of information and determine the order quantities to each supplier based on price breaks.

Methodology/methods: First we outline the principal theories of the statement of comprehensive income, secondly we concentrate the research to obtain the empirical data.

5000|$|Constant {{purchasing}} power accounting is an accounting model {{approved by the}} International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) {{as an alternative to}} traditional historical cost accounting under hyper-inflationary environments.) Under this system, financial capital maintenance is measured in units of constant {{purchasing power}} (CPP) in terms of a Daily CPI (consumer price index) during low inflation and deflation. It can also be measured in a monetized daily indexed unit of account (e.g. the Unidad de Fomento in Chile) and in terms of a daily relatively stable foreign currency parallel rate or daily index during high inflation and hyperinflation. The stable measuring unit assumption is never implemented under CMUCPP. CMUCPP implements financial CMUCPP - as originally authorized in IFRS in the Framework (1989), Par 104 (a) Conceptual Framework (2010), Par 4.59 (a) which states: [...] "Financial capital maintenance can be measured in either nominal monetary units or units of CPP" [...] {{as an alternative to the}} 3000-year-old generally accepted globally implemented traditional historical cost accounting (HCA) model - with differentiated variable and constant real value non-monetary items in terms of a Daily CPI which automatically maintains the real value of capital constant for an indefinite period of time in all entities that at least break even in real value at all levels of inflation and deflation - ceteris paribus. <b>Net</b> constant <b>item</b> losses and gains are calculated and accounted whenever constant items are not measured in units of CPP.

40|$|Upon Austria's {{entry into}} Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB) took on new tasks {{in the field}} of payment systems. January 4, 1999, marked the launch of the {{cross-border}} real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system TARGET. This system, in which EU-wide some 5, 000 credit institutions participate, is composed of the national RTGS payment systems operated in the EU countries, the ECB Payment Mechanism (EPM) and an interface component called Interlinking. Austria's RTGS system, ARTIS, is integrated into TARGET. TARGET was designed as a real-time system, i. e., in normal circumstances payments reach their destination within a few seconds or minutes after being debited from the account of the sending participants, with all payments treated equally, irrespective of their value and destination. As a gross settlement system, TARGET guarantees intraday finality of payments, since transactions are settled individually. Throughout a business day, TARGET enables participating credit institutions to flexibly manage their liquidity, as they may use their minimum reserves for settlement purposes during the day. Banks may obtain unlimited intraday credit free of charge by providing adequate collateral, namely tier-one and tier-two assets. Euro 1 set up by the Euro Banking Association (EBA), Euro Access Frankfurt (EAF) and the Paris Net Settlement (PNS) system, among others, provide key alternative channels for processing payments in euro. Compared with centralised systems, TARGET with its multitude of interfaces is more susceptible to technical incidents. Even though its fees are higher, the majority of euro-denominated payments are processed via TARGET. Starting with the January 1998 reporting period, the OeNB introduced a new balance-of-payments presentation scheme. Transactions associated with the settlement of TARGET payments are recorded under "Currency and deposits" of monetary authorities (liabilities side) under the other investment sub-account of the financial account. In the first half of 1999, such transactions ran to ATS 66. 4 billion <b>net.</b> This <b>item</b> may not, however, be explained as an opposite position of the structural current account deficit of Austria vis-à-vis the EU 15, since TARGET transactions fall predominantly under the interbank category. The capital imported via central bank payment traffic is tantamount to borrowing by the "Austrian economy" that is basically financed at most favourable (tender rate) conditions.
