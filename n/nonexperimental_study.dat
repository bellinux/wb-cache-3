40|$|There is {{evidence}} from <b>nonexperimental</b> <b>studies</b> that group norms may influence both lethal and non–lethal self–aggressive behaviors. <b>Nonexperimental</b> <b>studies,</b> however, provide little information about potential cause–and–effect relation-ships. Accordingly, we experimentally examined whether self–aggressive group norms influence self–aggressive intent and behavior. Participants (N = 107) were exposed either to high–, low–, or mixed–self–aggressive group normative informa-tion, or were provided no normative information. After group norms were estab-lished, the participant stated {{his or her}} own self–aggressive intentions, and then completed a laboratory task designed to assess self–aggressive behavior. Results support the notion that group norms play a strong role in the expression of self–ag-gressive behavior. Clinical implications and the limitations of laboratory studies of self–aggression are discussed. Classic theories and research in social psychology have focused {{a great deal of attention}} on the formation and acquisition of reference group norms (Newcomb, 1943; Newcomb & Wilson, 1966; Sherif, 1936, 1972).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Although {{federal law}} {{requires}} all {{public schools to}} be smoke free, lack of compliance with the smoke-free policy is commonly reported. The aims {{of this study were}} to describe the indoor fine-particle (PM 2. 5) air pollution in a rural high school and surrounding public venues. This cross-sectional, <b>nonexperimental</b> <b>study</b> was conducted in Monroe County, Kentucky (popu-lation of 11, 756). Fine-particle concentrations were measured in the high school and 5 public venues using spectrometers. Because of illegal student smoking, PM 2. 5 concentrations were 19 times higher in the boys ’ student restroom than the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for outdoor air (670 vs. 35 g/m 3). The staff restrooms adjacent to the student restroom where staff did not smoke also showed high PM 2. 5 levels. Average indoor air pollution in the public venues was 158 g/m 3. Strict enforcement of smoke-free school policy and cessation resources are needed to reduce secondhand smoke exposure. Collaborative school-community campaigns involving parents, students, mass media, and community organizations may be effective in reducing the harm caused by tobacco. Implications for school nurses are discussed. KEY WORDS: fine particle exposure enforcement, school, secondhand smoke, smoke-free polic...|$|E
40|$|Threat {{assessment}} {{has been}} widely recommended as a violence prevention approach for schools, but there are few empirical studies of its use. This <b>nonexperimental</b> <b>study</b> of 280 Virginia public high schools compared 95 high schools using the Virginia threat assessment guidelines (Cornell & Sheras, 2006), 131 following other (i. e., locally developed) threat assessment procedures, and 54 not using a threat assessment approach. A survey of 9 th grade students in each school obtained measures of student victimization, willingness to seek help for bullying and threats of violence, and perceptions of the school climate as caring and supportive. Students in schools using the Virginia threat assessment guidelines reported less bullying, greater willingness to seek help, and more positive perceptions of the school climate than students in either of the other 2 groups of schools. In addition, schools using the Virginia guidelines had fewer long-term suspensions than schools using other threat assessment approaches. These group differences could not be attributed to school size, minority composition or socioeconomic status of the student body, neighborhood violent crime, or the extent of security measures in the schools.

By incorporating the biopsychosocial model and feminist theory as the theoretical frameworks for this research, PPD was conceptualized as a serious, multidimensional psychological condition. Using logistic regression, many predictors were identified as etiological for PPD, including subjective attitudes about ideal and introjected characteristics ascribed to women as primary caretakers. These beliefs prevent the extension and acceptance of social support from others, as well as the internalization of negative self-images. Furthermore, it was conceptualized that hormonal influences and lifestyle are risk factors that significantly affect the expression of PPD. According to study results, financial stressors and emotional stressors from a dissatisfaction of parenting were the strongest predictors of PPD among mothers. This study provides an important contribution to the existing literature and enhanced social change initiatives by making public the effect of social supports, biology, and their intersection on emic PPD experiences and expectations using participant 2 ̆ 7 s life experiences.

The framework for the study was based in the concept of organizational control. Data analysis included hierarchical regression of a convenience sample of 374 survey responses from salespeople to analyze the direct and moderating relationships between perceived sales management control and salesperson performance. Data were collected using Fluid Surveys. Although significant positive effects were identified between outcome control, activity control, and capability control on salesperson performance, as well as a significant negative effect of task complexity on salesperson performance, no moderating effects were found. Because sales management behavior impacts salesperson satisfaction, retention, and performance, identifying the positive impact of activity, capability, and outcome control, and the negative impact of task complexity on salesperson performance provides sales managers with important guidance when considering the elements of an effective approach to sales management. Finally, providing managers with specific guidance regarding management approach has implications for positive social change within organizations by improving salesperson satisfaction with their jobs, their manager, and the organization for whom they work...|$|E

Guided by Tinto 2 ̆ 7 s work, which holds that students remain in school when they feel academically or socially connected to an institution, this study addressed the impact of social factors, academic factors, and small learning communities (SLCs) on graduation rates. The research study used archival data and bivariate logistic regression to analyze the data for Latino male participants (n = 208) at an urban southern California high school. Results indicated that grade-point average (GPA), the number of suspensions, and Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) may be significant factors associated with graduation rates of the Latino male students. Implications for social change include an increase in support for programs such as AVID, a greater number of tutoring and mentoring programs to help students increase their GPA, and school policies that address discipline without increasing the number of suspensions.

The objective of our study was to assess the effect of drug treatment of hypertension under circumstances of everyday medical practice on the incidence of stroke by using a prognostically comparable untreated reference group. Within two prospective, population-based cohort studies among 45, 000 men and women 20 years of age and older in the Netherlands, we selected a cohort of 2, 301 hypertensive subjects who either received drug treatment for hypertension (N = 1, 318) or were untreated for hypertension but were determined to be "candidates" for drug treatment {{on the basis of their}} level of blood pressure and the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors (N = 983). Follow-up averaged 4. 6 years and was complete for 91 % of the hypertensives. Compared with untreated hypertensive subjects who were "candidates" for drug treatment, subjects who received drug treatment for hypertension had, after adjustment for potential confounders, a 39 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) = 3 - 61 %] reduced risk of stroke. About 46 (95 % CI = 29 - 599) hypertensive patients need to be treated with antihypertensive drugs for 5 years to prevent one stroke in the general Dutch population.

METHODS: A cohort of 4, 198 workers (aged 42 +/- 10 years, range 16 - 76 years, 27 % women) were analyzed at 3. 7 -year interval and stratified by each CVRF risk category (low/medium/high blood pressure [BP], total cholesterol [TC], body mass index [BMI], and smoking) with RTM and secular trend adjustments. Intervention consisted of 15 min CVRF screening and individualized counseling by health professionals to medium- and high-risk individuals, with eventual physician referral. RESULTS: High-risk groups participants improved diastolic BP (- 3. 4 mm Hg [95 %CI: - 5. 1, - 1. 7]) in 190 hypertensive patients, TC (- 0. 58 mmol/l [- 0. 71, - 0. 44]) in 693 hypercholesterolemic patients, and smoking (- 3. 1 cig/day [- 3. 9, - 2. 3]) in 808 smokers, while systolic BP changes reflected RTM. Low-risk individuals without counseling deteriorated TC and BMI. Body weight increased uniformly in all risk groups (+ 0. 35 kg/year). CONCLUSIONS: In real-world conditions, short intervention program participants in high-risk groups for diastolic BP, TC, and smoking improved their CVRF, whereas low-risk TC and BMI groups deteriorated.

Theoretical models predict the strength of interference at different prey densities for birds differing in dominance. Observational studies have been used to validate the theoretical predictions, but {{there is reason to believe}} that these <b>nonexperimental</b> <b>studies</b> suffer from confounding factors. We therefore manipulated forager density of oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus foraging on live cockles Cerastoderma edule (low density: 1 bird per 50 m 2 and high density: 2 birds per 50 m 2) in a unique experimental facility closely mimicking natural feeding conditions. In the high-density situation, the intake rate was on average reduced by 36 % compared with the interference-free intake rate. However, this effect depended on status with intake rate of subordinates being more strongly reduced than intake rate of dominants (- 45 % vs. - 25 %). We could not investigate all possible mechanisms, but we observed that birds actively avoided each other, possibly to avoid kleptoparasitism. Our experiment shows that the decline in intake rate with increasing density of conspecifics is at least partly due to direct interactions between birds and possibly also to indirect interactions via prey depression but not to an unidentified confounding factor that covaries with intake rate and bird density, as may have been the case in <b>nonexperimental</b> field <b>studies.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. According {{to common}} {{judicial}} standard, judgment {{in favor of}} plaintiff should be made {{if and only if}} it is “more probable than not ” that the defendant’s action was the cause for the plaintiff’s damage (or death). This paper provides formal semantics, based on structural models of counterfactuals, for the probability that event x was a necessary or sufficient cause (or both) of another event y. The paper then explicates conditions under which the probability of necessary (or sufficient) causation can be learned from statistical data, and shows how data from both experimental and <b>nonexperimental</b> <b>studies</b> can be combined to yield information that neither study alone can provide. Finally, we show that necessity and sufficiency are two independent aspects of causation, and that both should be invoked in the construction of causal explanations for specific scenarios. 1...|$|R
50|$|Galton's problem, {{named after}} Sir Francis Galton, {{is the problem}} of drawing inferences from {{cross-cultural}} data, due to the statistical phenomenon now called autocorrelation. The problem is now recognized as a general one that applies to all <b>nonexperimental</b> <b>studies</b> and to experimental design as well. It is most simply described as the problem of external dependencies in making statistical estimates when the elements sampled are not statistically independent.Asking two people in the same household whether they watch TV, for example, does not give you statistically independent answers. The sample size, n, for independent observations in this case is one, not two. Once proper adjustments are made that deal with external dependencies, then the axioms of probability theory concerning statistical independence will apply. These axioms are important for deriving measures of variance, for example, or tests of statistical significance.|$|R
