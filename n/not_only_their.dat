5|$|Frequent {{cyclones}} also pose a threat, {{particularly to}} concentrated or small populations. In late January 1997, Cyclone Gretelle destroyed 80% of the Manombo forest canopy. With their habitat, including {{most of their}} food resources, effectively destroyed, the ruffed lemurs of the forest broadened their diet, remaining surprisingly frugivorous. Their body weights dropped and no births were reported for four years, but they managed to stave off starvation. This event demonstrated <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>their</b> flexibility {{in the face of}} natural disasters, which may highlight the evolutionary reasons behind their reproductive capacity and litter size, but also the threat faced by already stressed populations.|$|E

From youth, Filipinos are taught to respect the elders <b>not</b> <b>only</b> within <b>their</b> families but those in their communities as well, be they strangers or relatives.

25|$|The Spanish {{branch of}} the Habsburg royal family was noted for extreme consanguinity. Well aware that they owed their power to {{fortunate}} marriages, they married between themselves to protect their gains. Philip and Mariana were actually uncle and niece; therefore, Charles was <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>their</b> son, but was also Mariana's first-cousin and Philip's great-nephew.|$|E
25|$|Although {{women around}} the world share many {{similarities}} in terms of the health-impacting challenges, there are also many distinct differences that arise from their varying states of socioeconomic conditions.

25|$|Ontario police {{sergeant}} Jeff Quon, {{along with other}} officers and those they were exchanging messages with, had sued the city, their superiors and the pager service provider in federal court. They had alleged a violation of <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>their</b> constitutional rights but federal telecommunications privacy laws. Their defense was that a superior officer had promised the pager messages themselves would not be audited if the officers reimbursed the city for fees it incurred when they exceeded a monthly character limit.|$|E

25|$|Children's {{motivation}} to learn is not solely influenced on {{their desire to}} belong but also their eagerness to see their community succeed.

By having high levels of social concern the indigenous children are showing concern for <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>their</b> learning but also their peers', which serves as an example of their instilled sense of responsibility for their community. They wish to succeed as a united group rather than just themselves.|$|E
25|$|After the {{reinvestment}} in 2007, the municipalities {{gained a}} potential upside on their investments of between 0.5% and 3.0% above risk-free placements, but instead risked losing <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>their</b> entire investment, {{but in a}} worst-case scenario twice what they invested. A total of NOK 451 million was invested, but was 'geared' by borrowing an additional amount corresponding to ten times the investment, so that - in reality - the municipalities were actually investing between NOK 4 and 5 billion. In a worst-case scenario the municipalities could lose NOK 900 million.|$|E

25|$|Plakoglobin (also called gamma-catenin) has {{a strikingly}} similar {{architecture}} {{to that of}} beta-catenin. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>their</b> ARM domains resemble each other in both architecture and ligand binding capacity, but the N-terminal β-TrCP-binding motif is also conserved in plakoglobin, implying common ancestry and shared regulation with β-catenin. However, plakoglobin is a very weak transactivator when bound to DNA – this is probably caused by the divergence of their C-terminal sequences (plakoglobin appears to lack the transactivator motifs, and thus inhibits the Wnt pathway target genes instead of activating them).|$|E
25|$|The Abbasid Revolution was {{distinguished}} {{by a number}} of tactics which were absent in the other, unsuccessful anti-Umayyad rebellions at the time. Chief among them was secrecy. While the Shi'ite and other rebellions at the time were all led by publicly known leaders making clear and well-defined demands, the Abbasids hid <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>their</b> identities but also their preparation and mere existence. As-Saffah would go on to become the first Abbasid caliph, but he did not come forward to receive the pledge of allegiance from the people until after the Umayyad caliph and a large number of his princes were already killed.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, Eugene and Julia McMahon, {{who owned}} two funeral homes in Yonkers, New York, became {{friendly}} with Walter and Mary Ann McNulty, fellow parishioners at their church. Mrs. McNulty, a broker {{with what was}} then Shearson/American Express, persuaded Mrs. McMahon to invest <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>their</b> personal savings but also their employee's retirement and profit sharing funds with her company. Two years later, McNulty persuaded the McMahons to sign power of attorney forms allowing Shearson to make trades without their consent. Those standard form contracts contained an arbitration clause committing either party to use that method of resolving disputes.|$|E

25|$|The {{culture of}} the ancient Phoenicians {{was one of the}} first to have had a {{significant}} effect on the history of wine. Phoenicia was a civilization centered in the northern reaches of Canaan along the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. Between 1550 BC and 300 BC, the Phoenicians developed a maritime trading culture that expanded their influence from the Levant to North Africa, the Greek Isles, Sicily, and the Iberian Peninsula. Through contact and trade, they spread <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>their</b> alphabet but also their knowledge of viticulture and winemaking, including the propagation of several ancestral varieties of the Vitis vinifera species of wine grapes.|$|E

25|$|Sirens were {{believed}} to combine women and birds in various ways. In early Greek art, Sirens were represented as birds with large women's heads, bird feathers and scaly feet. Later, they were represented as female figures with the legs of birds, with or without wings, playing a variety of musical instruments, especially harps. The tenth-century Byzantine encyclopedia Suda says that from their chests up Sirens had the form of sparrows, below they were women, or, alternatively, that they were little birds with women's faces. Birds were chosen because of their beautiful voices. Later Sirens were sometimes depicted as beautiful women, whose bodies, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>their</b> voices, are seductive.|$|E
