With p2p-streaming, movies are not streamed from a central server or {{content delivery network}} (CDN), but from other users who have parts of the movie on their units after seeing the movie earlier. This process begins when a user clicks play for a movie and continues throughout the viewing time, allowing for seamless viewing. After the viewer has completed watching the video, parts of the video file remains for a time on the user's device.

Classical, CPU-based architecture of early Cisco devices coupled with flexibility of operating system IOS allowed for keeping up with evolving technology needs by means of frequent software upgrades.

Although Cisco was strongly rooted in the enterprise environment, the company was quick to capture the emerging service provider environment, entering the SP market with new, high-capacity product lines such as Cisco 7000 and Cisco 8500.|$|E
25|$|In October 2011, a {{research}} team from ESIEA {{claimed to have}} discovered a way to compromise the Tor network by decrypting communication passing over it. The technique they describe requires creating a map of Tor <b>network</b> <b>nodes,</b> controlling one third of them, and then acquiring their encryption keys and algorithm seeds. Then, using these known keys and seeds, they claim the ability to decrypt two encryption layers out of three. They claim to break the third key by a statistical-based attack. In order to redirect Tor traffic to the nodes they controlled, they used a denial-of-service attack. A response to this claim has been published on the official Tor Blog stating that these rumours of Tor's compromise are greatly exaggerated.|$|E

So the <b>network</b> <b>node</b> would be a bottle-neck due to the increasing amount of data flow. In order to solve this problem, this paper propose an extensible design, we create a internal virtual router in each compute node, the internal virtual router just can process the East-West traffic in lay 2. With the help of distributed router, the East-West traffic can be delivered directly from the source hypervisor to the destination hypervisor, {{no longer need to}} traverse the router in <b>network</b> <b>node</b> to get routing decision, Therefore, North-South and East-West traffic don't impact each other anymore. North-South traffic enjoys all the bandwidth of router in <b>network</b> <b>node</b> exclusively, hence reduce the load of the <b>network</b> <b>node.</b> Experiment results show that OpenStack with distributed router has a much better performance evaluation than original OpenStack. This will dramatically increase the total bandwidth, and also bring other advantages. ...|$|R
