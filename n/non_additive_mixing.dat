The main enhancement of [2] is that a <b>non</b> <b>additive</b> (weighted) trust and reputation can be computed privately. Three algorithms for computing <b>non</b> <b>additive</b> reputation are proposed in [3]. The algorithms have various degrees of privacy and different levels of protection against adversarial users. These schemes are computationally secure regardless {{of the number of}} dishonest users.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Usual {{segmentation}} {{techniques of}} grayscale images depend on supervised trial-and-error procedures. Moreover, in noisy images, local classi¯cation schemes fail {{due to the}} random °uctuations introduced by the noise. Recent proposals as the active contours may be robust enough to cope with some cases of noisy images without supervision (except for the initialization step), but still fail with images with <b>non</b> <b>additive</b> noise that are common in remote sensing, SAR images and other cases. In this work we propose a di®erent approach to noisy image segmentation, based on fractal dimension classi¯cation. Instead of detecting local changes in the image grey level, a previous step of local fractal (box counting) dimension is applied. Histogram classi¯cation of this attribute of the image allows an adequate threshold detection. Therefore, the complete segmentation procedure is fully automatic. The segmentation results obtained with this classi¯cation procedure are remarkably robust, even with images with <b>non</b> <b>additive</b> noise. ...|$|R
40|$|In Multi Attribute Decision Analysis, {{a finite}} number of {{alternatives}} has to be compared together with respect to {{a finite number}} of criteria. To this purpose, <b>non</b> <b>additive</b> measures and the Choquet integral were intensively used to compute the alternative score. Despite simpler methods, like the Weighted Average, approaches based on <b>non</b> <b>additive</b> measures permit to model interactions among criteria, {{and at the same time}} are methodologically well-founded. In the case of non monotonic measures, conflicting relationships among criteria can be considered. Anywise, up to now, only little effort was devoted to formalize and to solve problems where the measure values are uncertain. This paper suggests a way to overcome this lack. In particular, the Multi Attribute Decision problem will be translated into different optimization problems, depending on the way the uncertainty is represented and, more important, if the monotonicity constraints need to be included or not...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{approach}} to homotopical algebra where the basic ingredient is a category with two classes of distinguished morphisms: strong and weak equivalences. These data determine the cofibrant objects by an extension property analogous to the classical lifting property of projective modules. We define a Cartan-Eilenberg category as a category with strong and weak equivalences such {{that there is an}} equivalence between its localization with respect to weak equivalences and the localised category of cofibrant objets with respect to strong equivalences. This equivalence allows us to extend the classical theory of derived additive functors to this <b>non</b> <b>additive</b> setting. The main examples include Quillen model categories and functor categories with a triple, in the last case we find examples in which the class of strong equivalences is not determined by a homotopy relation. Among other applications, we prove the existence of filtered minimal models for cdg algebras over a zero-characteristic field and we formulate an acyclic models theorem for <b>non</b> <b>additive</b> functors...|$|R

The highlights of the new entropy are that it is bounded by finite limits {{and that it is}} <b>non</b> <b>additive</b> in nature. The <b>non</b> <b>additive</b> property of the proposed entropy makes it useful for the representation of information content in the non-extensive systems containing some degree of regularity or correlation. The effectiveness of the proposed entropy in representing the correlated random variables is demonstrated by applying it for the texture classification problem since textures found in nature are random {{and at the same time}} contain some degree of correlation or regularity at some scale. The gray level co-occurrence probabilities (GLCP) are used for computing the entropy function. The experimental results indicate high degree of the classification accuracy. The performance of the new entropy function is found superior to other forms of entropy such as Shannon, Renyi, Tsallis and Pal and Pal entropies on comparison. Using the feature based polar interaction maps (FBIM) the proposed entropy is shown to be the best measure among the entropies compared for representing the correlated textures...|$|R

An aggregation operator, like the Choquet integral based on suitable <b>non</b> <b>additive</b> measure, is able to perform a wide set of aggregation, includ-ing synergic and redundancy interactions. Given a set of criteria, a <b>non</b> <b>additive</b> measure is a set function that assigns a value to any subset (coalition) of criteria. Supposing to deal with benefit criteria only, the monotonicity is a strong requirement, that is, if more criteria are satisfied, the satisfaction degree of a rational Decision Maker cannot decrease. Even if rarely applied, non monotonic measures are useful in the cases where a strong conflict exist between some subset of criteria. This is the case, for instance, where two criteria are benefit if considered by alone, but if the values of both of them is high, the satisfaction degree becomes lower than the minimum of the single satisfaction.
