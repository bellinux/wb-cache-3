SummaryEach year in Australia approximately 551 children are born with moderate to profound permanent childhood hearing impairment. Universal <b>neonatal</b> hearing <b>screening</b> aims to identify those children born with moderate to profound PCHI and provide {{them and their families}} with access to an appropriate intervention in order to minimise the impact of their hearing impairment. Universal <b>neonatal</b> hearing <b>screening</b> is undertaken in each Australian state and territory. This working paper {{presents a}} set of performance indicators for monitoring <b>neonatal</b> hearing <b>screening</b> activity in Australia at a national level. National evaluation and monitoring provides a measure of how well <b>neonatal</b> hearing <b>screening</b> is achieving its aims and objectives and will enable strengthening of screening practices and administrative processes to further improve outcomes for Australian infants. The indicators are based on the aims, standards and objectives for <b>neonatal</b> hearing <b>screening</b> outlined in the National Framework for <b>Neonatal</b> Hearing <b>Screening</b> (NHSWG 2013). They were developed in consultation with experts and endorsed by the Community Care and Population Health Principal Committee.

Content validity of the PSQ-NHSP was partially established by reviewing available literature on parent satisfaction studies in other pediatric health-care service programs. Construct validity of the PSQ-NHSP was indicated by a significant positive relationship between overall satisfaction and the three specific dimensions in the questionnaire.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate whether universal <b>neonatal</b> hearing <b>screening</b> could be integrated in the youth health care program. The screening was performed by nurses of the well baby clinics. A three stage transient evoked otoacoustic emission screening was performed in three different screening settings in order to study the most effective set up regarding participation, refer rates, and costs. In one setting parents visited the well baby clinic, and in two settings babies were screened at home (either in combination with the screening for metabolic diseases or during an intake visit). Screening was performed on 3114 healthy newborns. The setting where universal <b>neonatal</b> hearing <b>screening</b> is integrated with the screening for metabolic diseases, proved to be most efficient and effective. The participation rate of 88. 9 % was highest in this setting and the overall refer rate (1. 4 %) was the lowest.

In order to evaluate the ARC, 6000 babies were screened at a district maternity hospital {{over a period of}} three years. Every infant subsequently entered a three year follow up programme. One hundred and two babies (1. 7 %) failed the ARC screen (that is, they failed two ARC tests) and 20 of these were found to have some hearing impairment: in 10 it was severe (80 - 90 dBHL), in seven moderate (45 - 60 dBHL), and in three it was mild to moderate (less than 45 dBHL). In addition, of the 20 babies who failed a first test and were discharged before a second could be performed, two were confirmed to have a severe hearing loss; 79 infants failing the screen were cleared on further testing, giving the ARC a false positive rate of 1. 3 %. On following up all 6000 infants for three years, seven children who passed the <b>neonatal</b> <b>screen</b> were subsequently found to have a hearing loss. For two babies the aetiology was unknown but for five the hearing impairment was either due to a hereditary progressive loss or definite postnatal factors.
