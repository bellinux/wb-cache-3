5|$|Thus, the {{aforementioned}} pattern, <b>now</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Titius–Bode law, predicted the semi-major axes of all eight planets {{of the time}} (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Ceres, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus).|$|E
25|$|In 1899, Adolf Baeyer and Victor Villiger first {{published}} {{a demonstration of}} the reaction that we <b>now</b> <b>know</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Baeyer–Villiger oxidation.

50|$|The {{approach}} is best defined <b>as</b> one of <b>the</b> many arguments {{used to explain}} the Holocaust. This reasoning focuses on those of lower rank and their pressuring of higher ranks to implement what we <b>now</b> <b>know</b> <b>as</b> <b>The</b> Final Solution.|$|R
50|$|Lefschetz {{proves that}} if the {{coincidence}} number is nonzero, then f and g have a coincidence point. He notes in his paper that letting X = Y and letting g be the identity map gives a simpler result, which we <b>now</b> <b>know</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> fixed point theorem.|$|R
5|$|A wing at Dovercourt Cottage Hospital – {{which is}} <b>now</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Captain Fryatt Memorial Hospital. – was named in Fryatt's honour. A public house in nearby Parkeston is also named in Captain Fryatt's honour.|$|E

5|$|Another {{approach}} to understanding mirror symmetry was suggested by Andrew Strominger, Shing-Tung Yau, and Eric Zaslow in 1996. According to their conjecture, <b>now</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> SYZ conjecture, mirror symmetry {{can be understood}} by dividing a Calabi–Yau manifold into simpler pieces and then transforming them to get the mirror Calabi–Yau.|$|E

5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} theory {{increased}} {{through the end of}} the 1940s. Improvements in microwave technology made it possible to take more precise measurements of the shift of the levels of a hydrogen atom, <b>now</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Lamb shift and magnetic moment of the electron. These experiments exposed discrepancies which the theory was unable to explain.|$|E

5|$|New {{concepts}} and mathematical tools provided fresh insights into general relativity, {{giving rise to}} a period in the 1960s–70s <b>now</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> golden age of general relativity.
