25|$|The {{work on the}} pediments {{lasted from}} 438 to 432BC, and the sculptures of the Parthenon pediments {{are some of the}} finest {{examples}} of classical Greek art. The figures are sculpted in <b>natural</b> <b>movement</b> with bodies full of vital energy that bursts through their flesh, as the flesh in turn bursts through their thin clothing. The thin chitons reveal the body underneath as the focus of the composition. The distinction between gods and humans is blurred in the conceptual interplay between the idealism and naturalism bestowed on the stone by the sculptors. Every statue in the west pediment has a fully completed back, which would have been impossible to see when the sculpture was on the temple; this indicates that the sculptors put great effort into accurately portraying the human body.|$|E

Mining activities have contributed to lower water levels in 24 out of the 39 lakes in the Kurtna Lake District. The release of mine water into the environment has changed the <b>natural</b> <b>movement</b> of surface water. As a result of mining activities, groundwater moves towards the excavation cavities.

Point-light animations of these <b>natural</b> <b>movements</b> and phase-scrambled, upside-down {{versions of the same}} knocking movements were shown to participants who were asked to categorize the affect of the display. In both cases the resulting confusion matrices were analyzed using multidimensional scaling. For the <b>natural</b> <b>movements</b> the resulting two-dimensional psychological space was similar to a circumplex with the first dimension appearing as activation and the second dimension as pleasantness. For the scrambled displays the first dimension was similar in structure to that obtained for the <b>natural</b> <b>movements</b> but the second dimension was not. With both <b>natural</b> and scrambled <b>movements</b> Dimension 1 of the psychological space was highly correlated to the kinematics of the movement. These results suggest that the corresponding activation of perceived affect is a formless cue that relates directly to the movement kinematics while the pleasantness of the movement appears to be carried in the phase relations between the different limb segments...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} shown, {{that humans are}} able to learn to {{discriminate}} between dierent styles of <b>natural</b> <b>movements</b> (e. g., gaits or sports movements). However, it remains unknown whether this learning is based on innate templates for biological movement patterns, or if humans can learn representations of new arbitrary complex movements. We address this question by investigating whether subjects can learn articial biological movement stimuli. Methods: We generated biological motion stimuli by linear combination of prototypical trajectories. Spatio-temporal linear combinations were computed using special algorithm, spatio-temporal morphable model (Giese Poggio, 2000, International Journal of Computer Vision, 59 - 73). The following two classes of stimuli were generated: (A) stimuli derived by linear combination of dissimilar <b>natural</b> <b>movements</b> (e. g., walking, kicking and dancing). (B) Stimuli generated by animation of an articial skeleton model that is highly dissimilar from naturally occurring body structures. The joint angle trajectories of the skeleton were given by linear combinations of synthetic trajectories. These trajectories were sinusoidal functions. Their amplitudes and frequencies were approximately matched with the joint trajectories of human actors during <b>natural</b> <b>movements.</b> Subjects had to discriminate between pairs of these stimuli that were dened by linear combinations with slightly dissimilar weights. The trajectories were presented as normal point light walkers (PLW), and as point light walker with position jitter (PLWJ). The PLWJ were generated by adding random displacements of the dots along the skeleton of the walker for in each frame. Each subject took part in two training and three test blocks. Feedback was provided only during training. Results: Subjects trained with stimuli derived from <b>natural</b> <b>movements</b> (group A) learned the discrimination between novel patterns very quickly (about 8 repetitions). For rotation of the test stimuli against the training stimuli we found transfer only for the normal PLW, {{but not for the}} PLWJ stimuli. Subjects were able to learn the completely arti- cial stimuli (group B) presented as PLWJ equally fast as the stimuli from group A. Conclusions: (1) New templates for movement recognition can be learned very quickly. (2) Learning aects at least two dierent levels of representation (local and holistic). (3) The learned holistic representations seem to be view-dependent. (4) There seems to be no signicant dierence in the learning process between stimuli derived from articial and <b>natural</b> <b>movements...</b>|$|R

Tracking is shown to be robust over a range of <b>natural</b> <b>movements,</b> including considerable occlusion. Processing times for tracking two people are at least as short as those for tracking one person using other stochastic schemes. The high performance and efficiency are attributed to the hierarchical search method and the accuracy of the cues in identifying suitable poses. ...|$|R
