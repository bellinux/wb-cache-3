5|$|A small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> of Ashen {{were sent}} to various people. Marty Rytkonen, of Bindrune Recordings, {{was the only person}} {{attached}} to a record label to receive one, and Celestiial was then taken on by Bindrune. Anderson was very happy with this, as he had been an avid reader of Worm Gear (a magazine attached to the label) when he was younger. Despite the fact that Anderson had not written Desolate North with the intention of it ever being released, in 2006, it was released by Bindrune Recordings. The CD version released by Bindrune Recordings is now out of print. However, in 2011, the album was rereleased in vinyl LP format by Handmade Birds, and the album remains available in digital format.|$|E

5|$|On October 5, 2004, Aladdin was re{{released}} onto VHS and for {{the first}} time released onto DVD, as part of Disney's Platinum Edition line. The DVD release featured retouched and cleaned-up animation, prepared for Aladdin's planned but ultimately cancelled IMAX reissue in 2003, and a second disc with bonus features. Accompanied by a $19 million marketing campaign, the DVD sold about 3million units in its first month, but it was less than the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>copies,</b> sold in that amount of time, by any other Platinum Edition released before it. The film's soundtrack was available in its original Dolby 5.1 track or in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix. The DVD went into moratorium in January 2008, along with its sequels.|$|E
5|$|The Moran model assumes {{overlapping}} generations. At {{each time}} step, one individual is chosen to reproduce and one individual is chosen to die. So in each timestep, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> {{of a given}} allele can go up by one, go down by one, or can stay the same. This means that the transition matrix is tridiagonal, which means that mathematical solutions are easier for the Moran model than for the Wright–Fisher model. On the other hand, computer simulations are usually easier to perform using the Wright–Fisher model, because fewer time steps need to be calculated. In the Moran model, it takes N timesteps to get through one generation, where N is the effective population size. In the Wright–Fisher model, it takes just one.|$|E
40|$|A {{theory is}} {{developed}} {{that provides the}} sampling distribution of low frequency alleles at a single locus {{under the assumption that}} each allele {{is the result of a}} unique mutation. The <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> each allele is assumed to follow a linear birth-death process with sampling. If the population is of constant size, standard results from theory of birth-death processes show that the distribution <b>of</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> each allele is logarithmic and that the joint distribution <b>of</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> k alleles found in a sample of size n follows the Ewens sampling distribution. If the population from which the sample was obtained was increasing in size, if there are different selective classes of alleles, or if there are differences in penetrance among alleles, the Ewens distribution no longer applies. Likelihood functions for a given set of observations are obtained under different alternative hypotheses. These results are applied to published data from the BRCA 1 locus (associated with early onset breast cancer) and the factor VIII locus (associated with hemophilia A) in humans. In both cases, the sampling distribution of alleles allows rejection of the null hypothesis, but relatively small deviations from the null model can account for the data. In particular, roughly the same population growth rate appears consistent with both data sets...|$|R

5|$|The {{death of}} {{four members of}} the nobility was {{sufficiently}} important to ensure that the event was recorded in contemporary chronicles, most notably by Froissart and the Monk of St Denis, and subsequently illustrated in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> of illuminated manuscripts. While the two main chroniclers agree on essential points of the evening—the dancers were dressed as wild men, the King survived, one man fell into a vat, and four of the dancers died—there are discrepancies in the details. Froissart wrote that the dancers were chained together, which is not mentioned in the monk's account. Furthermore, the two chroniclers are at odds regarding the purpose of the dance. According to the historian Susan Crane, the monk describes the event as a wild charivari with the audience participating in the dance, whereas Froissart's description suggests a theatrical performance without audience participation.|$|E

5|$|When it {{was first}} {{published}} in 1932, the novel was moderately successful; 11,000 copies were initially printed, with a total of four printings {{by the end of the}} year, although a significant <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> from the fourth printing had not been sold by 1936. In 1935, Maurice Coindreau translated the novel into French. In the same year, it was translated into German along with several other novels and short stories by Faulkner. These works initially met with approval from the Nazi censors and received much attention from German literary critics, because they assumed that Faulkner was a conservative agrarian positively depicting the struggle for racial purity; soon after, however, Faulkner's works were banned by the Nazis, and post-war German criticism reappraised him as an optimistic Christian humanist.|$|E
5|$|Pound's {{editorial}} {{choices were}} {{based on what he}} saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with Imagist precepts, rather than active participation in a group as such. Williams, who was based in the United States, had not participated in any of the discussions of the Eiffel Tower group. However, he and Pound had long been corresponding {{on the question of the}} renewal of poetry along similar lines. Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound, as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier, Pre-Raphaelite-influenced style towards a harder, more modern way of writing. The inclusion of a poem by Joyce, I Hear an Army, which was sent to Pound by W.B. Yeats, took on a wider importance in the history of literary modernism, as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication, at Pound's behest, of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in The Egoist. Joyce's poem is not written in free verse, but in rhyming quatrains. However, it strongly reflects Pound's interest in poems written to be sung to music, such as those by the troubadours and Guido Cavalcanti. The book met with little popular or critical success, at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do, and a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> were returned to the publisher.|$|E
5|$|The law {{of large}} numbers predicts that when the {{absolute}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> of the allele is small (e.g., in small populations), the magnitude of drift on allele frequencies per generation is larger. The magnitude of drift {{is large enough to}} overwhelm selection at any allele frequency when the selection coefficient is less than 1 divided by the effective population size. Non-adaptive evolution resulting from the product of mutation and genetic drift is therefore considered to be a consequential mechanism of evolutionary change primarily within small, isolated populations. The mathematics of genetic drift depend on the effective population size, {{but it is not clear}} how this is related to the actual number of individuals in a population. Genetic linkage to other genes that are under selection can reduce the effective population size experienced by a neutral allele. With a higher recombination rate, linkage decreases and with it this local effect on effective population size. This effect is visible in molecular data as a correlation between local recombination rate and genetic diversity, and negative correlation between gene density and diversity at noncoding DNA regions. Stochasticity associated with linkage to other genes that are under selection is not the same as sampling error, and is sometimes known as genetic draft in order to distinguish it from genetic drift.|$|E

For the problem, several heuristic algo-rithms are developed using greedy search methods and simulation.

Simulation results are used to deter-mine search directions or to select tool types <b>of</b> which the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>copies</b> are to be increased.
