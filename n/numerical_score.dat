5|$|At {{the end of}} each song, {{a result}} screen is {{displayed}} to player, and his or her performance is rated with a letter grade, a <b>numerical</b> <b>score,</b> and a percentage that represents his or her accuracy. The player is awarded a number of fans and in-game money for his or her performance. The number of fans determine the idols' ranking, and as the player's idols increase in ranking, more items become available for purchase. These items can then be used to customize the game's appearance or adjust gameplay elements, such as straightening the Melody Lines' shapes or causing the player to gain fans quicker. Finishing a song also earns the player Memories with the idols who perform the song, which can be used in the Star of Festa game mode.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completing}} a mission, the player is awarded a rank, {{starting with the}} lowest at C and going to B, A and S, which is the highest. The ranks are based on three categories: Power, Technique, and Speed, each determined by meeting certain conditions in a battle. All three categories are rated {{on a scale from}} 0-150, and added together to form a numerical ranking from 0-450 in addition to their letter ranking; for example, any score between 300-450 earns an S ranking. Unlike previous games, the <b>numerical</b> <b>score</b> is not converted into points that can be redeemed to purchase new maps and COs; instead, COs are unlocked after the completion of certain missions and all maps (with the exception of training missions) are available at the beginning of gameplay.|$|E

Aggregator website Metacritic, which averages professional reviews into a <b>numerical</b> <b>score,</b> gave Charmbracelet {{a score of}} 43/100, indicating [...] "mixed or average reviews". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic rated the album two out of five stars, and criticized its production and the condition of Carey's voice. He wrote, [...] "Whenever she sings, there's a raspy whistle behind her thin voice and she strains to make notes throughout the record...Her voice is damaged, and there's not a moment where it sounds strong or inviting." [...] Tom Sinclair of [...] Entertainment Weekly said she was [...] "in fine voice". He wrote that [...] "Through the Rain" [...] sinks in its own sodden sentimentality, as do by-the-numbers efforts like 'Yours' and 'I Only Wanted'", and added that [...] "Clown' is a moody number graced with mournful acoustic guitar and a gorgeously nuanced vocal, while 'Sunflowers for Alfred Roy' is a short, sweet song sung to a lovely piano accompaniment". He finished by saying that [...] "too much of Charmbracelet is mired in middle-of-the-road muck." ...|$|E
500|$|The Emancipation of Mimi {{received}} a 64 out of 100 (indicating [...] "generally positive reviews") on Metacritic, a website that averages professional reviews from critics into a <b>numerical</b> <b>score.</b> Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the album a [...] "highly crafted piece of dance-pop" [...] and [...] "relative comeback" [...] for Carey, {{although it is}} not as [...] "catchy" [...] as he thought it should have been. Erlewine voiced a common criticism of the album: that Carey's voice seemed [...] "damaged" [...] in comparison to her [...] "glory years" [...] in the 1990s. He commented that in the belted songs such as [...] "Fly Like a Bird" [...] and [...] "I Wish You Knew", Carey's voice sounded [...] "as airy, thin, and damaged as it did on Charmbracelet". Michael Paoletta from Billboard was less critical of her vocals, writing that [...] "while her voice has lost some of the power through the years, Mimi deftly showcases her still-considerable pipes with strong lyrics and slick production." [...] Paoletta praised The Emancipation of Mimi as Carey's best album since Butterfly (1997). Michael Dougall Bell from the Calgary Sun called Carey's voice [...] "very impressive". He concluded: [...] "While Emancipation may not send Carey's stock or star back up to where it once was and where that voice deserves to be, at least she's not plummeting – she's merely levelled off." [...] Entertainment Weekly editor Tom Sinclair noted that almost every song [...] "showcases Carey's undeniable vocal strengths". Reviewing [...] "Fly Like a Bird", Sinclair concluded, [...] "It's so moving that we'll resist the temptation to be crass and interpret the song as a plea for heightened record sales. Help from above is always welcome, but Emancipation sounds like it just might do fine all on its own." ...|$|E
500|$|E=MC² {{received}} a 63/100 (indicating [...] "generally positive reviews") {{on the website}} Metacritic, which averages professional reviews into a <b>numerical</b> <b>score.</b> Stephen Thomas Erlewine, senior editor of Allmusic, rated the album three out of five stars, and wrote [...] "it's misleading to judge Mariah based on her new record of possessing the most number one singles, as she's not about longevity, she's about being permanently transient, a characteristic 'E=MC²' captures all too well." [...] Billboards Gary Trust felt that on the album, Carey was in [...] "pristine form", stating, [...] "She's proclaimed emancipation before, but Mariah Carey's never sounded as free as she does on her 10th album. Carey's made a pop album with equal parts levity and gravity." [...] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Margeaux Watson graded E=MC² an 'A-', and described how the album's goal was to prove [...] "her comeback was no fluke". She continued complimenting the album's several collaborations, and wrote [...] "the result is a largely enjoyable mix of flirtatious club jams, midtempo love songs, and emotional ballads anchored by hip-hop beats that handsomely showcase the singer's powerful vocal chops." [...] Though Carey's voice had been criticized since her 2002 release, Charmbracelet, {{for not being able}} to deliver the [...] "gravity defying vocals" [...] from the 1990s, Roger Friedman from Fox News wrote [...] "Her infamous eight-octave range has suffered a little wear and tear over the years, but Carey still can flutter from great highs to mellow lows like no one else." [...] Alex Macpherson from The Guardian gave the album four out of five stars, heavily describing the singer's vocal state throughout the album: [...] "Carey's voice has been mocked, bizarrely, as being a triumph of technique over soul - an argument that fails to comprehend that technique and soul are intertwined, that technique primarily exists as a means to convey emotion - but she is on fine vocal form throughout 'E=MC²', whether belting out massive ballads, or layering her voice into a swooning bank of a hundred Mariahs." [...] Macpherson concluded his review with, [...] "When she sings elsewhere, [...] "Them other regularities, they can't compare with MC," [...] "it is hard not to agree", referencing a lyric on [...] "For the Record".|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates how to blindly {{evaluate}} the visual quality {{of an image}} by learning rules from linguistic descriptions. Extensive psychological evidence shows that humans prefer to conduct evaluations qualitatively rather than numerically. The qualitative evaluations are then converted into the <b>numerical</b> <b>scores</b> to fairly benchmark objective image quality assessment (IQA) metrics. Recently, lots of learning-based IQA models are proposed by analyzing the mapping from the images to numerical ratings. However, the learnt mapping can hardly be accurate enough because some information has been lost in such an irreversible conversion from the linguistic descriptions to <b>numerical</b> <b>scores.</b> In this paper, we propose a blind IQA model, which learns qualitative evaluations directly and outputs <b>numerical</b> <b>scores</b> for general utilization and fair comparison. Images are represented by natural scene statistics features. A discriminative deep model is trained to classify the features into five grades, corresponding to five explicit mental concepts, i. e., excellent, good, fair, poor, and bad. A newly designed quality pooling is then applied to convert the qualitative labels into scores. The classification framework is not only much more natural than the regression-based models, but also robust to {{the small sample size}} problem. Thorough experiments are conducted on popular databases to verify the model&# 39;s effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness...|$|R

The advantage of this method is manifold- maintains transparency in the selection process; authority can achieved the least cost economic efficiency and, thereby, saves resources by utilising the competitive environment among the shortlisted contractors. ...|$|R
