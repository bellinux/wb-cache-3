The aim of this field study was the quantitative determi-nation of the short-term N 2 O emission after application of a fertilizer with the new nitrification inhibitor (NI) 3, 4 -dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) to winter wheat. NO 3 – and NH 4 + fertilizers labelled with 15 N in liquid and <b>granulated</b> <b>form</b> were used in specific fertili-zer strategies. N fertilizers with higher NO 3 – contents caused higher N 2 O emission than NH 4 + fertilizers. For fertilizers with NIs, used in simplified fertilizer strate-gies with fewer applications and an earlier timing of the N fertilization, the N 2 O release was reduced by about 20 %. Of the total N 2 O emission measured, 10 – 40 % was attributed to fertilizer N and 60 – 90 % originated from soil N. Besides the fertilizer NO 3 –-N, the microbial available-N pool in the soil represented a further impor-tant source for N 2 O losses. Compared to liquid fertili-zers, the application in <b>granulated</b> <b>form</b> led to smaller N 2 O emissions. For fertilizers with NIs, the decrease in the N 2 O emission is mainly due to their low NO 3 –-N content and the possibility of reducing the number of ap-plications...|$|R

25|$|Sucralose is {{a highly}} {{heat-stable}} noncaloric sweetener, allowing it {{to be used in}} many recipes with little or no sugar.

While the granulated sucralose provides apparent volume-for-volume sweetness, the texture in baked products may be noticeably different. Sucralose is not hygroscopic, which can lead to baked goods that are noticeably drier and manifest a less dense texture than those made with sucrose. Unlike sucrose, which melts when baked at high temperatures, sucralose maintains its granular structure when subjected to dry, high heat (e.g., in a 350°F or 180°C oven). Furthermore, in its pure state, sucralose begins to decompose at 119°C or 246°F. Thus, in some baking recipes, such as crème brûlée, which require sugar sprinkled on top to partially or fully melt and crystallize, substituting sucralose will not result in the same surface texture, crispness, or crystalline structure.|$|R

The resulting maximum safe concentration was calculated for dogs and cats and was extrapolated to other non food-producing animals. The maximum safe concentration was 25 mg Quinoline Yellow/kg complete feed for all non food-producing animals.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} {{was to examine the}} effects of {{electron}} radiation on physicochemical properties of pristine poly(lactic acid) (PLA), or polylactide, and of polylactide containing a selected crosslinking agent. Design/methodology/approach: Samples to be examined were prepared in <b>granulated</b> <b>forms</b> or as moulded pieces and then treated with the high-energy electron radiation (ca. 10 MeV). The methods of gel permeation chromatography (GPC), rheology, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMA) were used to determine physicochemical properties of the samples. A humidity sensor was utilised to determine water vapour permeability. Findings: It has been found that PLA undergoes degradation upon the electron radiation. Triallyl isocyanurate (TAIC) when introduced into polylactide causes plasticization of this polymer whereas irradiation of polylactide containing TAIC leads to crosslinking of PLA. Crosslinked PLA exhibits limited plastic flow or no flow at all and an elevated glass transition temperature. Water vapour permeability of a film made of PLA modified this way is much less than that of a film produced from original PLA. Research limitations/implications: Further studies of crosslinked PLA are advisable, especially assessment of the gelation degree, strength of the plasticized material, and biodegradation. Practical implications: Crosslinked PLA may be applied in practical processes, especially in thermoforming in which increased resistance of a material against deformation at elevated temperatures is required. Originality/value: Substantial influence of the electron radiation on properties of PLA was established. The material undergoes significant degradation upon even relatively small radiation doses. In order to crosslink PLA, TAIC in the amount of ca. 3 wt% and the electron radiation doses of up to ca. 60 kGy have to be applied...|$|R

Conceptus-medi-ated recruitment of uterine (u) NK cells in the pig was proposed based on evidence that elevated uNK activity was temporally associated with increased leukocyte density in endometrium un-derlying conceptuses. The objective {{of this study was to}} deter-mine whether uNK cells were more abundant at embryonic at-tachment sites during the early postattachment period. Mono-nuclear leukocytes were isolated from endometrium at attach-ment sites versus between attachment sites, and expression of CD 16, a marker for NK cells, was assessed by flow cytometry. CD 16 binding was normalized to leukocyte numbers in each sample. CD 161 small lymphocytes were more frequent in uter-us than in blood (41 % 6 2 % versus 26 % 6 4 %). Differences between pregnant and luteal phase uterus (43 % 6 2 % versus 31 % 6 7 %, respectively) were not statistically significant. In pregnant animals, CD 161 lymphocytes were slightly but signif-icantly more abundant in uterus at attachment sites versus be-tween attachment sites at Days 15 – 17, 21 – 22, and 25 – 28. Be-fore normalization, CD 161 large, granular cells were more abundant at attachment sites versus between attachment sites; however, these differences were removed when data were nor-malized according to leukocyte numbers. Further characteriza-tion showed that the proportion of large granular leukocytes expressing CD 8, reactive with NK cells and T cell subsets, was 2 -fold higher in pregnant uterus than in maternal blood.
