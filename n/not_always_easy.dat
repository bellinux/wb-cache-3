5|$|David's {{activities}} and whereabouts after 1114 are <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> to trace. He {{spent much of}} his time outside his principality, in England and in Normandy. Despite the death of his sister on 1 May 1118, David still possessed the favour of King Henry when his brother Alexander died in 1124, leaving Scotland without a king.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> {{to predict}} a grown Appaloosa's color at birth. Foals of any breed {{tend to be}} born with coats that darken when they shed their baby hair. In addition, Appaloosa foals do not always show classic leopard complex characteristics. Patterns {{sometimes}} change {{over the course of}} the horse's life although some, such as the blanket and leopard patterns, tend to be stable. Horses with the varnish roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth, developing more visible spotting as they get older.|$|E
5|$|L.lubrica fruit {{bodies are}} similar to those of Cudonia confusa, {{commonly}} known as the cinnamon jellybaby. The species can be differentiated by the fact that L.lubrica fruit bodies are more sturdy, and those of C.confusa are much paler in colour. Another Cudonia species, C. circinans (which is highly similar to C. lutea), is similar to L. lubrica, though it can be differentiated by its colour (which is more brown), spores (which are smaller and thinner) and texture (which is less slimy and gelatinous than L. lubrica). L. lubrica fruit bodies can also be mistaken for those of the much rarer L.atrovirens, which can be differentiated by its darker colouration. L.viscosa can again be differentiated by colouration; the species has a green head. However, as L. lubrica fruit bodies can sometimes have a greenish hue, differentiation between the two species is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy.</b>|$|E

25|$|Since ravines {{were often}} {{formed by the}} union of several thalwegs upstream, the choice of which {{tributary}} to keep as the boundary marker between plots of land up high was <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> and often led to disputes. This problem was aggravated {{by the fact that}} some of the ravines in question had several names, which made for a possible source of confusion.|$|E
25|$|The {{symbolism}} used {{in ancient}} churches is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> for modern people to read. Virtues and vices may {{be represented by}} small figures with particular attributes, or by animals that were thought to embody a particular quality. A common example is the pelican which was thought to peck its breast to feed its young on the blood, thus representing the love of Christ for the Church.|$|E

25|$|Identification of Japanese {{knotweed}} is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy.</b> Many {{other plants}} {{are suspected of}} being knotweed, due often to the similar appearance of leaves and stems. Dogwood, lilac, Houttuynia (Houttuynia cordata), ornamental Bistorts such as Red Bistort (Persicaria amplexicaulis), lesser knotweed (Persicaria campanulata), Himalayan Balsam (Impatiens glandulifera), Broadleaved Dock (Rumex obtusifolius), Bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis), bamboo, Himalayan Honeysuckle (Leycesteria formosa), and Russian Vine (Fallopia baldschuanica) have been suspected of being Fallopia japonica.|$|E
25|$|Milton embraced many heterodox Christian {{theological}} views. He {{rejected the}} Trinity, {{in the belief}} that the Son was subordinate to the Father, a position known as Arianism; and his sympathy or curiosity was probably engaged by Socinianism: in August 1650 he licensed for publication by William Dugard the Racovian Catechism, based on a non-trinitarian creed.

25|$|During {{the seventeenth}} and eighteenth centuries, or the Age of Enlightenment, neo-classical culture was pervasive. English {{literature}} {{in the middle of that}} period has been dubbed Augustan. It is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> to distinguish Horace's influence during those centuries (the mixing of influences is shown for example in one poet's pseudonym, Horace Juvenal). However a measure of his influence can be found in the diversity of the people interested in his works, both among readers and authors.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> to {{determine}} whether B12 deficiency is present, especially within older adults. Patients may present with violent behaviour or more subtle personality changes. They may also present with vague complaints, such as fatigue or memory loss, that {{may be attributed to}} normative aging processes. Cognitive symptoms may mimic behaviour in Alzheimer's and other dementias as well. Tests must be run on individuals presenting with such signs to confirm or negate cobalamin deficiency within the blood.|$|E
25|$|The {{t-distribution}} {{is often}} used {{as an alternative to}} the normal distribution as a model for data, which often has heavier tails than the normal distribution allows for; see e.g. Lange et al. The classical approach was to identify outliers and exclude or downweight them in some way. However, it is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> to identify outliers (especially in high dimensions), and the t-distribution is a natural choice of model for such data and provides a parametric approach to robust statistics.|$|E

25|$|Behavioral and {{ecological}} separation of tinamou species is evident where their ranges overlap through {{the utilization of}} different food sources and occupation of limited micro-habitats. These micro-habitats are <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> to identify, and are highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Some species, such as the red-winged tinamou, utilize multiple habitats such as the open savannas of Amazonia and the dry valleys of the Andes. Similarly, brown tinamous occur in both the Amazon basin and the humid montane forests on the Andean slope.|$|E
25|$|In Paris Huygens had an {{important}} patron and correspondent in Jean-Baptiste Colbert. However, {{his relationship with the}} Academy was <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy,</b> and in 1670 Huygens, seriously ill, chose Francis Vernon to carry out a donation of his papers to the Royal Society in London, should he die. Then the Franco-Dutch War took place (1672–8). England's part in it (1672–4) is thought to have damaged his relationship with the Royal Society. Robert Hooke for the Royal Society lacked the urbanity to handle the situation, in 1673.|$|E
25|$|In his {{commemorative}} speech, Alfred Brauer (PhD candidate Schur) {{spoke about}} Issai Schur as follows: As a teacher, Schur was excellent. His lectures were very clear, but <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> and required cooperation - During the winter semester of 1930, {{the number of}} students who wanted to attend Schur's theory of numbers lecture, was such that the second largest university lecture hall with about 500 seats was too small. His most human characteristics were probably his great modesty, his helpfulness and his human interest in his students.|$|E

25|$|In {{an effort}} to end the shame and secrecy of infertility, Redbook in October 2011 {{launched}} a video campaign, The Truth About Trying, to start an open conversation about infertility, which strikes one in eight women in the United States. In a survey of couples having difficulty conceiving, conducted by the pharmaceutical company Merck, 61 percent of respondents hid their infertility from family and friends. Nearly half didn't even tell their mothers. The message of those speaking out: It's <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> to get pregnant, and there's no shame in that.|$|E
25|$|During the 17th and 18th centuries, {{literary}} theorists in Europe {{distinguished between}} {{two types of}} lyric poetry, loosely associated with Horace and Pindar. Regular verses in four line stanzas were associated with Horace's Odes, which did in fact inspire and influence poets of the period. Irregular verses in longer stanzas were termed Pindarics though the association with Pindar was largely fanciful. Abraham Cowley was considered the main exponent of English Pindarics. In fact, the two styles were <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> to distinguish and many 'Pindaric' odes were quite Horatian in content, as in some poems by Thomas Gray.|$|E
25|$|The {{similarities}} between China today and New York 150 years ago shouldn't {{come as a}} great surprise. Adulteration on such a scandalous scale occurs in societies with a toxic combination of characteristics: a fast-growing capitalist economy coupled with a government {{unable or unwilling to}} regulate the food supply. In such get-rich-quick societies, there is a huge temptation to tamper with food, particularly when margins are low. The rewards are instant, and it's <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> for consumers to detect the difference between the pure and the doctored—particularly with a substance like milk, which we have been taught to trust implicitly.|$|E

25|$|Poses {{fall into}} three basic categories: standing, seated and reclining. Within {{each of these}} there are varying levels of difficulty, so one kind is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> than another. Artists and life drawing {{instructors}} will often prefer poses in which the body is being exerted, for a more dynamic and aesthetically interesting subject. Common poses such as standing twists, slouched seated poses and especially the classical contrapposto are difficult to sustain accurately for any amount of time, although it is often surprising what a skilled model can do. The model's level of experience and skill may {{be taken into account}} in determining the length of the posing session and the difficulty of the poses.|$|R
