Plain knitted fabrics were made by using conductive fibers on a hand-driven V-bed flat knitting machine. The needle movement and loop formation during the knitting action were recorded, and then these images were analyzed by using the image processing approach for obtaining the curvature radius of <b>needle</b> <b>loop.</b> Finally, the knitting actions of two conductive fibers under two conditions were evaluated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background We {{present a}} simple {{technique}} of arthroscopic {{rotator cuff repair}} using a spinal <b>needle</b> and suture <b>loop.</b> Methods With the arthroscope laterally, a spinal <b>needle</b> <b>looped</b> with PDS is inserted percutaneously into the shoulder posteriorly and penetrated through the healthy posterior cuff tear margin. Anteriorly, another spinal needle loaded with PDS is inserted percutaneously to engage the healthy tissue at the anterior tear margin. The suture in the anterior needle is then delivered into the suture loop of the posterior needle using a suture retriever. The posterior <b>needle</b> and <b>loop</b> are then pulled out carrying the anterior suture with it. The two limbs of this suture are then retrieved through a cannula for knotting. The same procedure is then repeated for additional suturing. Suture anchors placed over the greater tuberosity are used to complete the repair. Conclusion This is an easy method of rotator cuff repair using simple instruments and lesser time, hence can be employed at centers with less equipment and at reduced cost to the patient. </p...|$|R

50|$|Knitting is {{the process}} of using two or more <b>needles</b> to <b>loop</b> yarn into a series of {{interconnected}} loops {{in order to create a}} finished garment or some other type of fabric. The word is derived from knot, thought to originate from the Dutch verb knutten, which is similar to the Old English cnyttan, to knot. Its origins lie in the basic human need for clothing for protection against the elements. More recently, hand knitting has become less a necessary skill and more a hobby.|$|R
5000|$|On the CD and {{cassette}} {{versions of}} the album, the song [...] "Invasion" [...] contained about three minutes of looping guitar feedback {{at the end of}} the song. The vinyl record version had the same feedback, but the difference was that it never ended until you picked up the needle. This was because the sound went all the way to the locked groove {{at the end of the}} LP, causing the <b>needle</b> to <b>loop</b> it over and over again. The liner notes state (somewhat implausibly) that no pedals, outboard gear or synthesizers were used anywhere on the album.|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{technique}} {{involves the}} use of a single flat <b>needle.</b> A <b>loop</b> is formed, and the needle passed through the loop. The thread is pulled through the loop, but the knot is not tightened. Left loose, the yarn forms a new <b>loop.</b> The <b>needle</b> is passed through the new loop, forming a chain. At the end of a row, the work may be turned, and each stitch passed through both its partner loop and a loop in the previous row. The work may be performed in a single direction [...] "in the round", forming circles and tubes for socks and mittens.|$|R

50|$|Knitting creates {{multiple}} {{loops of}} yarn, called stitches, {{in a line}} or tube. Knitting has multiple active stitches on the needle at one time. Knitted fabric consists {{of a number of}} consecutive rows of interlocking loops. As each row progresses, a newly created loop is pulled through one or more loops from the prior row, placed on the gaining <b>needle,</b> and the <b>loops</b> from the prior row are then pulled off the other needle.|$|R
50|$|The {{motion of}} the right wrist is used to slip the right <b>needle</b> into the <b>loop</b> of the stitch being knitted and 'scoop' or 'hook' the yarn onto the right needle while the left {{forefinger}} holds the yarn {{across the back of}} the stitch. An alternative method of collecting the yarn involves using the thumb or index finger of the right hand to hold the yarn in place as the new stitch is being pulled out of the loop.|$|R
40|$|When a {{flexible}} filament {{is confined to}} a fluid interface, the balance between capillary attraction, bending resistance, and tension from an external source {{can lead to a}} self-buckling instability. We perform an analysis of this instability and provide analytical formulae that compare favorably with the results of detailed numerical computations. The stability and long-time dynamics of the filament are governed by a single dimensionless elastocapillary number quantifying the ratio between capillary to bending stresses. Complex, folded filament configurations such as <b>loops,</b> <b>needles,</b> and racquet shapes may be reached at longer times, and long filaments can undergo a cascade of self-folding events...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Young's modulus (E) {{has been}} {{measured}} during coolingheating cycles canied out between a fixed upper temperature T 2 (Tz= 340 K) and a gradually decreasing lower temperature TI (TI = 320, 310, 300, 290, 285, 281 and 279. 5 K). The E(T) curves show closed thermal hysteretic loops, which are needlelike for T 1 >Ms while they assume a downward bent shape for Tl<Ms. The occurrence of thermal hysteresis in the coolingheating E Q curves is interpreted {{as evidence of}} the formation, far above Ms, of static martensite embryos, which are stabilized by preexisting lattice defects. The formation, on cooling, and the delayed disappearance, on heating, of these static embryos is believed to be responsible for the <b>needle</b> shaped E(T) <b>loops.</b> Acoustic emission is found to occur only during the heating stages of partial thermal cycles camed out above Ms, suggesting that only the disappearance of a stabilized embryo is associated with an abrupt release of the stored energy. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{magnetization}} {{reversal of}} two-dimensional arrays of parallel ferromagnetic Fe nanowires embedded in nanoporous alumina templates has been studied. By combining bulk magnetization measurements (superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry) with field-dependent {{magnetic force microscopy}} (MFM), {{we have been able}} to decompose the macroscopic hysteresis loop in terms of the irreversible magnetic responses of individual nanowires. The latter are found to behave as monodomain ferromagnetic <b>needles,</b> with hysteresis <b>loops</b> displaced (asymmetric) as a consequence of the strong dipolar interactions between them. The application of field-dependent MFM provides a microscopic method to obtain the hysteresis curve of the array, by simply registering the fraction of up and down magnetized wires as a function of applied field. The observed deviations from the rectangular shape of the macroscopic hysteresis loop of the array can be ascribed to the spatial variation of the dipolar field through the inhomogeneously filled membrane. The system studied proves to be an excellent example of the two-dimensional classical Preisach model, well known from the field of hysteresis modeling and micromagnetism.

A detailed discussion of most of these knots is available in any good book on fly fishing. Some of the knots that are in most every fly angler's arsenal are: the improved clinch knot which is commonly used to attach the fly to the leader, the overhand slip knot or arbor knot which is used to attach the backing to the spool, the albright knot which can be used to attach the fly line to the backing. A loop can also be put in fly line backing using a bimini twist. Often, a loop is added to the business end of the fly line to facilitate the connection to the leader. This loop may take one of several forms. It may be formed by creating a loop in the end of the fly line itself or by adding a braided loop or a loop of monofilament nylon (as in Gray's Loop).
