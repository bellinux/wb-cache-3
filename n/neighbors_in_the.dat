5|$|Beryllium's {{chemical}} {{behavior is}} largely {{a result of its}} small atomic and ionic radii. It thus has very high ionization potentials and strong polarization while bonded to other atoms, which is why all of its compounds are covalent. It is more chemically similar to aluminium than its close <b>neighbors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> periodic table due to having a similar charge-to-radius ratio.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often {{occurring}} in its native form, with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue. The spiral, stair-stepped structure of bismuth crystals {{is the result}} of a higher growth rate around the outside edges than on the inside edges. The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. When burned in oxygen, bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes. Its toxicity is much lower than that of its <b>neighbors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> periodic table, such as lead, antimony, and polonium.|$|E

5|$|Polonium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Po and atomic number 84. A rare and highly radioactive metal with no stable isotopes, polonium is chemically similar to selenium and tellurium, though its metallic character {{resembles that of}} its horizontal <b>neighbors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> periodic table: thallium, lead, and bismuth. Due to the short half-life of all its isotopes, its natural occurrence is limited to tiny traces of the fleeting polonium-210 (with a half-life of 138days) in uranium ores, {{as it is the}} penultimate daughter of natural uranium-238. Though slightly longer-lived isotopes exist, they are much more difficult to produce. Today, polonium is usually produced in milligram quantities by the neutron irradiation of bismuth. Due to its intense radioactivity, which results in the radiolysis of chemical bonds and radioactive self-heating, its chemistry has mostly been investigated on the trace scale only.|$|E
5|$|Strontium is the {{chemical}} element with symbolSr and atomic number38. An alkaline earth metal, strontium is a soft silver-white yellowish metallic element {{that is highly}} reactive chemically. The metal forms a dark oxide layer when it is exposed to air. Strontium has {{physical and chemical properties}} similar to those of its two vertical <b>neighbors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> periodic table, calcium and barium. It occurs naturally in the minerals celestine, strontianite, and putnisite, and is mined mostly from the first two of these. While natural strontium is stable, the synthetic 90Sr isotope is radioactive {{and is one of the}} most dangerous components of nuclear fallout, as strontium is absorbed by the body in a similar manner to calcium. Natural stable strontium, on the other hand, is not hazardous to health.|$|E

5|$|The Eskayas speak a Boholano dialect of Cebuano {{in daily}} life. Boholano-Bisaya is the dominantly used {{language}} among the languages spoken {{by the members}} of the Eskayan tribe.

However, they are better known for an auxiliary language, known as Eskayan, or Ineskaya, which is used for prayers, songs, and formal speeches. Lexically, Eskayan shows no clear relationship with any known language (however, considered to be an encryption of Cebuano) although there is strong but inconsistent Spanish influence. A striking feature of the language is its unusual phonotactics.|$|E
5|$|The Ising {{model is}} used to model the {{behavior}} of magnetic systems. It consists of an array of cells, the state of each of which represents a spin, either up or down. The energy {{of the system is}} measured by a function that depends on the number of neighboring pairs of cells that have the same spin as each other. Therefore, if a cell has equal numbers of <b>neighbors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two states, it may flip its own state without changing the total energy. However, such a flip is energy-conserving only if no two adjacent cells flip at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The Navajo {{may have}} learned to weave from their Pueblo Indian neighbors when they moved into the Four Corners region during the year 1000 A.D. Some experts contend that the Navajo were not weavers until after the 17th century. The Navajo {{obtained}} cotton through local trade routes {{before the arrival of}} the Spanish, after which time they began to use wool. The Pueblo and Navajo were not generally on friendly terms due to frequent Navajo raids on Pueblo settlements, yet many Pueblo sought refuge with their Navajo <b>neighbors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 17th century to evade the conquistadors {{in the aftermath of the}} Pueblo Revolt. This social interchange is the probable origin of the distinctive Navajo weaving tradition. Spanish records show that Navajo people began to herd sheep and weave wool blankets from that time onward.|$|E
