25|$|The use of {{nightingale}} excrement {{dates back}} to the Heian period (AD7941185) when it was introduced to the Japanese by the Koreans. Koreans used the guano to remove dye from kimono fabric, allowing them to make intricate designs on the clothing. The Japanese used the bird droppings to remove stains from silk garments such as kimonos. Then, during the Edo period (AD 16031868), the Japanese expanded its use by using it as a beauty treatment. Some sources, however, report that as early as the third century Japanese women used bags of rice bran and supplies of nightingale droppings to whiten their skin. Geishas and kabuki actors used heavy white makeup that contained zinc and lead, which likely caused many issues such as skin diseases. Uguisu <b>no</b> <b>fun</b> was used to thoroughly remove this makeup and to whiten and balance skin tone. Also, Buddhist monks used the droppings to polish and clean their bald scalps.|$|E

The remix contains lyrical interpolations and an instrumental sample from [...] "Ain't <b>No</b> <b>Fun</b> (If the Homies Can't Have None)" [...] by Snoop Dogg. In an interview with MTV News, Carey spoke of the song's remix before its official release in August 1999: [...] "And then the remix. I'm so excited about the remix. It's also gonna go on the album, and it features Missy Elliott and Da Brat, and it's kinda like a girl-power answer record, and it's to the loop of Snoop 's 'Ain't No Fun.' They're not ready for that one!". A separate music video was filmed for the remix, shot in black and white and featuring a cameo appearance by Dogg. The Desert Storm Remix received mixed reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine chose the song {{as one of the top}} three cuts on Rainbow, alongside the original. Danyel Smith from Entertainment Weekly called it [...] " [...] overblown [...] miscalculation" [...] and wrote [...] "Missy Elliott's and Da Brat's bad sexual politics sink the tired 'Heartbreaker [...]' Larry Flick from Billboard, called the remix [...] "muscular" [...] and [...] "street-savvy" [...] and wrote [...] "Missy Elliott and Da Brat lace rhymes into the track, which is enhanced by the sample from Snoop Dogg's 'Ain't <b>No</b> <b>Fun</b> (If The Homies Can't Have None)'." ...|$|E

Brian Lowry of Variety believed [...] "One does have to question the logic behind adding nipples to the hard-rubber batsuit. Whose idea was that supposed to be anyway, Alfred's?

500|$|The manga's {{critical}} reaction has been mixed.

Other aspects of the series have divided critics' opinions. Manga Life's Michael Aronson praised the enemy designs, while Carlo Santos of Anime News Network (ANN) criticized them, adding the series [...] "is not much fun to read, and certainly <b>no</b> <b>fun</b> to look at". Writing for Active Anime, Sandra Scholes found points {{of interest in the}} series' story, and praised its action.

St. John reported that he watched two episodes, but never tried to mimic Howarth's style because he felt that it was limiting, uncreative, and destructive. He said, [...] "I needed {{to get a sense of}} who Todd was first, and that has to happen organically." [...] He did not care if Marlon Brando portrayed the role before him, and said that even actors who portray Hamlet do it differently, adding, [...] "I don't care what the other guy did.

[...] "I know that sounds very arrogant and overconfident," [...] he stated, [...] "but it would be <b>no</b> <b>fun</b> to try to mimic somebody." ...|$|E
500|$|While at Northwestern, Colbert {{studied with}} the intent of {{becoming}} a dramatic actor; mostly he performed in experimental plays and was uninterested in comedy. He began performing improvisation while in college, both in the campus improv team <b>No</b> <b>Fun</b> Mud Piranhas and at the Annoyance Theatre in Chicago as a part of Del Close's ImprovOlympic {{at a time when the}} project was focused on competitive, long-form improvisation, rather than improvisational comedy. [...] "I wasn't gonna do Second City", Colbert later recalled, [...] "because those Annoyance people looked down on Second City because they thought it wasn't pure improv– there was a slightly snobby, mystical quality to the Annoyance people". After Colbert graduated in 1986, however, he was in need of a job. [...] A friend who was employed at Second City's box office offered him work answering phones and selling souvenirs. Colbert accepted and discovered that Second City employees were entitled to take classes at their training center for free. Despite his earlier aversion to the comedy group, he signed up for improvisation classes and enjoyed the experience greatly.|$|E
