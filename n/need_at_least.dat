5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1942–43, the Finnish Defence Forces {{estimated}} {{there was no immediate}} prospect of a quick end to the Continuation War but there was an immediate need for new vehicles. In the longer term, the army was expected to <b>need</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 7,000 lorries and buses. Neutral countries such as Sweden and Switzerland were willing to sell vehicles to Finland but demanded payment in advance and in their own currencies. As Finland did not have sufficient currency reserves the only option was to develop domestic vehicle production.|$|E
5|$|Henry's 2006–07 {{season was}} marred by injuries. Although he scored 10 goals in 17 {{domestic}} appearances for Arsenal, Henry's season was cut short in February. Having missed games due to hamstring, foot, and back problems, he was deemed fit enough to come on as a late substitute against PSV in a Champions League match, but began limping shortly after coming on. Scans the next day revealed that he would <b>need</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> three months to heal from new groin and stomach injuries, missing {{the rest of the}} 2006–07 season. Wenger attributed Henry's injuries to a protracted 2005–06 campaign, and reiterated that Henry was keen on staying with the Gunners to rebuild for the 2007–08 season.|$|E
5|$|Historically, many {{prospective}} Australian uranium mines {{have been}} constrained by active antinuclear opposition, but state governments have now approved mine development in Western Australia and Queensland. But {{it is unlikely}} that any new projects will enter active development until the market improves. As of 2013 uranium prices are very low. Cameco placed the Kintyre project on hold until market prices improve and Paladin has stated that its project proposals (Bigrlyi, Angela/Pamela, Manyingee, Oobagooma, and Valhalla/Skal) need higher uranium market prices before they can proceed. Toro wants to take the Wiluna proposal to the development phase, but has not been successful in attracting equity investors. When market prices go up again, so that mine development is justified, most projects would <b>need</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> five years to proceed to production.|$|E

5|$|Later on, {{being told}} by his brother, Jerome, of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British {{officers}} at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would <b>need</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> two days to recover and would {{be dealt with by}} Grouchy. Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at Le Caillou had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Blücher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.|$|E
5|$|Precipitation, {{especially}} rain, has {{a dramatic}} effect on agriculture. All plants <b>need</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> some water to survive, therefore rain (being {{the most effective}} means of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants, {{too much or too little}} rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to crops. Drought can kill crops and increase erosion, while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth. Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, certain cacti require small amounts of water, while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese forces, however, {{were also}} {{suffering}} from logistics problems and exhaustion after their earlier victories. Arguing against the Third Phase Campaign on December 7, PVA Commander Peng Dehuai telegraphed to Mao that the PVA would <b>need</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> {{three months to}} replace its casualties, while most of its troops were in critical need of resupply, rest and reorganization. The Chinese logistics system, {{which was based on}} the concept of People's War with the native population supplying the army, also ran into difficulties due to the indifferent, and sometimes hostile, Korean population near the 38th parallel. The Chinese were now suffering from hunger and the lack of winter clothing.|$|E

5|$|The offer, {{representing}} a 46 percent premium over the stocks selling price at the time, {{came as a}} surprise to Burger King CEO John Chidsey. The proposed sale was expected to help the company repair its fundamental business structures and continue working to close the gap with McDonald's. Analysts commenting on the transaction stated that 3G will have to invest heavily in the company to help reverse its fortunes. David Palmer from UBS stated the company will need to work with its large group of franchise owners to brighten its locations and stabilize sales which could take several years and require significant reinvestment, while Steve West of Stifel Nicolaus stated that Burger King will <b>need</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> a year to right its fundamentals.|$|E
5|$|While New World Cabernets are {{characterized}} as being drinkable earlier than Bordeaux, premium producers {{such as the}} Californian cult wines will produce wines that need time to age and could potentially develop {{for two to three}} decades. Overall, the majority of Californian Cabernets are meant to be approachable after only a couple of years in the bottle but can still have the potential to improve further over time. Similarly many premium Australian Cabernet will also <b>need</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> ten years to develop though many are approachable after two to five years. New Zealand wines are typically meant to be consumed young and will often maintain their green herbal flavors even with extended bottle aging. South American Cabernets have very pronounced fruit flavors when they are young and the best made examples will maintain some of those flavors as they age. South African wines tend to favor more Old World styles and typically require six to eight years' aging before they start to develop further flavors.|$|E

25|$|Computational {{complexity}} (worst, {{average and}} best behavior) {{in terms of}} the size of the list (n). For typical serial sorting algorithms good behavior is O(nlogn), with parallel sort in O(log2n), and bad behavior is O(n2). (See Big O notation.) Ideal behavior for a serial sort is O(n), but this is not possible in the average case. Optimal parallel sorting is O(logn). Comparison-based sorting algorithms <b>need</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> Ω(nlogn) comparisons for most inputs.|$|E

25|$|Less fissile fuel needed. Because LFTRs are thermal {{spectrum}} reactors, they need much less fissile fuel to get started. Only 1-2 tons of fissile {{are required to}} start up a single fluid LFTR, and potentially as low as 0.4 ton for a two fluid design. In comparison, solid fueled fast breeder reactors <b>need</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 8 tons of fissile fuel to start the reactor. While fast reactors can theoretically start up very well on the transuranic waste, their high fissile fuel startup makes this very expensive.|$|E
25|$|The {{quantization}} of {{the volume}} proceeds {{the same way as}} with the area. As we take the derivative, and each time we do so we bring down the tangent vector , when the volume operator acts on non-intersecting Wilson loops the result vanishes. Quantum states with non-zero volume must therefore involve intersections. Given that the anti-symmetric summation is taken over in the formula for the volume we would <b>need</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> intersections with three non-coplanar lines. Actually it turns out that one needs at least four-valent vertices for the volume operator to be non-vanishing.|$|E

Environmental assessment of archaeological sites will also require that environmental conditions (water chemistry, dynamic properties) as well as the natural organisms present on the site are recorded. For shipwrecks, particularly post-industrial age shipwrecks, pollution threats from wreck material may need to be investigated and recorded.|$|E
