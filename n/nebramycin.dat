40|$|The {{penetration}} of tobramycin sulfate (<b>nebramycin</b> factor 6) into normal {{lower respiratory tract}} secretions was studied in a dog model. After a 1. 7 mg/kg intravenous dose of tobramycin, the antibiotic was detected promptly in bronchial secretions, but the peak bronchial secretion concentration was not usually reached until 2 h after injection (mean level 1. 15 μg/ml). The maximum tobramycin concentration in bronchial fluids was equal to the mean inhibitory concentrations that have been reported for about 80 % of Pseudomonas isolates...|$|E
40|$|Tobramycin (<b>nebramycin</b> factor 6) is an {{aminoglycoside}} antibiotic {{active in}} vitro against many gram-negative species and Staphylococcus aureus. The susceptibility of 191 recently isolated pathogenic bacteria to tobramycin {{was measured by}} both a routine broth dilution procedure and the FDA standardized disc technique using a 10 -μg disc. Twenty-five isolates each of Escherichia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, indole-negative Proteus, Pseudomonas, Serratia, and S. aureus, and 16 isolates of group D enterococci were tested. The greatest activity was seen with S. aureus and Pseudomonas species; nearly all isolates of both were inhibited by 0. 20 μg or less per ml. Tobramycin was slightly less active against Klebsiella and Enterobacter and moderately active against Escherichia and Proteus, with most isolates of these genera being inhibited by 1. 56 μg/ml. Neither Serratia nor the enterococci were particularly susceptible. Correlations between zones of inhibition around the 10 -μg disc and minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined, and a zone diameter of 16 mm was recommended as the critical point for prediction of susceptibility...|$|E
40|$|Tobramycin (factor 6 of the <b>nebramycin</b> complex) {{is a new}} {{aminoglycoside}} antibiotic {{isolated from}} Streptomyces tenebrarius which is active against S. aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Susceptibility to tobramycin of 96 strains of P. aeruginosa, including 45 recent isolates from blood, was studied by using agar and broth dilution methods. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for 83 of 96 strains was 3. 12 μg/ml or lower in Mueller Hinton agar; MIC values were two to eight times lower in Mueller Hinton broth tests. Agar dilution MIC values were generally lower than those obtained in parallel tests with gentamicin. Killing curves obtained from serial sampling of broth cultures showed a 100 - to 10, 000 -fold decline in viability of log-phase organisms within 30 min {{of exposure to the}} drug. Two-dimensional agar dilution tests with carbenicillin and tobramycin with 79 strains showed additive or synergistic effects; no antagonism was documented. Seventy-eight of 79 strains were inhibited by a combination of 50 μg of carbenicillin per ml and 1. 56 μg of tobramycin per ml, blood levels which seem attainable in man. Tobramycin appears to be a potent, rapidly bactericidal antibiotic against P. aeruginosa and merits clinical evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Broth {{dilution}} susceptibility {{tests of}} 100 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 101 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus against tobramycin (formerly <b>nebramycin</b> factor 6) and gentamicin showed that tobramycin {{was more effective}} against P. aeruginosa and less effective against S. aureus. The minimal inhibitory concentration of tobramycin against the Pseudomonas sp. isolates that required 5 μg of gentamicin per ml for inhibition ranged from 0. 63 to 0. 31 μg/ml. Peak concentrations {{in the blood of}} 10 healthy adults after intramuscular injection of 80 and 40 mg of tobramycin averaged 3. 7 ± 0. 62 and 2. 4 ± 0. 27 μg/ml, and declined to 0. 56 ± 0. 05 and 0. 26 ± 0. 02 μg/ml, respectively, after 6 h. The urine recovery averaged 60 %. The half-life was 1. 6 h. During continuous intravenous infusion of tobramycin and gentamicin (infusion rate 6. 6 mg per h), blood levels at steady state were 0. 94 ± 0. 10 and 1. 04 ± 0. 06 μg/ml, respectively. For both antibiotics, the calculated distribution volume ranged from 15 to 17 liters. The renal clearance to tobramycin averaged 76 % and that of gentamicin averaged 85 % of the total clearance, indicating that the drugs are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. The present results suggest that tobramycin may be more successful in the treatment of Pseudomonas infections than gentamicin at the same dosage (80 mg intramuscularly three to four times daily) ...|$|E
