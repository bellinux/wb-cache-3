40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedIndonesia, the largest archipelagic {{country with a}} population the fourth biggest in the world, {{is now in the}} process of development. It needs a large quantity of energy electricity to meet the industrial and household demands. The currently available generating capacity is not sufficient to meet the electricity demand for the rapidly growing industries and the increasing population.

40|$|The {{historical}} {{development of the}} civil nuclear power generation industry is examined {{in the light of}} the need to meet conflicting energy-supply and environmental pressures over recent decades. It is suggested that fission (thermal and fast) reactors will dominate the market up to the period 2010 - 2030, with fusion being relegated to the latter part of the twenty-first century. A number of issues affecting the use of <b>nuclear</b> <b>electricity</b> generation in Western Europe are considered, including its cost, industrial strategy needs, and the public acceptability of nuclear power. The contribution of nuclear power stations to achieving CO 2 targets aimed at relieving global warming is discussed in the context of alternative strategies for sustainable development, including renewable energy sources and energy-efficiency measures. Trends in the generation of <b>nuclear</b> <b>electricity</b> from fission reactors are finally considered in terms of the main geopolitical groupings that make up the world in the mid- 1990 s. Several recent, but somewhat conflicting, forecasts of the role of nuclear power in the fuel mix to about 2020 are reviewed. It is argued that the only major expansion in generating capacity will take place on the Asia-Pacific Rim and not in the developing countries generally. Nevertheless, the global nuclear industry overall will continue to be dominated by a small number of large <b>nuclear</b> <b>electricity</b> generating countries; principally the USA, France and Japan. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this study}} we analyze {{the impact of a}} radical change in <b>nuclear</b> <b>{{electricity}}</b> costs on the optimal electricity generation technology mix (EGTM) and constrain the value of information (VOI) on future nuclear costs. We consider three nuclear cost events and four carbon emissions caps. We develop a two-stage framework for energy-economic model MARKAL to eliminate foresight of future nuclear cost movements. We examine how the EGTM responds to these movements under alternative caps and analyze how these movements affect the cost of each cap. We define the expected savings from perfect foresight (ESPF), an upper bound on the VOI. We found that with current technologies, carbon mitigation that does not rely heavily on <b>nuclear</b> <b>electricity</b> is economically insensible. The Strong Cap is extremely costly because it restricts flexibility to respond to cost signals in choosing among technologies. The ESPF is highest under the Medium Cap by a substantial margin...|$|R

40|$|The Fukushima {{disaster}} has {{lead the}} French government to release novel cost information relative to its <b>nuclear</b> <b>electricity</b> program {{allowing us to}} compute a levelized cost. We identify a modest escalation of capital cost and a larger than expected operational cost. Under the best scenario, the cost of French nuclear power {{over the last four}} decades is 59. €/MWh (at 2010 prices) while in the worst case it is 83. €/MWh. On the basis of these findings, we estimate the future cost of nuclear power in France to be at least 76. €/MWh and possibly 117. €/MWh. A comparison with the US confirms that French <b>nuclear</b> <b>electricity</b> nevertheless remains cheaper.

40|$|The {{national}} {{governments of the}} European Union (EU) are finding {{it increasingly difficult to}} provide their populations with cheap and reliable sources of electricity. There is a highly controversial technology available within the EU which could overcome this problem – <b>nuclear</b> generated <b>electricity.</b> The {{purpose of this article is}} to question the extent to which it is possible to reconcile the views of those citizens who object to the use of <b>nuclear</b> <b>electricity</b> with views of those who support the use of <b>nuclear</b> <b>electricity</b> as a competitive, sustainable and secure electricity supply within an open and competitive European energy market. Design/methodology/approach – This article adopts an inter-disciplinary approach to the analysis of the issues. Findings – Political, economic and environmental pressures are combining to constrain the opportunities for {{national governments}} to enable citizens’ preferences with regard to the nuclear sector to be maintained. What is argued in the article is that all the tools which are available to the EU to overcome any lack of democratic decision making in the nuclear sector must be utilised to their full potential, including the legal framework provided by the often overlooked EURATOM Treaty.
