5|$|Poe {{traveled}} to West Point and matriculated as a cadet on July 1, 1830. In October 1830, John Allan married {{his second wife}} Louisa Patterson. The marriage and bitter quarrels with Poe over the children born to Allan out of affairs led to the foster father finally disowning Poe. Poe decided to leave West Point by purposely getting court-martialed. On February 8, 1831, he was tried for gross <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> and disobedience of orders for refusing to attend formations, classes, or church. Poe tactically {{pleaded not guilty to}} induce dismissal, knowing that he would be found guilty.|$|E

25|$|Hull was court-martialed at a trial {{presided over}} by General Henry Dearborn.

Subsequently, two more petitions were filed with Snyder County Court, to remove Midd-West Board President Victor Abate and director Ronald Wilson for <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty.</b> In March 2014, School Board member Scott Norman resigned after three months on the Midd-West School Board.

The petition against board member Nancy Kroh was also dismissed by the judge.|$|E

The ombudsman said that Gatchalian, Padayao, Carreon, and Avendan were liable for issuing business permits to Kentex Manufacturing Corp. in 2015 despite its delinquent status. On his part, Gatchalian has already secured a temporary restraining order (TRO) from the Court of Appeals against the dismissal order by the Ombudsman. He also said that, if the order will be implemented, it will have a chilling effect on mayors from the highly urbanized cities who issue provisional business permits to establishments.|$|E
25|$|Challinger {{records that}} Pearse was awarded his Military Medal {{in the field}} by General Sir William Birdwood but {{that at the time}} Birdwood had run out of medals and {{decorated}} Pearse with a strip of medal ribbon. Challinger also references Pearse's army record which quite apart from his awards for valour includes entries for <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty,</b> absence from guard and disobedience to orders. He was promoted to lance corporal on 21 November 1917, and to corporal on 10 April 1918. He was wounded in action for a second time on 19 May 1918. He subsequently returned to England to recover, but did not return to his unit {{until the end of the}} war. After undergoing training at the Machine Gun Depot, he was posted the 1st Machine Gun Battalion on 1 December 1918.|$|E
25|$|Bonar Law {{then took}} the {{resolution}} to Asquith, who had, unusually, broken his weekend at Walmer Castle to return to Downing Street. At their meeting, Bonar Law sought to convey the content of his colleagues' earlier discussion but failed to produce the resolution itself. That it was never actually shown to Asquith is incontrovertible, and Asquith confirmed this in his writings. Bonar Law's motives in not handing it over are more controversial. Law himself maintained he simply forgot. Jenkins charges him with bad faith, or <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty.</b> Adams suggests Law's motives were more complex—the resolution also contained a clause condemning {{the involvement of the}} press—prompted by the Reynold's News story of that morning—and that, in continuing to seek an accommodation between Asquith and Lloyd George, Law felt it prudent not to share the actual text.|$|E

50|$|A {{business}} prohibition is {{a prohibition}} issued {{by a court}} that prohibits an individual from holding a position of responsibility in a corporation. Business prohibitions are given as punishments and as preemptive measures following aggravated offences while in office, such as false accounting, or gross <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties.</b> The objective is to ascertain public trust in corporations: if the offender's actions are liable to damage the trust of debtors, partners or other parties of contracts, a business prohibition is issued.|$|R

Due to his injuries, Benbow passed to Whetstone the role of presiding over the court, but he {{was present at the}} trial.

500|$|Consequently, Delegate Don Dwyer {{introduced}} {{a resolution to}} impeach Judge Murdock in 2006, alleging [...] "misbehavior in office, [...] <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty,</b> and incompetency" [...] for her trial court decision; in 2007, he {{introduced a}} law that would ban discussion of same-sex unions in public schools. One lawmaker said [...] "It is a clear attempt to intimidate judges and to make the judiciary subservient to the legislature," [...] and Michael Conroy, former President of the Maryland State Bar Association, said that [...] "No basis in fact or law exists to support any suggestion to impeach Murdock for her recent decision on same-sex marriage." [...] David Rocah, an attorney for the ACLU, called the resolution [...] "a frivolous, dangerous and extremist response from the lunatic fringe." [...] Both of the measures failed to pass through committee.|$|E
5000|$|As 22nd Lord Bishop of Down and Connor, Dr. Denvir {{is noted}} for {{emphasizing}} {{the teaching of}} the Catechism to youth as well as emphasizing the importance of scripture to the diocese. [...] In 1841 he helped fund the construction of St Malachy's Church in Belfast, which was completed in 1845. [...] In his later years, Denvir fell under criticism by other Belfast Catholics, who claimed Denvir was <b>neglecting</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties,</b> especially those relating to expanding and defending Catholicism in the face of growing Protestant influence. Some accounts attribute Denvir's shortcomings to poor health and temperament, while others suggest that Denvir backed away from expansion to avoid conflict with Protestant groups.|$|R

500|$|Although Continental Congress President John Hancock praised Hopkins for the fleet's performance, {{its failure}} to capture Glasgow gave opponents of the Navy {{in and out of}} Congress {{opportunities}} for criticism.

Abraham Whipple, captain of Columbus, endured rumours and accusations of cowardice for a time, but eventually asked for a court-martial to clear his name. Held on 6 May by a panel consisting of officers who had been on the cruise, he was cleared of cowardice, although he was criticised for errors of judgment.

500|$|Babcock's brother Manley enlisted after John {{and served}} with the {{engineers}} as a sapper. Manley suffered a nervous breakdown after the war. This, in Babcock's eyes, {{was one of many}} psychological problems that occurred during and after the war. He recalls at least one instance where a soldier shot himself with a [...]45 after his comrades discovered that he had emigrated from Germany, while another ran himself through with a bayonet after a pack drill. Babcock also recounted the importance of honesty in the Canadian Army. In one case, one of his comrades stole a dollar watch and received nine months in prison and Babcock cites that {{as an example of the}} strict discipline in the military structure. By March 1918 he had been promoted to acting corporal, but was reduced to the rank of private for <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty.</b> By October of that year, however, he had been restored to acting lance corporal. Soldiers holding acting ranks in the Canadian forces receive the salary and allowances of the rank, but can be restored to a previous rank at any time due to their lack of the necessary training or experience to hold that position permanently. In Canada during wartime, individuals could be promoted to acting ranks in order to meet service requirements.|$|E

[...] She did not give evidence but was awarded custody of Alexis and $200 a month in child support. She left Wichita as soon as Alexis was returned to her. Her reunion with her daughter was uncertain to the last, as Hubbard had second thoughts about letting her go as he drove Northrup and Alexis to the local airport. She persuaded him that the compulsion instilled by the communists would be dissipated by going ahead with the flight: [...] "Well, I have to follow their dictates. I'll just go to the airplane." [...] She was so desperate to leave by the time she got to the airport that she left behind her daughter's clothes and her own suitcase and one of Alexis's shoes fell off as she dashed to the plane.

However, al-Muzaffar Hajji's interest in pigeons became another source of frustration with the senior emirs. They were particularly bothered by his frequent distribution of high sums in gold and pearls to pigeon racers and his high-stakes bets.

50|$|General Keinonen was {{the only}} Chief of Defence {{to be forced to}} resign in-term. When he was {{selected}} for the position, his formal qualifications were excellent, and he was unambiguously supported by President Kekkonen. A contemporary, Lieutenant Colonel Tiilikainen, devotes an entire chapter to the reasons why he resigned in his book about the Cold War in Finland. Officially, the explanation was <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties,</b> working only an estimated 90 days annually. However, there was widespread resentment against him, both in the forces and later revealed in other memoirs from other generals. This hints towards a more serious accusation, defeatism. Namely, Tiilikainen speculates that due to the YYA Treaty, Keinonen believed that a Soviet occupation was eventually inevitable. Thus, the remaining task of the Chief of Defence was {{to be some sort of}} a Finnish General Philippe Pétain, doing only damage control, and thus active defence planning was unnecessary.|$|R
