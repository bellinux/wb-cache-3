Although a local Communist revolutionary organization was established in Xinjiang in 1921, the area also served as a refuge for many intellectuals fleeing the advent of Soviet Communism in Central Asia, which formed a division within the Xinjiang Turkic nationalist movement.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis examines the historical roots and significance ofTurkey‘s decades-long struggle with terrorism. It argues that current perceptions of terrorism inTurkey {{are due to}} historical challenges to the country‘s territorial sovereignty. These challenges {{are rooted in the}} aborted Treaty of Sèvres at the end of World War I. Framed as a historical survey, this thesis concludes that terrorism inTurkey has been perceived {{as a threat to the}} territorial integrity of the state due to the legacy of territorial loss during the end of the Ottoman Empire and the <b>nationalist</b> <b>separatist</b> <b>movements</b> during the early Republican period. Although significantly different from early separatist movements, the threats posed by the Kurdistan Workers‘ Party (PKK) and the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) have been interpreted as an outgrowth of the irredentism and imperialism embedded in the Treaty of Sèvres. AsTurkey encounters new threats from religiously-motivated terrorism, policymakers continue to view separatist terror as the foremost threat and a continuation of this historical trend.

25|$|From 1985 onwards, {{the last}} Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, {{who sought to}} enact liberal reforms in the Soviet system, {{introduced}} the policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) {{in an attempt to}} end the period of economic stagnation and to democratise the government. This, however, led to the rise of strong <b>nationalist</b> and <b>separatist</b> <b>movements.</b> Prior to 1991, the Soviet economy was the second largest in the world, but during its last years it was afflicted by shortages of goods in grocery stores, huge budget deficits, and explosive growth in the money supply leading to inflation.|$|R

MacDonald, however, finds it fascinating that these women who have chosen to participate in violence used the same terms of condemnation raised against them in describing women interrogators. One ETA woman states, [...] "I cannot comprehend how they can live with themselves," [...] in regards to women torturers.|$|R

On the {{contrary}} of the remaining three movements, FLEC did not fought for the independente of the whole Angola, but only for the independence of Cabinda, which it considered a separate country. Although its activities started still before the withdrawal of Portugal from Angola, the military actions of FLEC occurred mainly after, being aimed against the Angolan armed and security forces. FLEC is the only of the <b>nationalist</b> and <b>separatist</b> <b>movements</b> that still maintains a guerrilla warfare until today.|$|R
2500|$|With {{the rise}} of strong <b>nationalist</b> and <b>separatist</b> <b>movements</b> inside the USSR's republics, Gorbachev tried to avert a {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in the post-Cold War era. A March 1991 referendum, boycotted by some republics, resulted in a majority of participating citizens voting in favor of preserving the union as a renewed federation. Gorbachev's power was greatly diminished after Russian President Boris Yeltsin played a high-profile role in facing down an abortive August 1991 coup d'état attempted by Communist Party hardliners. On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned and the remaining twelve constituent republics emerged as independent post-Soviet states. The Russian Federation—formerly the Russian SFSR—assumed the Soviet Union's rights and obligations and is recognized as the primary legal successor of the Soviet Union. In summing up the international ramifications of these events, Vladislav Zubok stated: [...] "The collapse of the Soviet empire was an event of epochal geopolitical, military, ideological and economic significance." ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{compares the}} secessionist {{movements}} in Scotland and Catalonia and evaluates the minority nationalist discourse {{by focusing on}} the role of the European Union (EU) in the quest for independence of Scottish and Catalan <b>nationalists.</b> Both <b>separatist</b> <b>movements</b> champion territorial independence from their host states, but favour continued membership of the EU. Given the paradoxical nature of this stance, leaving one union to continue in another, we examine the role the EU plays in the discourse used by the secessionist movements. In order to do so, we carried out a coding exercise, comparing the White Papers produced by the Scottish and Catalan pro-secessionist governments. What we find is that the EU plays a pivotal role in secessionist debates, construed as a Union which affords numerous benefits to smaller countries, as well as providing a framework which not only helps dissipate the negative perceptions of ‘going it alone’, but may even facilitate independence...|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1980s, {{the last}} Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, sought to reform and liberalize the economy through his {{policies}} of glasnost and perestroika. The Cold War ended during his tenure, and in 1989, Soviet satellite states in Eastern Europe overthrew their respective communist governments. This {{led to the}} rise of strong <b>nationalist</b> and <b>separatist</b> <b>movements</b> inside the USSR as well. The government initiated a referendum, boycotted by some Soviet republics, which resulted in the majority of participating citizens voting in favor of preserving the union as a renewed federation.

In an article he contributed to the 11 December 1932 Breiz Atao, Mordrel launched an anti-semitic attack, one aiming to add National-socialist rhetoric to his discourse against French centralism: [...] "Jacobin rime avec Youppin" [...] - translatable as [...] "Jacobin rhymes with Yid". The same year, he conceived the Strollad Ar Gelted Adsavet (SAGA, Party of Risen Celts) and its Nazi-like platform - which included Bretons in the Nordic [...] "master race".|$|R
40|$|International audienceTerritoriality has {{variously}} {{been seen}} in the contexts of space and law (Lefebvre, 1991; Taylor, 1993), behaviourism (Urry, 1985) and power (Sack, 1986; Taylor, 1993) and the like. These conceptions have often dominated the national scale, not least because sovereignty over territory has always {{been at the forefront of}} <b>nationalist</b> and <b>separatist</b> <b>movements.</b> As Taylor (1993) has shown, the establishment and disestablishment of states represent victories for some social groups and defeats for others. Beyond this, we need to understand territoriality at scales of analyses including sub-national and personal levels. As Urry (1985) has commented, one's conception of oneself and one's place in society is subtly merged with one's conception of the spacially limited territory of social interaction. In practice, territorial organisation can be used as an instrument for socialising people into space, as with apartheid social engineering in South Africa and districting in the United States, or in the general organisation of the state. All these become highly questionable when political changes occur as experiences in countries undergoing dramatic socio-political changes, show...|$|R
5|$|The {{communist}} {{movement in}} Cambodia and Vietnam began before World War II with {{the founding of}} the Indochinese Communist Party (ICP), almost exclusively dominated by the Vietnamese, originally meant to fight French colonial rule in Indochina. In 1941, Nguyen Ai Quoc (commonly known by his alias Ho Chi Minh) founded the Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi, or the Viet Minh. When the Japanese were defeated at the end of World War II, he initiated the first Indochinese war of independence against the French. During this time, Vietnamese forces made extensive use of Cambodian territory to transport weapons, supplies, and troops. This relationship lasted throughout the Vietnam War, when Vietnamese communists used Cambodia as a transport route and staging area for attacks on South Vietnam. In 1951, Vietnam guided the establishment of a separate Cambodian communist party, the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party (KPRP), which allied with a <b>nationalist</b> <b>separatist</b> Cambodian <b>movement,</b> the Khmer Serei (Free Khmers), in order to pursue independence. In accordance with the 1954 Geneva Accords negotiating the end of the French domination, newly created communist North Vietnam pulled all of its Viet Minh soldiers and cadres out of Cambodia; however, since the KPRP was staffed primarily by ethnic Vietnamese or Cambodians under its tutelage, approximately 5,000 Communist cadres went with them.|$|R
5000|$|The Washington Post {{said it was}} a [...] "highly unusual decision" [...] on {{the part}} of the U.S. {{government}} to grant political asylum to a journalist critical of Islamabad given Pakistan’s status: a strategic partner in Washington’s war against Islamic terrorism. BBC News said Akbar was a victim of the tough stance taken by the Pakistani government. On November 14, 2011, Mark C. Toner, the State Department spokesman, when asked about Akbar's asylum case, said the United States had raised the issue of the protection of journalists with the Pakistani government. On November 15, a Pakistani journalist asked the State Department spokesman if granting Akbar political asylum meant that the United States had actually accepted the Baloch <b>nationalist</b> and <b>separatist</b> <b>movements</b> and legitimized it. Toner said, [...] "we have broader concerns about the situation there and the freedom of the press in Pakistan". The American University Professor and former Pakistani high commissioner to the United Kingdom Akbar S. Ahmed, while wondering if Pakistan was heading for disaster in Balochistan, defended Akbar's political asylum in the United States saying that a policy of [...] "kill and dump" [...] in Balochistan attributed to the Pakistani security forces was causing fear and terror among the Baloch. Akbar's writings mainly focus on the Baloch nationalist movement, human rights, press freedom, sectarian killings in Pakistan, the war on terror and U.S.-Pakistan relations.|$|R
