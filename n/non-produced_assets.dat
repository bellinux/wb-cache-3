It demonstrates {{the extent to}} which operating surpluses are distributed (for example by dividends) to the owners of the enterprises. Also recorded in this account is the property income received by an owner of a financial asset in return for providing funds to, or putting a tangible <b>non-produced</b> <b>asset</b> at the disposal of, another unit. The receipt by government of taxes on production less subsidies is shown in resources.The resources side of this account includes the components of the income approach to measuring gross domestic product and is the starting point for the quarterly sector accounts. The accounts also include property income recorded as both resources for receipts and uses for payments.The balance of this account is the gross balance of primary income for each sector. If the gross balance of primary income is aggregated across all sectors of the UK economy, the result is gross national income.|$|R
40|$|PublisherTokyoThe {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are to describe {{the problems with the}} current estimates for WiP inventories of cultivated assets in Japan's system of national accounts and to propose an alternative method of dealing with these assets. There is a huge di erence between inventory stock measurement that are compiled according to the 1968 SNA versus the 1993 SNA for Japan's national accounts. This leads to non-negligible di erences for productivity measures when inventories are treated as a capital input. We argue that the 1993 SNA recommendations have been inappropriately introduced in the current production and wealth accounts for Japan and that the current 1993 -SNA version estimates for WiP inventory stocks of cultivated assets (CAWiP) are implausible. As an alternative to the "perpetual inventory method" used for the current estimates for CAWiP, we propose a "realized inventory method" (RIM), where inventory stocks over the past periods are backwardly estimated based on the realized values of cultivated assets to be sold. RIM can provide alternative estimates that we argue are more realistic and can also help with distinguishing CAWiP and non-cultivated biological resources, with the latter being as a <b>non-produced</b> <b>asset,</b> of which the natural growth should not be described in production account...|$|R

Hence when growth is in upswing, it can sustain a boom in land and real property with disinflation in other sectors. We argue that peculiarities of the Japanese banking and financial system resulted in an environment close to this model creating the eighties ‟ puzzle of a bubble accompanied by a low inflation rate.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to give some {{suggestions}} on the treatment of intangible assets in national accounting. Knowledge ("World 3 " in Karl Popper's term) is a sort of environment for human beings. As people more and more come to think that knowledge is an important factor for economic growth, the society comes to believe knowledge is capital. However, it is not easy to treat knowledge as capital. First of all, it is because knowledge creation is not economic production. In this paper, it is proposed that knowledge access should be focused instead. In addition, by drawing attention to striking similarities between expenditures for certain intangible fixed assets and certain work-in-progress-type expenditures, it is suggested that the concept of intangible fixed assets in the 1993 SNA may be better interpreted when you consider them as a special type of work-in-progress.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to examine the concept of {{goodwill}} in the context of national accounting. Goodwill, being originally business accounting concept, was incorporated into the SNA in its 1993 version as a category of intangible <b>non-produced</b> <b>assets,</b> though Japanese national accounts have never included it. The SNA 2008 introduced a composite category called goodwill and marketing assets and included it in the list of non-produced non-financial assets. By recognising that goodwill is just essentially net worth (as a national accounting concept) with the sign reversed, it may be very natural to ask whether it is necessary or not for national accounts. This paper gives an answer to the question negatively and seeks to show that national accountants can deal with business acquisition fully reasonably without the concept. Some facts from business accounting history about the concept may bring insight into problems involved.

40|$|Hedonic Pricing Method (HPM) is {{used for}} {{estimating}} {{the value of a}} commodity or the demand for a commodity. The method has been widely used in real estate and housing market research in the recent past. In this report, Estimation of residential market price by Hedonic Pricing Method due to environmental service is discussed. Environmental services is a concept from the ecological economics literature. Environmental services refer to qualitative functions of natural <b>non-produced</b> <b>assets</b> of land, water and air (including related ecosystem) and their biota, which implies natural environment providing particular important uses or benefits that can be captured under the concept of “services. ” It undertake an examination of use of this methodology in the recent real estate and housing literature in the preparation of housing predictive model. The idea behind the HRM is that the commodities are characterized by their constitute properties, hence the value of a commodity can be calculated by adding up the estimated values of its separate properties. Data required that influences the residential property rates will be collect. ed and are analysed using regression analysis which relates to statistically estimate a function that relates property values to the property characteristics, including the distance to open space. Thus, the effects of different characteristics on price can be estimated. The results can be used to evaluate the variations of property rates for small change in characteristics holding all other characteristics constant. Price prediction model is than prepared...|$|E
40|$|Keywords—Environmental services, Hedonic Pricing method, {{implicit}} price, surrogate goodEnvironmental services {{refer to}} qualitative functions of natural <b>non-produced</b> <b>assets</b> of land, water and air (including related ecosystem) and their biota, which implies natural environment providing particular important uses or benefits {{that can be}} captured under the concept of “services. ” Our objective is to analyze the benefits associated with such environmental services {{in order to make}} them more visible. The hedonic pricing method uses the value of a surrogate good or service to measure the implicit price of a non-market good. The basic idea of the hedonic pricing method is that the price of a market good is related to its characteristics or the services it provides rather than the good itself. This article focuses on assessing residential property rate influenced by environmental services by applying hedonic pricing model. It is most commonly applied to variations in housing prices that reflect the value of local environmental attributes. The paper defines Hedonic Pricing method (HPM) and its methodology. Data required that influences the residential property rates will be collected and are analyzed using regression analysis which relates to statistically estimate a function that relates property values to the property characteristics, including the distance to open space.
