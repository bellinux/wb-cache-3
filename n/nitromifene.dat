It {{is a mixture of}} (E)- and (Z)-isomers that possess similar antiestrogenic activity. The drug was described in 1966. Along with tamoxifen, nafoxidine, and clomifene, {{it was one of the}} earliest SERMs.|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} {{contribution of}} androgenic and estrogenic metabolites of testosterone to the activation {{of sexual behavior}} was studied in Japanese quail by using inhibitors of testosterone metabolism, antiestrogens and antiandrogens. These compounds were tested in castrated birds whose sexual behavior had been activated by silastic implants of testosterone (T) or daily injections of testosterone propionate (TP) or diethylstilboestrol (DES). The aromatase inhibitor ATD only depressed T-induced behavior when injected at high doses and the 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, 4 MA was inactive in this respect. The antiestrogens, tamoxifen (TAM) and <b>nitromifene</b> citrate (CI- 628) strongly depressed sexual behavior but they also drastically reduced the crowing behavior which is typically androgen-dependent which throws some doubts on the specificity of their action. The antiandrogens, flutamide and cyproterone acetate (CA), only had limited inhibitory effects on the copulatory behavior but similarly decreased only marginally the crowing. As they strongly depressed the cloacal gland growth, it can be ascertained that they were injected in sufficient amounts and their lack of action on crowing questions the ability of these compounds to inhibit brain processes {{even when they are}} androgen-dependent. Taken together with the results of previous experiments which tested the behavioral effects of the testosterone metabolites, the present data confirm the implication of both androgenic and estrogenic metabolites of testosterone in the activation of behavior. Their interaction remains, however, poorly defined and its understanding will probably require the identification of the biochemical processes which in the brain mediate the behavior.
