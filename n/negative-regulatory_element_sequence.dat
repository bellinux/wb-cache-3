40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown by our laboratory that OTK 18, a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -inducible zinc-finger protein, reduces progeny-virion production in infected human macrophages. OTK 18 antiviral activity is mediated through suppression of Tat-induced HIV- 1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter activity. Through the use of LTR scanning mutant vectors, the specific regions responsible for OTK 18 -mediated LTR suppression have been defined. Two different LTR regions were identifi ed as potential OTK 18 -binding sites by an enhanced DNA–transcription factor ELISA system; the <b>negative-regulatory</b> <b>element</b> (NRE) at – 255 /– 238 and the Ets-binding site (EBS) at – 150 /– 139 in the LTR. In addition, deletion of the EBS in the LTR blocked OTK 18 -mediated LTR suppression. These data indicate that OTK 18 suppresses LTR activity through two distinct regulatory elements. Spontaneous mutations in these regions might enable HIV- 1 to escape from OTK 18 antiretroviral activity in human macrophages...|$|R

In order to elucidate whether cattle UCP 3 can be regulated by muscle-related factors, deletion of cattle UCP 3 promoter was amplified and cloned into pGL 3 -basic, pGL 3 -promoter and PEGFP-N 3 vector, respectively, then transfected into C 2 C 12 myoblasts cells and UCP 3 promoter activity was measured using the dual-Luciferase reporter assay system. The results showed that there is some <b>negative-regulatory</b> <b>element</b> from − 620 to − 433 bp, and there is some positive-regulatory element between − 433 and − 385 bp. The fragment (1. 08 kb) of UCP 3 promoter was cotransfected with muscle-related transcription factor myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) and myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2 A (MEF 2 A). We found that UCP 3 promoter could be upregulated by Myf 5, Myf 6 and MyoD and downregulated by MyoG and MEF 2 A...|$|R

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{basis for the}} low level expression of three alleles of the maize waxy (Wx) gene has been described. Each allele contains a retrotransposon in intron sequences. These insertions represent previously undescribed elements, and their association with three wx alleles indicates that retrotransposon elements are important agents of spontaneous mutation in maize. For each allele, <b>element</b> <b>sequences</b> are spliced from pre-mRNA with the surrounding intron even though the insertions increase intron length by approximately 40 - to 60 -fold. In addition, despite differences in <b>element</b> <b>sequences,</b> insertion sites, and relative orientations, each element disrupts long-range splice site recognition leading to novel Wx transcripts where exons both upstream and downstream of the insertion site are skipped.

40|$|Expression of {{a number}} of genes during {{cellular}} differentiation is controlled at the level of transcription. Cell type- and time-specific patterns of gene transcription result from the interaction between cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors. In order to understand the molecular mechanisms of gene expression at the level of transcription, the regulatory region of the glutamine synthetase (GS) gene was investigated using both functional and binding analyses. GS expression increases more than 100 -fold during differentiation of 3 T 3 -L 1 cells into adipocytes. Recently, Hadden et al. (Nucleic Acid Research, 25 : 3930 - 3936, 1997) identified the regulatory regions of the mouse GS gene in the first intron and the distal 52 ̆ 7 -flanking <b>sequence.</b> These two <b>elements</b> function cooperatively to regulate GS transcription during adipocyte differentiation. In my studies, I identified a putative 32 bp enhancer as well as a closely associated silencer in the first intron of the GS gene. This was accomplished by electrophoretic mobility shift analyses (EMSA) and functional analyses of stably transfected fusion genes composed of putative regulatory elements alone or in combination. To identify putative transcription factors, EMSA included the use of wild type and mutant oligonucleotides as well as the use of antibody directed against known transcription factors. My studies, taken together, revealed the nucleotide sequences required for transcriptional activity and for transcription factor binding to the 32 bp putative enhancer. During functional analyses of fusion genes, I identified a 146 bp intron 1 sequence with both enhancer and silencer activity. This sequence includes the 32 bp enhancer. Moreover, all of the enhancer activity in the 146 bp sequence resides in the 32 bp enhancer while the silencer activity resides in two elements downstream of the 32 bp enhancer. Thus, in concert with the distal 52 ̆ 7 -flanking regulatory element interaction between positive- and <b>negative-regulatory</b> <b>elements</b> in the first intron appears to be required for transcriptional control of the native GS gene during adipocyte differentiation...|$|R
