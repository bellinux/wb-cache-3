40|$|Several {{diseases}} {{that can lead}} to an acute spinal cord lesion were investigated. Demyelinating diseases were ex-cluded by normal cranial MRI and normal CSF examination. Infection myelitis was excluded by the normal CSF examina-tion and <b>negative</b> <b>serologies.</b> Spinal cord compression and tu-mors were excluded by the spinal MRI. Also, the spinal MRI was consistent with infarct diagnosis. Several etiologies of spinal cord infarct were investigated. Aortic and vertebral dissections were excluded by computed tomography angiography. Vasculitis was excluded by normal CSF and negative autoantibodies. There was no risk factor for atherosclerosis. Cervical spine disease was excluded by cervi-cal MRI. There were not triggering movements. The only risk factor found was the PFO. There are two reported cases of spinal cord infarct associ-ated with PFO, one in ASA territory and other in PSA terri-tory, both in the thoracic region. To our knowledge, this is the first case of cervical spinal cord infarct in the ASA territory associated with PFO already described.

40|$|Abstract. During {{the course}} of chronic chagasic infection, low {{parasite}}mia levels prevent parasite detection by current techniques such as hemoculture and xenodiagnosis. Since serologic tests have sensitivity but lack specificity, molecular assays based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been proposed as alternative tools for parasite detection in individuals with chronic Chagas ’ disease. A variable degree of PCR efficiency {{has been reported in}} the literature and illustrates the need for further evaluation of large numbers of chagasic patients. In this study, we compared an optimized PCR technique with hemoculture and complement-mediated lysis (CoML) in 113 individuals from or living in endemic areas of Brazil who had conventional serologic results that were either positive, negative, or inconclusive. The PCR amplification yielded positive results in 83. 5 % (66 of 79) of individuals with positive serology, 47. 6 % (10 of 21) with <b>negative</b> <b>serology,</b> and 46. 2 % (6 of 13) with inconclusive serology. Of 10 patients with <b>negative</b> <b>serology</b> and positive PCR result, eight (80 %) had positive CoML, indicating that they could have been chagasic but were not mounting immune responses. The PCR results were also positive for all individuals who had positive hemoculture, for 37 individuals with negative hemoculture and positive serology, and for two of six individ-uals with inconclusive serology and negative hemoculture. Thirteen individuals living in nonendemic areas who had <b>negative</b> <b>serology</b> were used as a negative control group: 100 % had negative PCR results. Our results show that the optimized PCR protocol used here was very sensitive in detecting the presence of Trypanosoma cruzi in chroni...|$|E

They had determinations of serum antibodies to L. pneumophila serogroups 1 – 6 by indirect immunofluorescence antibody test at the Infectious Diseases Laboratory of University of Louisville (KY, USA) and urinary antigen tests for L. pneumophila serogroup 1.

40|$|Background: The {{diagnosis}} of {{acute respiratory illness}} caused by Hantavirus is based in the rapid and progressive clinical course, epidemiological background and the serological confirmation of the virus. When {{the presence of the}} virus is not confirmed a differential diagnosis must be made with other infections. Between 1999 and 2001, the Chilean Public Health Institute received 1063 blood samples from patients with a suspicious clinical picture, to study the presence of Andes strain of Hantavirus. In 134 of these samples, the presence of the virus was confirmed. Aim: To study the presence of other infections in sera from patients with suspected Hantavirus acute respiratory illness but serologically negative for Hantavirus. Material and methods: A retrospective study of 98 serum samples, received at the National Public Health Institute, of patients with <b>negative</b> <b>serology</b> for Hantavirus. The presence of antibodies against influenza virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Leptospira and Streptococcus pneumoniae was determined using Latex techniques. Results: Leptospira was detected in 23 patients, influenza virus in 13, Streptococcus pneumoniae in six and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in one case. Leptospira infections were confirmed in four cases by ELISA determination of IgM antibodies. Influenza virus infection was confirmed in three cases by Hemmaglutation Inhibition Assay.
