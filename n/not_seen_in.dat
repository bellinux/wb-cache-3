5|$|Fumito Kondō {{considered}} the print revolutionary; such expressive, individualized faces are <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the stereotyped {{figures in the}} works of Utamaro's predecessors such as Harunobu and Kiyonaga, {{and it was the first}} time in ukiyo-e history that the beauties were drawn from the general urban population rather than the pleasure quarters.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the oldest}} and most {{successful}} insect groups, such Endopterygota, use a system of complete metamorphosis. Complete metamorphosis is unique to a group of certain insect orders including Diptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. This form of development is exclusive and <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> any other arthropods.|$|E
5|$|The gaps are <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> {{a simple}} {{snapshot}} of {{the locations of the}} asteroids at any one time because asteroid orbits are elliptical, and many asteroids still cross through the radii corresponding to the gaps. The actual spatial density of asteroids in these gaps does not differ significantly from the neighboring regions.|$|E

5|$|Ermac {{appeared}} in two episodes of the 1996 animated series , voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. He has a minor {{role in the}} 1997 feature film , {{in which he was}} played by assistant stunt coordinator John Medlen and is identified by name only in the closing credits. Though the script and print media publications such as SciFi Entertainment and Black Belt mentioned his telekinetic powers, they were <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the film.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, Archimandrite Porphyrius Uspensky (1804–1885), at {{that time}} head of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem and {{subsequently}} Bishop of Chigirin, visited the monastery and the codex was shown to him, together with leaves which Tischendorf had <b>not</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>In</b> 1846, Captain C. K. MacDonald visited Mount Sinai, saw the codex, and bought two codices (495 and 496) from the monastery.|$|E
5|$|Israel is a 58-year-old New Yorker {{who decided}} he couldn't be gay and Orthodox, {{and turned his}} back on his religion, though not before his family forced him into {{electroshock}} therapy to try to cure him. Now a tour guide in the Haredi neighborhoods of New York, the film follows him as he gives a tour, psychoanalyzes himself and decides, on the 25th anniversary of being with his life partner, to call his 98-year-old father, a rabbi, whom he has <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> over twenty years.|$|E

5|$|It {{is evident}} that the mandibles were highly specialized. Like other Cretaceous ants, Zigrasimecia {{provides}} further evidence that the extinct ant fauna exhibited a great diversity of feeding behavior. The unusual mouthparts of Zigrasimecia are consistent with other extinct species found in Burmese, French, New Jersey and Canadian deposits, which also show morphologies <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> extant ants.|$|E
5|$|Modern cottage gardens include countless {{regional}} and personal variations and embrace plant materials, such as ornamental grasses or native plants <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the rural gardens of cottagers. Traditional roses, with their full fragrance and lush foliage, {{continue to be}} a cottage-garden mainstay — along with modern disease-resistant varieties that retain traditional attributes. Informal climbing plants, whether traditional or modern hybrids, are also common, as are the self-sowing annuals and freely spreading perennials favoured in traditional cottagers' gardens.|$|E
5|$|Mycena maculata bears some {{resemblance}} to M.inclinata, but is only associated with decaying hardwood logs and stumps, and {{is found in}} eastern North America, and sometimes on oak on the West Coast. In age, it develops reddish spots on the gills that are <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> M.inclinata. M.inclinata is often confused with the edible M.galericulata, a common species that is variable in cap color, size and shape. M.galericulata typically has a bluntly conical cap that is dull gray-brown, and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross-veins. M.polygramma has a ridged stem that is bluish-gray.|$|E

5|$|Several {{methods for}} {{identifying}} synthetic diamonds can be performed, {{depending on the}} method of production {{and the color of}} the diamond. CVD diamonds can usually be identified by an orange fluorescence. D-J colored diamonds can be screened through the Swiss Gemmological Institute's Diamond Spotter. Stones in the D-Z color range can be examined through the DiamondSure UV/visible spectrometer, a tool developed by De Beers. Similarly, natural diamonds usually have minor imperfections and flaws, such as inclusions of foreign material, that are <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> synthetic diamonds.|$|E
5|$|The {{last known}} {{observation}} of the frog in the wild {{was that of a}} single male heard calling (but <b>not</b> <b>seen)</b> <b>in</b> 2007. At the time of its last survey in 2009, the IUCN classified E. rabborum as Critically Endangered. More recent estimates deem the species effectively extinct in the wild. A single adult male named Toughie at the Atlanta Botanical Garden was the last known survivor of the species until his death.|$|E
5|$|The nude {{female figure}} is realistically sculpted in high-relief. Her eyes, beneath distinct, joined eyebrows, are hollow, presumably to accept some {{inlaying}} material– a feature common in stone, alabaster, and bronze sculptures of the time, but <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> other Mesopotamian clay sculptures. Her full lips are slightly upturned at the corners. She is {{adorned with a}} four-tiered headdress of horns, topped by a disk. Her head is framed by two braids of hair, with the bulk of {{her hair in a}} bun in the back and two wedge-shaped braids extending onto her breasts.|$|E

5|$|The parasite/host {{relationship}} probably {{drove the}} prevalence of sexual reproduction over the more efficient asexual reproduction. It seems that when a parasite infects a host, sexual reproduction affords {{a better chance of}} developing resistance (through variation in the next generation), giving sexual reproduction variability for fitness <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the asexual reproduction, which produces another generation of the organism susceptible to infection by the same parasite. Coevolution between host and parasite may accordingly be responsible for much of the genetic diversity seen in normal populations, including blood-plasma polymorphism, protein polymorphism, and histocompatibility systems.|$|E
5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} may {{be divided}} into two distinct size classes, small and large, with the large size class being about one and a half times larger than the small class, and the small class being twice as common as the large class. Both size classes lived alongside each other, and while researchers had previously suggested that they represent different species, Christopher Bennett showed that the differences between them are consistent with the concept that they represent females and males, and that Pteranodon species were sexually dimorphic. Skulls from the larger size class preserve large, upward and backward pointing crests, while the crests of the smaller size class are small and triangular. Some larger skulls also show evidence of a second crest that extended long and low, toward the tip of the beak, which is <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> smaller specimens.|$|E
5|$|Another {{element of}} the Vijayanagara style is the carving and consecration of large monoliths such as the Sasivekaalu (mustard) Ganesha and Kadalekaalu (ground nut) Ganesha at Hampi, the Gommateshwara (Bahubali) monoliths in Karkala and Venur, and the Nandi bull in Lepakshi. The Vijayanagara temples of Kolar, Kanakagiri, Sringeri and other towns of Karnataka; the temples of Tadpatri, Lepakshi, Ahobilam, Tirumala Venkateswara Temple and Srikalahasti in Andhra Pradesh; and the temples of Vellore, Kumbakonam, Kanchi and Srirangam in Tamil Nadu are {{examples}} of this style. Vijayanagara art includes wall-paintings such as the Dashavatara and Girijakalyana (marriage of Parvati, Shiva's consort) in the Virupaksha Temple at Hampi, the Shivapurana murals (tales of Shiva) at the Virabhadra temple at Lepakshi, and those at the Kamaakshi and Varadaraja temples at Kanchi. This mingling of the South Indian styles resulted in a richness <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> earlier centuries, a focus on reliefs in addition to sculpture that surpasses that previously in India.|$|E

5|$|Aria of Sorrow {{includes}} additional {{modes of}} play that display elements <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the game's primary scenario. The New Game+ option allows a player that has completed {{the game to}} replay the game with all equipment and souls the player had acquired in a previous file. Additionally, the player can opt to start the game in Hard Mode, offering the same gameplay at a higher difficulty level. Two other modes offer alternatives to the standard gameplay. Boss Rush mode involves the player facing all of the game's bosses in quick succession, and is unlocked after the player completes the game once. Julius Mode is an additional mode of play unlocked with the same method. The player takes control of , the member of the Belmont clan featured in the game.|$|E
5|$|Combat in Mother 3 {{includes}} a unique musical combo system <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> previous Mother games. When {{one of the}} player's characters directly attacks an enemy with a weapon, they can repeatedly attack the enemy by pressing the button {{in time with the}} beat of the background music, with each enemy possessing a musical theme with different rhythms. Using this system, the player can attack the enemy up to sixteen times in a row. When the correct beat is not apparent, the player can put the enemy to sleep to isolate the beat from the music.|$|E
5|$|Early 21st-century research, however, {{suggested}} that Master James' role, and Savoyard influence more generally, {{may have been}} overstated. The stonework of the sites in North Wales is of much higher quality than that in North Italy, and key features – such as the gatehouses – are <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> Savoyard. Research indicates that Master James also appears {{to have had a}} stronger project management function, rather than an architectural design role, {{in the development of the}} sites. Furthermore, in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built only after James had left the region, and would never have been seen by the architect. The similarity in architectural details may, therefore, be the result of the wider role played by Savoy craftsmen and engineers on the projects, rather than that of a single individual.|$|E
