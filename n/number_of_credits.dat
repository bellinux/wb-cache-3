5|$|To {{improve his}} {{academic}} profile, Moore planned to attend American Christian School in Aston, Pennsylvania, {{but a new}} NCAA rule was instituted that limited the number of core classes able to be taken at a prep school. Lacking the required <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> to receive an athletic scholarship, he enrolled at Temple as a non-scholarship student and sat out his freshman year as a redshirt. In his freshman debut the following year, he scored 11points against East Tennessee State. Moore followed that performance up with a double-double of 11points and 10rebounds versus the College of Charleston, and a season-high 13points in a loss to Clemson. As a freshman, Moore averaged 4.5points and 2.3rebounds per game in 13.2minutes of playing time. After his 13th game, he was suspended due to Temple eligibility rules and did not play {{in the remainder of}} the season.|$|E

25|$|Launched in 2003, ATA's {{frequent}} flyer program, ATA Travel Awards, offered one of {{the lowest}} thresholds for earning travel, with the added benefit of allowing reward redemption free of blackout date restrictions. After three roundtrips booked on the company's website, customers earned a coach companion ticket on any flight operated by ATA Airlines throughout the contiguous United States. All tickets booked online received double credit toward that particular trip versus purchasing through a telephone or travel agent. While award availability to Hawaii was very limited, travelers did earn twice the normal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> when they purchased airfare on Hawaii-bound flights.

Most programs also include elective courses and concentrations for further study in a particular area. Most challenging and prestigious MBA concentrations include accounting and finance.

25|$|At German universities, {{students}} enroll for {{a specific}} program of study (Studiengang). During their studies, students can usually choose freely from all courses offered at the university. However, all bachelor's degree programs require a number of particular compulsory courses and all degree programs require a minimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> that must be earned in the core field of the program of study. It {{is not uncommon to}} spend longer than the regular period of study (Regelstudienzeit) at university. There are no fixed classes of students who study and graduate together. Students can change universities according to their interests and the strengths of each university. Sometimes students attend multiple different universities over the course of their studies. This mobility means that at German universities there is a freedom and individuality unknown in the USA, the UK, or France. Professors also choose their subjects for research and teaching freely. This academic freedom is laid down in the German constitution.|$|E

He also lauded the artificial intelligence for being [...] "unpredictable". However, Matthew Kato from Game Informer felt that the weather system was exaggerated, and added that they may take away the fun of some races, and the overhauled career mode, which he described as [...] "somewhere between those in Forza 5 and Forza 4" [...] is not engaging enough for most players. However, he praised the number of cars and tracks featured, {{as well as its}} high replay value. Justin Towell from GamesRadar criticized the game's slow-paced career mode, as he felt that it has failed to deliver an intense experience. He also felt the handling was [...] "odd" [...] and the Drivatar system was [...] "inconsistent". However, he praised the rich content featured, and added that by comparison, Forza 6 makes Forza 5 to look like a game demo instead of a full game.|$|E
