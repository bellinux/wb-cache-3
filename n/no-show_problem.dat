40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} a standard problem in revenue management, the <b>no-show</b> <b>problem,</b> through an explanatory example case scenario. A simulation model is built {{to address the}} problem and then an optimizing component is introduced to fully solve the problem. The basic model is readily extendable to address modeling, statistical and management issues. Teaching experience with the model and its impact is discussed. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND Revenue management has been, and is, a hot area in management science/operations research (MS/OR) since its benefits have clearly been demonstrated by many organizations. For example, Ford’s Lloyd Hansen, controller for global marketing and sales, estimated that between 1995 - 2000, about $ 3 billion growth came from a series of revenue management initiatives (Leibs, S., 2000) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{justified}} {{as a result}} of two factors: (1) general decline of the population of college-aged students predicted for the 19802 ̆ 7 s and 19902 ̆ 7 s and (2) administrative inefficiency experienced by the admissions and instructional staff at Waukesha County Technical Institute (WCTI) in Southeast Wisconsin because of inability to predict which applicants would actually show up to register. The purpose was to bring understanding and control to the <b>no-show</b> <b>problem</b> by creating a model for predicting which applicants to WCTI would likely be no-shows. For purposes of developing a prediction model and a body of information relating to the model, data already available at WCTI were used: information on the application form. Half of the total sample of 300 were application forms from no-show applicants which were randomly chosen from forms on file for the fall semesters in the academic years from 1976 to 1982. Half of the total sample of 300 were application forms randomly selected for applicants who sought admission for the same academic years and who did register. The total random sample of 300 was stratified by program. It was hoped that a set of statistically significant predictor variables could be attained. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. A series of hypotheses were established to determine the independence of the registered/no-show criterion against the independent variables. A matrix of the intercorrelations of the dependent and independent variables was created using point biserial coefficients, phi-coefficients, and contingency coefficients; linear discriminant analysis was used to test Hypothesis 12 (the prediction model). In Hypotheses 1 through 11, chi-square analysis of the correlations required that the null hypotheses be retained at the. 05 level. The chi-square value for the linear discriminant analysis of the Predictor Hypotheses was significant at the. 05 level. The null hypothesis for the Predictor Hypothesis was rejected. However, since all 11 of the predictor variables taken simultaneously accounted for only about. 08 of the variability in the dependent variable, the result of the linear discriminant analysis is of no practical administrative value...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE We {{wanted to}} {{describe}} the methods used by family medicine resi-dency practices with low no-show rates (rate exemplars) and those able to keep visit rates high despite no-shows (management exemplars). METHODS Program directors of US family medicine residency programs {{were asked to respond}} to a survey questionnaire. Telephone interviews were conducted with the administrators of rate exemplars (no-show rates of 10 % or less) and management exemplars (average of 8 to 10 patient visits per half-day plus high administrator satisfaction with no-show management strategies). RESULTS Directors of 14 rate and 8 management exemplars, identifi ed from among the 141 practices (31. 5 %) that returned the initial survey instrument, were interviewed and subsequently resurveyed. All of the rate exemplars used mul-tiple strategies, including patient education, patient reminders, patient sanctions, and some degree of open-access scheduling. Practices that managed no-shows well encouraged walk-ins and work-ins and overbooked resident schedules either equally or based upon individual no-show rates. Practice exemplars of both types were highly committed to addressing the <b>no-shows</b> <b>problem</b> and were dili-gent about following their policies and procedures regarding no-shows. CONCLUSION Some family medicine residency practices are able to achieve low no-show rates or keep them from affecting practice volume. Those that do use combinations of well-established methods.

40|$|Appointment <b>no-shows</b> are a <b>problem</b> in {{healthcare}} organizations. It {{is important that}} appointment intake and scheduling processes are effective in both meeting client needs and efficient in meeting organizational business requirements. This study examined baseline levels of appointment keeping in a not-for-profit medical/behavioral pediatric services clinic, analyzed existing administrative processes, introduced additional appointment keeping reminders, and presented systematic, performance management tutorials for clinic employees. Results indicate an increase in percentage of appointments kept {{and a decrease in}} appointment lag time...|$|R
40|$|Airline revenue {{management}} (ARM) problem focuses on finding a seat allocation policy, {{which results in}} the maximum profit. Overbooking has been receiving significant attention in ARM over the years, since a major loss in revenue results from cancellations and <b>no-shows.</b> Basically, overbooking <b>problem</b> aims at maximizing the profit by minimizing the number of vacant seats. However, this problem is difficult to handle due to the demand and cancellation uncertainties {{and the size of}} the problem. In this study, we propose new models for the static and the dynamic overbooking problems. Due to the complex analytical form of the overbooking problem, in the static case we introduce models that give upper and lower bounds on the optimal expected profit. In the dynamic case, however, we propose a new dynamic programming model, which is based on two streams of arrivals; one for booking and the other one is for cancellation. This approach allows us to come up with a computationally tractable model. We also present numerical results to show the effectiveness of our models...|$|R
