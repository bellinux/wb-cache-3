40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an integrated}} algorithm for full scale {{investigation of the}} earth regeneration effect of solar neutrinos with all three active neutrinos. We illustrate that the earth effect on low energy solar neutrinos (E_ν < 20 MeV) causes large variations in the survival probabilities for large values of the mixing angle θ_ 12 for a given value of θ_ 13. But it is maximal for small values of θ_ 13 and diminishes for large values at a given value of θ_ 12. The <b>nadir</b> <b>angle</b> dependence is sensitive {{to the value of}} E'≡ E/Δ_ 12. As far as low energy solar neutrinos are concerned we notice that the earth effect is more pronounced for core penetration. We confirm that the earth effect leaves the SMA region almost intact regardless of θ_ 13 and that it is significant for high energy ^ 8 B and hep neutrinos in the LMA region. We also show that for large values of θ_ 13, the earth effect is significant for high energy neutrinos (E'≳ 10 ^ 9) and it can be large at any <b>nadir</b> <b>angle.</b> Comment: 8 pages, 2 postscript figure...|$|E

BDS data from global distributed stations operated by the International Monitoring and Assessment System (iGMAS) and the Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) are collected and a new SIMP model as a piece-wise linear function of the <b>nadir</b> <b>angle</b> is released for the IGSO-and MEO-satellite groups and for B 1, B 2 and B 3 frequency band individually. The SIMP of GEO,IGSO and MEO satellites is further analyzed with B 1 /B 2 dual-frequency data onboard the FengYun- 3 C(FY 3 C) satellite at an altitude of~ 830 km, and it showed that, for nadir angles smaller than 7 &# 176;, the SIMP values for GEO is quite close to the IGSO's, especially for B 2, which may suggest that the SIMP model for IGSO satellites possibly also works for GEO satellites. It also demonstrated that, when the <b>nadir</b> <b>angle</b> is smaller than 12 &# 176;for the MEO and 7 &# 176;for the IGSO, the estimated SIMP model with data from FY 3 C is considerable consistent with that estimated with data collected at ground stations. Experiments are carried out to investigate the impacts of the SIMP on wide-lane fractional cycle bias (FCB) estimation for BDS satellites. The result indicates that, with the correction of the estimated SIMP, the repeatability of the FCB series is significantly improved by more than 60 % for all satellites. Specifically, for the MEO and IGSO satellites, the repeatability is smaller than 0. 05 cycle; the repeatability of 0. 023 and 0. 068 cycles achieved for GEO satellites C 01 and C 02 respectively with the estimated SIMP model for IGSO satellites...|$|E

The 1 - 2 mass splitting and mixing lead to the appearance, apart from the resonance MSW peaks, of the parametric resonance peak for core-crossing trajectories at Eν ∼ 0. 2 GeV. We show that the interference effects, in particular CP violation, have a domain structure with borders determined by the solar and atmospheric magic lines and the lines of the interference phase condition.

40|$|We explore {{oscillations}} of {{the solar}} ^ 8 B neutrinos in the Earth in detail. The relative excess of night ν_e events (the Night-Day asymmetry) is computed as function of the neutrino energy and the <b>nadir</b> <b>angle</b> η of its trajectory. The finite energy resolution of the detector causes an important attenuation effect, while the layer-like structure of the Earth density leads to an interesting parametric suppression of the oscillations. Different features of the η- dependence encode information about the structure (such as density jumps) of the Earth density profile; thus measuring the η distribution allows the scanning of {{the interior of the}} Earth. We estimate the sensitivity of the DUNE experiment to such measurements. About 75 neutrino events are expected per day in 40 kt. For high values of Δ m^ 2 _ 21 and E_ν > 11 MeV, the corresponding D-N asymmetry is about 4 % and can be measured with 15 % accuracy after 5 years of data taking.

40|$|The Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) {{scanning}} radiometer is planned as the Earth radiation budget instrument for the Earth Observation System, to be flown {{in the late}} 1990 's. In order to minimize the spatial sampling errors of the measurements, {{it is necessary to}} select design parameters for the instrument such that the resulting point spread function will minimize spatial sampling errors. These errors are described as aliasing and blurring errors. Aliasing errors are due to presence in the measurements of spatial frequencies beyond the Nyquist frequency, and blurring errors are due to attenuation of frequencies below the Nyquist frequency. The design parameters include pixel shape and dimensions, sampling rate, scan period, and time constants of the measurements. For a satellite-borne {{scanning radiometer}}, the pixel footprint grows quickly at large <b>nadir</b> <b>angles.</b> The aliasing errors thus decrease with increasing scan angle, but the blurring errors grow quickly.

40|$|A basic {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the applicability of medium-resolution satellite radiation measurements to assessments of the diabatic heating and cooling within the atmosphere. Data from portions of TIROS I 11 orbital passes in mid-July 1961 and concurrent conventional data were examined over a 4 -by- 4 -degree grid scale. Computations, appropriate to analyzed cloud conditions for each grid block, included the outgoing long-wave flux, the infrared radiational cooling, the t,otal radiational cooling (including solar absorption in the atmosphere), and the total potential energy. In addition, simple relative estimates were made of the latent heat released and the average boundary heat flus into the atmosphere. Results show that, for <b>nadir</b> <b>angles</b> less than about 45 deg., the unaltered Channel 2 temperature is proportional to the computed outgoing long-wave flux and is related to the average cloudiness in each grid block. The Channel 2 temperature has a higher positive correlation with the total radiational cooling (long-wave and short-wave) in the atmosphere than with the long-wave cooling alone. The relative heating from the distributions of net radiation and precipitation are correlated in the same sense to the Channel 2 temperature, but the relative boundary heat flux is correlated in the opposite sense. Unaltered Channel 3 fluxes show a general relationship to atmospheric solar absorption rates and to a cloudiness parameter for the grid scale. Some slight generation of eddy potential energy was suggested by the analyses of the differential diabatic cooling. 1...|$|R
