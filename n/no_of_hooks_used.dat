In both acanthocephalan sexes, the fully everted cylindrical proboscis possessed 18 longitudinal rows <b>of</b> <b>hooks</b> with 18 hooks per row (rarely 19 - 20). Hook length varied according to position on the proboscis; apical hooks were 40 - 52 µm long, middle hooks were 31. 7 - 36. 6 µm and basal hooks were 38. 1 - 40 µm. Starting from the anterior end of the metasoma, numerous cuticular spines (26. 7 - 30 µm in length) were visible and their number progressively decreased posteriorly. SEM observations <b>of</b> D. truttae <b>hooks</b> and spines revealed the presence of many surface striations on each proboscis hook. These surface striations were absent from trunk spines. From the base <b>of</b> the <b>hook,</b> the striations ran parallel toward the point of convergence. Additionally, survey of longitudinal and transversal sections <b>of</b> the <b>hook</b> <b>using</b> transmission {{electron microscope}} (TEM) confirmed that the hook surface was not smooth. SEM comparison with the <b>hooks</b> <b>of</b> several palaeacanthocephalan species, {{as well as with}} the <b>hooks</b> <b>of</b> species belonging to Eoacanthocephala and Polyacanthocephala, indicated that the striations are currently exclusive to D. truttae proboscis hooks...|$|R
40|$|Hook ups are sexual {{encounters}} that can include {{a variety of}} behaviours (e. g., kissing to intercourse) with <b>no</b> expectation <b>of</b> future contact or a committed relationship.

Whereas both analytic techniques produced similar results, survival analysis provided a more complete picture by showing an increase in the rate <b>of</b> <b>hooking</b> up that peaked between spring semester of the first year of college and autumn semester of the second year of college, followed by a gradual decline in hook up rates over subsequent semesters. Findings indicate that gender is significantly related to hooking up in the logistic regression analysis, with women reporting fewer hook ups; however, gender was not significantly related to hooking up in the survival analysis, indicating that there are no differences in the pattern across cohorts.

40|$|Three types <b>of</b> <b>hooks</b> and baits {{were tested}} on two {{swordfish}} longliners {{over a period}} of 480 days at sea in five zones of the North and South Atlantic Ocean. Nominal CPUE data would suggest that the overall catch rates in weight of the fish species in general were reduced with the alternate hooks and baits tested. Overall rates (+ 7 % and – 8 %) and (+ 3 % and – 11 %) were found for the swordfish and blue shark, respectively in relation to the hook and bait combination of reference. The shortfin mako exhibited substantial decreases (– 9 % and – 61 %). For the billfish group, however, the all rates underwent an increase (+ 7 % and + 49 %). For the sea turtle species CAT (Caretta caretta) and LOL (Lepidochelys olivacea), the nominal catch rates <b>using</b> alternate <b>hooks</b> and baits tested were generally found to increase (+ 2 %, + 557 %) and (+ 203 %, – 66 %), respectively. Standardized log normal CPUEs showed that “zone” was the most important significant factor explaining the variability in the CPUE of all the species. “Hook type” was only significant in the billfish group, while “bait type” proved to be significant for the shortfinmako, several other fish and the sea turtleC. caretta. The interaction between bait and other factors were also significant for some species. The mean standardized CPUE data also suggest that the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> alternative <b>hooks</b> could cause variations in the CPUE of swordfish (+ 14 % and – 11 %) {{depending on the type of}} bait combined. The circle hook would lead to losses for this species (– 11 % and – 1 %) depending on the type of bait combined. A comparison of the standardized CPUEs would suggest that changing the hook and maintaining the same type of bait could result in an increase in the level of sea turtles by-catch that become hookedin external or internal locations. The use of squid as bait instead of mackerel would cause a considerable increase in the number of some species of sea turtles being hooked either externally or internally, regardless of the type <b>of</b> <b>hook</b> <b>used.</b> <b>No</b> seabird interaction occurred during the whole experiment.

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 35). Rail inspection is an essential task in railway maintenance. It is periodically needed for preventing dangerous situations and ensuring safety in railways. In Bangladesh it has been seen many train accidents occur due to missing <b>of</b> <b>hooks</b> which attach the tracks to the ground. At present, this task is operated manually by a human operator who periodically walks along the track searching for visual anomalies. This manual inspection is lengthy, laborious and subjective.
