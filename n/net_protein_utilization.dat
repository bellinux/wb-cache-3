40|$|Recently, {{biological}} {{procedures for}} feed protein evaluation in pig and poultry diets {{have been based}} on the amino acid composition of feed ingredients considering the animal's losses during processes of digestion or total <b>protein</b> <b>utilization</b> in a different manner. Such a development towards individual amino acids (AAs) was inevitable according to the disadvantage of traditional protein quality measures, like biological value (BV) or <b>net</b> <b>protein</b> utilization (NPU), to be non-additive in complex animal diets. In consequence, such measures are generally not suitable for predicting the final protein quality of protein mixtures from the individual protein value of feed ingredients. Otherwise, recent measures of AA disappearance from the small intestine up {{to the end of the}} ileum (ileal AA digestibility) also do not provide a true reflection of the biological availability of individual feed AAs independent of the extent of taking into account endogenous AA losses during digestion processes. Sophisticated procedures for protein evaluation are needed considering the AA losses, both during absorption and utilization after absorption. Advantages and limitations of important developments in procedures are discussed. Accordingly, the development of an exponential modelling approach is described (the Göttingen approach), which overcomes some of the traditional disadvantages by measuring the individual AA efficiency. Connecting feed protein evaluation, the modelling of quantitative AA requirements, and improved ideal protein concepts offers different fields of application. In addition, as demonstrated by example, the modelling of nitrogen losses per unit protein deposition and the minimizing of this parameter yields a further interesting tool for lowering the nitrogen burden from <b>protein</b> <b>utilization</b> processes.

The time of nutrient availability within a day is usually considered not to affect the fate of nutrients. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate effects {{of the time of}} nutrient availability within a day (i. e. nutrient synchrony) on the protein and energy metabolism in preruminant calves. Two types of nutrient synchrony were studied: (1) synchrony between total nutrient supply and requirements within a day, and (2) synchrony between protein and carbohydrate availability. The studies were mainly conducted in heavy preruminant calves, because those animals have a very low efficiency of <b>protein</b> <b>utilization</b> for growth compared with other farm animals, such as pigs and lambs, allowing a large potential for improvement. Increasing the feeding frequency increased the efficiency of <b>protein</b> <b>utilization</b> in preruminant calves. This was however not detected when short-term measurements of amino acid metabolism (12 h urea production and oral leucine oxidation) were considered. Dietary carbohydrates were almost completely oxidized, unaffected by feeding level, in heavy preruminant calves. Glucose homeostasis improved with increasing feeding frequency. In pigs, an asynchronous availability of glucose and amino acids within a day reduced <b>protein</b> <b>utilization</b> but did not affect fat retention. In preruminant calves, however, an asynchronous availability of glucose and amino acids did not decrease the efficiency of <b>protein</b> <b>utilization</b> but substantially increased fat retention.

Feed intake, protein absorption, protein retention and protein catabolism were estimated in sole from 8 to 35 days after hatching (DAH), using 14 C-labelled Artemia protein and posterior incubation in metabolic chambers. Postlarvae that were co-fed with an inert diet from mouth opening ate more than postlarvae fed Artemia alone at most sampling ages. Sole Artemia protein digestibility ranged from 56. 97 (16 DAH) to 81. 32 % (22 DAH). Sole larvae that were fed a second meal had a slightly, though significant, higher digestibility than sole fed a single meal. Digestibility was lower in co-fed sole during metamorphosis climax, and similar between treatments at other developmental stages. Retention efficiency remained almost constant during early development, and was not affected by feeding regime. In short, co-feeding of an inert diet from mouth opening does not impair <b>protein</b> <b>utilization</b> by Senegalese sole larvae...|$|R
40|$|Using an auxotrophic {{strain of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we {{examined}} the kinetics of ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis following inhibition of protein synthesis caused by amino acid starvation or cycloheximide. Removal of a required amino acid immediately stopped <b>net</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis. After a brief lag, RNA synthesis also ceased. Cycloheximide, a ribosome-inhibiting drug, also immediately halted <b>net</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis. Again RNA synthesis stopped after a brief lag. Although cycloheximide and amino acid starvation affect different steps in protein biosynthesis, both inhibited RNA synthesis in identical fashion. This indicates that amino acids do not play a unique role in the control of RNA production in rapidly growing yeast; rather, it suggests that RNA synthesis is responsive to the overall rate of protein synthesis itself...|$|R
