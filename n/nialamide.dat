40|$|<b>Nialamide</b> potentiated the pressor {{effects of}} {{noradrenaline}} in the pithed cat. In cats treated with reserpine and then pithed, it prevented {{the restoration of}} the pressor effects of tyramine by slow intravenous infusions of noradrenaline. <b>Nialamide</b> produced a gradual decline in the pressor effects of repeated injections of tyramine whilst the effects of tyramine on the nictitating membrane were potentiated. The development of tachyphylaxis to tyramine in the isolated guinea-pig heart was associated with a 40 % reduction in the myocardial concentration of noradrenaline. The onset of tachyphylaxis to tyramine was more rapid when <b>nialamide</b> was either included in the perfusion fluid or administered in vivo. Prior treatment with <b>nialamide</b> increased threefold the myocardial concentration of noradrenaline; however, the development of tachyphylaxis to tyramine was associated with a proportionate fall in the myocardial concentration of noradrenaline. In five out of nine experiments the acute administration of <b>nialamide</b> increased the output of noradrenaline per stimulus from the isolated cross-perfused spleen of the cat when the stimulus frequency was 30 shocks/sec, but not when the frequency was 10 shocks/sec. When <b>nialamide</b> (20 mg/kg) was given subcutaneously to cats 20 hr before their spleens were isolated and perfused, there was a rapid fall-off in the contractions of the spleen in response to periods of nerve stimulation. The outputs of noradrenaline per stimulus were decreased at both frequencies of stimulation. <b>Nialamide</b> decreased the concentrations of noradrenaline in the myocardium and spleen of the cat. The hypothesis is proposed that <b>nialamide</b> diminishes the availability of transmitter, as a consequence of a decreased re-entry of noradrenaline into a storage site present in nerve endings, and that such a decrease in the availability of noradrenaline in hyperactive nerve pathways may account for the antihypertensive effects of monoamine oxidase inhibitors in man...|$|E

Ther. 174 : 99 - 110, 1970. The effects of debrisoquin (0. 1 - 100 mg/kg), bretylium (0. 1 - 50 mg/kg) and <b>nialamide</b> (5 - 100 mg/kg) on the uptake, storage, metabolism and release of norepinephrine (NE) in adrenergic neurons were studied by the fluorescence histochemical method of Falck and Hillarp in the iris of the albino rat. These agents, given 1 to 16 hours before NE (0. 1 mg/kg i. v.) to reserpine-treated (10 mg/kg i. p.) rats, permitted {{the accumulation of}} this catecholamine in the adrenergic nerves. Pretreatment with these drugs prevented reserpine (25 mg/kg i. p.) -induced NE depletion. These effects of debrisoquin and bretylium were more transient than those of <b>nialamide</b> and, contrary to the latter, were reduced by pre-treatment with desmethylimipramine or protryptaline. However, the former agents were 10 times more potent than <b>nialamide.</b> Large doses of debrisoquin or bretylium blocked nerve transmission and the NE-depleting effects of reserpine and H 44 / 68, an inhibitor of NE biosynthesis in combination with nerve stimulation; smaller doses reduced the depleting ef-fects without altering nerve transmission. Debrisoquin, bretyliurn and desmethylimipramine, but not <b>nialamide,</b> reduced the uptake of a-methyl-NE, a poor monoamine oxidase sub-strate, by the iris of reserpine-treated rats. Finally, debrisoquin (50 mg/kg i. p.) was shown to increase the content of W-NE by the hearts of reserpine-treated (10 mg/kg i. p.) rats. The data suggest that debrisoquin and bretylium are reversible intraneuronal monoamine oxidase inhibitors whose potency in adrenergic neurons occurs because of accumulation by membrane transport. The monoamine oxidase-inhibiting and neuron-blocking activities were separable. Debrisoquin (Moe et al., 1964), guanethidin...|$|E

30|$|Isonicotinic acid (INA) is an {{important}} pyridine derivative used in the synthesis of antituberculostatic drug isoniazid (isonicotinic acid hydrazide).

The pressor responses to tyramine and to phenethylamine declined slowly with repeated injection; the extent of tachyphylaxis induced by these amines depended on the dosage and on the frequency of injection. The pressor responses to α-methyltyramine and to dexamphetamine (α-methylphenethylamine) declined rapidly with successive injections. The tachyphylaxis induced by one indirectly acting sympathomimetic amine is crossed to others, but not to directly acting amines, such as noradrenaline. In animals treated with <b>nialamide,</b> a drug which inhibits monoamine oxidase, the tachyphylaxis induced by tyramine and by phenethylamine was similar to that produced by their α-methyl derivatives in normal animals. Similar results were obtained when the responses to indirectly acting sympathomimetic amines were studied on the cat spleen in situ and on the rabbit heart in vitro.

In both these preparations, after blockade of the effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation had been produced with xylocholine, bretylium or guanethicdine, the sympathomimetic amines, dexamphetamine, mephentermine, hydroxyamphetamine, ephedrine and phenethylamine, reversed the blockade; if these amines were given first, then the adrenergic neurone blocking agents were ineffective. Tyramine and dopamine were effective on the isolated rabbit ileum but not on the cat's nictitating membrane. Effective antagonism of the adrenergic neurone blocking drugs was also shown by some substances which inhibit mono-amine oxidase but only those which in addition possess sympathomimetic effects. Thus phenelzine, pheniprazine and tranylcypromine were effective whereas iproniazid and <b>nialamide</b> were not. Since xylocholine, bretylium and guanethidine were all antagonized by the same agents, it seems likely that they all produce sympathetic blockade by a similar mechanism.

A high dose (5 mg/kg) of reserpine to the recipients reduced localization in the lymph nodes and prevented the usual accumulation of lymphocytes in lymph nodes draining {{the site of an}} antigen (sheep erythrocytes: SE) injection. These effects were partially reversible by the monoamine oxidase inhibitor <b>nialamide.</b> This dose of reserpine produced deep sedation throughout the period of the experiment.

The effect of lower doses of reserpine was not reported. We suggest that the effects on cell localization in both sets of experiments may have been secondary to the general state of sedation and not attributable to a direct local influence of 5 HT.

Deiter's nucleus (DN) or the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) was stimulated in alternation with, and in combination with, stimulation of group I afferents from extensor muscles or of contralateral flexor reflex afferents (coFRA). The evoked polysynaptic EPSPs were recorded in extensor motoneurones when long-latency, long-lasting discharges were evoked by the stimulation of coFRA and when the group I autogenetic inhibition in extensors was reversed to polysynaptic excitation. Spatial facilitation was inferred when the amplitude of the EPSPs evoked by the combined stimuli was notably larger than the algebraic sum of the EPSPs evoked by individual stimulation. Both DN (16 motoneurones) and MLF inputs (8 motoneurones) showed spatial facilitation when preceded by coFRA stimuli and both could reset the rhythm of fictive stepping by triggering a precocious extensor phase. MLF showed spatial facilitation with extensor group I inputs in 69 % of trials but DN failed to show spatial facilitation in any cells. These results indicate that DN and MLF project to the coFRA pathways of the extensor half-centre for locomotion and MLF, but not DN, converge on segmental interneurones of the extensor group I pathways.

40|$|There are {{differences}} between the excitotoxic actions of quinolinic acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) which suggest that quinolinic acid may act by mechanisms additional to the activation of NMDA receptors. The present {{study was designed to}} examine the effect of a potent antioxidant, melatonin, and the potential neuroprotectant, deprenyl, as inhibitors of quinolinic acid-induced brain damage. Injections were made into the hippocampus of anaesthetized rats, which were allowed to recover before the brains were taken for histology and the counting of surviving neurones. Quinolinic acid (120 [*]nmols) induced damage to the pyramidal cell layer, which was prevented by the co-administration of melatonin (5 [*]nmols locally plus 2 × 20 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. p.). This protective effect was not prevented by the melatonin receptor blocker luzindole. Neuronal damage produced by NMDA (120 [*]nmols) was not prevented by melatonin. Quinolinic acid increased the formation of lipid peroxidation products from hippocampal tissue and this effect was prevented by melatonin. Deprenyl also prevented quinolinic acid-induced damage at a dose of 50 [*]nmols but not 10 [*]nmols plus 2 × 1. 0 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. p. The non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitor <b>nialamide</b> (10 and 50 [*]nmols plus 2 × 25 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) did not afford protection. The results suggest that quinolinic acid-induced neuronal damage can be prevented by a receptor-independent action of melatonin and deprenyl, agents which can act as a potent free radical scavenger and can increase the activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes respectively.

Single and repeated treatment with the 5 -HT agonist 5 -MeODMT, and with low doses of the potent releaser of 5 -HT, p-chloroamphetamine (PCA) were {{also included in the}} study. Repeated but not single treatment with 5 -MeODMT reduced strongly but reversibly the ejaculatory response and the behavioural responses. Repeated but not single treatment with the nonselective and irreversible MAO inhibitors <b>nialamide</b> and pargyline reduced markedly the ejaculatory response but only slightly the 5 -HT behavioural responses. Repeated treatment with the irreversible MAO-B inhibitor (-) -deprenyl, with the irreversible MAO-A inhibitor, clorgyline, with the reversible MAO-A inhibitor moclobemide, and with low doses of PCA did not affect either of the responses. Repeated but not single combined treatment with clorgyline plus PCA caused an almost complete blockade of all the four responses. The selective and reversible MAO-A inhibitors (as well as 5 -HT releasers) amiflamine, alpha-ethyltryptamine, and alpha-methyltryptamine reduced markedly the ejaculatory response after both single and repeated treatments. The behavioural responses were blocked only after repeated treatment. It is concluded that single and repeated treatments of rats with different MAO inhibitors do not produce a common alteration in 5 -HT 2 receptor functions.

Dopamine and tetralin-induced dyskinesias in the guinea-pig were reduced or abolished by DHLA given i. p., 30 - 100 mg kg- 1, given once daily for 5 - 10 days. Tetralin-induced dyskinesias were antagonized by DHLA given orally to the guinea-pig (50 - 200 mg kg- 1, 5 days) or in the diet to the rat (approximately 200 mg kg- 1 daily for 10 - 14 days). DHLA injected into the striatum (2. 5 - 20 micrograms bilateral, 2 - 4 days) also antagonized tetralin-induced dyskinesias in the rat. The antidyskinetic action of DHLA given i. p. to the guinea-pig could be antagonized by aspirin or eicosa- 5, 8, 11, 14 -tetraynoic acid (100 mg kg- 1 i. p. daily, starting 2 days before a 5 day treatment with DHLA). Aspirin (25 - 100 mg kg- 1, i. p.) dose-dependently antagonized the antidyskinetic activity of 5 and 20 micrograms DHLA given bilaterally into the striatum (2 days). DHLA (100 mg kg- 1 i. p.) given daily for 10 days or approximately 200 mg kg- 1 DHLA (daily for 10 - 14 days given in the diet) administration to the rat failed to modify the stereotyped behaviour induced by apomorphine, 0. 5 or 2 mg kg- 1 s. c., to induce catalepsy, or to modify the cataleptic effects of haloperidol 0. 25 or 1 mg kg- 1 i. p.

40|$|In high spinal paralysed cats electromyograms were {{recorded}} from nerves supplying lumbar back muscles (longissimus dorsi) and abdominal muscles (obliquus abdominis externus) during fictive locomotion induced by I. V. injection of <b>nialamide</b> and L-DOPA. Activity in nerves to hind-limb muscles was also recorded. During periods of stable 'locomotor' {{activity in the}} hind-limb nerves the efferents to the back and abdominal trunk muscles were generally also rhythmically active. Three different patterns of activity were observed. The predominant rhythmic pattern showed a synchronous activation of the efferents to the back and abdominal muscles of one side together with an activation of the hind-limb flexors of that side, alternating with activation of the efferents to the corresponding contralateral muscles. This pattern was very stable and could last for about 3 h. Such a pattern of activity would be expected during the alternate stepping characteristic of walking and trotting. The second type of rhythmic locomotor activity was characterized by a synchronous bilateral activation of the efferents to the back muscles, alternating with activation of the abdominal muscles on both sides. This pattern occurred only for short periods and appears to correspond to the activity during in-phase stepping such as occurs during a gallop. Beside these well co-ordinated patterns less well co-ordinated rhythmic activities were also observed. These included regular rhythmic activity which occurred independently in different muscle {{groups as well as}} irregular rhythmic activity with unstable phase relations between different muscle groups. The rhythmic locomotor activity in efferents to trunk and limb muscles could be modulated by afferent nerve stimulation and by hypoxia. The results reveal that the spinal cord deprived of its supraspinal and peripheral control may generate a variety of different locomotor patterns, which incorporate the trunk muscles in an apparently meaningful way...|$|E
40|$|The basic {{locomotor}} rhythm in the cat {{is generated}} by a neuronal network in the spinal cord. The exact organization of this network and its drive to the spinal motoneurones is unknown. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to use time (cumulant density) and frequency domain (coherence) analysis to examine the organization of the last order drive to motoneurones during fictive locomotion (evoked by application of <b>nialamide</b> and dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)) in the spinal cat. In all cats, narrow central synchronization peaks (half-width < 3 ms) were observed in cumulants estimated between electroneurograms (ENGs) of close synergists, but not between nerves belonging to muscles acting on different joints or to antagonistic muscles. Coherence was not observed at frequencies above 100 Hz and was mainly observed between synergists. Intracellular recording was obtained from a population of 70 lumbar motoneurones. Significant short-term synchronization was observed between the individual intracellular recordings and the ENGs recorded from nerves of the same pool and of close synergists. Recordings from 34 pairs of motoneurones (10 pairs belonged to the same motor pool, 11 pairs to close synergists and 13 pairs to antagonistic pools) failed to reveal any short-lasting synchronization. These data demonstrate that short-term synchronization during fictive locomotion is relatively weak and is restricted to close synergists. In addition, coherence analysis failed to identify any specific rhythmic component in the locomotor drive that could be associated with this synchronization. These results resemble findings obtained during human treadmill walking and imply that the spinal interneurones participating in the generation of the locomotor rhythm are themselves weakly synchronized. The restricted synchronization within the locomotor drive to motoneuronal pools may be a feature of the locomotor generating networks that is related to the ability of these networks to produce highly adaptive patterns of muscle activity during locomotion. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of neurons and fibres containing monoamines (MA, that is noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin) was {{studied in the}} brain of the weakly electric fish, Eigenmannia lineata, by formaldehyde-induced fluorescence histochemistry. Control experiments using a catecholamine-precursor (Dopa), a MA-depleting (reserpine), and a MA-accumulating (<b>nialamide)</b> drug, together with microspectrofluorometric measurements, allowed to distinguish specific (MA) from unspecific (for example lipofuscine) fluorescence. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) assays of MA of untreated brains yielded 313 ± S. E. 24 ng/g brain tissue noradrenaline, 96 ± S. E. 19 ng/g dopamine, and 71 ± S. E. 12 ng/g serotonin (N = 12 in each case). The highest density of MA-perikarya was found, as in other species, in the diencephalon: {{in the region of}} the nucleus praeopticus periventricularis (npp), in the nucleus ventromedialis (nvm), in the nucleus posterior periventricularis (nppv), and in the hypothalamic nucleus recessus lateralis (nrl) and nucleus recessus posterior (nrp). The mesencephalic torus semicircularis, the "super-laminated" key structure of sensory-motor integration in gymnotids, contained monoamines in the large T-cells of layer VI. Both types of cells of the medullary pacemaker nucleus (pm) of the electric organ, the smaller pacemaker and the larger relay cells, showed specific, yellow fluorescence indicating the presence of monoamines. Fluorescent MA-fibres in the frontal, medial and lateral parts of the telencephalon connected with hypothalamic and midbrain areas. Several electroreceptive layers of the torus semicircularis (layers V, VIII, IX, XI, XIII) showed a clearly recognisable and in some parts dense network of MA-fibres. Only few fluorescent fibres occurred in the massive corpus cerebelli (which is mixed electro-/mechanoreceptive), in the second order electroreceptive lobus lineae lateralis posterior and in the medulla oblongata (ventrolateral to the raphe region, especially in the frontal medulla {{at the level of the}} torus) ...|$|E
40|$|The dawn of {{chemical}} neuroanatomy in the CNS {{came with the}} discovery and mapping of the central dopamine, noradrenaline and 5 -hydroxytryptamine neurons by means of transmitter histochemistry using the Falck-Hillarp formaldehyde fluorescence technique in the early 1960 s. Our mapping of the central monoamine neurons was continued and further established with tyrosine hydroxylase, dopa decarboxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunohistochemistry in collaboration with Menek Goldstein and Tomas Hokfelt. During recent years an evolutionary constraint in the nuclear parcellation of the DA, NA and 5 -HT neurons was demonstrated in the order Rodentia and other mammals. The abundant existence of global monoamine varicose nerve terminal networks synthesizing, storing and releasing monoamines {{in various parts of}} the CNS, including the release of DA by tubero-infundibular DA neurons as a prolactin inhibitory factor from the external layer of the median eminence into the portal vessels and the appearance of extraneuronal DA fluorescence after, e. g., treatment with amphetamine in <b>nialamide</b> pretreated rats (Falck-Hillarp technique) were also remarkable observations. These observations and others like the discovery of transmitter-receptor mismatches opened up the possibility that monoamines were modulating the wired brain, built up mainly by glutamate and GABA neurons, through diffusion and flow in the extracellular fluid of the extracellular space and in the CSF. This transmission also involved long-distance channels along myelinated fibers and blood vessels and was called volume transmission (VT). The extracellular space (ECS), filled with a 3 D matrix, plays a fundamental role in this communication. Energy gradients for signal migration in the ECS are produced via concentration, temperature and pressure gradients, the latter two allowing a flow of the ECF and CSF carrying the VT signals. The differential properties of the wiring transmission (WT) and VT circuits and communication channels will be discussed as well as the role of neurosteroids and oxytocin receptors in volume transmission leading to a new understanding of the integrative actions of neuronal-glial networks. The role of tunneling nanotubes with mitochondrial transfer in CNS inter alia as part of neuron-glia interactions will also be introduced representing a novel type of wiring transmission. The impact of the technicolour approach to the connectome for the future characterization of the wired networks of the brain is emphasized...|$|E
40|$|Uncorrected OCR) Abstract Abstract of thesis {{entitled}} "A {{comparative study}} of some possible mechanisms governing the intraluminal and intravascular release of 5 -HT from the rabbit jejunum" submitted by WONG Joseph Chi-yan for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Pharmacology) at the University of Hong Kong in April 1973. Experiments were carried out on rabbit jejunal segments in. vivo and in vitro under conditions of intraluminal and intravascular perfusion. 5 -HT was released into the effluent of both intraluminal- and intravascular perfusate during perfusion with Krebs solution under quiescent conditions. Enhanced 5 -HT release was observed during active peristalsis elicited by increasing the intraluminalpressure during intraluminal perfusion. The addition of hydrochloric acid in physiological amounts to give pH values of 7. 2, 6, 5 and 4 in Krebs solution revealed a progressive increase in 5 -HT release as the pH fell, during intraluminal perfusion. Enhanced 5 -HT release was also observed during intraluminal perfusions with 0. 3 M and 0. 6 M sucrose solutions; 0. 6 M glucose solution and 7. 5 % egg albumin in Krebs solution. During intraluminal perfusion, Sennosides A & BlO ~g/ml., Nicotine 1 ~g/ml. and Morphine 10 ~g/ml. in Krebs solution, all enhanced 5 -HT release; but not 1 % Monosodium L-glutamate. Monoamine oxidase inhibitor, <b>Nialamide,</b> in a concentration of 100 ~g/ml. prevented. the destruction of both endogenous and exogenous 5 -HT. Nicotine 1 ~g/ml. and Morphine 10 ~g/ml. did not enhance 5 -HT release during intravascular perfusion. From the above observations, it is concluded that, in rabbits, 5 -HT {{is involved in the}} normal physiological functions of digestion, absorption and motility. It possibly functions as a local hormone in regulating these processes. The intravascular release of 5 -HT demonstrated in these experiments may not have any direct physiologic~l significance. It is not appropriate to compare the two perfusion methods in terms of the net amount of released 5 -HT. From histological observations, it is suspected that the results of intraluminal perfusion are complicated by the shedding off of intestinal epithelial cells, into the perfusing fluid. Further investigations are needed to evaluate the reliability of this method {{in the study of the}} phenomenon of 115 -HT release II under such experimental conditions, and the interpretation which can be put upon the results obtained. iiabstracttocPharmacologyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
