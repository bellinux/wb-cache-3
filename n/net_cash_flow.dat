25|$|Careful {{matching}} of {{the discount}} rate to the appropriate measure of economic income {{is critical to the}} accuracy of the business valuation results. <b>Net</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> is a frequent choice in professionally conducted business appraisals. The rationale behind this choice is that this earnings basis corresponds to the equity discount rate derived from the Build-Up or CAPM models: the returns obtained from investments in publicly traded companies can easily be represented in terms of net cash flows. At the same time, {{the discount rate}}s are generally also derived from the public capital markets data.|$|E
2500|$|The Build-Up Method is {{a widely}} {{recognized}} method of determining the after-tax <b>net</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> discount rate, which in turn yields the capitalization rate. The figures used in the Build-Up Method are derived from various sources. This method is called a [...] "build-up" [...] method {{because it is the}} sum of risks associated with various classes of assets. It is based on the principle that investors would require a greater return on classes of assets that are more risky. The first element of a Build-Up capitalization rate is the risk-free rate, which is the rate of return for long-term government bonds. Investors who buy large-cap equity stocks, which are inherently more risky than long-term government bonds, require a greater return, so the next element of the Build-Up method is the equity risk premium. In determining a company's value, the long-horizon equity risk premium is used because the Company's life is assumed to be infinite. The sum of the risk-free rate and the equity risk premium yields the long-term average market rate of return on large public company stocks.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn an {{uncertain}} economic environment, experts’ knowledge about outlays and cash inflows of available projects consists of much vagueness instead of randomness.

Nevertheless, the lack of accuracy in estimation of future <b>net</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> does not always follow a random variable but a fuzzy one. In this article Fuzzy set theory has thus been used as a tool in determining the net present value of an investment project. The <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and the rates of discount are viewed as fuzzy numbers. Two models are developed to study the isolated effects of each one of these variables on net present value calculations. A third model develops the joint effect of <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and the rates of discount. It is concluded that this approach is simpler in its process and assumes fewer hypotheses about the behaviour of the related variables than traditional models. Fuzzy sets capital budgeting...|$|R

First, {{a conceptual framework}} regarding Net Present Value, NPV, is presented.

Fourth, the EVA is presented and contrasted to NPV. EVA starts from accounting figures (profit) and NPV starts from <b>net</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> The coincidence between MVA and NPV is examined. Four examples are presented which reveal some inconsistencies between the two measurement. The four examples show circumstances where EVA underestimates the value generated by a project or firm {{as compared with the}} NPV. An approach for calculating the real EVA is presented. The note offers reflections upon figures that should be employed in order to calculate the cost of the invested capital or equity to be included in EVA calculation. Finally, different approaches to calculate EVA and MVA are compared with NPV results. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{whether the}} combinations of <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> components segregated by activities help predict impending financial distress {{relative to other}} financial information. Firms experience financial distress if they cannot generate adequate cash to meet their needs. When financially distressed firms fall short of cash from operations, they obtain cash from investing and financing activities to mend their financial problems. Information about the relationships among operating, investing, and financing <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> is expected to provide users with another approach for evaluating whether firms are performing well or facing financial distress. In this study, eight combinations of operating, investing, and financing <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> are used as predictors in the financial distress prediction models. ^ The findings {{support the hypothesis that}} the combinations of <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> from operating, investing, and financing activities reported in the statement of <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> during a fiscal period are predictive of financial distress incremental to other financial information. Relative to healthy firms, distressed firms {{are more likely to have}} the following <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> combinations: (1) the combination of negative <b>net</b> operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow,</b> positive <b>net</b> investing <b>cash</b> <b>flow,</b> and negative <b>net</b> financing <b>cash</b> flow; and (2) the combination of negative net operating, investing, and financing <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> In contrast, compared to healthy firms, distressed firms are less likely to have the following <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> combinations: (1) the combination of positive <b>net</b> operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow,</b> negative <b>net</b> investing <b>cash</b> <b>flow,</b> and positive <b>net</b> financing <b>cash</b> flow; and (2) the combination of positive <b>net</b> operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and negative <b>net</b> investing and financing <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> Empirical evidence suggests that firms face financial distress when they generate insufficient cash from operations to meet ongoing cash needs. Financially distressed firms acquire additional cash from investing activities or use their cash reserve to solve financial problems. However, their financial problems become more severe if they run out of assets that can be sold or if their cash reserve is exhausted. ...|$|R
