50|$|In Canada, the {{distribution}} of the <b>Nooksack</b> <b>dace</b> is limited to four streams: three in the Nooksack basin, and one in the Fraser basin. In Canada, degradation of the stream channels due to urbanization, agriculture and low instream flow has led to the species being declared endangered under Canada's Species at Risk Act. The <b>Nooksack</b> <b>dace</b> requires shallow, fast flowing riffle habitat within stream channels, and a low flow during the summer has been identified as a key threat to the recovery of this endangered species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Nooksack</b> <b>dace</b> is {{much more}} widely {{distributed}} in Washington, occurring in eastern Puget Sound drainages from the Nooksack south to the Puyallup, and in Pacific coastal drainages from the Quillayute south to the Willapa.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Nooksack</b> <b>dace</b> {{is a small}} cyprinid fish {{occurring}} in streams in southern British Columbia and western Washington state. It {{has not yet been}} formally described taxonomically. It is considered a genetically distinct subspecies of longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae), but may be a distinct species.|$|E
40|$|I {{demonstrate}} {{the efficiency and}} cost-effectiveness of a two-stage sampling method for estimating abundance of <b>Nooksack</b> <b>dace</b> (Rhinichthys cataractae), an endangered minnow in Canada. This two-stage process involves single-pass sampling, followed by calibration of single-pass sampling capture efficiency using a mark-recapture method. Based on this two-stage method, my estimated abundances in the Brunette River, Bertrand Creek, Pepin Creek, and Fishtrap Creek were 2, 763 fish (95 % confidence intervals (CI) : 1, 823 - 4, 537), 4, 359 fish (95 % CI: 2, 499 - 7, 991), 30 fish (95 % CI: 12 - 136), and 0 fish, respectively. My presence-absence model demonstrated that mean water depth, mean water velocity, and level of substrate embeddedness are important habitat characteristics affecting presence of <b>Nooksack</b> <b>dace</b> in riffle habitats. To assess the long-term recovery of this species, I recommend conducting monitoring at 5 -year intervals by sampling 15 to 25 sites in each stream using my two-stage method, {{resulting in a total}} annual monitoring cost of about $ 23, 700...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{integral}} components of Canadaâ€™s Species at Risk Act (SARA) is recovery planning for threatened, endangered, or extirpated species in Canada. The recovery planning process {{is guided by}} recovery strategies, to be published within one year of listing for endangered species and within two years of listing for threatened or extirpated species, though publication has rarely met statutory timelines. Here I investigate factors associated with recovery strategy completion as well as factors associated with strategy content, specifically recovery feasibility, information gaps, and critical habitat identification. Despite significant delays in strategy publication, I find no evidence of internal prioritization of species for strategy completion, with only administrative factors retained in predictive models; species listed on Schedule 1, for which the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) or Parks Canada Agency (PCA) is the Responsible Authority, or which there was a smaller backlog of due strategies one year after listing {{were more likely to}} have recovery strategies submitted on time. Analysis of factors associated with recovery feasibility show a higher likelihood of feasible recovery for species for which critical habitat is identified, the DFO or PCA is the Responsible Authority, there are more identified information gaps, or for which the recovery strategy contains a section on potential socioeconomic conflict. There were fewer identified information gaps in recovery strategies for those species for which recovery strategies were published after the judgments of the <b>Nooksack</b> <b>Dace</b> (ND) and Greater Sage-Grouse (SG) court proceedings, there was a greater time elapsed between strategy due date and date of draft publication, or whose range does not fall on a provincial or federal protected area. Pre-ND and SG court judgements, critical habitat was less likely to be identified for species with a lower threat status, species included in multi-species or ecosystem plans, or species not found within provincial or federal protected areas. None of these biases were detected post-judgement, however, as rates of identification increased significantly and only recovery feasibility was associated with CH identification. These results point to some potential problems in the recovery planning process as currently implemented under SARA, and inform recommendations as to how these might be addressed...|$|E
