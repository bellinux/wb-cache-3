5|$|Diplomatic efforts {{between the}} Netherlands and the Republic {{continued}} throughout 1948 and 1949. Political pressures, {{both domestic and}} international, hindered Dutch attempts to decide upon objectives. Similarly, Republican leaders faced great difficulty in persuading their people to accept diplomatic concessions. By July 1948 negotiations were in deadlock and the Netherlands pushed unilaterally towards Van Mook’s federal Indonesia concept. The <b>new</b> <b>federal</b> <b>states</b> of South Sumatra and East Java were created, although neither had a viable support base. The Netherlands set up the Bijeenkomst voor Federaal Overleg (BFO) (or Federal Consultative Assembly), a body comprising {{the leadership of the}} federal states, and charged with the formation of a United States of Indonesia and an interim government by the end of 1948. The Dutch plans, however, had no place for the Republic unless it accepted a minor role already defined for it. Later plans included Java and Sumatra but dropped all mention of the Republic. The main sticking point in the negotiations was the balance of power between the Netherlands High Representative and the Republican forces.|$|E
25|$|Over the {{objections}} of Bundesbank president Karl Otto Pöhl, he allowed a 1:1 exchange rate for wages, interest and rent between the West and East Marks. In the end, this policy would seriously hurt companies in the <b>new</b> <b>federal</b> <b>states.</b> Together with Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Kohl was able to resolve talks with the former Allies of World War II to allow German reunification. He received assurances from Gorbachev that a reunified Germany {{would be able to}} choose which international alliance it wanted to join, although Kohl made no secret that he wanted the reunified Germany to inherit West Germany's seats at NATO and the EC.|$|E
25|$|Due to the Transport Route Planning Acceleration Act (Verkehrswegeplanungsbeschleunigungsgesetz) adopted {{specifically}} for the new transport routes in the <b>new</b> <b>federal</b> <b>states,</b> {{it was possible to}} put the first planning approval decision for the Erfurt–Arnstadt section into effect at the end of 1994. The planning approval decisions for the new routes were adopted between 24May 1995 and 15April 1997. In the middle of 1996, 75kilometres of the new line and 25kilometres of the rail power line were approved. The approvals were finalised in 1998 apart from the Erfurtstadt and Bad Staffelstein sections. In the middle of 2007, the approvals were finalised for all sections. The planning approval decision for the southern section of the railway power line from the 19December 1995 lost its effect because the construction work had not commenced within the limited period of validity. As a result, a plan for the southern section of the railway power line to the Roth substation was reapplied for in 2012.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the run-up}} to the German general {{election}} in 2005, which was held ahead of schedule, Stoiber created controversy through a campaign speech held in the beginning of August 2005 in the federal state of Baden-Württemberg.

[...] People in the <b>new</b> <b>federal</b> <b>states</b> of Germany (the former German Democratic Republic) were offended by Stoiber's remarks. While the CSU attempted to portray them as [...] "misinterpreted", Stoiber created further controversy when he claimed that [...] "if it was like Bavaria everywhere, there wouldn't be any problems. Unfortunately, not everyone in Germany is as intelligent as in Bavaria." [...] The tone of the comments was exacerbated by a perception by some within Germany of the state of Bavaria as [...] "arrogant".|$|E
