2500|$|It was the Hatfield {{crash on}} 17 October 2000 {{that proved to}} be the {{defining}} moment in Railtrack's collapse. [...] The subsequent major repairs undertaken across the whole British rail network are estimated to have cost in the order of £580 million. According to Christian Wolmar, author of On the Wrong Line, the Railtrack board panicked in the wake of Hatfield. Because most of the engineering skill of British Rail had been sold off into the maintenance and renewal companies, Railtrack had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> Hatfields were waiting to happen, nor did they have any way of assessing the consequence of the speed restrictions they were ordering – restrictions that brought the railway network to all but a standstill.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 January 2011, the Northern Virginia Technology Council {{released}} {{the report of}} its three-month investigation into record keeping at the cemetery. [...] The report concluded that, [...] "Antiquated paper record-keeping and lack of oversight led to the mishandling of dozens of remains at the nation's most important military burial ground" [...] and recommended that [...] "the cemetery must digitize its records, improve its scheduling system and establish a rigorous chain of custody for remains as they move from funeral homes to burial." [...] Two months later, Arlington officials admitted that the cemetery had for years informally maintained a system of [...] "plot booking"—setting aside choice burial plots for high-ranking military officers and civilian officials—in violation of Army regulations. [...] Although the plot booking system was suspended in 1962, the Washington Post reported in March 2011 that it had unofficially continued under cemetery superintendents Raymond J. Costanzo and John C. Metzler, Jr. until 2010. [...] Cemetery officials said that, due to poor recordkeeping, they had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> plots had been pre-booked, how many pre-bookings were still valid {{because they had been}} made prior to 1962, and how many plots were mistakenly labeled pre-booked (or [...] "obstructed" [...] in the cemetery's jargon). Cemetery officials also admitted they had largely failed to inform individuals with pre-booked plots that they may no longer be eligible for burial at Arlington National Cemetery due to changing burial eligibility rules. [...] Cemetery superintendent Kathryn Condon stated, [...] "We do not do reservations, and anyone who claims to have a reservation post-1962, we do not accommodate them. When the loved one or veteran passes, that's when we determine where we’ll bury them." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{graves of}} unknown {{soldiers}} and the memorials to thosewho have no known resting place are the visible {{reminders of the}} enormous human toll due to conflict in the twentieth century, a toll that continues to this day. Over the past century, our ability {{to kill each other}} has increased far beyond what could have been imagined by those sitting in the trenches in the First World War, as fragile biplanes that posed a greater risk to those flying in them evolved into modern jet fighters firing precision guided missiles. Yet this “progress ” contrasts starkly with our failures in other areas, including our ability to count the human cost of conflict. Despite the use of intense surveillance from satellites, pilotless drones and the like, the coalition forces in Iraq seem to have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> about <b>how</b> <b>many</b> Iraqi civilians have been killed since the country was invaded. It has been left to non-governmental organisations and academics to produce the figures, which may be as high as 100, 000 deaths. ...|$|R

40|$|Research on {{spreadsheet}} errors is substantial, compelling, and unanimous. It {{has three}} simple conclusions. The {{first is that}} spreadsheet errors are rare on a per-cell basis, but in large programs, at least one incorrect bottom-line value is very likely to be present. The second is that errors are extremely difficult to detect and correct. The third is that spreadsheet developers and corporations are highly overconfident in the accuracy of their spreadsheets. The disconnect between the first two conclusions and the third appears {{to be due to}} the way human cognition works. Most importantly, we are aware of very few of the errors we make. In addition, while we are proudly aware of errors that we fix, we have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>how</b> <b>many</b> remain, but like Little Jack Horner we are impressed with our ability to ferret out errors. This paper reviews human cognition processes and shows first that humans cannot be error free no matter how hard they try, and second that our intuition about errors and how we can reduce them is based on appallingly bad knowledge. This paper argues that we should reject any prescription for reducing errors that has not been rigorously proven safe and effective. This paper also argues that our biggest need, based on empirical data, is to do massively more testing than we do now. It suggests that the code inspection methodology developed in software development is likely to apply very well to spreadsheet inspection. Comment: 15 Pages, 5 Figures, 3 Tables, some in colou...|$|R

In them, he forms melodies based on an [...] "otonal" [...] eight-note just-intonation scale made from the 8th through 15th partials of the harmonic series) or its [...] "utonal" [...] inversion. He then gains new pitches by using common-tone transpositions or inversions. Many of his works also feature an expansive use of just intonation, using high prime limits. His String Quartet No. 9 uses intervals of the harmonic series {{as high as the}} 31st partial.

Now, there is a young girl sitting at the first window, with her profile outlined by the light, whom I feel it an honor to speak to. That's her brother, standing there with her--that tall, gaunt {{young man with a}} Roman face; it's such a common type here in the mountains. Their father was a soldier, and he distinguished himself so in one of the last battles that he was promoted. He was badly wounded, but he never took a pension; he just came back to his farm and worked on till he died. Now the son has the farm, and he and his sister live there with their mother. The daughter takes in sewing, and in that way they manage to make both ends meet. The girl is really a first-rate seamstress, and so cheap! I give her a good deal of my work in the summer, and we are quite friends. She's very fond of reading; the mother is an invalid, but she reads aloud while the daughter sews, and you've <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> books they get through. When she comes for sewing, I like to talk with her about them; I always have her sit down; it's hard to realize that she isn't a lady. I'm a good deal criticised, I know, and I suppose I do spoil her a little; it puts notions into such people's heads, if you meet them in that way; they're pretty free and independent as it is. But when I'm with Lizzie I forget that there is any difference between us; I can't help loving the child. You must take Mr. Homos to see them, Mr. Twelvemough. They've got the father's sword hung up over the head of the mother's bed; it's very touching. But the poor little place is so bare!" ...|$|E
60|$|The Eagles came; this is {{the second}} time; I am glad to get them--Jeff, wait till you get four or five, and then send them with a two-cent stamp. I have not had any letter from George. Mother, have you heard anything? did the money come? Dear mother, how are you nowadays? I do hope you feel well and in good spirits--I think about you {{every day of my life}} out here. Sometimes I see women in the hospitals, mothers come to see their sons, and {{occasionally}} one that makes me think of my dear mother--one did very much, a lady about 60, from Pennsylvania, come to see her son, a captain, very badly wounded and his wound gangrened, and they after a while removed him to a tent by himself. Another son of hers, a young man, came with her to see his brother. She was a pretty full-sized lady, with spectacles; she dressed in black--looked real Velsory.[17] I got very well acquainted with her; she had a real Long Island old-fashioned way--but I had to avoid the poor captain, as it was that time that my hand was cut in the artery, and I was liable to gangrene myself--but she and the two sons have gone home now, but I doubt whether the wounded one is alive, as he was very low. Mother, I want to hear about Andrew too, whether he went to Rockland lake. You have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> soldiers there are who have lost their voices, and have to speak in whispers--there are a great many, I meet some almost every day; as far as that alone is concerned, Andrew must not be discouraged, as the general health may be good as common irrespective of that. I do hope Andrew will get along better than he thinks for--it is bad enough for a poor man to be out of health even partially, but he must try to look on the bright side. Mother, have you heard anything from Han since, or from Mary's folks? I got a letter from Mrs. Price last week; if you see Emma tell her I was pleased to get it, and shall answer it very soon. Mother, I have sent another letter to the N. Y. Times--it may appear, if not to-day, within a few days. I am feeling excellent well these days, it is so moderate and pleasant weather now; I was getting real exhausted with the heat. I thought of you too, how it must have exhausted you those hot days. I still occupy the same 3rd story room, 394 L st., and get my breakfast in my room in the morning myself, and dinner at a restaurant about 3 o'clock--I get along very well and very economical (which is a forced put, but just as well). But I must get another room or a boarding-house soon, as the folks are all going to move this month. My good and real friends the O'Connors live in the same block; I am in there every day. Dear mother, tell Mat and Miss Mannahatta I send them my love--I want to see them both. O how I want to see Jeff and you, mother; I sometimes feel as if I should just get in the cars and come home--and the baby too, you must always write about her. Dear mother, good-bye for present.|$|E
