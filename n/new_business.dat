50|$|Business {{development}} in Winkler has boomed {{in the years}} since incorporation. On average, the city becomes home to 10-20 <b>new</b> <b>businesses</b> per year. In 2002, 55 <b>new</b> <b>businesses</b> were established in Winkler. The increase in <b>new</b> <b>businesses</b> can be attributed to low taxes, reasonably priced real estate and cooperation between the city and entrepreneurs. One example of this is the recently established Incubator Mall, a city-owned, five office facility that gives <b>new</b> <b>businesses</b> the opportunity to rent office space at moderate rates. Once those businesses outgrow the space, they relocate, making room for new startups.|$|R
