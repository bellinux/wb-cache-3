5|$|The {{gauge of}} the new line was <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>determined,</b> {{although}} the estimates had been prepared {{on the basis that}} it would not exceed 6feet. Many of Grainger and Miller's lines had been to a gauge of 4ft6in; the Dundee and Newtyle Railway (1831) had been at 4ft6½in (1,384mm) and the Dundee and Arbroath Railway, authorised in 1836, was to be 5ft6in (1,676mm). Connections to local railways were considered important in determining the gauge, but the engineer Joseph Locke urged that conformity to the gauge of the English railways was important, and in the end this was adopted: standard gauge, 4ft8½in (1,435mm).|$|E

25|$|Johnson's and Coleman's {{bodies were}} found later, {{on the night of}} July 23, when firefighters were alerted to a burning vehicle. They were found lying on {{the back seat of the}} Jeep. Their bodies were burned beyond recognition, and {{investigators}} were unable to determine the race or sex of either victim. Police treated the deaths as homicides, though they had <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>determined</b> whether the victims had been murdered.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{contrasting}} {{character of the}} east-striking and southeast-striking segments is unsettling, and the change of direction somewhat difficult to reconcile with the observed fault traces. Especially as seismic reflection data shows some faulting continuing east across Vashon Island and the East Passage of Puget Sound (the East Passage Zone, EPZ) towards Federal Way and an east-striking anticline. Whether the faulting continues eastward is <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>determined.</b> The EPZ is active, being the locale of the 1995 M 5 Point Robinson earthquake.|$|E

In 2015 the first air zone reports for BC were published. They show that Crofton, Smithers and Vanderhoof are not meeting the PM2.5 standard. This is a trigger for corrective intervention. The exact type of intervention is <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>determined,</b> partly because it's a new process {{and partly because of}} variable site-specific factors.

25|$|On 28 June the AIBN {{released}} a new preliminary report where they {{stated that the}} most likely cause to the accident was a fatigue fracture {{in one of the}} second stage planet gears. They had <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>determined</b> what initiated the fracture. AIBN draws similarity to the 2009 Bond Helicopters Eurocopter AS332 crash, also caused by a gearbox fracture. Whereas particles had been detected in the Scottish gearbox's oil prior to the crash, no such indication was present for the Norwegian gearbox. , AIBN continued investigations with no indication of when a conclusion could be made. Also in February 2017, EASA issued a notice for operators to investigate the oil cooler for 16NCD13 alloy from the gearbox.|$|E
25|$|In {{the longer}} term, FWS plans to create up to 30 acres (12 ha) of {{additional}} grassland {{by removing the}} runway pavement and restoring the original cover. An 8-foot (2 m) wide strip of concrete would be left {{for use as a}} public trail. While grasses are already beginning to grow through cracks in the runways, the agency would prefer not to wait as aircraft continue to make illegal landings at the refuge, disturbing the birds, despite markings on the runways themselves and on aviation charts of the area indicating that the facility is closed. It has <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>determined</b> how this will be done in the most environmentally sensitive fashion. Similarly, it hopes to restore the original stream pattern through the property by removing the culverts and other reroutings made during construction of the airfield.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, only 5 {{students}} were attending Wyangala Dam Public School. This significant decline in numbers {{was attributed to}} the ageing population of the Wyangala community {{and the lack of}} any new young families within the village and surrounding area. Consequently, the school was at risk of closure if student numbers did not increase. A meeting to discuss the future of schooling within the village was held on 23 June 2015 with the Director of Public Schools Orange Network, allowing village residents and current and former students to ask questions and to present the case for keeping the school open. Any decision by the NSW Department of Education and Training regarding the schools future is to be decided at some future date, <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>determined.</b> In 2015, village residents created a working group to launch a campaign to attract new students to the school, this campaign has continued until the present.|$|E
25|$|MSU {{implemented}} a 5 {{percent rise in}} student tuition for the 2012-2013 school year, which generated an extra $11 million revenue. Coupled with an extra $4 million in legislative spending and other revenues, the university's 2012-2013 school year budget grew by 9.1 percent to $168.6 million. Another $2.1 million remained unspent, as the university had <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>determined</b> final enrollment figures by September 2012. About $1.2 million of these funds were spent on 16 projects, ranging from hiring student mental health counselors, creating a doctoral program in the College of Nursing, a master's degree in science and nature filmmaking, a sustainable food and bioenergy degree, an Undergraduate Scholars Program to encourage undergraduate research, new equipment and {{an expansion of the}} Taylor Planetarium at the Museum of the Rockies, and an architect to design a renovation of Romney Gym. The Budget Council received requests for funding, held campus-wide meetings to gain student input about them, prioritized them, and sent them to Cruzado for approval.|$|E

According to our reports, it was responded to quickly by trained professionals. Paramedics were notified within seconds of the collapse and were by [...] side in minutes. Although medical authorities have <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>determined</b> what caused Mr. Slee's death, it is evident that the est training could not have had anything to do with it." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an article}} for IGN, Pete Hines {{challenged}} the statements, providing an alternate rationale for the content packages' absence. Firstly, he stated, the expansions were removed to avoid giving a PS3 player an early advantage over other consoles' players. Secondly, he stated, the game designers were unfamiliar with the PlayStation Network Store and Sony's online content distribution systems, and had <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>determined</b> the best method of releasing the packages. The suggestion that the PS3's technical makeup determined the move could not be [...] "farther from the truth". Hines confirmed that the shader improvements for the PS3 would eventually migrate to the PC and Xbox 360 through further patches, but noted that some optimizations would remain exclusive to the PS3. In the end, the Xbox 360 and the PS3 would be [...] "very much on a par" [...] in their graphical performance.|$|E
