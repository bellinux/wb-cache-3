50|$|The {{breakup of}} the <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> occurs between mid March to mid May. This event signifies the {{transition}} from winter to spring, and has impacts on the hydrological cycle, growing seasons of vegetation, and overall ecosystem productivity. The timing of the transition also influences changes in sea ice, ozone, air temperature, and cloudiness. Early and late polar breakup episodes have occurred, due to variations in the stratospheric flow structure and upward spreading of planetary waves from the troposphere. As a result of increased waves into the vortex, the vortex experiences more rapid warming than normal, resulting in an earlier breakup and spring. When the breakup comes early, it is characterized by with persistent of remnants of the vortex. When the breakup is late, the remnants dissipate rapidly. When the breakup is early, there is one warming period from late February to middle March. When the breakup is late, there are two warming periods, one January, and one in March. Zonal mean temperature, wind, and geopotential height exert varying deviations from their normal values before and after early breakups, while the deviations remain constant before and after late breakups. Scientists are connecting a delay in the Arctic vortex breakup with a reduction of planetary wave activities, few stratospheric sudden warming events, and depletion of ozone.|$|E
40|$|Measurements made in {{the outer}} ring of the <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> from October 1991 through March 1992 reveal an altitude-dependent change in ozone, with a {{decrease}} {{at the bottom of}} the vortex and a substantial increase at the highest altitudes accessible to measurement. The increase is the result of ozone-rich air entering the vortex, and the decrease reflects ozone loss accumulated after the descent of the air through high concentrations of reactive chlorine. The depleted air that is released out of the bottom of the vortex is sufficient to significantly reduce column ozone at mid-latitudes...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of atmospheric {{dust on the}} dynamics and stability of the martian polar vortices is examined, through analysis of Mars Climate Sounder observations and MarsWRF general circulation model simulations. We show that regional and global dust storms produce transient vortex warming events that partially or fully disrupt the <b>northern</b> winter <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> for brief periods. Increased atmospheric dust heating alters the Hadley circulation and shifts the downwelling branch of the circulation poleward, leading to a disruption of the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> {{for a period of}} days to weeks. Through our simulations, we find this effect is dependent on the atmospheric heating rate, which can be changed by increasing the amount of dust in the atmosphere or by altering the dust optical properties (e. g., single scattering albedo). Despite this, our simulations show that some level of atmospheric dust is necessary to produce a distinct <b>northern</b> hemisphere winter <b>polar</b> <b>vortex...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{strength}} of the <b>northern</b> wintertime stratospheric <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> is observed to be modulated by the phase of the equatorial quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), so that the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> tends to be weaker and more disturbed when the QBO is easterly. However, observations suggest that this relationship is modulated by the 11 -year solar cycle. In this study we explore {{the life cycle of}} the QBO-solar cycle relationship using ECMWF re-analyses. By examining the relationship at various stratospheric levels, we find that during 1958 - 2006 the QBO-modulated solar cycle signals move poleward and downward as winter progresses, and are strongest in late winter.

40|$|The <b>northern</b> winter <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> is more {{disturbed}} dynamically and {{warmer than}} the Antarctic equivalent, and correspondingly fewer polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) are observed to form. However, the rapid flow of stratospheric air through slow moving synoptically forced PSC regions {{can result in}} exposure of both vortical and extra vortical air to PSCs intermittently throughout the winter months. This periodic exposure to PSCs may be sufficient to perturb the chemical composition of large volumes of nothern hemisphere air. The synoptic forcing also leads to marked meridional flow which has {{a profound effect on}} chemical composition, having major impacts on both short term ozone depletion and the longer term recovery to lower ClOx abundances. Accurate simulation of the air flow is thus essential for the reliable calculation of ozone loss in polar regions...|$|R
30|$|The {{present study}} {{analyses}} the short-term fluctuations in stratospheric ozone {{measured by the}} GROMOS radiometer from June 2011 to May 2012. We selected this time interval since it covers a full year with the winter in the centre. Further, the disturbance of the <b>Northern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> was relatively simple in winter 2011 / 2012 which is mainly characterised by a minor sudden stratospheric warming in mid-January 2012 (Chandran et al. 2013). Thus, the attribution between the polar vortex disturbance and the behaviour of the short-term ozone fluctuations above Bern is easier in this year compared to other years.|$|E
40|$|In late January {{and early}} February 1983, {{observations}} {{made by the}} Stratospheric Aerosol Measurement (SAM II) satellite system showed that aerosol extinction profiles measured within the <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> differed significantly above 18 km from those measured outside the vortex. Values of the calculated optical depths above 18 km for February 1, 1983, are lower by approximately one order of magnitude within the polar vortex than those outside. Similar {{differences were found in}} the aerosol back-scattering profiles obtained using an airborne lidar system when crossing the polar vortex.

40|$|International audienceFor {{the winter}} 1999 / 2000 {{transport}} of air masses {{out of the}} vortex to mid-latitudes and ozone destruction {{inside and outside the}} <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> is studied to quantify the impact of earlier winter (before March) polar ozone destruction on mid-latitude ozone. Nearly 112 000 trajectories are started on 1 December 1999 on 6 different potential temperature levels between 500 ? 600 K and for a subset of these trajectories photo-chemical box-model calculations are performed. We linked a decline of ? 0. 9 % of mid-latitude ozone in this layer occurring in January and February 2000 to ozone destruction inside the vortex and successive transport of these air masses to mid-latitudes. Further, the impact of denitrification, PSC-occurrence and anthropogenic chlorine loading on future stratospheric ozone is determined by applying various scenarios. Lower stratospheric temperatures and denitrification were found to play the most important role in the future evolution of polar ozone depletion...|$|E
40|$|The {{observed}} {{strengthening of}} the <b>Northern</b> Hemisphere (NH) <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> after tropical volcanic eruptions appears to be underestimated by coupled climate models. However, {{there are only a}} limited number of observed eruptions, which makes the attribution of volcanic signals difficult, because the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> is also influenced by other external forcing factors as well as internal variability. We show with a 100 -member ensemble of historical (1850 – 2005) simulations with the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model that an ensemble larger than what is provided by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 5) models is needed to detect a statistically significant NH <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> strengthening. The most robust signal can be found when only the two strongest eruptions (Krakatau and Pinatubo) are considered in contrast to including smaller eruptions to increase the sample size. For these two strongest eruptions, the mean of 15 CMIP 5 models shows a statistically significant {{strengthening of the}} NH <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> as well...|$|R
40|$|There {{is ample}} {{evidence}} {{that the state of}} the <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> stratospheric <b>vortex</b> in boreal winter influences tropospheric variability. Therefore, the main teleconnection patterns over the North Atlantic are defined separately for winter episodes in which the zonal mean wind at 50 hPa and 65 &deg; N is above or below the critical Rossby velocity for zonal planetary wave one. It turns out that the teleconnection structure in the middle and upper troposphere differs considerably between the two regimes of the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex,</b> while {{this is not the case}} at sea level. If the &quot;polar vortex is strong&quot;, there exists &quot;one&quot; meridional dipole structure of geopotential height in the upper and middle troposphere, which is situated in the central North Atlantic. If the &quot;polar vortex is weak&quot;, there exist &quot;two&quot; such dipoles, one over the western and one over the eastern North Atlantic. Storm tracks (and precipitation related with these) are determined by mid and upper tropospheric conditions and we find significant differences of these parameters between the stratospheric regimes. For the strong <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> regime, in case of a negative upper tropospheric &quot;NAO&quot; index we find a blocking height situation over the Northeast Atlantic and the strongest storm track of all. It is reaching far north into the Arctic Ocean and has a secondary maximum over the Denmark Strait. Such storm track is not found in composites based on a classic NAO defined by surface pressure differences between the Icelandic Low and the Azores High. Our results show that it is essential to include the state of the upper dynamic boundary conditions (the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> strength) in any study of the variability over the North Atlantic. Climate forecast based solely on the forecast of a &quot;classic NAO&quot; and further statistical downscaling may lead to the wrong conclusions if the state of the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> is not considered as well...|$|R
40|$|Intensive {{ozonesonde}} {{observations were}} conducted at Wakkanai(45. 4 °N, 141. 7 °E), the northernmost city of Japan, {{during the period}} 15 th to 24 th February 2001. Air in the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> passed over Wakkanai on 19 th February 2001 on the 700 K isentropic surface. An increase of potential vorticity and a decrease of ozone mixing ratio on the 700 K isentropic surface over Wakkanai were observed on the same day, 19 th February 2001. On the other hand, on the 450 K isentropic surface {{the air in the}} <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> passed over Tsukuba(36. 1 °N, 140. 1 °E), Japan, where the Aerological Observatory and the Meteorological Research Institute are located, on 20 th February 2001. Decrease of the ratio of observed HCl(hydrogen chloride) to HCl estimated from HF(hydrogen fluoride) and increases of the potential vorticity and ozone mixing ratio on the 450 K isentropic surface were observed over Tsukuba on 20 th February 2001. These facts indicate that the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> passed over Tsukuba on the 450 K isentropic surface on 20 th February 2001. Observations show that the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> on the 700 K isentropic surface existed over Europe and Siberia on 14 th February 2001 moved eastward, and reached Wakkanai, Japan on 19 th February 2001.

40|$|The {{temperature}} of the Arctic lower stratosphere is critical for understanding polar ozone levels. As temperatures drop below about 195 K, polar stratospheric clouds form, which then convert HCl and ClONO 2 into reactive forms that are catalysts for ozone loss reactions. Hence, the lower stratospheric temperature during the March period is a key parameter for understanding polar ozone losses. The temperature is basically understood to {{be a result of}} planetary waves which drive the polar temperature away from a cold "radiative equilibrium" state. This is demonstrated using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis calculations of the heat flux and the mean polar temperature. The temperature during the March period is fundamentally driven by the integrated impact of large scale waves moving from the troposphere to the stratosphere during the January through February period. We will further show that the recent cold years in the <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> are a result of this weakened wave driving of the stratosphere...|$|E
40|$|A key {{aspect of}} this project is the {{establishment}} of a causal link from circulation anomalies in the lower mesosphere and stratopause region downward through the stratosphere to the troposphere. The observational link for stratospheric sudden warmings and surface climate is fairly clear. However, our understanding of the dynamics is incomplete. We have been making significant progress in the area of dynamical mechanisms by which circulation anomalies in the stratosphere affect the troposphere. We are trying to understand the details and sequence of events that occur when a middle atmosphere (wind) anomaly propagates downward to near the tropopause. The wind anomaly could be caused by a warming or solar variations in the low-latitude stratopause region, or could have other causes. The observations show a picture that is consistent with a circulation anomaly that descends to the tropopause region, and can be detected as low as the mid-troposphere. Processes near the stratopause in the tropics appear to be important precursors to the wintertime development of the <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex.</b> This may affect significantly our understanding of the process by which low-latitude wind anomalies in the low mesosphere and upper stratosphere evolve through the winter and affect the polar vortex...|$|E
30|$|Many {{studies are}} devoted {{to the role of}} PW-mean flow {{interactions}} in penetration of equatorial QBOs to the middle and high latitudes (e.g., Dunkerton and Baldwin 1991; O’Sullivan and Young 1992; Garfinkel et al. 2012; Lu et al. 2014). Some studies show that zonal wind velocity in the <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> can differ during the westerly QBO phase from that in the easterly phase (Holton and Tan 1980; Pascoe et al. 2005; Inoue et al. 2011; Yamashita et al. 2011; Watson and Gray 2014). Our simulated differences in the mean zonal winds between the westerly and easterly QBO phases at high latitudes of the northern hemisphere in Fig.  1 c have different signs at different altitudes. In the troposphere and lower stratosphere, Fig.  1 c shows higher eastward velocities at high latitudes of the northern hemisphere during the westerly QBO phase, which corresponds to the traditional Holton-Tan effect (Holton and Tan 1980; Inoue et al. 2011). Above altitude 30 km, Fig.  1 c reveals increases and decreases in the mean zonal winds at middle and high latitudes during the westerly QBO phase. Some discrepancies between Fig.  1 c and previous studies may arise from the MUAM deficiencies in the troposphere and lower stratosphere and from detection of QBO phases at different altitudes in different studies (see “Methods”).|$|E
40|$|Data {{assimilation}} is {{a promising}} approach to obtain climate reconstructions {{that are both}} consistent with observations {{of the past and}} with our understanding of the physics of the climate system as represented in the climate model used. Here, we investigate the use of ensemble square root filtering (EnSRF) – a technique used in weather forecasting – for climate reconstructions. We constrain an ensemble of 29 simulations from an atmosphere-only general circulation model (GCM) with 37 pseudo-proxy temperature time series. Assimilating spatially sparse information with low temporal resolution (semi-annual) improves the representation of not only temperature, but also other surface properties, such as precipitation and even upper air features such as the intensity of the <b>northern</b> stratospheric <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> or the strength of the northern subtropical jet. Given the sparsity of the assimilated information and the limited size of the ensemble used, a localisation procedure is crucial to reduce "overcorrection" of climate variables far away from the assimilated information...|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} transport model, {{which uses}} winds from a stratospheric data assimilation system, {{is used to}} study the transport of supersonic aircraft exhaust in the lower stratosphere. A passive tracer is continuously injected into the transport model. The tracer source distribution is based on realistic scenarios for the daily emission rate of reactive nitrogen species for all forecasted flight routes. Winds are from northern hemisphere winter/spring months for 1979 and 1989; there are minimal differences between the tracer integrations for the 2 years. During the integration, peak tracer mixing ratios in the flight corridors are compared with the zonal mean and found to be greater {{by a factor of}} 2 or less. This implies that the zonal mean assumption used in two dimensional models is reasonable during winter and spring. There is a preference for pollutant buildup in the heavily traveled North Pacific and North Atlantic flight corridors. Pollutant concentration in the corridors depends on the position of the Aleutian anticyclone and the <b>northern</b> hemisphere <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> edge...|$|R
40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the strength of}} the Northern Hemisphere Holton-Tan effect (HTE) in terms of the phase alignment of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) with respect to the annual cycle. Using the ERA- 40 Reanalysis, it is found that the early winter (Nov–Dec) and late winter (Feb–Mar) relation between QBO phase and {{the strength of the}} stratospheric <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> is optimized for subsets of the 44 -year record that are chosen {{on the basis of the}} seasonality of QBO phase transitions at the 30 hPa level. The timing of phase transitions serves as a proxy for changes in the vertical structure of the QBO over the whole depth of the tropical stratosphere. The statistical significance of the Nov–Dec (Feb–Mar) HTE is greatest when 30 hPa QBO phase transitions occur 9 – 14 (4 – 9) months prior to the January of the NH winter in question. This suggests that there exists for both early and late winter a vertical structure of tropical stratospheric winds that is most effective at influencing the interannual variability of the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex,</b> and that an early (late) winter HTE is associated with an early (late) progression of QBO phase towards that structure. It is also shown that the seasonality of QBO phase transitions at 30 hPa varies on a decadal timescale, with transitions during the first half of the calendar year being relatively more common during the first half of the tropical radiosonde wind record. Combining these two results suggests that decadal changes in HTE strength could result from the changing seasonality of QBO phase transitions. Citation: Anstey, J. A., and T. G.

40|$|Polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) {{measurements}} {{have been}} taken {{by means of a}} lidar system at the German Koldewey Station in Ny-Ålesund, Spitsbergen [79 °N, 12 °E], since 1988. Here we present the first PSC climatology for the high Arctic built on Ny-Ålesund lidar data collected from winter 1995 / 1996 to 2003 / 2004, thus avoiding the effects of earlierbackground aerosol enhancement by large volcanic eruptions. As in a similar study performed on the Antarctic McMurdo PSC dataset, a numerical code has been applied to distinguish PSCs based on their vertical structure displayed on the lidar profile. Two cloud categories showing low or high variability of backscattering ratio with altitude are individuated andaddressed as Large and Small Scale Variation PSCs (LSV and SSV, respectively). It is possible to make reliable assumptions concerning the relationship between the obtained PSCcategories and the conditions under which they are likely to form. Ny-Ålesund is typically situated in the centre of the <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex,</b> where the majority of PSC observations can be linked to the synoptic temperature field. The present study not only provides a general description of PSCs occurring at Ny-Ålesund, but it also focuses on the temporal and spatialvariability of cloud types observed under both LSV and SSV categories.

40|$|Using a {{state-of-the-art}} chemistry-climate model, we analyzed the atmospheric responses {{to increases in}} sea surface temperature (SST). The results showed that increases in SST and the SST meridional gradient could intensify the subtropical westerly jets and significantly weaken the <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex.</b> In the model runs, global uniform SST increases produced a more {{significant impact on the}} southern stratosphere than the northern stratosphere, while SST gradient increases produced a more significant impact on the northern stratosphere. The asymmetric responses of the northern and southern polar stratosphere to SST meridional gradient changes were found to be mainly due to different wave properties and transmissions in the northern and southern atmosphere. Although SST increases may give rise to stronger waves, the results showed that the effect of SST increases on the vertical propagation of tropospheric waves into the stratosphere will vary with height and latitude and be sensitive to SST meridional gradient changes. Both uniform and non-uniform SST increases accelerated the large-scale Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC), but the gradient increases of SST between 60 °S and 60 °N resulted in younger mean age-of-air in the stratosphere and a larger increase in tropical upwelling, with a much higher tropopause than from a global uniform 1. 0 K SST increase. © 2014 Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of reduced solar forcing (grand solar minimum or geoengineering scenarios like solar radiation management) on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is assessed in an ensemble of atmosphere–ocean–chemistry–climate model simulations. Ensemble sensitivity simulations are performed {{with and without}} interactive chemistry. In both experiments the AMOC is intensified {{in the course of}} the solar radiation reduction, which is attributed to the thermal effect of the solar forcing: reduced sea surface temperatures and enhanced sea ice formation increase the density of the upper ocean in the North Atlantic and intensify the deepwater formation. Furthermore, a second, dynamical effect on the AMOC is identified driven by the stratospheric cooling in response to the reduced solar forcing. The cooling is strongest in the tropics and leads to a weakening of the <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex.</b> By stratosphere–troposphere interactions, the stratospheric circulation anomalies induce a negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation in the troposphere which is found to weaken the AMOC through wind stress and heat flux anomalies in the North Atlantic. The dynamic mechanism is present in both ensemble experiments. In the experiment with interactive chemistry, however, it is strongly amplified by stratospheric ozone changes. In the coupled system, both effects counteract and weaken the response of the AMOC to the solar forcing reduction. Neglecting chemistry–climate interactions in model simulations may therefore lead to an overestimation of the AMOC response to solar forcing...|$|E

Here we analyze the QBO signal in the <b>Northern</b> Hemisphere <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> in a model simulation using the general circulation model MAECHAM 5 (Middle Atmosphere European Center Hamburg Model), which simulates the QBO as an internal mode of variability. Composites have been computed for the westerly and easterly QBO phases from early winter to late winter (November December, December - January and January - February) of a 50 -year experiment containing 20 complete QBO cycles. This method identifies tropical and midlatitude patterns in wind and temperature {{that are related to}} the secondary meridional circulation of the QBO extending towards the winter pole. In the tropics, significant QBO signature is observed in the mesosphere up to 0. 05 hPa only in early winter and mainly in the easterly QBO phase forced by the parameterized gravity waves-mean flow interaction. At high latitudes, MAECHAM 5 shows a significantly warmer (colder) polar stratosphere in the easterly (westerly) QBO phase at 30 hPa accompanied by a weaker (stronger) <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> in the late winter months, from December to February (December to January) in the easterly (westerly) phase of the QBO. In early winter there is no significant change in temperature and zonal mean zonal wind in the polar stratosphere.

40|$|This study {{provides}} a mechanistic {{explanation of why}} the Holton-Tan (HT) effect, a phenomenon in which the strength of <b>northern</b> stratospheric winter <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> synchronizes with the equatorial quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), was disrupted in the middle to late winters of 1978 – 1997. In line with recent reassessments of the HT effect, we find that an easterly QBO in the lower stratosphere leads {{to the formation of}} a midlatitude wave guide that enhances both the upward propagating planetary waves from the troposphere into the lower stratosphere (~ 35 – 50 °N, 30 – 200 [*]hPa) and the northward wave propagation in the upper to middle stratosphere (~ 35 – 60 °N, 20 – 5 [*]hPa). This enhanced poleward refraction of planetary waves results in a more disturbed <b>polar</b> <b>vortex,</b> causing the HT effect. The weakening of the HT effect in 1978 – 1997 was associated with a broader and strengthened <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> in November to January. The divergence of wave activity generated by eddies growing within the vortex provided the momentum source and allowed wave activity to propagate meridionally away from the vortex; this interfered with the QBO modulation of planetary wave propagation and led to a weakening of the HT effect during this period. The stronger than average <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> in 1978 – 1997 was associated with a vertically coherent cooling signature over northeastern Asia in the stratosphere.

By mid-August, near the time of peak ClO, abundances of gas-phase HNO 3 and H 2 O were extremely low. The concentrations of HNO 3 and H 2 O over Antarctica remained depressed into November, well after temperatures in the lower stratosphere had risen above the evaporation threshold for polar stratospheric clouds, implying that denitrification and dehydration had occurred. No large decreases in either gas-phase HNO 3 or H 2 O were observed in the 1992 - 1993 Arctic winter vortex. Although ClO was enhanced over the Arctic as it was over the Antarctic, Arctic O 3 depletion was substantially smaller than that over Antarctica.

The ER- 2 Condensation Nucleus Counter (CNC) measures the number concentration of particles in the diameter range of approximately 0. 01 to 1 micron. The Passive Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer measures size distributions in the 0. 17 to 3 micron diameter range. This instrument was upgraded during this grant period to a Focused Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer (FCAS). This upgrade permitted the instrument to measure particles as small as 0. 05 micron in diameter. The inlet for the PCAS and FCAS was modified and characterized under this grant so that the modifications to the aerosol due to anisokinetic sampling and heating upon sampling and in transport to the measurement location were accounted for in the data analysis. These measurements permitted observations of particle production in the southern hemisphere winter polar vortex and observation of the impact of denitrification on the number concentration of the aerosol in the denitrified air. In the <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex,</b> the measurements provided a characterization of the sulfate aerosol.

The typical Arctic PSC season extends only from late November to early March, with a peak zonal average probability of about 0. 1 in early February at 20 - 22 km.

Inferred PSC formation temperatures remain constant throughout the Arctic winter and are similar to those in early Antarctic winter.

We find that for both the Tambora and the averaged Krakatau-Pinatubo eruptions the radiative perturbation only weakly affects the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> directly. The position of the maximum temperature anomaly gradient is located at approximately 30 °N, where we obtain significant westerly zonal wind anomalies between 10 hPa and 30 hPa. Under the very strong forcing of the Tambora eruption, the NH <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> is significantly strengthened because the subtropical westerly wind anomalies are sufficiently strong to robustly alter the propagation of planetary waves. The average response to the eruptions of Krakatau and Pinatubo reveals a slight strengthening of the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex,</b> but individual ensemble members differ substantially, indicating that internal variability plays a dominant role. For the Tambora eruption the ensemble variability of the zonal mean temperature and zonal wind anomalies during midwinter and late winter is significantly reduced compared to the volcanically unperturbed period...|$|R
40|$|Diagnostics of wave-mean-flow and wave-wave {{interactions}} in isentropic coordinates are analyzed regarding the mechanisms {{that govern the}} Holton-Tan effect (HTE), whereby the tropical quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) modulates the <b>northern</b> winter stratospheric <b>polar</b> <b>vortex.</b> We find a clear seasonal evolution of a QBO modulation of Rossby waves and linear and nonlinear wave interactions, along with multiple mechanisms at work. In early winter, when the lower stratospheric QBO is easterly, there is enhanced upward stationary planetary-wave activity in the subtropical to midlatitude lower stratosphere. These upward-propagating waves are first refracted toward the zero-wind line. Approximately 1 [*]month later, poleward-propagating wave anomalies appear at midlatitudes {{as a result of}} nonlinear wave interactions. The enhanced upward wave propagation appears to be due to a combination of the QBO influence on the latitudinal location of the zero-wind line and the increased midlatitude baroclinicity associated with the QBO-induced meridional circulation. This is further aided by a gradual poleward shift over the winter of the middle-stratospheric waveguide, refracting waves poleward. The associated wave breaking weakens the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> and drives a stronger meridional circulation throughout the lower to middle stratosphere, contributing to the high-latitude warming. It is additionally found that in late winter, the modified high-latitude waveguide associated with the weaker <b>polar</b> <b>vortex,</b> consequently reduces upward-propagating transient planetary waves at high latitudes while simultaneously enhancing upward-propagating synoptic waves at midlatitudes. This highlights the need to view the HTE and its mechanisms as an evolving phenomenon throughout the winte...|$|R
40|$|Total ozone {{observations}} from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instruments during March 1997 revealed an extensive region of low column densities in the Arctic region centered near the north pole. Values were below 250 Dobson units {{for nearly a}} two week period during this period, and were correlated with {{the position of the}} <b>northern</b> lower stratospheric <b>polar</b> <b>vortex.</b> The March 1997 average total ozone column densities were more than 30 % lower than the average of column densities observed during the 1979 - 1982 March period. Both the northern spring seasons of 1998 and 1999 have shown much higher levels of total ozone. In this presentation, we will discuss the causes of the low total ozone values in 1997 and contrast those low values with the higher 1998 and 1999 observations. I will additionally discuss the just completed SOLVE campaign and the March 2000 ozone values...|$|R
40|$|The newly {{developed}} atmosphere–ocean–chemistry–climate model SOCOL-MPIOM is presented by demonstrating {{the influence of}} chemistry–climate interactions on the climate state and the variability. Therefore, we compare pre-industrial control simulations with (CHEM) and without (NOCHEM) interactive chemistry. In general, {{the influence of the}} chemistry on the mean state and the variability is small and mainly restricted to the stratosphere and mesosphere. The atmospheric dynamics mainly differ in polar regions, with slightly stronger polar vortices in the austral and boreal winter, respectively. The strengthening of the vortex is related to larger stratospheric temperature gradients, which are attributed to a parameterisation of the absorption of ozone and oxygen in different wavelength intervals, which is considered in the version with interactive chemistry only. A second reason for the temperature differences between CHEM and NOCHEM is related to diurnal variations in the ozone concentrations in the higher atmosphere, which are missing in NOCHEM. Furthermore, stratospheric water vapour concentrations substantially differ between the two experiments, but their effect on temperature is small. In both setups, the simulated intensity and variability of the <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> is inside the range of present-day observations. Additionally, the performance of SOCOL-MPIOM under changing external forcings is assessed for the period 1600 – 2000 using an ensemble of simulations. In the industrial period from 1850 onward SOCOL-MPIOM overestimates the global mean surface air temperature increase in comparison to observational data sets. Sensitivity simulations show that this overestimation can be attributed to a combination of factors: the solar forcing reconstruction, the simulated ozone changes, and incomplete aerosol effects and land use changes...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} for {{the first}} time that total ozone in the martian atmosphere is highly correlated with the dynamical tracer, potential vorticity, under certain conditions. The degree of correlation is investigated using a Mars global circulation model including a photochemical model. Potential vorticity is the quantity of choice to explore the dynamical nature of polar vortices because it contains information on winds and temperature in a single scalar variable. The correlation is found to display a distinct seasonal variation, with a strong positive correlation in both northern and southern winter at poleward latitudes in the northern and southern hemisphere respectively. The identified strong correlation implies variations in polar total ozone during winter are predominantly controlled by dynamical processes in these spatio-temporal regions. The weak correlation in northern and southern summer is due to the dominance of photochemical reactions resulting from extended exposure to sunlight. The total ozone/potential vorticity correlation is slightly weaker in southern winter due to topographical variations and the preference for ozone to accumulate in Hellas basin. In northern winter, total ozone can be used to track the polar vortex edge. The ozone/potential vorticity ratio is calculated for both northern and southern winter on Mars {{for the first}} time. Using the strong correlation in total ozone and potential vorticity in northern winter inside the polar vortex, it is shown that potential vorticity can be used as a proxy to deduce the distribution of total ozone where satellites cannot observe for the majority of northern winter. Where total ozone observations are available on the fringes of northern winter at poleward latitudes, the strong relationship of total ozone and potential vorticity implies that total ozone anomalies in the surf zone of the <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> can potentially be used to determine the origin of potential vorticity filaments...|$|E
40|$|Interannual-to-decadal {{variability}} in stratospheric ozone and climate {{have a number}} of common sources, such as variations in solar irradiance, stratospheric aerosol loading due to volcanic eruptions, El Niño Southern Oscillation variability and the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). Currently available data records as well as model simulations addressing stratospheric chemical climate variability mostly cover only the past few decades, which is often insufficient to address natural interannual-to-decadal variability. Here we make use of recently reconstructed and re-evaluated data products to force and validate transient ensemble model simulations (nine members) across the twentieth century computed by means of the chemistry-climate model SOCOL (SOlar Climate Ozone Links). The forcings include sea surface temperatures, sea ice, solar irradiance, stratospheric aerosols, QBO, changes in land properties, greenhouse gases, ozone depleting substances, and emissions of carbon monoxides, and nitrogen oxides. The transient simulations are in good agreement with observations, reconstructions and reanalyses and allow quantification of interannual-to-decadal variability during the 20 th century. All ensemble members are able to capture the low-frequency {{variability in}} tropical and mid-latitude total ozone {{as well as in the}} strength of the subtropical jet, suggesting a realistic response to external forcings in this area. The region of the <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> exhibits a large internal variability that is found in the frequency, seasonality, and strength of major warmings as well as in the strength of the modeled polar vortex. Results from process-oriented analysis, such as correlation between the vertical Eliassen Palm flux (EP flux) component and polar variables as well as stratospheric ozone trends, are of comparable magnitude to those observed and are consistent in all analysed ensemble members. Yet, trend estimates of the vertical EP flux component vary greatly among ensemble members precluding any robust conclusions. This suggests that internal variability in models must be accounted for in order to quantify the atmospheric model response in wave energy upon external forcings...|$|E
40|$|After major {{volcanic}} eruptions the enhanced aerosol causes ozone changes due to greater heterogeneous chemistry on the particle surfaces (HET-AER) and from dynamical effects {{related to the}} radiative heating of the lower stratosphere (RAD-DYN). We carry {{out a series of}} experiments with an atmosphere–ocean–chemistry–climate model to assess how these two processes change stratospheric ozone and <b>Northern</b> Hemispheric (NH) <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> dynamics. Ensemble simulations are performed under present day and preindustrial conditions, and with aerosol forcings representative of different eruption strength, to investigate changes in the response behaviour. We show that the halogen component of the HET-AER effect dominates under present-day conditions with a global reduction of ozone (− 21 DU for the strongest eruption) particularly at high latitudes, whereas the HET-AER effect increases stratospheric ozone due to N 2 O 5 hydrolysis in a preindustrial atmosphere (maximum anomalies + 4 DU). The halogen-induced ozone changes in the present-day atmosphere offset part of the strengthening of the NH <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> during mid-winter (reduction of up to − 16 m s - 1 in January) and slightly amplify the dynamical changes in the polar stratosphere in late winter (+ 11 m s - 1 in March). The RAD-DYN mechanism leads to positive column ozone anomalies which are reduced in a present-day atmosphere by amplified polar ozone depletion (maximum anomalies + 12 and + 18 DU for present day and preindustrial, respectively). For preindustrial conditions, the ozone response is consequently dominated by RAD-DYN processes, while under present-day conditions, HET-AER effects dominate. The dynamical response of the stratosphere is dominated by the RAD-DYN mechanism showing an intensification of the NH <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> in winter (up to + 10 m s - 1 in January). Ozone changes due to the RAD-DYN mechanism slightly reduce the response of the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> after the eruption under present-day conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) on the <b>Northern</b> Hemisphere (NH) <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> response to warm El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events {{and the impact of}} the warm ENSO events on the QBO signal in the NH polar stratosphere have been analyzed using the Middle Atmosphere ECHAM 5 model. The experiment setup was designed to include simulations of extended NH winter seasons for either strong easterly or strong westerly phases of the tropical QBO, forced with either sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from the strong ENSO event that occurred in 1997 / 1998 or with climatological SSTs. It has been found that the weakening and warming of the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> associated with a warm ENSO are intensified {{at the end of the}} winter during both QBO phases. In addition, the westerly QBO phase delays the onset of the warm ENSO signal, while the easterly QBO phase advances it. Warm ENSO events also impact the extratropical signal of the QBO by intensifying (weakening) the QBO effects in early (late) winter. Therefore, it appears that during warm ENSO events the duration of QBO signal in the northern extratropics is shortened while its downward propagation accelerated. Our dynamical analysis has revealed that these results are due to changes in the background flow caused by the QBO combined with changes in the anomalous propagation and dissipation of extratropical waves generated by warm ENSO. In both cases, a nonlinear behavior in the response of the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> is observed when both warm ENSO and the easterly phase of the QBO operate together. These results suggest that the Arctic <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> response to combined forcing factors, in our case warm ENSO and the QBO phenomena, is expected to be nonlinear also for other coexistent forcing factors able to affect the variability of the vortex in the stratosphere...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Northern</b> Hemisphere stratospheric <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> {{is linked}} to surface weather. After Stratospheric Sudden Warmings in winter, the tropospheric {{circulation}} is often nudged towards the negative phase of the Northern Annular Mode (NAM) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). A strong stratospheric vortex {{is often associated with}} subsequent positive NAM/NAO conditions. For stratosphere–troposphere associations to be useful for forecasting purposes it is crucial that changes to the stratospheric vortex can be understood and predicted. Recent studies have proposed that there exist tropospheric precursors to anomalous vortex events in the stratosphere and that these precursors may be understood by considering the relationship between stationary wave patterns and regional variability. Another important factor {{is the extent to which}} the inherent variability of the stratosphere in an atmospheric model influences its ability to simulate stratosphere–troposphere links. Here we examine the lower stratosphere variability in 300 -year pre-industrial control integrations from 13 coupled climate models. We show that robust precursors to stratospheric <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> anomalies are evident across the multi-model ensemble. The most significant tropospheric component of these precursors consists of a height anomaly dipole across northern Eurasia and large anomalies in upward stationary wave fluxes in the lower stratosphere over the continent. The strength of the stratospheric variability in the models was found to depend on the variability of the upward stationary wave fluxes and the amplitude of the stationary waves...|$|R
