5|$|On 6 January 2006, the Regional Public Prosecutor in Viborg {{discontinued}} {{the investigation}} as he found <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> {{concluding that the}} cartoons constituted a criminal offence because the publication concerned a subject of public interest and Danish case law extends editorial freedom to journalists regarding subjects of public interest. He stated that in assessing what constitutes an offence, the right to freedom of speech {{must be taken into}} consideration, and said that freedom of speech must be exercised with the necessary respect for other human rights, including the right to protection against discrimination, insult and degradation. In a new hearing resulting from a complaint about the original decision, the Director of Public Prosecutors in Denmark agreed with the previous ruling.|$|E

25|$|Perry {{had also}} {{properly}} denied the defense motion to suppress evidence obtained via the search warrants of Lazarus's home, cars and workspaces, according to Manella, {{since they were}} based on reasonable assumptions about possibly incriminating evidence that might still be in those places over two decades after the crime—again, supported by existing state and federal case law. And since none of {{the information in the}} search-warrant affidavit was known to be false or shown to have been stated with reckless disregard for its truth, the good-faith exception was validly applied. For the same reason, there was <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> a Franks hearing.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by {{success in}} the battle of Agrigentum, the Romans sought to win all of Sicily, but {{required}} naval power to do so. In order to challenge the already prominent Carthaginian naval forces, Rome built a fleet of one hundred quinqueremes and twenty triremes. The famous Greek historian Polybius wrote that Rome used a wrecked Carthaginian quinquereme captured at Messina {{as a model for the}} entire fleet, and that the Romans would have otherwise had <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> design. However, this may have been an exaggeration, as the Romans had also borrowed Greek quinqueremes previously in 264.|$|E
25|$|In {{organisms that}} {{maintain}} a constant shape and have one dimension {{longer than the}} other, at least two directional terms can be used. The long or longitudinal axis is defined by points at the {{opposite ends of the}} organism. Similarly, a perpendicular transverse axis can be defined by points {{on opposite sides of the}} organism. There is typically <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the definition of a third axis. Usually such organisms are planktonic (free-swimming) protists, and are nearly always viewed on microscope slides, where they appear essentially two-dimensional. In some cases a third axis can be defined, particularly where a non-terminal cytostome or other unique structure is present.|$|E

25|$|I {{have come}} to the clear {{conclusion}} that there is no basis upon which there should be a further Judicial Inquiry or a reopening of Lord Taylor's Inquiry. There is <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> a renewed application to the Divisional Court or for the Attorney General to exercise his powers under the Coroners Act 1988. I do not consider that there is any material which should be put before the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have already taken. Nor do I consider that there is any justification for setting up any further inquiry into the performance of the emergency and hospital services. I have considered the circumstances in which alterations were made to some of the self-written statements of South Yorkshire Police officers, but I do not consider that there is any occasion for any further investigation.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{scholarship}} has been guided by two competing theories in the historiography of Champa. Scholars agree that historically Champa {{was divided into}} several regions or principalities spread out from south to north {{along the coast of}} modern Vietnam and united by a common language, culture, and heritage. It is acknowledged that the historical record is not equally rich for each of the regions in every historical period. For example, in the 10th century, the record is richest for Indrapura; in the 12th century, it is richest for Vijaya; following the 15th century, it is richest for Panduranga. Some scholars have taken these shifts in the historical record to reflect the movement of the Cham capital from one location to another. According to such scholars, if the 10th-century record is richest for Indrapura, it is so because at that time Indrapura was the capital of Champa. Other scholars have disputed this contention, holding that Champa was never a united country, and arguing that the presence of a particularly rich historical record for a given region in a given period is <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> claiming that the region functioned as the capital of a united Champa during that period.|$|E
25|$|The Second Circuit Court of Appeals {{overturned}} in 3-0 {{ruling on}} July 17, 2013 Judge’s Forrest ruling which struck down § 1021(b)(2) {{of the controversial}} U.S. military-detention law NDAA as unconstitutional because the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to challenge it. The Court of Appeals overturned Forrest’s decision in a 60-page ruling and lifted her injunction, saying that Christopher Hedges and another plaintiff weren’t eligible to challenge the law because it “simply says nothing about the government’s authority to detain citizens.” The court held that under their interpretation the government could not use the particular law challenged by the citizen plaintiffs to militarily detain them, so they had <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the court to hear their case. But the court acknowledged that this doesn’t mean that the government could not rely on other laws, including the AUMF {{to the events of}} September 11, to justify indefinite military detention of citizens. The court concluded that the non-citizen plaintiffs had no reasonable fear of being detained and thus could not have their challenge of the law adjudicated by the court. “And while Section 1021 does have a real bearing on those who are neither citizens nor lawful resident aliens and who are apprehended abroad, the non-citizen plaintiffs also have failed to establish standing because they have not shown a sufficient threat that the government will detain them under Section 1021,” the court said.|$|E

The Ordnance Department concurred, but added on 1,000 T23 series tanks, an advanced design handicapped by problems with the reliability of its electric transmission. McNair disapproved the request, writing that [...] "the M4 tank, particularly the M4A3, has been widely hailed as the best tank on the battlefield today... Other than this particular request, which represents the British view—there has been no call from any theater for a 90mm tank gun. There appears to be no fear on the part of our forces of the German Mark VI (Tiger) tank... there can be <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the T26 tank other than the conception of a tank versus tank duel—which is believed unsound and unnecessary... {{there is no indication that}} the 76mm antitank gun is inadequate against the Mark VI (Tiger) tank." ...|$|E
