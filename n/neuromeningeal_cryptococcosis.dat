PATIENTS, MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included all patients diagnosed with <b>neuromeningeal</b> <b>cryptococcosis</b> for which the presence of the fungi was observed on microscopic examination of cerebrospinal fluid after staining with Indian ink. Data were collected from the registers of the clinical service and from the laboratory of the university hospital center of Bobo Dioulasso. RESULTS: The prevalence of <b>neuromeningeal</b> <b>cryptococcosis</b> was 1. 8 % (61 / 5129). A decrease in the prevalence was observed from 2002 to 2010 (3. 1 %, to 0. 2 %). This decrease occurred even though the number of patients treated with antiretroviral drugs increase. Headaches were the predominant clinical signs (81. 9 %). The CD 4 median count was 56 /mm(3). All patients were successfully treated with fluconazole in relay to amphotericin B intravenous. Lethality rate is 27. 8 %. CONCLUSION: The overall prevalence of 1. 8 % of <b>neuromeningeal</b> <b>cryptococcosis</b> observed in this study was lower than that in previous studies in the same laboratory in 2001. The arrival of antiretroviral drugs could have contributed to the decline in {{the prevalence of}} <b>neuromeningeal</b> <b>cryptococcosis</b> in this study...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{extent of}} <b>neuromeningeal</b> <b>cryptococcosis</b> (NMC) has {{increased}} {{since the advent}} of HIV/AIDS. It has non-specific clinical signs but marked by high mortality. Objective: To analyze the characteristics of the NMC in sub-Saharan Africa. Materials and Methods: We have conducted a literature reviewed on the NMC in sub-Saharan Africa from the publications available on the basis of national and international data with keywords such as "Cryptococcus, Epidemiology, Symptoms, Outcomes and Mortality" and their equivalent in French in July 2011. All publications from 1990 to 2010 with 202 references were analyzed. The following results are the means of different studied variables. Results: We selected in final 43 publications dealing with the NMC which 24 involved 17 countries in Africa. The average age was 36 years old. The average prevalence was 3. 41 % and the average incidence was 10. 48 % (range 6. 90 % to 12 %). The most common signs were fever (75 %), headaches (62. 50 %) and impaired consciousness. Meningeal signs were present in 49 % of cases. The mean CD 4 count was 44. 8 cells/mm 3. The India ink and latex agglutination tests were the most sensitive. The average time before the consultation and the hospital stay was almost identical to 27. 71 days. The average death rate was 45. 90 %. Fluconazole has been the most commonly used molecule. Conclusion: The epidemiological indicators of NMC varied more depending on the region of sub-Saharan Africa. Early and effective taking care of patients to reduce diagnostic delay and heavy mortality remains the challenges...|$|E
40|$|Cryptococcal {{meningitis}} is {{the most}} common fatal central nervous system infection in AIDS patients in Sub-Saharan Africa. The purpose of this prospective study conducted from March 2003 to February 2004 in the internal medicine and infectious diseases departments of the Point G University Hospital Center was to investigate the clinical, prognostic and epidemiological profile of Cryptococcus neoformans infection in patients hospitalized for brain and meningeale infection (BMI). Diagnosis of <b>neuromeningeal</b> <b>cryptococcosis</b> (NMC) was based on positive identification of Cryptococcus by direct exam of the cebrospinal fluid (CSF) after India ink staining and/or culture on Sabouraud medium without actidione. During the study period, a total of 569 patients were hospitalized including 235 (41. 3 %) with HIV infection. Overall C. neoformans was identified in 14 patients. Median patient age was 39 Â± 8 years. There was a male preponderance with a sex ratio of 1. 8 (9 men/ 5 women). Patients with BMI were HIV positive in 85. 7 % of cases (n= 12) and HIV-negative in 14. 3 % (n= 2). The overall and HIV-specific prevalence of BMI was 2. 5 % and 5. 1 % respectively. The CD 4 lymphocyte count was between 1 and 49 cells/mm 3 in 64. 3 % of cases. The main clinical symptoms were cephalea in 85. 7 % of cases, altered consciousness in 50 % and nausea/vomiting in 35. 7 %. Neurological manifestations (hemiparesis and cranial nerve deficit) were noted in 14. 3 %. HIV infection is the main purveyor of NMC in Mali. The actual incidence of cryptococcosis is unclear due to the poor sensitivity of diagnostic techniques. This study highlights diagnostic difficulties related to clinical polymorphism and poor technical facilities. Agglutination testing of blood and CSF is recommended, but mortality remains...|$|E
