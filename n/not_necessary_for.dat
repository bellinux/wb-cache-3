5|$|A {{more radical}} {{development}} was the synthesis in 2006 of bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene by Bertrand's group. In this compound, which is stable at room temperature, the carbene atom {{is connected to}} two carbon atoms, in a three-member ring that retains the aromaticity and geometry of the cyclopropenylidene ring. This example demonstrated {{that the presence of}} heteroatoms next to the carbene is <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> stability, either.|$|E

5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, battle was <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> either side; the main strategic theatre was mainland Greece itself. Although destroying the enemy navy {{would result in}} a clear strategic advantage for both sides, attempting this risked the loss of their own navy. The actions of the two sides thus reflect more upon their morale and confidence than on any strategic considerations. The Persians, seeing little to gain in battle, demoralised and riven with dissent, thus sought to avoid a naval battle. Conversely, the Allies, who had initially been as nervous of a battle as the Persians, sought to press home their morale advantage once they were informed {{of the state of the}} Persian fleet.|$|E

Tucker assists Erickson with the test, but is brushed aside when he seeks {{to learn more about the}} technology.

5|$|The first acyclic {{persistent}} carbene {{was reported}} in 1996, thus showing that a cyclic backbone was <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> their stability. Unlike the cyclic derivatives, the acyclic carbenes are flexible with respect to rotation of the bonds to the carbenic atom. By measuring the barrier to rotation of these bonds, {{the extent of their}} double bond character could be measured, and the ylidic nature of this carbene could be determined. Like the cyclic diaminocarbenes, unhindered variants tend to dimerise.|$|E
5|$|There {{were several}} {{differences}} between Sullivan's adaptation and Stevenson's novella. Stevenson used multiple narrators and a circular narrative (allowing material {{presented at the}} end to explain material presented at the beginning), but Sullivan wrote a linear narrative in chronological order. This linear approach and the onstage action conveyed a stronger impression of realism, eliminating uncertainties in Stevenson's narrative. Although making the story more straightforward and less ambiguous was <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> a theatrical adaptation, Sullivan's approach {{was typical of the}} era's stage melodramas and made the material more acceptable to audiences. The stage presentation's realism also allowed Sullivan to drop the novella's scientific aspects. Although Stevenson used science to make the Jekyll-Hyde transformation plausible to readers, Sullivan could rely on the onstage transformation.|$|E

He is credited with being largely responsible for taking the lead on an asylum policy overhaul after the arson attack by neo-Nazis in Mölln, in which three Turkish citizens died in 1993. He also earned recognition at home and abroad for attending memorial services for the victims of neo-Nazi attacks in Mölln and Solingen. The services were snubbed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who dismayed many Germans by saying it was <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> the government to send a representative.|$|E

5|$|Within the APOA5 gene, {{a couple}} of {{important}} SNPs with a widely confirmed effect on plasma TG levels as well as rare mutations have been described. In Caucasians, the common variants are inherited mostly in three haplotypes, which are characterised by two SNPs, namely rs662799 (T-1131˃C; in almost complete LD with A-3˃G, where the minor allele is associated with about 50% lower gene expression) and rs3135506 (Ser19˃Trp; C56˃G; alters the signal peptide and influences APOA5 secretion into plasma). There are also a further three common variants (A-3˃G, IVS+476 G˃A and T1259˃C) which are <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> haplotype characterisation.|$|E
5|$|In each level, {{the player}} may come across one other player {{temporarily}} connected to their game. When players approach each other they charge one another's scarves. They cannot {{communicate with each}} other beyond patterns of singing. Players can help each other by activating strips of cloth or showing paths, but cannot hinder each other and are <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> completing any level. When two players finish a section {{at the same time they}} remain together into the next one; otherwise they are connected to new players when they move on. While all of the figures generally look the same, without distinguishing characteristics, individual players can be told apart by unique symbols which are shown floating in the air when they sing and are displayed on their robes at all times. The entire game takes about two to three hours to complete.|$|E
5|$|Males’ {{differential}} {{recognition of}} local and nonlocal songs has been studied in two populations: one in the northern United States (New Hampshire) {{and the other in}} the southern United States (North Carolina). An asymmetry of response has been found between the two populations. The northern black-throated blue warbler responds strongly to local songs but relatively weakly to the song of southern warblers. In contrast, a warbler from the south responds equally to songs from both the north and the south. A potential explanation of this asymmetry is the difference in female preference between the northern and southern black-throated blue warblers. Females from the north are less likely to mate with a “heterospecific” male from the south; therefore it is <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> a northern male to respond strongly to the song of a southern challenger. It is possible that a barrier to gene flow from south to north exists while a barrier to the reverse does not. Therefore, female choice of male songs is likely {{to play a role in}} gene flow and reproductive isolation, which may eventually lead to diversification.|$|E

5|$|Reformed Christians {{believe that}} {{immersion}} is <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> baptism to be properly performed, but that pouring or sprinkling are acceptable. Sprinkling {{is said to}} symbolize the sprinkling of the blood of Christ {{for the removal of}} the guilt of sin. Only ordained ministers are permitted to administer baptism in Reformed churches, contrary to the allowance for emergency baptism by midwives in Roman Catholic churches, though baptisms performed by non-ministers are generally considered valid. Reformed churches, while rejecting the baptismal ceremonies of the Roman Catholic church (such as the use of chrism, salt, and insufflation), accept the validity of baptisms performed with them on the basis that the substance of baptism remains. They do not rebaptize someone who has been baptized using these ceremonies because baptism is never to be repeated.|$|E
5|$|Theses 30–34 {{deal with}} the false {{certainty}} Luther believed the indulgence preachers offered Christians. Since no one knows whether a person is truly repentant, a letter assuring a person of his forgiveness is dangerous. In theses 35 and 36, he attacks the idea that an indulgence makes repentance unnecessary. This leads {{to the conclusion that}} the truly repentant person, who alone may benefit from the indulgence, has already received the only benefit the indulgence provides. Truly repentant Christians have already, according to Luther, been forgiven of the penalty as well as the guilt of sin. In thesis 37, he states that indulgences are <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> Christians to receive all the benefits provided by Christ. Theses 39 and 40 argue that indulgences make true repentance more difficult. True repentance desires God's punishment of sin, but indulgences teach one to avoid punishment, since that is the purpose of purchasing the indulgence.|$|E
