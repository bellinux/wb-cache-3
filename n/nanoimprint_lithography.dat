25|$|SAMs are an {{inexpensive}} and versatile surface coating for applications including control of wetting and adhesion, chemical resistance, bio compatibility, sensitization, and molecular recognition for sensors and nano fabrication. Areas of application for SAMs include biology, electrochemistry and electronics, nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and everyday household goods. SAMs {{can serve as}} models for studying membrane properties of cells and organelles and cell attachment on surfaces.

For example, the properties of SAMs can be used to control electron transfer in electrochemistry. They can serve to protect metals from harsh chemicals and etchants. SAMs can also reduce sticking of NEMS and MEMS components in humid environments. In the same way, SAMs can alter the properties of glass. A common household product, Rain-X, utilizes SAMs to create a hydrophobic monolayer on car windshields to keep them clear of rain. Another application is an anti-adhesion coating on <b>nanoimprint</b> <b>lithography</b> (NIL) tools and stamps.

30|$|The {{performance}} of {{organic solar cell}} is greatly determined by the nanoscale heterojunction morphology, and finding a practical method to achieve advantageous nanostructure remains a challenge. We demonstrate here that ordered bulk heterojunction (OBHJ) solar cell can be fabricated assisted by a simple, cost-effective <b>nanoimprinting</b> <b>lithography</b> method using patterned silk fibroin film mold at room temperature. The P 3 HT nanogratings were achieved by <b>nanoimprinting</b> <b>lithography</b> (NIL) process, and phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was spin-coated {{on the top of}} P 3 HT nanogratings. The conducting capacity of P 3 HT nanograting film has little difference compared with the unimprinted film in the vertical direction, due to the same edge-on chain alignment. However, it can be found that the fabrication of OBHJ nanostructure using room temperature NIL technique with patterned silk fibroin mold is able to promote optical absorption, interfacial area, and bicontinuous pathway. Therefore, the ordered heterojunction morphology plays an important part in improving device performance due to efficient exciton diffusion, dissociation, and reducing charge recombination rate.|$|R

50|$|A key {{characteristic}} of <b>nanoimprint</b> <b>lithography</b> (except for electrochemical nanoimprinting) is the residual layer following the imprint process. It {{is preferable to}} have thick enough residual layers to support alignment and throughput and low defects. However, this renders the <b>nanoimprint</b> <b>lithography</b> step less critical for critical dimension (CD) control than the etch step used to remove the residual layer. Hence, {{it is important to}} consider the residual layer removal an integrated part of the overall nanoimprint patterning process. In a sense, the residual layer etch is similar to the develop process in conventional lithography. It has been proposed to combine photolithography and <b>nanoimprint</b> <b>lithography</b> techniques in one step in order to eliminate the residual layer.|$|E
50|$|A unique {{benefit of}} <b>nanoimprint</b> <b>lithography</b> {{is the ability}} to pattern 3D structures, such as damascene {{interconnects}} and T-gates, in fewer steps than required for conventional lithography.

Lithography does not reduce the emission yields of light-emitting organic compounds, thus opening the way to the one-step realization of organic-based confined optoelectronic devices. We carefully investigated the possible changes in the optical properties (absorbance, luminescence, and quantum yield) of light-emitting species, thus ruling out any possible degradation of the active materials after patterning. In particular, the observed increase in the external luminescence yield is ascribed to the reduced self-absorption within the dielectric slab of the organic film, {{as a consequence of the}} pattern-induced enhanced forward scattering...|$|R

40|$|Well-tailored {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) ZnO nanowire architectures {{have been}} successfully grown on Si microtrenches fabricated using <b>nanoimprinting</b> <b>lithography</b> by a low-temperature hydrothermal approach. Au nanoparticles or ZnO nanofilms were used as templates to tailor the orientation ordered nanowire growth normal to the microtrench surface. Au produced sparse nanowire growth, while ZnO seeds created densely packed growth. Optically, other than displaying a primary color when viewed from one incident angle, the 3 D nanowire architecture periodically displayed multiple primary color domains covering all microtrenches and the local orientation ordered nanowire arrays. A pre-growth annealing of ZnO nanoseeds resulted in nonuniformity and non-periodic distribution of the grown nanoarchitectures and thus reduced the multicolor effect.

40|$|Polymeric systems {{involving}} polyelectrolytes in {{surfaces and}} interfaces, semiflexible polyelectrolytes and biopolymers in solution, complex polymeric systems that had applications in nanotechnology were modeled using coarse grained molecular dynamics simulation. In {{the area of}} polyelectrolytes in surfaces and interfaces, the phenomena of polyelectrolyte adsorption at oppositely charge surface was investigated. Simulations found that short range van der Waals interaction was {{a major factor in}} determining morphology and thickness of the adsorbed layer. Hydrophobic polyelectrolytes adsorbed in hydrophobic surfaces tend to be the most effective in forming multi-layers because short range attraction enhances the adsorption process. Adsorbed polyelectrolytes could move freely along the surface which was in contrast to polyelectrolyte brushes. The morphologies of hydrophobic polyelectrolyte brushes were investigated and simulations found that brushes had different morphologies depending on the strength of the short range monomer-monomer attraction, electrostatic interaction and counterion condensation. Planar polyelectrolyte brushes formed: (1) vertically oriented cylindrical aggregates, (2) maze-like aggregate structures, or (3) thin polymeric layer covering a substrate. While, the spherical polyelectrolyte brushes could be in any of the previous morphologies or be in a micelle-like conformation with a dense core and charged corona. ^ In the area of biopolymers and semiflexible polyelectrolytes in solution, simulations demonstrated that the bending rigidity of these polymers was scale-dependent. The bond-bond correlation function describing a chain 2 ̆ 7 s orientational memory could be approximated by a sum of two exponential functions manifesting the existence of the two characteristic length scales.

Among these techniques, thermal NIL is investigated as a promising method to define nanostructures due to its high resolution, effective cost, and simple process [10, 11].

Therefore, the control of nanoimprint mold is of great importance in the fabrication of OBHJ solar cell by NIL technique. Some traditional molds with high resolution over a large area, such as silicon mold or anodic aluminum oxide mold, are reported to apply; however, they are usually time-consuming, have complicated process, have simple fragility, crush or deformed easily, and do not to meet the need of commercial application.

The patterned ETFE template is produced by embossing ETFE film into a patterned silicon master and is used as template to transfer nanogratings during the SART-NIL process. It indicates that highly reproducible and well-controlled P 3 HT nanograting film is obtained successfully with feature size of nanogratings ranging from 130 to 700  nm, due to the flexibility, stiffness, and low surface energy of ETFE mold. Moreover, the SART-NIL method using ETFE mold is able to fabricate nanogratings but not to induce the change of molecular orientation within conjugated polymer. The conducting ability of P 3 HT nanograting in the vertical direction is also not damaged after patterning.
