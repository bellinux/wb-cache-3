40|$|This subject {{concerns}} the complex interrelationship of a genetically determined protein deficiency, enzymes which are inhibited by that protein, environmental challenges such as cigarette smoke and industrial pollutants, and {{the occurrence of}} obstructive lung disease (Fig. 1). Unequivocal establishment of an etiological role for AAT deficiency, especially of intermediate degree, {{has proven to be}} difficult. Confounding variables such as enzyme concentration in PMN and PAMs, duration of exposure to potential environmental hazards, differences in laboratory methods utilized in measuring AAT and in studying pulmonary function all require investigation. The definitive study, incorporating all of these and other factors, has yet to be conducted. <b>No</b> <b>single,</b> clear-cut <b>conclusion</b> can be drawn from analysis of present studies. In those circumstances in which heterozygotes appear to be predisposed to COPD, phenotypic screening of the population at potential risk, such as industrial workers may be appropriate.

40|$|Increase of {{capillary}} permeability is {{the chief}} symptomatic reaction of various pathologic states, especially that of localized inflammation, {{and this is the}} characteristic pharmacological properties of histamine at a far smaller concentration than that of any other chemical substances (Lewis, 1927; Crammer and Hele, 1944). There are numerous observations as to the diminishing effect of antihistamines on the flare and wheal caused by histamine and the inhibition by antihistamines of localized accumulation of intravenously injected dyes, such as trypan blue, referable to intradermal injection of histamine (for refs. cf. Loew, 1947; Fe£nberg et al., 1950). As for the inhibition of capillary permeability by antihistamines, some maintain that this action is limited to the case where such permeability has been increased by histamine (Wells, Morris and Dragstedt, 1946; Netter, 1947; Rigdon, 1949), but <b>no</b> <b>single</b> and decisive <b>conclusion</b> can yet be given. </p...|$|R
40|$|Much {{discussion}} in the literature concerning Zenker's diverticulum is related to etiology. Various theories have been propounded, but <b>no</b> <b>single</b> <b>conclusion</b> is generally accepted. We believe that an anatomic predisposition plays a prominent role. Considerations for this conclusion will be discussed. In the otorhinolaryngology departments of University Hospital and Martini Hospital (Groningen, the Netherlands) 545 patients with a diverticulum were treated endoscopically since 1964. Initially we used the procedure described by Dohlman. With {{the increase in the}} number of patients, the technique and instruments used have improved. In 1981 we started to apply a microendoscopic procedure with a special double-lipped scope and the carbon dioxide laser. The rate of complications was very low, and 91 % of the patients are highly satisfied. In view of our results, we feel justified in maintaining that endoscopic treatment is a relatively safe and effective method...|$|E
40|$|This thesis pivots {{around the}} fulcrum of surgical, {{educational}} and technological factors. Whilst there is <b>no</b> <b>single</b> <b>conclusion</b> drawn, it is a multidisciplinary thesis exploring {{the juxtaposition of}} different academic domains that have a significant influence upon each other. The relationship centres on the engineering and computer science factors in learning technologies for surgery. Following a brief introduction to previous efforts developing surgical simulation, this thesis considers education and learning in orthopaedics, the design and building of a simulator for shoulder surgery. The thesis considers the assessment of such tools and embedding into a virtual learning environment. It explains how the performed experiments clarified issues and their actual significance. This leads to discussion {{of the work and}} conclusions are drawn regarding the progress of integration of distributed simulation within the healthcare environment, suggesting how future work can proceed.

40|$|It {{is often}} argued that what marks the {{difference}} between Keynesian macroeconomics and new classical macroeconomics (the first installment of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models) {{is the presence of}} microfoundations. These are deemed to be absent in the Keynesian approach, but central to the new classical one. The aim of my paper is to critically discuss this view. Lucas and Sargent defined the microfoundations requirement as consisting of two elements, optimizing behavior and market clearing. I claim that an alternative, weaker, definition is conceivable, which {{can be traced back to}} Hayek and Patinkin. According to them, the microfoundations requirement consists of a single criterion, optimizing planning. This definition, I claim, is better than the new classical one. Next, I examine whether Keynesian macroeconomics, which admittedly does not abide by the Lucas-Sargent definition, does accord with the Hayek-Patinkin approach. My conclusion is that Keynes’s General Theory is indeed microfounded in this sense, although <b>no</b> <b>single</b> <b>conclusion</b> can be drawn for Keynesian models in general. microfoundations, Keynes, new classical macroeconomics...|$|E
40|$|Mrs. Taverski (all names {{used are}} pseud-onyms) had used Sustained Silent Reading or SSR with her third-grade {{students}} as {{a regular part of}} a daily reading instructional routine for many years. She and other teachers at Green Valley Elementary School firmly believed that stu-dents need daily reading practice to become suc-cessful, motivated readers. The school principal, Mrs. Clapton, informed teachers that because the National Reading Panel (NRP; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [NICHD], 2000) had not found suffi-cient evidence to support the continued use of SSR, teachers were to stop using SSR and instead have stu-dents practice reading by using guided oral repeated readings with feedback. Mrs. Taverski complied with the instructions she was given by her school prin-cipal but harbored concerns about when and how her students would be helped to convert their oral reading skills to silent reading, especially in the third grade where many of her students were more than ready to read silently rather than orally. Mrs. Taverski and other concerned colleagues in-formally spoke with a university literacy researcher and teacher educator they knew well and trusted. Together the group began a journey that led to a redesign of traditionally implemented SSR called Scaffolded Silent Reading (ScSR). Perhaps <b>no</b> other <b>single</b> <b>conclusion</b> drawn by the NRP (NICHD, 2000) has sparked more controversy than the lack of research support for time spent read-ing and the related, prevalent classroom practic...|$|R
40|$|Objective : In hospital, deep vein {{thrombosis}} (DVT) increases the morbidity and mortality in patients with acute medical illness. DVT prophylaxis is well known {{to be effective in}} preventing venous thromoembolism (VTE). However, its use remains suboptimal. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of quality improvement project on adherence with VTE prophylaxis guidelines and on the incidence of hospital-acquired VTEs in medical patients. Methods : The study was conducted at Saudi Aramco Medical Services Organization from June 2008 to August 2009. Quality improvement strategies included education of physicians, the development of a protocol, and weekly monitoring of compliance with the recommendations for VTE prophylaxis as included in the multidisciplinary rounds. A feedback was provided whenever a deviation from the protocol occurs. Results : During the study period, a total of 560 general internal medicine patients met the criteria for VTE prophylaxis. Of those, 513 (91 &#x 0025;) patients actually received the recommended VTE prophylaxis. The weekly compliance rate in the initial stage of the intervention was 63 &#x 0025; (14 of 22) and increased to an overall rate of 100 &#x 0025; (39 of 39) (P = 0. 002). Hospital-acquired DVT rate was 0. 8 per 1000 discharges in the preintervention period and 0. 5 per 1000 discharges in the postintervention period, P = 0. 51. However, there was a significant increase in the time-free period of the VTE and we had 11 months with <b>no</b> <b>single</b> DVT. <b>Conclusion</b> : In this study, the use of multiple interventions increased VTE prophylaxis compliance rate...|$|R

40|$|In {{speaking}} of Islamic studies, {{we need to}} remember two things. First is the approach by which we elaborate certain point from certain perspective. In Islamic studies—like in any other studies—approaches vary. Different approaches would bring different conclusions. However, as long as an approach is academically sound and acceptable and meets all standards required, any conclusion resulted thereon is deemed correct and justifiable. Hence, <b>no</b> <b>single</b> <b>conclusion</b> is considered right while the other is wrong. Islamic studies should therefore acknowledge that academic truth is not singular but plural on the ground that there are many approaches toward many conclusions. It is this notion that we want to discuss here. We are interested in exploring the notion of intellectual truth. We hold that differences in opinion should be accepted as natural. Second is, that there is no fundamental differences in the basic value of sciences of any kinds. In other words, what is popularly known as Western science and Islamic science does not in principle differ. Science is science. There cannot be a dichotomy between Islamic or non-Islamic science. Dichotomy in science is not acceptable. Science belongs to all culture, tradition and religion. It does not know particularity. It is universal. Islamic studies should understand this, and use all tools, approaches, methodologies—albeit Western—for their improvement. It is toward these issues that this paper is destined...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNormal {{functioning}} {{of the immune system}} is crucial to the health of man, and diet {{is one of the major}} exogenous factors modulating individual immunocompetence. Recently, nutrition research has focused on the role of foods or specific food components in enhancing immune system responsiveness to challenges and thereby improving health and reducing disease risks. Assessing diet-induced changes of immune function, however, requires a thorough methodological approach targeting a large spectrum of immune system parameters. Currently, <b>no</b> <b>single</b> marker is available to predict the outcome of a dietary intervention on the resistance to infection or to other immune system-related diseases. The present review summarises the immune function assays commonly used as markers in human intervention studies and evaluates their biological relevance (e. g. known correlation with clinically relevant endpoints), sensitivity (e. g. within- and between-subject variation), and practical feasibility. Based on these criteria markers were classified into three categories with high, medium or low suitability. Vaccine-specific serum antibody production, delayed-type hypersensitivity response, vaccine-specific or total secretory IgA in saliva and the response to attenuated pathogens, were classified as markers with high suitability. Markers with medium suitability include natural killer cell cytotoxicity, oxidative burst of phagocytes, lymphocyte proliferation and the cytokine pattern produced by activated immune cells. Since <b>no</b> <b>single</b> marker allows <b>conclusions</b> to be drawn about the modulation of the whole immune system, except for the clinical outcome of infection itself, combining markers with high and medium suitability is currently the best approach to measure immunomodulation in human nutrition intervention studies. It would be valuable to include several immune markers in addition to clinical outcome in future clinical trials in this area, as there is too little evidence that correlates markers with global health improvement...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A common {{misconception}} among logicians is {{to think}} that intuitionism is necessarily tied-up with <b>single</b> <b>conclusion</b> (sequent or Natural Deduction) calculi. <b>Single</b> <b>conclusion</b> calculi {{can be used to}} model intuitionism and they are convenient, but by no means are they necessary. This has been shown by such influential textbook authors as Kleene, Takeuti and Dummett, to cite only three.

Traditionally one insists on restrictions on particular rules: implication right, negation right and universal quantification right are required to be <b>single</b> <b>conclusion</b> rules. In this note we show that instead of a cardinality restriction such as one-conclusiononly, we can use a notion of dependency between formulae to enforce the constructive character of derivations. The system we obtain, called FIL for full intuitionistic logic, satisfies basic properties such as soundness, completeness and cut elimination. We present two motivating applications of FIL and discuss some future work. Key-words: Intuitionistic Logic. Multiple-conclusion systems. Dependency relations...|$|R
