40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the {{following}} questions: (1) do impending natural disasters affect the equity prices of publicly traded firms that underwrite property & <b>casualty</b> insurance and/or <b>reinsurance?</b> (2) if so, how might this source of risk retard {{the flow of}} capital to firms who write insurance policies?

40|$|The {{puzzle of}} {{underwriting}} cycles and insurance crises in property-liability insurance {{has led to}} numerous economic hypotheses and analyses, yet no single theory seems capable of explaining all of its aspects. Reinsurance is hypothesized to be a potential factor in observed cycles in the primary market; despite this, few underwriting cycle studies focus on reinsurance. The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate determinants of reinsurance prices in the U. S. Nonproportional reinsurance is highlighted, since it is designed to cover the tail of the loss distribution and is considered to be relatively riskier than proportional reinsurance as a result. Separate samples of professional U. S. reinsurers for property and for casualty are studied, based upon the reinsurers' writings of property versus <b>casualty</b> nonproportional <b>reinsurance.</b> The sample period is 1991 - 1995. The results support both the capacity constraint hypothesis and the risky debt hypothesis, {{and this is the first}} research to support both. A major innovation in this study is the use of capacity variables that are broken down by major region of the world. Copyright The Journal of Risk and Insurance. ...|$|R
40|$|Frequent and {{extremely}} damaging severe weather {{conditions in the}} United States during 1991 – 94 caused $ 40 billion in insured losses, creating major impacts and eliciting diverse responses in the weather insurance industry. Population, {{one reason for the}} growing national sensitivity to storm damage, explained much of {{the increase in the number}} of catastrophes (property losses> $ 10 million) as well as the increases in the amount of losses. The largest increases in storms occurred in areas experiencing the greatest population growth (west, southwest, south, and southeast). Shifts in atmospheric variables (particularly in the frequency of extratropical cyclones) explained most of the 1949 – 94 fluctuations found in the intensity of catastrophic storms (losses divided by storm frequency). The property-casualty sector raised rates, made major changes in insurance availability in high-risk areas, tightened underwriting restrictions in hurricane-prone areas, and is making extensive assessments of weather risks. The reinsurance industry raised rates up to 200 %, sought and received funds from the financial markets, and developed new firms. However, some existing firms also withdrew from the marketplace. Crop losses led to major changes in the nation’s crop insurance program. The property <b>casualty</b> and <b>reinsurance</b> sectors, which experienced the greatest losses, have gained a greater appreciation of the need to incorporate atmospheric data, information, and expertise into their operations. Assessment of the problems created by recent weather extremes and possible solutions identified ways that the atmospheric sciences communit...|$|R
