In addition to the <b>national</b> <b>rules</b> she was built {{according to the latest}} international regulations and conventions at the time, becoming the first ship built according to the Code of Safety for Nuclear Merchant Ships adopted by the International Maritime Organization in 1981. Special attention was paid to the safety aspects of the vessel and, in addition to running aground or colliding with the reinforced bow of an icebreaker, the Soviet naval architects even took into account the possibility of a passenger aircraft crashing on Sevmorput.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an ecological}} Europeanization framework {{that provides the}} opportunity to determine the actual size of European and <b>national</b> <b>rule</b> stocks as objective measures of potential sources of external red tape drivers. We illustrate our ecological framework with the case of Dutch competition law for the period running from 1962 to 2010. Applying our framework, we infer the share of European rules in the entire <b>national</b> <b>rule</b> population, thus revealing {{what part of the}} <b>national</b> <b>rule</b> stock is Europeanized. We find that all rule stocks in our sample have increased drastically over time. Moreover, European rules have different effects at the <b>national</b> <b>rule</b> stock level, depending on rule type. European rules serve as weak substitutes for Dutch formal laws, and as complements for Dutch secondary rules. We discuss how the ecological method of measuring external law evolution may inform future organizational red tape research specifically, and studies into formalization generally...|$|R

40|$|The {{interfaces}} between {{national and}} international law have significantly evolved due to subject-matter overlap between {{national and international}} law. The restriction of governmental authority by the ‘rule of law’ is no exception in this regard. International scholarship has so far largely examined the national reception of the international rule of law. Much less recognised is the international perspective: namely, {{as to how the}} international rule of law understands, accepts, or resists the <b>national</b> <b>rule</b> of law. This paper examines the international reception of <b>national</b> <b>rule</b> of law practices within a specific regulatory context of UN targeted sanctions. Member states’ exercise of authority and the UN Security Council’s listing decisions bear resemblance to each other, which creates the conditions for the interfaces between the <b>national</b> and international <b>rule</b> of law. A series of judicial contestations formally based on the <b>national</b> <b>rule</b> of law were translated into normative, theoretical, and political forces at the international level, leading to the generation and materialisation of the principles of fairness and transparency as one of the elements of the international rule of law...|$|R
25|$|The {{first major}} show jumping {{competition}} held in England was at Olympia in 1907. Most of the competitors {{were members of}} the military and it became clear at this competition and in the subsequent years, that there was no uniformity of rules for the sport. Judges marked on their own opinions. Some marked according to the severity of the obstacle and others marked according to style. Before 1907 there were no penalties for a refusal and the competitor was sometimes asked to miss the fence to please the spectators. The first courses were built with little imagination, many consisting of only a straight bar fence and a water jump. A meeting was arranged in 1923 which {{led to the formation of}} the BSJA in 1925. In the United States, a similar need for <b>national</b> <b>rules</b> for jumping and other equestrian activities led to the formation of the American Horse Shows Association in 1917, which now is known as the United States Equestrian Federation.|$|E

[...] Epsilon Kappa was the 100th colony of the sorority. [...] The sorority initially met {{in a wide variety}} of locations, including the basement of the college president's house. [...] In 1984, the sorority moved into Brewster Hall, a College-owned house that had previously been used as an International House and later as temporary housing for the Alpha Chi Omega sorority. [...] In 1992, the sisters of the Epsilon Kappa chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta found the strict <b>national</b> <b>rules</b> and the primarily Christian religious readings and rituals of the organization to be antithetical to the spirit of feminism and inclusivity that the chapter desired. [...] The national organization was unhappy with the colony's decision to disobey their rules and their failure to follow the sorority's rituals. [...] On May 4, 1992, the Dartmouth chapter notified the Kappa Alpha Theta national organization of its unanimous vote to disaffiliate and become a local sorority. [...] The national organization revoked the charter of Epsilon Kappa. The Dartmouth women chose the new name Epsilon Kappa Theta. [...] The current Epsilon Kappa Theta residence is a Victorian house over 100 years old.|$|E

40|$|Interest in {{establishing}} nationally uniform certification, labeling, and management standards for organic products {{grew out of}} concern {{that the existence of}} multiple standards led to consumer and supply chain confusion about, and lack of confidence in, these products. The National Organic Program Final Rule, issued in December 2000, is the result of this interest. We analyze the certification system that was in place prior to the new <b>national</b> <b>rule</b> to evaluate the extent of differences between certification standards and how the <b>national</b> <b>rule</b> is likely to impact the market for organic products. Our analysis suggests that most differences among US certification standards were minor. Also, the most important impacts of the national standard may be in facilitating trade in ingredients and products certified by different certifiers, increasing buyer confidence, and facilitating exports. However, the <b>national</b> <b>rule</b> may decrease the ability of organic certifiers and consumers to place differing emphasis on the multiple goals of organic production and may decrease the flexibility of organic standards to respond to changing market conditions, including new technologies. organic agriculture, organic certification standards, organic labeling, organic market, Agribusiness, Marketing,...|$|R
2500|$|Up {{until the}} early 19th century, {{international}} trade was generally very small in comparison with national output, and was often heavily regulated. In the Middle Ages, European trade was typically regulated at municipal level {{in the interests of}} security for local industry and for established merchants.

2500|$|Kyiv (...) is the romanized {{version of}} the name of the city used in modern Ukrainian. Following {{independence}} in 1991, the Ukrainian government introduced the <b>national</b> <b>rules</b> for transliteration of geographic names from Ukrainian into English. According to the rules, the Ukrainian Київ transliterates into Kyiv. This has established the use of the spelling Kyiv in all official documents issued by the governmental authorities since October 1995. The spelling is used by the United Nations, all English-speaking foreign diplomatic missions, several international organizations, Encarta encyclopedia, and by some media in Ukraine. In October 2006, the United States federal government changed its official spelling of the city name to Kyiv, upon the recommendation of the US Board of Geographic Names. The British government has also started using Kyiv. The alternate romanizations Kyyiv (BGN/PCGN transliteration) and Kyjiv (scholarly) are also in use in English-language atlases. Most major English-language news sources like the BBC, The Economist, and the New York Times continue to prefer Kiev.|$|E
2500|$|While most {{college admissions}} {{involves}} {{high school students}} applying to colleges, transfer admissions are important as well. Estimates {{of the percentage of}} college students who transfer vary from 20% to 33% to 60%, with the consensus position being around a third of college students transfer, and there are many indications that transfer activity is increasing. One report suggested that nearly half of all undergraduates in the nation were attending community colleges. Media coverage of student transfers is generally less than coverage of the high school to college transition. A common transfer path is students moving from two-year community colleges to four-year institutions, although there is considerable movement between four-year institutions. Reasons for transferring include unhappiness with campus life, cost, and course and degree selection. There are no consistent <b>national</b> <b>rules</b> for transfers, and requirements vary by college. Many community colleges have articulation agreements with four-year schools, particularly flagship state universities, so that matters such as the transfers of credits are handled appropriately. There are indications that many private colleges are more actively seeking transfer applicants. Still, transferring can be difficult; transfer students have been described in the past as [...] "academic nomads".|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to <b>national</b> <b>rules,</b> under the European Company Statute, businesses that reincorporate as a Societas Europaea may opt {{to follow the}} Directive for employee involvement. An SE may have a two-tiered board, as in German companies, where shareholders and employees elect a supervisory board that in turn appoints a management board responsible for day-to-day running of the company. Or an SE can have a one tiered board, as every UK company, and employees and shareholders may elect board members in the desired proportion. An [...] "SE" [...] can have no fewer employee participation rights than what existed before, but for a UK company, there {{is likely to have}} been no participation in any case. In the 1977 Report of the committee of inquiry on industrial democracy the Government proposed, in line with the new German Codetermination Act 1976, and mirroring an EU Draft Fifth Company Law Directive, that the board of directors should have an equal number of representatives elected by employees as there were for shareholders. But reform stalled, and was abandoned after the 1979 election. Despite successful businesses like the John Lewis Partnership and Waitrose that are wholly managed and owned by the workforce, voluntary granting of participation is rare. Many businesses run employee share schemes, particularly for highly paid employees; however, such shares seldom compose more than a small percentage of capital in the company, and these investments entail heavy risks for workers, given the lack of diversification.|$|E
