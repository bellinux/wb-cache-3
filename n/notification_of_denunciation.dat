5000|$|There was {{the danger}} <b>of</b> <b>denunciation.</b> The Constitutio Carolina did not plan for denunciation. The legal option of a citizen to open legal {{proceedings}} was through an accusation. This accuser {{had to answer}} for the truth of their accusations. In the case of innocence of the defendant the accuser would be punished. The other way to begin the proceedings was by the personal knowledge of the authorities. This degenerated into a system <b>of</b> <b>denunciation.</b> In some regions during witch trials a box <b>of</b> <b>denunciation</b> (a box hanging or standing at a public place), was used to enable everyone to make anonymous accusations by inserting {{a piece of paper}} without revealing their names, and thus assuming no risk.|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{illuminates}} {{the degree of}} psychological stress response experienced by spouses of cancer patients when given bad news at three different times (<b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name <b>of</b> the disease, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality) {{as well as the}} factors that influence the response and the health status of the spouse as measured by health-related quality of life (QOL). Methods: A total of 203 individuals (57 men and 146 women) who had received the three types of news were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire on psychological stress response, marital satisfaction, and health-related QOL scales. Results: The degree of the psychological stress response was the highest for <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, followed by <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name of the disease, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence. The influencing factors varied depending on the notification period. Although no significant difference was observed for health-related QOL among the three notification types, significant differences were observed for certain items when compared with national standard values. Conclusions: When a <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, which produced the highest psychological stress response, is given, providing care that considers health-related QOL is necessary not only for patients but also for their spouses...|$|R
