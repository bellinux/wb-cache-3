40|$|We microscopically analyze thermal spin pumping {{mediated}} by magnons, at {{the interface between}} a ferromagnetic insulator and a <b>non-magnetic</b> <b>metal,</b> in the semiclassical regime. The generation of a spin current is discussed by calculating the thermal spin transfer torque, which breaks the spin conservation law for conduction electrons and operates the coherent magnon state. Inhomogeneous thermal fluctuations between conduction electrons and magnons induce a net spin current, which is pumped into the adjacent <b>non-magnetic</b> <b>metal.</b> The pumped spin current {{is proportional to the}} temperature difference. When the effective temperature of magnons is lower than that of conduction electrons, localized spins lose spin angular momentum by emitting magnons and conduction electrons flip from down to up by absorbing all the emitted momentum, and vice versa.
