40|$|Many {{malignant}} epithelial tumors show increased {{expression of}} glucose transporter- 1 (GLUT- 1) and hexokinase II (HK-II), {{both of which}} are involved in glucose metabolism. GLUT- 1 levels are often correlated with prognosis in these tumors. The current retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the importance of GLUT- 1 and HK-II expression in leiomyosarcoma (LMS), a malignant uterine <b>non-epithelial</b> <b>tumor</b> with a poor prognosis. The subjects were 23 patients with stage I LMS. Expression of GLUT- 1 and HK-II was evaluated immunohistochemically in samples removed surgically, and the MIB- 1 index was evaluated as a measure of cell proliferation. The association of these results with prognosis was examined. Twenty samples of leiomyoma (LOM), a benign <b>non-epithelial</b> <b>tumor,</b> were used as controls. Immunohistochemical expression was defined as negative staining (–), weak to sporadic staining (1 +), and strong staining (2 +) per microscopic field, respectively. Malignancy was evaluated in 2000 cells and the MIB- 1 index was calculated. Overall survival for LMS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Of the LMS cases, 12 were GLUT- 1 -positive (52. 2 %; 2 +: 2, 1 +: 10) and 15 were HK-II-positive (65. 2 %; 2 +: 1, 1 +: 14). GLUT- 1 expression in LMS was significantly correlated with the MIB 1 index. The 10 -year survival rates were 90. 9 % and 58. 3 % in GLUT- 1 -negative and GLUT- 1 -positive cases, respectively, and 75. 0 % and 73. 3 % in HK-II-positive and HK-II-negative cases, respectively. GLUT- 1 expression was significantly correlated with prognosis. Cases of stage I LMS showed a significant correlation between the expression level of GLUT- 1 and the MIB- 1 index, an indicator of malignancy. GLUT- 1 -negative cases had a better prognosis than GLUT- 1 -positive cases, suggesting that GLUT- 1 expression is an effective prognostic marker...|$|E

In the present study, we describe the development, validation, and transfer across laboratories of a new antibody-independent device for the enrichment of CTCs from blood samples of patients with various cancer diagnoses. The ApoStream® device uses dielectrophoresis (DEP) field-flow assist to separate non-hematopoietic cells from the peripheral blood mononuclear fraction by exposing cells in a laminar flow stream to a critical alternating current frequency. The ApoStream® device was calibrated and validated in a formal cross-laboratory protocol using 3 different cancer cell lines spanning a range of distinct phenotypes (A 549, MDA-MB- 231, and ASPS- 1). In spike-recovery experiments, cancer cell recovery efficiencies appeared independent of spiking level and averaged between 68 % and 55 %, depending on the cell line. No inter-run carryover was detected in control samples. Moreover, the clinical-readiness of the device {{in the context of}} non-epithelial cancers was evaluated with blood specimens from fifteen patients with metastatic sarcoma.

40|$|Abstract Background 14 - 3 - 3 σ is a p 53 -mediated cell-cycle {{inhibitor}} in epithelial cells. The {{expression of}} 14 - 3 - 3 σ is frequently altered in cancers of epithelial origin associated with altered DNA methylation. Since its {{involvement in a}} <b>non-epithelial</b> <b>tumor</b> is unknown, we examined 14 - 3 - 3 σ expression in patients with haematological malignancies. Methods We analyzed 41 hematopoietic cell lines and 129 patients {{with a variety of}} hematological malignancies for 14 - 3 - 3 σ expression with real-time RT-PCR. We also examined protein levels by Western blot analysis and DNA methylation status of the 14 - 3 - 3 σ gene by methylation-specific PCR analysis of bisulfite-treated DNA. In addition, mutations of p 53 gene were identified by RT-PCR-SSCP analysis and the expression levels of 14 - 3 - 3 σ were compared with those of other cell-cycle inhibitor genes, CDKN 2 A and ARF. Results The expression levels of 14 - 3 - 3 σ mRNA in almost all cell lines were low and comparable to those in normal hematopoietic cells except for 2 B-cell lines. On the contrary, 14 - 3 - 3 σ mRNA was aberrantly overexpressed frequently in mature lymphoid malignancies (30 of 93, 32. 3 %) and rarely in acute leukemia (3 of 35, 8. 6 %). 14 - 3 - 3 σ protein was readily detectable and roughly reflected the mRNA level. In contrast to epithelial tumors, methylation status of the 14 - 3 - 3 σ gene was not associated with expression in hematological malignancies. Mutations of p 53 were identified in 12 patients and associated with lower expression of 14 - 3 - 3 σ. The expression levels of 14 - 3 - 3 σ, CDKN 2 A and ARF were not correlated with but rather reciprocal to one another, suggesting that simultaneous overexpression of any two of them is incompatible with tumor growth. Conclusion 14 - 3 - 3 σ, an epithelial cell marker, was overexpressed significantly in a subset of mature lymphoid malignancies. This is the first report of aberrant 14 - 3 - 3 σ expression in non-epithelial tumors in vivo. Since the significance of 14 - 3 - 3 σ overexpression is unknown even in epithelial tumors such as pancreatic cancers, further analysis of regulation and function of the 14 - 3 - 3 σ gene in non-epithelial as well as epithelial tumors is warranted. </p...|$|E
40|$|Seit Anfang der 90 -iger Jahre ist bekannt, dass nichtsteroidale Antirheumatika die Inzidenz des kolorektalen Karzinoms vermindern können. Diese antitumoröse Aktivität wird wahrscheinlich über die Cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) vermittelt, welche die Biosynthese von Prostaglandin H 2, einer Vorstufe der Prostanoide, katalysiert. Eine Überexpression der COX- 2 wurde für verschiedene Karzinome beschreiben. In dieser Studie wurde die Expression und tumorbiologische Relevanz der COX- 2 im malignen Melanom, als Vertreter nichtepithelialer Tumoren, untersucht. Im Western blot wurde COX- 2 Protein in den sechs untersuchten Melanomzelllinien nachgewiesen. Mittels eines spezifischen ELISAs wurde PGE 2 im Überstand der Zelllinien nachgewiesen. Die PGE 2 -Biosynthese wurde durch den COX- 2 -spezifischen Inhibitor NS 398 konzentrationsabhängig inhibiert. Die IC 50 der COX- 2 für NS 398 wurde mit etwa 6 microM bestimmt. NS 398 inhibierte die Matrigelinvasion aller sechs Melanomzelllinien, ohne Einfluss auf die Proliferation zu haben. Die Invasionshemmung war PGE 2 -unabhängig, weil i) exogenes PGE 2 die Invasionshemmung nicht wieder aufhob, ii) die erforderliche Konzentration von NS 398 zur Invasionshemmung im 8 -fachen Bereich der IC 50 der COX- 2 lag. Die COX- 2 ist Melanomzellen konstitutiv exprimiert und synthetisiert PGE 2. NS 398 hemmt die Invasion von Melanomzellen in PGE 2 -unabhängiger Weise und könnte somit über ein sog. Non-COX-target wirken. Accumulating {{evidence}} indicates that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can {{reduce the incidence of}} colorectal cancers in humans. This antineoplastic activity is largely related to the inhibition of the inducible cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2), which catalizes the biosynthesis of prostaglandin H 2 the precursor of prostanoids. Elevated expression of COX- 2 has been described in several types of epithelial tumors. In this study we evaluate the expression and function of COX- 2 in malignant melanoma as a model of a <b>non-epithelial</b> <b>tumor.</b> With Western blot COX- 2 protein was detected in all of six malignant melanoma cell lines. These cell lines produced prostaglandinE 2 (PGE 2) which was measured by a specific ELISA. PGE 2 biosynthesis was blocked in a concentration dependent manner by the COX- 2 -specific inhibitor NS 398. The COX- 2 IC 50 for NS 398 was determined with 6 microM. In all six cell lines treatment with NS 398 reduced the invasion through a matrigel coated membrane while cell proliferation was not influenced. The inhibition of invasion was not mediated by PGE 2, because i) exogenous PGE 2 did not restore invasion, ii) the concentration needed for inhibitory effects on invasion was 8 -fold higher than the IC 50 of the COX- 2. COX- 2 is constitively expressed in malignant melanoma cells and is capable to produce PGE 2. NS 398 reduces melanoma cell invsaion in a PGE 2 -independent manner, thus it likely further acts via a non-COX-target...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Most {{deaths from}} ovarian cancer {{are due to}} metastases that are {{resistant}} to conventional therapies. But the factors that regulate the metastatic process and chemoresistance of ovarian cancer are poorly understood. In the current study, we investigated the aberrant expression of human sperm protein 17 (HSp 17) in human epithelial ovarian cancer cells and tried to analyze its influences on the cell behaviors like migration and chemoresistance. Methods Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry were used to identify HSp 17 in paraffin embedded ovarian malignant tumor specimens and peritoneal metastatic malignant cells. Then we examined the effect of HSp 17 overexpression on the proliferation, migration, and chemoresistance of ovarian cancer cells to carboplatin and cisplatin in a human ovarian carcinoma cell line, HO 8910. Results We found that HSp 17 was aberrantly expressed in 43 % (30 / 70) of the patients with primary epithelial ovarian carcinomas, and {{in all of the}} metastatic cancer cells of ascites from 8 patients. The Sp 17 expression was also detected in the metastatic lesions the same as in ovarian lesions. None of the 7 <b>non-epithelial</b> <b>tumors</b> primarily developed in the ovaries was immunopositive for HSp 17. Overexpression of HSp 17 increased the migration but decreased the chemosensitivity of ovarian carcinoma cells to carboplatin and cisplatin. Conclusion HSp 17 is aberrantly expressed in a significant proportion of epithelial ovarian carcinomas. Our results strongly suggest that HSp 17 plays a role in metastatic disease and resistance of epithelial ovarian carcinoma to chemotherapy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (IBD) are {{at increased}} risk of colorectal malignancies. Adenocarcinoma is the commonest type of colorectal neoplasm associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease, but other types of epithelial and <b>non-epithelial</b> <b>tumors</b> have also been described in inflamed bowel. With regards to non-epithelial malignancies, lymphomas and sarcomas represent the largest group of tumors reported in association with IBD, especially in immunosuppressed patients. Carcinoids and in particular neuroendocrine neoplasms other than carcinoids (NENs) are rare tumors and are infrequently described in the setting of IBD. Thus, this association requires further investigation. We report two cases of neoplasms arising in mild left-sided UC with immunohistochemical staining for neuroendocrine markers: a large cell and a small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the rectum. The two patients were different in age (35 years vs 77 years) and disease duration (11 years vs 27 years), and both had never received immunosuppressant drugs. Although the patients underwent regular endoscopic and histological follow-up, the two neoplasms were locally advanced at diagnosis. One of the two patients developed multiple liver metastases and died 15 mo after diagnosis. These findings confirm the aggressiveness and the poor prognosis of NENs compared to colorectal adenocarcinoma. While carcinoids seem to be coincidentally associated with IBD, NENs may also arise in this setting. In fact, long-standing inflammation could be directly responsible for the development of pancellular dysplasia involving epithelial, goblet, Paneth and neuroendocrine cells. It has yet to be established which IBD patients have a higher risk of developing NENs...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{ascertain}} the cytological diagnosis of metastatic lesions with special {{reference to the}} clinicopathological analysis of the primary site in cases of epithelial and <b>non-epithelial</b> <b>tumors.</b> Materials and Methods: One hundred seventy-one suspected metastatic lesions were aspirated with a 22 - 23 G needle and the smears were fixed and stained. The {{cases in which the}} primary site was not evident at the time of initial presentation were subsequently subjected to thorough physical examination followed by radiological investigations for the search of the primary site. Histopathological examination was performed in 16 cases with inconclusive cytological impression. Observations: Of the total cases of metastatic lesions, 155 cases (90. 6 %) were diagnosed by fine needle aspiration biopsy and 16 cases (9. 4 %) by histopathology. The majority of the cases, 81 (47. 4 %), were observed in the fifth decade of life, followed by 76 cases (44. 4 %) in the sixth decade and 11 cases (6. 4 %) in the seventh decade of life. Lymph nodes were the most frequent site of metastasis in 115 cases (67. 3 %), with the majority in the cervical group. The oropharynx, including the oral cavity and pharyngolarynx, was observed to be the most common primary site, 55 cases (32. 2 %). Conclusion: The most critical aspect of the evaluation of metastatic cases is the accurate pathologic assessment of the malignant tissues in conjunction with pertinent clinical data. Such close collaboration between the clinician and the pathologist may maximize the diagnostic potential in treatable primary tumors...|$|R
30|$|Uterine sarcoma is a <b>non-epithelial</b> {{malignant}} <b>tumor</b> {{that occurs}} in the uterus. It is resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The prognosis is extremely poor, except in cases in which early radical resection is possible (Gadducci et al. 2008). As the mass grows from the myometrium, approaching it from outside the body and making a pathological diagnosis from a biopsy can be difficult. Thus, the early diagnosis of uterine sarcoma often requires a hysterectomy and a pathological search. Preoperative diagnosis for uterine sarcoma using imaging and hematological findings has not exhibited a high accuracy. Therefore, many patients who undergo hysterectomy on a suspicion of uterine sarcoma are finally diagnosed with benign uterine myoma, the most common uterine mass. Only few patients are diagnosed with uterine sarcoma.|$|R
