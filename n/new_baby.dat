5|$|Edward's {{name was}} English in origin, linking {{him to the}} Anglo-Saxon saint Edward the Confessor, and was chosen by his father instead of the more {{traditional}} Norman and Castilian names selected for Edward's brothers: Edward had three elder brothers: John and Henry who had died before Edward was born, and Alphonso, who died in August 1284, leaving Edward as {{the heir to the}} throne. Although Edward was a relatively healthy child, there were enduring concerns throughout his early years that he too might die and leave his father without a male heir. After his birth, Edward was looked after by a wet-nurse called Mariota or Mary Maunsel for a few months until she fell ill, when Alice de Leygrave became his foster mother. He would have barely known his natural mother Eleanor, who was in Gascony with his father during his earliest years. An official household complete with staff was created for the <b>new</b> <b>baby,</b> under the direction of a clerk, Giles of Oudenarde.|$|E
5|$|Season two {{begins with}} Coach Taylor {{living and working}} in Austin as an {{assistant}} coach at fictional TMU, while wife Tami remains in Dillon with daughter Julie and newborn baby Gracie. Tami is struggling with the demands of the <b>new</b> <b>baby</b> and Julie's rebellious behavior. The Panthers' new coach, Bill McGregor, creates friction between Smash and Matt by showing blatant favoritism to Smash, drives Tim so hard he passes out during practice from dehydration and is hospitalized, alienates assistant coach Jason Street by his condescending manner, and alienates Boosters president Buddy Garrity by barring him from team practices. When Smash and Matt actually come to blows on the field and a crucial game is won by Smash, Buddy engineers the firing of the new coach and persuades Taylor that both the team and his family are suffering in his absence. Taylor agrees to return.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) and her husband, {{state senator}} Robert (Jack Coleman), welcome their <b>new</b> <b>baby,</b> also named Phillip. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Gabe all visit Angela at the hospital. According to Angela, {{the baby was}} born prematurely, but due to the size, Oscar deduces that Angela lied about the date of conception. Angela admits that the baby was {{conceived}} a month before her wedding, and makes them promise not to tell anyone. Suspecting that Dwight is the real father, Oscar breaks his promise and tells him when he arrives at the hospital in search of Gabe. Dwight barges in on Angela and her husband and begins thoroughly examining the child. When the senator leaves, Dwight confronts Angela about the child, claiming that it is his. She refutes his claim, but Dwight leaves satisfied, telling the attending nurse to call off the baby's circumcision, which the nonplussed nurse refuses to do. Upon returning to Dunder Mifflin he drops his dispute with Jim, since his self-assumed fatherhood has given him a new appreciation for the duties of parenthood. The episode ends with Dwight putting a decal on his car, in honor of his covert new family member.|$|E
