The victim was a white investment banker allegedly gang raped and brutalized by black and Latino teens, during an era of increasing juvenile lawlessness. The convictions of the youths, aged 14 - 16 {{at the time of}} the offense, relied on video-taped “confessions, ” which they subsequently challenged on appeal. [1] The appeals raised numerous questions about the confession evidence as well as other issues, though none were successful. More recently, <b>newly-discovered</b> <b>evidence</b> prompted motions for post-conviction relief, focusing on the question whether the new evidence would have resulted in a more favorable verdict for the defendants. Matias Reyes, a convicted murdererrapist, came forward and reported he alone attacked and sexually assaulted the victim. Reyes provided DNA samples that matched evidence found at the crime scene. The decision to throw out the convictions was virtually assured when the Manhattan District Attorney released its December 5, 2002, report [2] noting the “serious weaknesses ” of the teens ’ confessions when compared with the DNA and other evidence linking Matias to the offense. In addition to the DNA match linking Reyes to the crime, the DA’s report outlined how the vicious assault had multiple signature elements common to other sexual assaults known to have been perpetrated by Reyes in the same vicinity during the same time period. The legal turn of events in the Central Park Jogger case occurred in a climate of increasing concern about juvenile “false confessions. ” A 1998 California case involving a 14 year old who “confessed ” to the murder of his sister received widesprea...|$|E
40|$|No one {{favors the}} {{execution}} of an innocent person. That event represents the ultimate failure of the justice system, both {{in the view of}} those who consider the risk of such a failure to be so intolerable as to constitute a reason for abolishing capital punishment altogether and in the view of those who consider it to be an acceptable cost of an otherwise desirable institution. Yet the danger of wrongful execution is chillingly real. Whether one gains insight from scholarly studies current judicial proceedings or by experiencing the intensity of community pressures to convict someone – anyone - of these atrocious crimes, it is difficult to deny that there is a special danger of factual error in capital cases. That danger is exacerbated both by the grisly consequence of such errors and by the general tendency of evidence of innocence to emerge only at a relatively late stage in capital proceedings. 2 ̆ 2 Yet the states 2 ̆ 7 corrective mechanisms are simply inadequate. Motions to reopen criminal convictions on the grounds of <b>newly-discovered</b> <b>evidence</b> must overcome understandably heavy policies in favor of finality and must meet burdens which require a finding, for example, that the profferred material 2 ̆ 2 would probably have changed the verdict. 2 ̆ 2 These standards, of course, are applied by a judge (normally the original trial judge), not by a jury. This practice deprives the defendant of a jury 2 ̆ 7 s sensitivity to possible weaknesses in the prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s case on the issue of guilt - a sensitivity that is recognized to act as a safeguard against the return not only of a wrongful conviction but also of a death sentence against the possibly innocent. Moreover, once a conviction becomes final, many states will not permit such claims {{in the context of a}} state collateral proceeding - notwithstanding the fact that this is commonly the lengthiest element of the entire capital adjudicatory process, and hence a stage at which new evidence may well emerge...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} broader antecedents of the Communist Party of Albania (CPA) {{as one of}} a number of associations whose experience was central to Albanian political history. This long experience dates back to the informal national associations formed in the Ottoman Empire of the late nineteenth century. The dissertation examines the role of these associations which, pursuing language rights and political representation through imperial state reforms, set a pattern that struggled to connect nation and state, rather than asserting the territorial demands for a nation-state familiar across the region. Starting out in the Ottoman Empire, but then maturing in the Albanian diaspora in Romania, Bulgaria, Egypt and the United States, this dissertation shows politically significant processes of longer-term adaptation that created informal associations as institutional structures able to channel collective action. It then traces the reframing of these patterns through their destruction in the Balkan Wars and the First World War to the emergence of communist associations in the interwar period and beyond. This dissertation is a sustained study that traces long-term Ottoman imperial political legacies in the Albanian successor state. The story of the associations, based on hitherto unexamined archival documents, shows that the Albanians possessed a far greater capacity for political mobilization that previously acknowledged by historians. Moreover, the dissertation successfully challenges the conventional wisdom that portrays the Albanians as irreparably divided along sectarian and regional faultlines. It finds that Albanian national activism was civic in character rather than ethnic as elsewhere in the Balkans. The Albanians fought to remain within a multinational framework because this afforded them political security, social advancement and potential economic growth. In the late Ottoman period, this political objective was manifested in the acceptance of the supranational imperial order whereas during the Second World War, in the aspiration to become members of the Comintern internationalist movement. Another important find, is the <b>newly-discovered</b> <b>evidence</b> concerning the founding of the CPA and its wartime conduct as an organization created and led by the Albanians themselves, albeit with Yugoslav ideological assistance under the transnational umbrella of the Comintern...|$|E
