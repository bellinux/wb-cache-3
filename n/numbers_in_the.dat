Hester was allowed to keep number 23, a number normally used for cornerbacks, since it sits outside the 50-79 range. Along with former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Dwight Stone, who wore number 20 during his eight-year stint in Pittsburgh, Hester was one of two wide receivers to wear a 20's jersey number since the NFL adopted the current uniform numbering system in 1973.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the First World War, the British Army remained {{responsible for the}} exhumation of remains. The Western Front was divided into sectors and combed for bodies by 12-man exhumation units. Between the Armistice and September 1921, the exhumation units reburied 204,695 bodies. After 1921, no further comprehensive search for bodies was undertaken, and in February 1921 responsibility for the cemeteries {{was transferred to the}} Commission. Nevertheless, despite the rigour of the searches, bodies continued to be discovered in large <b>numbers.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> three years {{following the}} conclusion of the general search 38,000bodies were discovered.

5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; the {{birthday}} {{is associated with}} the self, and hence the <b>numbers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> birthday are preferred, {{despite the fact that they}} appear in many other contexts. People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the birthday-number effect. A similar effect, the name-letter effect, has been found for letters: people tend to prefer the letters that are part of their name. The birthday-number effect and the name-letter effect are significantly correlated. In psychological assessments, the Number Preference Task is used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E

5|$|Starfish are in {{some cases}} taken from their habitat and sold to {{tourists}} as souvenirs, ornaments, curios or for display in aquariums.
