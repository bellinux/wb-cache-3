5|$|In 1867, Clark {{became the}} third {{president}} of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (MAC), now the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He {{was the first to}} appoint a faculty and admit a class of students. Although initially successful, MAC was criticized by politicians and <b>newspaper</b> <b>editors</b> who felt it was a waste of funding in a state that was growing increasingly industrial. Farmers of western Massachusetts were slow to support the college. Despite these obstacles, Clark's success in organizing an innovative academic institution earned him international attention.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} war strategy, Lincoln {{articulated}} two priorities: {{to ensure that}} Washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt, decisive victory; major Northern <b>newspaper</b> <b>editors</b> expected victory within 90 days. Twice a week, Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon, and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force {{him to take a}} carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard. Lincoln learned from reading the theoretical book of his chief of staff General Henry Halleck, a disciple of the European strategist Jomini; he began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River. Lincoln saw the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory.|$|E

5|$|The acts became {{controversial}} {{from prosecution}} thereunder of a Congressman {{and a number}} of <b>newspaper</b> <b>editors.</b> Indeed, the Federalist administration initiated fourteen or more indictments under the Sedition Act, as well as suits against five of the six most prominent Democratic–Republican newspapers. The majority of the legal actions began in 1798 and 1799, and went to trial {{on the eve of the}} 1800 presidential election – timing that hardly appeared coincidental, according to biographer Ferling. Other historians have cited evidence that the Alien and Sedition Acts were rarely enforced, namely: 1) only 10 convictions under the Sedition Act have been identified; 2) Adams never signed a deportation order; and 3) the sources of expressed furor over the acts were Democratic–Republicans. However, other historians have emphasized that the Acts were employed for political targeting from the outset, causing many aliens to leave the country. The Acts as well allowed for prosecution of many who opposed the Federalists, even on the floor of Congress. In any case, the election of 1800 in fact became a bitter and volatile contest, with each side expressing extraordinary fear of the other and its policies; after Democratic–Republicans prevailed in the elections of 1800, they used the acts against Federalists before the laws finally expired.|$|E

25|$|In the {{political}} campaign of 1888, the Democrats waged a battle unparalleled in corruption and violence to gain quorum control over {{both houses of}} the legislature.

Hailed by <b>newspaper</b> <b>editors</b> {{as the end of}} black voting, the laws worked as expected, and African American voting declined precipitously in rural and small town Tennessee. Many urban blacks continued to vote until so-called progressive reforms eliminated their political power in the early twentieth century.|$|E
