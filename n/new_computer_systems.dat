The {{minds of}} the {{majority}} of software engineers are not, and most of existing source code is still sequential. Within only a few years, multicore processors changed the system landscape, but the competence to reengineer for computer systems of today is shared among a small community of software engineers. In this paper we present AutoFuture, an approach that automatically identifies parallelizable locations in sequential source code and reengineers them for multicore. This approach demands minimal change to sequential source code. AutoFutures make parallel code easy to understand and increase the acceptance of parallel software. ...|$|E
