If he had been as ill-natured to them as he was to everybody else, he might have beaten down their biggest city at one kick, and hardly have known that he did it.

But, being the son of Mother Earth, as they likewise were, the Giant gave them his brotherly kindness, and loved them with as big a love as it was possible to feel for creatures so very small. And, on their parts, the Pygmies loved Antaeus with as much affection as their tiny hearts could hold. He was always ready to do them any good offices that lay in his power; as for example, when they wanted a breeze to turn their windmills, the Giant would set all the sails a-going with the mere <b>natural</b> <b>respiration</b> <b>of</b> his lungs. When the sun was too hot, he often sat himself down, and let his shadow fall over the kingdom, from one frontier to the other; and as for matters in general, he was wise enough to let them alone, and leave the Pygmies to manage their own affairs--which, after all, is about the best thing that great people can do for little ones.|$|R

Our observations capture the development of a massive phytoplankton bloom and reveal striking variability in pCO₂ and biological oxygen saturation (ΔO₂/Ar) resulting from large shifts in community metabolism on time scales ranging from hours to weeks. Diel oscillations in surface gases are used to derive a high-resolution time series of net community production (NCP) that is consistent with ¹⁴C-based primary productivity estimates and with the observed seasonal evolution of phytoplankton biomass. A combination of physical mixing, grazing, and light availability appears to drive variability in coastal Antarctic NCP, leading to strong shifts between net autotrophy and heterotrophy on various time scales.

Similarly, the REIP calculated from Handyspec showed significant difference between the infested and the control plants before the visual symptoms appeared.

This effect takes place while the chlorophyll of green leaves, or the carotenoid of etiolated leaves, is steadily decreasing. Kinetin, at a concentration which inhibits the decrease in pigment, completely prevents the respiratory rise; instead, the oxygen consumption drifts downwards. Lower kinetin concentrations have a proportional effect, 50 % reduction <b>of</b> <b>respiration</b> being given by about 0. 1 mg/l. About one-fifth of the respiratory rise {{may be attributed to}} the free amino acids which are liberated during senescence; several amino acids are shown to cause increases of almost 50 % in the oxygen consumption when supplied at the concentrations of total amino acid present during senescence. A smaller part of the rise may also be due to soluble sugars liberated during senescence, largely coming from the hydrolysis of a presumptive fructosan. The remainder, and the largest part, of the increase is ascribed to a <b>natural</b> uncoupling <b>of</b> <b>respiration</b> from phosphorylation. This is deduced from the fact that dinitrophenol causes a similar large rise in the oxygen consumption of the fresh leaves or of leaf segments kept green with kinetin, but causes only a very small rise when the oxygen consumption is near its peak in senescent controls. The <b>respiration</b> <b>of</b> these leaves is resistant to cyanide, and 10 mm KCN even increases it by some 30 %; in contrast, etiolated leaves of the same age, which undergo a similar rise in oxygen consumption over the same time period, show normal sensitivity to cyanide.

40|$|AbstractCarbon cycle has a {{fundamental}} role in changing {{climate of the}} earth. Recent models of the estuary-atmosphere system demonstrate the potentially great importance of estuarine environment to the regulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Carbon, the key element of life is available in organic and inorganic forms as different compounds in air, water and soil. Our study site, Hooghly - Matla estuarine system receives a large load of nutrients throughout the year. This is mainly due to high litterfall from the adjacent luxuriant mangroves and yield of huge suspended sediment carried along with the river Ganges which is flowing through {{the western part of the}} Sundarban mangrove ecosystem. Keeping in view the crucial role of carbon, a seven compartment model has been proposed to study the dynamics of carbon in this estuarine system. Different forms of carbon present in soil (as soil organic carbon (SOC), soil inorganic carbon (SIC)) and in water (as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved carbon dioxide (DCO 2), dissolved bicarbonate (DBC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC)) are taken as state variables. Litter biomass, dissolved oxygen, primary productivity, community <b>respiration,</b> temperature <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> pH <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> pH <b>of</b> soil, air-water exchange of carbon dioxide and conversion rates among different forms of carbon are considered as graph time functions.

Model simulation results are validated with observed data. Results show seasonal variations of litterfall and which is the main source of SOC pool and ultimately transported to the estuary. Other than litterfall, death of organisms in soil and water enriches the SOC and POC respectively. pH <b>of</b> <b>water</b> is governing factor and depending on this factor, DIC is converted to DCO 2 and DBC, which are taken up by phytoplankton during photosynthesis.
