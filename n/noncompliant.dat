5|$|The opening {{titles are}} {{accompanied}} by a mock-Elizabethan arrangement of Howard Goodall's Blackadder theme played on a recorder and an electric guitar, and feature a black snake slithering about on a marble table. The snake, <b>noncompliant</b> to the wishes of its handler, is eventually removed and replaced with something related to the episode title, which in this series is always a single noun. The opening ominous string crescendo and imagery are a parody of the opening credits of the 1976 BBC television adaptation of Robert Graves' I, Claudius.|$|E

25|$|MEXICO: Mexico {{was listed}} in the {{previous}} Compliance Report to Congress as <b>noncompliant</b> with its responsibilities under the Convention.

Mexican and U.S. Central Authority officials have met four times to discuss better procedures for dealing with cases, resulting in better and more frequent communication and case updates.

2500|$|A {{process of}} {{indirect}} cost-shifting {{may have led}} to a form of [...] "re-institutionalization" [...] through the increased use of jail detention for those with mental disorders deemed unmanageable and <b>noncompliant.</b> When laws were enacted requiring communities to take more responsibility for mental health care, necessary funding was often absent, and jail became the default option, being cheaper than psychiatric care.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the last}} report, the Department found Mexico to be <b>noncompliant</b> with the Convention due to {{systemic}} problems, including slow case handling, {{lack of progress}} in resolving cases, and inability to locate children. [...] Mexico {{continues to be the}} destination country of the greatest number of children abducted from the United States or wrongfully retained outside the United States by parents or other relatives. [...] Over the recent reporting period, the Department has seen some notable improvements in the performance of the Mexican Central Authority (MCA). [...] The MCA forwards Hague applications to judges much more expeditiously than before; whereas previously delays of 3–6 months were common, cases are now being forwarded to the courts as early as 4–8 weeks after being received. [...] MCA responsiveness to inquiries from the U.S. Central Authority has also improved. [...] The Office of Children’s Issues is now in regular (weekly and at times daily) contact with the MCA. [...] Mexican authorities and judges participated in various training opportunities and judicial conferences co-sponsored by the Department of State. [...] This training appears to be having a positive effect. [...] Over the past year we have seen the highest number of court-ordered returns from Mexico to the United States of any reporting period.|$|E
2500|$|Science-fiction {{poetry is}} poetry {{that has the}} {{characteristics}} or subject matter of science fiction. Science fiction poetry's main sources are the sciences and the literary movement of science fiction prose. An extended discussion of the field is given in Suzette Haden Elgin's The Science Fiction Poetry Handbook, where she compares and contrasts it to both mainstream poetry and to prose science fiction. The former, she maintains, uses figures of speech unencumbered by <b>noncompliant</b> details, whereas these details can be key elements in science-fiction poetry. Prose in science fiction has the time to develop a setting and a story, whereas a poem {{in the field is}} normally constrained by its short length to rely on some device to get a point across quickly. Elgin says that the effectiveness of this kind of poetry pivots around the correct use of presupposition. The Science Fiction Association is an international organization of speculative poets, which gives the annual Rhysling Awards for speculative poetry. An early example of science fiction in poetry is in Alfred, Lord Tennyson's Locksley Hall, where he introduces a picture of the future with [...] "When I dipt into the future far as human eye could see...." [...] This poem was written in 1835, {{near the end of the}} first Industrial Revolution. Poetry was only sparingly published in traditional science-fiction outlets such as pulp magazines until the New Wave. By the 1980s there were magazines specifically devoted to science-fiction poetry.|$|E
2500|$|The CD-R, {{originally}} named CD Write-Once (WO), specification {{was first}} published in 1988 by Philips and Sony in the 'Orange Book'. The Orange Book consists of several parts, furnishing details of the CD-WO, CD-MO (Magneto-Optic), and CD-RW (ReWritable). The latest editions have abandoned {{the use of the term}} [...] "CD-WO" [...] in favor of [...] "CD-R", while [...] "CD-MO" [...] were used very little. [...] Written CD-Rs and CD-RWs are, in the aspect of low-level encoding and data format, fully compatible with the audio CD (Red Book CD-DA) and data CD (Yellow Book CD-ROM) standards. [...] (Note that the Yellow Book standard for CD-ROM only specifies a high-level data format and refers to the Red Book for all physical format and low-level code details, such as track pitch, linear bit density, and bitstream encoding.) [...] This means they use Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation, CIRC error correction, and, for CD-ROM, the third error correction layer defined in the Yellow Book. [...] Properly written CD-R discs on blanks of less than 80 minutes length are fully compatible with the audio CD and CD-ROM standards in all details including physical specifications. [...] 80 minute CD-R discs marginally violate the Red Book physical format specifications, and longer discs are <b>noncompliant.</b> [...] CD-RW discs have lower reflectivity than CD-R or pressed (non-writable) CDs and for this reason cannot meet the Red Book standard (or come close). [...] Some hardware compatible with Red Book CDs may have difficulty reading CD-Rs and, because of their lower reflectivity, especially CD-RWs. [...] To the extent that CD hardware can read extended-length discs or CD-RW discs, it is because that hardware has capability beyond the minimum required by the Red Book and Yellow Book standards (the hardware is more capable than it needs to be to bear the Compact Disc logo).|$|E
