5000|$|Tobaccos {{for smoking}} in pipes are often {{carefully}} treated and blended to achieve flavour nuances {{not available in}} other tobacco products. Many of these are blends using staple ingredients of variously cured Burley and Virginia tobaccos which are enhanced by spice tobaccos, among them many Oriental or Balkan varietals, Latakia (a fire-cured spice tobacco of Syrian origin), Perique (uniquely grown in St. James Parish, Louisiana) which is also an old method of fermentation, or blends of Virginia and Burley tobaccos of African, Indian, or South American origins. Traditionally, many U.S. blends are made of American Burley with sweeteners and flavorings added to create an [...] "aromatic" [...] flavor, whereas [...] "English" [...] blends are based on <b>natural</b> Virginia <b>tobaccos</b> enhanced with Oriental and other <b>natural</b> <b>tobaccos.</b> There is a growing tendency towards [...] "natural" [...] tobaccos which derive their aromas from artful blending with selected spice tobaccos only and careful, often historically-based, curing processes.|$|R

Therefore correlations between nicotine-, tar- and CO-content and filling density were performed. Neither a correlation between nicotine-, tar- and CO-content and PM values nor filling density or tobacco weight and PM emission could be found (r = − 0.04 for all correlations).|$|R
50|$|Santa Fe <b>Natural</b> <b>Tobacco</b> Company {{was founded}} by Bill Drake, who had {{published}} The Cultivator's Handbook of Marijuana, Robert Marion, an acupuncture student at the Kototama Institute in Santa Fe, and Chris Webster, a Santa Fe Realtor.

40|$|We have {{obtained}} precatalytic (enzyme–substrate complex) and postcatalytic (enzyme–product complex) crystal structures {{of an active}} full-length hammerhead RNA that cleaves in the crystal. Using the <b>natural</b> satellite <b>tobacco</b> ringspot virus hammerhead RNA sequence, the self-cleavage reaction was modulated by substituting the general base of the ribozyme, G 12, with A 12, a purine variant with a much lower pK a that does not significantly perturb the ribozyme’s atomic structure. The active, but slowly cleaving, ribozyme thus permitted isolation of enzyme–substrate and enzyme–product complexes without modifying the nucleophile or leaving group of the cleavage reaction, nor any other aspect of the substrate. The predissociation enzyme-product complex structure reveals RNA and metal ion interactions potentially relevant to transition-state stabilization that are absent in precatalytic structures...|$|R
50|$|Unlike most tobaccos, dokha is {{not fire}} cured and cut, but dried in the arid desert region {{from which it}} came. It is finely ground in a timely {{delicate}} manner to preserve {{the content of the}} tobacco, its strength, freshness and flavor. Due to the lesser degree of processing, dokha tobacco appears essentially unaltered. This allows it to maintain the green coloration of the <b>natural</b> plant. The <b>tobacco,</b> is then carefully blended with herbs and spices which creates the complex flavors.|$|R

30|$|It {{is highly}} {{improbable}} that <b>Natural</b> American Spirit <b>tobacco</b> products are a less harmful choice—at {{least not for}} passive smokers as this study could show. We conclude, the CMSS-associated PM level of every single customized brand should be measured because {{the origin of the}} tobacco and not the amount of CO, tar and nicotine (given as product information) seem to be responsible for the brand-specific PM release. This data is urgently needed to adequately inform the public about CMSS-associated PM exposure and the related health risk especially for passive smokers.|$|R

40|$|Allopolyploidy {{is a major}} {{driving force}} in plant {{evolution}} and can induce rapid structural changes in the hybrid genome. As major components of plant genomes, transposable elements are involved in these changes. In a previous work, we observed turnover of retrotransposon insertions in <b>natural</b> allotretraploid <b>tobacco</b> (Nicotiana tabacum). Here, we studied {{the early stages of}} allopolyploid formation by monitoring changes at retrotransposon insertion sites in the Th 37 synthetic tobacco. • We used sequence-specific amplification polymorphism (SSAP) to study insertion patterns of two populations of the Tnt 1 retrotransposon in Th 37 S 4 generation plants, and characterized the nature of polymorphic insertion sites. • We observed significant amplification of young Tnt 1 populations. Newly transposed copies were amplified from maternal elements and were highly similar to Tnt 1 A tobacco copies amplified in response to microbial factors. A high proportion of paternal SSAP bands were not transmitted to the hybrid, corresponding to various rearrangements at paternal insertion sites, including indels or the complete loss of the Tnt 1 /flanking junction. • These data indicate that major changes, such as retrotransposon amplification and molecular restructuring in or around insertion sites, occur rapidly in response to allopolyploidy...|$|R
40|$|Context: There is no validated, theory-based {{tool for}} {{assessing}} the onset of nicotine dependence. However, the use of all addictive substances {{can result in a}} loss of autonomy. We propose that nicotine dependence begins when autonomy is lost, ie, when the sequelae of tobacco use, either physical or psychological, present a barrier to quitting. Objectives: To test the autonomy theory of nicotine dependence, and to evaluate the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist (HONC) as a measure of the loss of autonomy over tobacco use. Design: The psychometric performance and concept validity of the HONC were evaluated in a 30 -month prospective longitudinal study of the <b>natural</b> history of <b>tobacco</b> use in a cohort of 679 seventh-grade students.
