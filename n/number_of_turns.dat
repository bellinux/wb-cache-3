5|$|The {{following}} table {{shows the}} physical {{statistics for the}} track for the various sports. It contains the competition length (start to finish, excluding braking length), the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns,</b> the vertical drop and the average grade.|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of weapons, including melee, projectile, and explosive weapons, as well as airstrike-based attacks. Some are based on real-life arms, such as the shotgun, bazooka, and hand grenade; others are rather fanciful and cartoonish, such as the sheep, which serves as a mobile explosive, and the skunk, which releases poisonous gas. In a normal match, all teams begin with the same weapons, based on the chosen weapon set. Some weapons may not become available until a certain <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> pass. Depending on the game options, additional weapons may randomly fall onto the terrain in airdropped and teleported crates. In addition to normal weapons, during team creation, each team chooses a special weapon which becomes available to them after a certain <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns.</b> The special weapons are more powerful than regular weapons and often offer special abilities; super weapons will rarely fall in weapon crates. These weapons are often based on cartoonish themes, such as the French Sheep Strike, and usually devastating in power. In homage to the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, one of the game weapons is a Holy Hand Grenade, with a sound-effect reminiscent of the Hallelujah chorus from Handel's Messiah.|$|E
5|$|Using touch controls, {{the player}} would aim {{with one of}} their {{characters}} and shoot them towards enemies like billiards, with the character bouncing off upon contact with enemies or walls until it ran out of momentum. After the player's turn was over, the enemies {{would do the same}} thing, and attack the player's characters. With a certain <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> passed, the player could choose to activate their characters' individual special attacks.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{increasing}} use of shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators, in the form of wire for advanced composite structures, enhances an urgent need {{for the development of a}} reliable and secure bonding technique for ensuring a fall stress transfer from actuators to composite structures. A new configuration of SMA wire, which is able to increase the bonding strength between the wire and matrix in the composite, is introduced. NiTi wires were twisted to certain <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> in order to increase the wire's surface roughness before embedding into epoxy matrix cylinders. Wire pullout tests were performed to study the bonding strength of a NiTi/epoxy interface. The experimental results and SEM observations indicated that the overall bonding strength and cracks on the Ti sub 2 NiO sub x film of the wires increased with increasing the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the embedded wires. These cracks can increase the surface roughness and, thus, increase the maximum pullout strength of smart composite systems. However, the maximum strain recovery limit of twisted wire is restricted to a total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> 15 <b>turns,</b> further increasing the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> results in increasing the unrecoverable strain of the wire...|$|R

5|$|By 1914, a paved county road {{connected}} Vallejo and Benicia {{north of}} the Carquinez Strait, following the present Maine Street, Benicia Road, Columbus Parkway, and K Street. Although state highways were designated to Benicia in 1910 (Legislative Route (LRN) 7, now I-680) and Vallejo in 1931 (LRN 74, now SR 29), this connection was not added until 1935, when LRN 74 (an unsigned designation) was extended east from Vallejo to Benicia and north along former Route 7 to Fairfield. (A short spur connecting Vallejo to the Carquinez Bridge was added to Route 74 in 1937.) LRN 74 initially entered Benicia on K Street and left on East Fifth Street, making several turns in between. Two realignments {{were built in the}} 1940s, reducing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> to one, at the corner of L and East Second Streets.|$|E
5|$|Each {{unit has}} their own {{character}} class, with that class determining a unit's range of movement, weapon, and strengths and weaknesses. Classes range from on-foot units like swordsmen and knights, mounted units such as the series' recurring Pegasus Knights, and magic-wielding units such as Mages. Each class also has its own battle animation. Upon performing an action in battle, characters are awarded by experience points (EXP). Upon gathering enough EXP, the character levels up, and its statistics such as defense and critical strike rate are raised randomly. Using special items, a unit's class can be evolved into an Advanced Class, changing their class and altering their statistics. A Support system exists where characters who remain {{next to each other}} for a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> talk to each other, gaining Support Points and earning stat boosts. A limit is placed on the number of Support Points that can be earned when completing a single map.|$|E
5|$|The game is turn-based. Each turn {{represents}} one week, and travelling between cities takes a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> {{depending on the}} proximity of the destination city. Many cities have a chocolate shop, where the player can sell his or her stock, and a market where ingredients can be purchased. Some specialty cacao beans can only be purchased from plantations in certain cities. Factories manufacturing chocolates produce a set amount of product every turn, as long as the required ingredients are in stock. During story mode, quests are given by non-player characters; these typically involve producing a particular volume and type of chocolate and delivering it to another non-player character, who is either traveling or can be found at a set location. Quest rewards {{take the form of a}} high price for the chocolates or a new recipe. Some encounters with characters give the player an opportunity to gamble a large amount of money on a dice roll. Market owners can be bartered with, though this carries the risk of them becoming irritated and raising prices rather than lowering them.|$|E
40|$|Processing by {{high-pressure}} torsion (HPT) {{was performed}} on disks of an Al- 7075 alloy at room temperature. The alloy was initially annealed at 753 K and then processed by HPT under a pressure of 6. 0 GPa up to a maximum <b>of</b> ten <b>turns.</b> Measurements <b>of</b> the Vickers microhardness showed lower values at the centers of the disks after small <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> but higher <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> led to a reasonable hardness homogeneity across each disk. After five turns, the grain size {{at the edge of}} the disk was ~ 250 nm. It is demonstrated that results from mechanical testing are consistent with the hardness and microstructural data. <br/...|$|R
5000|$|The maximum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> face <b>turns</b> {{needed to}} solve any {{instance}} of the Rubik's Cube is 20, and the maximum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> quarter <b>turns</b> is 26. These numbers are also the diameters of the corresponding Cayley graphs of the Rubik's Cube group.|$|R
40|$|Disks of an Al– 3 % Mg– 0. 2 % Sc alloy were {{processed}} by high-pressure torsion (HPT) {{to refine the}} grain size to ~ 0. 15 ?m. Inspection of the disks after processing revealed a central core region having a relatively coarse and ill-defined microstructure. The size of this core region decreased with increasing <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> in HPT. Measurements showed the hardness increased with increasing applied pressure and/or increasing <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns.</b> In addition, the hardness increased with increasing distance {{from the center of}} the disk and stabilized at distances greater than ~ 2 – 3 mm. The values of the saturation hardness in the outer regions of the disks were similar at higher applied pressures and after larger <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns.</b> This saturation hardness was ~ 3 × the hardness in the solution-treated condition. Within the region of hardness saturation, the microstructure was reasonably homogeneous and consisted of ultrafine grains separated by high-angle grain boundaries. Tensile testing demonstrated the occurrence of high strain rate superplasticity after HPT with elongations to failure that were similar to those obtained in samples of the same alloy {{processed by}} equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) ...|$|R
5|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} used for SMAW {{consists of a}} step-down transformer and for direct current models a rectifier, which converts alternating current into direct current. Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high-voltage alternating current, the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17–45V at currents up to 600A. A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the welding current. The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either varying the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> in the coil (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based battlefield, with {{objectives}} which range from clearing enemy groups to capturing points of importance. Each map has unique terrain to be negotiated in battle ranging from mountains to rivers and flat plains. Viewed from an overhead perspective, there are castles and locations such as shops that the player can visit, the latter of which provides a means for obtaining items. Each chapter has {{a different set of}} victory conditions, which can be related to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> taken or how the enemy force is dealt with. Battles play out using a turn-based system where each unit on both sides is given their chance to move and act. During battle, the combat screen appears, showing the fight from a sidelong perspective. Both sides move at least once, after which the combat screen fades. Battles between individual units are governed by the series' recurring Weapons Triangle, a rock–paper–scissors system where certain weapons have advantages over others — lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. As they participate in battles, each unit gains experience points (EXP) from their actions: they raise their experience level by one when they have accumulated 100 EXP. EXP can be earned in both normal battles and challenge fights in special arenas. Players can save {{at the end of each}} chapter or outside battle. They also have a single mid-chapter save available. All units are subject to permanent death: If a unit dies in battle, they are removed from the rest of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|In Fire Emblem Fates, {{the player}} begins by {{customizing}} the main character. Their gender, appearance, and name {{can be changed}} to the player's preference. At the game's beginning, there are three difficulties: Normal, Hard, and Lunatic. There are also modes that dictate the fate of characters in battle should they be defeated. In Classic Mode, a fallen unit is subject to permanent death, a recurring mode in the Fire Emblem series that removes fallen characters {{from the rest of}} the game. Casual Mode enables units to be revived at the end of a battle. The new Phoenix mode revives units on the following player turn. Each version of Fates is focused around a different gameplay style. The gameplay of Birthright is similar to the prior installment Fire Emblem Awakening and features opportunities to gain extra gold and experience. In contrast, Conquest rewards players limited experience and currency per completed map. Also included are additional objectives in battle such as defending a base or suppressing enemy forces, and some levels have a limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns.</b> Revelation uses a mixture of elements from Birthright and Conquest: while offering opportunities for gold and experience as with Birthright, it provides varied objectives and strategic elements similar to Conquest.|$|E

25|$|A {{new edition}} was {{released}} in 1994, radically changing the game play from the complex, lengthy second edition game to the simpler, more dramatic third edition game.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the influence of applied pressure on the processing of an aluminium 5483 alloy by high-pressure torsion (HPT). Discs were processed by HPT through 1 / 4 to 5 revolutions at room temperature using the two different applied pressures of 1. 0 and 6. 0 GPa. Samples were examined after HPT using microhardness measurements and transmission electron microscopy. Colour-coded maps were constructed to show the hardness distributions and the mechanical properties were evaluated by tensile testing. It is shown that the results are dependent upon the applied pressure such that a higher pressure enhances the accumulation of defects and leads to a more rapid grain refinement. The effect of pressure is especially visible {{in the early stages}} after fractional <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> since the microstructure and properties tend to homogenize at high <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns...</b>|$|R
40|$|Disks of as-extruded Mg- 4 Nd alloy were {{processed}} by high-pressure torsion (HPT) through ¼ to 5 turns at room temperature. The first 1 / 4 <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> HPT induces large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> twins and some dislocation tangles {{in the center}} region of the disk. With increase of torsional straining, the twinning is inhibited gradually and the dislocation density increases relating {{to the formation of}} dislocation substructures and ultimately transforming to high fractions of equiaxed gains which have an average grain size of ~ 200 nm and high-angle boundaries. HPT significantly improves the values of microhardness of this alloy. The hardness values in both the central and edge regions show a sharp rise after HPT for 1 / 4 turn and exhibit nearly saturation after 1 / 2 turn although there is a trend of a slight increase with increasing <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns.</b> The experimental results suggest more homogeneous microstructures may be produced by larger <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> in the HPT process...|$|R
25|$|Helical railguns are {{multi-turn}} railguns {{that reduce}} rail and brush current {{by a factor}} equal to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns.</b> Two rails are surrounded by a helical barrel and the projectile or re-usable carrier is also helical. The projectile is energized continuously by two brushes sliding along the rails, and two or more additional brushes on the projectile serve to energize and commute several windings of the helical barrel direction in front of and/or behind the projectile. The helical railgun is {{a cross between a}} railgun and a coilgun. They do not currently exist in a practical, usable form.|$|E
25|$|Combat {{takes place}} as {{two or more}} players each control one or more starships {{represented}} by counters that move across a hexagonally gridded map that may include astronomical features such as stars, planets and asteroids. Players captain their ships by allocating energy to movement and a few specialised systems {{at the start of}} each turn. The turn is divided into eight sub-steps called impulses in which movement takes place and additional energy is used to activate weapons, reinforce shields and use other shipboard systems such as transporters. Depending on the capabilities of a ship it is given a particular points value. This value is used to balance game play ensuring that one side does not have an overwhelming advantage over another and can be used to calculate victory points to determine a winner by totalling the value of destroyed or disabled vessels. Scenarios exist that allow variation in the specific winning condition, such as rescuing crew from a crippled ship, gaining sensor information from a planet, escorting a freighter or surviving for a specified <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> in the face of unbeatable odds.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to victory through conquest, 4X games often offer peaceful victory conditions or goals that involve no extermination of rival players (although war may be {{still be a}} necessary by-product of reaching said goal). For example, a 4X game may offer victory to a player who achieves a certain score or the highest score after a certain <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns.</b> Many 4X games award victory to {{the first player to}} master an advanced technology, accumulate a large amount of culture, or complete an awe-inspiring achievement. Several 4X games award [...] "diplomatic victory" [...] to anyone who can win an election decided by their rival players, or maintain peace for a specified <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns.</b>|$|E
40|$|Disks of high-purity {{aluminum}} were {{processed by}} high-pressure torsion (HPT) {{at room temperature}} under different conditions of imposed pressure and <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns.</b> Measurements were taken of the microhardness values both along diameters in each disk and following a rectilinear grid pattern to give color-coded maps of the hardness distributions. The results show the hardness increases {{by a factor of}} 2 in the first <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> HPT but the microhardness distribution is inhomogeneous because higher values of hardness are recorded in the central regions of the disks. This central region of inhomogeneity decreases with increasing <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> so that the hardness distribution becomes essentially homogeneous after five turns. The results are different from earlier reports in HPT where the central regions of the disks have a lower hardness. The results are interpreted using a model in which the degree of hardness depends upon the rate of recovery in the material...|$|R

Coins are earned mainly by winning minigames, which occur after all players have rolled the die. [...] "Party Mode" [...] is the main multiplayer mode, and involves four characters competing in a standard board game either independently or in opposing pairs.

500|$|Computer Bismarck is a turn-based {{computer}} wargame {{in which}} players control British forces against the battleship Bismarck and other German units. The German forces {{can be controlled}} by either a computer opponent (named [...] "Otto von Computer") or a second player. The game takes place on {{a map of the}} North Atlantic Ocean on which letters from the English alphabet represent military units and facilities (airfields and ports). Units have different capabilities, as well as statistics that determine their mobility, firepower, vulnerability and other gameplay factors. Turns take the form of phases, and players alternate inputting orders to maneuver their respective units. Phases can serve different functions, such as informing players of status changes, unit movement, and battles. Players earn points by destroying their opponent's units. After the Bismarck is sunk or a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> have occurred, the game ends. Depending on the number of points players have earned, either the British or German forces are declared the victor.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{impedance}} sensor {{based on}} a microfluidic chip is presented. The sensor consists of two single-layer coils and a straight micro-channel, and can detect, not only ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic particles in oil as an inductive sensor, but also, water droplets and air bubbles in oil as a capacitive sensor. The experiments are carried out at different excitation frequencies, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> coil <b>turns</b> and particle sizes. For the inductance detection, the inductance signals are found to increase with the excitation frequency and the noise is constant; both the inductance signals and the noise increase with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> coil <b>turns,</b> but because the noise increases {{at a faster rate}} than the signal, the signal-to-noise ratio decreases with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> coil <b>turns.</b> We demonstrate the successful detection of 40 μm iron particles and 110 μm copper particles using the coil with 20 turns at the excitation frequency of 2 MHz. For the capacitance detection, capacitance signals decrease with the excitation frequency and the noise is constant; the capacitance signals decrease with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> coil <b>turns,</b> while the noise increases, thus, the signal-to-noise ratio decreases with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> coil <b>turns.</b> We can detect 100 μm water droplets and 180 μm bubbles successfully using the coil with 20 turns at the excitation frequency of 0. 3 MHz...|$|R
