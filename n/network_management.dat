40|$|This paper {{argues that}} <b>networked</b> <b>management</b> {{learning}} might have specific relevance for SME management development since this model recognizes {{the importance of}} social relations and the associated relational dialogue that underpin knowledge and innovation in specific business contexts. Indeed NML reinforces the centrality of networking entrepreneurs and other relevant actors at the local level to increase the effectiveness of their actions and also helps integrate the different components of the local economy within a wider system. Drawing on sociocultural learning theories, we propose a set of learning principles to guide the design of a <b>networked</b> <b>management</b> learning action-based learning programme for SME managers...|$|R

40|$|In their {{article in}} this issue of Management Learning, Hodgson and Watland (2004) analyze the state of {{research}} in <b>networked</b> <b>management</b> learning. This is a particular type of technology-mediated learning (TML) environment where man-agers (or management students) use information and communication technolo-gies (ICT) to connect to other students, instructors or mentors as well as information resources. Computer-mediated communication, interaction and col-laboration are the hallmarks of networked learning as an educational approach. Thus it falls within the social constructionist view, which assumes that learning is constructed and emerges from dialogue with others. Hodgson and Watland (2004) argue that despite the rising importance of <b>networked</b> <b>management</b> learning, this topic has not received sufficient attention in the management education research literature. They also argue that the methods and approaches used to research this field are predominantly objectivist/ quantitative and have not been consistent with the educational principles and ideas associated with <b>networked</b> <b>management</b> learning. Therefore, they propose the use of discourse analysis and virtual ethnography as research methods for this area. While we share their concerns over the quality of <b>networked</b> <b>management</b> learning research, we feel that their proposal for the exclusive reliance on these methods to study this phenomenon is rather extreme. Our reply to this article is structured in three sections. First, we highlight areas where we clearly agree with the authors. Then, we discuss some points that we at least partially agree with them. Finally, we present some areas of likely disagree-ment with the authors and present some alternative perspectives. We must admi...|$|R
