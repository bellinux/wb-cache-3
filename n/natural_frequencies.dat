5|$|The {{study of}} {{vibrations}} in bikes includes its causes, such as engine balance, wheel balance, ground surface, and aerodynamics; its transmission and absorption; {{and its effects}} on the bike, the rider, and safety. An important factor in any vibration analysis is a comparison of the <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the system with the possible driving frequencies of the vibration sources. A close match means mechanical resonance that can result in large amplitudes. A challenge in vibration damping is to create compliance in certain directions (vertically) without sacrificing frame rigidity needed for power transmission and handling (torsionally). Another issue with vibration for the bike is the possibility of failure due to material fatigue Effects of vibration on riders include discomfort, loss of efficiency, Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome, a secondary form Raynaud's disease, and whole body vibration. Vibrating instruments may be inaccurate or difficult to read.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} may be internal to the Earth system. The Earth's {{climate system}} {{may have a}} natural resonance frequency of 100ka; that is to say, feedback processes within the climate automatically produce a 100ka effect, much as a bell naturally rings at a certain pitch. Opponents to this claim {{point out that the}} resonance would have to have developed 1 million years ago, as a 100ka periodicity was weak to non-existent for the preceding 2million years. This is feasible—continental drift and sea floor spreading rate change have been postulated as possible causes of such a change. Free oscillations of components of the Earth system have been considered as a cause, but too few Earth systems have a thermal inertia on a thousand-year timescale for any long-term changes to accumulate. The most common hypothesis looks to the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, which might expand through a few shorter cycles until large enough to undergo a sudden collapse. The 100,000-year problem has been scrutinized by José A. Rial, Jeseung Oh and Elizabeth Reischmann who find that master-slave synchronization between the climate systems <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> and the eccentricity forcing started the 100 ky ice ages of the late Pleistocene and explain their large amplitude.|$|E
25|$|When {{there are}} many degrees of freedom, one method of {{visualizing}} the mode shapes is by animating them using structural analysis software such as Femap or ANSYS. An example of animating mode shapes {{is shown in the}} figure below for a cantilevered -beam as demonstrated using modal analysis on ANSYS. In this case, the finite element method was used to generate an approximation of the mass and stiffness matrices by meshing the object of interest in order to solve a discrete eigenvalue problem. Note that, in this case, the finite element method provides an approximation of the meshed surface (for which there exists an infinite number of vibration modes and frequencies). Therefore, this relatively simple model that has over 100 degrees of freedom and hence as many <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> and mode shapes, provides a good approximation for the first <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> and modes. Generally, only the first few modes are important for practical applications.|$|E
25|$|The damped <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> is {{less than}} the undamped <b>natural</b> <b>frequency,</b> but for many {{practical}} cases the damping ratio is relatively small and hence the difference is negligible. Therefore, the damped and undamped description are often dropped when stating the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> (e.g. with 0.1 damping ratio, the damped <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> is only 1% less than the undamped).|$|R
50|$|Every object on a {{flexible}} support has a fundamental <b>natural</b> <b>frequency.</b> When vibration is applied, energy is transferred most efficiently at the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency,</b> somewhat efficiently below the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency,</b> and with increasing inefficiency (decreasing efficiency) above the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency.</b> This {{can be seen}} in the transmissibility curve, which is a plot of transmissibility vs. frequency.|$|R

25|$|The {{selective}} absorption of infrared (IR) light {{by a particular}} material occurs because the selected frequency of the light wave matches the frequency (or an integer multiple of the frequency) at which the particles of that material vibrate. Since different atoms and molecules have different <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> of vibration, they will selectively absorb different frequencies (or portions of the spectrum) of infrared (IR) light.|$|E
25|$|Phase noise {{has been}} {{optimized}} {{by raising the}} resonator’s <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> (f) and quality factors (Q). The Q specifies how long resonators continue to ring after drive to them is stopped, or equivalently when viewed as filters how narrow their pass-bands are. In particular, the Q times f, or Qf product, determines the near-carrier phase noise. Early MEMS resonators showed unacceptably low Qf products for reference. Significant theoretical work clarified the underlying physics while experimental work developed high Qf resonators. The presently available MEMS Qf performance is suitable for virtually all applications.|$|E
25|$|Note: angular {{frequency}} ω (ω=2 π f) with the units of radians per second {{is often used}} in equations because it simplifies the equations, but is normally converted to ordinary frequency (units of Hz or equivalently cycles per second) when stating the frequency of a system. If the mass and stiffness {{of the system is}} known, the formula above can determine the frequency at which the system vibrates once set in motion by an initial disturbance. Every vibrating system has one or more <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> that it vibrates at once disturbed. This simple relation can be used to understand in general what happens to a more complex system once we add mass or stiffness. For example, the above formula explains why, when a car or truck is fully loaded, the suspension feels ″softer″ than unloaded—the mass has increased, reducing the natural frequency of the system.|$|E
30|$|A second {{attempt was}} made to tune the fourth <b>natural</b> <b>frequency,</b> modifying the {{properties}} of the brace so that the fourth <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> remained constant despite variations in the stiffness of the soundboard. As can be seen in Table  6, a wider adjustment span is required for the brace in order to achieve consistency in the fourth <b>natural</b> <b>frequency.</b> This time, the frequency variation of the fourth <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> lies well below the 1 % threshold. However, the variation in the first <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> is wider than the first attempt.|$|R
30|$|Figure  4 {{shows the}} {{variation}} of the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> of the pipe for different L/R (1 [*]<[*]L/R[*]<[*] 20) with uniformly distributed pressure (q). If q is a constant value, the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> decreases as the value of L/R increases. The downtrend of <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> is much obvious when L/R ratio {{is less than a}} certain extent and when L/R increases to the value, the curve of <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> gradually flattens out. As demonstrated, if q[*]=[*] 0, when L/R[*]≤[*] 5, the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> sharply decreases as L/R ratio increases, and when L/R[*]>[*] 5, the trend gradually flattens out. If q[*]=[*] 5 MPa, when L/R[*]≤[*] 4, the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> sharply decreases as L/R ratio increases, and when L/R[*]>[*] 4, the trend gradually flattens out. If q[*]=[*] 10 MPa, when L/R[*]≤[*] 3, the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> sharply decreases as L/R ratio increases, and when L/R[*]>[*] 3, the trend gradually flattens out. If q[*]=[*] 20 MPa, when L/R[*]≤[*] 2.5, the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> sharply decreases as L/R ratio increases, and when L/R[*]>[*] 2.5, the trend gradually flattens out. These all express that, for the curve of variation of <b>natural</b> <b>frequency,</b> there is a critical value before it slows down and the point of the critical value moves to the left as q increases, and the moving amplitude also slowly becomes smaller as q increases.|$|R

40|$|The {{laser tracker}} is {{composed}} of a mechanical structure and a servo control system.

In the dynamic characteristics, the mechanical structure has its <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> and the servo control system has servo bandwidth. If the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> closes to the servo bandwidth, the noise produced by system will have an influence on the stability and measure precision of the turntable.

Based on this relationship between the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> and servo bandwidth, construct and simplify a 3 D model, analyze the influence of material stiffness, friction and rotary inertia on the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> of a self-developed laser tracker turntable. Analysis shows that the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> augments with the increase of material stiffness and reduction of rotary inertia and has nothing to do with friction.
