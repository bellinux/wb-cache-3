50|$|Many {{human blood}} cells, such as {{red blood cells}} (RBCs), immune cells, and even {{platelets}} all originate from the same progenitor cell, the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). As these cells are short-lived, {{there needs to be}} a steady turnover of new blood cells and the maintenance of an HSC pool. This is broadly termed hematopoiesis. This event requires a special environment, termed the hematopoietic stem cell niche, which provides the protection and signals necessary to carry out the differentiation of cells from HSC progenitors. This niche relocates from the yolk sac to eventually rest in the bone marrow of mammals. Many pathological states can arise from disturbances in this <b>niche</b> <b>environment,</b> highlighting its importance in maintaining hematopoiesis.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{studies have}} used hypoxic-staining dyes, such as Hoechst stain, {{to show that}} {{quiescent}} LT-HSCs and osteoblasts are found in hypoxic and poorly perfused areas of the bone marrow, while ECs and MSCs were found in well-perfused areas. However, this hypoxia may be only caused {{in part by the}} <b>niche</b> <b>environment,</b> and the HSCs themselves may be maintaining their hypoxic environment in order to remain quiescent. This oxygen tension upregulates HIF1A, which shifts energy production to glycolysis, allowing for the cell to survive in oxygen-poor surroundings. Indeed, deletion of HIF1A increases HSC proliferation and eventually depletes the LT-HSC storage pool. This suggests that the hypoxic environment of the bone marrow, partially determined by the distance from the sinusoids of the perivascular niche, maintains the quiescent state of LT-HSCs in an effort to retain stem cells with differentiation potential.|$|E

Here, we show that activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling promotes spermatogonial differentiation and reduces the GFRα 1 + cell pool. We further discovered that SHISA 6 is a cell-autonomous Wnt inhibitor that is expressed in a restricted subset of GFRα 1 + cells and confers resistance to the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Shisa 6 + cells appear to show stem cell-related characteristics, conjectured from the morphology and long-term fates of T (Brachyury) + cells that are found largely overlapped with Shisa 6 + cells.

40|$|With the {{development}} of medical technology, more and more parameters are produced to describe the human physiological condition, forming high-dimensional clinical datasets. In clinical analysis, data are commonly utilized to establish mathematical models and carry out classification. High-dimensional clinical data will increase the complexity of classification, which is often utilized in the models, and thus reduce efficiency. The Niche Genetic Algorithm (NGA) is an excellent algorithm for dimensionality reduction. However, in the conventional NGA, the niche distance parameter is set in advance, which prevents it from adjusting to the environment.

Here, we describe a modular system for the generation of artificial thymopoietic environments in the mouse embryo. Thymic epithelium that lacks hematopoietic function but is physiologically accessible for hematopoietic progenitor cells is functionalized by individual and combinatorial expression of four factors, the chemokines Ccl 25 and Cxcl 12, the cytokine Scf, and the Notch ligand DLL 4. The distinct phenotypes and variable numbers of hematopoietic cells in the resulting epithelial environments reveal synergistic, context-dependent, and hierarchical interactions among effector molecules.
