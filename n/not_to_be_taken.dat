5|$|After {{moderate}} {{sales of}} their debut album Cheshire Cat (1995), released on independent record label Cargo Music, Blink-182 enjoyed {{a small amount}} of success. Throughout 1994 and 1995, the trio vigorously toured nonstop and grew in popularity, mostly in Australia, where audiences embraced the band's irreverent sense of humor and stage shows. When the trio grew frustrated when fans lamented the inability to purchase Cheshire Cat at their respective local record stores, they began to turn toward other record labels to achieve wider distribution than Cargo. By the end of 1995, problems had become apparent between the trio and the label, who regarded the band as a joke <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> seriously.|$|E
5|$|Jewish legend {{records that}} Samson's {{shoulders}} were sixty cubits broad. (Many Talmudic commentaries, however, explain {{that this is}} <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> literally, for a person that size could not live normally in society. Rather, it means {{that he had the}} ability to carry a burden 60 cubits wide (approximately 30 meters) on his shoulders). He was lame in both feet but, when the spirit of God came upon him, he could step with one stride from Zorah to Eshtaol, while the hairs of his head arose and clashed against one another so that they could be heard for a like distance. Samson was said to be so strong that he could uplift two mountains and rub them together like two s of earth, yet his superhuman strength, like Goliath's, brought woe upon its possessor.|$|E

5|$|Some common {{structures}} {{are shown in}} figures 3 and 4, along with their lumped-element counterparts. These lumped-element approximations are <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> as equivalent circuits {{but rather as a}} guide to the behaviour of the distributed elements over a certain frequency range. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show a short-circuit and open-circuit stub, respectively. When the stub length is λ/4, these behave, respectively, as anti-resonators and resonators and are therefore useful, respectively, as elements in band-pass and band-stop filters. Figure 3(c) shows a short-circuited line coupled to the main line. This also behaves as a resonator, but is commonly used in low-pass filter applications with the resonant frequency well outside the band of interest. Figures 3(d) and 3(e) show coupled line structures which are both useful in band-pass filters. The structures of figures 3(c) and 3(e) have equivalent circuits involving stubs placed in series with the line. Such a topology is straightforward to implement in open-wire circuits but not with a planar technology. These two {{structures are}} therefore useful for implementing an equivalent series element.|$|E

500|$|Henry Paulet {{was born}} in 1767, the younger son of George Paulet, 12th Marquess of Winchester, and a brother to Charles Paulet, the future 13th Marquess of Winchester. Paulet joined the navy as a {{midshipman}} during the later years of the American War of Independence. He spent 11 years at this rank, during which time he was present at Admiral Sir George Rodney's victory at the Battle of the Saintes.

500|$|According to Antony Polonsky, General Stefan Grot-Rowecki, the Home Army's commander, made {{it clear}} in an order of 10 November 1942 that the Home Army did not regard the Jews as [...] "part of our nation", and that action was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to defend them if it {{endangered}} other Home Army objectives. Joshua D. Zimmerman disputes such a description of Rowecki, noting {{that he was willing}} to provide the Jews with aid and resources when it contributed to the greater war effort, but that he had concluded that providing large supplies of arms to the Jews would be ineffectual. Zimmerman writes that Rowecki was [...] "clearly sympathetic to the Jews and eager to help", and that his reasoning was the norm among the Western Allies, whose reaction to news of the Holocaust was that only regular military action against Nazi Germany could halt it. Zimmerman further writes that, while Polonsky was right that at that time Rowecki did not see the Jews as part of the Polish nation, and that his support for them was limited, his (and the Home Army's) attitude would shift substantially in coming months as the brutal reality of the Holocaust became more apparent, and Polish public opinion's support for the Jewish resistance would increase.|$|E

Jesus' words are <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> literally — we should seek the supercelestial [...] meaning in which the true route to salvation is revealed. The holding of material wealth in itself is not a wrong, {{as long as it is}} used charitably, but men should be careful not to let their wealth dominate their spirit. It is more important to give up sinful passions than external wealth. If the rich man is to be saved, all he must do is to follow the two commandments, and while material wealth is of no value to God, it can be used to alleviate the suffering of our neighbor.|$|E

The Grundtvigians represented a nationalistic and liberal religious tradition, in staunch contrast to pietists and fundamentalists in the Church Association for the Inner Mission in Denmark. Grundtvigians believed in celebrating life, but they lived for the present, and were often nicknamed [...] "Happy Danes". While salvation was {{the gift of}} Christianity, being saved was not a focus. The Bible was the Holy Book, but was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> literally, and the Apostles' Creed rather than the Bible was their source of Christianity.

The Grundtvigians stressed four elects of a [...] "true people": a common land, a common language, a common history and forefathers, and common culture through songs, folk dancing, language, cuisine, etc. Grundtvigians established Danebod to [...] "save the Danes from total Americanization", and the colony's only written and spoken language remained Danish for several decades after its establishment. On Sunday, June28, 1885, the pioneers arranged a festival to celebrate the new colony.

Paul, in a letter to Brimhall, had written Chamberlin was [...] "one of the world's foremost naturalists, though, I think, he is only about 28 years of age. I have not met his equal... We must not let him drift away". Chamberlin oversaw expanded biology course offerings and led insect-collecting trips with students. Chamberlin joined a pair of newly hired brothers on the faculty, Joseph and Henry Peterson, who taught psychology and education. Chamberlin and the two Petersons worked to increase the intellectual standing of the University. In 1909 Chamberlin's own brother William H. Chamberlin {{was hired to}} teach philosophy. The four academics, all active members of the Church, were known for teaching modern scientific and philosophic ideas and encouraging lively debate and discussion. The Chamberlins and Petersons held the belief that the theory of evolution was compatible with religious views, and promoted historical criticism of the Bible, the view that the writings contained should be viewed from the context of the time: Ralph Chamberlin published essays in the White and Blue, BYU's student newspaper, arguing that Hebrew legends and historical writings were <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> literally. In an essay titled [...] "" [...] Chamberlin concluded: [...] "Only the childish and immature mind can lose by learning that much in the Old Testament is poetical and that some of the stories are not true historically."
