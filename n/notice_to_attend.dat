The policeman took your names and addresses, and will have told the officer in charge of the case the nature of the evidence you will probably give.

Religious organizations are required to inform the Federal Registration Service (FRS) of changes in leadership or address within 3 days of the changes taking effect. The law allows FRS to file suit against organizations that fail {{to comply with the}} law's requirements. If a court finds in favor of FRS, then the organization may be closed down. In addition, a contemporaneous amendment to the Civil Code may affect religious organizations, but the effect of this amendment and all other amendments remains to be seen. Some denominations with numerous local organizations feared that compliance with these changes would be highly burdensome.|$|E
50|$|In Western Australia, as of August 2011: A person {{found in}} {{possession}} of 10 g or less of cannabis will receive a Cannabis Intervention Requirement <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> a mandatory one on one counselling session. Quantities larger than this attract a penalty of A$2000 or two years in jail, or both. A person found {{in possession of}} more than 100g of cannabis would be deemed to have that quantity for supply and could face a penalty of A$20,000 or two years in jail. It is also illegal for cannabis smoking implements to be displayed in shops or sold, with fines up to A$10,000 for sales to adults and jail {{for up to two}} years or a fine of up to A$24,000 for selling to minors. Opposing political sides have accused the government of changing the laws to appear tough on drugs in response to an increased public fear of clandestine drug labs following a number of them exploding in suburban areas, such as the Lilac Pass Incident.|$|E

40|$|Monkeys with {{bilateral}} {{removal of}} caudal prefrontal cortex (area 8) or dorso-lateral parietal cortex (areas 5 and 7) or the inferior temporal cortex (area TE) {{were presented with}} two versions of a go-left/go-right visuo-spatial discrimination. In the first task they had to displace either {{the left or right}} of two identical plaques according to whether both plaques were black or white respectively. There were no performance differences among groups. In the second task, the two plaques were always red and the appropriate response was indicated by whether a spatially remote third plaque was black or white. Both the prefrontal and parietal groups were impaired relative to the inferotemporal group on this task. The results indicate that whether an impairment occurs on a task that is thought to test the perception of egocentric space may depend on whether the animal has <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> and <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> a remote cue, and that an attentional disorder may also explain impairments reported on tests of allocentric perception where the critical cue is spatially remote from the response site...|$|R
30|$|As for students’ {{language}} errors, {{the interview}} {{data indicated that}} the three teachers thought selective CF should be delivered on student oral presentations. For instance, Liu thought that language errors in particular should be selectively corrected. She said, “I think priority can be given to those errors that impact our comprehension like phonological errors”. Liu’s belief coincided with that of Han who argued {{that he did not}} want to fix every mistake, especially every grammatical error in student speech. Han explained that too much error correction may do harm to the teacher-student relationship and student confidence to speak up. This belief of the benefits of selectively <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> spoken errors (also called focused CF in written feedback research) also wins support of many researchers in the field of written feedback. Focused written CF facilitates L 2 learners’ better understanding of the errors since learners are more likely <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> and <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> the feedback when a limited number of written error types is marked (Bitchener and Ferris 2012, Ellis, Sheen, Murakami and Takashima 2008). Instead, unfocused written CF can result in “information overload” (Bitchener 2008, p. 109) when students process the feedback.|$|R

40|$|The Driver Intervention Program (DIP) is a 90 -minute interactive, small-group {{workshop}} for disqualified L- or P-plate drivers, aged 25 and under, living in Adelaide {{and in some}} rural centres close to Adelaide. The present paper compares the subsequent crash and driving offence experience of two groups of offending drivers: those attending DIP, and those who should have attended DIP but chose not to and pay an expiation fee instead. No experiment was performed: the drivers themselves chose {{whether or not to}} attend the DIP, and any difference between DIP and Expiation groups in subsequent crashes and offences could be due not to attendance at DIP but instead to pre-existing differences between the groups (in geographical, social, psychological, and other factors). Licence numbers of drivers eligible for DIP (i. e., who had committed an offence) were matched against the database of crashes and against the database of driving offences. The sample consisted of those sent their first <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Attend</b> in 2001 or 2002. The following results refer to the 18 months following the issuing of a <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Attend</b> DIP. There was no evidence that the DIP group had a lower rate of crashes than the Expiation group, but it did have an appreciably lower rate of moving offences and a much lower rate of administrative offences than the Expiation group. Our interpretation is that the DIP is having no substantial effect, and that the differences between groups in respect of driving offences are due to the factors that influence the decision whether to attend DIP or not. Note, however, that the DIP is a very cheap countermeasure, and thus we cannot say that the DIP is not cost-effective. There is literature on effects of various interventions on offences differing from their effects on crashes. A likely explanation is that linkage of behaviour to crashes is looser than linkage of behaviour to being caught offending. Craig Kloeden and Paul Hutchinson[URL]...|$|E

40|$|Objective: This article {{reports on}} the {{evaluation}} of The School Attendance Demonstration Pro-ject (SADP). SADP is an intervention aimed at improving the school attendance rates of 16 - to 18 -year-olds receiving public assistance. Method: Experimental group students attending school less than 80 % of the time received a <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> an orientation for services. Students who continued to attend school less than 80 %, {{did not attend the}} orientation, and could not show good cause for attendancewere sanctioned. The study used a control groupwith random assign-ment. Results: Data show that in any month, more experimental group students met the atten-dance rule than did control group students. Logistic regression predicted that females, Hispanics, students from single-parent families, and those attending alternative schools had dif-ficulty meeting attendance requirements. Conclusions: The findings suggest that at-risk teens need alternative strategies from sanctions to encourage school attendance.

This work culminated {{with a public}} performance of the game-choreographies created and post show discussion, at Siobhan Davies Studios, London. The four days’ work focussed on using Le Roys ‘General Rules Score for Project’ to discover the remit of game based choreography. The questions which emerged throughout the process and framed the work include: What is a rule and what is a task? How can rules enable a system of logic to appear? What is the aim of a rule inside a game and how does this shape the overall aim of a game? Does a game need to be finite or infinite to be satisfying to play and spectate?

Chancing upon a familiar {{name in the}} obituary <b>notices,</b> he decides <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> the funeral of an acquaintance he has not seen for many years. After the service, he is approached by a stranger who introduces himself as the deceased woman's solicitor.

Later, on his trip back to London, Braddock reminisces about those days of his youth in 1909, when he met the beautiful and mysterious Elizabeth. Equally mysterious was the death (and life) of her husband, Baron Ravenscliff, born John William Stone. Later, Braddock opens the long-delayed package to find a pair of extraordinary manuscripts. These two documents, written accounts of events occurring in 1890 and 1867 respectively, follow Braddock's recollections to form the three-part structure of the historical-mystery novel Stone's Fall.|$|R

30|$|Lampert et al. (Lampert 2010; Lampert et al. 2013) {{have argued}} that rehearsals are a {{particularly}} powerful tool for the professional preparation of beginning teachers. Engaging in thoughtfully constructed rehearsals can support novice teachers to gain practical experience managing a realistic and intellectually ambitious learning environment. Among other things, rehearsals allow teachers to practice eliciting and responding to students’ ideas in ways that meet defined instructional goals. In addition, feedback and reflection from rehearsals can inform planning strategies and generate new ideas (Horn and Little 2010). Benedict-Chambers (2016) proposed that rehearsals can be utilized to build beginning teachers’ understanding {{of the complexity of}} classroom interactions and <b>to</b> help them <b>notice</b> and <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> critical features of instruction. We suggest that these same benefits apply to novice PD facilitators or those learning an innovative PD program. For mathematics PD leaders, participating in one or more rehearsals as part of the preparation process provides an opportunity to gain mathematical knowledge for professional development that can directly impact fidelity and promote productive (or no impact) adaptations.|$|R

Two positive politeness strategies were identified, the first is <b>noticing</b> and <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> interviewer’s interests, wants, needs or goods, and second is raising/asserting common grounds to establish solidarity. One negative politeness strategy was identified which is requesting for clarification or repetition.
