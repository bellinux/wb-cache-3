5|$|St. John's, and the {{province}} as a whole, was gravely affected in the 1990s {{by the collapse}} of the northern cod fishery, which had been the driving force of the provincial economy for hundreds of years. After a decade of high unemployment rates and depopulation, the city's proximity to the Hibernia, Terra Nova and White Rose oil fields led to an economic boom that spurred population growth and commercial development. As a result, the St. John's area <b>now</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> about half of {{the province}}'s economic output.|$|E

25|$|The island's {{economy has}} grown {{significantly}} {{over the last}} decade in key areas of innovation. Aerospace, Bioscience, ICT and Renewable energy have been a focus for growth and diversification. Aerospace alone <b>now</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> over 25% of the province's international exports and is the island's fourth largest industry at $355 million in annual sales. The Bioscience industry employs over 1300 people and generates over $150 million in sales.|$|E
25|$|Saffron's {{taste and}} {{iodoform}} or hay-like fragrance {{result from the}} chemicals picrocrocin and safranal. It also contains a carotenoid pigment, crocin, which imparts a rich golden-yellow hue to dishes and textiles. Its recorded history is attested in a 7th-century BC Assyrian botanical treatise compiled under Ashurbanipal, {{and it has been}} traded and used for over four millennia. Iran <b>now</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> approximately 90% of the world production of saffron.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, Asian economies {{have been}} {{developing}} rapidly providing significant demand for New Zealand's exports. New Zealand trades with Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, India and the Philippines and this <b>now</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> around 16% of total exports. New Zealand initiated {{a free trade}} agreement with Singapore in September 2000 which was extended in 2005 to include Chile and Brunei and is now known as the P4 agreement.|$|E

25|$|France {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{countries}} to create an environment ministry, in 1971. Although it is one of the most industrialised countries in the world, France is ranked only 17th by carbon dioxide emissions, behind less populous nations such as Canada or Australia. This is because France decided to invest in nuclear power following the 1973 oil crisis, which <b>now</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> 75% of its electricity production and results in less pollution.|$|E
25|$|On November 22, 2011, Pandora {{reported}} its Q3 earnings. Royalty costs {{accounted for}} 50% of revenue, {{slightly better than}} expected. Its revenue, most of it from advertising, continues to rise at respectable rates. Not only has Pandora attracted more users but {{the average number of}} hours per user have also increased. Pandora <b>now</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> an estimated 4% of total US listening hours. As Pandora grows, it hopes to gain leverage on music labels and drive royalty costs down.|$|E
25|$|This {{scientific}} breakthrough established standards {{and became an}} agent of change for women suffering from the afflictions of infertility and for women {{who did not want}} to pass on genetic disorders to their children. Donor embryo transfer has given women a mechanism to become pregnant and give birth to a child that will contain their husband’s genetic makeup. Although donor embryo transfer as practiced today has evolved from the original non-surgical method, it <b>now</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> approximately 5% of in vitro fertilization recorded births.|$|E

25|$|An {{unintended}} {{benefit of}} the round goby's introduction is that the Lake Erie watersnake, once listed as a threatened species, has found the goby to be a tasty addition to its diet. A recent study found the introduced fish <b>now</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> up to 90% of the snake's diet. The new food supply means that the water snake is now staging a comeback. Round gobies also serve as food {{for a variety of}} predatory fishes in the Great Lakes, including bass, lake trout, lake whitefish, burbot, and walleye.|$|E
25|$|As of 2012, Russia {{has managed}} to {{maintain}} its position as the number two exporter of arms {{to the world in}} spite of losing sales some markets such as Libya and India, by selling products to new markets in Africa and Latin America.“Between 2012 and 2015, India will once again become the number one importer ($14.3 billion), followed by Venezuela ($3.2 billion) instead of Algeria. Vietnam will rank third, with imports of $3.2 billion.that the Asia-Pacific <b>now</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> {{more than half of the}} company's deliveries. In recent years Russia approved about $7 billion worth of export loans under weapons contracts. This has enabled Rosoboron export to sign new deals with Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} {{treatment of}} OPC was surgical, with an approach through {{the neck and}} splitting of the jaw bone, {{which resulted in a}} considerable risk of death. Later, radiotherapy with or without the addition of chemotherapy, provided a less invasive alternative, and the results in terms of treating the cancer, were comparable. Newer minimally invasive surgical techniques through the mouth have improved outcomes, and surgery is often followed by radiation and or chemotherapy in high risk cases. In the absence of high quality evidence, management decisions are often based on technical factors, likely functional loss and the persons preferences. Some HPV+OPC may first appear in lymph nodes in the neck, without an obvious source (cancer of unknown primary origin) but removal of tonsil tissue from the oropharynx will often show hidden disease. The presence of HPV in the tumour is associated with a better response to treatment and a better outcome, independent of the treatment methods used and a nearly 60% reduced risk of dying from the cancer. Most recurrence occurs locally and within the first year after treatment. The use of tobacco decreases the chances of survival. While most head and neck cancer has been declining with reduced smoking rates, HPV+OPC has been increasing. Compared to HPV-OPC patients, HPV+OPC patients tend to be younger, have a higher socioeconomic status and are less likely to smoke. In addition they tend to have smaller tumours, but {{are more likely to have}} involvement of the cervical lymph nodes. In the United States and other countries, the number of cases of oropharyngeal cancer has been increasing steadily, with the incidence of HPV+OPC increasing faster than the decline in HPV-OPC. The increase is seen particularly in young men in developed countries, and HPV+OPC <b>now</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> the majority of all OPC cases.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1950s, {{companies}} such as Johnson and Johnson, Kendall, Parke-Davis, Playtex, and Molnlycke entered the disposable diaper market, and in 1956, Procter & Gamble began researching disposable diapers. Victor Mills, along with his project group including William Dehaas (both men {{who worked for the}} company) invented what would be trademarked [...] "Pampers". Although Pampers were conceptualized in 1959, the diapers themselves were not launched into the market until 1961. Pampers <b>now</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> more than $10 billion in annual revenue at Procter & Gamble.|$|E
2500|$|According to a 1995 census, Cabinda had an {{estimated}} population of 600,000, approximately 400,000 of whom live in neighbouring countries. Population estimates are, however, highly unreliable. Consisting largely of tropical forest, Cabinda produces hardwoods, coffee, cocoa, crude rubber and palm oil. The product {{for which it}} is best known, however, is its oil, which has given it the nickname, [...] "the Kuwait of Africa". Cabinda's petroleum production from its considerable offshore reserves <b>now</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> more than half of Angola's output. Most of the oil along its coast was discovered under Portuguese rule by the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company (CABGOC) from 1968 onwards.|$|E

My back-of-the-envelope calculation is that the Commission <b>now</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> less than 1/2000th of 1 percent of the federal budget; back in the late 1950s its size would have been roughly similar.
