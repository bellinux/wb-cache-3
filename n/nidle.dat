25|$|Some NESARA detractors {{claim that}} NESARA is a cult {{designed}} primarily {{to provide an}} income to Goodwin and others. They {{point to the fact}} that Goodwin, Lee, and <b>Nidle</b> frequently asked their readers to donate money. Goodwin, who also asked readers to donate their frequent flyer miles, claimed that she needed and had used the funds to travel to various locations around the world to secretly meet with high-level government officials about getting NESARA announced.|$|E
2500|$|Some NESARA {{supporters}} {{also make}} the claim that otherworldly beings are working to get NESARA announced. These include a [...] "channeled" [...] cosmic being called [...] "Hatonn" [...] (an android Pleiadean), and another named Sananda. According to some Ascended Master Teaching proponents such as Joshua David Stone, Sheldan <b>Nidle,</b> and Luis Prada, Sananda is the [...] "galactic name" [...] of Ascended Master Jesus, which he uses {{in his role as}} Commander-in-Chief of the Ashtar Command flying saucer fleet. Pallas Athena is regarded as being the Vice-Commander of the saucer fleet. Ashtar (Ashtar Sheran) is regarded in these teachings as being third-in-command. Saint Germain, an Ascended Master borrowed from the I AM Movement and the Church Universal and Triumphant, along with benevolent aliens from the Galactic Federation, are also frequently mentioned (most prominently by <b>Nidle)</b> as working towards the NESARA announcement. The designation of George W. Bush as a disguised reptilian often co-occurs with this claim. Goodwin has claimed that Ascended Master Saint Germain has come down from the etheric plane to physically meet with heads of banks and world leaders regarding the NESARA announcement.|$|E
2500|$|After Goodwin began {{commenting on}} NESARA, other internet-based {{conspiracy}} theorists latched onto it. One supporter, Sheldan <b>Nidle,</b> ties the imminent NESARA announcement into his years-old prophecy of an imminent large scale UFO visitation by benevolent aliens (occasionally on his website reports, but more prominently in his videos, seminars and public appearances). Jennifer Lee, {{who used to}} publish internet NESARA status reports almost daily on her now defunct site, discussed a host of other-worldly and [...] "interdimensional" [...] beings who are helping {{behind the scenes to}} get NESARA announced. Internet evangelist [...] Sherry Shriner, who operates many websites, sees NESARA as linked to malevolent reptiloid aliens she feels have long controlled the U.S. Government.|$|E
5000|$|According to <b>Nidle’s</b> channelling, the Federation {{remained}} “dedicated {{to massive}} first contact {{as soon as}} possible” but the spiritual transformation {{of the human being}} into the divine form was now the main focus. The Earth rulers were identified as a secret cabal who have negatively directed humanity for millennia, but would be slowly removed by the Federation. ‘Star Gates’ were being placed in the upper atmosphere to aid transformation, and special ‘Galactic and Medical Teams’ were assisting people when they slept.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Nidle</b> {{is known}} for his {{prediction}} that the world would end on December 17, 1996. <b>Nidle,</b> then residing in Walnut Creek, California, predicted that it would happen with the arrival of 16 million spaceships and a host of angels from the [...] "photon belt". When this did not occur, <b>Nidle</b> claimed the angels had transferred humanity into a holographic projection in order to give it a second chance.|$|E
50|$|Following his prediction's failure, <b>Nidle</b> {{removed all}} {{reference}} to {{it from his}} website.|$|E
50|$|Another sweet kind of Wähe is the Nidle-Cake, {{made from}} a cast of cream (<b>Nidle),</b> eggs and sugar.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nidle</b> was [...] "awarded" [...] a Pigasus award, {{an award}} {{designed}} to expose psychic frauds, for his failed prediction.|$|E
50|$|Advocates of {{the concept}} of star people / starseeds include Sheldan <b>Nidle,</b> who founded the Planetary Activation Organization. There is an online following.|$|E
50|$|In general, <b>Nidle</b> {{has managed}} the failed prophecy by {{engaging}} in what J Gordon Melton states is a reconceptualization {{through the process of}} spiritualisation: a UFO landing with advanced technology is changed into a need to raise humanity spiritually by humans themselves. In the case of the Ground Crew, <b>Nidle</b> “refashions his following from a passive audience of ‘netheads’ waiting to be ‘zapped’ by a superior alien technology into involved participants” who form committees of activists helping Mother Earth and humanity.|$|E
5000|$|... 1996 — Sheldan <b>Nidle</b> who {{predicted}} {{the end of}} the world on December 17, 1996, then explained that it came, but we were all unaware of it.|$|E
50|$|Sheldan <b>Nidle</b> (born November 11, 1946 in New York City) is {{the founder}} of the Planetary Activation Organization. He states he is capable of telepathic {{communications}} and is in contact with extraterrestrials.|$|E
5000|$|In December 1997 <b>Nidle</b> {{split with}} Valerie Donnell, his {{secretary}} and the Ground Crew’s chief administrator, {{for reasons that}} weren’t clear as both parties posted alternative accounts of the schism. However, Donna appeared a rather “comic character” whose postings undermined the “more lofty, aesthetic standards of Nidle’s prose”. [...] But she also took {{the rights to the}} Ground Crew name and website with her, forcing <b>Nidle</b> to start a new organisation. Donner maintained the Ground Crew website, posting channelled messages with a UFO content which included the Galactic Federation. However the website focussed on personal spiritual transformation and came from a more new age angle: angels, fairies, telepathy, communing with plants, etc.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nidle</b> {{founded the}} Planetary Activation Organization (PAO) in 1997, a {{movement}} which {{grew out of}} his Ground Crew Project group of the 1980s. The PAO predicted that 10,000 alien ambassadors would arrive on Earth in 1997. The PAO also predicted that benevolent extraterrestrials would help transform the earth into a terrestrial paradise {{by the end of}} the year 2012.|$|E
50|$|The Naked City Coffee House {{grew out}} of Naked City {{magazine}} (which for a time had offices at 107 Brighton Avenue) published by Al <b>Nidle</b> who later founded the Zeitgeist Gallery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Naked City Coffee House was a weekly open mic forum for singer/songwriters and poets. It is where folk singer/songwriter Dar Williams performed for the first time.|$|E
5000|$|Sheldon <b>Nidle</b> {{claims he}} had {{extraterrestrial}} and UFO experiences {{shortly after his}} birth on November 11, 1946. [...] Claiming he was contacted by ETs from the planet Sirius, [...] <b>Nidle</b> stated that his experiences consisted of such events as telepathic communication, being taught aboard spacecraft, and gaining knowledge from ‘direct core implants’. In 1994 he published a book You’re Becoming a Galactic Human in which he describes a boyhood encounter with extraterrestrials who landed in his backyard. Since 1955, he has claimed to be in regular communication with ETs through telepathy and ‘direct core knowledge inserts’. However, he states {{that when he was}} 14 years old, he put an end to extraterrestrial communication because he was expected to fulfil his mission as a 'star seed from Sirius', and there was too much conflict between terrestrial and extraterrestrial knowledge. He then became vice-president of the Amateur Astronomers Club and worked on a film on Nikola Tesla.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nidle</b> and the Ground Crew blamed {{repeated}} failed prophecies {{on various}} external factors. By June 1997, other worldly and interstellar dark forces {{were said to}} have conspired with ‘planetary elites’ and held up the intentions of the Galactic Federation which had underestimated the situation, but could not be deterred. At the same time, messages began to deny the relevance of any specific arrival date and talked about “the right divine time”.|$|E

50|$|The {{channelling}} {{claimed that}} human structures {{would be destroyed}} {{in the process of}} photon belt activation, and the only safe places would be underground or inside spaceships. According to the early channellings, only extraterrestrial intervention by the Galactic Federation could save most of humanity. <b>Nidle</b> channelled the narrative on at least a weekly basis, claiming that huge underground chambers were being drilled, and massive spaceships were being prepared to house humans who would join a deep space brotherhood.|$|E
5000|$|Some NESARA {{supporters}} {{also make}} the claim that otherworldly beings are working to get NESARA announced. These include a [...] "channeled" [...] cosmic being called [...] "Hatonn" [...] (an android Pleiadean), and another named Sananda.

50|$|After {{the mass}} suicide of Heaven’s Gate members, Valerie Donner, a core member, distanced the Ground Crew from such “ridiculous acts of self-destruction”. Two {{days before the}} {{scheduled}} event, <b>Nidle</b> posted that instead of a mass landing, a meeting between a shuttle from the comet and a shuttle from the “Galactic Federation Fleet” had taken place just south of Ayers Rock in Australia. A special ceremony had been conducted and vital papers had been exchanged. After May 10 there was no further mention of the comet or its occupants.|$|E
5000|$|The {{core of the}} Photon Belt beliefs is {{that there}} is an immense belt of photons {{orbiting}} around the Pleiades. According to some New Age beliefs, Earth will pass through this belt of photons, resulting either in humanity's elevation to a higher plane of existence, the end of the world, or both. Authors Virginia Essene (born July 19, 1928) and Sheldon <b>Nidle</b> write that the Photon Belt represents a temporary window for spiritual transition during which time humans can reach a higher level of existence, which they term the [...] "galactic" [...] level.|$|E
5000|$|The December 1996 mass landing {{failed to}} eventuate - but <b>Nidle</b> {{continued}} to spread 'messages' from the Galactic Federation that the spaceships would appear soon. Further dates that were named {{and did not}} deliver a landing were the Gregorian New Year, and the spring of 1997. Delays were blamed on a solar storm and the instability of the planet. Many attractive glimpses {{of life in the}} new cosmic environment continued to be channeled. [...] In February 1997, amazing details about the comet Hale-Bopp were communicated, and in March 1997 the number of space ships in the landing fleet was increased to 25 million.|$|E

5000|$|Rickheit {{followed}} these up with {{a longer}} work, Kill, Kill, Kill. In the late 1990s, Rickheit moved to the Boston area where he was deeply involved with the Zeitgeist Gallery located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. With the support and assistance of the gallerys owner, Alan <b>Nidle,</b> he started a publication the short-lived publication Cambridge Inferno for more general audiences {{as a vehicle to}} showcase local cartoonists. He was also the gallerys projectionist, and programmed series and comics festivals there and in the greater Boston area. He also dabbled in music and performance art, playing [...] "Doctor Selenium" [...] in a performance collaboration with musician Katt Hernandez, and working on Empire S.N.A.F.U. Restoration Project events.|$|E
5000|$|This online, millenarian {{narrative}} functions so like {{fiction that}} Palmer and Helland have devoted an article to a literary/aesthetic {{analysis of the}} religion rather than the normal sociological discussion. Following the literary critic Austin Wright, they explore the discourse as a literary art form. Virtual reality is the vehicle of the myth - which conveys “a vivid imaginary world and… an intense mood of apocalyptic expectancy” for its participants. They also show how <b>Nidle</b> moves from the self-generated fictional world to the narrator-controlled fictional world as the prophecies fail. [...] They comment that the instant inception, rapid evolution and spectacular metamorphoses of religions on the internet will continue to dazzle scholars who surf the web.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in November 1996, <b>Nidle</b> ‘channeled’ a {{narrative}} {{that was an}} urgent call to humanity and involved an imminent apocalypse due to a planetary transformation of Earth. He claimed to be leading a mission on Earth for the “Galactic Federation of Planets,” in order to prepare the world for this coming transformation supposed to occur as the planet passes {{into the path of}} a cosmic ‘photon belt', an area of outer space that he claimed had high energy properties similar to the plasma in the atmosphere of stars. [...] His narrative stated that the photon belt would aid Earth’s transformation into a pristine state and restore the superhuman abilities of humanity by gradually transforming the genetic codes of all humanity from a double-helix DNA to a 12-helix DNA pattern. [...] The “dormant” pineal gland would be activated and an immediate healing process would take place. [...] It was expected that the human body, having lost certain cosmic capabilities in the past, would regain its galactic ability to rejuvenate itself, overcome illness and aging, and become telepathic.|$|E
5000|$|The Ground Crew Project is a UFO {{religion}} {{begun in}} the 1980s and based in California and Hawaii which later split into the Ground Crew and the Planetary Activation Organisation. [...] It was founded in California by Sheldan <b>Nidle</b> who began to post it online in 1996, and is now an online religion. [...] It is an optimistic religious ufology that believes the Earth {{is on the verge}} of a cosmic transformation which was expected to happen as the Earth apparently made its passage through the high energy properties of a ‘photon belt’ in the 1990s. The religion’s aim is to prepare humanity for large-scale, first contact between Earth and the “Galactic Federation”, claimed to be an extraterrestrial organisation which will help in the supposed transformation. [...] Members of the group are being prepared to play key roles as intermediaries between the claimed extraterrestrials and the population of Earth. [...] After failed predictions, the contact is now believed to happen “as soon as possible” and the ground crew are to actively help in ‘raising’ mankind beforehand.|$|E
50|$|In {{his passion}} for music and selfless {{contribution}} {{to the growth of}} Carnatic music, Vittal Ramamurthy and family organize summer camps in his native home, 'KARUNBITHIL', <b>Nidle</b> Dharmasthala in Karnataka every year. About 250 children from surrounding villages attend this camp which is {{in the style of the}} Gurukulam system. They stay in his house and learn music for a whole week and share it with all their friends. Boarding, lodging and all expenses are borne by Vittal Rammamurthy's family. Eminent artistes are invited to give workshops and concerts to these young musicians. Artistes like Dr. Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna, Umayalpuram K. Sivaraman, M. Chandrasekaran, Vellore G. Ramabhadran, Kamalakara Rao, Neyveli Santhanagopalan, Lalgudi Krishnan, Vijay Siva, T. M. Krishna, Bombay Jayashri, S. Sowmya, Abhishek Raghuram, R. K. Shriramkumar, Embar Kannan, Kalyani Sharma, S.P. Ramh, Sankari Krishnan and others have graced the shibira and motivated the students by their teachings. Every year this is the most awaited musical event by all students and rasikas alike. Students flock to this village for the music camp from not only Karnataka and Chennai, but also as far as New Jersey, Texas and California.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Ascended Master Teachings teacher Sheldan <b>Nidle,</b> who {{resides in}} the gold country {{in the foothills of}} the Sierra Nevada in California, the Earth base of the Ashtar Galactic Command is known as the New Jerusalem or [...] "Shan Chea". It is a square {{rotating}} space station with artificial gravity in constant orbit around Earth on the etheric plane, with orbit distances varying from approximately 500 mi to 1500 mi. It is a large space station with a population of thousands of etheric beings. In the center of this square space station is a sphere connected by four tubes to the square outer ring of the space station. This sphere houses the Inn of Heaven, the command headquarters of Sananda, Lady Master Athena, and Ashtar. There is also a smaller round space station called [...] "Schare" [...] or [...] "Share", where the individual flying saucers of the fleet piloted by those at the higher levels of the fleet command hierarchy dock to receive their orders and review their missions. Within the Inn of Heaven is a private retreat for Sananda (the Master Jesus) in addition to his retreat above Jerusalem. The Master Jesus has a landing pad for his flying saucer at his Jerusalem retreat.|$|E
