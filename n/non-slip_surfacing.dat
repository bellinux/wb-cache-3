50|$|The suribachi is a pottery bowl, glazed on {{the outside}} and with a rough pattern called kushi-no-me on the {{unglazed}} inside. This surface is somewhat similar {{to the surface of the}} oroshigane (grater). The surikogi pestle is made from wood to avoid excessive wear on the suribachi. Traditionally, the wood from the sanshō tree (Japanese prickly ash) was used, which adds a slight flavor to the food, although nowadays other woods are more common. The bowls have a diameter from 10 cm to 30 cm. To use the suribachi the bowl is set on a <b>non-slip</b> <b>surface,</b> such as a rubber mat or a damp towel, and the surikogi is used to grind the material. Recently, plastic versions of the suribachi have also become popular, but they have a much shorter lifespan.|$|R

The effects of two microfillers parametres were investigated: the density, comparing the distribution in the cured resin of hollow microspheres with that of filled spheres, and the wettability, by treating the beads with 3 -aminopropyl-trimethoxy-silane to ensure good adhesion to the matrix and octadecyl-trimethoxy-silane, which, instead, makes them incompatible with it. The morphology of these specimens was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The chemical characterization of the microparticles, and the loaded resin was performed by FT-IR / ATR and by X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), the latter has been especially useful for surface mapping.

40|$|AbstractSevere {{downslope}} windstorm {{occurred during}} January 11 and 12, 1972 when the observed {{wind in the}} upstream region changed little, a surge of warmer air moved across the northwestern US at 500 hPa, accompanied by rapid pressure falls and strong surface cyclogenesis {{in the lee of}} the Rocky Mountains triggered the downslope windstorm. Here, the observed soundings in the upstream are used at inflow. On a <b>non-slip</b> <b>surface</b> without the effect of rotation, the simulated downslope wind decreases with time after 2 – 3 h. If the wind at inflow is in geostrophic balance, the simulated westerly wind at z~ 25 m remains around 33 – 35 ms− 1. If the northwesterly upper-level-jet is unbalanced by large scale pressure gradient, the inertial oscillation decreases the westerly wind and increases the northerly wind of the upper-level-jet as it approaches mountain. Convergence forms in the upper layer and forces more air to descend and results in a severe, long-lasting downslope windstorm as observed. Meanwhile, an unbalanced upper-level-southwesterly-jet decreases the downslope wind. The simulated severe downslope wind, reversed flow atop, and hydraulic jump occur simultaneously, accompanied by waves, rotors and turbulences in the upper layers and the lee side...|$|R
40|$|For applied {{aerodynamic}} computations using {{a general}} purpose Navier-Stokes code, the common practice of treating {{laminar to turbulent}} flow transition over a <b>non-slip</b> <b>surface</b> is somewhat arbitrary by either treating the entire flow as turbulent or forcing the flow to undergo transition at given trip locations in the computational domain. In this study, {{the possibility of using}} the PAB 3 D code, standard k-epsilon turbulence model, and the Girimaji explicit algebraic stresses model to mimic natural laminar to turbulent flow transition was explored. The sensitivity of flow transition with respect to two limiters in the standard k-epsilon turbulence model was examined using a flat plate and a 6 : 1 aspect ratio prolate spheroid for our computations. For the flat plate, a systematic dependence of transition Reynolds number on background turbulence intensity was found. For the prolate spheroid, the transition patterns in the three-dimensional boundary layer at different flow conditions were sensitive to the free stream turbulence viscosity limit, the reference Reynolds number and the angle of attack, but not to background turbulence intensity below a certain threshold value. The computed results showed encouraging agreements with the experimental measurements at the corresponding geometry and flow conditions...|$|R

Currently, the guidelines available only suggest the use of ramps with a slope below 20 degrees to load and unload pigs. However, the total time it takes to load and unload animals and slips, falls, and vocalizations are a welfare concern. Three ramp angles (0, 10 or 20 degrees), five bedding materials (nothing, sand, feed, wood shavings or wheat straw hay), two moistures (dry or wet bedding, > 50 % moisture) over two seasons (> 23. 9 °C summer, < 23. 9 °C winter) were assessed for slips/falls/vocalizations (n = 2400 pig observations) and analyzed with a scoring system. The use of bedding during summer or winter played a role in the total time it took to load and unload the ramp (p < 0. 05). Bedding, bedding moisture, season, and slope significantly interacted to impact the total time to load and unload finishing pigs (p < 0. 05). Heart rate and the total time it took to load and unload the ramp increased as the slope of the ramp increased (p < 0. 05). Heart rates were higher during the summer than winter, and summer heart rates increased as the slope increased (p < 0. 05).

40|$|A {{diversity}} {{of animals that}} run on solid, level, flat, <b>non-slip</b> <b>surfaces</b> appear to bounce on their legs; elastic elements in the limbs can store and return energy during each step. The mechanics and energetics of running in natural terrain, particularly on surfaces that can yield and flow under stress, is less understood. The zebra-tailed lizard (Callisaurus draconoides), a small desert generalist with a large, elongate, tendinous hind foot, runs rapidly {{across a variety of}} natural substrates. We use high speed video to obtain detailed three-dimensional running kinematics on solid and granular surfaces to reveal how leg, foot, and substrate mechanics contribute to its high locomotor performance. Running at ~ 10 body length/s (~ 1 m/s), the center of mass oscillates like a spring-mass system on both substrates, with only 15 % reduction in stride length on the granular surface. On the solid surface, a strut-spring model of the hind limb reveals that the hind foot saves about 40 % of the mechanical work needed per step, significant for the lizard's small size. On the granular surface, a penetration force model and hypothesized subsurface foot rotation indicates that the hind foot paddles through fluidized granular medium, and that the energy lost per step during irreversible deformation of the substrate does not differ from the reduction in the mechanical energy of the center of mass. The upper hind leg muscles must perform three times as much mechanical work on the granular surface as on the solid surface to compensate for the greater energy lost within the foot and to the substrate...|$|R
40|$|The lobbies {{of hotels}} and banks, airport {{terminals}} and rail stations are often elegantly paved with polished natural stone, such as granite. While making a pleasant sight, glossy stone floors may become slippery when wet and dirt are brought in on peoples shoes. To prevent people slipping and injuring themselves, the natural stone floors of public buildings {{need to have}} a non-slip finish. The Fraunhofer Institute for Material and Beam Technology IWS in Dresden have developed a laser process for this purpose, which does not deteriorate the gloss and color intensity to the tiled floor. Conventionally, polished stone floors are provided with a non-slip or anti-skid finish by a form of suction pads, increasing the friction between shoe soles and the floor. The laser process produces the same effect, but is environmentally harmless and not affected by external influences. The pulsed laser beam is guided by two scanner mirrors and a special optical co nfiguration, allowing the treatment to proceed at extremely high speed and with exceptional precision. The machine carves 8, 000 to 10, 000 micro-craters per second into the stone slabs. Different degrees of non-slip effect can be achieved by varying the dimensions of the indentations and the distance between them. Depending on the safety each 0. 3 to 0. 5 millimeters apart. Despite the roughened surface, cleaning the floor is just as easy as before. The process was successfully tested in 1997 with a stationary pilot device. Since last year, it works on an industrial scale, applying the non-slip finish to stone slabs in the production line of a factory. Until recently, existing floors could only be given the conventional chemical treatment but now the available prototype mobile device can provide the <b>non-slip</b> <b>surface</b> finish in situ...|$|R
