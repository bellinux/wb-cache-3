Additionally, most nonprofessional phagocytes do <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> reactive oxygen-containing molecules in response to phagocytosis.|$|E

Strombolian eruptions are noisier, produce no {{sustained}} eruptive columns, do <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> some volcanic products associated with Hawaiian volcanism (specifically Pele's tears and Pele's hair), and produce fewer molten lava flows (although the eruptive material does tend to form small rivulets).|$|E

5|$|A {{chemical}} tracer is 24-isopropylcholestane, {{which is a}} stable derivative of 24-isopropylcholesterol, which {{is said to be}} produced by demosponges but not by eumetazoans ("true animals", i.e. cnidarians and bilaterians). Since choanoflagellates are thought to be animals' closest single-celled relatives, a team of scientists examined the biochemistry and genes of one choanoflagellate species. They concluded that this species could <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> 24-isopropylcholesterol but that investigation of a wider range of choanoflagellates would be necessary in order to prove that the fossil 24-isopropylcholestane could only have been produced by demosponges.|$|E
5|$|According to Confucian teachings, upper-class men honored their {{ancestors}} through rituals carried {{out over the}} course of their lives. These rituals were passed down through generations from father to son. Official family lists were inscribed, with women only acknowledged on that of their marital families.

The first was Eighth Wonder, underwritten by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, which did <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> any games before it closed. After Martin Hollis left Rare, he joined Nintendo before founding his own company Zoonami, releasing Zendoku, Go! Puzzle and Bonsai Barber. Other Perfect Dark team members, including David Doak and Steve Ellis, founded Free Radical Design and created the TimeSplitters series. It was acquired by Crytek and renamed Crytek UK before its 2014 closure, with most of its staff moving to Deep Silver Dambuster Studios.|$|E
5|$|Background {{selection}} {{is the opposite}} of a selective sweep. If a specific site experiences strong and persistent purifying selection, linked variation tends to be weeded out along with it, producing a region in the genome of low overall variability. Because background {{selection is}} a result of deleterious new mutations, which can occur randomly in any haplotype, it does <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> clear blocks of linkage disequilibrium, although with low recombination it can still lead to slightly negative linkage disequilibrium overall.|$|E
5|$|Chesma (Russian: Чесма, {{sometimes}} transliterated as Tchesma) was {{the second}} ship of the s built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1880s. When the ship was completed she proved to be very overweight which meant that much of her waterline armor belt was submerged. Russian companies could <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> the most advanced armour and machinery desired by the Naval General Staff, so they were imported from the United Kingdom and Belgium.

5|$|Current {{limitations}} to p-doping limit electronic and optoelectronic applications of ZnO, which usually require junctions of n-type and p-type material. Known p-type dopants include group-I elements Li, Na, K; group-V elements N, P and As; {{as well as}} copper and silver. However, many of these form deep acceptors and do <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> significant p-type conduction at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|During 1836–37, Otto visited Germany, {{marrying a}} {{beautiful}} and talented 17-year-old, Duchess Amalia (Amelie) of Oldenburg (21 December 1818 to 20 May 1875). The wedding took place not in Greece, but in Oldenburg, on 22 November 1836; the marriage did <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> an heir, and the new queen made herself unpopular by interfering in the government and maintaining her Lutheran faith. Otto was unfaithful to his wife, and had a liaison with Jane Digby, a notorious woman his father had previously taken as a lover.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the Cyberpunk album, Billy Idol did <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> another {{original}} album until 2005, 13 years later.

With the founding of Sanctuary Records, an independent record label Idol felt positive about, and the formation of a new band with Steve Stevens, Idol decided to produce Devil's Playground. Idol's later album featured a more power pop and classic rock sound similar to Idol's 80s style, and received middling reviews.|$|E
