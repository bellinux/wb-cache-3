And yet I wish a <b>notarial</b> <b>seal,</b> or {{a description of}} the person, had accompanied the letters. This is the signature of Robert Tweed; I know it well, and would be glad to see it {{at the bottom of a}} promissory note for ten thousand pounds; that is, with a responsible endorser; but the uncertainty is much against your pecuniary interest, young man, since we become, as it were, underwriters that you are the individual named." ...|$|E

5000|$|Pennsylvania notaries {{are governed}} by Title 57 of the Pennsylvania Statutes, known as the Notary Public Law. Act 151 of 2002 amended Title 57, {{bringing}} about the most significant changes to the Notary Public Law in 50 years. In effect since July 1, 2003, these changes include required education for notaries, specific signer identification procedures, eligibility of nonresidents to hold notarial commission, embossing seal no longer required on notarized documents, and authorization for electronic notarization. As {{a result of the}} repeal of the embosser requirement the wording [...] "Commonwealth of Pennsylvania" [...] is recommended to be clearly written or typed along the top border of the Notary Public's <b>notarial</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A {{notary seal}} of the rubber stamp type is {{required}} to be affixed to all notarized paper documents. The rubber stamp must include the commissioned name of the notary public, the words [...] "Notary Public-State of Florida", the notary's commission number, and the date on which the notary's commission expires. Prior to the mid-1970s, the only statutory requirement regarding <b>notarial</b> <b>seals</b> was that one be used and that it include the words [...] "Notary Public" [...] and [...] "State of Florida at Large"; {{the name of the}} notary was optional, and the law did not specify what types of seals were permissible. This law was later amended to state that the seal must be round in design and of either the rubber stamp or impression type. In the early 1990s, the statute was again changed to require a rubber stamp seal, with an impression type seal being optional and not acceptable unless used in conjunction with a rubber stamp. However, many notaries continue to use the impression seal with their rubber stamp to allow for easy detection when trying to determine which document is an original. This process is made more difficult for notaries who only use a rubber stamp seal, as the Florida statutes require that the seal be affixed in only photographically-reproducible black ink.|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, wax seals {{were never}} {{expressly}} required. The Restatement of Contracts (Second) notes that Impressions {{directly on the}} paper were recognized early and are still common for <b>notarial</b> and corporate <b>seals,</b> and gummed paper wafers have been widely used. In the absence of statute, decisions have divided {{on the effectiveness of}} the written or printed word 'seal', the printed initials 'L.S.' ..., a scrawl made with a pen (often called a 'scroll') and a recital of sealing. The relaxation of the definition of a seal was generally contemporaneous with reduced distinctions given to sealed contracts. This trend {{can be seen as a}} parallel of the courts' modern relaxation of their interpretation of the Statute of Frauds, and reflects the evolution of modern contract theory from classical contract theory. It has been noted that [...] "about two-thirds of the US states have now adopted statutory provisions depriving the seal of its binding effect," [...] although several important jurisdictions, such as New Jersey and Wisconsin, have retained the concept. Schnell v. Nell (1861), which is widely cited as an example of nominal consideration, involved a sealed contract. Although the distinction of seal had already been abolished by Indiana statute, it is likely the parties viewed the seal as making the contract enforceable, much as the nominal consideration of $1 would have under classical contract theory.|$|R
