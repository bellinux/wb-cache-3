40|$|Motivated by {{the work}} of Klebanov and Polyakov [hep-th/ 0210114] on the {{relationship}} of the large N O(N) vector model in three-dimensions to AdS_ 4 and higher spin representations, we attempt to find analogous connections for AdS_ 5. Since the usual O(N) vector model in four-dimensions is inconsistent, we consider the (consistent) large <b>N</b> <b>gauged</b> vector model and a N= 1 supersymmetric analogue in four-dimensions. Both these theories have UV and IR fixed points, and are candidates for a (α') ^- 1 expansion in AdS_ 5, a conjectured AdS_ 5 /CFT correspondence and higher-spin representations in the bulk theory.

Nn18 layouts use T scale track and mechanisms to represent minimum gauge railways. N scale trains and structures are often used on HO or larger layouts to create forced perspective, or the illusion that an object is further away than it actually is.|$|E

40|$|We obtain new {{results for}} {{consistent}} braneworld Kaluza-Klein reductions, showing {{how we can}} derive four-dimensional <b>N</b> = 2 <b>gauged</b> supergravity “localised on the AdS 4 brane” as an exact embedding in five-dimensional <b>N</b> = 4 <b>gauged</b> supergravity. Similarly, we obtain five-dimensional <b>N</b> = 2 <b>gauged</b> supergravity localised on an AdS 5 brane as a consistent Kaluza-Klein reduction from six-dimensional <b>N</b> = 4 <b>gauged</b> supergravity. These embeddings can be lifted to type IIB and massive type IIA supergravity respectively. The new AdS braneworld Kaluza-Klein reductions are generalisations of earlier results on braneworld reductions to ungauged supergravities. The lower-dimensional cosmological constant in our AdS braneworld reductions is an adjustable parameter, and {{so it can be}} chosen to be small enough to be phenomenologically realistic, even if the higher-dimensional one is of Planck scale. We also discuss analytic continuations to give a de Sitter gauged supergravity in four dimensions as a braneworld Kaluza-Klein reduction. We find that there are two distinct routes that lead to the same four-dimensional theory.
