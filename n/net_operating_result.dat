40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedMBA Professional ReportOver {{the past four}} years, Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Washington has encountered <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>result</b> (NOR) losses not anticipated in the Navy Working Capital Fund (NWCF) budget. These unanticipated losses primarily stemmed from three major factors associated with financial operations. The first factor {{is the creation of}} stabilized rates {{that turned out to be}} insufficient during fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008. The second factor is the disparity between the budgeted and actual average labor hours worked. The third factor is the continued rising cost of purchased utility commodities in support of the services rendered to the customers, coupled with the inadequate revenues generated from utilities services performed. This MBA research project uses the labor and budget information provided by the command to assist them: (1) determining the financial impacts due to inaccurate projected labor hours, (2) evaluating the current policy concerning stabilized rates, (3) mitigating the impact associated with the rising cost of purchased utilities, and (4) developing an improved model for estimating future expenses and revenues...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis explains the current process involved in establishing stabilized {{rates for the}} Naval Aviation Depot (NADEP) Cherry Point, North Carolina. Existing data were examined to aid in understanding the process for determining stabilized rates, workload standards, and workload allocation. Additionally, this research provides {{an analysis of the}} inputs to the rate setting process to determine which has the most influence on the financial operating result. A general history of working capital funds is provided and an explanation of the financial and management goals of the Navy Working Capital Fund are spelled out. An assessment of existing methods was based on variance analysis between projected results and actual results. The variance analysis suggests that the current methods used for determining workload standards consistently underestimate the number of hours required to complete the work. Finally a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine which input variable has the most influence on the <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>result.</b> The sensitivity analysis suggests that changes to workload norms have the most influence on the bottom line at the NADEP.

40|$|Strategic {{planning}} and management {{was introduced in the}} public sector more than three decades ago and has become a core component in many new public management reforms.

40|$|MBA Professional ReportFor six of {{the past}} eight years, naval {{aviation}} depot-level maintenances activities have encountered operating losses that were not anticipated in the Navy Working Capital Fund (NWCF) budgets. These unanticipated losses resulted in increases or surcharges to the stabilized rates as an offset. This project conducts a variance analysis to uncover possible causes of the unanticipated losses. The variance analysis between budgeted (projected) and actual financial results was performed on financial data collected on the E- 2 C aircraft program from Fleet Readiness Center Southwest (FRCSW) located in San Diego, California. The results of the variance analysis are interpreted and {{discussed in terms of}} labor sales quantity, mix, and rate variances, material sales variance, material expense variance, labor, production overhead, and general and administrative rate/spending and quantity variances. The results of this project reveal the factors that created the greatest variance in FRCSW's <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>results.</b> The variance analysis suggests that the factors having the greatest affect on the <b>operating</b> <b>results</b> were the material sales variances, material expense variances, and the variances due to the quantity of work. Additionally, the analysis revealed that during the year analyzed (FY 2007) FRCSW was not reimbursed for 21 percent of its material costs...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Doctoral (Human Resource Management)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2005 The {{image of}} the Western Cape Education Department (WCED) is {{influenced}} by its ability to handle {{and to develop a}} system whereby not only will the perceived gap between the expectation and satisfaction of the customers be closed, but the customer will also be able to derive value from the services rendered. In order for this to come to fruition, as well as the fact that the employees know the true picture of the flow of work within the WCED, it is crucial that the employees be involved in the mapping of the strategy, which in turn would be utilised to attain the vision. A key challenge is getting all the parts of the WCED in line with its strategies, which in turn impacts on the mission and vision. Maximum value requires an understanding of its creation and a proactive approach. These are not easily accomplished. Not only is the "education industry" presently confronted with many changes, its stakeholders and customers are making greater demands. As a result of this. the WCED needs to be more efficient, but importantly also {{to be aware of the}} "efficiency trap". A decrease in the <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>result</b> of the WCED would result in dissatisfied customers. In order for this not to be an option. the synergy of the balanced scorecard and the whole value chain within a lean environment should be considered as the reduction of occupational crime i. e. human activity absorbing resources, but not creating value or nonvalue creating / adding activities or muda has become a priority. Also by focussing on an occupational crime reduction flow of work, the WCED will be seen as a system of processes and not as a system of separate functions...|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{significant}} dollar savings to the Army and U. S. taxpayers, Letterkenny Army Depot received widespread public recognition in 2005. The depot received a public sector Shingo Prize for applying Lean principles and tools to its PATRIOT missile system recapitalization program. While Letterkenny was Leaning its production systems, the depot implemented two innovative and effective financial incentive systems: one to reward employees, the other to reward customers. The reward systems were innovative because they occurred in a not-for-profit organization and effective because they motivated customers, employees, and unions to embrace Lean. First, the commander of Letterkenny Army Depot introduced a mechanism for immediately recognizing surplus <b>Net</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Results</b> (“NOR”) funds generated by Lean savings. Rather than following prescribed budgeting procedures, Letterkenny made sixty percent of auditable surplus NOR available to customers within the current fiscal year. With Lean savings immediately put “back in customers’ hands”, the customers usually chose to repurchase Letterkenny services with their Lean savings checks. The additional services performed by the depot at essentially no cost to the customer provided combat-ready weapon systems to the Warfighter, {{over and above the}} quantities planned for the current fiscal year. The depot reinvested the balance of its NOR surpluses in improvements to its facilities and equipment, helping to promote Lean buy-in among civilian employees and their unions. Second, Letterkenny negotiated a revised process for awarding NOR-related bonus checks to its employees. To further promote Lean buy-in, the depot established a “threshold” approach to determine the size of the employee payments. Letterkenny awarded payouts of $ 200 /employee for each $ 1 million increase in NOR, up to a maximum of $ 5 million. By reaching annual Lean-enabled NOR of at least $ 5 million each year, Letterkenny employees could and did receive annual bonus checks of $ 1, 000 in three successive years. The case describes the organizational conditions leading to these innovations and the responses to them among its customers, unions and headquarters...|$|R

40|$|After {{several years}} of {{increasing}} pension expenses in the municipalities of Norway, a regulatory change was introduced in 2002 to equalize these expenses. With this change a new concept of pension accounting arose that caused a deviation, which can be explained briefly as {{the difference between the}} net pension expense and the contributed pension premium. Municipalities were given the option to amortize this deviation over either 1 year or 15 years. The municipality of Haugesund, like most, chose the second option. This study examines Haugesund's annual accounts and balance sheets for the years 2002 - 2016, to evaluate the consequences of this regulatory change on the municipality's financial performance. We used both qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection, analysis and interpretation. The data that form the basis for our conclusion are derived from interviews, annual accounts, and pension notes associated with Haugesund municipality. Our results show that the introduction of this deviation, and the option to amortize this deviation over several years, positively affected the municipality's <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> profit. The <b>results</b> also show that amortization of this deviation over one year would have given the municipality a weaker result...|$|R

40|$|When {{cumulative}} <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> income (accounting value added) outstrips cumulative free {{cash flow}} (cash value added), subsequent earnings growth is weak.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the {{financial}} performance of retail firms with fiscal years ending on or around December 31, 2008 and 2009 (the recession years) with retail firms with fiscal years ending on or around December 31, 2006 and 2007 (the non-recession years). As with Little, Little, and Coffee (2008), the modified Du Pont model of financial ratio analysis is used to identify the drivers of financial success under alternative business strategies. Firms in the retail industry are categorized according to their high/low relative <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> income to sales and operating asset turnover ratios. Firms with high relative <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> income to sales and low relative operating asset turnover are assumed to be pursuing a differentiation strategy and those with high relative operating asset turnover and low relative <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> income to sales are assumed to be pursuing a cost leadership strategy. The performance variable used is return on <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> assets. One stream of prior research suggests that a firm could, in theory, perform well following either strategy. Little, Little, and Coffee (2008) suggest that retail firms using a differentiator strategy outperform (based on return on <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> assets) those using a cost leader strategy. However, the findings of this research suggest that retail firms pursuing a differentiation strategy are not more likely to achieve a higher return on <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> assets than those firms pursuing a cost leadership strategy in a recessionary period...|$|R
