5|$|Some rulers {{handled this}} {{arrangement}} with less subtlety than others. Domitian {{was not so}} subtle. From the outset of his reign, he stressed the reality of his autocracy. He disliked aristocrats and had <b>no</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> showing it, withdrawing every decision-making power from the Senate, and instead relying on a small set of friends and equestrians to control the important offices of state.|$|E
5|$|His {{capital is}} {{believed}} to be somewhere in modern-day Haryana. Prithu used his Kshatriya power to make the earth yield its riches. Hence the earth is called Prithvi, daughter of Prithu. Prithu, by mere fiat of will, created millions of men, elephants, chariots and horses. During his reign, there was no decreptitude, no calamity, no famine, no disease, no agriculture and no mining. Prithu enjoyed popularity amongst his subjects, hence all kings are called Rajas. Cows yielded buckets of rich milk when they were touched. Trees and lotuses always had honey in them. People were healthy and happy and had <b>no</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> thieves or wild animals. Nobody died of accidents. Kusha grass was golden in colour. Fruits were always sweet and ripe and nobody went hungry. People lived in houses or caves or trees or wherever they liked. For the first time, civilization and commerce came into existence.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to serving as social cues {{between members of}} the same species, Mups can act as kairomones—chemical signals that transmit information between species. Mice are instinctively afraid of the smell of their natural predators, including cats and rats. This occurs even in laboratory mice that have been isolated from predators for hundreds of generations. When the chemical cues responsible for the fear response were purified from cat saliva and rat urine, two homologous protein signals were identified: Feld4 (Felis domesticus allergen 4), the product of the cat Mup gene, and Ratn1 (Rattus norvegicus allergen 1), the product of the rat Mup13 gene. Mice are fearful of these Mups even when they are made in bacteria, but mutant animals that are unable to detect the Mups showed <b>no</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> rats, demonstrating their importance in initiating fearful behaviour. It is not known exactly how Mups from different species initiate disparate behaviours, but mouse Mups and predator Mups have been shown to activate unique patterns of sensory neurons in the nose of recipient mice. This implies the mouse perceives them differently, via distinct neural circuits. The pheromone receptors responsible for Mup detection are also unknown, though they are thought be members of the V2R receptor class.|$|E

25|$|With all of Humayun's {{brothers}} now dead, {{there was}} <b>no</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> another usurping his throne during his military campaigns. He was also now an established leader and could trust his generals. With this new-found strength Humayun {{embarked on a}} series of military campaigns aimed at extending his reign over areas in eastern and western India. His sojourn in exile seems to have reduced his reliance on astrology, and his military leadership came to imitate the more effective methods that he had observed in Persia.|$|E

25|$|Hanafi: The Hanafi {{school does}} not {{consider}} a woman's face to be awrah; however it is still obligatory (wajib) {{for a woman to}} cover her face. While the Hanafi school has not completely forbidden a male's gaze towards a female's face when there exists absolutely <b>no</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> attraction, the woman has no way of knowing whether the gazes directed towards her are free of desire or not, especially when she is out in public. The Hanafi school has thus obliged women to cover their faces in front of strangers.|$|E

The father, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes {{it upon himself to}} treat her personally with psychotherapy. But it is not successful, and so when she reveals that her second greatest fear is nature, he decides to try exposure therapy. They hike to their isolated cabin in a woods called Eden, where she spent time with Nic the previous summer while writing a thesis on gynocide.

25|$|Some {{classical}} and modern scholars have analyzed Abraham's reasoning for hiding Sarah's position as his wife. Rashi argued {{that when a}} stranger comes to town, the proper thing {{to do would be}} to inquire if he needs food and drink, not whether his female companion is a married woman, and hence as Abimelech did the latter, it tipped off Abraham {{to the fact that there}} is <b>no</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> God in this place, and so he lied about his relationship with Sarah in order to avoid being killed. Christian interpretation of the incidents has varied considerably. Some commentators have seen them as regrettable exceptions in the lives of those who otherwise lived upright lives, comparable to Noah's and Lot's drunkenness and David's adultery.|$|E
25|$|Peter Coni, who {{was elected}} as Chairman of the regatta’s Committee of Management in 1978, was {{supportive}} {{of the idea of}} introducing women's events. However, he had had little time to take any action when there was an attempt to force the issue. Kingston Rowing Club sent in an entry for the Double Sculls Challenge Cup in the names of A.Hohl and P.Bird. The crew was in fact Great Britain internationals Astrid Ayling and Pauline Hart, who had made the entry under their maiden names. The regatta realised the subterfuge and Coni made a statement to the press in which he said that it was 'sad that a long-established club should think it reasonable behaviour to make a deliberately false declaration'. He added that the stewards had <b>no</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> the Sex Discrimination Act.|$|E
25|$|The ship or wharf rat {{has contributed}} to the {{extinction}} of many species of wildlife including birds, small mammals, reptiles, invertebrates, and plants, especially on islands. True rats are omnivorous and capable of eating a wide range of plant and animal foods. True rats have a very high birth rate. When introduced to a new area, they quickly reproduce {{to take advantage of the}} new food supply. In particular, they prey on the eggs and young of forest birds, which on isolated islands often have no other predators and thus have <b>no</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> predators. Some experts believe that rats are to blame for between 40 percent and 60 percent of all seabird and reptile extinctions, with 90 percent of those occurring on islands. Thus man has indirectly caused the extinction of many species by accidentally introducing rats to new areas.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the anti-war movement, the U.S. Congress passed the Case–Church Amendment to prohibit further U.S. military intervention in Vietnam in June 1973 and reduced aid to South Vietnam in August 1974. With U.S. bombing ended, communist logistical preparations could be accelerated. An oil pipeline was built from North Vietnam to Việt Cộng headquarters in Lộc Ninh, about 75 miles northwest of Saigon. (COSVN was moved back to South Vietnam following the Easter Offensive.) The Ho Chi Minh Trail, beginning {{as a series of}} treacherous mountain tracks {{at the start of the}} war, was upgraded throughout the war, first into a road network driveable by trucks in the dry season, and finally, into paved, all-weather roads that could be used year-round, even during the monsoon. Between the beginning of 1974 and April 1975, with now-excellent roads and <b>no</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> air interdiction, the communists delivered nearly 365,000 tons of war matériel to battlefields, 2.6 times the total for the previous 13 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} in {{records are}} those {{represented in the}} paintings of the Egyptian tombs, {{in which they are}} shown as single or double doors, each in a single piece of wood. Doors were once believed to be the literal doorway to the afterlife, and some doors leading to important places included designs of the afterlife. In Egypt, where the climate is intensely dry, there would be <b>no</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> their warping, but in other countries it would be necessary to frame them, which according to Vitruvius (iv. 6.) was done with stiles (sea/si) and rails (see: Frame and panel): the spaces enclosed being filled with panels (tympana) let into grooves made in the stiles and rails. The stiles were the vertical boards, one of which, tenoned or hinged, is known as the hanging stile, the other as the middle or meeting stile. The horizontal cross pieces are the top rail, bottom rail, and middle or intermediate rails. The most ancient doors were made timber, such as those referred to in the Biblical depiction of King Solomon's temple being in olive wood (I Kings vi. 31-35), which were carved and overlaid with gold. The doors dwelt upon in Homer would appear to have been cased in silver or brass. Besides olive wood, elm, cedar, oak and cypress were used. A 5,000-year-old door has been found by archaeologists in Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|Bears {{are said}} by a source to be {{generally}} afraid of tigers, and changed their path after coming across tiger trails; however, this is disputed. In the winters of 1970–1973, Yudakov and Nikolaev recorded two cases of bears showing <b>no</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> tigers and {{another case of}} a brown bear changing path upon crossing tiger tracks. Other researchers have observed bears following tiger tracks to scavenge tiger kills and to potentially prey on tigers. Despite the threat of predation, some brown bears actually benefit from the presence of tigers by appropriating tiger kills that the bears {{may not be able}} to successfully hunt themselves. Brown bears generally prefer to contest the much smaller female tigers. During telemetry research in the Sikhote-Alin protected area, 44 direct confrontations between bears and tigers were observed, in which bears in general were killed in 22 cases, and tigers in 12 cases. There are reports of brown bears specifically targeting Amur leopards and tigers to abstract their prey. In the Sikhote-Alin reserve, 35% of tiger kills were stolen by bears, with tigers either departing entirely or leaving part of the kill for the bear. Some studies show that bears frequently track down tigers to usurp their kills, with occasional fatal outcomes for the tiger. A report from 1973 describes twelve known cases of brown bears killing tigers, including adult males; in all cases the tigers were subsequently eaten by the bears.|$|E

25|$|Although {{they had}} won the 1947–48 Sheffield Shield Western Australia were its weakest team (Tasmania was not yet included) and {{isolated}} {{from the rest of}} Australia, so they provided an easy start for the MCC's round of state matches. The WACA Ground would not see a Test match until the 1970-71 Ashes series, so this was the only occasion for the Perth crowd to see a Test team in action. Freddie Brown won the toss and elected to bat, only to see his openers Reg Simpson and David Sheppard out for 5 runs, surprised by the swing they had been told was rare in Australia. Gilbert Parkhouse was bowled at 25/3 and it took Denis Compton (106) and John Dewes (94) to restore the innings with a partnership of 183. The vice-captain was particularity pleased with his century as it silenced the critics who thought him unfit to play and he managed to run between the wickets and step out to drive the bowlers without any fuss. Brian Close made an unbeaten 108, his maiden first-class century, although he almost walked on 91 before he found that what he had thought was a catch had taken the ball over the boundary. Godfrey Evans (43) and Alec Bedser (42) helped him hit the ball around and Brown declared on 434/9. Doug Wright proved to have one of his more productive days, but his 7/60 failed to enforce the follow on by two runs as Western Australia reached 236 thanks to their captain Doug Carmody (59) and Chris Langdon (60). The MCC hustled up 121/3 in 124 minutes before Brown declared again and set the home team 320 to win in under three hours. Bedser was confined to bed with influenza and there was <b>no</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> a result as Western Australia made 207/4 with Tom Outridge belting 3 sixes and 9 fours in his 92 with Close suffering 3/81 off 13 overs. This was the youngster's first proper bowl and it badly affected him and destroyed his confidence to bowl on Australian pitches where he could get little movement with the ball, to the point that Brown reserved him for the country matches after the Second Test. A disgruntled Gilbert Parkhouse had been shoved into the slip cordon, where he dropped three catches and the MCC's poor fielding soon lead to them being called Brown's Cows by the Australian press.|$|E
