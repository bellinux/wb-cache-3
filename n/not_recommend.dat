5|$|Antidiabetic {{therapy has}} been {{proposed}} {{as a treatment for}} polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition frequently associated with insulin resistance, since the late 1980s. The use of metformin in PCOS was first reported in 1994, in a small study conducted at the University of the Andes, Venezuela. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin for anovulation and infertility when other therapies fail to produce results. However, two clinical studies completed in 2006–2007 returned mostly negative results, with metformin performing no better than placebo, and a metformin-clomifene combination no better than clomifene alone. Reflecting this, subsequent reviews large randomized controlled trials in general have not shown the promise suggested by the early studies. UK and international clinical practice guidelines do <b>not</b> <b>recommend</b> metformin as a first-line treatment or do <b>not</b> <b>recommend</b> it at all, except for women with glucose intolerance. The guidelines suggest clomiphene as the first medication option and emphasize lifestyle modification independently from the drug treatment.|$|E
5|$|For a given discipline, {{not more}} than two sportspersons, one male and one female, are given highest marks. The {{committee}} may <b>not</b> <b>recommend</b> the award to the sportsperson with the highest marks across disciplines but can only recommend {{the recipient of the}} highest aggregate marks in a particular sports discipline. The recommendations of the selection committee are submitted to the Union Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports for further approval.|$|E
5|$|Instead of anticoagulation, a {{follow-up}} imaging test (typically ultrasound) about one-week post-diagnosis {{is an option}} for those with an acute isolated distal DVT without a high risk for extension; if the clot does not grow, the ACCP does <b>not</b> <b>recommend</b> anticoagulation. This technique can benefit those at a high risk for bleeding. Patients may choose anticoagulation over serial imaging, however, to avoid the inconvenience of another scan if concerns {{about the risk of}} bleeding are insignificant. When applied to symptomatic patients with a negative initial ultrasound result, serial testing is inefficient and not cost effective.|$|E

50|$|Pyridostigmine {{decreases}} {{the degradation of}} acetylcholine after release into the synaptic cleft, and thereby improves muscle contraction. An older agent, guanidine, causes many side-effects and is <b>not</b> <b>recommended.</b> 4-Aminopyridine (dalfampridine), an agent related to 3,4-aminopyridine, causes more side-effects than 3,4-DAP and is also <b>not</b> <b>recommended.</b>|$|R

5|$|No {{significant}} difference appears in treatment success rates between linezolid, glycopeptides, or appropriate beta-lactam antibiotics {{in the treatment}} of pneumonia. Clinical guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia developed by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend that linezolid be reserved for cases in which MRSA has been confirmed as the causative organism, or when MRSA infection is suspected based on the clinical presentation. The guidelines of the British Thoracic Society do <b>not</b> <b>recommend</b> it as first-line treatment, but rather as an alternative to vancomycin. Linezolid is also an acceptable second-line treatment for community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia when penicillin resistance is present.|$|E
5|$|The Country Sunrise News {{stated that}} the drama has a fast pace. Mallory Clarkson of the London Community News {{reported}} that, while She Has a Name is an emotional play, there are lighter moments where audience members can laugh. Similarly, Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate asserted that the play's sporadic humorous points maintain the audience's engagement with the story so they do not become numb to the play's emotional pulls. Kooman stated {{that he tried to}} write the play {{in a way that would}} shock audiences without disturbing them to the point that they would <b>not</b> <b>recommend</b> it to friends.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Commission's {{proposal}} led to {{a debate}} between senior officers in the Navy and the Koninklijke Landmacht (Royal Netherlands Army) over how to best protect the NEI, {{and the question of}} how the cost of the ships should be split between the Netherlands and the NEI also was not settled until July 1914. After considering the recommendations, the Dutch Government decided to acquire four battleships, and a bill seeking funding for them was introduced into the Dutch parliament in August 1914. However, this was withdrawn following the outbreak of the First World War that month. A new royal commission into Dutch defense needs held after the war did <b>not</b> <b>recommend</b> that battleships be procured and none were ever ordered.|$|E

5|$|The {{piercing}} gun: The {{vast majority}} {{of women in the}} west have their ears pierced with a piercing gun. The safety of piercing guns, which were originally developed for tagging livestock, has been disputed. The Department of Health of Western Australia does <b>not</b> <b>recommend</b> their use for piercing body parts other than the lobes of ears, and the Association of Professional Piercers recommends that piercing guns not be used for any piercing, requiring members to agree not to use piercing guns in their practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{proceedings}} {{were initiated}} after Oppenheimer refused to voluntarily {{give up his}} security clearance while working as an atomic weapons consultant for the government, under a contract due to expire {{at the end of}} June 1954. Several of his colleagues testified at the hearings. As a result of the two to one decision of the hearing's three judges, he was stripped of his security clearance one day before his consultant contract was due to expire. The panel found that he was loyal and discreet with atomic secrets, but did <b>not</b> <b>recommend</b> that his security clearance be reinstated.|$|E
5|$|A new Royal Commission {{into the}} defense of the Netherlands and NEI was held during 1920 and 1921. This Commission did <b>not</b> <b>recommend</b> that any battleships be constructed; instead it {{proposed}} that all ships under construction as at 31 December be completed along with a further two cruisers, 12 destroyers and 16 submarines. This plan was considered unaffordable, however, especially given the strength of the disarmament movement internationally. A Navy Bill to fund a reduced version of the Royal Commission's proposal was introduced to parliament in November 1921, but was eventually defeated by a single vote in October 1923. Renewed Dutch concerns over Japanese aggression in the late 1930s led to a proposal to build three Design 1047 battlecruisers for service in the NEI, but construction of these ships had not begun when the Netherlands was overrun by German forces in May 1940.|$|E

5|$|After resigning {{from the}} AHC, Darwaza {{spent the rest}} of his life in the modern state of Syria where he left {{politics}} to concentrate on literature. Although he did much of his writing in the 1930s and 1940s, he did not have any of his works published until the 1960s. As a pan-Arab intellectual, Darwaza aided in establishing the union between Syria and Egypt forming the short-lived United Arab Republic. After Egypt adopted its 1956 constitution declaring that it was an Arab country and its people a part of the Arab nation, Darwaza concluded that Egypt and Syria were in a position to unite. When unity negotiations underwent, he suggested several forms of federation, such as the American, Soviet, and Indian models, but did <b>not</b> <b>recommend</b> any specific model for an Arab state. Darwaza did, however, suggest that the institution of a federation between Egypt and Syria would be the first step towards the realization of a comprehensive union.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{discussed}} the possible {{use of nuclear}} weapons in Korea with MacArthur in December, and later asked him for a list of targets in the Soviet Union in case it entered the war. MacArthur testified before the Congress in 1951 that he had never recommended the {{use of nuclear weapons}}. He did at one point consider a plan to cut off North Korea with radioactive poisons; he did <b>not</b> <b>recommend</b> it at the time, although he later broached the matter with Eisenhower, then president-elect, in 1952. In 1954, in an interview published after his death, he stated he had wanted to drop atomic bombs on enemy bases, but in 1960, he challenged a statement by Truman that he had advocated using atomic bombs. Truman issued a retraction, stating that he had no evidence of the claim; it was merely his personal opinion.|$|E
5|$|Guidelines {{issued by}} the UK-based National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), carried out a {{systematic}} review using different methodology {{and came to a}} different conclusion. They questioned the accuracy of studies that were not placebo-controlled. And, based on the findings of placebo-controlled studies, they do <b>not</b> <b>recommend</b> use of benzodiazepines beyond two to four weeks, as tolerance and physical dependence develop rapidly, with withdrawal symptoms including rebound anxiety occurring after six weeks or more of use. Nevertheless, benzodiazepines are still prescribed for long-term treatment of anxiety disorders, although specific antidepressants and psychological therapies are recommended as the first-line treatment options with the anticonvulsant drug pregabalin indicated as a second- or third-line treatment and suitable for long-term use. NICE stated that long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia is an unlicensed indication, does not have long-term efficacy, and is, therefore, not recommended by clinical guidelines. Psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy are recommended as a first-line therapy for panic disorder; benzodiazepine use has been found to interfere with therapeutic gains from these therapies.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 2015 {{wilderness}} designations, the White Cloud and Boulder mountains {{were part}} of the largest unprotected roadless area in the United States outside of Alaska. In the absence of Congressional action that would designate the Boulder-White Clouds region as wilderness, the area had been studied for possible protection as a national monument by presidential proclamation under the Antiquities Act. Former Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne initially studied the area for national monument status, but did <b>not</b> <b>recommend</b> it because Congressional action seemed likely. The 2015 bill passed after receiving increased attention when President Obama indicated he would designate a national monument in the area if the wilderness bill did not pass. Additionally, other large areas of the forest are parts of proposed wilderness areas, such as through the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act. These other proposals have gained no support among Idaho's congressional delegation because the bills could place undue public use and development restrictions on Idaho's public lands.|$|E
5|$|Guest was Minister of Mines and Public Works, from 1 June 1938 to 1 February 1944. The Electricity Supply Commission {{came under}} his portfolio. It had {{responsibility}} for {{ensuring that the}} generation of electricity kept pace with the ever·growing needs of mining, farming and secondary industry. When Guest became Minister the Commission was constructing a thermal power station at Umsweswe, but kept running short of money. The Minister of Finance, Jacob Smit, was reluctant to grant further funds but would support a hydro-electric scheme. Guest proposed Kariba {{as a source of}} hydro-electric power and Smit provided the money for further investigation. Guest arranged with a civil engineer named Jeffares, who had earlier surveyed the route of the proposed Sinoia/Kafue railway and knew the country around Kariba, to survey the area, select a site for a power station and submit a report. When he eventually did so, Guest appointed a committee of engineers to examine the proposal. They reported favourably but did <b>not</b> <b>recommend</b> that the scheme be proceeded with immediately. Nor was the Cabinet particularly impressed, and the idea was strongly criticised by the Opposition in Parliament. The outbreak of the Second World War caused the project to be shelved but after the war the project was revived as a joint scheme to serve the two Rhodesias.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, a tax {{was placed}} on land owned by the proprietors. In {{exchange}} for collecting the tax, the government promised to abandon its attempts to enforce the payment of quitrents. In 1836, a bill was passed to place a penal tax on unoccupied land. Although the Colonial Office initially refused to recommend Royal Assent, comments by Lord Durham led the Privy Council to give Royal Assent to the bill in 1838. Despite the change in property arrangements in Prince Edward Island {{with the introduction of}} these taxes, tenants were still unable to take possession of their land. In 1830, Roman Catholics were given the vote, and in 1838 the Escheat Party won a large majority in the General Assembly. Another bill to implement escheat passed the lower house, but was rejected by the Legislative Council. The leader of the Escheat Party, William Cooper, travelled to London to meet the Colonial Secretary, but he was turned away without a meeting. Instead, the Secretary advised the Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island that the government would <b>not</b> <b>recommend</b> assent to any bill advocating escheat. The Escheat Movement disintegrated.|$|E
