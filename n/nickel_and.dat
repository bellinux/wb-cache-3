5|$|Other {{materials}} are often {{added to the}} iron/carbon mixture to produce steel with desired properties. <b>Nickel</b> <b>and</b> manganese in steel add to its tensile strength and make the austenite form of the iron-carbon solution more stable, chromium increases hardness and melting temperature, and vanadium also increases hardness while making it less prone to metal fatigue.|$|E
5|$|Palladium {{is one of}} {{the three}} most popular {{alloying}} metals in white gold (<b>nickel</b> <b>and</b> silver can also be used). Palladium-gold is more expensive than nickel-gold, but seldom causes allergic reactions (though certain cross-allergies with nickel may occur).|$|E
5|$|Silver-containing brazing alloys {{are used}} for brazing {{metallic}} materials, mostly cobalt, <b>nickel,</b> <b>and</b> copper-based alloys, tool steels, and precious metals.

Silver provides increased workability and corrosion resistance during usage.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a further}} tiny energy gain could be {{extracted}} by synthesizing 62Ni, {{which has a}} marginally higher binding energy than 56Fe, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process. Element production in supernovas and distribution on Earth greatly favor iron over <b>nickel,</b> <b>and</b> in any case, 56Fe still has a lower mass per nucleon than 62Ni due to its higher fraction of lighter protons. Hence, elements heavier than iron require a supernova for their formation, involving rapid neutron capture by starting 56Fe nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{versatility}} of {{the process}} and the simplicity of its equipment and operation, shielded metal arc welding is one of the world's first and most popular welding processes. It dominates other welding processes in the maintenance and repair industry, and though flux-cored arc welding is growing in popularity, SMAW continues to be used extensively in the construction of heavy steel structures and in industrial fabrication. The process is used primarily to weld iron and steels (including stainless steel) but aluminium, <b>nickel</b> <b>and</b> copper alloys can also be welded with this method.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the last}} ice age removed the top {{sediment}} layer of the soil, the Kola Peninsula is on the surface extremely rich in various ores and minerals, including apatites and nephelines; copper, <b>nickel,</b> <b>and</b> iron ores; mica; kyanites; ceramic materials, as well as rare-earth elements and non-ferrous ores. Deposits of construction materials such as granite, quartzite, and limestone are also abundant. Diatomaceous earth deposits are common near lakes and are used to produce insulation.|$|E

30|$|Herein, we {{investigated}} {{the influences of}} different precursor species on metal dispersion and sulfur capacity of adsorbents. Three kinds of adsorbents synthesized by different nickel precursor species (nickel formate, <b>nickel</b> acetate, <b>and</b> <b>nickel</b> nitrate) <b>and</b> supported on the γ-Al 2 O 3 were synthesized via the incipient impregnation method. The as-prepared adsorbents were characterized by nitrogen adsorption–desorption, temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR), O 2 –H 2 chemisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and FT-IR of adsorbed pyridine. Results show that adsorbent prepared by the nickel nitrate exhibits better performance compared to the adsorbents prepared by the <b>nickel</b> formate <b>and</b> <b>nickel</b> acetate precursors {{as a result of}} the smaller particle size and higher metal dispersion.|$|R
5|$|In nature, cobalt is {{frequently}} associated with <b>nickel,</b> <b>and</b> both are characteristic components of meteoric iron, though cobalt {{is much less}} abundant in iron meteorites than nickel. As with nickel, cobalt in meteoric iron alloys may have been well enough protected from oxygen and moisture to remain as the free (but alloyed) metal, though neither element is seen in that form in the ancient terrestrial crust.|$|E
5|$|Ni(IV) {{is present}} in the mixed oxide , while Ni(III) {{is present in}} nickel(III) oxide, which is used as the cathode in many {{rechargeable}} batteries, including nickel-cadmium, nickel-iron, nickel hydrogen, and nickel-metal hydride, and used by certain manufacturers in Li-ion batteries. Ni(IV) remains a rare oxidation state of <b>nickel</b> <b>and</b> very few compounds are known to date.|$|E
5|$|Osmium {{is found}} in nature as an uncombined element or in natural alloys; {{especially}} the iridium–osmium alloys, osmiridium (osmium rich), and iridosmium (iridium rich). In <b>nickel</b> <b>and</b> copper deposits, the platinum group metals occur as sulfides (i.e., (Pt,Pd)S)), tellurides (e.g., PtBiTe), antimonides (e.g., PdSb), and arsenides (e.g., PtAs2); in all these compounds platinum is exchanged by {{a small amount of}} iridium and osmium. As with all of the platinum group metals, osmium can be found naturally in alloys with nickel or copper.|$|E
30|$|Nickel {{adsorbents}} {{supported on}} the γ-Al 2 O 3 with different nickel precursor species (nickel formate, <b>nickel</b> acetate, <b>and</b> <b>nickel</b> nitrate) were prepared by the incipient impregnation method with nickel loadings at 10 %. The characterization results were identified by the adsorption experiments. Results indicated that precursor species significantly influenced the metal dispersion {{as well as the}} interaction between the <b>nickel</b> particles <b>and</b> γ-Al 2 O 3 support. Furthermore, the nickel nitrate adsorbent exhibited better sulfur capacity, metallic dispersion compared to the <b>nickel</b> formate <b>and</b> <b>nickel</b> acetate adsorbents. This work demonstrates that the precursor species is an important factor to influence the sulfur capacity and the stability of the adsorbents for gasoline.|$|R

5|$|The colours of glass, ceramic glazes, paints, pigments, and {{plastics}} {{are commonly}} {{produced by the}} inclusion of heavy metals (or their compounds) such as chromium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, selenium, zirconium, molybdenum, silver, tin, praseodymium, neodymium, erbium, tungsten, iridium, gold, lead, or uranium. Tattoo inks may contain heavy metals, such as chromium, cobalt, <b>nickel,</b> <b>and</b> copper.

Headlight reflectors rely on the excellent reflectivity of a thin film of rhodium.|$|E
5|$|The three-cent nickel piece {{initially}} circulated well, {{but became}} less popular when the five-cent nickel {{was introduced in}} 1866, a larger, more convenient coin, with a value of five cents better fitting the decimal system.

The last were struck in 1889; many were melted down to coin more five-cent pieces.
