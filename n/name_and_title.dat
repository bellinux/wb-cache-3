In the Red Keep, Cersei remains in her chambers, while Qyburn summons Grand Maester Pycelle to his laboratory, where his child spies stab Pycelle to death.|$|E

One month later and during the first battle against the Piper's New Nithling army, Arthur begins to recall his identity. The {{entirety}} of it is recovered later in the book when an officer mentions his <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>title.</b>|$|E
5|$|Efe's obverse dies {{show the}} king's <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>title,</b> usually spelt {{with a mixture}} of runes and Latin script, with some aspects of the coins {{occasionally}} ill-drawn or omitted altogether. The king's name is generally arranged around the central motif of a pellet (or a cross) within a circle of pellets: this layout probably derived from Northumbrian coins. The reverse dies consisted of a cross and the letters E F E, placed in four sectors that were divided off by lines. It can be shown that Efe did not use his dies in any particular or consistent order. Calculations have been made that suggest that few of his dies remain undiscovered.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, Ua Conchobair {{convened a}} great assembly at Athboy. The Annals of the Four Masters states that 13,000 horsemen attended the meeting—1,000 {{of which were}} supplied from Dublin. One of the many rulers recorded to have attended this gathering is a certain Ragnall mac Ragnaill, styled tigerna Gall ("lord of the foreigners"). The latter's <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>title</b> suggest that he was either an otherwise unattested brother of Ascall, or else an annalist's mistake for Ascall himself. Meanwhile, after his expulsion from Ireland, Mac Murchada sought out Henry on the Continent, and gained permission to recruit military aid from the latter's subjects. In the autumn of 1167, Mac Murchada and his English allies arrived in Ireland, where they established themselves at Ferns. Ua Conchobair responded by penetrating Uí Chennselaig in a campaign, recounted by the fourteenth-century Annals of Tigernach, that included military support from Dublin. With Mac Murchada temporally kept in check, a preoccupied Ua Conchobair allowed him to hold onto {{at least part of}} his patrimony.|$|E
5|$|During {{their attempt}} to escape Nalbina Dungeon, Vaan, Balthier, and Fran {{discovered}} Basch chained in a cage suspended from the ceiling. Though all three were initially suspicious of him (especially Vaan, who blamed him for Reks's death), Basch protested his innocence and told them about his twin. The party decided his story was plausible and released him. After being freed, he made it his mission to protect Ashe and support the resistance. When {{he and his brother}} were reunited, Gabranth was deeply puzzled by Basch's continued ability to hold his head high in spite of his past failures. Basch explained that his vow to defend Ashe had given him purpose and a renewed sense of honor. After the final battle against Vayne, as Noah was dying, he asked Basch to take his place as Larsa's protector. Because it was still widely believed that Basch was dead, he adopted his brother's <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>title</b> when he entered Larsa's service. In Revenant Wings, Basch is sent by Larsa to be the Empire's representative in dealing with the Judge of Wings. Basch was voiced by Keith Ferguson in English and by Rikiya Koyama in Japanese. He also appears in Itadaki Street Portable.|$|E

25|$|Superficially, Charlemagne {{seemed to}} have imposed himself on Benevento. Arechis had paid tribute {{and one of his}} sons was being held hostage as a {{guarantee}} of Benevento's loyalty. Frankish influence was also given formal expression. Traditionally Benevento had produced and used gold coinage, but from 787 the Beneventan mint began to strike silver coins too. The new coins were similar to those issued by Charlemagne's Frankish kingdom. Both the new silver and the traditional gold coins, as well as Beneventan legal documents, all started to include Charlemagne's <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>title</b> alongside those of Arechis. The inclusion of titles on coins and in charters was considered an important marker of political authority.|$|E

In 1336 he was {{invested}} {{with one of his}} father's minor Earldoms – that of Derby, and became Henry, Earl of Derby. Then, with his father's death in 1345, he finally became Henry of Lancaster – the main family <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>title</b> (Earl of Lancaster until 1351, Duke of Lancaster thenceforth). However, to avoid confusion with the father, it is customary to refer to the son as Henry of Grosmont throughout his career.|$|E

500|$|The band puts an {{emphasis}} on the sound of their songs and attempts to reduce the effect lyrics can have on the perception of songs by not releasing song lyrics with any album. Lyrical arrangements are often given special attention, such as in [...] "Lateralus". The number of syllables per line in the lyrics to [...] "Lateralus" [...] correspond to an arrangement of the Fibonacci numbers and the song [...] "Jambi" [...] uses and makes a reference to the common metrical foot iamb. The lyrics on Ænima and Lateralus focus on philosophy and spirituality—specific subjects range from organized religion in [...] "Opiate", to evolution and Jungian psychology in [...] "Forty-Six & 2" [...] and transcendence in [...] "Lateralus". On 10,000 Days, Keenan wanted to explore issues more personal to him: the album <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>title</b> track refer to the twenty-seven years during which his mother suffered from complications of a stroke until her death in 2003.|$|E
500|$|Although {{some critics}} and historians view the {{language}} and examples employed by the Drapier to describe the possible economic harms as over the top, others consider that Swift's imagery was grounded in truth. Even Swift's satire of Wood's character is based on actual evidence and added very little to what Wood provided the public through his words and actions. Although the Drapier emphasises Wood's involvement and not the king's, glosses of the first letter reveal allusions to Wood bribing the Duchess of Kendal that obscure the distinction to the careful reader. However, the Drapier always respects the king {{as leader of the}} Irish nation and the Irish church, although some critics see his bold language and free use of the king's <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>title</b> as undermining those positions. The Drapier makes sure that Wood appears to be the primary target, which, when combined with only an indirect attack upon people {{at the top of the}} British political system, reassured the people of Ireland that they could rebel against an [...] "insignificant hardware man".|$|E
