An unmodified commercially available puncture <b>needle</b> was used as a control.

25|$|A 2013 {{systematic}} {{review of the}} English-language case reports found that serious adverse events associated with acupuncture are rare, but that acupuncture is not without risk. Between 2000 and 2011 the English-language literature from 25 countries and regions reported 294 adverse events. The majority of the reported adverse events were relatively minor, and the incidences were low. For example, a prospective survey of 34,000 acupuncture treatments found no serious adverse events and 43 minor ones, a rate of 1.3 per 1000 interventions. Another survey found there were 7.1% minor adverse events, of which 5 were serious, amid 97,733 acupuncture patients. The most common adverse effect observed was infection (e.g. mycobacterium), {{and the majority of}} infections were bacterial in nature, caused by skin contact at the <b>needling</b> site. Infection has also resulted from skin contact with unsterilized equipment or with dirty towels in an unhygienic clinical setting. Other adverse complications included five reported cases of spinal cord injuries (e.g. migrating broken needles or <b>needling</b> too deeply), four brain injuries, four peripheral nerve injuries, five heart injuries, seven other organ and tissue injuries, bilateral hand edema, epithelioid granuloma, pseudolymphoma, argyria, pustules, pancytopenia, and scarring due to hot-needle technique. Adverse reactions from acupuncture, which are unusual and uncommon in typical acupuncture practice, included syncope, galactorrhoea, bilateral nystagmus, pyoderma gangrenosum, hepatotoxicity, eruptive lichen planus, and spontaneous needle migration.|$|E
25|$|Acupuncture needles {{during this}} period were much thicker than most modern ones and often {{resulted}} in infection. Infection {{is caused by a}} lack of sterilization, but at that time it was believed to be caused by use of the wrong needle, or <b>needling</b> in the wrong place, or at the wrong time. Later, many needles were heated in boiling water, or in a flame. Sometimes needles were used while they were still hot, creating a cauterizing effect at the injection site. Nine needles were recommended in the Chen Chiu Ta Chheng from 1601, which may have been because of an ancient Chinese belief that nine was a magic number.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigates <b>needle</b> insertion through soft tissue, {{enabling the}} development and validation of force models and insertion techniques for accurate <b>needle</b> tip placement. During <b>needle</b> insertion into the prostate, the <b>needle</b> deflects {{en route to the}} target which leads to seed misplacement and suboptimal dose to cancerous cells. Many researchers have studied slow <b>needle</b> insertion speed and axial - <b>needle</b> insertion direction - force distribution and components. However, little work has been performed on stiffer <b>needle</b> material properties, tissue deformation with <b>needle</b> deflection, and normal - perpendicular to <b>needle</b> insertion direction - force distribution. This lack of knowledge have led to tissue deformation, <b>needle</b> deflection, and misplaced target when performing <b>needle</b> insertion procedures. 	This research aims to quantify the impact of an optimized <b>needle</b> grid, insertion techniques, and needle-tissue force interaction leading to <b>needle</b> deflection and phantom deformation. First, an improved grid used to guide the <b>needle</b> was investigated and inserted via different hand insertion techniques to acquire <b>needle</b> deflection. To measure <b>needle</b> deflection, a measurement apparatus with acceptable gauge repeatability and reproducibility (GR&R) and documented accuracy was introduced. Next, stiffer <b>needle</b> properties were explored and inserted at much faster speed via a high-speed device, when compared to hand insertion or current robotic devices. Finally, finite element analysis (FEA) models were developed to predict relative needle-phantom motion using measured force data, while simultaneously obtaining experimental <b>needle</b> deflection and phantom deformation. The <b>needle</b> and phantom FEA models and the normal force distribution on the <b>needle</b> shaft were validated with separate experimental results. Findings from this dissertation include a 40 % decrease in average <b>needle</b> deflection with the improved grid (and the same fast hand insertion technique), in addition to a 60 % decrease in average <b>needle</b> deflection with the stiffer <b>needle</b> at the faster speed (compared to the less stiff <b>needle</b> and slow speed). Also, the <b>needle</b> and phantom FEA models are reasonably accurate to the experimental data, having a difference of 7 % and 18 %, respectively. These findings can be used to improve <b>needle</b> insertion techniques, while understanding force distribution effect on <b>needle</b> bending and compensate during the insertion path...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} advances {{knowledge in}} <b>needle</b> cutting of tissue {{leading to the}} invention and validation of the enhanced cutting edge (ECE) biopsy <b>needle.</b> Biopsy <b>needle</b> tip cutting edge geometry is defined using analytical models. With these geometrical definitions a mechanistic force model is developed to predict the <b>needle</b> insertion force for a given <b>needle</b> geometry. The force model then leads {{to the development of}} the improved ECE <b>needle</b> tip geometry. <b>Needle</b> biopsy is one of the most common medical procedures to cut and remove tissue for pathological diagnosis. Currently little study has focused on hollow <b>needle</b> tissue cutting. This lack of knowledge has led to the use of biopsy <b>needles</b> and devices that are inefficient at cutting tissue, thereby hindering the accuracy of the diagnosis, increasing the discomfort to the patient, and lengthening the procedure time. This dissertation directly fills this void in hollow <b>needle</b> tissue cutting knowledge to improve the yield of biopsy and advance the understanding of hollow <b>needle</b> tissue cutting in biopsy. This study is conducted in four topics that build on each other to reach the ultimate goal of developing the novel ECE biopsy <b>needle.</b> First, analytical models of <b>needle</b> geometry are developed for identification of inclination angle, normal rake angle, <b>needle</b> tip insertion length, and <b>needle</b> tip area on a variety of flat plane and curved <b>needle</b> tips. Second, oblique tissue cutting is studied through blade and <b>needle</b> tissue cutting experiments and three analytical models are developed to describe tissue flow angle and <b>needle</b> contact length. Third, a general hollow <b>needle</b> insertion force model is developed to predict <b>needle</b> insertion force. Fourth, a novel ECE <b>needle</b> tip is developed based on positive geometrical characteristics discovered by the force model for cutting tissue. This ECE <b>needle</b> is validated against a regular style <b>needle</b> and shown to produce longer biopsy sample lengths. This research aims to improve the procedure of <b>needle</b> biopsy through increasing fundamental knowledge in <b>needle</b> cutting mechanics and developing the improved <b>needle</b> geometry of the ECE <b>needle.</b> This research can lead to more accurate biopsy diagnosis, lower patient discomfort, and shorter procedure time...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Many medical {{procedures}} involve {{the use of}} <b>needles,</b> but targeting accuracy can be limited due to obstacles in the <b>needle’s</b> path, shifts in target position caused by tissue deformation, and undesired bending of the <b>needle</b> after insertion. In order to address these limitations, we have developed robotic systems that actively steer a <b>needle</b> in soft tissue. A bevel (asymmetric) tip causes the <b>needle</b> to bend during insertion, and steering is enhanced when the <b>needle</b> is very flexible. An experimental <b>needle</b> steering robot was designed that includes force/torque sensing, horizontal <b>needle</b> insertion, stereo image data acquisition, and controlled actuation of <b>needle</b> rotation and translation. Experiments were performed with a phantom tissue {{to determine the effects}} of insertion velocity and bevel tip angle on the <b>needle</b> path, as well as the forces acting on the <b>needle</b> during insertion. Results indicate that <b>needle</b> steering inside tissue does not depend on insertion velocity, but does depend on bevel tip angle. In addition, the forces acting on the <b>needle</b> are directly related to the insertion velocity. Index Terms — Keywords: medical robotics, <b>needle</b> steering, nonholonomic systems...|$|R

40|$|When a <b>needle</b> is {{inserted}} into soft tissue, interac- tion forces are {{developed at the}} <b>needle</b> tip and along the <b>needle</b> shaft.
