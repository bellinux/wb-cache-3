5000|$|The oral {{ingestion}} of live bacterial cell colonies {{has been proposed}} and is currently in therapy for the modulation of intestinal microflora, prevention of diarrheal diseases, treatment of H. Pylori infections, atopic inflammations, lactose intolerance and immune modulation, amongst others. The proposed mechanism of action is not fully understood but {{is believed to have}} two main effects. The first is the <b>nutritional</b> <b>effect,</b> in which the bacteria compete with toxin producing bacteria. The second is the sanitary effect, which stimulates resistance to colonization and stimulates immune response. [...] The oral delivery of bacterial cultures is often a problem because they are targeted by the immune system and often destroyed when taken orally. Artificial cells help address these issues by providing mimicry into the body and selective or long term release thus increasing the viability of bacteria reaching the gastrointestinal system. In addition, live bacterial cell encapsulation can be engineered to allow diffusion of small molecules including peptides into the body for therapeutic purposes. [...] Membranes that have proven successful for bacterial delivery include cellulose acetate and variants of alginate. Additional uses that have arosen from encapsulation of bacterial cells include protection against challenge from M. Tuberculosis and upregulation of Ig secreting cells from the immune system. The technology is limited by the risk of systemic infections, adverse metabolic activities and the risk of gene transfer. However, the greater challenge remains the delivery of sufficient viable bacteria to the site of interest.|$|E

30|$|Lack of {{information}} about the nutritional content of the two test lines. This critique is valid and such information would indeed be valuable, in particular since there were significant fitness-differences between D. magna fed GM versus UM maize feed. When we observed fitness differences in our test organisms, we presented several possible explanations for their appearance, including whether they were caused by potential nutritional differences. Our data, however, supported the hypothesis that a weak toxic effect was the underlying mechanism since earlier reproduction of animals fed Bt-maize came at the cost of later fecundity and survival/longevity.

40|$|Growth of {{ungulate}} populations {{is typically}} most sensitive to survival of neonates, {{which in turn}} is influenced by maternal nutritional condition and trade-offs in resource selection and avoidance of predators. We assessed whether resource use, multi-predator risk, maternal <b>nutritional</b> <b>effects,</b> hiding cover, or interactions among these variables best explained variation in daily survival of free-ranging neonatal white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) during their post-partum period (14 Mayâ€“ 31 Aug) in Michigan, USA. We used Cox proportional hazards mixed-effects models to assess survival related to covariates of resource use, composite predation risk of 4 mammalian predators, fawn body mass at birth, winter weather, and vegetation growth phenology. Predation, particularly from coyotes (Canis latrans), was the leading cause of mortality; however, an additive model of non-ideal resource use and maternal <b>nutritional</b> <b>effects</b> explained 71 % of the variation in survival. This relationship suggested that dams selected areas where fawns had poor resources, while greater predation in these areas led to additive mortalities beyond those related to resource use alone. Also, maternal <b>nutritional</b> <b>effects</b> suggested that severe winters resulted in dams producing smaller fawns, which decreased their likelihood of survival. Fawn resource use appeared to reflect dam avoidance of lowland forests with poor forage and greater use by wolves (C. lupus), their primary predator. While this strategy led to greater fawn mortality, particularly by coyotes, it likely promoted the life-long reproductive success of dams because many reached late-age (. 10 years old) and could have produced multiple generations of fawns...|$|R

40|$|Compounds or {{substances}} which act {{to reduce}} nutrient intake, digestion, absorption and utilization and may produce {{other adverse effects}} {{are referred to as}} antinutrients or antinutritional factors. Seeds of legumes and other plant sources contain in their raw state wide varieties of antinutrients which are potentially toxic.

These antinutrients pose a major constraint in the use of plant protein sources in livestock feeds without adequate and effective processing.
