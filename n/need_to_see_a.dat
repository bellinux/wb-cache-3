500|$|In October 1999, in {{the year}} {{following}} Tippett's death, A Child of Our Time received a belated New York Philharmonic premiere, at the Avery Fisher Hall. The New York Times reviewer, Paul Griffiths, expressed some astonishment {{that this was the}} orchestra's first attempt at the work. As part of the celebrations for the centenary of the composer's birth in January 2005, English National Opera staged a dramatised performance of the work, directed by Jonathan Kent—coincidentally, the first performance fell in the week of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the death camps at Auschwitz. Anna Picard, writing in The Independent, recognised the work's sincerity but found the dramatisation of its pacifist message wholly inappropriate: [...] "Do we really <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> dozen well-fed actors and singers stripped and led into a smoking pit {{in order to understand the}} Holocaust?" [...] Anthony Holden in The Observer was more positive, commenting that [...] "If you must stage a work intended for concert performance ... it is hard to imagine a more effective version than Kent's, shot through with heavy symbolism of which Tippett would surely have approved." [...] Nevertheless, Holden found the overall result [...] "super-solemn, lurching between the over-literalistic and the portentous". The 2005 Holocaust Days of Remembrance (1–8 May) were marked at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC by a special performance of A Child of Our time, in which the Washington Chorus was directed by Robert Shafer. The piece was performed at the BBC Proms 2016 on 23 July by the BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales.|$|E

In October 2011, Camoranesi made headlines for kicking an opponent in the head. In a match against Racing Club, Camoranesi fouled Patricio Toranzo and was shown a red card by the referee. Instead of walking off, Camoranesi ran back and kicked Toranzo in the head while Toranzo was still lying on the ground. Toranzo later commented that Camoranesi is [...] "not much of a man, just a coward" [...] and suggested Camoranesi would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> psychiatrist for his violent behaviour. Camoranesi faced a long ban from football for this incident.|$|E

2500|$|In an interview, Craven {{confirmed}} {{that he was}} contracted {{to work on a}} fifth and sixth installment of the Scream franchise, to be made if the fourth film achieved a successful release and reception. Following difficulties with script rewrites on Scream 2, Scream 3 and Scream 4, often with pages only being ready on the day of filming, and the related stress of the situation, Craven stated that he would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> finalized version of a script for Scream 5 before committing to the production. In a separate interview, writer Williamson also confirmed his contractual obligation for Scream 4 and Scream 5, having submitted concepts for three films leading up to Scream 6, though his contract for the sixth film had not yet been finalized. Williamson indicated that if a Scream 5 were to be made, it would be a continuation of the story of the characters who lived through Scream 4 but that Scream 4 would not include any cliffhangers that led into the potential sequel.|$|E
2500|$|Entity FX {{also had}} to create the first {{instance}} of Clark’s super hearing, an ability he acquires in the episode [...] "Whisper". As Beck describes the task: [...] "When you talk about someone flying, it’s something we all know, but this is super hearing and we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> visual for the hearing." [...] For the effect of showing Clark using his super hearing, Mat Beck and Entity FX decided {{that they wanted to}} travel into Clark’s ear and see all the different parts of his eardrum working together to create the sound he is hearing. The task proved difficult to achieve, and Beck asserts that changes will be made to perfect the look of Clark using his super hearing. Clark’s super hearing was originally to be revealed early in the season, but when The WB informed the Smallville team that Tarzan, the main character in the studio’s update of the classic legend, also had super hearing the team decided to delay the introduction so that the ability could be used in a manner that surpassed what was shown on Tarzan. Luckily for Smallville, The WB’s Tarzan was canceled before [...] "Whisper" [...] aired, allowing Smallville to be the only show on the network with a character who has superhuman hearing.|$|E
2500|$|A businessman, {{played by}} Scott Thompson, who was {{featured}} {{in a number of}} sketches. He is an executive at A.T. & Love, a company that also makes many appearances in unrelated sketches. In one sketch, his armpit odor becomes a best-selling, world-changing product. In another, he wakes up one morning and reads the newspaper, which states he has been kidnapped, after which he desperately gathers money to pay his own ransom. In yet another, Danny is summoned to the office of his boss, who needs to be consoled upon discovering [...] "brown stuff" [...] oozing from his mouth. Husk is successful in his consolation when he tells his boss that there is [...] "no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> doctor" [...] since the substance is odorless, and therefore, not [...] "poo-based". Another appearance has Danny's boss discover that he used to be a porn star by the name of Blade Rogers. In many of his appearances, Husk serves as a straight man to the wacky antics of one of the others. Dave Foley had a recurring role as Husk's rotund boss. Danny Husk ended up appearing in approximately a dozen sketches through seasons 1, 3, 4 and 5. Additionally, a variation of Husk, named Wally Terzinsky, appeared in the Kids' 1996 movie Brain Candy.|$|E

40|$|This {{bulletin}} {{examines the}} level of access {{to a range of}} health services by Australians with disability living in the community (excluding people living in institutions), and the experiences these people face in accessing health services. Abstract In 2012, 17 % of people with disability who <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> GP delayed or did not go because of the cost; 20 % who <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> medical specialist did not go mainly due to the cost; and 67 % who <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> dentist delayed seeing or did not go because of the cost. Compared with people with disability living in Major cities, people with disability living in Outer regional and Remote areas had lower use rates of services provided by GPs, medical specialists and dentists as well as coordinated care provided by different types of health professionals. They were more likely to visit a hospital emergency department for health issues that could potentially be dealt with by non-hospital services, and to face barriers to accessing health services...|$|R

60|$|All sensuality is one, {{though it}} takes many forms; all purity is one. It {{is the same}} whether a man eat, or drink, or cohabit, or sleep sensually. They are but one appetite, and we only <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> person do {{any one of these}} things to know how great a sensualist he is. The impure can neither stand nor sit with purity. When the reptile is {{attacked}} at one mouth of his burrow, he shows himself at another. If you would be chaste, you must be temperate. What is chastity? How shall a man know if he is chaste? He shall not know it. We have heard of this virtue, but we know not what it is. We speak conformably to the rumor which we have heard. From exertion come wisdom and purity; from sloth ignorance and sensuality. In the student sensuality is a sluggish habit of mind. An unclean person is universally a slothful one, one who sits by a stove, whom the sun shines on prostrate, who reposes without being fatigued. If you would avoid uncleanness, and all the sins, work earnestly, though it be at cleaning a stable. Nature is hard to be overcome, but she must be overcome. What avails it that you are Christian, if you are not purer than the heathen, if you deny yourself no more, if you are not more religious? I know of many systems of religion esteemed heathenish whose precepts fill the reader with shame, and provoke him to new endeavors, though it be to the performance of rites merely.|$|E

60|$|He {{sat there}} {{face to face}} with her and for some time said nothing. He had a mixture of feelings, and the memory of other places, other hours, was {{stealing}} over him. There had been of old a very considerable absence of interposing surfaces between these two—he had known her as one knew people only amid the civilisation of big tornadoes and back piazzas. He had liked her extremely in a place where it would have been ridiculous to be difficult to please. But his sense of this fact was somehow connected with other and such now alien facts; his liking for Nancy Beck was an emotion of which the sole setting was a back piazza. She presented herself here on a new basis—she appeared to want to be classified afresh. Littlemore said to himself that this was too much trouble; he had taken her at the great time in that way—he couldn’t begin at this late hour to take her in another way. He asked himself if she were {{going to be a real}} bore. It wasn’t easy to suppose her bent on ravage, but she might become tiresome if she were too disposed to be different. It made him rather afraid when she began to talk about European society, about his sister, to pronounce things vulgar. Littlemore was naturally merciful and decently just; but there was in his composition an element of the indolent, the sceptical, perhaps even the brutal, which made him decidedly prefer the simplicity of their former terms of intercourse. He had no particular <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> woman rise again, as the mystic process was called; he didn’t believe in women’s rising again. He believed in their not going down, thought it perfectly possible and eminently desirable; but held it was much better for society that the divisions, the categories, the differing values, should be kept clear. He didn’t believe in bridging the chasms, in muddling the kinds. In general he didn’t pretend to say what was good for society—society seemed to him rather in a bad way; but he had a conviction on this particular point. Nancy Beck going in for the great prizes, that spectacle might be entertaining for a simple spectator; but it would be a nuisance, an embarrassment, from the moment anything more than detached “fun” should represent his share. He had no wish to be “mean,” but it might be well to show her he wasn’t to be humbugged.|$|E
