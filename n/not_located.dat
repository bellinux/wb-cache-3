5|$|The ASAT test mission, {{the final}} {{flight of the}} High Virgo missile, was {{conducted}} on September 22, 1959. Less than a minute after {{the launch of the}} missile from its B-58 carrier aircraft at Mach 2, the telemetry signal was lost. No data was recovered from the test, and the camera data, intended to be recovered afterward, was <b>not</b> <b>located.</b> Hence the test was inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|The only genus {{that has}} {{retained}} the enlarged ventral scales is the sea kraits, Laticauda, with only five species. These snakes {{are considered to}} be more primitive, as they still spend much of their time on land, where their ventral scales afford them the necessary grip. Laticauda species are also the only sea snakes with internasal scales, i.e., their nostrils are <b>not</b> <b>located</b> dorsally.|$|E
5|$|A {{feature of}} central York is the Snickelways, narrow {{pedestrian}} routes, {{many of which}} led towards the former market-places in Pavement and St Sampson's Square. The Shambles is a narrow medieval street, lined with shops, boutiques and tea rooms. Most of these premises were once butchers' shops, and the hooks from which carcasses were hung and the shelves on which meat was laid out can still be seen outside some of them. The street also contains the Shrine of Margaret Clitherow, although it is <b>not</b> <b>located</b> {{in the house where}} she lived. Goodramgate has many medieval houses including the early 14thcentury Lady Row built to finance a Chantry, {{at the edge of the}} churchyard of Holy Trinity church.|$|E

5|$|An Administrator was {{assisted}} {{by one or}} several Commandants (Duwei 都尉) also known as Chief Commandant, who handled all local military affairs such as raising militias, suppressing bandit groups, and building beacon towers. The Commandants' salary-rank was Equivalent to 2,000-dan. After 30 AD, all Commandants who were <b>not</b> <b>located</b> in distant frontier commanderies were abolished, yet if the commandery was located along borders where raids and armed incursions by hostile nomadic groups were frequent, he was still appointed. A Commandant in an interior commandery could only be appointed temporarily to deal with crises as they arose. Each commandery also had secretaries, a treasurer, and an Official in Charge of Accounts who submitted annual reports to the imperial court on the Administrator's performance.|$|E
5|$|At first, Schwarzkopf was {{ambivalent}} {{during the}} run-up to the Iraq War in 2003. He initially endorsed an invasion after Colin Powell's presentation to the United Nations on February 6, 2003. When weapons of mass destruction were <b>not</b> <b>located</b> in the country after the invasion, he changed his stance. He was critical of the lack of a reconstruction plan after the fall of Baghdad, feeling the initial offensive operations plans did {{not take into account the}} cultural complexities of Iraq. In 2004, he was critical of Donald Rumsfeld and his handling of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He felt it was a mistake to send U.S. Army Reserve troops into the country without adequate training.|$|E
5|$|By June29, a trough, {{moving through}} the westerlies, rapidly {{approached}} the storm, causing the newly designated Amy to turn sharply toward the east. Strong wind shear disorganized the system slightly, leading to Amy featuring subtropical characteristics. By the evening, the strongest winds were <b>not</b> <b>located</b> around the center, but were instead situated between 60 and 90mi (95 and 140km) from the center. Convection became displaced {{from the center of}} circulation but the storm continued to intensify. Over the following several days, Amy tracked generally northeastward but underwent eastward jogs in response to rapidly moving troughs to the north.|$|E

5|$|Chocobo Tales {{features}} {{a mix of}} three different types of gameplay; role-playing video game, exploration, and card battles. Players explore a 3D environment to find picture books. Upon finding them the player is transported into pop-up picture books to complete minigames and open {{the path to the}} next part of the story. The picture books take the form of Aesop's Fables and Grimm's Fairy Tales with the player character often taking the main role. Other Final Fantasy characters take up roles within the stories. More simplistic minigames, known as microgames, are also scattered throughout the world. Unlike minigames, these are <b>not</b> <b>located</b> within pop-up books, do not affect the game-world and are not required to progress in the game.|$|E
5|$|Like rauisuchians, Batrachotomus {{walked with}} an erect posture, {{although}} the limbs were <b>not</b> <b>located</b> {{directly under the}} trunk. The limbs were not equal in length as the forelimbs were about 70% of the hindlimbs. The toe bones (phalanges) are poorly preserved and the only well known bone is a fifth metatarsal (bone in hindlimbs attached to the toe bones) which was hooked in shape. However, hypotheses suggest that probably each forelimb had four toes and each hindlimb five.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{is one of}} the {{few large}} cities of Nebraska <b>not</b> <b>located</b> along either the Platte River or the Missouri River. The city was {{originally}} laid out near Salt Creek and among the nearly flat saline wetlands of northern Lancaster County. The city's growth over the years has led to development of the surrounding land, much of which is composed of gently rolling hills. In recent years, Lincoln's northward growth has encroached on the habitat of the endangered Salt Creek tiger beetle.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of SEATO members were <b>not</b> <b>located</b> in Southeast Asia. To Australia and New Zealand, SEATO {{was seen as}} a more satisfying organization than ANZUS – a collective defense organization with the U.S. The United Kingdom and France joined partly due to having long maintained colonies in the region, and partly due to concerns over developments in Indochina. Pakistan, however, was simply interested in joining over the appeal of potential support for its long struggle against India. Last but not least, the U.S. upon perceiving Southeast Asia to be a pivotal frontier for Cold War geopolitics saw the establishment of SEATO as essential to its Cold War containment policy.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} differential diagnosis in gout is septic arthritis. This {{should be considered}} in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment. To help with diagnosis, a synovial fluid Gram stain and culture may be performed. Other conditions that can look similar include pseudogout, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and reactive arthritis. Gouty tophi, in particular when <b>not</b> <b>located</b> in a joint, can be mistaken for basal cell carcinoma or other neoplasms.|$|E

5|$|A call to {{increase}} the battery life of ULBs was once again made after the unsuccessful initial search in 2009 for the flight recorders on Air France Flight 447, which were <b>not</b> <b>located</b> until 2011. A formal recommendation that the ULB design be upgraded to offer a longer battery life or to make the recorders ejectable had {{been included in the}} final report of the board of inquiry into the loss of South African Airways Flight 295 over the Indian Ocean in 1987; however, the ICAO did not make such a recommendation until 2014, with implementation by 2018. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued new regulations requiring that the transmitting time of ULBs fitted to aircraft flight recorders be increased from 30 to 90 days. The agency proposed a new underwater locator beacon with a greater transmitting range to be fitted to aircraft flying over oceans. In June 2015, Dukane, a manufacturer of underwater locator beacons, began selling beacons with a 90-day battery life.|$|E
5|$|By September 1997, Cracker Barrel had 314 restaurants, {{and aimed}} to {{increase}} the number of stores by approximately 50 per year over the following five years. The firm closed its Corner Market operations in 1997 and refocused on its restaurant and gift store locations. Its then president, Ron Magruder, stated that the chain was concentrating on strengthening its core theme, offering traditional foods and retail in a country store setting, with good service and country music. The chain opened its first restaurant and gift store <b>not</b> <b>located</b> near a highway in 1998, in Dothan, Alabama. In the 2000s, in the wake of incidents including charges of racial discrimination and controversy over its policy of firing gay employees, the firm launched a series of promotional activities including a nationwide book drive and a sweepstakes with trips to the Country Music Association Awards and rocking chairs among the prizes.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's dissections and {{documentation}} of muscles, nerves, and vessels helped {{to describe the}} physiology and mechanics of movement. He attempted to identify the source of 'emotions' and their expression. He {{found it difficult to}} incorporate the prevailing system and theories of bodily humours, but eventually he abandoned these physiological explanations of bodily functions. He made the observations that humours were <b>not</b> <b>located</b> in cerebral spaces or ventricles. He documented that the humours were not contained in the heart or the liver, and that it was the heart that defined the circulatory system. He was the first to define atherosclerosis and liver cirrhosis. He created models of the cerebral ventricles with the use of melted wax and constructed a glass aorta to observe the circulation of blood through the aortic valve by using water and grass seed to watch flow patterns. Vesalius published his work on anatomy and physiology in De humani corporis fabrica in 1543.|$|E

5|$|The squadron's {{activities}} {{expanded in}} early 1944, when its obsolescent Hudsons were replaced with more capable Douglas Dakota transports. It received its first Dakota on 3 March 1944, and was completely {{equipped with the}} type {{by the end of}} May. While the squadron continued to fly to locations within Australia after receiving Dakotas, it also began transporting supplies to Allied forces fighting the Japanese in western New Guinea. During return flights from New Guinea, the Dakotas typically carried wounded personnel to Australia for treatment. In October 1944, No. 38 Squadron was given the additional task of supporting the RAAF's Paratroop Training Unit at Richmond. The squadron moved to RAAF Station Archerfield near Brisbane in early December 1944, but continued to maintain a detachment at Richmond. By this time No. 38 Squadron was mainly tasked with transporting supplies to the battle zone in New Guinea, which included making supply drops to Australian Army units in the field and evacuating casualties to the mainland. From 17 July 1945, the squadron maintained a detachment at Morotai Island, which dropped supplies to Army units fighting in Borneo. No. 38 Squadron's only loss during World War II was a Dakota that crashed on a mountain in western New Guinea while flying between Biak and Morotai; the wreckage of this aircraft was <b>not</b> <b>located</b> until 1970.|$|E
5|$|This {{confusion}} {{in the identification of}} the site has hindered study. The Chajoma capital has been investigated archaeologically, under the assumption that it was the Poqomam capital. Although the Chajoma ruins of Jilotepeque Viejo have been well described archaeologically, the archaeological data has been associated with the history of a different site entirely. Doubts about the identification of the archaeological site were first raised by Robert M. Carmack, who realised that the supposed Poqomam capital was <b>not</b> <b>located</b> within the Poqomam linguistic area but rather within the linguistic area of the Kaqchikels. The Poqomam who were settled in the new colonial settlement of Mixco by the Spanish had a long history of fine polychrome ceramic production, but no evidence of such production had been recovered during archaeological investigations, and the ruins were considered too distant from colonial Mixco.|$|E
5|$|An {{amendment}} to the Government of India's Environment Impact Assessment Notification of 1994 was made in 2004, which required that environmental clearance be granted to any parcel of land that falls under the Yamuna floodplain before beginning any construction activities. Since Akshardham commenced construction activities in 2000, prior to the enactment of this amendment, it {{did not apply to}} Akshardham. However certain NGOs and activists felt that the temple was constructed without obtaining the necessary environmental clearances. On January 2005, the U.P. Employees Federation presented their case before the Supreme Court of India that the temple had not obtained necessary environmental clearances {{and that it would be}} harmful to the environment. After hearing the case, the Supreme Court observed that in the construction of Akshardham, all the Land Use Plans had been adhered to and clearance of expert bodies like the Central Water Commission and the National Environment Engineering Research Institute has been obtained. Thus, the Supreme Court ruled that the Akshardham construction was lawful and did not violate environmental norms. Despite this ruling, some activists and politicians continued to assert that the Akshardham construction was illegal and posed a threat to the Yamuna River floodplains. In a 2009 ruling on a related issue, the Supreme Court further clarified that it rejected as false the assertions that Akshardham did not have environmental permissions and was harmful to the Yamuna riverbed. It reiterated its earlier 2005 Ruling that Akshardham had received all necessary environmental permissions from Central Water Commission and NEERI, which is an autonomous body, and that the Akshardham site was <b>not</b> <b>located</b> on the Yamuna “riverbed” or “floodplain”, but 1700 meters away from the Yamuna River bank.|$|E
