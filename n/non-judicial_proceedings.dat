50|$|Justice Somers {{agreed with}} Cooke J that the appeal should be dismissed:"the {{privilege}} against self-incrimination which {{is capable of}} applying to <b>non-judicial</b> <b>proceedings</b> of which this is one has been impliedly excluded {{by the terms of}} the regulation. If it were not so the right to inquire and the duty to answer would be largely illusory.... and I consider it clear that the purposes of the Board mentioned in para (n) s 24(1) of the Poultry Board Act include securing the observance and the policing of regulations which set out the mode by which its functions are carried out.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, inquests are {{generally}} conducted by coroners, who {{are generally}} officials of a county or city. These inquests are not themselves trials, but investigations. Depending on the state, {{they may be}} characterized as judicial, quasi-judicial, or <b>non-judicial</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Inquests, and the necessity for holding them, are matters of statutory law in the United States. Statutes may also regulate the requirement for summoning and swearing a coroner's jury. Inquests themselves generally are public proceedings, though the accused may not be entitled to attend. Coroners may compel witnesses to attend and give testimony at inquires, and may punish a witness for refusing to testify according to statute. Coroners are generally not bound by the jury's conclusion, and have broad discretion, which in many jurisdictions cannot be appealed. The effect of a coroner's verdict at common law was equivalent to a finding by a grand jury, whereas some statutes provide that a verdict makes the accused liable for arrest. Generally, the county or city {{is responsible for the}} fees of conducting an inquest, but some statutes have provided for the recovery of such costs. Whether the evidence presented at an inquest can be used in subsequent civil actions depends on the jurisdiction, though at common law, the inquest verdict was admissible to show cause of death. Coroners' reports and findings, on the other hand, are generally admissible.|$|E
50|$|There is {{conflicting}} {{authority on}} whether {{legal professional privilege}} applies to communications prepared {{for the purpose of}} <b>non-judicial</b> legal <b>proceedings,</b> such as in administrative tribunals or commissions of enquiry. These conflicts have generally not reached appellate level.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Non-judicial</b> {{punishment}} <b>proceedings</b> {{are known}} by different terms among the services. In the Army and the Air Force, non-judicial punishment {{is referred to}} as Article 15; in the Marine Corps it is called being [...] "NJP'd", [...] "Ninja Punched", or being sent to [...] "Office Hours". The Navy and the Coast Guard call non-judicial punishment captain's mast or admiral's mast, depending on the rank of the commanding officer.|$|R
2500|$|According to his {{military}} record {{obtained in the}} course of his 1994 fraud trial, after serving one term of service Idema was not allowed to reenlist, likely due to poor performance. He had received numerous negative remarks from superior officers in addition to participating in three <b>non-judicial</b> punishment <b>proceedings.</b> Idema was cited for [...] "failure to obey orders, being derelict in the performance of his duty, and being disrespectful to a superior commanding officer." [...] One superior officer, Capt. John D. Carlson stated that Idema [...] "is without a doubt the most unmotivated, unprofessional, immature enlisted man I have ever known." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{establishment}} of the Office of the European Ombudsman by the Maastricht Treaty was explicit {{in connection with the}} demonstration of the Union, as a complex of democratically functioning bodies. Democratically functioning is in necessary connection with transparency, openness and accountability. Transparency and openness are key requirement set as aims by the European Union in connection with the decision-making procedure of bodies and offices, and between the European bureaucracy and the European citizens. In every member state of the European Union there are <b>non-judicial</b> and nonlitigious <b>proceedings</b> to settle the community and administrative disputes. The career of the institution of the ombudsman started in the 1700 â€™s and at present time {{one of the most important}} phase was the {{establishment of}} the institution at supranational level...|$|R
