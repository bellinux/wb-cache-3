40|$|The arctic is {{currently}} experiencing {{some of the}} greatest rates of warming. Newly emerging diseases in the arctic are of particular interest due to the implications these may have at southern latitudes if temperatures continue to rise around the globe. It is important to document changes in pathogen populations, such as alterations in range, virulence, prevalence, and abundance, and the effect these may have on their host populations. Parasites influence the reproductive success of their hosts in some cases. Studies on impacts of ectoparasites on avian reproductive success have generally been focused on species with altricial young. I studied the abundance of an apparently newly emerging nest-parasite and the effects of this parasite on Ross’s (Chen rossii) and lesser snow goose (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) reproductive success in the Karrak Lake goose colony, Nunavut, Canada from 2001 to 2004. The nest parasite, identified as the flea Ceratophyllus vagabundus vagabundus, was associated with goose eggs covered with spots of blood. The proportion of goose egg-shells covered by blood was positively correlated with flea abundance in the nest. This relationship allowed the use egg blood-coverage as an index of flea abundance for remaining analyses. Flea abundance in goose nests was associated with variables associated with the host and the host’s habitat. I used general linear models in conjunction with Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) to determine which factors were most important in influencing flea abundance in goose nests. The most parsimonious model to explain the relationship between egg blood coverage and flea abundance in goose nests included goose clutch size, age of <b>nest</b> <b>bowl</b> (new vs. old), history of nesting by geese on a specific plot within the colony, habitat within 0. 5 m of nest, and year. The best predictor of flea abundance was the age of the <b>nest</b> <b>bowl,</b> with <b>nest</b> <b>bowls</b> re-used by geese containing more fleas than new bowls. This relationship was expected as fleas over-wintered in goose nests at the Karrak Lake colony. Logistic regression and AIC were used to determine whether egg blood-coverage was an important variable influencing nest success. All top five models included blood-coverage. Goose nest success was negatively influenced by fleas in most years. There was a threshold of egg blood-coverage at which nest success was affected, and this threshold varied, with > 20 % blood indicating a significant decline in nest success in two years, and > 5 % blood-coverage indicating a decrease in nest success in one year. To my knowledge, this is the first study that has examined the parasites of avian nests in an arctic ecosystem and was also the first to investigate the effect of nest parasites on birds with precocial young. More {{research is needed to determine}} what factors limit this flea population and whether fleas may become a regulating factor for geese in the Karrak Lake colony...|$|R

40|$|Artificial nests {{have been}} used to study factors {{affecting}} nest success because researchers can manipulate them more than natural bird nests. Many researchers have questioned the validity of generalizing the results from artificial nests onto naturally occurring nests. Other studies have assessed the validity of artificial nest studies by simultaneously comparing overall depredation or daily survival rates, depredation timing, predator species, or habitat characteristics of artificial and natural nests. To evaluate how well artificial nests simulated nest success of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; hereafter, sagegrouse), we used the unique approach of monitoring artificial nests (n = 69) placed in the natural <b>nest</b> <b>bowls</b> of sage-grouse in southern Wyoming, USA, during 2010 to 2011. Brown chicken eggs were placed in natural sage-grouse nests 7 to 14 days after the hatch or depredation of natural sage-grouse nests to compare artificial nest fate to the fate of natural sage-grouse nests. As secondary objectives, we placed cameras next to a subset of artificial nests to identify which predator species were depredating nests, and we assessed the effects of corvid (black-billed magpie [Pica hudsonia] and common raven [Corvus corax]) density, nest-site characteristics (i. e., anthropogenic development, landscape variables, and microhabitat) date of depredation, and presence of a camera near <b>nest</b> <b>bowls</b> on the depredation rate of all artificial nests. We found that depredation of artificial nests paralleled the fate of natural sagegrouse nests. Depredations were more likely to occur earlier in the summer (June to early July rather than late July to early August). Depredation of artificial nests was negligible as time progressed past the typical sage-grouse nesting season, supporting the hypothesis of predators using a search image to detect eggs. We also found that shorter perennial grass height and greater magpie densities were positively associated with the depredation rates of artificial nests. Camera-recorded depredation events verified that 4 badgers (Taxidea taxus), 2 magpies, and 1 domestic cow depredated artificial nests. Artificial nests may give managers insight into the expected nest success rates of sage-grouse in areas of conservation interest. However, care must be taken regarding placement and timing of artificial nests for reliable conclusions to be drawn from artificial nest studies. Furthermore, identifying predators based on artificial nests likely leads to inaccurate assessment of local species composition of nest depredators...|$|R
40|$|During {{eight years}} of study of a {{population}} of pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca breeding in central Spain, we observed throughout incubation 22 cases of intact eggs being placed on the nest rim and clearly outside of the <b>nest</b> <b>bowl</b> and remaining there, with consequent embryo mortality. We assume that the removal of eggs had been performed by the incubating female. There {{is no evidence that}} pied flycatcher parents can detect embryo mortality and eject unhatchable eggs. Maternal egg ejection constitutes a direct mechanism of clutch size adjustment during incubation and before hatching of any young of the brood. This adjustment of clutch size happened when the mean and minimum temperature of the day before ejection were especially low. Also, clutch-reducing females were significantly more prone to show moult-breeding overlap than other females, suggesting a lower disposition to invest in reproduction. Clutch-reducing females were also frequently older than four years and had indications of a lower immunocompetence than females not ejecting eggs. Our results support the hypothesis that adverse conditions can elicit parental family size adjustment at every stage of reproduction without the need to depend on mechanisms of sibling competition.

40|$|Habitat {{selection}} theory {{presumes that}} organisms are not distributed randomly in their environments because of habitat-specific differences in reproductive success and survival; unfortunately, many previous studies were either unable {{or failed to}} look for evidence of processes shaping nest site selection patterns. Furthermore, {{little is known about}} adaptive nest site selection in northern environments where habitats often have little vegetation and time and climatic constraints may be pronounced. Therefore, I investigated patterns of nest site selection by common eider ducks (Somateria mollissima) at an island colony in Canada’s Eastern Arctic, and looked for evidence of selective processes underlying these patterns by employing experimental and observational techniques. I characterized physical features of (a) non-nest sites (b) active nest sites and (c) unoccupied nest sites that had been used in previous years. Habitat features that distinguished non-nest sites from unoccupied nest sites were also important in distinguishing between active and unoccupied nest sites during the breeding season. Active nest sites were closer to herring gull (Larus argentatus) nests, farther from the ocean and had organic substrates. In general, habitat features associated with nest use were not strongly associated with success after the onset of incubation. Nests near fresh water ponds were more successful in one study year, but in the other two study years successful nests were initiated earlier and more synchronously than were unsuccessful nests. Common eiders settled to nest first near the geographic centre of the colony, whereas sites near the largest fresh water pond were occupied later; distance to ocean had no observable effect on timing of nesting. Nest density was greater farther from the ocean, but timing of nest establishment did not differ between high and low density plots. I tested whether moss or duck down placed in <b>nest</b> <b>bowls</b> could increase <b>nest</b> establishment, or advance laying date. I placed this extraneous material in <b>bowls</b> before <b>nesting</b> and found no difference in likelihood of <b>nest</b> establishment; however, <b>bowls</b> containing duck down were initiated earlier (or had higher survival) than those containing no nesting material. To investigate the role of nest shelter and microclimate in nest site choices and female body condition, I placed plywood nest shelters over established nests. Temperature probes indicated that artificially-sheltered females experienced more moderate thermal environments and maintained higher body weight during late incubation than did unsheltered females. However, few eiders nested at naturally-sheltered sites, possibly because nest concealment increases susceptibility to mammalian predators. My results suggest that eider nest choices likely reflect trade-offs among selective pressures that involve the local predator community, egg concealment, nest microclimate and energy use...|$|R

40|$|Arctic {{terrestrial}} {{ecosystems are}} ideal systems to study host-parasite interactions {{because they are}} sensitive and have fewer confounding interactions than lower latitudes. Since the Arctic is experiencing rapid climate change, research there can provide models to better understand and predict future changes in other systems. The Barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) and its ectoparasite the flea (Ceratophyllus vagabundus vagabundus) is an ideal Arctic host-parasite system to study because Barnacle geese have important roles in Arctic ecosystems as selective grazers and prey items and have been intensively studied for decades. Also, recent studies suggest that Arctic avian flea infestations may be increasing, possibly due to climate change. However, few studies have considered the effect of fleas on Arctic nesting birds and little is known of Arctic avian flea ecology, most importantly whether they overwinter in the High Arctic or are reintroduced each summer by migrating birds. Furthermore, sampling methods for avian fleas are time-consuming and semi-invasive to their hosts. Therefore, the project had four aims: (i) {{contribute to the knowledge}} of Arctic flea ecology by looking for evidence of overwintering, (ii) use an experimental study {{to assess the impact of}} flea infestations on the hatching success of Barnacle goose eggs, (iii) assess the simple and disturbance-free method of estimating fleas with photographs of blood spots on goose eggs, (iv) and test the results of both the experimental study as well as the application of blood spots as a proxy measure for flea infestations through a larger observational study. It was found that fleas were likely overwintering in empty <b>nest</b> <b>bowls</b> and some evidence indicated that they might be capable of a two-year life cycle in the High Arctic. The findings from the experimental study indicated that heavy flea infestations had a negative impact on the hatching success of Barnacle goose eggs. It was also determined that blood spots were a good proxy measure of flea infestations, but become less accurate through incubation due to wear from incubating birds. Finally, the observational study supported the findings of the experimental study and demonstrated the power and simplicity of using blood spots as a proxy measure for flea infestations. Based on these findings, it is suggested that researchers interested in either reproductive success or incubation behavior of Barnacle geese should include a measure of flea infestations in their studies and using blood spots as a proxy measure is a simple and disturbance-free method of doing this...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2014. Major: Conservation Biology. Advisor: Dr. Robert B. Blair. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 136 pages. An {{understanding of how}} species responds to urbanization is important for conservation and management of possible human-wildlife conflicts. Wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) have recently successfully entered many urban landscapes, however their apparent success remain poorly understood. Most studies of wild turkeys have occurred in forested or agricultural landscapes. I estimated several important demographic, home range, and habitat use behaviors for wild turkey in areas of varying degrees of urbanization in the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, USA, metropolitan area. My research objectives centered on providing the first information on urban wild turkey ecology, including: 1) assessing urban wild turkey nesting behavior and possible changes to reproductive measures, 2) investigation of urban wild turkey survival {{and the influence of}} local mortality agents, and 3) assessing urban wild turkey home range characteristics and habitat use. I captured and equipped 60 female wild turkeys with back-pack style VHF radio transmitters during 2010 - 2013. Monitored female wild turkey reproductive measures and nest survival were remarkably similar both among my study areas and previous rural wild turkey research. For all monitored females across all study areas and years, first nesting rate was 73. 7 % (n = 57), average date of onset of incubation was 2 May (n = 42), and hatch rate was 84 % (n = 26). For all monitored females across all study areas and years mean clutch size was 10. 2 (n = 42), and differed by study area (÷ 2 = 8. 30, DF = 2, P = 0. 02). For all monitored females across all study areas and years nest survival rate was 0. 56 (n = 42). Monitored nests tended to have high visual concealment at the <b>nest</b> <b>bowl,</b> with a strong trend for habitat variables related to vegetative density and height at the <b>nest</b> <b>bowl</b> scale, and distance to open water on the greater landscape. Across all study areas and all female wild turkeys in 2010 - 2013 the annual survival rate was 0. 43 (CI = 0. 32 - 0. 58; n = 55). Across all study areas and all female wild turkeys in 2010 - 2013, seasonal survival rates were as follows: 1) spring survival rate was 0. 61 (CI = 0. 50 - 0. 75; n = 55); 2) summer survival rate was 0. 83 (CI = 0. 71 - 0. 96; n = 34); 3) autumn survival rate was 0. 89 (CI = 0. 75 - 0. 99; n = 28); and 4) winter survival rate of 0. 96 (CI = 0. 89 - 1. 0; n = 25). During the brooding seasons of 2010 through 2012, an estimated 216 poults successfully hatched. Combined poult survival rate to 2 weeks post-hatch was 0. 35, declining to 0. 26 4 -weeks post-hatch. Overall, mammalian and avian predation accounted for 63. 3 % of all observed female mortalities, followed by vehicle strikes (23. 3 %), harvest (3. 3 %), and unknown causes (10. 0 %). Predation remained the leading cause of mortality regardless of age-class, although predation tended to be higher in female adults (61. 5 %) than juveniles (47. 1 %). Across all study areas and all female wild turkeys, average annual home range size was 41. 3 ha (n = 28). Annual home range size for suburban females (64. 5 ha, n = 9) was larger than rural (38. 0 ha, n = 11) or urban females (19. 6 ha, n = 8), with home range size differing between study areas (÷ 2 = 12. 26, DF = 2, P = 0. 002). Spring/summer home ranges included both females that attempted to nest, brooding hens, and non-reproductively active females. Across all study areas and all female wild turkeys, average spring/summer home range size was 26. 4 ha (n = 37). Spring/summer home range size for suburban (44. 8 ha, n = 11), rural (23. 0 ha, n = 17), and urban females (10. 3 ha, n = 9) did not differ. Across all study areas and all female wild turkeys average autumn/winter home range size was 25. 1 ha (n = 28). Autumn/winter home range size for suburban (30. 9 ha, n = 9), rural (28. 6 ha, n = 11), and urban females (13. 8 ha, n = 8) did not differ. Habitat use by wild turkey populations in urban settings relied heavily on `natural-like' habitat, as well as on developed, human-dominated areas. For this study `natural-like' habitat (i. e., parkland, conifer tree) was predictive of spring/summer habitat use and developed habitat (i. e., residential areas, agricultural) was predictive of autumn/winter habitat use. These range shifts are likely linked to resource availability and specific habitat availability (i. e., nesting and brood habitats) ...|$|R
