We demonstrate that <b>N-methylformamide</b> in vitro pretreatment of M 14 cells, although inducing {{a significant increase in}} the expression of alpha 2 beta 1, alpha 6 beta 1 and alpha(v) beta 3 integrin receptors, slightly modifies alpha 5 beta 1 heterodimer and beta 1 subunit expression.

The reactions catalyzed by the Rh 2 II,II catalysts start from the oxidation of the Rh 2 II,II dimer to a triplet mixed-valent Rh 2 II,III–nitrene radical, which should facilitate radical H-atom abstraction. However, in the Rh 2 (formate) 4 -promoted reaction, {{as a result of}} a minimum-energy crossing point (MECP) between the singlet and triplet profiles, a direct C–H bond insertion is postulated. The Rh 2 (<b>N-methylformamide)</b> 4 reaction exhibits quite different mechanistic characteristics, taking place via a two-step process involving (i) intramolecular H-abstraction on the triplet profile to generate a diradical intermediate and (ii) C–N formation by intersystem crossing from the triplet state to the open-shell singlet state. The stepwise mechanism was found to hold also in the reaction of 3 -phenylpropylsulfamate ester catalyzed by Rh 2 (S-nap) 4. Furthermore, the diradical intermediate also constitutes the starting point for competition steps involving enantioselectivity, which is determined by the C–N formation open-shell singlet transition state.
