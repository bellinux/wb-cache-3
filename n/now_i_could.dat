25|$|In the {{tried and}} true way of all major labels at the time, {{they really wanted to}} sign Dave but got a {{troublesome}} band instead. It was probably Island's insistence that Alsy and Marty weren't up to it that caused the Craig Leon sessions to be the unmitigated disaster that they were. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be wrong here, maybe Craig wanted them out, maybe both. We were pretty much forced to let a couple of session guys stand in – no names because it wasn't their fault – and we could tell straight away that this was applying a straightener to the normally unruly quiff that was the band. It was also sucking the essence of the band out. Anyway, it's a sorry little interlude that I should draw the curtain on. The sessions were scrapped and we were allowed to be The Triffids again.|$|E
500|$|Actor James Anderson {{was cast}} as Oliver. Before {{assuming}} the role, he shadowed a real F1 doctor on ward rounds – an experience he found difficult. [...] "We were approaching beds {{in which people}} were waking up from heart attacks and coming around quite distressed sometimes. It was really difficult {{to be there with}} a patient. It's harder than you think and I got quite emotional." [...] Anderson underwent such extensive training with the programme's medical advisors that he jested in June2009, [...] "If I started medical training <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> probably graduate as a doctor coming out of the show!" [...] The actor experienced [...] "an extended period of anxiety" [...] upon joining the series, and recalls: [...] "It took me about six months to have any sense {{of what was going on}} and then the second six months to feel comfortable [...] but only because it's such a well-oiled machine. You're coming in as a little cog, so you have to discover how to work in that and that takes a while." ...|$|E
500|$|Astonishing Stories is not {{remembered as}} {{being among the}} best science fiction magazines: both critic Peter Nicholls and sf writer Jack Williamson have {{described}} it as a [...] "training ground" [...] for writers who would go on to do their best work elsewhere. [...] However, Nicholls adds that [...] "its stories were surprisingly good considering how little was paid for them", and Wolf and Thompson agree, claiming that [...] "there was much that was memorable in Astonishing, both by way of immediate appeal and of more lasting quality". [...] Pohl himself, who later became a very successful magazine editor, felt he made many mistakes. [...] He quotes as an example his serialization of Malcolm Jameson's story [...] "Quicksands of Youthwardness" [...] in three parts; the story was only 27,000 words long, and readers complained (justifiably, in Pohl's view) that serializing it in a bimonthly magazine meant they had to wait for five months to read the whole story, in relatively small 9,000-word pieces. [...] Overall, Pohl assessed his performance by saying [...] "I wasn't really a very good editor"; adding [...] "With what I know <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have made those magazines sing, but as it was they just lay there".|$|E

2500|$|While many of {{her books}} were best sellers, critics were most appreciative of her murder mysteries. Rinehart, in The Circular Staircase (1908), is {{credited}} with inventing the [...] "Had-I-But-Known" [...] school of mystery writing. In The Circular Staircase [...] "a middle-aged spinster is persuaded by her niece and nephew to rent a country house for the summer. The gentle, peace-loving trio is plunged {{into a series of}} crimes solved {{with the help of the}} aunt." [...] The Had-I-But-Known mystery novel is one where the principal character (frequently female) does things in connection with a crime that have the effect of prolonging the action of the novel. Ogden Nash parodied the school in his poem Don't Guess Let Me Tell You: [...] "Sometimes the Had I But Known then what I know <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have saved at least three lives by revealing to the Inspector the conversation I heard through that fortuitous hole in the floor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some time later, Bree and Rex visit Andrew at the camp. Andrew asks to see {{his father}} alone; Bree thinks this is because he blames her for sending him to the camp and storms into the meeting room to tell him she did the right thing. There, Rex reveals that Andrew {{wanted to see him}} alone because he fears he is gay. Bree is horrified, and despite Rex's misgivings, insists Andrew come home with them immediately, saying [...] "Our son just told us that he might be gay. There are two hundred other boys in this camp. <b>Now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> explain to you what might happen if we left him here, but I'm a lady and I don't use that kind of language." [...] Rex reminds her that he is still her son and Bree tries to comfort Andrew by telling him [...] "I would love you even if you were a murderer".|$|E

2500|$|At Olivia's {{first meeting}} with [...] "Cesario" [...] (Viola) in I.V she asks her [...] "Are you a comedian?" [...] (an Elizabethan term for [...] "actor"). Viola's reply, [...] "I am not that I play", epitomising her {{adoption}} {{of the role of}} Cesario, is regarded as one of several references to theatricality and [...] "playing" [...] within the play. The plot against Malvolio revolves around these ideas, and Fabian remarks in Act III, Scene iv: [...] "If this were play'd upon a stage <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> condemn it as an improbable fiction". In Act IV, Scene ii, Feste (The Fool) plays both parts in the [...] "play" [...] for Malvolio's benefit, alternating between adopting the voice of the local curate, Sir Topas, and his own voice. He finishes by likening himself to [...] "the old Vice" [...] of English Morality plays. Other influences of the English folk tradition can be seen in Feste's songs and dialogue, such as his final song in Act V. The last line of this song, [...] "And we'll strive to please you every day", is a direct echo of similar lines from several English folk plays.|$|E
2500|$|Republican candidates, running {{concurrently}} {{with the}} 1964 federal election, were {{undermined by the}} unpopularity of Barry Goldwater, the Republican challenger for the US Presidency, {{and the leader of}} their political ticket. Not long before election day, Goldwater scheduled a visit to Las Vegas. Laxalt's advisors told him he should [...] "duck" [...] Goldwater as they feared any association with the Arizona Senator would spell trouble. Laxalt, who often described Goldwater as his [...] "political Godfather", reportedly told his aides, [...] "Listen, Barry Goldwater is my friend. If I snubbed him <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never look him in the face again. I would rather lose." [...] The Laxalt-Goldwater meeting on the tarmac was splashed on the front pages of local newspapers. (Goldwater lost Nevada by 28,000 votes.) [...] Still, the Laxalt-Cannon race remained far closer than expected. As he watched the returns come in from his home in Carson City, Laxalt was stunned when one of the television networks actually declared him the winner. The next morning he flew to Las Vegas where he was told that certain precincts reported late and that Cannon had won by 48 votes. [...] The race was the subject of intense controversy for years.|$|E
2500|$|Tommy Lee of Mötley Crüe fame played drums on [...] "Meet the Creeper" [...] and [...] "The Ballad of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore". Due {{to various}} {{personal}} and legal struggles, Lee {{was living in}} the studio for a time during the recording of the album. Humphrey was a good friend of Lee's, and had previously worked with his band prior to the production of Hellbilly Deluxe. Zombie later asked Lee to appear on the album, with Lee agreeing to do so. On the collaboration, Lee stated [...] "I went to his house after I got out of jail to stay for a while, and I think I was there about a day or two and they were working on the record downstairs and Scott and Rob were like, 'Dude, Tommy’s upstairs, we should ask him to play.' And they asked me to play and I was like, 'I would love to play right <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> really use ... you know, just kind of check out, really do some music' and I ended up playing like four tracks or so on the record." [...] Lee is credited as the drummer for [...] "Meet the Creeper" [...] and [...] "The Ballad of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore". [...] "Meet the Creeper" [...] was originally referred to as [...] "Creature Core" [...] prior to the release of the album. Danny Lohner provided additional guitar recordings for [...] "Meet the Creeper". Zombie recorded a song titled [...] "Wish It Away" [...] for the album, though it was not included on the final product.|$|E
