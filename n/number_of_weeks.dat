It was named HMS Buzzard and n renamed HMS Daedalus II three months later, before being {{transferred}} to the Royal Air Force in May 1940. During the war Lympne was a front-line fighter base, RAF Lympne. It was heavily bombed during the Battle of Britain in 1940 and put out of action for a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks.</b> It {{was too close to}} the coast {{to be used as a}} squadron base, but squadrons were detached there on a day-to-day basis.

5|$|Despite {{the legal}} action, {{pre-production}} towards Bond 17 still progressed, with some early details unveiled at the Cannes Film Festival {{which took place}} in May 1990. However, delays occurred because of the ongoing legal action with MGM/UA and, in an August 1993 interview, Dalton revealed that Michael France was involved in writing a script for the next Bond film, with Anthony Hopkins as a potential villain, adding that Hopkins had been in discussions with Eon for a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks.</b> Dalton also stated that the earliest production could begin would be in January or February 1994. Dalton's six-year contract expired in 1993, and after reading France's script for what would become GoldenEye, he announced on 12 April 1994 {{that he would not be}} returning to play Bond; he was replaced by Pierce Brosnan. After Michael France delivered the original screenplay, Jeffrey Caine was brought in to rework much of the material. Kevin Wade was also brought into the process before Bruce Feirstein gave the final polish to the script.|$|E

He was offered a new contract by Queens Park Rangers, but he was keen to return to northern England and cut short his summer holiday in Tenerife to sign for the West Yorkshire club on a two-year contract. His contract with Leeds began on 1 July 2004, and he made his debut for the club in the 1–1 draw with Nottingham Forest on 21 August. He scored his first goal for Leeds two matches later, netting the first goal in the team's 3–0 victory against Coventry City. He was a regular in the team {{during the first half}} of the season, playing in every match from the start of September until the end of November. However, he then experienced another major injury set-back, tearing his ankle ligaments during the 1–0 defeat to Rotherham United on 29 November 2004, an injury which left him out of action for a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E

5|$|Instead, Johnson {{was given}} another chance with Chester City, {{with whom he}} trained in the run up {{to the start of}} the 2008–09 season. He scored in a {{friendly}} against an Everton reserve team, but despite the club wanting to sign Johnson, the transfer was put on hold because of the club's salary cap. Johnson had to wait a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> to sign for Chester, after a deal to take Paul Rutherford to Northwich Victoria, freeing up money to pay Johnson, failed to go through before the 2008 summer transfer deadline closed. Johnson finally signed for Chester on 15 October, agreeing a two-year contract with his hometown club. His debut came three days later in a home game with Port Vale, with Chester losing 2–1, when he had two opportunities to score and was substituted late in the second half. His first goal for Chester was a consolation goal in a 2–1 defeat to Morecambe on 15 November. He missed four weeks out through injury, which coincided with the club's improvement in form under new manager Mark Wright, until he returned as a last-minute substitute against his former side Bradford City.|$|E

Morrison returned again on July 25 episode of Raw, attacking R-Truth. At SummerSlam, Morrison competed in a six-man tag team match, teaming with Kofi Kingston and Rey Mysterio to defeat R-Truth, Alberto Del Rio and The Miz. The following night on Raw, Morrison defeated R-Truth in a Falls Count Anywhere match to end their feud. At Night of Champions, Morrison competed in a Fatal-4-Way match for the WWE United States Championship, also involving Alex Riley, Jack Swagger and Dolph Ziggler, with the latter of whom successfully retaining his title. Morrison then challenged Cody Rhodes for the Intercontinental Championship twice; first on the September 26 episode of Raw in a 10 man battle royal and later in a singles match at the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view, but lost on both occasions. Following this, Morrison went on a losing streak, lasting a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks.</b> On the November 7 episode of Raw, Morrison picked up his first victory in three months, defeating United States Champion Dolph Ziggler in a non-title match. He then challenged Ziggler for the championship at Survivor Series in a losing effort.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the 2012–13 season, May went {{on trial}} with League Two club Gillingham, {{training}} {{with the club}} for a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> and playing in several pre-season friendlies. However, no move materialised, and May signed for Conference South side Dover Athletic on a free transfer on 8 August 2012. May made his competitive debut for Dover in a 2–2 away draw against Sutton United on 21 August 2012, coming on as an 86th-minute substitute. He made his first start four days later as Dover defeated AFC Hornchurch 1–0 at Hornchurch Stadium, before scoring his first goal for the club in a 3–1 away win at Eastleigh on 1 September. May went on to score in seven consecutive games running from September to November, five of which {{in the league and}} a further two in the FA Cup, subsequently taking his goal tally for the season to eight. Goals in convincing victories over Weston-super-Mare and Truro City took May's goal count into double figures. He ended the year with a run of five goals in three matches, scoring braces in wins against Eastleigh and Hayes & Yeading United, as well as scoring a late consolation strike in a 2–1 defeat to Tonbridge Angels on 26 December 2012. It took May a month to get off the mark {{at the start of the}} new year, controlling the ball and scoring on the turn in a 3–2 win over Welling United at the Crabble Athletic Ground on 9 February 2013. He scored four times in March 2013, subsequently taking his tally for the season to over 20 goals – the first time May had reached this milestone in his career. He scored two further times during the regular season, in away victories against Chelmsford City and Staines Town. Dover finished the season in third place, meaning they would play fourth placed Eastleigh in the two legged play-off semi-finals. May scored a dipping volley as Dover took a 3–1 lead in the first leg, controlling the ball on his chest with his back to goal, turning and hitting the ball from 25-yards past Ross Flitney in the Eastleigh goal. Dover progressed to the final, but lost 3–2 to Salisbury City after extra-time, with May playing in all three play-off matches. During his one season at Dover, May finished the season as the club's top goalscorer, scoring 24 times in 45 matches.|$|E

5|$|Wilson {{began his}} career as a trainee with Charlton Athletic, and was a regular in the club's Under-18 team, where he played in defence. He progressed through the club's youth system, and {{featured}} in Charlton's reserve side throughout the club's 2005–06 campaign, making a total of 16 appearances for the reserve side as a second-year scholar. However, he failed to make any first-team appearances and was subsequently allowed to search for a new club. In February 2006, he played for Luton Town's reserve side in a match against Stevenage Borough reserves at Kenilworth Road, although no transfer materialised. He was officially released by Charlton in April 2006. A month later, Wilson went on trial at League Two side Shrewsbury Town, and played the whole match in Shrewsbury's 2–1 pre-season friendly home win against Rotherham United, although he was unsuccessful in his attempt to earn a professional contract with the club. In August 2006, Wilson signed a one-year deal with Colchester United. Similarly to his time at Charlton, Wilson featured regularly for the club's reserve side throughout the 2006–07 season, but failed to make any first-team appearances, making the substitute's bench once in a 1–0 loss to MK Dons in the League Cup. He was loaned out to Conference South side Welling United in December 2006. He made his debut for Welling in the club's 1–0 win away at Cambridge City, but was sent-off after just 27 minutes for violent conduct. He returned to first-team action in Welling's 0–0 draw with Basingstoke Town at Park View Road in the FA Trophy, and also played the whole match in Welling's 2–1 away win against Thurrock. Wilson played his last game for Welling in the club's 2–0 win at home to Fisher Athletic in early January 2007. He played a total of four times for Welling during his one-month loan spell at the club. On returning to Layer Road, Wilson was released at the end of the 2006–07 season, and failed to make a first-team appearance for Colchester. Ahead of the 2007–08 season, Wilson spent pre-season trialling at Brentford and Stockport County respectively, training with Stockport for a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> and playing in several pre-season friendlies, but was ultimately not offered a contract.|$|E
