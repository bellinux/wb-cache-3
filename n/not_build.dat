5|$|In {{all species}} {{copulation}} {{takes place at}} the nest site; it begins shortly after pairing and continues for 3–10days before egg-laying. The male brings the nesting material, in ground-nesting species (which may <b>not</b> <b>build</b> a nest) sometimes in the pouch, and in tree-nesting species crosswise in the bill. The female then heaps the material up to form a simple structure.|$|E

5|$|Adult {{males are}} less ready to pursue and less {{efficient}} at catching than adult females, especially against larger prey. Males are quite effective against small web spiders, and reluctant to tackle large ones although they catch them in about 50% of attempts. Against other jumping spiders, males do not pursue large ones and pursue about 48% of small ones, catching 84% of those they pursue. Males of Portia do <b>not</b> <b>build</b> large webs for catching prey ("capture webs").|$|E
5|$|Complex nests {{are built}} by many ant species, but other species are nomadic and do <b>not</b> <b>build</b> {{permanent}} structures. Ants may form subterranean nests or build them on trees. These nests {{may be found}} in the ground, under stones or logs, inside logs, hollow stems, or even acorns. The materials used for construction include soil and plant matter, and ants carefully select their nest sites; Temnothorax albipennis will avoid sites with dead ants, as these may indicate the presence of pests or disease. They are quick to abandon established nests {{at the first sign of}} threats.|$|E
5|$|Greater yellow-headed {{vultures}} do <b>not</b> <b>build</b> nests, {{but rather}} {{lay their eggs}} directly on cliffs, the floors of caves, the ground, or in the hollows of stumps. Eggs are cream-colored and blotched with brown spots, particularly around the larger end. Clutch size ranges from one to three, though two is the norm. The chicks are altricial—blind, naked and relatively immobile upon hatching, and grow down feathers later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. Young fledge after two to three months.|$|E

5|$|Hess did <b>not</b> <b>build</b> a {{power base}} or develop a coterie of followers. He was {{motivated}} by his loyalty to Hitler {{and a desire to}} be useful to him; he did not seek power or prestige or take advantage of his position to accumulate personal wealth. He lived in a modest house in Munich. Although Hess had less influence than other top NSDAP officials, he was popular with the masses. After the Invasion of Poland and the start of World War II in September 1939, Hitler made Hess second in line to succeed him, after Hermann Göring. Around the same time, Hitler appointed Hess's chief of staff, Martin Bormann, as his personal secretary, a post formerly held by Hess.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to ion pumps, ion channels do <b>not</b> <b>build</b> chemical gradients but rather dissipate {{them in order}} to perform work or send a signal. Probably the most familiar and best studied example is the voltage-gated Na+ channel, which allows conduction of an action potential along neurons. All ion pumps have some sort of trigger or “gating” mechanism. In the previous example it was electrical bias, but other channels can be activated by binding a molecular agonist or through a conformational change in another nearby protein.|$|E
5|$|In precocial species, {{the mothers}} invest little in nest {{building}} {{and some do}} <b>not</b> <b>build</b> nests at all. The female gives birth standing and the young emerge behind her. Mothers of these species maintain contact with their highly mobile young with maternal contact calls. Though relatively independent and weaned within days, precocial young may continue to nurse and be groomed by their mothers. Rodent litter sizes also vary and females with smaller litters {{spend more time in}} the nest than those with larger litters.|$|E

5|$|It was legislated in 1966 to run {{parallel}} to the New Jersey Turnpike from exit 13 until North Avenue, where it would turn northwest and intersect U.S. Route 1/9 near the airport. The routing was eventually shifted to begin from a new interchange along the New Jersey Turnpike. A total of $50 million in funding was allocated for {{the road and the}} Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was responsible for designing the road. The state had wanted the port authority to pay for construction; however it was ruled that they could <b>not</b> <b>build</b> the road. Construction on Route 81 took place between 1979 and 1982.|$|E
5|$|Lesser yellow-headed {{vultures}} do <b>not</b> <b>build</b> nests, {{but rather}} lay eggs on the ground, cliff ledges, the floors of caves, {{or in the}} hollow of a tree. Eggs are cream colored and heavily blotched with brown and gray spots, particularly around the larger end. Two eggs are generally laid. The chicks are altricial—they are blind, naked and relatively immobile upon hatching. The chicks do not grow their down feathers until later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. Young fledge after two to three months.|$|E
5|$|M.regularis {{is found}} in the {{south-western}} coastal regions, inhabiting eucalypt woodland and open forests. They nest underground and do <b>not</b> <b>build</b> mounds. Workers are active during the day and night, foraging on trees in search for prey and sweet substances such as sap and nectar. The larvae are strictly carnivorous and only eat insects that workers capture. Nuptial flight occurs around February to April, with queens shedding their wings inside the nest and mating near to their parent nest. Queens tend to look for food for their young before they hatch, taking as long as eight months to develop. Certain frog species are known to dwell inside M.regularis colonies.|$|E

5|$|Spiders are chelicerates, which {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into only two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen. Jumping spiders have a distinctive rectangular carapace. All spiders' abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of silk glands within their abdomen. The cephalothorax and abdomen are joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel, which allows the abdomen to move while spinning silk. While most jumping spiders do <b>not</b> <b>build</b> webs to catch prey, they use silk for other purposes, including moulting and laying eggs.|$|E
5|$|The Holden Volt is {{available}} to purchase through 49 select Holden dealerships throughout metropolitan and rural Australia, with 18 in Victoria, 11 in New South Wales, 9 in Queensland, 7 in Western Australia and 4 in South Australia.

A total of 246 Holden Volts had been sold in the country by mid April 2015, with the stock {{of the first generation}} almost empty.

NASA's Space Shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the Space Shuttle Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21, 2011.
