5|$|The <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> <b>crocodile</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by the American herpetologist Karl Patterson Schmidt in 1928 as Crocodylus novaeguineae. At one time {{it was thought that}} there were two subspecies, C. n. novaeguineae, the <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> <b>crocodile</b> native to Papua New Guinea and Western New Guinea, and C. n. mindorensis, the Philippine crocodile, native to several islands including Busuanga, Luzon, Masbate, Mindoro, Negros, Samar and Mindanao. Most authorities now consider that the Philippine crocodile is an entirely separate species. DNA sequencing data reported in 2011 showed that the Philippine crocodile is, in part, paraphyletic with regard to the <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> <b>crocodile,</b> and that the latter may constitutes a population within the Philippine crocodile. Among their two samples for the <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> <b>crocodile,</b> one was part of the Philippine crocodile clade and the other was separate, estimated to have diverged 2.6–6.8 million years ago. Both samples were taken from captives (could potentially be misidentified or hybrids) and the result should therefore be treated with caution.|$|E
25|$|The {{saltwater}} crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) {{is the largest}} reptile native to New Guinea. It is a widely distributed species, from eastern India to northern Australia. It is found in most of New Guinea's rivers, except for those heavily disturbed by humans, or too small to accommodate the species. The other crocodile native to New Guinea, the <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus novaeguineae), is an endemic. It is {{much smaller than the}} {{saltwater crocodile}}. A separate species may occur in southern New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|<b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> <b>crocodiles</b> have {{a mostly}} aquatic {{lifestyle}} and are largely nocturnal. They {{spend much of}} the day underwater, often with their nostrils and eyes above the surface. Powerful side-to-side movements of their tails propel them through the water and they use both tail and legs to steer. When on land, they favour shady, dense areas of undergrowth. They tend to bask in a group during the day, dispersing at night to feed.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} or {{possibly}} four adult saltwater crocodiles living in Vanuatu's mangroves and no current breeding population. It is said the crocodiles reached {{the northern part}} of the islands after cyclones, given the island chain's proximity to the Solomon Islands and <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> where <b>crocodiles</b> are very common.|$|R
5|$|This {{crocodile}} is to {{be found}} in the freshwater swamps, marshes and lakes of <b>New</b> <b>Guinea,</b> particularly in the interior. It has been known to enter brackish waters such as those of the Fly River estuary but is very rare in coastal areas, and never found in the presence of the competing saltwater crocodile (C. porosus). The animal was first described from the Sepik River area in the north of Papua <b>New</b> <b>Guinea.</b> A separate population is found in the southern half of the island, with a range that extends from southeastern Papua <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> to the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua. It is separated from the northern population by the <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> Highlands, a mountain range that runs along the centre of the island. DNA analysis has revealed these to be genetically separate populations, and there are some differences in their morphology and behavior. There are estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000 <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> <b>crocodiles</b> in the wild.|$|R
25|$|In {{northern}} Australia (which {{includes the}} northernmost {{parts of the}} Northern Territory, Western Australia, and Queensland), the saltwater crocodile is thriving, particularly in the multiple river systems near Darwin such as the Adelaide, Mary, and Daly Rivers, along with their adjacent billabongs and estuaries. The saltwater crocodile population in Australia is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000 adults. In Australia, the species coexists with the smaller, narrow-snouted Johnston's or freshwater crocodile (C. johnstoni). Their range extends from Broome in Western Australia through the entire Northern Territory coast all the way south to Rockhampton in Queensland. The Alligator Rivers in the Arnhem Land region are misnamed due to the resemblance of the saltwater crocodile to alligators as compared to freshwater crocodiles, which also inhabit the Northern Territory. In New Guinea, they are also common, existing within the coastal reaches of virtually every river system in the country, such as the Fly River, along with all estuaries and mangroves, where they overlap in range but rarely in actuality or habitat with the rarer, less aggressive <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> <b>crocodile</b> (C. novaeguineae). They are also present in varying numbers throughout the Bismarck Archipelago, the Kai Islands, the Aru Islands, the Maluku Islands and many other islands within the region, including Timor, and most islands within the Torres Strait.|$|E
500|$|The <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> <b>crocodile</b> {{grows to}} {{a length of}} up to [...] for males and [...] for females, {{although}} most specimens are smaller. The body ranges from grey to brown in colour, with darker bandings on the tail and body which become less noticeable as the animal grows. Longitudinal ridges {{in front of the}} eyes and some granular scales {{on the back of the}} neck between four large scales are distinctive features of this species. There are some differences between the northerly and southerly populations in the morphology of the skull and the arrangement of the scales. The snout is pointed and relatively narrow during juvenile stages and becomes wider as the animal matures. The <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> <b>crocodile</b> bears a physical similarity to the nearby Philippine crocodile (C. mindorensis) and Siamese crocodile (C. siamensis). The colouring is similar to that of the freshwater crocodile (Crocodylus johnsoni) of northern Australia, but the snout is somewhat shorter and broader.|$|E
500|$|The <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> <b>{{crocodile}}</b> (Crocodylus novaeguineae) {{is a small}} {{species of}} crocodile found {{on the island of}} New Guinea where there are two geographically isolated populations to the north and south of the mountain ridge that runs along the centre of the island. In the past it included the Philippine crocodile, C. n. mindorensis, as a subspecies, but today they are regarded as separate species. The habitat of the <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> <b>crocodile</b> is mostly freshwater swamps and lakes. It is most active at night when it feeds on fish and a range of other small animals. A female crocodile lays a clutch of eggs in a nest composed of vegetation and she lies up nearby to guard the nest. There is some degree of parental care for newly hatched juveniles. This crocodile was over-hunted for its valuable skin in the mid 20th century, but conservation measures have since been put in place, it is reared in ranches and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists it as being of [...] "Least Concern".|$|E
500|$|Adult {{and young}} <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> <b>crocodiles</b> have {{a range of}} vocalisations. An adult female can produce a {{repeated}} throaty [...] "roar" [...] when approached by another adult. The young start communicating with each other while still in the egg; this may help synchronise hatching. Newly hatched juveniles use various yelps and grunts. When startled, a warning sound emitted by one will send all the juveniles diving {{to the bottom of the}} water. Adults in the vicinity respond with growls, threats, and attacks. The distress noises of a youngster when handled at a ranching facility was observed to cause all the larger animals to become involved in frenzied activity, with some rushing towards the juvenile and others thrashing about in the water and slapping their heads down on the surface.|$|R
500|$|The genus name Crocodylus {{comes from}} the Greek kroko which means a pebble and deilos, a worm or man, {{referring}} to the knobbly appearance of the dorsal surface of the reptile. The specific epithet novaeguineae is from the Latin and means [...] "of New Guinea". Other common names for this <b>crocodile</b> include <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> freshwater <b>crocodile,</b> Singapore large grain, Puk Puk, Buaya air tawar and Wahne huala.|$|R
5|$|Vocalisations are {{frequent}} as the juveniles disperse, {{and again as}} they congregate in the morning. Nearby adults, presumably the parents, also give signals warning of predators or alerting the youngsters {{to the presence of}} food. The range and quantity of vocalisations vary between species. Alligators are the noisiest, while some crocodile species are almost completely silent. Adult female <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> <b>crocodiles</b> and Siamese crocodiles roar when approached by another adult, while Nile crocodiles grunt or bellow in a similar situation. The American alligator is exceptionally noisy; it emits a series of about seven throaty bellows, each a couple of seconds long, at ten second intervals. It also makes various grunts and hisses. Males create vibrations in the water to send out infrasonic signals that serve to attract females and intimidate rivals. The enlarged boss of the male gharial may serve as a sound resonator.|$|R
500|$|The {{skin of the}} <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> <b>crocodile</b> is {{valuable}} and in the 1950s and 1960s the animals in the northern population were heavily hunted {{to a point where}} they might have become extinct. Around 1970, legislation was put in place and they received some protection. In the period 1977 to 1980, the harvest of wild skins was over 20,000 per year but in the 1980s this declined to 12,000 to 20,000. As well as this, some 2,500 to 10,000 eggs and hatchlings were collected annually to raise on ranches. However, in 1995, the largest ranch on the island initiated a change of strategy to concentrate on raising the saltwater crocodile, and demand for the eggs and juveniles of the <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> <b>crocodile</b> dried up. Since then, cropping of wild animals has been controlled in both Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. In the former it is limited to a belly width of [...] for wet skins and in the latter to salted skins with a belly width of [...] Some eggs and hatchlings are still removed from the nest and raised in enclosures and a similar programme has more recently been initiated for southern populations.|$|E

5|$|Newly hatched <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> <b>crocodiles</b> feed on aquatic insects, spiders, tadpoles, {{freshwater}} snails, frogs, {{fish and}} small mammals. As they grow, {{so does the}} size of their prey and their consumption of fish rises, but they still will eat anything of a worthwhile size that they can find. An adult's diet is largely fish, caught by sweeping the snout sideways and snapping at the prey, but also includes shrimps, crabs, frogs, snakes, birds and medium-sized mammals. A crocodile catches its prey by stealth with a flick of its head, impaling it with its sharp teeth and gripping and crushing it. The jaws cannot move sideways to chew the food; instead, the crocodile's head is tossed to move the prey {{to the back of the}} mouth before the prey is swallowed whole. This crocodile is surprisingly agile and can lunge its body upward into the air to catch bats, flying birds, and leaping fish. It can also probe into the mud at the bottom of a river or swamp with its snout to search for crabs and molluscs.|$|R
