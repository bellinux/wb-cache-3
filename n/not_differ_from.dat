Wipeout gameplay takes inspiration from Formula One parallels; rather than using aerodynamics to increase wheel grip by down-force for faster turning speeds, Wipeout uses a fictionalised method of air braking for ever greater turning force.|$|E

5|$|Amarte Es un Placer debuted {{at number}} one in Spain, and on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart in the United States. It was {{certified}} gold in the United States, and achieved multi-platinum status in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Spain. The album has sold over three million copies as of 2007. On its release, the record received mixed reviews from music critics; several critics praised {{the production of the}} disc as well as Miguel's vocals and the compositions, while others felt it did <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> his earlier recordings and found the music outdated. Miguel received several accolades, including a Grammy nomination for Best Latin Pop Performance and the Latin Grammy Awards for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangular}} {{spots of}} the spotted green pigeon {{are not unique}} among pigeons, but are also seen in the spot-winged pigeon (Columba maculosa) and the speckled pigeon (C. guinea), and {{are the result of}} lack of melanin deposition during development. The yellow-buff coloured spots are very worn, while less worn feathers have white tips; this indicates that the former were stained during life or represent a different stage of plumage, and that the latter were fresher. The plumage of the spotted green pigeon was distinct in being very soft compared to that of other pigeons, perhaps due to the body feathers being proportionally long. The hackles were not as elongated as those of the Nicobar pigeon, and the feathers did <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> those of other pigeons in their microstructure. The plumage was also distinct in being very pigmented, except for the tips of the feathers, and even the down was dark, unlike that of most other birds (a feature otherwise seen in aberrant plumage).|$|E

5|$|Limited {{knowledge}} of the taxonomy, biogeography and natural history of deep sea communities prevents accurate assessment {{of the risk of}} species extinctions from large-scale mining. Data acquired from the abyssal North Pacific and North Atlantic suggest that deep-sea ecosystems may be adversely affected by mining operations on decadal time scales. In 1978, a dredge aboard the Hughes Glomar Explorer, operated by the American mining consortium Ocean Minerals Company (OMCO), made a mining track at a depth of 5000meters in the nodule fields of the CCFZ. In 2004, the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea (IFREMER) conducted the Nodinaut expedition to this mining track (which is still visible on the seabed) to study the long-term effects of this physical disturbance on the sediment and its benthic fauna. Samples taken of the superficial sediment revealed that its physical and chemical properties had not shown any recovery since the disturbance made 26 years earlier. On the other hand, the biological activity measured in the track by instruments aboard the manned submersible bathyscaphe Nautile did <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> a nearby unperturbed site. This data suggests that the benthic fauna and nutrient fluxes at the water–sediment interface has fully recovered.|$|E

25|$|However, {{these numbers}} are very nearly the same, due to the much larger mass of the proton, about 1836.1 times {{the mass of the}} {{electron}}, so that the reduced mass in the system is the mass of the electron multiplied by the constant 1836.1/(1+1836.1) = 0.99946. This fact was historically important in convincing Rutherford of the importance of Bohr's model, for it explained the fact that the frequencies of lines in the spectra for singly ionized helium do <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> those of hydrogen by a factor of exactly 4, but rather by 4 times the ratio of the reduced mass for the hydrogen vs. the helium systems, which was much closer to the experimental ratio than exactly 4.|$|E
25|$|Nest {{activity}} is episodic and occurs in bursts rather than continuous activity throughout the day. Polistes instabilis spends {{roughly half of}} the daylight hours inactive and immobile. Periods of inactivity are broken when individuals initiate actions such as arriving, leaving, walking, antennating, gaster wagging, or fanning. These actions cause other workers to also begin working. 80% of {{activity is}} initiated by arriving or walking. Arriving triggers activity because when wasps arrive to the nest they bring materials to transfer to other workers. Walking {{is a first step}} taken in assessing needs of the colony, which can then be communicated to others. Queens do <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> other workers in the initiation of active periods.|$|E

25|$|A {{systematic}} {{review of the}} risk of major birth defects in antidepressant-exposed pregnancies found a small increase (3% to 24%) in the risk of major malformations and a risk of cardiovascular birth defects that did <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> non-exposed pregnancies. A study of fluoxetine-exposed pregnancies found a 12% increase in the risk of major malformations that just missed statistical significance. Other studies have found an increased risk of cardiovascular birth defects among depressed mothers not undergoing SSRI treatment, suggesting the possibility of ascertainment bias, e.g. that worried mothers may pursue more aggressive testing of their infants. Another study found no increase in cardiovascular birth defects and a 27% increased risk of major malformations in SSRI exposed pregnancies. The FDA advises for the risk of birth defects with the use of paroxetine and the MAOI should be avoided.|$|E
25|$|While {{the rate}} of {{domestic}} violence among immigrant groups does <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> that of the general population, immigrant {{victims of domestic violence}} may face additional challenges. While victims can be of either gender, women may be especially vulnerable. The process of immigrating to another country and adjusting to American culture can be stressful, increasing the likelihood of domestic violence. Factors such as limited English language ability, legal status, and lack of social ties may create additional barriers for those trying to escape such situations. Even when a woman does have access to social services that could help her escape an abusive situation, cultural norms may make it difficult for her to leave. If a woman decides to leave an abusive spouse she may run the risk of social ostracism and of bringing shame to her family. Thus, a woman may choose to stay and suffer abuse rather than face the social consequences of leaving her husband.|$|E

500|$|The mindstate {{described}} in the above interview rules the content on the album, as the lyrics are loaded with violent narratives and braggadocio and little else, as Buckshot and 5ft try to solidify their status in rap. Allmusic's Chris Witt stated that [...] "Emcees Buckshot and 5ft Accelerator attack their verses with an aggressive nihilism not heard since Kool G Rap's peak." [...] 5ft, originally known as 5FT Accelerator, [...] appears on three tracks here, and his lyrical content does <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> that of Buckshot's. Unlike later work by New York City peers like Nas, the lyrical content found here does not peer deeply into social issues or provide much substance.

500|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} as Scutiger subrubescens by American mycologist William Murrill in 1940, based on collections {{that he found}} growing under oak near Gainesville, Florida, in November 1938. In 1947 he transferred it to the genus Polyporus. Josiah Lincoln Lowe examined Murrill's type material and thought that it did <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> Albatrellus confluens. In 1965, Zdeněk Pouzar made collections from Bohemia (now the Czech Republic), and {{described it as a}} new species (Albatrellus similis), unaware of the similarity to Murrill's Florida specimens. Further study revealed that A.similis was identical to Murrill's Scutiger subrubescens, and Pouzar transferred the latter epithet to Albatrellus. In 1974, Pouzar recognized that Lowe's species Albatrellus confluens was distinct from A.subrubescens. The specific epithet subrubescens, [...] "tinted reddish", is derived from the Latin words sub ("less than") and rubescens ("growing red").|$|E
