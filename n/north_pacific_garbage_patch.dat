40|$|The {{population}} in the Pacific Islands region is vastly dependant on their oceanic resources, for food, protection and economic income. Today the Pacific Ocean faces many threats that could risk the living hood of its population. This study aims to map the extent of plastic pollution in the South Pacific and possible measurements against it. The study will also be focused on plastic shopping bags and try to assess the most environmentally friendly option. This will be achieved by literature reviews, personal interviews and experimental studies. The {{results showed that the}} pollution is of the same magnitude that in the more commonly known <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Garbage</b> <b>Patch</b> and may affect the ecosystems by killing animals as well as transporting environmental pollutants through the food web and invasive species through oceans. Much is still unknown about the affects of microplastics and further studies are needed. Main focus should be to stop the plastic pollution at the source, for example by levying plastic bags and only allowing completely compostable bags. ...|$|E
40|$|Marine plastic {{pollution}} is an ever-increasing problem that demands immediate mitigation and reduction plans. Here, a model based on satellite-tracked buoy observations and scaled {{to a large}} data set of observations on microplastic from surface trawls was used to simulate the transport of plastics floating on the ocean surface from 2015 to 2025, with the goal to assess the optimal marine microplastic removal locations for two scenarios: removing the most surface microplastic and reducing the impact on ecosystems, using plankton growth as a proxy. The simulations show that the optimal removal locations are primarily located {{off the coast of}} China and in the Indonesian Archipelago for both scenarios. Our estimates show that 31 % of the modeled microplastic mass can be removed by 2025 using 29 plastic collectors operating at a 45 % capture efficiency from these locations, compared to only 17 % when the 29 plastic collectors are moored in the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>garbage</b> <b>patch,</b> between Hawaii and California. The overlap of ocean surface microplastics and phytoplankton growth can be reduced by 46 % at our proposed locations, while sinks in the North Pacific can only reduce the overlap by 14 %. These results are an indication that oceanic plastic removal might be more effective in removing a greater microplastic mass and in reducing potential harm to marine life when closer to shore than inside the plastic accumulation zones in the centers of the gyres...|$|E

50|$|The Southern <b>Pacific</b> <b>Garbage</b> <b>Patch</b> {{is an area}} of {{elevated}} levels of marine debris and plastic particle pollution, most of which is concentrated within the ocean's pelagic zone. It is located within the South Pacific Gyre, which itself spans from waters east of Australia to the South American continent, as far north as the Equator, and south until reaching the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The degredation of plastics in the ocean also leads to a rise in the level of toxins in the area. This <b>garbage</b> <b>patch</b> is the most recently discovered having only been confirmed in mid-2017.

50|$|Through {{a series}} of oceanic expeditions, The Ocean Cleanup is researching the total mass and the {{distribution}} of plastic debris in the oceans, as well as technically and economically feasible ocean plastic recycling methods, technologies and equipment. In August 2015, it conducted its so-called Mega Expedition, in which a fleet of approximately 30 vessels crossed the Great <b>Pacific</b> <b>garbage</b> <b>patch</b> using manta trawls to measure the concentration, spatial and size distribution of plastic there. Researchers aboard mothership R/V Ocean Starr reported sighting of much more large-sized plastic debris in the Great Pacific Ocean gyre than expected. According to The Ocean Cleanup website, this expedition was conducted in preparation for a large-scale cleanup of the Great <b>Pacific</b> <b>garbage</b> <b>patch,</b> which it intends to start in 2020.|$|R
50|$|It {{is thought}} that, like {{other areas of}} {{concentrated}} marine debris in the world's oceans, the Great <b>Pacific</b> <b>garbage</b> <b>patch</b> formed gradually {{as a result of}} ocean or marine pollution gathered by oceanic currents. The <b>garbage</b> <b>patch</b> occupies a large and relatively stationary region of the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean bound by the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Gyre (a remote area commonly referred to as the horse latitudes). The gyre's rotational pattern draws in waste material from across the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean, including coastal waters off North America and Japan. As material is captured in the currents, wind-driven surface currents gradually move floating debris toward the center, trapping it in the region.|$|R

50|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that fishing debris such as nets, buoys, and lines, accounts for a majority of plastic debris found in the oceans, such as in the Great <b>Pacific</b> <b>garbage</b> <b>patch.</b> Similarly, fishing debris {{has been shown to be}} a major source of plastic debris found on the shores of Korea.|$|R

50|$|To {{study the}} scale of the marine debris {{accumulation}} in the area, the Sea Education Association (SEA) has been doing extensive research on the Atlantic <b>Garbage</b> <b>Patch.</b> Nearly 700,000 students from the SEA semester program have been dragging 6,100 fine-mesh nets through the Atlantic over 22 years.

Researchers found high concentrations of marine debris accumulating in regions governed by ocean currents. Extrapolating from findings in the Sea of Japan, the researchers hypothesized that similar conditions would occur {{in other parts of}} the Pacific where prevailing currents were favorable to the creation of relatively stable waters. They specifically indicated the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Gyre.|$|R
