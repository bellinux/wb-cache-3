Those performances were rejected at the time and have been lost in the ensuing years."

In order to facilitate the theoretical studies on the computer performance management problem, an effective simulation environment is desired.

50|$|The {{following}} graph (<b>note</b> <b>log</b> scale) shows {{abundance of}} elements {{in our solar}} system. The table shows the twelve most common elements in our galaxy (estimated spectroscopically), as measured in parts per million, by mass.Nearby galaxies that have evolved along similar lines have a corresponding enrichment of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. The more distant galaxies are being viewed as they appeared in the past, so their abundances of elements appear closer to the primordial mixture. Since physical laws and processes are uniform throughout the universe, however, {{it is expected that}} these galaxies will likewise have evolved similar abundances of elements.|$|R

50|$|Cadamosto's patron, Prince Henry the Navigator, died in November 1460, and the {{monopoly}} on African trade reverted to the Portuguese crown and its operations were gradually transferred from Lagos to Lisbon. Probably seeing no future {{for himself in}} the new order, Cadamosto left Portugal and returned to Venice in February 1463. Cadamosto {{is believed to have}} brought <b>notes,</b> <b>logs</b> and several nautical maps with him. Cadamosto used these to compose his famous Navigationi sometime in the mid-1460s. The Navigazioni, besides generally hailing the Portuguese discoveries and lionizing Prince Henry, provided detailed accounts of three expeditions - his own voyages of 1455 and 1456, and the voyage of Pedro de Sintra in 1462. He is believed to have delivered much of his primary material to the Venetian cartographer Grazioso Benincasa, as Benincasa went on to produce an atlas in 1468, depicting the West African coast with remarkable accuracy.|$|R

30|$|On a final <b>note,</b> {{keystroke}} <b>logging</b> helps {{generate the}} quantitative data {{reported in this}} study. However, to achieve the level of details necessary for process research, extensive manual coding and tabulation is required to generate qualitative data in relation to text development, source use and revisions. However, as shown in this study, the approach, though intensively laborious, provides a new dimension of capturing and partially identifying differences in writers’ reading-into-writing processes.|$|R

30|$|The {{interview}} summaries included {{qualitative data}} (e.g. <b>notes</b> <b>logged</b> by interviewers) {{and provided the}} main data source for analysis. The analysis focused on item level results of each individual interview, and aggregated results across each round of interviews. Qualitative data of the practice round and round one were combined during analysis because no problems aside from word or format issues were encountered in the practice round. Using a joint collaborative analysis process, interviews were analyzed separately for Urdu and English language results. After round one revision, we conducted round two. As we were hearing similar beliefs and ideas as in round one and no new major problems emerged in round two, we did not believe {{it was necessary to}} do another round of interviews [24]. In the following discussion, the interpretive analysis of data will: (1) discuss findings related to the 12 scripted verbal probes; (2) report on common or unique themes reflecting beliefs or ideas that emerged from respondents; and (3) present key issues that were identified and compared across both the Urdu and English language surveys.|$|R

40|$|Most {{public schools}} in the United States were {{designed}} and built {{in the second half of}} the last century. Their buildings typically consist of classrooms and narrow, locker-lined hallways. The former clearly belong to the teachers and best support lecturestyle instruction. The latter are the locations for social interaction between students during their breaks. Many educators, administrators, and researchers worry about teenage behavior in high schools. Student peer culture is commonly understood as problematic. In response, break times typically are minimized, supervision routines are designed to be seamless, and educational policies regulate disciplinary institutional responses to acts of violence between students. This research study investigates teenagers' break behavior in a contemporary school building that is unlike the institutional school buildings most current educators are used to and experience as "normal". The ethnographic case examines the relationships between high school student break behavior, local disciplinary practices, and a school building designed to blur the boundaries between lounge-like social spaces and informal educational spaces. Over the course of six months, the researcher spent 42 school days with Orbit High's teenagers in the spaces in between. Primary sources of data were field <b>notes,</b> <b>log</b> entries, behavioral maps, and open-ended interviews with 24 purposefully chosen participants...|$|R
