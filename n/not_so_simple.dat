The category CABA of all CABAs and their complete homomorphisms is dual to the category of sets and their functions, meaning that it {{is equivalent to the}} opposite of that category (the category resulting from reversing all morphisms). Things are <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>simple</b> for the category Bool of Boolean algebras and their homomorphisms, which Marshall Stone showed in effect (though he lacked both the language and the conceptual framework to make the duality explicit) to be dual to the category of totally disconnected compact Hausdorff spaces, subsequently called Stone spaces.|$|E

25|$|Cognitive neuropsychology is a {{relatively}} new development and has emerged as a distillation of the complementary approaches of both experimental and clinical neuropsychology. It seeks to understand the mind and brain by studying people who have suffered brain injury or neurological illness. One model of neuropsychological functioning is known as functional localization. This is based on the principle that if a specific cognitive problem can be found after an injury to a specific area of the brain, it is possible that this part of the brain is in some way involved. However, there may be {{reason to believe that the}} link between mental functions and neural regions is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>simple.</b> An alternative model of the link between mind and brain, such as parallel processing, may have more explanatory power for the workings and dysfunction of the human brain. Yet another approach investigates how the pattern of errors produced by brain-damaged individuals can constrain our understanding of mental representations and processes without reference to the underlying neural structure. A more recent but related approach is cognitive neuropsychiatry which seeks to understand the normal function of mind and brain by studying psychiatric or mental illness.|$|E
25|$|Folk {{dancing is}} a strong {{influence}} {{in many of the}} books. From Girls of the Hamlet Club (1914) and At School with the Roundheads (1915) until The Girls of the Abbey School (1921), it was shown as a fairly easy thing for girls to do, and to teach each other. By the time of The Abbey Girls Go Back to School (1922) it is apparent that Oxenham herself had come into contact with the English Folk Dance Society and realised that the dances were <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>simple</b> after all. The books written from this time for the next six years or so, until Abbey Girls Win Through (1928) depict members of the EFDS hierarchy with affection and almost reverence. It seems that something happened to spoil this relationship, as after 1930 these characters do not appear in the books, and are hardly referred to again, certainly not in such glowing terms. The EFDS makes a brief appearance in An Abbey Champion (1946), but the personnel are no longer named. It may have been as simple as the move to Worthing and the impossibility of maintaining as close a friendship at a distance of some sixty miles, but it has been conjectured that 'Madam' (Helen Kennedy North) and 'The Pixie' (Daisy Caroline Daking) may have objected to the way they were being portrayed. Oxenham never lost the love of folk dancing itself, however, and always shows it as a healthy form of exercise, and a way of lifting oneself out of depression.|$|E

The Alliance's main problem is that it seeks to govern everyone, {{regardless}} of whether they desire to belong to the central government or not.

2500|$|The coldest {{location}} in the Northern Hemisphere {{is not in the}} Arctic, but rather in the interior of Russia's Far East, in the upper-right quadrant of the maps. [...] This is due to the region's continental climate, far from the moderating influence of the ocean, and to the valleys in the region that can trap cold, dense air and create strong temperature inversions, where the temperature increases, rather than decreases, with height (Serreze and Barry, 2005). [...] The lowest officially recorded temperature in the Northern Hemisphere is the subject of controversy, due to the type of instrumentation used. These temperatures were measured by spirit thermometer, which is less accurate than a mercury thermometer. [...] Measurement by spirit (alcohol) thermometers must be corrected (usually the correction is positive, being about 0.2°C, but it is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>simple).</b> According to [...] "Climate of the USSR, issue 24, part I, Leningrad, 1956," [...] the coldest temperature of −67.7°C (−90°F) occurred in Oymyakon on 6 February 1933, as well as in Verkhoyansk on 5 and 7 February 1892, respectively. [...] However, this region {{is not part of the}} Arctic because its continental climate also allows it to have warm summers, with an average July temperature of 15°C (59°F). [...] In the figure below showing station climatologies, the plot for Yakutsk is representative of this part of the Far East; Yakutsk has a slightly less extreme climate than Verkhoyansk.|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} of evolutionary advancement {{has quite a}} history. Of course, pre-Darwin, it was believed without question that Man stood {{at the head of}} a pyramid (scala naturae). The matter is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>simple</b> with evolution by natural selection; Darwin's own opinion varied from time to time. In the Origin he wrote [...] "And as natural selection works by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection". This was much too strong; as Sober remarks, there is nothing in the theory of natural selection which demands that selection must produce an increase in complexity or any other measure of advancement. It is merely compatible with the theory that this might happen. Elsewhere Darwin admits that [...] "naturalists have not yet defined to each other's satisfaction what is meant by high and low forms" [...] (p.336); nor have they now – this is one of the problems. Other evolutionary biologists have had similar thoughts to Huxley: G. Ledyard Stebbins and Bernhard Rensch, for example. The term for progressive evolution is anagenesis, though this does not necessarily include the idea of improvement.The objective description of complexity was one of the issues addressed by cybernetics in the 1950s. The idea that advanced machines (including living beings) could exert more control over their environments and operate in a wider range of situations perhaps serves as a basis for making the terms such as 'advanced' amenable to more exact definition. This is a debate that continues today.|$|E
2500|$|With pseudo-penannular brooches, {{things are}} <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>simple</b> {{and the manner}} in which they were used is still debated; the method was {{probably}} not the same for all brooches. One method may have been to pull folds of the cloth through the ring until they could be pierced by the pin, and then pull the cloth back until the pin rested on the ring. This would work best with brooches with a pin not much longer than the diameter of the ring, which some have, but others do not. The second method might have been simply to pin the cloth vertically, leaving the ring hanging unattached to the cloth; this does not seem very secure. [...] The third method relied on a length of chain or cord attached to the ring near the [...] "terminals" [...] (which in pseudo-penannular brooches do not actually terminate), which was used to secure the pin by tying it down, perhaps with a small pin at the end, which was also put through the cloth. [...] The Tara Brooch was probably fastened in this way. In some cases the pin was fitted with a bolt or rivet to make it removable. [...] A further complication is that in some pseudo-penannular brooches the pin is fixed to lie in front of the ring, as in the Londesborough Brooch (below), but in others it crosses through the ring, starting with the head end in front of the ring, but the middle of the pin behind the ring by the point where it crosses at the other side; the Tara Brooch has been displayed set up in both ways. [...] The latter arrangement seems more common in later brooches, of the 9th century.|$|E
