50|$|A <b>newspaper</b> <b>stamp</b> is {{a special}} type of postage stamp used to pay the cost of mailing {{newspapers}} and other periodicals. Although many types were issued in the 19th century, typically representing rates reduced from regular mail, they generally fell out of use in the mid-20th century, as mail services began to arrange bulk handling directly with publishers.|$|E
50|$|The paper {{claimed that}} the <b>newspaper</b> <b>stamp</b> was a tax on knowledge; it had the {{significant}} motto 'Knowledge is power'. Hetherington's paper was enormously successful and achieved sales of 15,000 copies a week {{all over the country}} despite being London-based.

5000|$|The Scotsman was {{launched}} in 1817 as a liberal weekly newspaper by lawyer William Ritchie and customs official Charles Maclaren {{in response to the}} [...] "unblushing subservience" [...] of competing newspapers to the Edinburgh establishment. The paper was pledged to [...] "impartiality, firmness and independence". After the abolition of <b>newspaper</b> <b>stamp</b> tax in Scotland in 1850, The Scotsman was relaunched as a daily newspaper priced at 1d and a circulation of 6,000 copies.|$|E
50|$|Advertisement {{duty was}} {{abolished}} in 1853, followed by <b>newspaper</b> <b>stamp</b> duty in 1855. The paper duty was removed in 1861. William Gladstone, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, repealed the paper duties, {{but only after}} a false start in 1860, when the House of Lords rejected his bill, against conventions on financial issues. The following year Gladstone returned to the measure, consolidated into a Budget Finance Bill, the first such: the Lords chose not to reject the Budget as a whole.|$|E
50|$|The exact use of <b>newspaper</b> <b>stamps</b> varied; small-value stamps were {{generally}} {{intended to be}} affixed to newspaper wrappers, in much the fashion of regular mail, but with values usually less than regular stamps.

5000|$|The Scotsman was {{launched}} in 1817 as a liberal weekly newspaper by lawyer William Ritchie and customs official Charles Maclaren {{in response to the}} [...] "unblushing subservience" [...] of competing newspapers to the Edinburgh establishment. The paper was pledged to [...] "impartiality, firmness and independence". Its modern editorial line is firmly anti-independence. After the abolition of <b>newspaper</b> <b>stamp</b> tax in Scotland in 1855, The Scotsman was relaunched as a daily newspaper priced at 1d and a circulation of 6,000 copies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{campaign}} against [...] "taxes on knowledge" [...] made further {{progress in the}} 1850s, after more fundamental Chartist political agitation dropped back. The People's Charter Union of 1848 was set up primarily to oppose O'Connor. It had as treasurer Richard Moore, who conducted a steady activist role in {{the abolition of the}} <b>newspaper</b> <b>stamp</b> duty. Via the intermediate National Stamp Abolition Committee, by making the central organisational vehicle the new Association for Promoting the Repeal of Taxes on Knowledge (APRTOK, also called Society for the Repeal of the Taxes on Knowledge) he was able to involve Richard Cobden. Cobden had already publicised in 1848 his wish to remove some of the taxes.|$|E
50|$|Bulwer-Lytton {{began his}} career as a {{follower}} of Jeremy Bentham. In 1831 he was elected member for St Ives in Cornwall, after which he was returned for Lincoln in 1832, and sat in Parliament for that city for nine years. He spoke in favour of the Reform Bill, and took the leading part in securing the reduction, after vainly essaying the repeal, of the <b>newspaper</b> <b>stamp</b> duties. His influence was perhaps most keenly felt when, on the Whigs’ dismissal from office in 1834, he issued a pamphlet entitled A Letter to a Late Cabinet Minister on the Crisis. Lord Melbourne, then Prime Minister, offered him a lordship of the admiralty, which he declined as likely to interfere with his activity as an author.|$|E

50|$|After {{the failed}} {{revolution}} of 1848, the Hungarian post was reabsorbed into Austrian administration. Franz Joseph I issued a Postal Patent on 26 December 1850, which restored pre-1848 conditions. There were several {{developments in the}} next few years, including the unification of normal and mail-coach delivery, and the introduction of stamps and of money orders in 1850. From 1855 letters were delivered to home addresses, trains started to carry letters, and express delivery was introduced in 1859. Postage stamps were issued for the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary on 1 June 1867 in eight values along with one 1 Kreuzer (krajcár in Hungarian) <b>newspaper</b> <b>stamp.</b> Stamps of Austria were withdrawn from the Kingdom of Hungary on 31 May 1867. The dual monarchy stamps were in use there for just over one year.|$|E
50|$|The Bristolian {{began as}} a {{newspaper}} in 1827 {{under the control of}} the radical journalist James Acland. Undercutting the advertising rates of existing weekly papers, conducting a lively letter column and breaking the law by publishing at one and a half pence without paying the <b>newspaper</b> <b>stamp</b> tax, Acland’s publication was a muck-raking popular radical paper for the working classes. The paper concentrated on exposing the abuses both of the unreformed Corporation which ran Bristol and of the Courts, and was spiced up with demands for an overhaul of the national political system. Acland was imprisoned in 1829 but not before he had fanned the flames of popular revolt. In 1830 Acland, stood, unsuccessfully, for Parliament. The following year, in 1831, the city exploded with the Bristol Riots in which the wealthy elite attacked by Acland in his newspaper were physically affronted with the discontent it had seeded.|$|E
5000|$|Alfred Novello {{promoted}} {{and built}} the business into a huge commercial success, and is credited as being the first to introduce inexpensive sheet music (reducing the retail price {{by a factor of}} four) and to depart from the method of publishing by subscription. In 1836 Novello started the publication of The Musical World, a weekly periodical that was the first devoted to music; its publication continued until 1891. From 1841 Henry Littleton assisted him, becoming a partner in 1861, when the firm became Novello & Co., and, on Alfred Novello's retirement and the completion of the sale in 1866, sole proprietor. Having incorporated the firm of Ewer & Co. in 1867, the title was changed to Novello, Ewer & Co., and still later back to Novello & Co., and, on Henry Littleton's death in 1888, his two sons carried on the business. Before his retirement, Alfred Novello actively worked against British [...] "taxation of knowledge" [...] and {{played a significant role in}} the 1853 repeal of the advertisement duty, the 1855 repeal of the <b>newspaper</b> <b>stamp,</b> repeal of duties on paper and foreign books, and repeal of the security system. He was a friend of Henry Bessemer.|$|E
50|$|The first {{specifically}} Hungarian stamp {{was released}} on 1 May 1871. The stamp was produced by the State Press of Buda by lithography, followed by an engraved set and <b>newspaper</b> <b>stamps.</b> There was no indication of language, but the face of Franz Josef appeared above the national emblem, for values 2 to 25 kreuzer. The 25 kreuzer image helps to distinguish the issues.|$|R
50|$|Austria's <b>newspaper</b> <b>stamps</b> first {{appeared}} in 1851. They depicted a profile of Mercury, the Roman messenger god, and were not denominated, {{the color of the}} stamp indicating the value. Blue indicated the 6/10 kreuzer rate for one newspaper, yellow for ten newspapers (6 kr), and rose for 50 newspapers (30 kr). The higher denominations franked wrappers of bundles of newspapers and were frequently discarded.|$|R
