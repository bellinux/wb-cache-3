With all the main parties committed to the Union new nationalist and independent political groupings began to emerge, including the <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> of Scotland in 1928 and Scottish Party in 1930. They joined together to form the Scottish <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> (SNP) in 1934 with the goal of creating an independent Scotland, but it enjoyed little electoral success in the Westminster system.|$|E
