40|$|This article investigates how {{a change}} in minimum <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> {{regulation}} for California skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) affects nurse employment and how induced changes in <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> affect patient mortality. In 2000, legislation increased the minimum <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> standard and altered the calculation of <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing,</b> which created incentives to shift employment to lower skilled nurse labor. SNFs constrained by the new regulation increase absolute and relative hours worked by the lowest skilled type of nurse. Using this regulation change to instrument for measured <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> levels, it is determined that increases in <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> reduce on-site SNF patient mortality.

5|$|Five Days at Memorial: Life and Death in a Storm-Ravaged Hospital is a 2013 non-fiction book by the American {{journalist}} Sheri Fink. The book {{details the}} aftermath of Hurricane Katrina at Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans in August 2005, and is an expansion of a Pulitzer Prize-winning article written by Fink and published in The New York Times Magazine in 2009. It describes the events that took place at Memorial Medical Center over five days as {{thousands of people were}} trapped in the hospital without power. The triage system put into effect deprioritized critically ill patients for evacuation, and a number of these patients were euthanized by medical and <b>nursing</b> <b>staff</b> shortly before the entire hospital was evacuated on the fifth day of the crisis. Fink examines the legal and political consequences of the decision to euthanize patients and the ethical issues surrounding euthanasia and health care in disaster scenarios. The book was well received by most critics and won three awards, including a National Book Critics Circle Award for non-fiction.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{capacity}} for a hospital inpatient unit to provide high quality nursing care {{depends on a}} complex range of factors. Accurately identifying and measuring these factors {{is one of the}} challenges of nursing care quality research. Nursing hours per patient day and skill mix are two quantifiable indicators of capacity to provide nursing care. Aims: The aims of the study are to measure fortnightly, unit-level <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> and compare them to target <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> levels. Method: <b>Nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> and inpatient unit movement data were sourced for the administrative records of three Western Australian tertiary metropolitan hospitals (2004 – 2008). The impact of data source on <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> estimates was tested with linear mixed models, adjusting for financial year. Counts, proportions, means, and standard deviations were used to describe <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> data. Bar graphs depict proportion of nursing hours provided by nurses of different skill levels. Results: Data source did not significantly affect estimate of nursing hours per patient day (p = 0. 788). Fortnights during which <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> targets were not reached were recorded for all units. Skill mix varied between units with different staffing targets. Conclusion: It is feasible to calculate fortnightly nursing hours and skill mix per hospital unit from raw nursing payroll and inpatient unit movement records. Fortnightly, unit-level measurement highlights <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> fluctuations that are masked by annually aggregated data and are relevant for studies which investigate the association between <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> levels and inpatient complication rates. Staffing shortfalls may affect nurses’ experiences of working or patients’ care experiences...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Studies {{have shown}} that <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> levels, among many other factors in the {{hospital}} setting, contribute to adverse patient outcomes. Concerns about patient safety and quality of care have resulted in numerous studies being conducted {{to examine the relationship}} between <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> levels and the incidence of adverse patient events in both general wards and intensive care units. AIM: The aim of this paper is to review literature published in the previous 10 years which examines the relationship between <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> levels and the incidence of mortality and morbidity in adult intensive care unit patients. METHODS: A literature search from 2002 to 2011 using the MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, and Australian digital thesis databases was undertaken. The keywords used were: intensive care; critical care; staffing; nurse staffing; understaffing; nurse-patient ratios; adverse outcomes; mortality; ventilator-associated pneumonia; ventilator-acquired pneumonia; infection; length of stay; pressure ulcer/injury; unplanned extubation; medication error; readmission; myocardial infarction; and renal failure. A total of 19 articles were included in the review. Outcomes of interest are patient mortality and morbidity, particularly infection and pressure ulcers. RESULTS: Most of the studies were observational in nature with variables obtained retrospectively from large hospital databases. <b>Nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> measures and patient outcomes varied widely across the studies. While an overall statistical association between increased <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> levels and decreased adverse patient outcomes was not found in this review, most studies concluded that a trend exists between increased <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> levels and decreased adverse events. CONCLUSION: While an overall statistical association between increased <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> levels and decreased adverse patient outcomes was not found in this review, most studies demonstrated a trend between increased <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> levels and decreased adverse patient outcomes in the intensive care unit which is consistent with previous literature. While further more robust research methodologies need to be tested in order to more confidently demonstrate this association and decrease the influence of the many other confounders to patient outcomes; this would be difficult to achieve in this field of research...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To compare {{characteristics}} of hospitalizations {{with and without}} complications and {{examine the impact of}} <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> on inpatient complications across different unit types. Background: Studies investigating the relationship between <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> and inpatient complications have not shown consistent results. Methodological limitations have been cited as the basis for this lack of uniformity. Our study was designed to address some of these limitations. Design: Retrospective longitudinal hospitalization-level study. Method: Adult hospitalizations to high intensity, general medical and general surgical units at three metropolitan tertiary hospitals were included. Data were sourced from Western Australian Department of Health administrative data collections from 2004 – 2008. We estimated the impact of <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> on inpatient complications adjusted for patient and hospital characteristics and accounted for patients with multiple hospitalizations. Results: The study included 256, 984 hospitalizations across 58 inpatient units. Hospitalizations with complications had significantly different demographic characteristics compared with those without. The direction of the association between <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> and inpatient complications was not consistent for different inpatient complications, nurse skill mix groups or for hospitalizations with different unit movement patterns. Conclusion: Our study design addressed limitations noted in the field, but our results did not support the widely held assumption that improved <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> levels are associated with decreased patient complication rates. Despite a strong international focus on improving <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> to reduce inpatient complications, our results suggest that adding more nurses is not a panacea for reducing inpatient complications to zero...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Getting {{staffing}} levels {{wrong in}} hospitals {{is linked to}} excess mortality and poor patient experiences but establishing the safe <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> levels in the emergency department (ED) is challenging because patient demand is so variable. This paper reports a review conducted for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) which sought to identify the research evidence to inform UK nursing workforce planning. DESIGN: We searched 10 electronic databases and relevant websites for English language studies published from 1994. Studies included reported a direct measure of <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> relative to an activity measure (eg, attendances, patient throughput) or an estimate of <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> requirements. Randomised or non-randomised trials, prospective or retrospective observational, cross-sectional or correlational studies, interrupted time-series, and controlled before and after studies were considered. RESULTS: We identified 16, 132 items via databases and 2193 items through manual and other searching. After title/abstract screening (by one reviewer, checked by a second) 55 studies underwent full assessment by the review team. 18 studies met the inclusion criteria for the NICE review, however 3 simulation studies that reported simulated rather than measured outcomes are not reported here. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence is weak but indicates that levels of <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> in the ED are associated with patients leaving without being seen, ED care time and patient satisfaction. Lower staffing is associated with worse outcomes. There remain significant gaps and in particular a lack of evidence {{on the impact of}} staffing on direct patient outcomes and adequate economic analyses to inform decisions about <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing.</b> Given that an association between <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> levels and patient outcomes on inpatient wards has been demonstrated, this gap in the evidence about <b>nurse</b> <b>staffing</b> in EDs needs to be addressed...|$|R
