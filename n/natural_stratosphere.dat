40|$|In {{order to}} quantitatively {{illustrate}} {{the effects of}} quasi-horizontal transport of certain gases and of the reactions influencing their concentrations, a vertical-meridional pole-to-pole stratospheric model is presented which explicitly predicts concentrations of odd nitrogen and odd hydrogen compounds in the <b>natural</b> <b>stratosphere</b> and also in a perturbed stratosphere incorporating artificial injection of nitrogen oxides by an SST fleet. The northern hemisphere SST operations clearly have a very large local effect on the nitrogen oxide distribution and also {{have a significant effect}} on the southern hemisphere. The largest changes are seen at the point of injection of the nitrogen oxides. Results are in agreement with previous one-dimensional models...|$|E
40|$|Geoengineering by {{injection}} of sulfur {{into the stratosphere}} {{is among the most}} promising methods of solar radiation management techniques under consideration [Royal Society, 2009]. However, recent studies [Heckendorn et al., 2009; Pierce et al., 2010] indicate that injections of sulfur sufficient to counteract a doubling of CO 2 would have significant adverse consequences, including tropopause heating, stratospheric water vapor increases, and ozone depletion. Alumina (Al 2 O 3) particles are more efficient scatterers than sulfate particles and here are investigated for application to geoengineering. However, unlike sulfate, alumina emission has no analog in the <b>natural</b> <b>stratosphere</b> and thus may present unique and unknown risks. We provide an initial evaluation of Al 2 O 3 particle evolution in a jet plume, and a sensitivity study of the impact of Al 2 O 3 particles on stratospheric ozone. Even assuming that the surface area density of Al 2 O 3 is smaller by factors of 5 - 10 than that generated by sulfate geoengineering, we find that ozon...|$|E
40|$|The odd {{hydrogen}} species, especially OH and HO 2 {{are important}} in the chemistry of the <b>natural</b> <b>stratosphere</b> because of their direct reactions with O and O 3 and their role in nitrogen oxide (NO x) cycles. When chlorine {{is added to the}} stratosphere the interaction of NO x, HO x and ClX species yields several potential feedback effects for O 3 perturbations, some stabilizing and some destabilizing. Here we focus on the effects of HO x on O 3 changes due to ClX injections. As ClX selectively attacks the ozone layer above 28 km the layer below tends to be thickened by the increased incidence of solarUV. If HO x densities are high they dampen this radiative feedback and prevent the healing at low altitudes. We demonstrate how the ozone‐layer shape changes under the influence of injected ClX for several choices of key HO x reaction rates. These same reaction rates exert partial control over the apportioning of Cl atoms among HCl, ClO and Cl, over the total amount of HO x, the ratios of OH to HO 2 and H 2 O 2 and the ratio of [NO + NO 2] to [HNO 3]. The uncertainty in these rates leads to at least a factor of three uncertainty in predicted ozone reductions due to ClX injections. © 1976 by the Chinese Geophysical Societ...|$|E
40|$|The role of bromine {{compounds}} in the photochemistry of the <b>natural</b> and perturbed <b>stratosphere</b> has been reexamined using an expanded reaction scheme {{and the results}} of recent laboratory studies of several key reactions. The most important finding is that through the reaction BrO + CIO → Br + Cl + O 2, there is a synergistic effect between bromine and chlorine which results in an efficient catalytic destruction of ozone in the lower stratosphere. One-dimensional photochemical model results indicate that BrO is the major bromine species throughout the stratosphere, followed by BrONO 2, HBr, HOBr and Br. We show from the foregoing that bromine is more efficient than chlorine as a catalyst for destroying ozone, and discuss the implications for stratospheric ozone of possible future growth in the industrial and agricultural use of bromine. Bromine concentrations of 20 pptv (2 × 10 ^− 11), as suggested by recent observations, can decrease the present-day integrated ozone column density by 2. 4 %, and can enhance ozone depletion from steady-state chlorofluoromethane release at 1973 rates by a factor of 1. 1 – 1. 2...|$|R
