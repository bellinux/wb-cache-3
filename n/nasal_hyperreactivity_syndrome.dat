40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> or hyperresponsiveness in {{allergic}} and nonallergic rhinitis. Hyperreactivity represents an altered state of the upper or lower airways, resulting in an exaggerated response to non-specific stimuli encountered in the environment. Generally, hyperrea. ctivity is a major feature of the disease leading to recurrent or chronic symptoms. In allergic rhinitis and asthma hyperreactivity will reinforce the response after allergen exposure. Although {{it is known that}} patients with allergic and non-allergic rhinitis often react with symptoms to environmental non-specific stimuli, standardized and generally accepted tools for measurement of <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> are not available. Many investigators demonstrated a relation between hyperreactivity of the lower airways and IgE-mediated allergy, especially with respect to the link between hyperreactivity and late phase allergic reactions. However, in nasal allergy a relative backlog exists regarding insight into interactions between IgE-mediated reactions and nasal hyperreactivityThis thesis focuses on answering two questions: L How to measure <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> ? 2. What is the role and clinical significance of <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity,</b> especially in <b>nasal</b> allergy ? After {{a review of the literature}} (part I, Chapter 2) the current methods of assessment of <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> are analysed (part II). To this end, nasal challenges with various non-specific stimuli were performed in allergic and non-allergic rhinitis patients compared to healthy subjects (chapters 3, 4 and 5). Subsequently the clinical aspects of <b>hyperreactivity</b> in <b>nasal</b> allergy (part III) have been investigated. The relevance of hyperresponsiveness was analysed with respect to the daily symptoms of the patient and the activity of the nasal disease at the time of the test (Chapter 6). In addition the influence of natural allergen exposure on nasal challenge tests was studied (Chapter 7). Closely connected with this study is the investigation of late phase allergic reactions in relation to <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> (Chapter 8). Finally a combined nasal hyperresponsiveness and allergy to avian antigens in a birdkeeper is reported in Chapter 9. In Chapter 10 the experiments described in this thesis are summarised.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> is the {{symptomatic}} {{expression of}} vasomotor rhinitis. This study describes a typical nasal reaction, {{represented by a}} "volley of sneezes" found in some patients during nasal endoscopy, and to assess the possible correlation between hyperreactivity and a particular clinical and cytological condition. METHODS: We studied 671 rhinological subjects, 344 male, mean age 35. 7 ± 13. 76 standard deviation (SD) years. All were submitted to medical histories and clinical and instrumental investigations (skin prick test, nasal endoscopy, and nasal cytology). While performing endoscopy, particular {{attention was paid to}} the possible signs of <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity,</b> in particular "volley of sneezes" both during and immediately after the diagnostic procedure.

40|$|The {{inflammatory}} process {{triggered by}} the <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity,</b> whether specific or aspecific, presents three components: immunomediation - neurogenic - interconnection between the nervous and the immunitary systems. Neuropeptides (eg SP and CGRP) are among the agents responsible for neurogenic phlogosis and, in our opinion, they contribute towards the onset of polyps. Capsaicin, which acts on the C fibres, has been applied locally (30 μm) by the AA in 15 patients affected by aspecific <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> with polyps, {{in the course of}} a double blind study with an equal number of patients. Treatment was given once a week for 5 consecutive weeks in order to evaluate the effect on both the hyperreactivity and the polyps. Before and after each session and at the 1 - and 3 -month controls the following tests were carried out: assessment of symptoms, nasal endoscopy, sizing of the polyps, aspecific nasal provocation test and nasal cytology.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Is forced {{expiration}} {{through the}} nose a mechanical stimulus to which patients with <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> react? Do parameters, such as peak nasal expiratory flow rate (PNEF), influence nasal airway resistance (NAR) in these patients? METHOD: NAR, mucus production and sneezing were measured on 2 occasions two weeks apart. Measurements were conducted before and {{during a period of}} 10 minutes after 3 repeated PNEFs in 15 non-allergic non-infectious perennial rhinitis (NANIPER) patients suffering from <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity,</b> and in 15 controls. RESULTS: In NANIPER versus controls PNEF measurements attributed to a statistically significant increase in NAR. The main effect was within the first minute after stimulus, suggesting a neuronal mechanism. Mucus secretions and sneezing were hardly present. PNEF (highest of 3) and bronchial peak expiratory flow rate (BpEFR) are lower in NANIPER than controls but are correlated. Impaired bronchial capacity is likely to influence PNEF, resulting in a lower decrease of nasal patency. CONCLUSION: PNEF depends on BpEFR and is an adequate mechanical stimulus for NANIPER patients, but not for non-rhinitic controls, resulting in a brief increase in NA...|$|R
40|$|Allergic {{rhinitis}} (AR) and hyperractive disorders of {{the upper}} airways, depending upon the type of releasing stimuli, are defined as <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity,</b> for example {{in the case of}} AR, or as non-specific <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> and as idiopathic rhinitis (IR) (synonyms frequently used in the past: non-specific nasal hyperreactivity; vasomotor rhinitis) in the case of non-characterised stimuli.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the lower}} airways an {{association}} {{has been found}} between early phase reaction (EPR), late phase reaction (LPR), and bronchial hyperreactivity. However, this association has not been shown for the upper airways in nasal pollen challenge studies. A study was undertaken {{to determine whether the}} EPR, LPR, and <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> are related in perennial allergic rhinitis. METHODS: Twenty four patients with rhinitis who were allergic to house dust mite (HDM) were challenged with HDM extract. The nasal response was monitored by symptom scores and nasal lavages for up to 9. 5 hours after challenge and concentrations of albumin, tryptase, and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in the lavage fluid were measured. Thirteen patients (defined as dual responders) had increased symptom scores between 3. 5 and 9. 5 hours compared with the baseline score. The other 11 patients (defined as early responders) showed an isolated EPR only. <b>Nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> was determined by nasal histamine challenge 24 hours later. RESULTS: Dual responders showed a significantly higher symptom score, albumin influx, and tryptase release during the EPR. During the late phase (3. 5 - 9. 5 hours) albumin influx was significantly increased at most time points and ECP release was significantly higher at 9. 5 hours in the dual responder group. Dual responders showed a significantly stronger response to all doses of histamine. The area under the curve (AUC) of symptom scores during EPR and LPR and the AUC of the histamine dose response were significantly correlated (EPR-LPR: r = 0. 49, p < 0. 01; EPR-histamine: r = 0. 75, p < 0. 001; LPR-histamine: r = 0. 66, p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with perennial allergic rhinitis the nasal responses to allergen and histamine are associated. Dual responders have an increased EPR, increased levels of mediators, and increased allergen-induced hyperreactivity. ...|$|R

40|$|Literature is convincing {{regarding}} {{the efficacy of}} capsaicin nasal treatment in idiopathic rhinitis (IR). However, up to 50 % of IR patients {{do not meet the}} strict inclusion criteria of the trials conducted so far. As a consequence, the efficacy of capsaicin is unknown in a significant number of IR patients that do not meet the strict inclusion/exclusion criteria (1) (2). 'Mixed rhinitis' (MR) patients have more than one major etiologic factor involved in the mucosal pathology. We have no idea about the efficacy of capsaicin nasal spray in these patients nor about the time interval to seek a second application.

40|$|Nuclear antigens {{are known}} to trigger off innate and {{adaptive}} immune responses. Recent {{studies have found that}} the complex of nucleic acids and core histones that are derived from damaged cells may regulate allergic responses. However, no fundamental study has been performed concerning the role of linker histone H 1 in mast cell-mediated type I hyperreactivity. In this study, we explored the impact of histone H 1 on mast cell-mediated allergic responses both in vitro and in vivo. In the course of a bona-fide experimental allergen sensitization model upon co-injection with alum adjuvant, ovalbumin (OVA), but not PBS, induced elevated levels of circulating histone H 1. Intranasal challenge with histone H 1 to OVA/alum- (but not PBS/alum) -sensitized mice induced significantly severer symptoms of allergic rhinitis than those in mice sensitized and challenged with OVA. A monoclonal antibody against histone H 1 not only suppressed mast cell degranulation, but also ameliorated OVA-induced <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> and IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis.

40|$|It {{is known}} {{that a variety of}} stimuli such as capsaicin, bradykinin, hyperosmotic saline {{solution}} and cigarette smoke can activate sensitive respiratory neurons and a release of a variety of mediators such as tachykinins substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA). Tachykinins are responsible for <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity,</b> bronchial obstruction and chronic inflammation in the airways. Unlike a lot of information about its pharmacological effects, the mechanism of biosynthesis and release of tachykinins is little known. In the present study, tachykinin induction was investigated in nasal trigeminal neurons under exposure of nerve growth factor (NGF) and in sensory airway-specific vagal neurons in allergic airway inflammation. Due to the help of neuronal tracing technique in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation, it was possible to show the effects of NGF and ovalbumin A (OVA) in the induction of tachykinins in sensory neurons. After NGF application, tachykinins were detected in glutamine-negative, neurofilament-positive and neurofilament-negative neurons. The results suggest that nasal-specific trigeminal neurons are composed of heterogeneous subpopulations. In further experiments was detected a tachykinin induction after OVA-sensitization in myelinated axons of airway-specific sensory neurons. Most likely there is a quite new neuronal subpopulation, which due to a stimulus such as an allergen, responds with synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides. Sensitization leads to an increase of NGF, this enhances the release and induction of tachykinins from sensory neurons with a potentiation of neurogenic airway inflammatio...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt is done {{a review}} of {{evaluation}} methods of the inflammation in upper airways and bronchi used for diagnosis, therapeutic approach and prognosis of pa-thologies like rhinosinusitis and asthma. It is also analysed methods that supply relevant information of inflammation in COPD. The chronic inflammation of the airways is associated to respiratory distress, obstruction in basal lung function tests and to bronchial and <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity.</b> Computerized tomography informs about lu-men dimensions, bronchial walls thickness and pulmonary density. These changes are associated to inflammation and to remodelling of the airways. Localized inflammation in respiratory tract can be detected by modifications of systemic inflammatory markers. The direct evaluation of inflammatory airways changes are based on immune, histological and chemical analysis of lung tissue obtained by biopsies and by fluids recoil in basal conditions or after stimulation. The eosinophils are increased in biopsies and in nasal and bronchoalveolar lavage in asthma and rhinitis and can change with therapy. Proteins and mRNA expression of cellular activation mediators are also observed. The induced sputum identifies eosinophilic inflammation that is inversely associated with lung function parameters. In each respiratory cycle the air is enriched in organic volatile compounds produced by cellular breathing. FENO is the bio marker more deeply studied in asthma and its increase is well documented in this disorder. In the exhaled air condensed, reactive oxygen species, membrane mediators, cytokines, and chemokines are identified. If the non invasive evaluation of inflammation became reliable and reproducible it will be indispensable in monitoring the airways diseases. Rev Port Pneumol 2009; XV (3) : 443 - 46...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{a recent}} study, {{we showed that}} {{intranasal}} capsaicin spray gives a significant and long-term reduction of symptoms in nonallergic noninfectious perennial rhinitis patients. However, in daily practice, the studied application regimen proved to be impractical {{because of the large}} number of visits required {{in a short period of}} time. In the present study, we conducted a double-blind double-dummy parallel groups trial to determine whether a more practical capsaicin application schedule is equally effective. METHODS: Thirty patients were randomized into two different treatment regimens: one group received capsaicin five times on the first day at 1 -h intervals. This was followed by a placebo dummy once every second or third day for a total of five treatments 2 weeks after the capsaicin application (group A). The other group (B) received the placebo dummy five times on the first day followed by capsaicin once every second or third day for a total of five treatments 2 weeks after the placebo application. RESULTS: The visual analogue scale scores for overall nasal symptoms, rhinorrhea and nasal blockage showed significant decrease after the start of treatment in both groups, with a significantly steeper decrease in group A. A significant reduction in cold dry air dose responsiveness was also found up to 9 months after therapy in both groups, reflecting a decrease in <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity.</b> No significant changes in safety data (smell, blood pressure, heart rate) were found.

In this study, an ENT screening {{was carried out in}} 22 patients affected by chronic variable immunodeficiency and treated with chronic immunoglobulin administration. All the patients underwent ENT physical examination, nasal endoscopy by fiberoptics, mucociliary transport test (MTT), anterior rhinorheomanometry (RRM), nasal provocation test with cold water (ANPT), audiometry and impedentiometry, olfactory evaluation, and paranasal sinus X rays. Dysphagia was present in 91 % of the patients, nasal secretion and obstruction in 77 %, and hypoacusia, tinnitus, and otodinia in 57 %. Rhinitis and pharyngitis were observed in 86 % of the patients, and serous middle ear effusion in 50 %. Confirmed maxillary sinusitis was observed in five patients. Hyposmia was observed in 50 % of the patients. MTT was significantly longer in the patients than in the controls (18. 0 ± 10. 5 vs. 11. 2 ± 2. 4 min; p <. 05).

40|$|Idiopathic {{rhinitis}} (IR) is a prevalent {{condition for}} which capsaicin nasal spray {{is the most}} effective treatment. However, the mechanisms underlying IR and the therapeutic action of capsaicin remain unknown. We sought to investigate the molecular and cellular bases of IR and the therapeutic action of capsaicin. Fourteen patients with IR and 12 healthy control subjects (HCs) were treated with intranasal capsaicin. The therapeutic effect was assessed in patients with IR by using visual analog scale and therapeutic response evaluation scores, and <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> was evaluated by means of cold dry air provocation. Nasal samples served to measure the levels of neuromediators and expression of chemosensory cation channels, protein gene product 9. 5 (PGP 9. 5), and the mast cell marker c-kit. The effects of capsaicin were also tested in vitro on human nasal epithelial cells and mast cells. Patients with IR had higher baseline transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V, receptor 1 (TRPV 1) expression in the nasal mucosa and higher concentrations of substance P (SP) in nasal secretions than HCs. Symptomatic relief was observed in 11 of 14 patients with IR after capsaicin treatment. Expression of TRPV 1; transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M, receptor 8 (TRPM 8); and PGP 9. 5 was only reduced in patients with IR after capsaicin treatment. Capsaicin did not alter c-KIT expression or nasal epithelial morphology in patients with IR and HCs nor did it induce apoptosis or necrosis in cultured human nasal epithelial cells and mast cells.

40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Demonstration of <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> (NHR) in {{allergic}} and nonallergic rhinitis {{remains a}} diagnostic challenge {{because of the}} lack of a clinically attractive protocol with high sensitivity and specificity. Our aim was to evaluate the feasibility of a shortened cold dry air (CDA) provocation protocol for the diagnosis of NHR in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and idiopathic rhinitis (IR). STUDY DESIGN: Twelve AR patients, 12 IR patients, and 12 controls were exposed to air at - 10 °C and < 10 % humidity for 15 minutes. METHODS: Nasal symptoms were subjectively evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS), and nasal obstruction was objectively measured by peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) before and after CDA exposure. NHR was defined as a drop in PNIF larger than 20 % from baseline upon CDA challenge. RESULTS: Nasal CDA exposure induced nasal obstruction in AR and IR patients but not in controls. The VAS for nasal obstruction increased significantly in IR patients (post-CDA: 9. 1 cm [6. 9, 9. 7] vs. pre-CDA: 5. 5 cm [5. 0, 8. 9], P =. 004) as well as in AR patients (post-CDA: 5. 0 cm [1. 3, 6. 6] vs. pre-CDA: 0. 8 cm [0. 0, 1. 7], P =. 001). PNIF values showed a significant decrease in the AR (post-CDA: 50. 0 L/min [37. 5, 97. 5] vs. pre-CDA: 95. 0 L/min [52. 5, 127. 5], P =. 002) and IR (post-CDA: 75. 0 L/min [47. 5, 102. 5] vs. pre-CDA: 100. 0 L/min [67. 5, 130. 0], P =. 002) group after CDA provocation, which was not observed in the controls (P = 1. 000). The sensitivity and specificity of CDA provocation for diagnosis of NHR were 66. 7 % and 100 %, respectively, for both IR and AR. In contrast to nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea and sneezing were not induced by CDA exposure. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that a short nasal CDA exposure is a reliable method for the diagnosis of NHR in rhinitis patients, with a high sensitivity and specificity.

40|$|Clinical {{manifestation of}} chronic {{rhinitis}} {{is due to}} local release of mediators from inflammatory cells. Eosinophil leukocytes are important in pathogenesis of nasal hypersensitivity as well as <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> [1, 2]. The aim {{of the study was}} to follow-up the effect of local corticosteroid treatment on a number of eosinophils in nasal secretion of patients with chronic rhinitis. The study was prospective and controlled. A total number of 88 subjects was included in the study. Patients with chronic rhinitis who were treated with local corticosteroids (63) constituted the experimental group (37 with isolated allergic rhinitis, 10 with isolated nonallergic noninfective hyperreactive rhinitis, 10 with allergic rhinitis associated with nasal polyposis and 6 with nonallergic noninfective hyperreactive rhinitis associated with nasal polyposis). There were 25 patients with chronic rhinitis in the control group (18 with iso- lated allergic rhinitis, 2 with isolated nonallergic noninfective hyperreactive rhinitis, 3 with allergic rhinitis associated with nasal polyposis, and 2 with nonallergic noninfective, hyperreactive rhinitis associated with nasal polyposis). During the treatment with beclomethasone dipropionate aqueous nasal spray (daily dose was 400 micrograms during 6 weeks for isolated rhinitis and 6 months for associated forms of rhinitis), control examinations were regularly performed. The first control was after one week the second after six weeks, the third after three months and the fourth after six months. The same control was carried out in the control group of patients who were without therapy. Cytological examination of nasal secretions included brush method of collecting secretions, staining smears with Leishman's stain and light microscopic scrutinising of nasal smear magnified up to 1000 times. The results of the study demonstrated the highly significant decrease in the number of eosinophils after the therapy in patients with isolated allergic rhinitis (x 2 (FR) = 71. 121, DF = 2, ρ 0. 05) nor in subgroup with hyperreactive rhinitis associated with nasal polyposis (x 2 (FR) = 0. 250, DF = 2, ρ > 0. 05) (Table 2). Local corticosteroids have the potential to influence the regulation of eosinophil apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis by beclomethasone dipropionate treatment is an efficient way to remove eosinophil leukocytes from inflammatory sites [8]. The locally used corticosteroids in chronic rhinitis reduced significantly the number of eosinophils in nasal secretion.

40|$|An {{association}} between asthma and gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) is well recognized but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. The authors suggest that could exist an {{association between}} GER and upper airways hyperreactivity and this association could represents the mechanism underlying the lower esophageal sphincter releasing, that determine the reflux. In fact they suppose that, the noxious injury of acid reflux follows a course that could be: pharynx → larynx → bronchi → 1 / 3 inferior of the esophagus → reflux. From these presuppositions the authors carried out {{a study on the}} possible relationship between GER and non-specific hyperreactivity of upper airways on 14 subjects, divided in 2 groups: 10 subjects with functional GER, 4 subjects suffering from GER caused by hiatus hernia as control group. All patients had a thorough medical history, ENT examination with rigid and flexible endoscope, anterior Rhinomanometry (RRM), skin-test for inhalant and alimentary allergens, RAST, audiometric exam, non-specific nasal provocation test (NSNPT) with histamine, using as control the number of sneezes. From a through analysis of objective examination and from the results of the NSNPT with histamine resulted that all subjects with functional GER were rhinopathics. In all tests both in vivo (Skin-test) and in vitro (RAST) for the most common allergens (pollens-inhalant-mycophites-alimentary) the results were negative. The authors also found an involvement of paranasal sinuses that raised: 91 % in the patients with recurrents phlogosis due to non specific nasal hyperreactivity; 40. 9 % in the allergic subjects (20 % in the Graminacee +; 32 % in the Parietaria O. +; 76 % in the Dermatophagoides Pt. +; others 4 %); 100 % in the ASA-intollerance subjects. The NSNSPT with histamine showed in the group with functional GER a hyperreactivity with sneezes in 6 / 10 subjects, and 1 / 4 subjects of the group with GER with hiatus hernia. The RRM variations showed an unilateral <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> in 6 / 10, bilateral in 3 / 10 subjects of the group with functional GER. In the group with GER with hiatus hernia only 1 / 4 subject showed reliable unilateral RRM variation.

40|$|In {{allergic}} or asthmatic airways disease, {{upper and}} lower airways show a uniform eosinophilic inflammation of the mucosa, and bronchial hyperreactivity is a common finding. To study the co- variation of mucosal reactivity in {{upper and lower}} airways, histamine challenges of both sites were performed {{in a group of}} patients with allergic rhinitis during non-season. Upper airways were monitored during challenge by the use of rhinostereometry, an optical technique that non-invasively measures nasal mucosa swelling. An increased histamine response was found in both nose and bronchi, and a subgroup of patients with non-specific nasal complaints reacted more strongly to histamine than patients without such problems, indicating that some patients with allergic rhinitis develop a permanent <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity.</b> By contrast, in patients with nasal polyposis, the nasal mucosa was non-reactive to histamine and thus did not differ from healthy volunteers in that respect, even though asthma and bronchial hyperreactivity was a common finding. Hence, although upper and lower airways mostly seem to react uniformly in allergic or asthmatic airway disease, non-specific reactivity may differ between the two sites. However, airway hyperreactivity was not restricted to the eosinophilic type of inflammation. Also in healthy volunteers exposed to swine dust by weighing pigs for 3 hours in a swine confinement building, a procedure known to induce an intense neutrophilic airway inflammation (organic dust toxic syndrome), both nasal and bronchial histamine reactivity were found to increase. In swine dust induced inflammation, neutrophils were found to rapidly migrate into the upper airways as detected by nasal lavage. Hence, there was {{reason to believe that the}} endothelial cells might be activated in this condition, and that endothelial cells, known controllers of leukocyte subset migration, also might influence the induction of airway hyperreactivity. Additional studies on swine dust exposed subjects revealed signs of activation of neutrophil/endothelial cell responses, i. e. changes of soluble adhesion levels, IL- 8 and nitrate in peripheral blood. To further elucidate the role of endothelial cells in this type of inflammation, in vitro experiments were performed. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured and subsequently incubated with a swine dust extract. Cytokine secretion, expression of surface adhesion molecules and neutrophil adherence increased following swine dust stimulation, indicating that this dust directly induces neutrophil/endothelial cell interactions of importance for neutrophil accumulation in the airways...|$|R

ObjectivesWe sought to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of HDM-SLIT in children with isolated allergic rhinitis-conjunctivitis mono-sensitized to HDM without asthma symptoms. MethodsTwenty-two children (aged 5 – 10 years) with perennial AR and conjunctivitis symptoms mono-sensitized to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae were enrolled. During a 2 months run-in period, symptom and medication scores, lung functions, bronchial <b>hyperreactivity,</b> <b>nasal</b> provocation and skin prick tests were evaluated. Subjects were randomized to active or placebo using a double-blind method. A total of eighteen subjects were randomised to receive either active SLIT or placebo for 12 months. Daily symptom and medication scores, baseline lung functions, bronchial <b>hyperreactivity,</b> <b>nasal</b> provocation and skin prick tests were recorded and re-evaluated at the end of treatment. ResultsAfter one year of treatment, no significant differences were detected in the between groups and within group comparisons based on total rhinitis symptom/medication scores (p >  0. 05). Skin reactivity to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus was significantly reduced in HDM-SLIT compared to placebo group (p =  0. 018). A significant reduction in nasal sensitivity was observed in SLIT group after one year treatment when compared to baseline (p =  0. 04). Total conjunctivitis symptoms were reduced significantly in both active and lacebo group at the end of treatment compared to baseline. The proportion of patients with non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity increased to almost 3 -fold in placebo group compared to baseline.

However, the functional consequences of capsaicin treatment on nasal nerve activation and the association between the reduction in <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity</b> (NHR) and response to capsaicin treatment remain unknown. Objective: We sought to {{study the effects of}} capsaicin nasal spray on the afferent innervation of the nasal mucosa by monitoring trigeminal nerve activity in patients with IR and healthy control (HC) subjects. Methods: A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial with capsaicin nasal spray was performed involving 33 patients with IR and 12 HC subjects. Before and at 4, 12, and 26 weeks after treatment, nasal mucosal potentials (NMPs) were measured while exposing the nasal mucosa of patients with IR and HC subjects to aerosols with increasing doses of the chemical irritants allyl isothiocyanate (AITC; also known as mustard oil) or capsaicin. The threshold for each compound was determined for each subject. The results of the NMP measurements were evaluated in parallel with the therapeutic response, visual analog scale scores for nasal symptoms, self-reported NHR, and mRNA expression of PGP 9. 5; TRPV 1; transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A, receptor 1 (TRPA 1); TRPV 4; transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M, member 8 (TRPM 8); and nerve growth factor (NGF) in nasal biopsy specimens. Results: AITC {{turned out to be the}} best stimulus because the coughing induced by capsaicin interfered with measurements. At baseline, the threshold for evoking changes in NMPs based on AITC was significantly lower for patients with IR compared with HC subjects (P =. 0423). Capsaicin treatment of IR patients increased the threshold for the response to AITC at 4 and 12 weeks compared with placebo (P =. 0406 and P =. 0325, respectively), which returned to baseline by week 26 (P =. 0611). This increase correlated with changes in visual analog scale major symptom (P =. 0004) and total symptom (P =. 0018) scores. IR patients with self-reported NHR at baseline showed a trend to being better responders to capsaicin treatment compared with patients with IR but without NHR (P =. 10). Conclusion: The lower threshold for AITC based on NMPs in patients with IR compared with HC subjects and the increased threshold for AITC after capsaicin treatment in patients with IR demonstrate the crucial role of TRPA 1 and TRPV 1 in IR pathophysiology. The strong correlation between the increase in AITC threshold in patients with IR and symptom reduction after capsaicin treatment demonstrates the clinical relevance of these finding...|$|R
40|$|Background Although sublingual {{immunotherapy}} (SLIT) {{has been}} demonstrated to be a safe and efficient treatment in children with seasonal allergic rhinitis (AR), {{there is little evidence}} on the efficacy of SLIT with house-dust-mite (HDM) extract in children with isolated perennial AR. Objectives We sought to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of HDM-SLIT in children with isolated allergic rhinitis-conjunctivitis mono-sensitized to HDM without asthma symptoms. Methods Twenty-two children (aged 5 - 10 years) with perennial AR and conjunctivitis symptoms mono-sensitized to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae were enrolled. During a 2 months run-in period, symptom and medication scores, lung functions, bronchial <b>hyperreactivity,</b> <b>nasal</b> provocation and skin prick tests were evaluated. Subjects were randomized to active or placebo using a double-blind method. A total of eighteen subjects were randomised to receive either active SLIT or placebo for 12 months. Daily symptom and medication scores, baseline lung functions, bronchial <b>hyperreactivity,</b> <b>nasal</b> provocation and skin prick tests were recorded and re-evaluated at the end of treatment. Results After one year of treatment, no significant differences were detected in the between groups and within group comparisons based on total rhinitis symptom/medication scores (p > 0. 05). Skin reactivity to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus was significantly reduced in HDM-SLIT compared to placebo group (p = 0. 018). A significant reduction in nasal sensitivity was observed in SLIT group after one year treatment when compared to baseline (p = 0. 04). Total conjunctivitis symptoms were reduced significantly in both active and lacebo group at the end of treatment compared to baseline. The proportion of patients with non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity increased to almost 3 -fold in placebo group compared to baseline. Conclusion HDM-SLIT was not superior to placebo in reducing isolated rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms within 12 months of treatment. However, HDM-SLIT has a modulating effect on allergen-specific nasal and skin reactivity in isolated perennial AR children.

40|$|Rinitis je upala nosne sluznice različite etiologije, uključujući infekciju, alergiju ili hiperreaktivni odgovor na raznovrsne podražaje iz okoline. Praćen je simptomima opstrukcije, hipersekrecije, kihanja ili svrbeža nosa. Klasifikacije rinitisa se oslanjaju na etiologiju i težinu simptoma. Iako je s epidemiološkog gledišta najčešći virusni rinitis u sklopu obične prehlade, javnozdravstveno se značenje prvenstveno fokusira na kronični rinitis, alergijski i nealergijski. Alergijski rinitis se etiološki dijeli na sezonski i perenijalni, a prema trajanju simptoma na intermitentni i perzistentni (do 4 tjedna ili do 4 dana u tjednu, odnosno dulje od 4 tjedna ili više od 4 tjedana). Nazalni simptomi kod nealergijskog hiperreaktivnog rinitisa mogu biti izazvani samo kratkotrajno, nosnom iritacijom samo u trenucima ekspozicije okidaču refleksnog odgovora. Zbog odsutnosti značajnijih razina upalnih elemenata u nosnoj sluznici, u nekim oblicima nealergijskog neinfektivnog rinitisa, takav se odgovor nosne sluznice na iritanse svrstava u kronične rinopatije, koji se u posljednje vrijeme definira najčešće kao idiopatska rinopatija. U takvim rinitisima ključna je uloga proteina koji reguliraju ionske kanale u nosnoj sluznici, te neuralnih refleksa, koji dovode do kongestije, hipersekrecije ili kihanja. Terapija kroničnih rinitisa, alergijskih i nealergijskih, temelji se na izbjegavanju alergena, odnosno okidača te na primjeni toalete nosnih šupljina, antihistaminika, topikalnih kortikosteroida, antikolinergika i imunoterapije. Rhinitis is a {{very common}} {{disorder}} caused by inflammation or irritation of nasal mucosa. Dominant symptoms are nasal obstruction; however, in some patients, runny nose, excessive sneezing or nasal itch {{may be the most}} bothersome symptoms. The most common causes of nasal inflammation are viral infections and allergic response to airborne allergens. Response to irritants may cause similar symptoms, although signs of inflammation may not always be present. Viral rhinitis is lasting up to 10 days and {{it is part of the}} common cold syndrome. In short-lived rhinitis, lasting for 7 to 10 days, sometimes it is not easy to differentiate between the potential causes of the disorder, if general symptoms of infection like fever and malaise are not present. In long-living rhinitis, it is important to differentiate between infectious, allergic, non-allergic non-infectious rhinitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis. Itch and ocular symptoms are more common in allergic rhinitis, while other symptoms like nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea and sneezing may affect patients with allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. Patients with allergic rhinitis often have symptoms after exposure to irritants, temperature and humidity changes, like patients with non-allergic rhinitis, and such exposure may sometimes cause more severe symptoms than exposure to allergens. Sensitivity to a non-specific trigger is usually called non-specific <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity.</b> Allergic rhinitis occurs due to immunoglobulin E (IgE) interaction with allergen in contact with nasal mucosa in a sensitized patient. Sensitization to certain airborne allergen, like pollens, dust, molds, animal dander, etc. usually occurs in families with allergy background, which is helpful in making diagnosis in patients who have rhinitis in a certain period of the year, or aggravation of nasal symptoms occurs in the environment typical of certain allergen. The diagnosis is clinically confirmed by proving sensitivity to certain allergen on skin prick test, and by proving specific antibody IgE in patient serum. Allergic rhinitis is categorized according to sensitivity to allergens that occur seasonally, like pollens, or to allergens that are present all year round, like house dust mite, molds and animal dander, into seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis. Allergy to pollens causes the same mechanism of inflammation in response to allergens, which is the result of allergen binding to specific IgE antibody; however, patients with pollen allergy usually complain more of sneezing and runny nose, whereas patients with allergy to perennial allergens more often complain of obstruction, with the episodes of sneezing and runny nose occurring only when exposed to higher concentrations of allergens (house cleaning, around pets). Treatment includes avoidance of allergens, medical treatment and immunotherapy (allergy vaccines, tablets with allergens). Avoidance of allergens means reduction of environmental allergen load to the respiratory system including workplace, which is not easy to accomplish. Medical treatment is usually necessary to control symptoms, and it includes antihistamines, nasal or in tablets, and nasal glucocorticoids (steroids). Antihistamines should be second generation, which do not cause sedation, and such treatment shows more efficacy on runny nose, sneezing and nasal itch than on nasal stuffiness. Nasal steroids are more potent in improving nasal patency than antihistamines, and are at least as potent in the control of all other nasal and ocular symptoms. Nasal patency may be improved by nasal or oral decongestants, but such treatment should be reduced to as short period as possible, since after several days of using nasal decongestants rebound congestion may occur and patients will need nasal decongestants to improve nasal airways even when allergens are not around anymore...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Previous {{functional}} imaging studies {{provide evidence}} for neural integration of human emotions and autonomic bodily responses. However it remains unclear how primary autonomic disorders influence emotional processing. The present functional MRI study investigates how heightened bodily reactivity shape excessive emotional responses. Methods We recruited patients with autonomic <b>hyperreactivity</b> (postural tachycardia <b>syndrome,</b> POTS) and age-matched normal controls. Participants were scanned with heart rate recording when judging emotional pictures, consisting of five emotion-specific categories of faces and scences (happy, angry, disgust, sad, and neutral) taken from the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF) and the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). After scanning, participants completed questionnaires for anxiety (STAI), depression (BDI-II), and panic disorders (PDSS). Results The scores of the questionnaires indicated that the POTS patients showed significantly higher state and trait anxiety, higher depressive status, and {{nearly half of the}} patients had past experience of pacic attacks. At the physiological level, the POTS patients showed an excessive rise in heart rate from onset of each stimulus presentation when compared to controls. The results of the fMRI data showed much greater deactivation within ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC, BA 11, Figure 1 & 2) and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 9) in the patients compared to controls. In contrast, greater activation in midline structures; precuneus (BA 7), anterior prefrontal cortex (BA 10), and rostral anterior cingulate cortex, were found in the patients compared to controls. Further investigations showed that globus pallidus (GP), pons, and VMPFC were significantly correlated with higher state anxiety in the patients. Causal mediation analysis revealed that the activation in VMPFC provoked the activation in GP mediated via the level of state anxiety in the patients. Conclusions Overall findings suggest that hyperreactive bodily states trigger disruptive emotional status by increased attenuation of activity within VMPFC impacting on GP function. Our study highlights the possible neural mechanisms for understanding emotional disturbance in autonomic hyperreactivity disorder...|$|R
40|$|In chapter I the {{currently}} known causes for nonallergic noninfectious rhinitis and possible treatments are summarised. Also possible pathophysiological mechanisms underlying idiopathic rhinitis (IR) are discussed. In chapter II {{the aims of}} the studies are presented. This thesis comprises studies aimed at the therapeutic potential and safety of intranasal capsaicin in IR patients, developing a patient and physician friendly, effective intranasal capsaicin treatment regimen for IR and the histological analysis of the nasal mucosa of IR patients in order to find an explanation for the therapeutic effect of capsaicin and the underlying pathophysiology of IR. In chapter III the efficacy of intranasal capsaicin spray in the treatment of IR patients was studied. Several authors described capsaicin, the pungent substance in red-pepper, as an efficacious therapy for IR. Repeated intranasal capsaicin application induces peptide depletion and specific degeneration of the unmyelinated sensory C-fibers in the nasal mucosa. We performed a double-blind placebo (NaCl 0. 9 %) controlled study with 25 IR patients. Daily record charts (DRC) and visual analogue scales (VAS) were used for clinical evaluation. Nasal lavages were obtained before, during and after treatment. There was a significant and long-term reduction in the VAS scores in the capsaicin group. No significant difference was found between the placebo and capsaicin treated groups for the mean group concentrations of leukotriene (LT) C 4 / D 4 / E 4, prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2), and tryptase. The levels of mast cell mediators, tryptase and PGD 2, and leukotrienes, mediators derived from a variety of inflammatory cells, were low at baseline and comparable with levels observed in nasal lavages obtained from normals. As involvement of inflammation could not be demonstrated, {{it is not surprising that}} capsaicin has no effect on inflammatory mediators. This suggests that inflammatory cells do not play a major part in the pathogenesis of IR. In chapter IV we conducted a double-blind double-dummy parallel group trial to determine whether a more practical capsaicin application schedule is equally effective as the one described in chapter III. In daily practice, this application regimen of intranasal capsaicin application once every second or third day for a total of 7 days proved to be impractical because of the large number of visits required in a short period of time. Thirty patients were randomized into two different treatment regimens: one group received capsaicin five times the first day at one-hour intervals. This was followed by a placebo dummy once every second or third day for a total of five treatments 2 weeks after the capsaicin application (group A). The other group (B) received the placebo dummy five times on the first day followed by capsaicin once every second or third day for a total of five treatments 2 weeks after the placebo application. The VAS scores for overall nasal symptoms, rhinorrhea and nasal blockage showed significant decrease after the start of treatment in both groups, with a significantly steeper decrease in group A. A significant reduction in cold dry air dose responsiveness was also found up to 9 months after therapy in both groups, reflecting a decrease in <b>nasal</b> <b>hyperreactivity.</b> No significant changes in safety data (smell, blood pressure, heart rate) were found. We conclude that local capsaicin nasal spray significantly reduces nasal complaints in IR patients and that five treatments of capsaicin on a single day is at least as effective as five treatments of capsaicin in 2 weeks, and even more effective in the reduction of nasal complaints measured with VAS. We also conclude that intranasal capsaicin seems safe to use. In chapter V nasal mucosa inflammatory cell densities of IR patients are studied and compared with normals. Mucosal inflammatory cellular infiltrates are correlated with nasal complaints in symptomatic allergic rhinitis. Some authors suggest inflammation of neurogenic or immunogenic nature as the underlying pathophysiology for IR. We examined whether inflammatory cells are involved in the pathogenesis of IR. Nasal biopsies were taken of 65 patients with significant nasal complaints and 20 controls without nasal complaints. Inflammatory cells were quantified, using monoclonal antibodies directed against lymphocytes, antigen presenting cells, eosinophils, macrophages, monocytes, mast cells and other IgE-positive cells. No significant differences were found, for any cell, between IR patients and controls. We conclude that inflammatory cells do not seem to play an important role in this meticulously characterised group of IR patients. In chapter VI the long term effects of capsaicin spray on the nasal mucosa are studied. Capsaicin has been shown previously to reduce nasal complaints in patients with IR. Proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms for IR include a chronic inflammatory disorder of antigenic or neurogenic nature as well as the possibility of a functional neuronal disorder. We hypothesized that the beneficial effect of capsaicin might be the result of a down regulation of inflammation (by a reduction of inflammatory cells) or through a modulation of neural tissue density. Patients were treated with either a placebo or capsaicin spray solution once every second or third day for a total of seven treatments. Both sides were treated each visit. Biopsies were taken before, 2 weeks after, 3 months after and 9 months after the treatment period. Immunohistochemical staining of the biopsy specimen was performed to ascertain the effect of treatment on immunocompetent cell densities (quantitative) and neural tissue densities (semiquantitative) in the nasal mucosa. Nasal complaints were significantly reduced in the capsaicin treated group (Chapter III). The number of lymphocytes, antigen presenting cells, eosinophils, macrophages, monocytes, mast cells and other IgE-positive cells did not significantly differ between the capsaicin and the placebo group. No significant differences between both groups were found in pan-neurogenic staining of nasal mucosa using neurofilament and synaptophysine. To conclude capsaicin intranasal spray does significantly improve nasal symptomatology in IR patients (shown previously), without affecting cellular homeostasis or overall neurogenic staining upto 9 months after treatment. Immunocompetent cells are not involved in IR. In chapter VII we tried to get more insight into the pathophysiologic mechanism of IR and the direct mode of action of capsaicin on nasal mucosa cell counts and neurogenic staining. To our knowledge data concerning the provocation effect of capsaicin on nasal cellular homeostasis in humans is limited to lavage studies following a single capsaicin application in allergic patients and healthy controls. We performed a double-blind placebo controlled nasal biopsy study in 30 strictly selected and well-defined IR patients challenged with either capsaicin or placebo. Biopsies were taken at baseline 2 weeks before provocation and 15 minutes and 1 hour after a single provocation with capsaicin or placebo. The cell densities of CD 3, CD 8, CD 25, C-Kit, chymase, tryptase, BB 1, IgE and BMK 13 and the neuronal staining with synaptophysine, neurofilament and VRL- 1 were studied in both layers of the nasal mucosa. No significant difference in nasal mucosa cell counts and neurogenic staining were found 15 minutes and 1 hour after provocation. Only for CD 3 in the epithelium 1 hour after provocation a significant higher cell count was found in the capsaicin group using the Mann-Whitney U test. Due to multiple testing this p-value of 0. 011 for CD 3 could have been easily caused by chance. We conclude that capsaicin, after local anaesthesia of the nasal mucosa, does not affect cellular homeostasis or neurogenic staining 15 minutes and 1 hour after nasal provocation in this double-blind placebo controlled biopsy study. This strengthens us in our idea that inflammatory cells do not play a role in the mode of action of capsaicin and the aetiology of IR...|$|R
