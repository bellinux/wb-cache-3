25|$|The Kiev Pechersk Lavra caverns are a {{very complex}} system of narrow {{underground}} corridors (about 1-1½ metres wide and 2-2½ metres high), along with numerous living quarters and underground chapels. In 1051, the monk Anthony settled in an old cave in a hill near the Kiev Pechersk Lavra. This cave received additions including corridors and a church, and is <b>now</b> <b>what</b> we know as the Far Caves. In 1057, Anthony moved to a cave near the Upper Lavra, now called the Near Caves.|$|E
25|$|<b>Now</b> <b>what</b> is an atom? Conventionally an atom {{is either}} a {{constant}} (0 or 1) or a variable x'i where 0 ≤ i < n. For the proof technique here it is convenient to define atoms instead to be n-ary operations n'f'i, which although treated here as atoms nevertheless mean the same as ordinary terms of the exact form n'f'i(x0,...,x'n-1) (exact in that the variables must listed in the order shown without repetition or omission). This is not a restriction because atoms of this form include all the ordinary atoms, namely the constants 0 and 1, which arise here as the n-ary operations n'f0 and n'f−1 for each n (abbreviating 22n−1 to −1), and the variables x0,...,x'n-1 {{as can be seen}} from the truth tables where x0 appears as both the unary operation 1f2 and the binary operation 2f10 while x1 appears as 2f12.|$|E

25|$|After {{a lot of}} songwriting {{sessions}} in Europe, Deep Purple decided to record through the summer of 2012, and the band announced the release of their new studio album in 2013. Steve Morse announced to French magazine Rock Hard that the new studio album would be produced by the highly respected Bob Ezrin, {{who is known for}} his works with Alice Cooper, Kiss, and Pink Floyd. On 16 July 2012, the band's co-founding member and former organ player, Jon Lord, died in London, aged 71. In December 2012, Roger Glover revealed in an interview that the band has completed work on 14 songs for a new studio album, with 11 or 12 tracks set to appear on the final album to be released in 2013. On 26 February 2013, the title of the band's nineteenth studio album was announced as <b>Now</b> <b>What?!,</b> which was recorded and mixed in Nashville, Tennessee, and released on 26 April 2013.|$|E

500|$|According to Frederick Nolan, in {{his book}} about the pair's music, [...] "Reexamined today, Allegros main fault {{seems to have been}} that it was ahead of its time, the {{integration}} of story and music far too advanced even for audiences now becoming accustomed to musicals which actually had stories." [...] Sondheim noted, [...] "Allegro was an attempt to use epic theatre in contemporary musical theatre. [...] It used a Greek chorus, and tried {{to tell the story of}} a life, not through events but through generalities. [...] This is <b>now</b> <b>what</b> would be called a Brechtian approach." ...|$|E
500|$|The second single {{from the}} album, [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] faced {{criticism}} {{as well as}} support from groups concerned with pregnancy and abortion for its theme of a girl getting pregnant and then deciding to continue the pregnancy rather than ending it. Alfred Moran who was {{the executive director of}} Planned Parenthood of New York City, criticized the song, fearing that it would undermine efforts to promote birth control among adolescents and that it would encourage teenage pregnancy. Susan Carpenter-McMillan who was the president of Feminists for Life (FFL) in the U.S., accepted the song's theme as being pro-life and said that [...] "abortion is readily available on every street corner for young women. <b>Now</b> <b>what</b> Madonna is telling them is, hey, there's an alternative."

Among them I am making, I hope, life long friends, for their experiences mean everything to my self-satisfaction... As long as they fight on, I have no desire to return home, for I feel I belong here... I have learned much in these brief three months about life and living.

500|$|By {{the end of}} 1898 Dresser {{reported}} that nearly one million copies of sheet music would soon be sold, making [...] "Wabash" [...] a [...] "sensation", the [...] "great hit of the day." [...] In a newspaper interview Dresser said, [...] "I can’t tell you just how much I have cleared off of the song, but the $50,000 estimate I have seen in some papers is very modest. You see I am a publisher {{as well as a}} composer and have a big printing house of my own in New York. I also write the words for all my songs, dictate the circumstances and stage settings for their public introductions, write my own ads, and sometimes sing my own songs. <b>Now</b> <b>what</b> {{do you think of that}} for a monopoly. Eh?" [...] Dresser earned a substantial income from the song, including royalties through the sale of sheet music.|$|E
500|$|In contrast, groups {{opposed to}} {{abortion}} saw [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] as a positive, pro-life song. Susan Carpenter-McMillan, {{the president of}} the California chapter of Feminists for Life (FFL) in the US, said that [...] "abortion is readily available on every street corner for young women. <b>Now</b> <b>what</b> Madonna is telling them is, hey, there's an alternative." [...] Tipper Gore, a founder of the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), who a year earlier denounced Madonna for the sexual lyrical content of her single [...] "Dress You Up", and had led a campaign against explicit content in music, commended Madonna for speaking candidly about such a serious subject and important social issue. When speaking of the song, Gore said [...] "the song speaks to a serious subject with a sense of urgency and sensitivity in both the lyrics and Madonna's rendition. It also speaks to the fact that there's got to be more support and more communication in families about this problem, and anything that fosters that I applaud." ...|$|E

500|$|The film {{switches}} the infertility from male {{to female}} but never explains its cause: environmental destruction and divine punishment are considered. This unanswered question (and {{others in the}} film) {{have been attributed to}} Cuarón's dislike for expository film: [...] "There's a kind of cinema I detest, which is a cinema that is about exposition and explanations... It's become <b>now</b> <b>what</b> I call a medium for lazy readers... Cinema is a hostage of narrative. [...] And I'm very good at narrative as a hostage of cinema." [...] Cuarón's disdain for back-story and exposition led him to use the concept of female infertility as a [...] "metaphor for the fading sense of hope". [...] The [...] "almost mythical" [...] Human Project is turned into a [...] "metaphor for the possibility of the evolution of the human spirit, the evolution of human understanding." [...] Without dictating how the audience should feel {{by the end of the}} film, Cuarón encourages viewers to come to their own conclusions about the sense of hope depicted in the final scenes: [...] "We wanted the end to be a glimpse of a possibility of hope, for the audience to invest their own sense of hope into that ending. So if you're a hopeful person you'll see a lot of hope, and if you're a bleak person you'll see a complete hopelessness at the end." ...|$|E
500|$|Jacob Acaye, {{the former}} child soldier {{featured}} in the film, supported the video and defended its makers. In response to Ugandans saying that the film was out-of-date, Jacob stated that, [...] "It is not too late, because all this fighting and suffering {{is still going on}} elsewhere. Until now, the war that was going on has been a silent war. People did not really know about it. <b>Now</b> <b>what</b> was happening in Gulu is still going on elsewhere in the Central African Republic and in Congo. What about the people who are suffering over there? They are going through what we were going through." [...] It was noted by Los Angeles Times journalists Lindsay Branham and Jocelyn Kelly that a number of people living in the areas where the LRA is currently active have previously called for attention and advocacy to be directed at the issue. Julien Marneffe, a worker for Catholic Relief Services in Goma said [...] "it's been an undeniable success -- and one all humanitarian organizations working in this area can be happy about," [...] but added to [...] "be careful not to oversimplify the issue" [...] and worried that the interest might be short lived when [...] "another crisis or another video will be the next online trend, and I fear that most people will forget about the problems of the LRA." ...|$|E
500|$|Only days later, Carey began posting {{irregular}} voice {{notes and}} messages on her official website: [...] "I'm {{trying to understand}} things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right <b>now.</b> <b>What</b> I'd {{like to do is}} just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [...] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself." [...] Following the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been [...] "obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly" [...] when she posted the letters. On July26, she was hospitalized, citing [...] "extreme exhaustion" [...] and a [...] "physical and emotional breakdown". News websites and programs began reporting how Carey threatened to commit suicide by slitting her wrists the night before, and how Patricia, Carey's mother, hastily called for help. When questioned regarding Carey's suicidal rumor, Berger claimed she had broken dishes out of desperation, and as a result, accidentally cut her hands and feet. Carey was inducted at an un-disclosed hospital in Connecticut, and remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public. Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records America and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both Glitter, as well as its soundtrack of the same name.|$|E
