The right to <b>non-refoulement</b> is distinct from the right to asylum. In order to respect the right to asylum states must not deport genuine refugees. In contrast, the right to <b>non-refoulement</b> allows states to transfer genuine refugees to third party countries with respectable human rights records. The portable procedural model, proposed by political philosopher Andy Lamey, emphasizes the right to <b>non-refoulement</b> by guaranteeing refugees three procedural rights (to a verbal hearing, to legal counsel, and to judicial review of detention decisions) and ensuring those rights in the constitution.

2500|$|Having {{completed}} his {{tour of duty}} at Ankara in 1957, Sharaf was posted to the Egyptian mission to the United Nations at New York City. At the United Nations, he was an alternate to his colleague Abdel Hamid Abdel-Ghani, on the 14-member country Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities. Distinguished members on the commission included Judge Philip Halpern of the United States. In January 1960, the sub-commission unanimously adopted a resolution condemning [...] "Anti-Semitism, Religious and Racial Prejudices", amongst {{the first to be}} adopted by a sub-commission at the World Organization. Sharaf attended numerous commission meetings and conferences at the UN dealing with complex legal and human rights issues like <b>non-refoulement,</b> as well as one on the essential topic of the standardization of geographical names.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 prime {{minister}} Kevin Rudd {{introduced a new}} asylum policy which meant that all asylum seekers arriving by boat would be sent offshore to Manus Island in Papua New Guinea for processing and resettlement. This included gay refugees, even though they face persecution under Papua New Guinean law with homosexual acts criminalised and a potential penalty of 14 years imprisonment. Asylum seekers are warned in an orientation presentation on arrival by the Salvation Army that [...] "Homosexuality is illegal in Papua New Guinea. People have been imprisoned or killed for performing homosexual acts." [...] This places them {{in the position of}} being required to declare their sexuality to be eligible for refugee protection yet liable to face persecution from other people and under local laws. Gay asylum seekers also face bullying, assault and sexual abuse on Manus Island from others, including officials and other refugees, due to their sexuality. Australia faces accusations from refugee advocates that it has violated its <b>non-refoulement</b> obligations under international law by exposing LGBT asylum seekers to such dangers. After the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea in 2016 ordered the closure of Manus Island immigration detention centre on the basis that it breached constitutional guarantees of liberty, the Australian government confirmed the closure but not {{what would happen to the}} detainees.|$|E
5000|$|Article 3 of the 1984 Convention against Torture {{and other}} Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment held that <b>non-refoulement</b> emanated from larger protections from torture and inhumane treatment. This {{represented}} a major shift, as these protections, and therefore <b>non-refoulement</b> provisions, are considered absolute rights.|$|E

5000|$|... #Subtitle level 2: Examples of Violations of the Principle of <b>Non-Refoulement</b> ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Non-refoulement</b> {{presents}} an inherent conflict with state sovereignty, as it infringes on a state's right to exercise control over its own borders {{and those who}} reside within them. In legal proceedings immediately following World War II, <b>non-refoulement</b> {{was viewed as a}} distinct right which could be abridged under certain circumstances, such as those spelled out in Article 3, Section 2 of the 1951 Convention.|$|E
50|$|The Declaration reaffirms the {{importance}} of the right to asylum, the principle of <b>non-refoulement</b> and {{the importance}} of finding durable solutions.|$|E
5000|$|The Australian Government {{has been}} accused by the UNHCR and more than fifty Australian legal {{scholars}} of violating the principle of <b>non-refoulement,</b> by returning 41 Tamil and Singhalese refugees to the Sri Lankan Navy in June or July 2014, as part of Operation Sovereign Borders immigration and border protection policy. [...] This action was followed in September 2014 by a Bill tabled in the Australian Parliament that would remove Australia's <b>non-refoulement</b> obligations, and sought to reinterpret Australia's international treaty obligations.|$|E
50|$|These are the {{accepted}} terms and criteria as principles and a fundamental {{part in the}} 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees <b>non-refoulement</b> order.|$|E
5000|$|... {{forcibly}} return or [...] "refoul" [...] {{refugees to}} the country they've fled from (Article 33). It is widely accepted that the prohibition of forcible return is part of customary international law. This means that even States that are not party to the 1951 Refugee Convention must respect the principle of <b>non-refoulement.</b> Therefore, States are obligated under the Convention and under customary international law to respect the principle of <b>non-refoulement.</b> If and when this principle is threatened, UNHCR can respond by intervening with relevant authorities, and if it deems necessary, will inform the public.|$|E
5000|$|Article 22(8) of the 1969 American Convention on Human Rights {{establishes}} {{danger to}} an asylum seeker's [...] "right to life or personal freedom" [...] as the threshold for <b>non-refoulement</b> among American states.|$|E
50|$|Freedom of {{domicile}} {{anywhere in}} the country (art. 24) and protection against extradition without consent (art. 25) are rights reserved to Swiss citizens. However, foreigners enjoy the guarantee of <b>non-refoulement</b> provided by article 25.|$|E
50|$|Strict:This {{interpretation}} {{holds that}} <b>non-refoulement</b> laws only apply to asylum seekers who have physically entered a state's borders. State's using this interpretation often enact {{policies and procedures}} designed to block asylum seekers from reaching their borders.|$|E
50|$|Refugee law and {{international}} human rights law are closely connected in content but differ in their function. The main difference of their function {{is the way in}} which international refugee law considers state sovereignty while {{international human rights}} law do not. One of the main aspects of international refugee law is <b>non-refoulement</b> which is the basic idea that a country cannot send back a person to their country of origin if they will face endangerment upon return. In this case, a certain level of sovereignty is taken away from a country. This basic right of <b>non-refoulement</b> conflicts with the basic right of sovereign state to expel any undocumented aliens.|$|E
5000|$|Though the {{principle}} of <b>non-refoulement</b> is a non-negotiable aspect of international law, states have interpreted this article in various ways and have constructed their legal responses to asylum seeker in corresponding manners. The four most common interpretations are: ...|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, the European Commission on Human Rights {{recognized}} <b>non-refoulement</b> as {{a subsidiary}} of prohibitions on torture. As the ban on torture is jus cogens, this linkage rendered the prohibition on refoulement absolute and challenged the legality of refoulement {{for the purposes of}} state security. Through court cases (see Soering v. United Kingdom and Chahal v. United Kingdom) and interpretations of various international treaties in the 1980s, the European Commission on Human Rights shifted preference away from preserving state sovereignty and towards protecting persons who might be refouled. This interpretation permitted no abridgments of <b>non-refoulement</b> protections, even if the state was concerned a refugee may be a terrorist or pose other immediate threats to the state.|$|E
50|$|<b>Non-refoulement</b> is {{the right}} not to be {{returned}} to a place of persecution and is the foundation for international refugee law, as outlined in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Both the right to <b>non-refoulement</b> and the right to asylum have taken centre stage in recent debates over the treatment of refugees. A central worry about the right to asylum is that it can limit a states power to handle a mass influx of refugees. Processing asylum applications can take a considerable amount of time, and this amount rises with the amount of refugees applying. This creates an incentive for more refugees to apply, since they are allowed to stay in the country during the application process. One potential {{solution to the problem of}} mass influx is proposed by U.S.-based political philosopher Andy Lamey. Lamey proposes a portable procedural model that focuses on the right to <b>non-refoulement.</b> Crucially, the procedural rights defended by this model can be applied outside national borders, within any rights respecting country; this allows the burden of mass influx to be shared by a plurality of countries without violating the procedural rights of the refugee.|$|E
50|$|The United States {{and other}} {{countries}} that allow preclearance {{have been accused of}} being motivated also by the desire to prevent the arrival of asylum seekers, who are otherwise protected under the 1951 Refugee Convention's <b>non-refoulement</b> provisions once they arrive at their destination.|$|E
5000|$|Per Article 3(2) of the 1957 European Convention on Extradition and Article 4(5) of the 1981 Inter-American Convention on Extradition, the {{principle}} of <b>non-refoulement</b> also applies to extradition {{cases in which the}} person believes they will be tried or biased based specifically on one of the protected factors.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Non-refoulement</b> (...) is a {{fundamental}} principle of international law which forbids a country receiving asylum seekers from returning them to {{a country in which}} they would be in likely danger of persecution based on [...] "race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion" [...] (See Article 33 below). Unlike political asylum, which applies to those who can prove a well-grounded fear of persecution based on certain category of persons, <b>non-refoulement</b> refers to the generic repatriation of people, including refugees into war zones and other disaster locales. It is a principle of customary international law, as it applies to states that are not parties to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees or its 1967 Protocol. It is also a principle of the trucial law of nations.|$|E
50|$|It is {{debatable}} whether <b>non-refoulement</b> is a jus cogens (peremptory norm) of international law. If so, international law permits no abridgments for any purpose or under any circumstances. The debate over this matter was rekindled following the September 11, 2001 terror {{attacks in the}} United States as well as contemporary attacks in Europe.|$|E
5000|$|Strict, with {{a narrow}} reading: This {{interpretation}} holds that only certain refugees are legally entitled to <b>non-refoulement</b> protection. If the country receiving an asylum seeker does not find that their [...] "life or freedom would be threatened" [...] by refoulement, this interpretation holds {{that they can be}} legitimately returned to their country of origin.|$|E
50|$|Article 3 of the 1933 Convention {{relating}} to the International Status of Refugees contained the first mention of <b>non-refoulement</b> in international law and prevented party states from expelling legally-residing refugees or turning away refugees at the borders of their home countries. This treaty was ratified by only a few states and gained little traction in international law.|$|E
50|$|Malta has in {{the past}} {{considered}} adopting a push-back policy towards approaching migrants, pushing their boats back to Libya. Such a policy, contrary to international law and the principle of <b>non-refoulement,</b> has been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights in a case against Italy, as it does not allow prospective asylum seekers to file their claims for international protection.|$|E
50|$|Today, the {{principle}} of <b>non-refoulement</b> ostensibly protects persons from being expelled from countries that are signatories to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, the 1967 Protocol Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, or the 1984 Convention Against Torture. This, however, has not prevented certain signatory countries from skirting the international law principle and repatriating or expelling persons {{into the hands of}} potential persecutors.|$|E
5000|$|The rights {{promulgated by}} the Convention {{generally}} still stand today. Some {{have argued that}} the complex nature of 21st century refugee relationships calls for a new treaty that recognizes the evolving nature of the nation-state, population displacement, and modern warfare. [...] Nevertheless, ideas like the principle of <b>non-refoulement</b> (Article 33) are still applied today, with the 1951 Convention being the hallmark of such rights.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, Operation Sovereign Borders {{is still}} in effect, with {{international}} law allowing Australia to deny any vessel entry into their territorial waters, as long as Australia does not return these asylum seekers to a place in which they may be threatened. Australia therefore recognises there to be no violation of their international obligations, as refusing entry of asylum seekers does not equate to a breach of <b>non-refoulement.</b>|$|E
5000|$|By the 19th century, Bhutan had {{developed}} a slave trade with Sikkim and Tibet. During this time, the kidnapping of British subjects as slaves, {{as well as the}} repatriation of escaped Bhutanese slaves, became major points of contention amid rising hostilities between Bhutan and British India. The British position was to allow slaves to return of their own will, but not to repatriate them to Bhutan. (Cf. <b>non-refoulement)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Following {{terror attacks}} in the United States and Europe, states have renewed calls for {{permitting}} refoulement {{in the interest of}} national security, as repatriation is the most effective method of dispatching refugees thought to present a credible threat. Furthermore, newer treaties typically include specific obligations that prevent refoulement under essentially any circumstances. These factors have led individual states and the European Union to seek ways around <b>non-refoulement</b> protections that balance security and human rights.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, Parker intervened {{on behalf}} of Salvadoran rebel {{commander}} Nidia Diaz, captured after being shot by government forces {{during the civil war}} in that country. Diaz' imprisonment and subsequently arranged surgery were widely publicized when actor Mike Farrell of M*A*S*H* fame assisted a neurosurgeon during the operation. Throughout the war, Ms. Parker participated in investigative delegations and testified in numerous forums about humanitarian law violations, as well as the principle of <b>non-refoulement.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other {{examples}} accepted or {{claimed as}} {{customary international law}} include the principle of <b>non-refoulement</b> and immunity of visiting foreign heads of state. United Nations Security Council in 1993 adopted Geneva conventions as customary international law because since the time being it has transformed itself into customary international law. If any treaty or law has been called as customary international law then parties which have not ratified said treaty will be bound to observe its provisions in good faith.|$|E
5000|$|Tanzania's actions {{during the}} 1994 {{genocide}} in Rwanda have been {{alleged to have}} violated the <b>non-refoulement</b> principle. During {{the height of the}} crisis when the refugee flows rose {{to the level of a}} [...] "mass exodus," [...] the Tanzanian government closed its borders to a group of more than 50,000 Rwandan refugees who were fleeing genocidal violence. In 1996, before Rwanda had reached an appropriate level of stability, around 500,000 refugees were returned to Rwanda from Zaire.|$|E
50|$|Many Shi'a Iraqis fleeing Saddam Hussein in the 1990s {{moved to}} Lebanon. A 2007 article by the journal Middle East Report {{reported}} that Lebanon hosted around 40,000 Iraqi refugees. About 80% of Iraqi refugees live in Lebanon's capital of Beirut, contrary {{to many other}} Middle Eastern countries where Iraqi refugees are entirely concentrated in an urban center. Lebanon has instituted a policy of <b>non-refoulement.</b> Refugees living in Lebanon cannot be forcibly deported if their lives will be in danger in their home countries. Like in other Middle Eastern host countries, Iraqi refugees in Lebanon face {{the negative effects of}} unemployment and poverty as they cannot obtain work visas.|$|E
