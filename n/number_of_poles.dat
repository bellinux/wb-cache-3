5|$|In German-occupied Poland {{the task}} of rescuing Jews was {{especially}} difficult and dangerous. All household members were punished by death if a Jew was found concealed in their home or on their property. It is estimated that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poles</b> who {{were killed by the}} Nazis for aiding Jews was as high as tens of thousands, 704 of whom were posthumously honored with medals.|$|E

5|$|The Second Legion also {{suffered}} heavily; {{particularly in the}} first battles on the Adige (26 March– 5 April 1799) where {{it is estimated that}} it lost about half to two thirds of its complement of 4,000 men. Its commander, General Franciszek Rymkiewicz, was killed at the Battle of Magnano on 5 April. The remainder of the Second Legion became part of the garrison at Mantua, which was soon placed under siege by the Austrians. Finally, {{at the end of the}} Siege of Mantua (April–July), the French commander François-Philippe de Foissac-Latour decided to release Polish soldiers– then under Wielhorski– into Austrian custody as the Austrians claimed them to be deserters. This marked the end of the Second Legion, as only a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poles</b> were able to evade capture (the French were allowed to withdraw most of their forces under the condition that they would remain neutral).|$|E

25|$|Polish {{minorities}} are still {{present in the}} neighboring countries of Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania, {{as well as in}} other countries (see Poles for population numbers). Altogether, the number of ethnic Poles living abroad is estimated to be around 20million.

Historian Dominic Pacyga identifies the Polish influx of workers in 1886 {{as a result of}} the failed strike by the mainly German and Irish workers that year. The union was further weakened by yellow dog contracts forced on returning workers, and by the supply of cheap Polish labor.|$|E

25|$|Some {{estimates}} put the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poles</b> {{involved in}} rescue {{at up to}} 3 million, and credit Poles with saving up to around 450,000 Jews from certain death. The rescue efforts were aided {{by one of the}} largest anti-Nazi resistance movements in Europe, the Polish Underground State and its military arm, the Armia Krajowa. Supported by the Polish Delegation, these organizations operated special units dedicated to helping Jews; of those, the most notable was Żegota Council based in Warsaw with branches in Kraków, Wilno and Lwów.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, Poland's {{population}} has decreased {{due to an}} increase in emigration and a decline in the birth rate. Since Poland's accession to the European Union, a significant <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poles</b> have emigrated, primarily to the United Kingdom, Germany and Ireland in search of better work opportunities abroad. With better economic conditions and Polish salaries at 70% of the EU average in 2016, this trend started to decrease in the 2010s and workforce became needed in the country. As a result, the Polish Minister of Development Mateusz Morawiecki suggested that Poles abroad should return to Poland.|$|E

25|$|To provide {{properly}} for {{the large}} and steadily increasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poles</b> in the north-eastern part of Cleveland {{it was necessary to}} organize them into the third Polish congregation within the limits of the city. They lived too far away from St. Stanislaus Church, with which they had been affiliated, for them to conveniently either attend Mass or for their children to attend the parish school. They therefore petitioned Bishop Richard Gilmour for permission to form a new parish and build a church for their own use. In December, 1891, Monsignor Felix Boff, V.G., administrator of the diocese, granted the required permission. Those parishioners left to form St. Casimir Church in 1891.|$|E
25|$|The first {{attempts}} to use standard-frequency single-phase AC {{were made in}} Hungary {{as far back as}} 1923, by the Hungarian Kálmán Kandó on the line between Budapest-Nyugati and Alag, using 16kV at 50Hz. The locomotives carried a four-pole rotating phase converter feeding a single traction motor of the polyphase induction type at 600 to 1,100V. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>poles</b> on the 2,500hp motor could be changed using slip rings to run at one of four synchronous speeds. The tests were a success so, from 1932 until the 1960s, trains on the Budapest-Hegyeshalom line (towards Vienna) regularly used the same system. A few decades after the Second World War, the 16kV was changed to the Russian and later French 25kV system.|$|E
25|$|Germany killed 2.9 million Polish Jews, and 2.8 million ethnic Poles, {{including}} Polish academics, doctors, lawyers, nobility, {{priests and}} numerous others. It is estimated that, of pre-war Poland's Jewry, approximately 90% were killed. Throughout the occupation, {{many members of}} the Armia Krajowa, supported by the Polish government in exile, and millions of ordinary Poles – at great risk to themselves and their families – engaged in rescuing Jews from the Nazi Germans. Grouped by nationality, Poles represent the largest number of people who rescued Jews during the Holocaust. To date, 6,620 Poles have been awarded the title of Righteous Among the Nations by the State of Israel–more than any other nation. Some estimates put the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poles</b> involved in rescue efforts at up to 3 million, and credit Poles with sheltering up to 450,000 Jews.|$|E

25|$|The {{immigrant}} population in Bergen {{has changed a}} lot since 1970. As of 1 January 1986, there were 2,870 people with a non-Western immigrant background in Bergen. In 2006, this figure had increased to 14,630, so the non-Western {{immigrant population}} in Bergen was five times higher than in 1986. This is a slightly slower growth than the national average, which has sextupled during the same period. Also {{in relation to the}} total population in Bergen, the proportion of non-Westerns increased significantly. In 1986, the proportion of the total population in the municipality of non-Western background was 3.6%. In January 2006, people with a non-Western immigrant background accounted for 6 percent of the population in Bergen. The share of Western immigrants has remained stable at around 2% in the period. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poles</b> in Bergen rose from 697 in 2006 to 3,128 in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Holocaust survivors' {{views of}} Polish {{behavior}} during the War span a wide range, {{depending on their}} personal experiences. Some are very negative, based on the view of Christian Poles as passive witnesses who failed to act and aid the Jews as they were being persecuted or liquidated by the Nazis. Poles, who were also victims of Nazi crimes, were often afraid for their own and their family's lives and this fear prevented many of them from giving aid and assistance, even if some of them felt sympathy for the Jews. Emanuel Ringelblum, a Polish-Jewish historian of the Warsaw Ghetto, wrote critically of the indifferent and sometimes joyful responses in Warsaw {{to the destruction of}} Polish Jews in the Ghetto. However, despite that, as another scholar (Gunnar S. Paulsson) in his work on the Jews of Warsaw has demonstrated, Polish citizens of Warsaw managed to support and hide the same percentage of Jews as did the citizens of cities in Western European countries. Paulsson's research shows that {{at least as far as}} Warsaw is concerned, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poles</b> aiding Jews far outnumbered those who sold out their Jewish neighbors to the Nazis. During the Nazi occupation of Warsaw 70,000–90,000 Polish Gentiles aided Jews, while 3,000–4,000 were szmalcowniks, or blackmailers who collaborated with the Nazis in persecuting the Jews.|$|E
