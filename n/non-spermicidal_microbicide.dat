This study examined the potential utility of PHI- 443 as a <b>non-spermicidal</b> <b>microbicide</b> for prevention of sexual transmission of HIV. Our goal {{in this study was}} to test the effects of PHI- 443 on in vivo sperm functions under conditions shown to inactivate viruses in human cells. PHI- 443 completely prevented the vag-inal transmission of a genotypically and phenotypically drug-resistant HIV- 1 isolate in the humanized severe combined im-munodeficient (Hu-SCID) mouse model of sexually transmitted AIDS. Exposure of human sperm to PHI- 443 at doses 30 00...|$|E
