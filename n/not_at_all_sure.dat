25|$|Uranus is {{the third}} largest (Neptune has a larger mass, but a smaller volume) planet in the Solar System. It orbits the Sun at a {{distance}} of about 2.8billion kilometers (1.7billion miles), and it completes one orbit every 84 Earth years. The length of a day on Uranus as measured by Voyager 2 is 17 hours, 14 minutes. Uranus is unique among the planets in that its axial tilt is about 90°, meaning that its axis is roughly parallel with, not perpendicular to, the plane of the ecliptic. This extremely large tilt of its axis is thought {{to be the result of}} a collision between the accumulating planet Uranus with another planet-sized body early in the history of the Solar System. Given the unusual orientation of its axis, with the polar regions of Uranus exposed for periods of many years to either continuous sunlight or darkness, planetary scientists were <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> what to expect when observing Uranus.|$|E
500|$|Middle-class blacks {{throughout}} the United States [...] "were <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> {{how to behave}} or how whites would behave toward them", as Bart Landry puts it. In Cincinnati, the African-American newspaper editor Wendell Dabney wrote {{of the situation in}} the 1920s that [...] "hotels, restaurants, eating and drinking places, almost universally are closed to all people in whom the least tincture of colored blood can be detected." [...] Areas without significant black populations outside the South often refused to accommodate them: not one hotel or other accommodation was open to blacks in Salt Lake City, in the 1920s. Black travelers were stranded if they had to stop there overnight. Only six percent of the more than 100 motels that lined U.S. Route 66 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, admitted black customers. Across the whole state of New Hampshire, only three motels in 1956 served African Americans.|$|E
500|$|The {{critic for}} The Spectator felt that [...] "Ian Fleming {{has taken a}} hint from films of his books and is now {{inclined}} to send himself up. I am <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> that he is wise", while The Belfast Telegraph considered that Fleming was [...] "still {{in a class of}} his own." [...] The Bookman declared that You Only Live Twice [...] "must rank among the best of the Bonds". Malcolm Muggeridge, writing in Esquire magazine disagreed, writing that [...] "You Only Live Twice has a decidedly perfunctory air. Bond can only manage to sleep with his Japanese girl with the aid of colour pornography. His drinking sessions seem somehow desperate, and the horrors are too absurd to horrify... it's all rather a muddle and scarcely in the tradition of Secret Service fiction. Perhaps the earlier novels are better. If so, I shall never know, having no intention of reading them." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I know no {{more than}} you do, Geoffrey. I asked him where he was going, and he did <b>not</b> seem <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure.</b> He {{said that he would}} write if he {{remained}} away more than a day or two. You know how uncertain he is." ...|$|R
2500|$|Daniel Dennett {{says that}} prayer may relieve {{a person of}} the need to take active {{measures}} to address issues around them, [...] stating: Surely it does the world no harm if those who can honestly do so pray for me! No, I'm <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> about that. For one thing, if they really wanted to do something useful, they could devote their prayer time and energy to some pressing project that they can do something about.|$|E
2500|$|Cricket of {{the period}} did feature {{numerous}} great names such as Grace, Trumper, Blythe, Wilfred Rhodes, Jack Hobbs, C. B. Fry, Ranjitsinhji and Frank Woolley, but {{that in itself is}} not unique as any period in cricket history can boast its great players. As David Frith pointed out, the nostalgia [...] "needed someone to put a perspective on it". In his 1939 autobiography, Fry wrote: [...] "I have a notion that the cricket of the nineties and early nineteen hundreds was more amusing to watch, but I am <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> that the game of today is not more difficult to play".|$|E
2500|$|Sakharov {{never felt}} that by {{creating}} nuclear weapons he had [...] "known sin", in Oppenheimer's expression. He later wrote: [...] "After more than forty years, we have had no third world war, and the balance of nuclear terror... may have helped to prevent one. But I am <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> of this; back then, in those long-gone years, the question didn't even arise. What most troubles me now is the instability of the balance, the extreme peril of the current situation, the appalling waste of the arms race... Each of us {{has a responsibility to}} think about this in global terms, with tolerance, trust, and candor, free from ideological dogmatism, parochial interests, or national egotism." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> so <b>sure</b> of it. She {{may have}} told him when they first became acquainted, but I cannot imagine her telling him afterwards. He is as proud as she, and is just the man not to like it." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY UTTERWORD [vigorously]. Oh, let us prosecute him {{and have}} done with it. I have a {{conscience}} too, I hope; and I do <b>not</b> feel <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> that we have any right to let him go, especially if {{he is going to}} be greedy and impertinent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, Brooke," [...] one of {{the young}} lieutenants said, [...] "I did <b>not</b> feel <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> that Cooke was not humbugging us, when he {{introduced}} you to us, and that you were not really a Burman who had travelled, and had somehow learned to speak English extraordinarily well." ...|$|R
2500|$|After his retirement, Stanfield {{stayed out}} of {{politics}} until the constitutional debates, when he endorsed and campaigned for the Meech Lake Accord, the Charlottetown Accord, and free trade. He said that the Meech Lake Accord was {{a second chance to}} save Canada from disaster. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> that I would {{want to live in a}} country that rejected Meech Lake," [...] he said at the time. [...] "It wouldn't be the Canada I grew up in. It wouldn't be the country with the values that I've loved during my life." [...] Prime Minister Brian Mulroney wanted to appoint Stanfield as U.N. ambassador saying, [...] "I tried to engage him further but he was leading a vigorous life and a very active life and he didn't want to change after a while." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some BBC staff {{felt that}} too much blame had been placed on their {{organisation}} {{in the wake of}} the David Kelly affair in the Hutton Report, and that the government was interfering in the BBC. Tim Gospill, spokesman for the National Union of Journalists said [...] "Being independent doesn't just mean not having the government telling you what to do. It means you can criticise the government as well. I'm <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> the government understands that." [...] Groups of staff staged walk outs from Broadcasting House and other BBC offices in Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow, Cardiff and Londonderry, in protest at Dyke's resignation. In addition, on 31 January 2004, BBC staff paid for a full-page advert in the Daily Telegraph to express their [...] "dismay" [...] over Dyke's departure. The fundraisers hoped to raise £10,000, a lot less than the market rate for a full page advert in a broadsheet newspaper. Reportedly they raised less than this amount, but were offered a deal by the Telegraph's advertising department which allowed the advert to be printed. It was signed by around 4,000 BBC employees; 10,000 (around a third of total BBC staff at the time) submitted their names for publication, but there was not sufficient space to include them all.|$|E

60|$|The spears {{were pushed}} {{up and then}} worked a little to and fro to try to enlarge the hole. They were eight feet long, but Godfrey did <b>not</b> feel <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> that they {{penetrated}} through the cover of snow. However, when they had made a dozen of these holes there was a distinct change in the air.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> so <b>sure</b> of it. She {{has been}} made to believe that you wanted her to stay, and {{therefore}} she has stayed. She is quite master enough of herself to ride out hunting with him again and then to refuse him." [...] And so Lady Albury doubted up to the Sunday, and all through the Sunday,--up to the very moment when the last preparations were to be made for the man's arrival.|$|R
6000|$|... "Eva {{is a good}} girl,--a dear girl. But I am <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> so <b>sure</b> {{about that}} young fellow Abraham Grundle. It's a pity, President, your son had not been born a few years sooner." [...] At this moment my boy was half a head taller than young Grundle, and a much better {{specimen}} of a Britannulist. [...] "But {{it is too late}} now, I suppose, to talk of that. It seems to me that Jack never even thinks of looking at Eva." ...|$|R

60|$|But Corliss did {{go back to}} see her, {{and before}} the day was out. A little bitter self-communion had not taken long to show him his childishness. The sting of loss was hard enough, but the thought, now they could be nothing to each other, that her last {{impressions}} of him should be bad, hurt almost as much, and in a way, even more. And further, putting all to the side, he was really ashamed. He had thought {{that he could have}} taken such a disappointment more manfully, especially since in advance he had <b>not</b> been <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> of his footing.|$|R
60|$|My {{reasons for}} believing that Sylvia {{was on this}} island were circumstantial, it is true, but to me they were entirely conclusive, and the vehement desire of my soul was to hasten {{to the house and}} ask to see her. But I did <b>not</b> feel <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> that this would be the right thing to do. The {{circumstances}} of this case were unusual. Sylvia was a sister of a religious house. It was not customary for gentlemen to call upon such sisters, and the lady who was the temporary custodian of this one might resent such an attempt.|$|R
60|$|At Babington {{opinion was}} {{somewhat}} divided. Aunt Polly and Julia were of course certain that John Caldigate had married {{the woman in}} Australia. But the two other girls and their father were <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> so <b>sure.</b> Indeed, {{there had been a}} little misunderstanding among the Babingtons on the subject, which was perhaps strengthened by the fact that Mr. Smirkie had more endeared himself to Julia's mother than to Julia's father or sisters, and that Mr. Smirkie himself was very clear as to the criminality of the bigamist. 'I suppose you are often there,' Mr. Babington said to his guest, the parson of Utterden.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> that I shall {{like having}} you there," [...] she said. [...] "I shouldn't {{be at all}} {{surprised}} if it made me nervous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> {{that was}} an opportunity. It was only some of Tom's nonsense. I should have had all the {{politicians}} in the district against me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite an idea," [...] he remarked. [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> {{that our}} having become too civilised for crime {{is a healthy}} sign of the times." ...|$|E
6000|$|And in fact Alison did <b>not</b> feel <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> that, when {{stimulated by}} Bessie's {{appreciation}} of their mischief, her flock might {{not in her}} absence do something that might put their mother in despair, and make their character for naughtiness irretrievable; so Leoline and Hubert were summoned, the one from speculations whether Lord Keith would have punched his brother, the other from amaze that there was anything our military secretary could not do, and Conrade and Francis were arrested {{in the midst of}} a significant contraction of the nostrils and opening of the mouth, which would have exploded in an [...] "eehaw" [...] but for Bessie's valiant undertaking to be herself and Lady Temple both at once.|$|R
6000|$|Just at {{that most}} {{interesting}} moment they {{became aware of}} an arrival in the front drawing room, whither Aunt Plenty had discreetly retired. Rose felt grateful for the interruption, because, <b>not</b> being <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> {{of the state of}} her heart as yet, she was afraid of letting a sudden impulse lead her too far. But Charlie, conscious that a very propitious instant had been spoiled, regarded the newcomer with anything but a benignant expression of countenance and, whispering, [...] "Good-bye, my Rose, I shall look in this evening to see how you are after the fatigues of the day," [...] he went away, with such a cool nod to poor Fun See that the amiable Asiatic thought he must have mortally offended him.|$|R
60|$|Harry Oswald {{rose from}} his seat on the block of ice unwillingly, and {{proceeded}} on his road up the mountain with a distinct and decided feeling of nervousness. Was it the guide's story that made his knees tremble slightly? was it his own inexperience in climbing? {{or was it the}} cold and the fatigue of the first ascent of the season to a man not yet in full pedestrian Alpine training? He did <b>not</b> feel <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> about it in his own mind: but this much he knew with perfect certainty, that his footing was not nearly so secure under him as it had been during the earlier part of the climb over {{the lower end of the}} glacier.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> that I do, aunt," [...] said Gwendolen, with saucy gravity. [...] "I don't know {{everything}} it is proper to feel on being engaged." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Between you and me," [...] he confided, [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> that I am {{not here}} on a fool's errand--at least I thought so when I arrived." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After all, you know, you can't bluff him forever. You're sure to slip up {{sooner or}} later. And, anyway, I'm <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> that it isn't actionable--blackmail, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|Dorothy said 'Yes,' {{but she did}} <b>not</b> feel <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> about it. Captain Armstrong, {{who was in the}} Blues, {{had been}} among her most {{persistent}} admirers {{at the beginning of the}} season, and she had refused him a month before her engagement to Lord Halliburn. Doubtless, he also would have heard of her engagement being off, and might renew his attentions. He was a very popular man, and she was conscious that she liked him, and had said no, if <b>not</b> less decidedly, <b>at</b> least after more hesitation and doubt than she had done to any of her previous admirers. She felt sure that she should give the same answer if he ever repeated the question, but she did not want it repeated, and she wished that they had not met again, just at this time.|$|R
5000|$|On 6 June a {{fog bank}} {{was blown away}} and {{revealed}} the Dutch task force, sailing {{into the mouth of}} the Thames. On 7 June Cornelis de Witt revealed his secret instructions from the States General, written on 20 May, in the presence of all commanders. There were so many objections, while De Ruyter's only substantial contribution to the discussion was [...] "bevelen zijn bevelen [...] "("orders are orders"), that Cornelis, after retiring to his cabin late in the night, wrote in his daily report he did <b>not</b> feel <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> that he would be obeyed. The next day it transpired however that most officers were in for a bit of adventure; they had just given their professional opinion for the record so they could blame the politicians should the whole enterprise end in disaster. That day an attempt was made to capture a fleet of twenty English merchantmen seen higher up the Thames in the direction of London, but this failed as these fled to the west, beyond Gravesend.|$|R
60|$|With {{respect to}} the {{difference}} in the corolla of the central and exterior flowers of a head or umbel, I do <b>not</b> feel <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>sure</b> that C. C. Sprengel's idea that the ray-florets serve to attract insects, whose agency is highly advantageous in the fertilisation of plants of these two orders, is so far-fetched, as it may at first appear: and if it be advantageous, natural selection may have come into play. But in regard to the differences both in the internal and external structure of the seeds, which are not always correlated with any differences in the flowers, it seems impossible that they can be in any way advantageous to the plant: yet in the Umbelliferae these differences are of such apparent importance--the seeds being in some cases, according to Tausch, orthospermous in the exterior flowers and coelospermous in the central flowers,--that the elder De Candolle founded his main divisions of the order on analogous differences. Hence we see that modifications of structure, viewed by systematists as of high value, may be wholly due to unknown laws of correlated growth, and without being, {{as far as we can}} see, of the slightest service to the species.|$|R
