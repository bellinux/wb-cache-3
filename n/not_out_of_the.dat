5|$|The IOC has {{generally}} resisted awarding consecutive Olympic Games {{to the same}} continent. In recent history, however, the 2004 Summer Olympics and the 2006 Winter Olympics were both awarded to European nations, and President Jacques Rogge has said that back-to-back Olympics in the same continent were <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question for future games.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the veto}} {{question}} became central, the ministers were <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spotlight. Since the ministers were {{inferior to the}} King within the executive branch, the King was responsible for all actions conducted by this branch; however, the ministers {{were responsible for the}} advice given to the King when they were assembled in the Council of State. If any ministers were to dissent, according to the Constitution, they had to state this explicitly in the meeting protocol, lest they be considered in agreement and thus co-responsible. The King was above the law, but the Prime Minister and his cabinet could be tried for Impeachment for advising the King to act out an unconstitutional veto. The Impeachment Court consisted of Supreme Court Justices and elected politicians from the Lagting, and as the latter group held a two-thirds majority, an Impeachment trial with a fairly certain outcome could start as soon as the liberals won control over the Lagting seats through general elections.|$|E

5|$|Each title {{focuses on}} the {{extraordinary}} invading the ordinary world, though the two main Megami Tensei series focus on different things: Shin Megami Tensei focuses more on the main protagonist gaining the power needed {{to survive in a}} world ruled over by tyrannical deities, while Persona focuses on interpersonal relationships and the psychology of a group of people. That protagonist is generally male within the Shin Megami Tensei titles: while a female lead or the ability to choose a lead's gender is <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question, some staff feel that Shin Megami Tensei lead roles are better suited to a male character. Throughout its lifetime, the series has incorporated elements of Gnosticism, various world mythologies and religions including Christianity and Buddhism, early science fiction, Jungian psychology and archetypes, occultism, punk, and cyberpunk. The science fiction and fantasy elements are brought together and unified through the use of philosophical concepts, enabling a blending of concepts and aesthetics that might normally clash.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} scoring variations; under the first and simpler ruleset, {{the first player to}} pocket his private number wins. Under the second variation, {{although}} a player still wins by pocketing his private number, points are scored in various ways: 1) two points are given by each participant to the winning player for the pocketing of his private number; 2) a player receives one point for pocketing any other player's private number, and the player whose private number was pocketed is penalized one point (and can have a negative point total), but is <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game and can still win points in this way; 3) if a player whose private number is pocketed by another does not disclose this fact before a subsequent shot is taken, the non-disclosing player forfeits, immediately losing the game, and the player who made that ball is given two points instead of one. In the event that no player succeeds in pocketing his private number, gameplay ends when the last private number is potted, and the game is played again with all points values doubled.|$|E

25|$|In December 2008, three {{television}} stations which were owned by Belo Corporation {{prior to its}} acquisition by Gannett in 2014 (WFAA-TV, WCNC-TV, and KMOV-TV) reported that beginning January 1, 2009, Charter Communications would no longer carry these stations due to a breakdown in negotiations. Charter Communications quickly replied that a resolution to the issue was <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question. The cable operator would have lost access {{to all of the}} stations owned by Belo. However, an agreement was reached days before the shutdown date.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that this}} {{negative}} being {{the same number}} is detected as an overflow condition since there was a carry into but <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most-significant bit. This can lead to unexpected bugs in that an unchecked implementation of absolute value could return a negative number {{in the case of}} the minimum negative. The abs family of integer functions in C typically has this behaviour. This is also true for Java. In this case it is for the developer to decide if there will be a check for the minimum negative value before the call of the function.|$|E
25|$|In March 2004, {{the labor}} union {{representing}} Metro Transit bus workers went on strike. This delayed {{the opening of}} the line from the anticipated start date of April 3, although there was some indication that the opening would have been delayed anyway. Apparently, some of the delay had to do with slow delivery of trainsets from Bombardier. Certain aspects of the design had been tried before, but the cars were the first to combine the factors of conforming to American standards (as opposed to European), having low floors and being built at the company's Mexico plant. Some problems also cropped up during testing of the vehicles, but Bombardier said that the issues were <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary.|$|E

25|$|Australia then swept New Zealand 3â€“0 in the ODIs in New Zealand. In {{the first}} match, Nitschke took 1/12 from six overs and made 51 as Australia {{were able to}} scrape home by two wickets. The series then ended with matches on {{consecutive}} days in Invercargill. Nitschke was attacked on the first day, conceding 18 runs from three overs without taking a wicket, before opening the batting and scoring 113 <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tourists' 4/256 in a six-wicket win, registering her maiden ODI century. She made six and was wicketless in a six-wicket win in the final match. Nitschke ended the series with 170 runs at 85.00 and took 1/45 from 13 overs.|$|E
25|$|With the bat he was {{especially}} effective against spin bowlers. However, he liked to slog and was criticised for his lack of high scores and giving away his wicket too cheaply. In October 1996 he scored 257 runs <b>not</b> <b>out,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team's total of 553 against lowly Zimbabwe on a typical flat South Asian pitch at Sheikhupura. He also achieved good scores for the Pakistan team such as his scores of 123 and 45* against Australia to take Pakistan to victory in a low scoring match. His batting was also valuable sometimes to the Pakistan ODI side, {{such as in the}} Nehru Cup in 1989, when needing six runs and two balls to win the match, he hit the first delivery he faced, from part-time off-spinner and batting legend, Viv Richards, for a six and secured the cup.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} managed colonies in the United States for honey {{production}} {{has been in}} decline since the 1940s. Annual declines and colony losses are normal however the rate of honeybee deaths {{as well as the}} inability to find a determinate cause of the deaths has caused some alarm. In 2006, some beekeepers reported losing 30-90% of their hives. Total colony loss reached 45% between 2012 and 2013, up from 28.9% and 36.4% in previous years. While annual losses above 30% are <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary, the symptoms of these colony losses do not all match with those normally produced by known pests and pathogens. The amount of loss experienced as well as uncertainty around the cause of the loss lead to the coining of the term Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) by the apiculture community.|$|E

25|$|Kewell {{was injured}} {{for the start}} of the 2007â€“08 season, and he faced an {{uncertain}} future at Liverpool having suffered yet another injury, which sidelined him for the first month of the Premier League season. Kewell returned as a substitute in Liverpool's League Cup victory over Cardiff City on 31 October, coming on in the 71st minute. He then came on as a substitute in the Premier League and Champions League against Blackburn and BeÅŸiktaÅŸ respectively. Kewell put in a great performance by setting up two goals for Fernando Torres and Dirk Kuyt as Liverpool beat Marseille in impressive fashion 4â€“0 away victory to secure qualification to the knockout phase of the Champions League. After his return, Liverpool manager Rafael BenÃ­tez stated on the club's website and to other members of the media that a new contract for Kewell to continue his career at Anfield was <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question. Many believed that if Kewell could stay injury free until the season's end he would be offered the chance to remain with the club.|$|E

500|$|After the {{evacuation}} of Dunkirk, people believed that the threatened invasion could come at almost any time. Churchill was at times personally pessimistic about Britain's chances for victory, telling Hastings Ismay on 12 June 1940 that [...] "ou and I will be dead in three months' time". German preparations would require {{at least a few}} weeks, but all defensive precautions were made with an extreme sense of urgency. In mid-1940, an invasion attempt could have occurred at any time, but some times were more likely than others: the phase of the moon, the tides and, most of all, the weather were considerations. The weather usually deteriorates significantly after September, but an October landing was <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question. On 3 October, General Brooke wrote in his diary: [...] "Still no invasion! I am beginning to think that the Germans may after all not attempt it. And yet!
