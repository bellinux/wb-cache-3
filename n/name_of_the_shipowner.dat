30|$|Although bunker {{cost savings}} {{is a major}} {{incentive}} for slow-steaming, <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuel price level alone is not as salient as one might suspect because fuel surcharges, or bunker adjustment factor (BAF), distort the economic signal that the fuel price provides to shipowners in regard to sailing speed (ibid).

40|$|Historically, {{there is}} a long {{tradition}} of granting vessels in distress a place of refuge, particularly for humanitar-ian reasons, but more recently there has been a growing apprehension of coastal states to grant refuge.
