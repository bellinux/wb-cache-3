His hair was blue and his clothes scarlet, and Dorothy noticed that every button on his jacket was the head of some animal. The top button was a bear's head and the <b>next</b> <b>button</b> a wolf's head; the next was a cat's head and the next a weasel's head, while the last button of all was the head of a field-mouse.

50|$|Three-row concertinas add a {{third row}} of accidentals (i.e., sharps and flats not {{included}} in the keys represented by the two main rows) and redundant notes (i.e., notes that duplicate those in the main keys but are located in the third, outermost row) that enable the instrument to be played in virtually any key. A series of sequential notes can be played in the home-key rows by depressing a button, compressing the bellows, depressing the same button and extending the bellows, moving to the <b>next</b> <b>button</b> and repeating the process, and so on. A consequence of this arrangement is that the player often encounters occasions requiring a change in bellows direction, which produces a clear separation between the sounds of the two adjacent notes. This tends to give the music a more punctuated, bouncy sound that can be especially well suited to hornpipes or jigs.|$|E

5000|$|The basic combat {{clothing}} was a flocked cotton over nylon. There {{are many different}} variations on the Canadian combat shirt (tunic); one was a simple button up with FN magazine type pockets, another made of a heavier material (for cold weather) and had a zipper in place of buttons with the same pocket style but without dividers for FNC1A1 magazines, and the cadet combats that was made of a lighter material then to both and had different pockets arrangement and size as well as no draw strings. The combat jacket was of heavy cotton while the arctic jacket had a nylon shell. Both the combat shirt and the jackets had two lower cargo pockets with inserts that could hold 3 FNC1A1 20 round magazines each. The upper 2 pockets were angled inward and could hold 1 FNC1A1 magazine each. The combat shirts also have one inner pocket that was held closed by velcro and was clearly visible by an outline of thread on the outer {{right side of the}} shirt. Both the jackets and combat shirts have draw strings on the bottom {{and in the middle of}} the shirt, these were there to prevent debris and winds from entering the shirt as well as to prevent billowing during para jumping. Combat pants have buttons on every belt loop, this was if the pants were to large you could button over to the <b>next</b> <b>button</b> to make them smaller. Combat pants also had [...] "blousers" [...] which were tucked into the boots and the draw string on the bottom of the pant leg with be tightened around the top of the boot to keep out foreign objects and pests.

5000|$|There {{are a few}} running gags in the show. The main one is the [...] "Upside-Down" [...] button. When this button {{is pressed}} (and it is in every episode but one), the {{viewpoint}} shifts, with a silly sound effect, to an upside-down shot of whomever is in the scene. The actors' and puppets' hands are held {{up in the air}} to make it look as if they are hanging upside down. One of the boys begs the viewer to press the [...] "Right Side Up" [...] button, at which point the viewpoint rights itself. Another sequence seen in each episode is the use of the [...] "Instant Replay" [...] button. The brothers ask the viewer to press this button to see a child do something again. During the slow motion replay, Shane and David play the role of commentators, narrating the action and assessing the child's technique. A more subtle running gag is the fake pineapple that appears in at least three episodes. Another is the [...] "Mute button". Once this button is pressed, Shane speaks without a sound until David presses [...] "Unmute", which reverses the effects of the [...] "Mute button" [...] and is only seen in the episode [...] "Airport". Next is the [...] "Rotate" [...] button in the episode [...] "Pet Shop". When David or the viewers press this special button, the viewpoint shifts 360 degress. The <b>next</b> <b>button</b> is the [...] "Horizontal button", in which whomever is at the scene is put in the sideways position and one of the boys ask the viewer to press the [...] "Vertical button", which puts the actors in the upright position and is only seen in the episode [...] "Camping". This next one is the [...] "Up button", which makes the actors go up and they beg for the viewers to press the [...] "Down button" [...] to put them down and is only seen in the episode [...] "Barbershop". Next is the [...] "Stumble button" [...] from the 1st episode [...] "Movie Theater". If David or the viewers press this ridiculus button, they look like they stumbled and tripped. Up next is the [...] "Inside button". If the viewers press this hilarious button, the boys will disappear and then reappear inside a cup and Puppet and the boy's picnic supplies inside the basket. At that moment, the boys beg for the viewers to press the [...] "Outside button" [...] for the boys {{to get out of the}} cup and their picnic basket. Next up, the [...] "Sandwich button". In the episode [...] "Picnic", when Shane and David are in the [...] "Sandwich Room", Shane asks the viewers to press the [...] "Sandwich Button" [...] and once that happens, sandwiches appear.

This application provides a graphical user interface with words as questions and balloons as the options. The end user will have to select a balloon in order to select an answer. There are three modules in this application which are game mode, new game and high scores. In the basic module questions like Alpha_bet are included. Also as an enhancement, the game is made interesting by giving the user three lives to clear the levels of the game. Three small balloons {{are included in the}} application which resemble the three lives and once an incorrect answer is selected, the green balloon will be replaced by a red balloon depicting an incorrect answer. Also the scores will be computed for every correct option that is selected by the user. The score is incremented by ten points for every correct answer. And for the high score section, the game would maintain the list of top players. High score section will consist of the user’s name, score, time and date for the gameplay. Apart from that a <b>next</b> <b>button</b> is included which helps the user to skip a word which the user finds it difficult to answer.

40|$|Via the use {{of mobile}} phones, the Short Message Service (SMS) is {{the one of the}} most {{important}} mobile applications for communication between two or more people. Moreover, the effectiveness on typing messages needed to be improved in the area of the typing performance. When the typing performance is low, people might get frustrated. There are several text input methods in mobile phones. The study is conducted based on three text input methods such as T 9 method. Multi-press with <b>next</b> <b>button</b> and Multipress with timeout method. However, there are problems caused by these three methods towards mobile phone application. There are numerous errors when typing messages using text input methods. Moreover, some text input methods are just too expensive and these methods take so much space in mobile phones' memory. Therefore, a lot of investigations or research must be done to determine which text input method that is able to gain more interest among stakeholders. Moreover, the new prototype recommended will be able to overcome the problems caused by existing text input methods. The purpose of the study for this research is to experiment the typical text input methods which are commonly used in mobile phones and also to determine the problems of typing messages which occur in many mobile applications. From this research, it is hoped that the new prototype which has been proposed can overcome the problems of typing messages. The methodologies used in this research are distributing questiormaires to one hundred and fifty one (151) students of the Faculty of Information Technology and Quantative, UiTM Shah Alam, as mobile application users. Moreover, this research has conducted an experiment involving six (6) of students as the test subjects. Based on the methodologies, the comparative results of the three text input methods are validated systematically. But more researches should be conducted in order to gain better information and find solutions to improve the functions of text input methods. Last but not least, it is also hoped that the users will enjoy better mobile application that they use in their daily lives...|$|E
