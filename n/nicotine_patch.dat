40|$|PURPOSE: In studies where [(11) C]raclopride (RAC) {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET) is used to assess changes in striatal dopamine, {{it is important to}} control for cognitive states, such as drug craving, that could alter dopamine levels. In cigarette smokers, transdermal <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches</b> (TNP) can control nicotine craving, but the effects of <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches</b> on RAC binding are unknown. Thus, we sought to determine the test-retest reliability of RAC binding in the presence of <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches.</b> METHODS: Eleven male smokers were scanned twice with RAC on separate days while wearing TNP. RESULTS: Across the striatum, test-retest variability was 7. 63 ± 5. 88; percent change in binding potential was 1. 11 ± 9. 83; and the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0. 91 (p < 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Baseline RAC binding is highly reproducible in smokers wearing <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches.</b> This suggests that TNP are an acceptable method for controlling cigarette craving during studies that utilize RAC to examine changes in dopamine...|$|R

25|$|Although {{nicotine}} does {{play a role}} {{in acute}} episodes of some diseases (including stroke, impotence, and heart disease) by its stimulation of adrenaline release, which raises blood pressure, heart and respiration rate, and free fatty acids, the most serious longer term effects are more the result of the products of the smouldering combustion process. This has {{led to the development of}} various nicotine delivery systems, such as the <b>nicotine</b> <b>patch</b> or nicotine gum, that can satisfy the addictive craving by delivering nicotine without the harmful combustion by-products. This can help the heavily dependent smoker to quit gradually, while discontinuing further damage to health.|$|E

(Arrow 1963, p. 954) Health care is heavily subsidised in most Western societies. Even in the US, that is sometimes characterised as a private insurance market, government spending accounts for almost 50 % of total health care expenditure (Folland et al., 2001). 1 Explaining the heavy subsidisation of health care has been difficult for economists.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESTo {{determine}} if <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches,</b> both as prescribed and used over-the-counter, {{increase the risk}} of first myocardial infarction (MI). BACKGROUNDAlthough <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches</b> improve smoking cessation rates, case reports have raised the hypothesis that they may {{increase the risk of}} MI. METHODSA population-based case-control study among 68 hospitals in an eight-county region surrounding Philadelphia was performed to {{determine if}} <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches</b> increase the risk of first MI. Cases were smokers (current or within the prior year) admitted to all hospitals in the region with a first MI. Controls were smokers (current or within the prior year) without prior MI selected from the same region using random-digit dialing. Data were collected by telephone interviews and chart reviews. The study had 80 % power to detect an odds ratio (OR) of 2. 5. RESULTSA total of 653 cases and 2, 990 controls were interviewed. There was no association between <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches</b> and MI (OR 0. 46; 95 % CI: 0. 09, 1. 47), and the confidence interval (CI) excluded an effect from <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches</b> equal to that from cigarette smoking itself (OR < 2. 5). Among those who abstained from smoking, the OR for use of <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches</b> was 0. 25 (95 % CI: 0. 01, 1. 67); among those who smoked concomitantly, the OR for patch use was 0. 83 (95 % CI: 0. 09, 3. 81). Adjustment for confounding did not alter the study’s findings (OR adjusted for confounders that could mask a harmful effect of patches: 0. 70; 95 % CI: 0. 20, 2. 46). CONCLUSIONSNicotine patches, as used in actual practice, {{do not appear to be}} associated with an increased risk of MI...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND—The first {{nicotine}} replacement product, Nicorette Gum, was marketed in 1984  as an adjuvant to help smokers quit smoking. In 1992, sales of <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches</b> were begun. Before 1996, nicotine gums and <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches</b> were {{prescribed by}} physicians and supplemented with behavioural counselling. Since 1996, nicotine gums and patches became available over the counter.  OBJECTIVES—To examine {{the effect of}} sales of nicotine replacement products on national cigarette consumption.  DESIGN—National time series quarterly cigarette consumption, sales of <b>nicotine</b> gums and <b>patches</b> data between 1976  and 1998  are used to estimate a time series autoregressive moving average intervention model.  PARTICIPANTS—National reported statistics.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Per capita cigarette sales.  RESULTS—A 10 % increase in sales of nicotine replacement products will lead to a 0. 04 % reduction in cigarette sales. The model indicates that a 0. 076 % reduction in cigarette consumption is associated with the availability of <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches</b> after 1992.  The over the counter dummy variable (after 1996) has a negative sign, but is not significant, perhaps due to only a few quarters of data in the study period.  CONCLUSIONS—Nicotine replacement products (nicotine gums and <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches)</b> {{play a significant role in}} reducing cigarette consumption, in addition to the negative effect of increasing cigarette price and the overall trend of declining cigarette consumption (as reflected by the time trend variable). The findings of this study suggest that additional efforts for promoting sales of nicotine replacement products will be another effective alternative to discouraging cigarette consumption.    Keywords: nicotine replacement products; nicotine gum; nicotine patches; cigarette consumptio...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and {{validate}} a method for evaluating the release and skin permeation from transdermal <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches</b> using the vertical diffusion cell (VDC). The VDC is an experimental apparatus employed in research, development, and the pharmaceutical field because it can simulate conditions closest to those established in clinical trials. Two transdermal nicotine delivery systems marketed in Brazil to release 14 mg over 24 hours were evaluated. Release studies were carried out using a regenerated cellulose dialysis membrane and permeation studies were carried out using excised porcine ear skin. The results indicated that nicotine release from both evaluated patches follows Higuchi's release kinetics, while skin permeation studies indicated zero-order release kinetics. Nicotine release rates were different between both evaluated patches, but drug permeation rates were not significantly different. According to validation studies, the method was appropriate for evaluating in vitro performance of <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches.</b> The proposed method can be applied to in vitro comparative studies between different commercial <b>nicotine</b> <b>patches</b> and may be used as an auxiliary tool in the design of new transdermal nicotine delivery systems...|$|R
