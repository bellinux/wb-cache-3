25|$|Growth in the {{secondary}} market continued trending upward in 2014 reaching its highest level yet, with an estimated total transaction volume of $49.3bn per the Setter Capital Volume Report 2014, as follows: private equity $37.9 billion, real estate secondaries $6.8 billion, hedge fund side pockets $2.5 billion, infrastructure funding $1.9 billion and timber fund deals at $0.2 billion. According to Setter Capital Inc, there were a total of 1270 transactions in 2014, with an average size of approximately $37.7 million. Although the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> was roughly {{the same as in}} 2013, the average deal size increased 34.6% year over year, reflecting the fact that more multi-hundred million / billion+ dollar transactions were completed in 2014. Indeed, the breadth and number of buyers continues to increase with total volume and activity of small and medium buyers becoming more significant. Large buyers accounted for 59.8% of the market’s total volume in 2014, while mid-sized buyers accounted for roughly 34.9% of total volume and small buyers represented roughly 5.3%. Also driving the expansion of {{the secondary}} market is the number of buyers expanding their scope of interest into areas in which they were previously inactive. Approximately 31.4% of buyers broadened their secondary focus in 2014 to include buying other alternative investment types (e.g. infrastructure, real estate, portfolios of direct, etc.) – an increase of 1.4% from 2013.|$|E

Two agents, Teni Yerima and Peter Harrison, were {{secretly}} filmed, each separately claiming that they had paid Allardyce through his son. Allardyce denied ever taking, or asking for, a bribe. Others implicated of wrongdoing were Harry Redknapp, Kevin Bond, and Frank Arnesen. As a result of the allegation, Allardyce refused to speak to the BBC. While he also stated he was going to sue the broadcaster to clear his name, Allardyce failed to issue libel proceedings as he was advised that suing for damage to reputation was a costly and time-consuming process. The final report of the Stevens inquiry published in June 2007 expressed concerns regarding the involvement of Craig Allardyce in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions,</b> stating that: [...] "The inquiry remains concerned at the conflict of interest that it believes existed between Craig Allardyce, his father Sam Allardyce—the then manager at Bolton—and the club itself."

500|$|James the Fat led {{the men of}} Lennox and Argyll in open {{rebellion}} against the crown and {{this may have been}} what the king needed to bring a charge of treason against the Albany Stewarts. Murdoch, his sons Walter and Alexander and Duncan, Earl of Lennox were in Stirling Castle for their trial on 18 May at a specially convened parliament. An assize of seven earls and fourteen lesser nobles were appointed to hear the evidence that linked the prisoners to the rebellion in the Lennox. [...] The four men were condemned, Walter on 24 May and the others on 25 May and immediately beheaded in 'front of the castle'. James demonstrated a ruthless and avaricious side to his nature in the destruction of his close family, the Albany Stewarts, that yielded the three forfeited earldoms of Fife, Menteith and Lennox. An enquiry set up by James in 1424 into the dispersal of crown estates since the reign of Robert I exposed legal defects in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> where the earldoms of Mar, March and Strathearn together with the Black Douglas lordships of Selkirk and Wigtown were found to be problematic. [...] Strathearn and March were forfeited in 1427 and 1435 respectively. Mar was forfeited in 1435 on the earl's death without heir which also meant that the lordships of Garioch and Badenoch reverted to the crown. James sought to boost his income further through taxation and succeeded in getting parliament to pass legislation in 1424 for a tax to go towards paying off the ransom—£26,000 was raised but James sent only £12,000 to England. By 1429, James stopped the ransom payments completely and used the remainder of the taxation on buying cannons and luxury goods from Flanders. Following a fire in the castle of Linlithgow in 1425, funds were also diverted to the building of Linlithgow Palace which continued until James's death in 1437 and absorbed an estimated one tenth of royal income.|$|E

2500|$|Riba an-jahiliya: usury {{practiced in}} pre-Islamic Arabia {{referred}} to in [...] Scholars differ on its definition. According to Raqiub Zaman and M.O.Farooq, a riba an-jahiliya debt was [...] "doubled and redoubled" [...] each year if the borrower could not pay what was owed. Another definition followed by some misguided people (according to Taqi Usmani), is that riba an-jahiliya {{was a kind of}} loan where the agreement did not call payment above the principal by the lender, but if they could not pay back when the debt was due they were given more time if they paid an additional amount (not necessarily double or triple the principal). [...] Usmani states that in reality [...] a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> where [...] "an increased amount was charged on the principal amount of a debt" [...] were in vogue at that time and can be considered riba an-jahiliya. Other orthodox scholars agree and state riba an-jahiliya, riba an-nasiya, riba al-duyun, riba al-Quran, [...] riba al-qardh are all names for one of two types of riba, the other type being riba al-fadl.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addressing}} {{the equal protection}} challenge, the Court used the rational basis standard, declining to hold that homosexuals are a suspect class. It noted that [...] "ational-basis review, a paradigm of judicial restraint, {{does not provide a}} license for courts to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of legislative choices." [...] The defendants-appellees had argued that the law [...] "is rationally related to Florida's interest in furthering the best interests of adopted children by placing them in families with married mothers and fathers" [...] and that [...] "disallowing adoption into homosexual households, which are necessarily motherless or fatherless and lack the stability that comes with marriage, is a rational means of furthering Florida's interest in promoting adoption by marital families." [...] Plaintiffs-appellants had argued that [...] "the statute is not rationally related to this interest", being [...] "overinclusive and underinclusive." [...] The Court rejected appellants' arguments, holding that [...] "The Florida legislature could rationally conclude that homosexuals and heterosexual singles are not [...] "similarly situated in relevant respects." [...] It is not irrational to think that heterosexual singles have a markedly greater probability of eventually establishing a married household and, thus, providing their adopted children with a stable, dual-gender parenting environment. Moreover, as the state noted, the legislature could rationally act on the theory that heterosexual singles, even if they never marry, are better positioned than homosexual individuals to provide adopted children with education and guidance relative to their sexual development throughout pubescence and adolescence." [...] The Court rejected a comparison with Romer v. Evans noting that [...] "Florida's statute is not so [...] "weeping and comprehensive" [...] as to render Florida's rationales for the statute [...] "inexplicable by anything but animus" [...] toward its homosexual residents. Amendment 2 deprived homosexual persons of [...] "protections against exclusion from an almost limitless <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> and endeavors that constitute ordinary civic life in a free society." [...] In contrast to this [...] "broad and undifferentiated disability," [...] the Florida classification is limited to the narrow and discrete context of access to the statutory privilege of adoption27 and, more importantly, has a plausible connection with the state's asserted interest. Moreover, not only is the effect of Florida's classification dramatically smaller, but the classification itself is narrower. Whereas Amendment 2's classification encompassed both conduct and status, Florida's adoption prohibition is limited to conduct. Thus, we conclude that Romer's unique factual situation and narrow holding are inapposite to this case." [...] thus, the Court rejected the equal protection claim.|$|E
