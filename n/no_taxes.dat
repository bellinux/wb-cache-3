5|$|The United Fruit Company {{had been}} formed in 1899 by {{the merger of}} two large American corporations. The new company had major {{holdings}} of land and railroads across Central America, which it used to support its business of exporting bananas. In 1900 it was already the world's largest exporter of bananas. By 1930 it had an operating capital of 215 million US dollars, and had been the largest landowner and employer in Guatemala for several years. Under Manuel Estrada Cabrera and other Guatemalan presidents, the company obtained a series of concessions {{in the country that}} allowed it to massively expand its business. These concessions frequently came at the cost of tax revenue for the Guatemalan government. The company supported Jorge Ubico in the leadership struggle that occurred from 1930 to 1932, and upon assuming power, Ubico expressed willingness to create a new contract with it. This new contract was immensely favorable to the company. It included a 99-year lease to massive tracts of land, exemptions from virtually all taxes, and a guarantee that no other company would receive any competing contract. Under Ubico, the company paid virtually <b>no</b> <b>taxes,</b> which hurt the Guatemalan government's ability to deal with the effects of the Great Depression. Ubico asked the company to pay its workers only 50 cents a day, to prevent other workers from demanding higher wages. The company also virtually owned Puerto Barrios, Guatemala's only port to the Atlantic ocean, allowing the company to make profits from the flow of goods through the port. By 1950, the company's annual profits were 65 million US dollars, twice the revenue of the Guatemalan government.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the region fell to the Ottoman Turks shortly after 1369 and the coastal towns were conquered in 1453. Under Ottoman rule, many villages provided auxiliaries to the Ottoman army or had to protect the mountain passes and therefore enjoyed a more favourable status— they paid <b>no</b> <b>taxes</b> and the men {{had the right to}} bear arms. There were 17 privileged villages in the territory of the modern park where Muslims were not allowed to settle. During the time of internal disorder in the Ottoman Empire in 1785–1810, brigand bands wreaked havoc in Strandzha resulting in the migration of thousands of people. Another massive migration wave followed the Russo-Turkish War (1828–29) and many Bulgarians settled in the southern areas of the Russian Empire. After the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, Strandzha remained outside the borders of the reborn state. In July 1903 in the historic area Petrova Niva the delegates of the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) discussed the outbreak of an anti-Ottoman rebellion. The Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising broke out in Strandzha and Macedonia in August 1903 and lasted for about twenty days before being suppressed by the Turks who committed great atrocities to the local population. Over 60 villages were burned down and thousands were massacred. Strandzha was liberated during the First Balkan War (1912–1913) and formally joined Bulgaria after the Second Balkan War in 1913.|$|E

The United Arab Emirates has been successfully diversifying the economy. 71% of UAE's total GDP comes from non-oil sectors. Oil accounts for only 2% of Dubai's GDP.

The Sheekmans {{were on their way}} to Italy. At the time, American artists living abroad for at least eighteen months paid <b>no</b> <b>taxes</b> on income earned during the residency. Sheekman was now very successful. In the eight years since returning from New York, he had been on fourteen movies, mostly writing the screenplays. He wanted to try another play. For the next eighteen months, Stuart painted and Sheekman worked on his play.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} {{battle for}} control of the Hudson County Democratic machine would ironically result in one of the greatest boosts to Hague's rise to power - the Walsh Act of 1911. In 1909 Davis, seeing support for Hague increasing, supported Wittpenn's re-election against former mayor Fagan. Hague's second ward produced the largest plurality of Wittpenn votes of any of Jersey City's 12 wards. Davis then arranged the appointment of Fagan to the Hudson County Tax Board. When Wittpenn's administration began facing troubles, including Fagan's discovery of a Pennsylvania Railroad property that had paid <b>no</b> <b>taxes</b> for four years, Wittpenn blamed Davis.|$|E

25|$|The Commissioners met for {{the first}} time on 6 June 1760, and planned the {{take-over}} of all of the drainage mills in the region, the construction of new ones, and the digging of the main drainage channels which would feed surface water to the mills and into the rivers. To finance these operations, there were empowered to borrow money, and to charge a drainage rate of 1 shilling (5p) per acre, rising to 1/6d (7.5p) after seven years. The costs of carrying out such work were grossly optimistic, and the commissioners were soon in financial difficulties. Despite this, and heavy flooding in the winter of 1761/2, which resulted in <b>no</b> <b>taxes</b> being collected, the Commissioners owned eight mills by 1774, each of which used a scoop wheel to lift water into the rivers. The costs of maintenance and repair of the mills were high, not helped by the Naval shipbuilding programme driving up the cost of oak.|$|E
500|$|The {{benefit to}} the forty-niners was that the gold was simply [...] "free for the taking" [...] at first. In the goldfields at the beginning, there was no private property, no {{licensing}} fees, and <b>no</b> <b>taxes.</b> The miners informally adapted Mexican mining law that had existed in California. For example, the rules attempted to balance the rights of early arrivers at a site with later arrivers; a [...] "claim" [...] could be [...] "staked" [...] by a prospector, but that claim was valid {{only as long as}} it was being actively worked.|$|E
500|$|In 1665, the Concession and Agreement {{was written}} {{in an effort to}} entice {{settlers}} to New Jersey. This document provided for religious freedom, <b>no</b> <b>taxes</b> without assembly approval, and a governor appointed by the proprietors. The first governor appointed in this way was Philip Carteret, who founded Elizabethtown. Colonists were required to pay annual quit-rent taxes. On March 18, 1674, after encountering difficulty collecting the taxes, Lord Berkeley sold his share in the colony to Edward Byllynge, a Quaker businessman from London. This sale divided New Jersey into East Jersey and West Jersey; however, the border between the two was not agreed upon until the Quintipartite Deed in 1676. [...] From 1701 to 1765, colonists skirmished in the New York-New Jersey Line War over disputed colonial boundaries.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, on {{the evening}} of 19 February 1802, a mob {{assembled}} and raided the castle of La Sarraz, seizing and burning the archives listing the taxes due for the surrounding area, on the understanding that <b>no</b> <b>taxes</b> could be levied without the documents establishing what was due and by whom. The sub-prefect of Cossonay noted that the raid had been conducted by a large number of people, and that they had taken the time to sort through the archives, taking all deeds and administrative papers of value but leaving all family records in place.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to simply arguing for their rights as Englishmen, the congress also asserted {{that they had}} certain natural rights solely because they were human beings.

2500|$|A basic {{issue in}} {{determining}} whether Internet access and Internet usage of various kinds is subject to sales tax, use tax, telecommunications tax, {{a combination of these}} taxes, or <b>no</b> <b>taxes</b> at all, is whether Internet access and usage is determined to be a [...] "good" [...] or a [...] "service." [...] If access to the Internet or usage is deemed a service, in general no sales or use taxation applies, while the rates and variants of telecommunications taxes that apply can be different. However, if access requires downloading of user software, some U.S. states (e.g., Massachusetts) may deem that to be a [...] "taxable sale" [...] of goods for their residents.|$|E
2500|$|In 1765 Otis Jr. {{attended}} the Continental Congress, {{otherwise known as}} the Stamp Act Congress, along with other colonial delegates.
