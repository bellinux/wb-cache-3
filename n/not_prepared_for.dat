5|$|In 1572, Sigismund II Augustus, {{the last}} {{king of the}} Jagiellonian dynasty, died without any heirs. The {{political}} system was <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> this eventuality, as there was no method of choosing a new king. After much debate {{it was determined that}} the entire nobility of Poland and Lithuania would decide who the king was to be. The nobility were to gather at Wola, near Warsaw, to vote in the royal election.|$|E
5|$|O'Regan {{said that}} Australian players were <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> playing cricket in Asia, {{as they were}} not aware of the dangers of bookmakers and betting on the Indian subcontinent. He {{recommended}} that every new player should be warned of the dangers of becoming involved with bookmakers, and the penalties that it entails. The ICC announced that no further action would be taken against Waugh and Warne as they could not be tried twice for the same offence.|$|E

50|$|French forces massed on {{the west}} bank of the River Var, giving warning of {{preparations}} for an invasion. However, the Savoy stronghold at Nice did <b>not</b> <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> a siege - at the end of the year, its powder reserves were sent to the Piedmont.|$|R
5|$|The French 55th Infantry Division was <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> such an attack. French {{soldiers}} had {{commented on the}} massive psychological effect of the bombardment, in particular the siren of the Ju 87. However, after the war, {{it was discovered that}} none of the bunkers had been destroyed by direct hits. Moreover, just 56 French casualties were suffered. It was the indirect effect that did the damage. The telecommunication cables were destroyed (most had been laid out in the open) through bombing, paralysing the division's communications, and the psychological damage crippled its defensive capacity.|$|E
5|$|American {{forces were}} quick to counter the attack. M20 {{recoilless}} rifles destroyed the machine gun positions, and American mortars began firing on any North Korean positions they could locate. However, North Korean forces {{were quick to}} advance up the Notch, to {{the crest of the}} hill that made up the pass. There, the discovered B Company, 19th Infantry, encamped. The 19th Infantry was apparently <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> combat, as North Korean forces were able to hit the American force and drive it off the hill, killing several of the American soldiers with bayonets. At about 12:00, B Company was driven from the crest of the Notch, and further confusion erupted when US Air Force aircraft accidentally strafed the retreating B Company. Neighboring positions also mistakenly attacked B Company, which retreated with 12 killed.|$|E
5|$|JG 27 {{was moved}} out of Africa {{for about a month}} because of the impact Marseille's death had on morale. The deaths of two other German aces, Günter Steinhausen and Marseille's friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt, just three weeks earlier reduced spirits to an all-time low. One biographer {{suggests}} these consequences were instigated by a failure in the command style of Marseille, although it was not entirely within his control. The more success Marseille had, the more his staffel relied on him to carry the greater share of aerial victories claimed by the unit. So his death, when it came, was something which JG 27 had seemingly <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for.</b>|$|E
25|$|The drop {{in prices}} {{presented}} {{a serious problem}} for oil-exporting countries in northern Europe and the Persian Gulf.

50|$|Beyond avoidance, many {{students}} {{do not understand the}} high-stakes nature of placement testing. Lack of preparation is also cited as a problem.

5|$|Maha Chakkraphat, {{being unable}} to repel the Burmese, {{sent a message to}} his {{son-in-law}} Maha Thammaracha at Phitsanulok, ordering his vassal to come to his aid by bringing an army southwards towards Ayutthaya and if possible to engage the enemy in battle. Thammaracha quickly mobilized his forces {{and with the help of}} the Governor of Sawankhalok, marched southward with a large army to attack the Burmese rear. Upon hearing of this and on the advice of Bayinnaung; Tabinshwehti decided to withdraw, abandoning the mission altogether. His decision was compounded by news from Burma that the Mons, who had never been entirely subjugated by the Taungoo dynasty, rebelled in the absence of the king. Other factors included the scarcity of supplies and sickness in his army, which was <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> a long siege.|$|E

During the service, CeCe's dress is ruined when Jim changes her diaper. Jim scrambles to replace the gown, and CeCe is eventually baptized in an Arcade Fire T-shirt he found in the back of his car. At the end of the mass, the minister announces there will be a reception hosted by Jim and Pam, who panic because the reception was for family only and they are <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> so many guests.|$|E
5|$|The 1976 World Ice Hockey Championships in Katowice {{were the}} first to feature {{professionals}} although in the end only the United States made use of the new rule, recalling eight pros from the Minnesota North Stars and Minnesota Fighting Saints. The first fully open World Championship was held in 1977 in Vienna, Austria, and saw the first participation of active Canadian NHL players, including two-time NHL MVP Phil Esposito. Sweden and Finland also augmented their rosters with a few NHL and WHA players. Many of the players on the Canadian team were <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> the tournament and were unfamiliar with the international game. The team finished fourth, losing both games to the Soviet Union by a combined score of 19–2. Czechoslovakia won gold, becoming the third team (after Canada and the Soviet Union) to win consecutive championships.|$|E

5|$|The second {{element of}} the {{auxiliary}} forces was the Yeomanry, 38 regiments of volunteer cavalry which had historically {{been used as a}} form of internal security police, deployed to suppress local riots and provide a show of force to support the authorities. Recruits to the force were usually personally wealthy, providing their own horses and uniforms, and units were often heavily bankrolled by their senior officers. Training requirements were low, with an annual eight-day camp. The regiments were liable to be called out for defence against an invasion or an insurrection, and were <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> effective mobilisation; the units possessed no transport resources, or even a designated quartermaster.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, {{having been}} {{preoccupied with the}} nerd situation, Homer is <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> his final exam. The nerds say {{the only way to}} pass is to cram for the final exam, which they help him do. However, despite Homer's best attempts, he gets an F. To Homer's delight, the nerds hack into the school's student records and change his grade to an A+, but unfortunately, Marge finds out and forces Homer to take the course again in order to set a good example for Bart and Lisa. Homer's next college {{experience}} is shown during the end credits, with college clichés such as hazing by a fraternity, phonebooth stuffing, a food fight, and finally his graduation ceremony where Homer flashes the audience.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, 400 hastily {{assembled}} US Army recruits {{arrived in}} Okinawa aboard the USS Walker. The inexperienced soldiers {{were assigned to}} the 29th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, a command that was preparing other battalions to move into Korea and to relieve the other units of the 24th Infantry Division. The new formations, now consisting mostly of soldiers who had no combat experience and grouped into two battalions, were immediately sent into Pusan. The headquarters of the regiment remained behind to form a new regiment. This regiment would originally {{be in charge of the}} defense of Okinawa but would later be rushed into Korea. The two battalions landed in Pusan on July 21 and {{were assigned to the}} 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division, but they retained their designations as the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 29th Infantry Regiment. Instead of being given time to train and prepare to enter the front lines, the battalions were immediately sent to the regiment's sector at Chinju. By July 22 the units were on the front lines with new equipment. The equipment, fresh from production lines, was <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> combat, despite promises from several commanders that the unit would be given time to do so.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Mycale, the Allied fleet {{sailed to}} the Hellespont {{to break down}} the pontoon bridges, but found that this had already been done. The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians {{remained}} to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians. The Persians and their allies made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region. Amongst them was one Oeobazus of Cardia, who had with him the cables and other equipment from the pontoon bridges. The Persian governor, Artayctes had <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> a siege, not believing that the Allies would attack. The Athenians therefore were able to lay a siege around Sestos. The siege dragged on for several months, causing some discontent amongst the Athenian troops, but eventually, when the food ran out in the City, the Persians fled at night from the least guarded area of the city. The Athenians were thus able to take possession of the city the next day.|$|E
5|$|At 19:00 the {{identifying}} {{lights in}} the mizzenmasts of the British fleet were lit. By this time, Guerrier had been completely dismasted and heavily battered. Zealous by contrast was barely touched: Hood had situated Zealous outside the arc {{of most of the}} French ship's broadsides, and in any case Guerrier was <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> an engagement on both sides simultaneously, with its port guns blocked by stores. Although their ship was a wreck, the crew of Guerrier refused to surrender, continuing to fire the few functional guns whenever possible despite heavy answering fire from Zealous. In addition to his cannon fire, Hood called up his marines and ordered them to fire volleys of musket shot at the deck of the French ship, driving the crew out of sight but still failing to secure the surrender from Captain Trullet. It was not until 21:00, when Hood sent a small boat to Guerrier with a boarding party, that the French ship finally surrendered. Conquérant was defeated more rapidly, after heavy broadsides from passing British ships and the close attentions of Audacious and Goliath brought down all three masts before 19:00. With his ship immobile and badly damaged, the mortally wounded Captain Etienne Dalbarade struck his colours and a boarding party seized control. Unlike Zealous, these British ships suffered relatively severe damage in the engagement. Goliath lost most of its rigging, suffered damage to all three masts and suffered more than 60 casualties. With his opponents defeated, Captain Gould on Audacious used the spring on his cable to transfer fire to Spartiate, the next French ship in line. To the west of the battle the battered Sérieuse sank over the shoal. Its masts protruded from the water as survivors scrambled into boats and rowed for the shore.|$|E
