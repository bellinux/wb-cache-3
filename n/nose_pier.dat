40|$|Rate of scour {{adjacent}} to piled foundations {{may result in}} rapidly loss of skin friction and load bearing capacity of the piles. The piles may be subjected to unplanned bending stresses, from lateral loads and hydrodynamic forces. The knowledge related to the time taken by different piers to achieve a certain scour depth is limited. In this study experiments were conducted using wooden pier models in the re-circulating glass sided tilting flume of 12, 5 m length, 300 mm width and 450 mm deep. In all three tests water depth, discharge, and mean approach flow velocity in the channel were kept constant. The flume was filled with cohessionless bed material (artificial sand) average grain diameter of 0. 203 mm to a uniform thickness. The scour depths observed from experiments were 30 mm, 16 mm and 14 mm in square, cylindrical and round <b>nosed</b> <b>piers</b> respectively. It was observed that, it takes more time for the cylindrical and round <b>nosed</b> <b>piers</b> to achieve scour depth of 22. 2 mm and 20 mm respectively as estimated by Breusers and Raudkivi 1991. The results also showed that: it takes shorter time for a square <b>nosed</b> <b>pier</b> to achieve its empirical scour depth value of 26. 7 mm. This indicates {{that the rate of}} scour depth development in square <b>nosed</b> <b>pier</b> is higher than that of the cylindrical and round <b>nosed</b> <b>piers</b> at a given time...|$|R

The uniform flow was established and a series of measurements having different discharges and channel bed slopes were undertaken. General results are established and then the effects of flow separation on the hydraulic theory are assessed. The Analysis of results shows that behind the bridge piers (horseshoe area); the amount of boundary shear stress reduces dramatically. The figure for the rate of boundary shear stress of nose to end is about &# 964; r = &# 964; n /&# 964; e = 3. 6. It has a remarkable reduction even in steep slopes. The bed shear stress was found to intensify near the <b>nose</b> of the <b>piers.</b> The distribution of boundary shear stress in both mild and steep channel bed slopes along spanwise direction is presented that may give a valuable perspective of the flow action around piers...|$|R
40|$|This Thesis {{describes}} {{the technology of}} building bridges with the launching technique, and it includes different types of launching techniques and their working equipment. Launching of heavy superstructures is described in detail. In our case that {{was the type of}} superstructure with reinforced concrete which had a box cross section. The main goal of this Thesis was to check the suitability of the chosen launching nose. In the introduction there is a brief overview of the history of building bridges. It also presents the most common techniques of building bridges, and the differences between them. The second chapter {{describes the}} difference between construction techniques of bridges with a launching method for light and heavy superstructures. Since the Thesis concentrates mainly on heavy superstructures, the following chapter describes the choice of bearings for the launching phase and the service phase in more detail as well as the possiblity of using the launching <b>nose,</b> temporary <b>piers</b> and cable – stayed front system. The next chapter describes the necessary prestressing, where the superstructure is prestressed separately for the construction phase and the service phase. In the case of launching bridges the prestressing is essential, because during construction the superstructure has to withstand a lot of load, which would not be possible without prestressing. Loads on the superstructure are enormous even in the completed form, but still smaller than in the beginning phase. The final part of Thesis describes the testing of the impact that a choice of launching nose has on the loading, particularly on the viaduct Dobruša which was built in 2008 on the highway Vrba - Peračica. First, the size of loading was determined with a theoretical model which included only the effects of its own weight, and later the software package Sofistik was used. In the second case all the impacts that actually have influence on the viaduct Dobruša have been taken into account for determining the load limit. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{downstream}} migration of salmon and steelhead in spring 1984 at Wells Dam on the mid-Columbia River was monitored using hydroacoustics. The primary {{objective of this}} research was to document run timing and describe the distribution of smolts at the dam. The study occurred from April 2 to June 15, 1984. Four transducers were deployed at the bases of <b>pier</b> <b>noses</b> at Turbines 3, 5, 7, and 9 and aimed up to 24 º into the forebay. They were sampled once every hour, 24 hours per day, for 75 days. An index of fish passage was reported daily to the Water Budget Center in Portland, Oregon. This index was computed as follows. For each 24 -h period, separate fish passage rates (number/time) at each of the four sampling locations were estimated by dividing the sum of the 2 ̆ 7 weighted 2 ̆ 7 fish detections by total sample time. These four values then were averaged to produce the daily index (number/day/location). The first substantial increase in fish passage occurred on April 25, 1984 due to the chinook released from the Winthrop hatchery on April 23. During May, run timing was fairly uniform except for peaks on May 2, 14, 18, and 22. The unexpected peak in run size that occurred from May 29 to June 2 could have been caused by juvenile mountain whitefish. Although the proportion of each species varied, chinook passage probably peaked in late April, and steelhead in {{the first two weeks of}} May; sockeye passage was variable throughout the study. The data indicated that most downstream migrants were distributed high in the water column and toward the western end of the dam. Average hourly passage rates for day and night were similar, but more fish passed the dam during the longer period of daylight than the shorter period of darkness...|$|R
40|$|Local scour around bridge {{foundations}} {{has been}} {{recognized as one of}} the main causes of bridge failures. The objective of this study is to investigate the relationships among field, laboratory, and numerical data for the purpose of improving scour prediction methods for complex bridge piers. In this study, three field sites in Georgia were selected for continuous monitoring and associated laboratory models were fabricated with physical scale ratios that modeled the full river and bridge cross sections to consider the effect of river bathymetry and bridge geometry. Three different sizes of sediment and several geometric scales of the bridge pier models were used in this study to investigate the scaling effect of relative sediment size, which is defined as the ratio of the pier width to the median sediment size. The velocity field for each bridge model was measured by the acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) to explain the complicated hydrodynamics of the flow field around bridge piers as guided by the results from a numerical model. In each physical model with river bathymetry, the comparison between the results of laboratory experiments and the measurements of prototype bridge pier scour showed good agreement for the maximum pier scour depth at the <b>nose</b> of the <b>pier</b> as well as for the velocity distribution upstream of each bridge pier bent. Accepted scour prediction formulae were evaluated by comparison with extensive laboratory and field data. The effect of relative sediment size on the local pier scour depth was examined and a modified relationship between the local pier scour depth and the relative sediment size was presented. A useful methodology for designing physical models was developed to reproduce and predict local scour depth around complex piers considering Froude number similarity, flow intensity, and relative sediment size.

40|$|The {{flow field}} around a bridge pier is complex in detail and the {{complexity}} is further increased {{with the development}} of a scour hole. As flow-induced scouring around piers can cause bridge failures, a good understanding of the flow field is important to the safe design of the hydraulic structures. The objective {{of this study is to}} simulate free-surface flow around a pier in a fixed scour hole, and to further determine shear stress distributions at the channel-bed. Simulations were mainly performed using mesh-based numerical models. The mesh-based numerical model was established using Reynolds averaged momentum and continuity equations in three dimensions, with the k-ɷ model for turbulence closure. The regions around the pier and near the channel-bed were resolved with sufficiently fine mesh so as to capture detailed velocity structures. To explore the appropriate procedures for applying smoothed particle hydrodynamics, a mesh-free model was formulated with kernel approximation of the field variables and particle approximation. The governing equations for dynamic fluid flows for the mesh-free model were written as a set of partial differential equations in Lagrangian description, known as the Navier-Stokes equations. The simulations were carried out under the same geometric and hydraulic conditions as in available laboratory experiments. One of the major findings of this research is that, both models predict a downflow near the upstream <b>nose</b> of the <b>pier</b> which would affect the stability of pier foundations. The mesh-based model results exhibit realistic vortex features around the pier and in the wake region. Another new finding is the occurrence of flow separation and complex vortex stretching confined to the upper water column behind the pier. The predicted bed shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy are shown to compare well with the experimental data. Application of the mesh-free model to the flow in a scour hole around a bridge pier has been successful in generating desired approach flow. Velocity profiles extracted from the results of both models at selected locations in the approach channel, inside the scour hole, are compared. The results presented in this thesis are of practical values for prediction of sediment scour around bridge piers...|$|R
40|$|The Due Hydroelectric Project is a {{proposed}} 50 MW run-of-river hydroelectric project {{being developed by}} Hidroalto SA. The project will be located on the Rio Due in Ecuador. The civil works of the intake facility will be comprised of a 133. 45 m wide diversion weir, with two overflow spillways and six gated sluice channels; a four bay intake structure with sediment excluder; and, a fish bypass facility. Northwest Hydraulic Consultants (NHC) evaluated the initial design of the Due intake and spillway facilities using a 1 : 35 Froude-scaled physical model for river discharges ranging from the intake design discharge of 57. 2 m 3 /s to the 1000 -year flood of 2, 339 m 3 /s. The testing in the physical model revealed some deficiencies {{in the performance of}} the initial design of the spillway stilling basins and some opportunities to reduce construction costs. Modifications to the initial design were proposed and evaluated in the model during the design optimization testing phase. The final recommended modifications included: adding a new stilling basin wall separating one of the overflow spillways from adjacent sluice channels; reducing the length of the stilling basin; decreasing the height and thickness of the stilling basin walls; and modifying <b>pier</b> <b>noses</b> to reduce flow disturbances. Furthermore, a sluice gate operation guideline was developed in order to maintain sufficient energy dissipation within the stilling basins for the range of river discharges covered in the study. The physical model was also utilized to evaluate the reservoir sediment flushing procedure and the performance of the intake sediment excluder. Fine sand was used in the model to simulate the reservoir deposits such that qualitative observations of the sediment flushing could be made. Accordingly, a sluice gate operating guideline was developed to maximize the sediment flushing from the reservoir. Finally, the physical model used light-weight sediments to evaluate the efficacy of the intake sediment excluder in trapping sediment to qualitatively observe the sediment load into the intake and the particle trapping process. Modifications to the intake sediment excluder were recommended to improve sediment trapping efficiency and reduce construction costs...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} the hydraulic model tests for the forebay structure of the Mayfield hydroelectric power plant conducted at the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory during the period May 1973 through March 1974. There are three existing power generating units, each of which is fed by an 18 -ft-diameter penstock. Provisions have been made for an additional unit to be installed in the near future. Water is taken from Mayfield Lake, conveyed through a 37 -ft-diameter tunnel, and discharged into a forebay. There are four intake structures, one for each penstock, at the downstream end of the forebay. Presently, the operation is hampered at high loading conditions. It is generally believed that unstable hydraulic conditions in the forebay are the cause of the present poor operating conditions. Strong vortices at the intakes have been observed in the field. The flow in the forebay is rough and turbulent. There are large shock waves at the <b>pier</b> <b>noses,</b> causing the water surface to fluctuate and become higher at units 42 and 43 and lower at unit 44. It is planned to add the fourth unit in the immediate future. Because an additional unit would mean an increased flow requirement, it is probable that the problems stated above would worsen. For this reason, a model study has been conducted to assess the problems for the expanded operation and find means of alleviating them. A 1 : 36 scale model was constructed and tested. After calibration, the model satisfactorily reproduced the existing flow conditions. The model indicated an increase in flow distortion and in water surface instability for the planned expansion. Air-entraining vortices were observed for all flows tested without modification of the existing facilities. On the basis of the experiments with various alternatives, the following schemes are recommended to provide good flow conditions: (a) two 18 -ft-wide submerged guide vanes to be installed near the tunnel portal to redistribute the flow and improve the water surface profile and (b) a V-shaped vortex suppressor to be installed at each intake bay to eliminate the air-entraining vortices. A documentary motion picture showing the highlights of the model tests has been made as part of this test program.

40|$|This work {{describes}} the free surface flow and clear water scour around an elongated vertical pier. Measurements were made using two-component Laser Doppler Anemometry, {{with the main}} objective of studying the turbulent sediment transport around elongated piers. The flow around a circular pier {{has been the subject}} of a large number of studies (e. g. Dargahi (1989), Graf (1998) Roulund et al. (2005)). When the pier is mounted on a sediment bed, the tri-dimensional flow field around the pier interacts with the bed of sediments (either cohesive or cohesionless) and originates clear water scour. The flow around a pier is characterized by the existence of a horseshoe vortex in front of the pier, which is responsible for the evolution of the scour process. The scour hole increases both in depth and in extension towards upstream, while the horseshoe vortex continues to excavate the sediment slope. As the sediments are suspended in the flow, they travel downstream and eventually fall and sediment in regions of lower turbulence. The scour cavity dimensions increase both upstream and downstream, until equilibrium is achieved. This phenomenon is usually studied by means of mathematical modelling (Kirkil et al. 2008, Kirkil et al. 2009), due to the experimental complexity of the scour process. The experimental work concerning initial conditions (Roulund et al., 2005), i. e. prior to scour cavities developing, can however provide adequate validation of models. Experiments were conducted in a 0. 4 m wide and 16. 7 m long flume, and the test section was installed approximately 9. 7 m downstream the beginning of the flume. The test section consisted of a rectangular vertical <b>pier</b> with round <b>nose</b> shapes. The <b>pier</b> was 4 cm wide and 8 cm long. Two alternative experimental configurations were studied: (i) the flow over a flat bottom and (ii) the flow over a sediment bed. In case (i) the pier was mounted in an acrylic plate 1. 8 m long, were a layer of uniform sand with 0. 376 mm mean diameter was glued, in order to reproduce the natural roughness of a river stream. In case (ii) the pier was mounted in a box, 10 cm deep and 1. 8 m long, filled in with uniform sand with a mean diameter of 0. 376 mm. The flow was controlled by a gate valve and measured by an electromagnetic flow meter (ABB, model IDE 41 F). Water depth was controlled by a sluice gate at the downstream extremity of the flume. The light source was an Argon-ion Laser (Spectra-Physics, Model 177 -G 0232) and the optical system was a Dantec 60 X 41 FiberFlow, including a 40 MHz frequency shifter and colour separation, combined with an 85 mm probe together with a beam expander and 500 mm front lens. A colour separator (55 X 35) split the collected light into 2 wavelengths before reaching the corresponding photomultipliers (Dantec 57 Ã 18). LDA data processing and acquisition was performed using BSA F 60 Flow analyser (Dantec). Simultaneous measurements of longitudinal (horizontal) and vertical velocities were made using the overlapped coincidence method. The flow was studied for water depths of 5 and 15 cm and mean horizontal approach velocities equal to 0. 17 and 0. 25 ms- 1. Measurements of horizontal and vertical velocities in the vicinity of an elongated pier show the strong interaction between the structure and the flow. In case (i) the flow decelerates as it approaches the pier, and is defected towards the bottom. In the wake of the pier there is a reverse flow until one pier diameter downstream, and then the flow starts to accelerate, as the influence of the pier disappears. In free surface flows Reynolds stresses usually present negative values, but in the present case, as the flow approaches the pier, Reynolds stresses become positive and increase. In case (ii) a similar flow pattern was found, but smaller turbulence intensities were measured...|$|R
