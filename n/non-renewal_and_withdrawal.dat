40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the usability of the deposit <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> slips for individuals with mental retardation in Taiwan. This paper first described the current state of the deposit <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> services in Taiwan to individuals with mental retardation. The person with mental retardation often tried hard to adapt himself/herself to the existing deposit <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> slips. This paper addressed the difficulties faced by users with mental retardation in comprehending the contents of the deposit <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> slips. The investigation into the low usability showed no consideration for meeting the demand of users with mental retardation. Thus, this paper proposed a new design of the deposit <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> slips that are adapted to users with mental retardation. The design approach was based on the principle of Universal Design. This paper finally offered some conclusions and suggestions for future work...|$|R

40|$|High relapse {{rates among}} smokers {{attempting}} to quit {{have been linked}} with failure to cope with cigarette cravings <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms. Smoking cravings <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> behavior {{is known to be}} influenced by stress and exposure to smoking cues. Exercise appears to reduce cigarette cravings <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms. However no study has investigated the effects of exercise on cue-elicited cravings <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms, or on ad libitum smoking behavior. Aim: Four experimental studies were designed {{to examine the effects of}} exercise on smoking behavior. Initial studies focused on the effects of a single session of brisk walk on cigarette cravings <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> symptom. Further research examined the effects ofthe walk on <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms <b>and</b> cravings and response to smoking cues and time spent on ad libitum smoking. Methods: All studies examined the effects of a short bout of brisk walking (15 - 20 minutes) versus a passive control condition. For the purposes of the experiments, participants were temporarily smoking abstinent or non-abstinent. Multiple and single item measures of cravings <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> as well as different experimental designs were used in order to enhance the reliability of the findings...|$|R
40|$|Motivated by {{applications}} to service systems, we develop simple engineering approximation formulas for the steady-state performance of heavily-loaded G/GI/n+GI multi-server queues, which can have non-Poisson <b>and</b> <b>non-renewal</b> arrivals <b>and</b> non-exponential service-time and patience-time distributions. The formulas {{are based on}} recently established Gaussian many-server heavy-traffic limits, but involve important heuristic refinements. Simulation experiments show that the proposed approximations are effective for both large-scale and small-scale queueing systems in both the efficiency-driven regime and the quality-and-efficiency-driven regime for a significant range of the traffic intensity ρ and the abandonment rate θ parameters, roughly for ρ> 1. 02 and θ < 2. 0...|$|R

Methods: All studies examined the effects of a short bout of brisk walking (15 - 20 minutes) versus a passive control condition. For the purposes of the experiments, participants were temporarily smoking abstinent or non-abstinent. Multiple and single item measures of cravings <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> as well as different experimental designs were used in order to enhance the reliability of the findings. In Studies 2, 3, and 4 after the exercise (or the control) participants were exposed to smoking cues. In these studies after the laboratory session, ad libitum smoking was determined from the subject's cell phone text message. Results: Cigarette cravings, <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms <b>and</b> negative affect decreased rapidly during exercise and remained reduced for 20 - 50 minutes after exercise. This pattern was robust across the four studies, across different abstinent periods, across single and multiple measures of cravings <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms, across experimental designs and across samples. Furthermore, it was shown that exercise attenuated increases in cue elicited cravings <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms. Results also indicated a two- to threefold longer time to the next cigarette following exercise. Exercise produced these effects by mimicking the relaxing effects of smoking. Conclusions: Short bouts of brisk walk are recommended as an aid to managing cigarette cravings <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
