Four days later, Ryan's teammate, Tom Seaver, topped {{it with a}} then MLB record 19 against the San Diego Padres (though Ryan would tie this record four years later). Ryan has credited his time with Seaver and the Mets with turning him from just a flamethrower to a pitcher. Contrary to popular belief, Ryan <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> traded from the Mets and felt betrayed by the team that drafted him. His views on this only calmed once he started running the Rangers and gained {{a better understanding of}} the business side of baseball.|$|E

He demanded his curtains, bedding, carpet, {{everything}} in his room be the color of green. Joseph studied agriculture and ran the farm after the death of his father, in addition to running his own nearby farm. Not liking the mansion's walls being decorated by the beautiful patterns, he painted over them, causing extensive damage. The mansions walls are being renovated as the funds are available, being painstakingly removed by a scalpel, carefully not to damage the original layer. Six layers of paint by Joseph nearly destroyed 171 years of art.|$|E

25|$|Franklin Pierce was {{a member}} of the U.S. House of Representatives by the time they married and became a U.S. Senator in 1837. She was forced to become the {{political}} wife she <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> Jane hated life in Washington, D.C., and encouraged her husband to resign his Senate seat and return to New Hampshire, which he did in 1842. She blamed politics for all the troubles in her life including the death of her child and Franklin's excessive alcohol consumption. Service in the Mexican-American War brought him the rank of Brigadier General and local fame as a hero. He returned home safely, and for four more years the Pierces lived quietly at Concord, New Hampshire. Unfortunately their son Frank passed from typhus a year later, causing stress for the entire family and leading to health issues for Jane. In 1842, President James K. Polk offered Franklin the U.S. attorney post; however, due to Jane's objection, he turned it down. A senate seat and New Hampshire governor was also offered, and again he turned it down for family reasons.|$|E

She also said if she had known this, she probably would never have recorded it.

[...] "I was always the only person with the nerve to sing, and so I got stuck with it". She has been regularly noted by critics for her husky vocals as well as her [...] "banshee" [...] screaming abilities. Her vocals have been compared to those of Johnny Rotten, and David Fricke of Rolling Stone described them as [...] "lung-busting" [...] and [...] "a corrosive, lunatic wail".

500|$|Many of his English contemporaries rated Hobbs {{superior}} to Donald Bradman, often {{regarded as the}} greatest batsman {{in the history of}} cricket, on difficult pitches. In difficult batting conditions Hobbs batted with great success, and several of his most highly regarded innings came in such circumstances. Murphy suggests: [...] "Before Bradman, he was the most consistent run-getter of all time, yet no one worried less about the sheer slog of carving out big scores." [...] Hobbs frequently was out deliberately soon after reaching a century—roughly a quarter of his centuries were scores less than 110—and was not particularly interested in most statistics. An article in Wisden in 2000 stated: [...] "He was never as dominant as Bradman; he <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> But his contemporaries were in awe of his ability to play supremely and at whim, whatever the conditions." ...|$|E
500|$|In general, the First Lady's {{desire for}} {{everything}} to appear just {{right in the}} White House led the residence staff to consider her not easy to work for, with tirades following what she perceived as mistakes.

I <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{on the wrong side}} of her." [...] She did show loyalty and respect to a number of the staff. In particular, she came to the public defense of a maid who was indicted on charges of helping to smuggle ammunition to Paraguay, providing an affidavit to the maid's good character (even though it was politically inopportune to do so at the time of the Iran–Contra affair); charges were subsequently dropped, and the maid returned to work at the White House.|$|E

500|$|However, writer Breanne Fahs {{describes}} Solanas as {{a contradiction}} which [...] "alienates {{her from the}} feminist movement." [...] Fahs argues that Solanas <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] "in movement" [...] but she nevertheless fractured the feminist movement by provoking N.O.W. members to disagree about her case. Many contradictions are seen in her lifestyle (a lesbian who sexually serviced men, claim of being asexual, confusion), a rejection of queer culture, and a non-interest in working with others despite a co-dependency on others. Fahs also brings into question the contradictory stories of Solanas's life. Solanas's life is described {{as one of a}} victim, a rebel, a desperate loner, yet Solanas's cousin says she worked as a waitress in her late 20s and 30s, not primarily as a prostitute, and friend Geoffrey LaGear said she had a [...] "groovy childhood." [...] Solanas also kept in touch with her father throughout her life, which makes one question and complicate the notion that Solanas hated her father and acted out this hatred in the shooting/manifesto. Fahs believes that Solanas embraced these contradictions as a key part of her identity.|$|E

He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey.

500|$|Madonna {{has stated}} that the song she most regrets {{recording}} is [...] "Material Girl" [...] and if she had known that the label would be attached to her for decades, she would probably never have done so. After making the video, Madonna said she <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> compared to Monroe, despite posing like her and recreating many of Monroe's signature poses for various photos shoots, most notably in a 1991 issue of Vanity Fair. Guilbert commented that [...] "material girl" [...] designated {{a certain type of}} liberated women, thus deviating from its original coinage which meant a girl who is tangible and accessible. Author Nicholas Cook said that the meaning and impact of [...] "material girl" [...] was no more circumscribed by the video, rather by its song. Its influence was seen later among such diverse groups such as female versus male, gay versus straight, and academic versus teenage. In 1993, a conference was held at the University of California at Santa Barbara, with the subject as Madonna: Feminist Icon or Material Girl? The conference pondered on the duality of Madonna as both of them and deduced that the question of Madonna's feminism is not easy to decide. Some of the feminists left the conference, citing that they {{had not been able to}} make up their minds.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by David Fincher and filmed in April 1989, at Culver Studios in Culver City, California. It was produced by Gregg Fienberg, under Propaganda Films, with editing by Scott Chestnut, principal photography by Mark Plummer, and Vance Lorenzini as the production designer. [...] "Express Yourself" [...] music video {{was inspired by the}} Fritz Lang classic film Metropolis (1927), and featured an epigraph {{at the end of the}} video from the film: [...] "Without the Heart, there can be no understanding between the hand and the mind". The video marked the first appearance of the Shep Pettibone remix of the song. It had a total budget of $5million ($ million in [...] dollars), which made it the most expensive music video in history at the time it was made, and currently the third most expensive of all time. [...] "Express Yourself" [...] had its world-premiere on May 17, 1989, on MTV and was an MTV exclusive for three weeks, being aired every hour on the music channel. The concept of the video was to portray Madonna as a glamorous lady and chained masochist, with muscular men acting as her workers. In the end, she picks one of them—played by model Cameron Alborzian—as her date. When Fincher explained this concept to Madonna, she was intrigued and decided to portray a masculine persona. She was dating actor Warren Beatty at that time, and asked him to play the part of a slave working at a factory; Beatty politely refused, saying later that [...] "Madonna wanted the video as a show case of her sexual prowess, I <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a part of it." [...] She then thought about Metropolis and of its scenes displaying factory workers and a city with tall skyscrapers. Fincher liked the concept and it became the main backdrop for the video. In Madonna 'Talking': Madonna in Her Own Words, she commented about the development of the video.|$|E
