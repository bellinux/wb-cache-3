The house is symmetrical, with matching corner turrets having bellcast roofs on each side.

Much in the {{way that}} such hits as [...] "Borderline" [...] and [...] "Into the Groove" [...] act as the {{fuselage}} of '80s pop [...] a lost-love elegy that squares <b>nicely</b> <b>with</b> the burgeoning female singer-songwriter movement of the '90s. Don't mistake its sleepy quality for stuffiness. This song is Madonna at her loveliest.|$|E

500|$|On {{the west}} side of the river, John H. Stevens platted a {{townsite}} in 1854. He laid out Washington Avenue parallel to the river, with other streets running parallel to and perpendicular to Washington. He later questioned his decision, thinking he should have run the streets directly east-west and north-south, but it ended up aligning <b>nicely</b> <b>with</b> the plat of St. Anthony. The wide, straight streets, with Washington and Hennepin Avenue being [...] wide and the others being [...] wide, contrasted with Saint Paul's streets that were [...] wide.|$|E
500|$|Schaffner rejects this etymology, as does Eichner, {{because the}} first element Sinht- cannot {{be based on the}} presupposed earlier Germanic *sinχt-. Such a Germanic form would have yielded Old High German *sīht by regular sound change. The amended Sinthgunt presupposes a Proto-Germanic {{compound}} *Senþa-gunþjō, the first element meaning [...] "raid, (military) campaign", the second one [...] "fight". This interpretation fits <b>nicely</b> <b>with</b> other Old High German female names such as Sindhilt (from *Senþa-χilðijō, with its second element also meaning [...] "fight", cf. Old Norse hilðr, Old English hild). Furthermore, Simek also mentions the interpretation [...] "heavenly body, star".|$|E
500|$|IGN's Vince Ingenito {{labeled the}} game as [...] "both a very good brawler and a big old sloppy love letter to fans". Ingenito praised the story mode, unique {{fighting}} game mechanics, and the overall use of the DC license, but criticized rough cutscene graphics, stating that bland textures and poorly modeled buildings eroded their visual impact. Game Informers Andrew Reiner considered {{the game as}} [...] "a finely tuned fighter" [...] that [...] "nails the spectacle of a superhero brawl". Reiner praised NetherRealm Studios for delivering a [...] "great fighting game experience", claiming that the NetherRealm Studios' appreciation for the DC universe blended <b>nicely</b> <b>with</b> their Mortal Kombat formula.|$|E

500|$|... "Raging Bully" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. DVD Talk's David Cornelius {{stated that he}} enjoyed Holyfield's guest appearance. Ed Liu, of Toon Zone, wrote that the episode and others included on the DVD The Fast and the Phineas were [...] "way too manic for their own good, never giving a gag enough time to develop a proper laugh before ripping off to the next one," [...] but considered Phineas's [...] "He's a Bully" [...] training montage {{to be one of}} the series' [...] "amusing video sequences." [...] A Wired magazine review for the soundtrack said that the [...] "He's a Bully" [...] was [...] "butt-rock," [...] but blended <b>nicely</b> <b>with</b> other melodies of completely different genres.|$|E
500|$|Additional {{positive}} feedback {{for the film}} came from Joblo.com reviewer Berge Garabedian, who praised director Bertino for [...] "building the tension <b>nicely,</b> <b>with</b> lots of silences, creepy voices, jump scares, use of songs and a sharp eye behind the camera, as well as plenty of Steadicam give it all more of a voyeuristic feel." [...] Empire Magazine remarked on the film's retro-style, saying, [...] "Like much recent horror, from the homages of the Grindhouse gang through flat multiplex remakes of drive-in classics, The Strangers looks to the '70s.", and ultimately branded the film as [...] "an effective, scary emotional work-out." [...] Slant Magazines Nick Schager listed The Strangers as the 9th best film of 2008. Also, the film was ranked #13 on [...] "Bravo's 13 Scarier Movie Moments" [...] television piece.|$|E

[...] Coach Harry Kipke shifted Petoskey to fullback midway through the 1932 season, and he scored two touchdowns in a 32–0 win over Illinois. [...] The United Press noted: [...] "A running attack which featured Ted Petoskey, converted from an end to a fullback in the last week by Coach Harry Kipke dovetailed <b>nicely</b> <b>with</b> the Wolverine aerial play to produce the touchdowns. [...] With Petoskey plunging the line and sweeping inside the ends for many sizeable gains, the Michigan eleven showed power through the line {{for the first time this}} season." [...] An Associated Press writer warned opponents to watch out for Petoskey: [...] "It is about time for grid foeman to wake up when Ted Petoskey, end and fullback on the University of Michigan football team, gets to dreaming.

[...] Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic considered [...] "Sometimes" [...] a competent single, but claimed the song as unremarkable. Kyle Anderson of MTV said that the song [...] "introduces the first sorta-ballad to ," [...] and considered it [...] "reasonable enough, though through three songs Spears' lyric approach appears to be entirely about guys. Like, she never stops thinking about them." [...] Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone called [...] "Sometimes" [...] a [...] "further hit" [...] from ...Baby One More Time, along with [...] "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy". Spence D. of IGN considered [...] "Sometimes" [...] a [...] " [...] glossy grown-up pop" [...] song, while Annabel Leathes of BBC Online said the song [...] "represent the innocent years when Britney annoyed and titillated in equal measure."

500|$|Sarah Godfrey of The Washington Post {{called it}} a [...] "straightforward country-pop piece", while Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic named it [...] "a slow, bluesy closer". Christina Garibaldi of MTV News praised Shelton's [...] "smooth" [...] and country vocals on the [...] "hearbreaking" [...] ballad, which fits <b>nicely</b> <b>with</b> Aguilera's [...] "booming" [...] ones. Melinda Newman of HitFix {{analyzed}} that Aguilera's voices on [...] "Just a Fool" [...] sounded like former longtime producer Linda Perry as she sings [...] "yeah, yeah, yeah", but Shelton's sounds [...] "rose to the occasion" [...] and plays the [...] "perfect partner". [...] Michael Galluci of PopCrush praised Aguilera's [...] "great" [...] "throaty rasp" [...] on the track. Jim Farber of New York Daily News provided a mixed review, writing that [...] " [...] sings with measured resolve while [...] nearly suffocates him. It's certainly a powerful approach, but it comes {{at the cost of}} communicating genuine soul". Negatively, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it [...] "an out-of-place country-pop duet with Blake Shelton, who feels like a cheap cash-in", while Annie Zaleskie for The A.V. Club criticized its [...] "schmaltzy" [...] sound.|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{wrote that}} [...] "Christmas Attack Zone" [...] was a [...] "nice holiday outing {{with a lot}} of great gag-writing", however [...] "...I wouldn't put this up there with the show's best Christmas episodes. But I'd say it fits in <b>nicely</b> <b>with</b> the general run of {{competency}} to excellence we've been seeing so far this season. It was modestly funny, a little sweet, and not at all horrible." [...] Alan Sepinwall from HitFix who is not a fan of Elaine Stritch's role on the show enjoyed her in this episode, writing that along with the appearances of Elizabeth Banks and Alan Alda [...] "I decided to hope their presence would counteract my feelings about hers – which is pretty much what happened." [...] Sepinwall enjoyed the subplots commenting that Tracy's [...] "played well" [...] and Jenna and Paul's [...] "was both sweet and ridiculous". Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student said it was [...] "a ton of fun to watch" [...] all the subplots play out and considered [...] "Christmas Attack Zone" [...] as [...] "probably one of the two or three best episodes of the season thus far.

500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{was positive}} about the episode, writing [...] "This was the strongest overall Thursday this season for NBC's comedies, and 'Sun Tea' brought the evening to a fine close. Not all of it worked, but enough of it did... that I was left happy." [...] He opined that if the episode gave more time to Kathy being represented by Teddy Ruxpin [...] "I would have given 'Sun Tea' my stamp of approval". In regards to the environment story, Sepinwall said it [...] "tied in <b>nicely</b> <b>with</b> both Frank's disgusting jars and the apartment plot". Nick Catucci [...] of New York magazine said that the episode was [...] "chockablock with great mini-sketches, gags, and flights of fancy." [...] Catucci enjoyed Tracy's Cosby dream, while he was anesthetized, calling it [...] "delightful". The A.V. Clubs Steven Hyden enjoyed the episode, writing it was [...] "one of the funniest and most enjoyable episodes of the season." [...] Hyden commented that Liz's plot had [...] "a string of craaazy [...] jokes. But they were amusing to laugh-out-loud jokes." [...] "I wouldn't claim {{that it was an}} absolutely top tier episode [...] but what the hell, it had some pretty great moments", said Sean Gandert for Paste magazine. Gandert enjoyed Jack/Tracy and Liz's plots, respectively, was glad that Chris Parnell returned as Dr. Spaceman, and said that Gore [...] "also rarely disappoints", but was not complimentary towards NBC [...] " [...] its green week thing" [...] into [...] "Sun Tea". Time contributor James Poniewozik observed that [...] "the best bits" [...] from this episode were [...] "Teddy Ruxpin the lawyer; the declaration that 'I, Bertram Geiss, am still Daddy's fancy boy'; and, especially, the show's treatment of the Green Is Universal mandate." ...|$|E
