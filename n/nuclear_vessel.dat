50|$|Insurance of <b>nuclear</b> <b>vessels</b> is {{not like}} the {{insurance}} of conventional ships. The consequences of an accident could span national boundaries, and the magnitude of possible damage is beyond the capacity of private insurers. A special international agreement, the Brussels Convention on the Liability of Operators of Nuclear Ships, developed in 1962, would have made signatory national governments liable for accidents caused by <b>nuclear</b> <b>vessels</b> under their flag but was never ratified owing to disagreement on the inclusion of warships under the convention. Nuclear reactors under United States jurisdiction are insured by {{the provisions of the}} Price Anderson Act.|$|R
50|$|The Ship/Submarine Recycling Program (SRP) is {{the process}} that the United States Navy uses to dispose of {{decommissioned}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>vessels.</b> SRP takes place only at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS) in Bremerton, Washington, but the preparations can begin elsewhere.|$|R

50|$|The ships had a {{relatively}} short service lives. As with any nuclear powered ship, they were expensive to operate. The class was just coming up for their mid-life reactor refuelings just as the 1994 Defense Authorization Bill was being formulated, which would impact cuts of 38% to the Navys budget, compared to the 1993 bill. The $300-million-plus cost of each refueling and other upgrades made the class easy targets for decommissioning. Each ship was therefore retired starting with Texas in July 1993 and ending with Arkansas in 1998, and each ship went through the <b>nuclear</b> <b>vessel</b> (ships and submarines) decommissioning and recycling program.|$|E
5000|$|Erich Rudolf Bagge (30 May 1912, Neustadt bei Coburg [...] - [...] 5 June 1996, Kiel) was a German scientist. Bagge, {{a student}} of Werner Heisenberg for his {{doctorate}} and Habilitation, was engaged in German Atomic Energy research and the German nuclear energy project during the Second World War. He worked as an Assistant at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Physik in Berlin. Bagge, who became associated professor at the University of Hamburg in 1948, was in particular involved in the usage of nuclear power for trading vessels, {{and he was one}} of the founders of the Society for the Usage of Nuclear Energy in Ship-Building and Seafare. The first German <b>nuclear</b> <b>vessel,</b> the [...] "NS Otto Hahn", was launched in 1962. A research reactor was installed in Geesthacht near Hamburg at about the same time which has over the years formed into a center for materials research with neutrons.|$|E
40|$|Could {{nuclear power}} be rapidly {{expanded}} {{on a global}} scale? There {{are a number of}} practical limiting factors, including site availability and acceptability, nuclear waste disposal issues, and the risks of accidents and proliferation. But there are also a variety of resource limitations. One particular resource limitation that has not been clearly articulated in the nuclear debate thus far is the availability of the relatively scarce metals used {{in the construction of the}} reactor vessel and core. While this scarcity is not of immediate concern, it would present a hard limit to the ultimate expansion of nuclear power. This limit appears to be a harder one than the supply of uranium fuel. An increased demand for rare metals-such as hafnium, beryllium, zirconium, and niobium, for example-would also increase their price volatility and limit their rate of uptake in nuclear power stations. Metals used in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>vessel</b> eventually become radioactive and, on decommissioning, those with long half-lives cannot be recycled on timescales useful to human civilization. Thus, a large-scale expansion of nuclear power would reduce "elemental diversity" by depleting the world's supply of some elements and making them unavailable to future generations.

40|$|Among many {{engineering}} {{advantages in}} concrete, low thermal conductivity {{is an attractive}} property. Concrete has been widely used for nuclear vessels and plant facilities for its excellent radiation shielding. The heat isolation through low thermal conductivity is actually positive for nuclear power plant concrete; however the property may cause adverse effect when fires and melt-down occur in <b>nuclear</b> <b>vessel</b> since cooling down from outer surface is almost impossible due to very low thermal conductivity. If concrete containing atomic reactor has higher thermal conductivity, the explosion risk of conductive may be partially reduced. This paper presents high thermally conductive concrete development. For the work, magnetite with varying replacements of normal aggregates and steel powder of 1. 5 % of volume are considered, and the equivalent thermal conductivity is evaluated. Only when the replacement ratio goes up to 30 %, thermal conductivity increases rapidly to 2. 5 times. Addition of steel powder is evaluated to be effective by 1. 08 ~ 1. 15 times. In order to evaluate the improvement of thermal conductivity, several models like ACI, DEMM, and MEM are studied, and their results are compared with test results. In the present work, the effects of steel powder and magnetite aggregate are studied not only for strength development but also for thermal behavior based on porosity...|$|E

50|$|As {{a simple}} example, {{narrowband}} analysis might identify whether {{a subject of}} interest has single or multiple propeller shafts; how many blades per shaft and other salients that may help identify the platform. This may include the fundamental or harmonic emissions based on the electric services used, the gearing between shaft and engine and also the combination of gear teeth used in the ratio(s). For <b>nuclear</b> <b>vessels,</b> necessary pump frequencies can be detected.

30|$|Nuclear {{propulsion}} {{has been}} a hope {{but they have not}} proven to be of any commercial success (Hass, 2014; Radiationworks, 2015). Nevertheless, there is a technical potential because nuclear-powered aircraft carriers match the size of container giants at 100, 000 tons and cruise at up to 35 knots, although at a prohibitive cost (Carlton et al., 2011; DNV, 2014; Gu & Zhang, 2014). Currently, it is regarded as unrealistic to renew plans for commercial <b>nuclear</b> <b>vessels</b> for both economic and public opinion reasons. Neither significantly increasing speeds with current diesel engine designs nor fitting ships with steam turbines, like the Sea Land Commerce that crossed the Pacific at 33 knots average speed in 1973 (Schoyen and Steger-Jensen, 2017), would be economically justified. However, the potential for new propulsion technology for fast and economical sea transport remains to be seen.|$|R
