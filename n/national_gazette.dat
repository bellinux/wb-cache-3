5|$|Washington was not {{a member}} of any {{political}} party and hoped {{that they would not be}} formed, fearing conflict that would undermine republicanism. His closest advisors formed two factions, setting the framework for the future First Party System. Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton had bold plans to establish the national credit and to build a financially powerful nation, and he formed the basis of the Federalist Party. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson was the founder of the Jeffersonian Republicans, and he strenuously opposed Hamilton's agenda. Washington typically favored Hamilton over Jefferson, and it was Hamilton's agenda that went into effect. Jefferson's political actions, his support of Philip Freneau's <b>National</b> <b>Gazette,</b> and his attempt to undermine Hamilton nearly led George Washington to dismiss him from his cabinet, though he ultimately left the cabinet voluntarily. Washington never forgave him and never spoke to him again.|$|E

The <b>National</b> <b>Gazette</b> made particular criticism of the policies promoted by Alexander Hamilton, often through anonymous essays signed by the pen name Brutus at Jefferson's urging, which were actually written by Madison.|$|E

25|$|James Aronson and Cedric Belfrage were {{committed}} {{activists in the}} Wallace for President campaign and {{in the run-up to}} the Progressive Party nominating convention they renewed their acquaintance and revived plans for an independent radical newspaper in the United States. The duo were joined in this effort by John T. McManus, a former staff member of the liberal newspaper PM and former head of the left wing Newspaper Guild in the state of New York, and Josiah Gitt, publisher of a liberal newspaper in the town of York, Pennsylvania. In July 1948 these four — with Gitt listed as publisher and Aronson, Belfrage, and McManus as editors — launched a sample publication called The <b>National</b> <b>Gazette</b> and circulated it at the Progressive Party Nominating Convention.|$|E
500|$|In 1822, Conwell {{showed his}} support for Harold by {{appointing}} him as Vicar General of the diocese. The Hogan schism took on new dimensions, however, when Hogan was charged with rape and battery. Philadelphia mayor Robert Wharton presided over the trial, which captured the city's attention. Although the jury found him not guilty, Hogan's image was harmed. A letter from the Pope sided with Conwell but, after initially agreeing to leave the diocese, Hogan reversed himself and stayed on. The pro-Hogan faction prevailed at St. Mary's trustee elections that year amid bloody rioting between parish members. The next year, 1823, some Hogan supporters convinced a local woman to bring a paternity suit against Conwell, but the charges were dismissed quickly and the complainant was convicted of perjury. In an 1824 letter to the <b>National</b> <b>Gazette,</b> Hogan proposed {{the creation of an}} [...] "American Catholic Church" [...] with more independence from Rome.|$|E
2500|$|A lengthy {{obituary}} {{devoted to}} Bishop White in the <b>National</b> <b>Gazette</b> and Literary Register described him thus: [...] "...he {{duties of the}} several important relations in which he stood to society were performed with undeviating correctness and suavity; he possessed the rare merit of winning the respect and love of an entire community {{to which he was}} an ornament and a blessing. [...] His piety was deep and unfeigned; his walking humble yet dignified; his acquirements profound; in his mind the welfare of the Christian church was always the prominent consideration...He was one of those examples of steady virtue sent upon earth by Divine providence, as if to prove how near the great pattern of perfection it is permitted to approach." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{the inauguration}} of the Musical Fund Society in 1820, musical {{activity}} in Philadelphia greatly increased. By the mid-19th century the city was a national center for musical development, with local religious music changing considerably, and new styles becoming regionally popular, especially English opera. [...] An important concert was held in Philadelphia in the mid-19th century, {{one of the first}} major concerts in the country led by a chorus, in this case from the College of Philadelphia. Philadelphia saw the première in 1845 of the first American grand opera, Leonora by composer and music journalist of the <b>National</b> <b>Gazette</b> and the Public Ledger, William Henry Fry. The opera was written in the Italian style and admired so much that it was performed 16 times that season.|$|E
6000|$|Cyrus {{waited for}} the curtain to rise, feeling as if {{every one of his}} Spring Valley {{neighbours}} must know where he was and revile him for it. If Deborah were ever to find out ... but Deborah must never find out! For {{the first time in their}} married life the old man deliberately plotted to deceive his old wife. He must see his girl Josie just once; it was a terrible thing that she was an actress, but she was a successful one, nobody could deny that, except fools who yapped in the <b>National</b> <b>Gazette.</b>|$|E

Mainwaring found the family sitting {{under one of}} the still leafless chestnut trees, Captain Cooper smoking his long clay pipe and lazily perusing a copy of the <b>National</b> <b>Gazette.</b> Eleazer listened {{with a great deal of}} interest to what Mainwaring had to say of his proposed cruise. He himself knew a great deal about the pirates, and, singularly unbending from his normal, stiff taciturnity, he began telling of what he knew, particularly of Captain Scarfield--in whom he appeared to take an extraordinary interest.|$|E

I knew that <b>National</b> <b>Gazette</b> man didn't know what he was talking about. Mother, let us go and see Josie right off.

She went over that evening and {{borrowed}} it, saying that their own had been burned before she had had time to read the serial in it. With one exception she read all its columns carefully without finding anything to explain her husband's anger. Then she doubtfully plunged into the exception ... a column of [...] "Stage Notes." [...] Halfway down she came upon an adverse criticism of Joscelyn Morgan and her new play. It was malicious and vituperative. Deborah Morgan's old eyes sparkled dangerously as she read it.|$|E
60|$|Great {{heat and}} {{asperity}} were {{manifested in the}} discussions of Congress throughout the present session. Washington had observed with pain the political divisions which were {{growing up in the}} country; and was deeply concerned at finding that they were pervading the halls of legislation. The press, too, was contributing its powerful aid to keep up and increase the irritation. Two rival papers existed at the seat of government; one was Fenno's Gazette, of the United States, the other was the <b>National</b> <b>Gazette,</b> edited by Philip Freneau. Freneau had been editor of the New York Daily Advertiser, but had come to Philadelphia in the autumn of 1791 to occupy the post of translating clerk in Mr. Jefferson's office, and had almost immediately (Oct. 31) published the first number of his Gazette. Notwithstanding his situation {{in the office of the}} Secretary of State, Freneau became and continued to be throughout the session, a virulent assailant of most of the measures of government; excepting such as originated with Mr. Jefferson, or were approved by him.|$|E
