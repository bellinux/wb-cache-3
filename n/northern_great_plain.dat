40|$|Like {{many parts}} of the world, the <b>Northern</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Plains</b> faces immense {{challenges}} to sustainable land use. Privately owned conservation areas have emerged as a potential solution. This article reviews five global trends in so-called private protected areas and discusses their implications for the <b>Northern</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Plains.</b> The trends point to five recommendations to the <b>Northern</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Plains</b> community: (1) act now to tap rapidly growing policy support; (2) combine many models, including private protected areas that are owned by individuals and groups, formal and informal, large and small, and are dedicated to strict protection as well as sustainable use; (3) cultivate diverse revenue streams with emphasis on carbon payments, hunting, and tourism; (4) connect spatially through private-public or private-private partnerships to generate both ecological and economic benefits; and (5) cultivate a reputation for delivering high-quality products and services. The trends and recommendations should be of interest wherever landowners, policy makers, academics, and others seek to integrate economics with ecology in the <b>Northern</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Plains...</b>|$|R

40|$|More {{than three-quarters}} {{of the land in}} the <b>Northern</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Plains</b> is privately owned and less than 2 % of the region is in public {{protected}} areas; therefore, sound private-land management is critical for restoring and conserving the region’s biodiversity. Although considerable {{progress has been made in}} recent years in fostering and assembling nature reserves on private lands in various regions of the world, this approach has received little attention in North America, including the <b>Northern</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Plains.</b> We review here recommendations, trends and issues related to private protected areas globally and in Canada and the United States. We then discuss socioeconomic and ecological conditions that deserve particular attention in creating private protected areas, which we prefer to call “private nature reserves,” in the <b>Northern</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Plains.</b> We conclude with proposed standards and guidelines for the establishment and recognition of private nature reserves in the region...|$|R
