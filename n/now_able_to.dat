5|$|Also {{beginning}} in 2012, sighted guides became eligible to receive medals in certain events; sighted goalkeepers in 5-a-side football, along with guides and pilots in athletics and cycling and boccia assistants were <b>now</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> receive medals for their contributions. Previously {{in the case}} of tandem cycling, where a visually-impaired rider takes the rear of the bike with a sighted pilot in front, only the visually-impaired rider actually received a medal.|$|E
5|$|By 1806, the French {{squadron}} under Rear-Admiral Charles Linois {{departed for}} the Atlantic Ocean and a British expeditionary force captured the Cape of Good Hope. Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew, {{commander of the}} British Royal Navy in {{the eastern half of}} the Indian Ocean at Madras in British India in the eastern half of the Indian Ocean was <b>now</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> concentrate on a major threat to British shipping in the region; the Dutch squadron based in the Dutch East Indies, specifically on Java at the port of Batavia.|$|E

5|$|During the 1780s, Johnson {{achieved}} success: he {{did well}} financially and his firm published more books with other firms. Although Johnson had begun {{his career as a}} relatively cautious publisher of religious and scientific tracts, he was <b>now</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> take more risks and he encouraged friends to recommend works to him, creating a network of informal reviewers. Yet Johnson's business was never large; he usually had only one assistant and never took on an apprentice. Only {{in the last years of}} his life did two relatives assist him.|$|E
5|$|Fleetwood {{continued}} to grow without its principal investor, albeit slowly. As a port, it soon faced competition from Lytham and Preston. In 1847 Queen Victoria and Prince Albert travelled through Fleetwood {{on their way to}} London from Scotland, but that year saw the decline of the town's importance on the route to Scotland. More powerful locomotives were <b>now</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> travel over hilly terrain, and the railway was extended over Shap Fell all the way to Scotland; Fleetwood was no longer needed as a sea link.|$|E
5|$|Philip was <b>now</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{turn to the}} Illyrians, {{who were}} still occupying much of upper Macedon (whether agreed by treaty or not). He held an {{assembly}} of the army, gathered together a force of 10,000 men and 600 cavalry and marched into Illyria. Bardylis, hearing of the preparations, sent ambassadors to Philip, proposing peace {{on the basis of}} the status quo. Philip rejected this, insisting that the Illyrians must withdraw completely from Macedonia, so Bardylis instead prepared for battle, raising 10,000 men and 500 cavalry, according to Diodorus.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem was}} further {{addressed}} in 2014 when Greyhound rolled {{out a new}} yield management computer system. With the new system, Greyhound is <b>now</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> more closely manage the number of tickets sold for each departure and dynamically adjust pricing based on sales. Although the amount of overbooked buses has been sharply reduced with this new system, Greyhound still does not explicitly guarantee a seat to everyone with a ticket (except on Greyhound Express routes).|$|E
5|$|Although the ZNDH was <b>now</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> mount a {{credible}} threat against the insurgents, by {{then a new}} menace was arriving {{from the other side}} of the Adriatic. On 30 June 1943, the first Allied reconnaissance flights were reported, followed by the first USAAF bombers, when 61 B-24 Liberators of IX Bomber Command overflew the NDH on a deep penetration raid on the Austrian city of Wiener Neustadt on 13 August. The ZNDH's 3rd Flak Group, defending Brod na Savi (Slavonski Brod), managed to shoot down a single bomber en route to its target. The best aircraft that the ZNDH could put up to defend its homeland at the end of 1943 were 20 Morane-Saulnier M.S.406s, 10 Fiat G.50s, six Fiat CR.42s, five Avia BH-33s and two Ikarus IK-2 fighters – aircraft that had been obsolete in 1940.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{a number}} of {{different}} drivers were considered, but the introduction of the laser a few years later provided the first obvious solution with the right combination of features. The desired energies were well beyond {{the state of the art}} in laser design, so LLNL began a laser development program in the mid-1960s to reach these levels. Each increase in energy led to new and unexpected optical phenomena that had to be overcome, but these were largely solved by the mid-1970s. Working in parallel with the laser teams, physicists studying the expected reaction using computer simulations adapted from thermonuclear bomb work developed a program known as LASNEX that suggested Q of 1 could be produced at much lower energy levels, in the kilojoule range, levels that the laser team were <b>now</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> deliver.|$|E

5|$|Bran Stark and the Three-eyed Raven {{observe a}} vision of the Children of the Forest {{creating}} the Night King by impaling a man with a dragonglass dagger. Bran subsequently confronts Leaf, one of the Children, about creating the White Walkers. She explains that they were at war with the First Men, and had no choice. Bran decides to observe a vision without the Three-Eyed Raven. He witnesses a massive army of wights led by the Night King, who touches him whilst in the vision. Bran awakens to find a mark where he was touched, and the Three-Eyed Raven warns that he must leave, as the Night King is <b>now</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> find them.|$|E
5|$|Dio {{maintains}} that one purpose for Caracalla issuing the edict was {{the desire to}} increase state revenue; at the time, Rome was in a difficult financial situation and needed {{to pay for the}} new pay raises and benefits that were being conferred on the military. The edict widened the obligation for public service and gave increased revenue through the inheritance and emancipation taxes that only had to be paid by Roman citizens. The provincials also benefited from this edict because they were <b>now</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> think of themselves as equal partners to the Romans in the empire. However, few of those that gained citizenship were wealthy, and {{while it is true that}} Rome was in a difficult financial situation, it is thought that this could not have been the sole purpose of the edict.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} days of Operation Goodwood Royal Navy {{planners}} decided not to order further Fleet Air Arm operations against Kaafjord. The planners accepted that the Germans were <b>now</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> cover Tirpitz in smoke before Barracudas could reach the battleship, and these aircraft could not carry bombs large enough to inflict heavy damage. Further consideration was given to attacking Kaafjord using Mosquitos launched from aircraft carriers, but the light bombers continued to be in short supply and it was judged that they were not well suited to the task. Moreover, there was a growing need to transfer the carriers to the Pacific to strengthen Britain's contribution to the war against Japan.|$|E

5|$|Enterprise {{approaches}} within transporter range, and beams an away team (including Phlox) to the facility. They are soon detected, however, {{and imprisoned}} with the facility's staff. Meanwhile, Commander T'Pol, having {{lost contact with}} the team, attempts to destroy the station, but the Klingon ship intervenes. Malik uses Phlox's friendship to finally coerce the security codes from Lucas (by threatening to expose him to a pathogen as well). Soong, who had previously stolen 19 genetically enhanced and frozen embryos from C-12, is <b>now</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> access the remaining 1,800, a carry-over from the Eugenics Wars. Soong and the Augments then escape, but not before Malik kills Smike, helps himself {{to a number of}} pathogen samples, and sets the viral containment fields to fail.|$|E
5|$|In 212, the constitutio Antoniniana (Antonine decree) of emperor Caracalla granted Roman {{citizenship}} {{to all the}} free inhabitants of the Empire– the peregrini– thus abolishing their second-class status. But {{there is no evidence}} that the citizens-only rule for legions was also abolished at this time. The legions simply gained a much wider recruitment base, as they were <b>now</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> recruit any male free resident of the empire. Auxiliary units were now recruited mainly from Roman citizens, but probably continued to recruit non-citizen barbari from outside the Empire's borders. However, the citizens-only rule for legions appears to have been dropped some time during the 3rd century, as by the 4th-century Romans and barbarians are found serving together in all units.|$|E
5|$|In May 1938, Bush {{accepted}} a prestigious appointment {{as president of}} the Carnegie Institution of Washington (CIW), which had been founded in Washington, D.C. Also known as the Carnegie Institution for Science, it had an endowment of $33 million, and annually spent $1.5 million in research, most of which was carried out at its eight major laboratories. Bush became its president on January 1, 1939, with a salary of $25,000. He was <b>now</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> influence research policy in the United States at the highest level, and could informally advise the government on scientific matters. Bush soon discovered that the CIW had serious financial problems, and he had to ask the Carnegie Corporation for additional funding.|$|E

5|$|In late August it {{was decided}} that further Fleet Air Arm attacks should not be {{attempted}} as the Germans were <b>now</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> cover Tirpitz in smoke before Barracudas could reach the battleship, and these aircraft could not carry bombs large enough to inflict heavy damage. As it was still seen as desirable to destroy Tirpitz, the task was assigned to Bomber Command. On 15 September a force of heavy bombers attacked Kaafjord after refuelling at bases in northern Russia and inflicted irreparable damage on the battleship. Following this, Tirpitz sailed to an anchorage near Tromsø to be used as an immobile coastal defence battery. Another heavy bomber attack on 29 October caused only minor damage, and a third raid was mounted on 12 November in which Tirpitz was struck by several Tallboy bombs and capsized with heavy loss of life among her crew.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{a backup}} relief party of 77 teams and wagons was {{making its way}} east to provide {{additional}} assistance to the Martin Company. After passing Fort Bridger {{the leaders of the}} backup party concluded that the Martin Company must have wintered east of the Rockies, so they turned back. When word of the returning backup relief party was communicated to Young, he ordered the courier to return and tell them to turn back east and continue until they found the handcart company, but several days had been lost. On November 18 the backup party met the Martin Company with the greatly needed supplies. At last {{all the members of the}} handcart party were <b>now</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> ride in wagons. The 104 wagons carrying the Martin Company arrived in Salt Lake City on November 30; at least 145 members of the company had lost their lives. Many of the survivors had to have fingers, toes, or limbs amputated due to severe frostbite.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1798, {{during the}} Battle of the Nile, a British fleet under Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson {{destroyed}} the French Mediterranean Fleet at Aboukir Bay on the Egyptian coast. The battle completely reversed the strategic {{situation in the}} Mediterranean: British forces had evacuated the region in 1796 after the Treaty of San Ildefonso brought Spain into the war on the French side, but they were <b>now</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> return in large numbers. As French maritime lines of communication were cut, the French Armée d'Orient under General Napoleon Bonaparte became trapped in Egypt. Unable to return to Europe by sea, the army attempted and failed to pass overland through Palestine and was subsequently abandoned by Bonaparte, who returned to France with his closest advisors in the frigates Muiron and Carrère in November 1799, promising to send reinforcements to the forces that remained in North Africa.|$|E
