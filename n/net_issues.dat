40|$|The 1990 s saw {{a global}} trend toward {{increased}} banking concen-tration. Given that this emergence of larger financial institutions {{seems to be}} a permanent change, understanding the implications of the trend is a highly relevant exercise, in particular for small coun-tries like Chile. This paper analyzes safety <b>net</b> <b>issues</b> for a highly concentrated banking system in which, in addition, the total number of players (banks) is low. The safety net is commonly understood as the set of institutions created to guarantee the proper functioning of the financial system (financial institutions and markets) in the economy. It is typically considered to serve the following functions: regulation and supervision, lender of last resort, and deposit insur-ance. Regulation includes mechanisms for bank closure. One point of this paper is that the importance of these functions and the way they have to be designed or executed is not independent of either the level of concentration or the total number of banks in the system. Recom-mendations of best practices, then, have to take these considerations into account. This paper analyzes two dimensions of the impact of concentra-tion on the banking safety net. The first is deposit insurance. In recent years, important efforts in understanding deposit insurance and deriving best practices for it has been made (see Demirgüç-Kun...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The return {{predictability}} of <b>net</b> stock <b>issues</b> and profitability {{has changed}} {{significantly in the}} past four decades. While the return-profitability relation has weakened, the return-net stock issues relation has strengthened over time. A model of investment under uncertainty with convex external financing costs suggests that the decreasing level and decreasing persistence of firm profitability may explain the time-varying return predictability of <b>net</b> stock <b>issues</b> and profitability, respectively. We provide empirical evidence that while the change in firm fundamentals (i. e., profitability) can fully explain the time trend in the return predictability of <b>net</b> stock <b>issues,</b> investor sentiment cannot, contrary to what the market timing theory suggests. The return predictability of <b>net</b> stock <b>issues</b> increases more significantly for small, growth, and young firms since these firms tend to experience a larger decrease in the level of profitability over time...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} mispricing and financing waves on the decisions (1) to issue equity or debt and (2) to repurchase equity or debt. We use a large international data set from 51 countries (22 developed and 29 emerging market countries) in the period from 1984 to 2006. Our results are consistent first with mispricing. The equity shares in <b>net</b> <b>issues</b> occur relatively more, and the equity shares in net repurchases occur relative less after periods of high stock returns. This finding is robust for the US firms, under different levels of economic development (developed and emerging markets), different economic regimes (bank and market-based), and different legal systems (common and civil). Moreover, prior returns are higher before issuing equity and preferred stock and lower before repurchasing equity and preferred stock. On the other hand, our findings are only partially consistent with financing waves influencing both the issue and repurchase decisions. We find that firms do not issue equity and preferred stock more during periods of economic expansion. They do, however, repurchase more equity and preferred stock during the later years of an economic expansion {{which is consistent with}} the financial wave explanation for repurchases. However, this explanation does not have support for the developed countries without the US, the emerging markets, bank-based countries, and civil law countries.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} political {{attitudes and behaviors}} of individuals residing in communities with large proportions of older adults. These types of locations are growing in number in the United States as the Baby Boomer Generation arrives at retirement age. Many scholars and journalists rely on theories of `senior power' and predict that the places {{with large numbers of}} senior citizens should be especially politically powerful. However, many studies have provided little evidence to support these claims. I explore the old questions with updated data, methods and approaches [...] theorizing that older adults living among their elderly peers will, in fact, exhibit unique levels of political knowledge, efficacy, and participation as well as hold distinct attitudes for safety <b>net</b> <b>issues.</b> Using large-scale surveys and multilevel modeling techniques, I find that older adults residing in aged communities display higher levels of political knowledge than their elderly peers living in places without the same aged context. However, they are less politically efficacious and somewhat less likely to vote. Older adults living among their peers {{are also more likely to}} support social welfare programs, controlling for party identification. I also examine the contextual effect of the aged context for younger residents. In particular, I find that young people are also quite supportive of the safety net policies, which provide assistance for their elder neighbors. Because of this support from the younger generation, older adults in aged communities may rarely, if ever, face threats to their livelihood, driving them into political action. Taken together, the results from this dissertation show that older adults living amongst their peers are certainly equipped for intense political engagement or senior power [...] but they choose political retreatism rather than activism...|$|E

We also find that the generated abnormal returns from hedge strategies that combine information on retained earnings (and on other accrual proxies) or cash distributions to equity holders and value/glamour proxies are significantly higher than those from each proxy alone. Thus, if one agrees that the notion of statistical arbitrage is incompatible with market efficiency our evidence suggests that the anomalies on accruals and <b>net</b> stock <b>issues</b> capture distinct forms of mispricing with the value glamour anomaly.
