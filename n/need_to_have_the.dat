25|$|A {{malthouse}} is {{a building}} in which brewers create malt by starting the germination process of barley or other grains. The malt is then used as a key ingredient {{in the making of}} beer, ale and malt liquor. This malthouse was one of several attempted commercial ventures undertaken by Sir William Keith during his term as governor of Colonial Pennsylvania. His other businesses included a copper mine located west of the Susquehanna River in disputed territory and a foundry on the Christiana River near New Castle, Delaware. The malthouse was constructed during a time of financial complications between Great Britain and her American colonies. Trade was slowed tremendously and supplies of grain were rotting on the idled ships in the colonial ports in cities like Philadelphia. Keith took advantage of the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> grain processed and malting the grain was a good way to preserve it for a time.|$|E
25|$|Suppose a {{listener}} cannot hear a given acoustical signal under silent condition. When a signal is playing while another sound {{is being played}} (a masker) the signal has to be stronger for the listener to hear it. The masker does not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> frequency components of the original signal for masking to happen. A masked signal can be heard {{even though it is}} weaker than the masker. Masking happens when a signal and a masker are played together. It also happens when a masker starts after a signal stops playing. The effects of backward masking is weaker than forward masking. The masking effect has been widely used in psychoacoustical research. With masking you can change the levels of the masker and measure the threshold, then create a diagram of a psychophysical tuning curve that will reveal similar features. Masking effects are also used for audio encoding. The masking effect is used in lossy encoders. It can eliminate some of the weaker sounds, so the listener can not hear the difference. This technique has been used in MP3's.|$|E
25|$|The rabbis {{in ancient}} times insisted on the {{marriage}} couple entering into the ketubah as a protection for the wife. It acted as a replacement of the biblical mohar – the price paid by the groom to the bride, or her parents, for the marriage (i.e., the bride price). The ketubah became a mechanism whereby the amount due to the wife (the bride-price) came to be paid {{in the event of}} the cessation of marriage, either by the death of the husband or divorce. It may be noted that the biblical mohar created a major social problem: many young prospective husbands could not raise the mohar at the time when they would normally be expected to marry. So, to enable these young men to marry, the rabbis, in effect, delayed the time that the amount would be payable, when they {{would be more likely to}} have the sum. The mechanism adopted was to provide for the mohar to be a part of the ketubah. It may also be noted that both the mohar and the ketubah amounts served the same purpose: the protection for the wife should her support (either by death or divorce) cease. The only difference between the two systems was the timing of the payment. A modern secular equivalent would be the entitlement to alimony in the event of divorce. Another function performed by the ketubah amount was to provide a disincentive for the husband contemplating divorcing his wife: he would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> amount to be able to pay to the wife.|$|E

500|$|Amezquita {{had already}} begun working with Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) before he lost the UWA World Featherweight Championship, and became CMLL Exclusive after {{dropping}} the title. in 1992 then-CMLL booker Antonio Peña left CMLL to form his own promotion, Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA); Peña had been the mastermind behind the CMLL Minis division {{and most of the}} Minis in CMLL decided to leave with Peña. Amezquita {{and a number of other}} wrestlers were brought in to replenish the division. Working in the Mini division does not mean that Amezquita has dwarfism, it is not uncommon for very short wrestlers to work in the [...] "Mini" [...] division in Mexico. Ricardo Amezquita was one of the wrestlers brought into CMLL to replenish the division after losing most of their workers and was given the ring persona of Piratita Morgan, a mini version of Pirata Morgan who worked in CMLL at the time and replaced the original Piratita Morgan that had left CMLL to join AAA. In 1994 Pirata Morgan left CMLL to join AAA as well, negating the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> smaller version working in CMLL. Instead he was given the name [...] "Damiancito El Guerrero" [...] after CMLL wrestler [...] "Damian El Guerrero". When he became Damiancito Amezquita began working unmasked.

After returning from Japan he defeated Máscarita Mágica to win the CMLL World Mini-Estrella Championship on February 27, 1996. The storyline between the two Mini-Estrellas later led to Damiancito defeating Mascarita Mágica in a Lucha de Apuestas, or [...] "bet match", where Mascarita Mágica was forced to have all his hair shaved off as a result of losing the match. In late 1997 CMLL booked an eight-man elimination match where the winner would earn the right to tag team with [...] "regular sized" [...] wrestlers. Damiancito El Guerrero defeated Cicloncito Ramírez, Tritoncito, Pequeño Cochisse, Platita, Guerrerito del Future, Pequeño Sayama an Fierito to earn the right to work with [...] "regular sized" [...] wrestlers.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{guarantee}} a fair scheduling, we propose the FIFO-Except scheduling criteria. FIFO-Except {{is based on the}} FIFO (First-In-First-Out) scheduling criteria, i.e., first jobs that come <b>to</b> grid will <b>have</b> higher priority, having its tasks executed first of such jobs that have lower priority. However, sometimes FIFO criteria cannot be placed, because there may be tasks that require resources other than those currently available in the grid. That is, <b>the</b> resource <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> minimum requirements specified by the task {{in order to be able}} to execute it. For example, <b>the</b> resource <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> operational system, an amount of free memory, and disk space specified, among other requirements. Thus, in these cases, such tasks <b>need</b> <b>to</b> wait until resources that meet the its requirements become available. Thus, only in this case, tasks of jobs with lower priority will be executed before those with higher priority. This is why we <b>have</b> named <b>the</b> criteria as FIFO-Except: it behaves like FIFO, except when there are no resources to meet the requirements of the tasks with higher priority. This criteria also allows GridTS to satisfy the starvation-freedom property, which is proven in Sect.  7.5.|$|R
