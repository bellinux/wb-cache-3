500|$|On the {{following}} day, 23 July 1840, the National Assembly formally declared the 14-year-old Pedro II of age. A crowd of 8,000 people gathered {{to witness the}} act. There, in the afternoon, the young emperor took the oath of office. For a second time, Pedro II was acclaimed by the gentry, the Armed Forces and the Brazilian people. [...] "There was <b>not,</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> the panic and weeping of 1831. There was only a young and shy boy divided between the fascination {{of power and the}} fear of a new world which, unexpectedly, was being opened to him." [...] The [...] "declaration of Pedro II's majority aroused a general euphoria. A feeling of release and renewal united Brazilians. For {{the first time since the}} middle of the 1820s the national government at Rio de Janeiro commanded a general acceptance." ...|$|E
500|$|Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone {{said that}} [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] {{features}} Lee [...] "sobbing hysterically over a grand piano". According to the IGN reviewer, Ed Thompson, the song [...] "takes the trademark Evanescence sound - Lee's celestial voice, and adds her brooding lyrics 'I can't change who I am, <b>not</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> I won't lie {{to keep you}} near me and in this short life, there's {{no time to waste}} on giving up. My love wasn't enough'.". Danielle Baudhuin from The Oshkosh West Index noted that [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] was musically similar to [...] "Haunted" [...] from the band's debut studio album Fallen, noting how [...] "creepy background choir vocals and violins send listeners into a gothic Cathedral-like setting". Jim Farber from the Daily News said that [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] will remind older listeners of the 1970s art rock horror band Renaissance. Andree Farias from Christianity Today observed that the song had no connection with the movie Narnia whatsoever classifying it as [...] "just another bitter break-up anthem".|$|E
2500|$|Reverend Jesse Jackson—who, {{prior to}} Obama's {{campaign}}, had come closer {{than any other}} African American to winning a major party's presidential nomination—said that the Obama campaign {{had been on the}} verge of being derailed by racial fear stemming from Wright's comments and previous remarks by Clinton supporter Geraldine Ferraro that Obama would not have come so far had he been white. Jackson said that Obama [...] "made the case we've been here before, but <b>not</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> will we linger. This time we're going to higher ground." ...|$|E

In the Los Angeles Times, he wrote: [...] "Many times in the past, the Israeli peace movement has criticized Israeli military operations. <b>Not</b> <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> This time, the battle is not over Israeli expansion and colonization. There is no Lebanese territory occupied by Israel. There are no territorial claims from either side… The Israeli peace movement should support Israel's attempt at self-defense, pure and simple, as long as this operation targets mostly Hezbollah and spares, as much as possible, the lives of Lebanese civilians.|$|E

Then, {{the faint}} {{whistling}} of another shell dawned, and his blood became small and still to receive it. It drew nearer, like some horrible blast of wind; his blood lost consciousness. But in the second of suspension he saw the heavy shell swoop to earth, into the rocky bushes on the right, and earth and stones poured up into the sky. It {{was as if he}} heard no sound. The earth and stones and fragments of bush fell to earth again, and there was the same unchanging peace. The Germans had got the aim.|$|E
