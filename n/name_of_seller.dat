50|$|These {{documentary}} requirements {{may result in}} two principal issues. Firstly, the stipulation for the buyer to complete the export declaration can {{be an issue in}} certain jurisdictions (not least the European Union) where the customs regulations require the declarant to be either an individual or corporation resident within the jurisdiction. If the buyer is based outside of the customs jurisdiction they will be unable to clear the goods for export, meaning that the goods may be declared in the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the <b>seller</b> by the buyer, even though the export formalities are the buyer's responsibility under the EXW term.|$|R
40|$|Since F. Pringsheim (1950) {{the reading}} of the Greek law of sale has changed. He {{interpreted}} the Greek sale as a cash-contract, where the formalism of the transactions and the difference —though not legal— between possession and ownership are the main elements. This character of the Greek law of sale is confirmed by the epigraphical material. The formal analysis, and also the content’s one, of the Sicilian contracts of Camarina and Morgantina (spanning from IV b. C. to I b. C) compared with that of the contracts of other parts of the Greek world reveal that, despite the absence of juridical complexity, the sale transaction is a very formalized and unified one throughout the Greek world, at least since the fourth century b. C., with a tradition which is probably much older. The structure of these contracts is the following: invocation to the gods or Tyche; date; <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>seller</b> and purchaser; verb which defines the kind of transaction; object to be acquired, with the elements which define and specify it; price; in case of πρᾶσις ἐπὶ λύσει, term within which the λύσις must be effected; guarantor and/or witnesses. The existence of the πρᾶσις ἐπὶ λύσει and of witnesses {{to be added to the}} written contract even in the latest epigraphical sources confirms the need for formalism and the absence of a complex law, that could cover contracts with the possibility of deferred payment...|$|R
40|$|Can {{the mere}} <b>name</b> <b>of</b> a <b>seller</b> {{determine}} his trustworthiness {{in the eye}} of the consumer? In 10 studies (total N = 608) we explored username complexity and trustworthiness <b>of</b> eBay <b>seller</b> profiles. <b>Name</b> complexity was manipulated through variations in username pronounceability and length. These dimensions had strong, independent effects on trustworthiness, with sellers with easy-to-pronounce or short usernames being rated as more trustworthy than sellers with difficult-to-pronounce or long usernames, respectively. Both effects were repeatedly found even when objective information about seller reputation was available. We hypothesized the effect <b>of</b> <b>name</b> complexity on trustworthiness to be based on the experience of high vs. low processing fluency, with little awareness of the underlying process. Supporting this, participants could not correct for the impact of username complexity when explicitly asked to do so. Three alternative explanations based on attributions of the variations in name complexity to seller origin (ingroup vs. outgroup), username generation method (seller personal choice vs. computer algorithm) and age of the eBay profiles (10 years vs. 1 year) were tested and ruled out. Finally, we show that manipulating the ease of reading product descriptions instead <b>of</b> the sellers’ <b>names</b> also impacts the trust ascribed to the sellers...|$|R

60|$|It is a {{world of}} surprises. They fall, too, where one is least expecting them. When I {{introduced}} Sellers into the book, Charles Dudley Warner, who was writing the story with me, proposed a change <b>of</b> <b>Seller's</b> Christian <b>name.</b> Ten years before, in a remote corner of the West, he had come across a man named Eschol Sellers, and he thought that Eschol was just the right and fitting name for our Sellers, since it was odd and quaint and all that. I liked the idea, but I said that that man might turn up and object. But Warner said it couldn't happen; that he was doubtless dead by this time, a man with a name like that couldn't live long; and be he dead or alive we must have the name, it was exactly the right one and we couldn't do without it. So the change was made. Warner's man was a farmer in a cheap and humble way. When the book had been out a week, a college-bred gentleman of courtly manners and ducal upholstery arrived in Hartford in a sultry state of mind and with a libel suit in his eye, and his name was Eschol Sellers! He had never heard of the other one, and had never been within a thousand miles of him. This damaged aristocrat's programme was quite definite and businesslike: the American Publishing Company must suppress the edition as far as printed, and change the name in the plates, or stand a suit for $10,000. He carried away the Company's promise and many apologies, and we changed the name back to Colonel Mulberry Sellers, in the plates. Apparently there is nothing that cannot happen. Even the existence of two unrelated men wearing the impossible <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Eschol <b>Sellers</b> is a possible thing.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} model for buying agents in e-marketplaces to {{interpret}} evaluations <b>of</b> <b>sellers</b> provided by other buying agents, known as advisors. The interpretation <b>of</b> <b>seller</b> evaluations {{is complicated by the}} inherent subjectivity of each advisor, the possibility that advisors may deliberately provide misleading evaluations to deceive competitors and the dynamic nature <b>of</b> <b>seller</b> and advisor behaviours that may naturally change seller evaluations over time. Using a Bayesian approach, we demonstrate how to cope with subjectivity, deception and change in a principled way. More specifically, by modeling seller properties and advisor evaluation functions as dynamic random variables, buyers can progressively learn a probabilistic model that naturally and "correctly" calibrates the interpretation <b>of</b> <b>seller</b> evaluations without having to resort to heuristics to explicitely detect and filter/discount unreliable seller evaluations. Our model, called BLADE, is shown empirically to achieve lower mean error in the estimation <b>of</b> <b>seller</b> properties when compared to other models for reasoning about advisor ratings <b>of</b> <b>sellers</b> in electronic maketplaces...|$|R

5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 17th century the Grand Bazaar had already achieved its final shape. The enormous extent of the Ottoman Empire in three continents, and the total control of road communications between Asia and Europe, rendered the Bazaar and the surrounding hans or caravanserais the hub of the Mediterranean trade. According to several European travellers, at that time, and until {{the first half of the}} 19th century, the market was unrivalled in Europe with regards to the abundance, variety and quality of the goods on sale. At that time we know from European travellers that the Grand Bazaar had a square plan, with two perpendicular main roads crossing in the middle and a third road running along the outer perimeter. In the Bazaar there were 67 roads (each bearing the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sellers</b> <b>of</b> a particular good), several squares used for the daily prayers, 5 mosques, 7 fountains, 18 gates which were opened each day in the morning and closed in the evening (from these comes the modern <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the Market, [...] "Closed Market" [...] (...) [...] Around 1638 the Turkish traveller Evliya Çelebi gave us the most important historical description of the Bazaar and of its customs. The number of shops amounted to 3,000, plus 300 located in the surrounding hans, large caravanserais with two or three storeys round a porticoed inner courtyard, where goods could be stored and merchants could be lodged. In that period one tenth of the shops of the city were concentrated in the market and around it. For all that, at that time the market was not yet covered.Recurrent calamities, fires and earthquakes hit the Grand Bazaar. The first fire occurred in 1515; another in 1548. Other fires ravaged the complex in 1588, 1618 (when the [...] was destroyed), 1645, 1652, 1658, 1660 (on that occasion the whole city was devastated), 1687, 1688 (great damage occurred to the [...] ) 1695, 1701. [...] The fire of 1701 was particularly fierce, forcing in 1730-31 Grand Vizier Nevşehirli Damad Ibrahim Pasha to rebuild several parts of the complex. In 1738 the Kizlar Aĝasi Beşir Ağa endowed the Fountain (still existing) near Mercan Kapi.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} {{the value of}} decentralized models <b>of</b> <b>sellers</b> in electronic marketplaces, {{as the basis for}} purchasing decisions from buyers. We discuss how buying agents can model the reputation <b>of</b> <b>sellers</b> in order to make effective purchases and how these agents can also take advantage of reputation ratings provided by other buying agents in the marketplace, once it is established that each buyer will be independently modelling the sellers. We outline the methods required to make use of reputation ratings <b>of</b> <b>sellers</b> provided by other buyers, including adjustments for possibly different subjective scales and for possible deception in reporting the reputation ratings. In particular, we propose that buying agents model the reputation not only <b>of</b> <b>sellers</b> but <b>of</b> advisors, as part of the overall processing. We describe as well how buyers can most effectively model the set of possible buying advisors in order to apply selective processing of the information provided by these agents, in their purchasing decisions...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the equilibrium choice of selling mechanisms by competing firms. For a model where a number <b>of</b> <b>sellers</b> choose sequentially between any two selling mechanisms, {{there is a}} unique (subgame perfect) equilibrium under fairly natural assumptions about the monotonicity and differences of the two mechanisms. All sellers choose the mechanism that has the higher per-seller surplus at a critical mass number <b>of</b> <b>sellers.</b> If a mechanism is efficient or is favored by the buyer in some "strong" sense, it will be selected as the equilibrium mechanism. Otherwise, the less efficient mechanism can emerge in equilibrium, even when the number <b>of</b> <b>sellers</b> is arbitrarily large. An {{increase in the number}} <b>of</b> <b>sellers</b> need not increase the buyer's surplus, and can sometimes lead to a less e¡Àcient equilibrium mechanism. When more than two selling mechanisms are available, however, the equilibrium may no long be unique; and there are usually multiple equilibria when sellers choose selling mechanisms simultaneously.

40|$|Two-sided {{exchange}} networks (such as eBay) often advertise {{their number}} of users, pre-sumably to encourage further participation. However, these networks differ markedly {{on how they}} advertise their user base. Some highlight the number <b>of</b> <b>sellers,</b> some empha-size the number of buyers, and others disclose both. We use field experiment data from a business-to-business web site to examine the efficacy of these different display formats. Before each potential seller posted a listing, the web site randomized whether to display the number <b>of</b> buyers and/or <b>sellers,</b> and if so how many buyers and/or sellers to claim. We find that when information about both buyers and sellers is displayed, a large number <b>of</b> <b>sellers</b> deters further seller listings. However, this deterrence effect disappears when only the number <b>of</b> <b>sellers</b> is presented. Similarly, {{a large number of}} buyers is more likely to attract new listings when it is displayed together with the number <b>of</b> <b>sellers.</b> These results suggest the presence of indirect network externalities, whereby a seller prefers markets with many other sellers because they help attract more buyers...|$|R
