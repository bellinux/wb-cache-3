30|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Pudong (Shanghai), Binhai (Tianjin), and Liangjiang (Chongqing) <b>new</b> <b>areas,</b> 13 additional state-level <b>new</b> <b>areas</b> were approved by the State Council in the 12 th Five-Year Plan. A total of 16 state-level <b>new</b> <b>areas</b> in mideastern, midwestern, and northeastern China have been established. With the coverage of state-level <b>new</b> <b>areas</b> shifting from cities with national strategic importance to regional growth poles, more areas are expected to be approved in the future. The Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Healthy Development of State-Level <b>New</b> <b>Areas</b> [11] issued by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and other departments specifies that “the <b>new</b> <b>areas</b> will be developed into important windows for the all-round expansion and opening-up, to become major platforms for institutional and systematic innovations, forming crucial poles of growth in regions playing radiating and leading roles, and becoming the areas of demonstration for city-industry integrated development.” The construction of superior state-level <b>new</b> <b>areas</b> requires the support of a superior intraregional transportation network. Since state-level <b>new</b> <b>areas</b> are usually large (ranging from hundreds of square kilometers to more than two thousand square kilometers), with different functional zones distributed within the area, they tend to have specific demands for the intraregional transportation. Electric light rail is likely to become the main mode of urban rail transit.|$|R

5|$|A {{railroad}} {{was being}} built {{and the population}} of Quorn hoped that it would go through the village {{on its way to}} Sioux City, Iowa. However, the railroad did not go through Quorn. One of the many ideas about why the railroad took a different route was due to a disagreement between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Close brothers. The actual reason is still unknown. Due to the railroad being the main mode of transportation of goods, the villagers {{had no choice but to}} relocate to a <b>new</b> <b>area.</b> Every business except for a mill was moved to a <b>new</b> <b>area</b> during 1883.|$|E

In the meantime, the 85th Battalion had completed reorganizing at Inshas Base and returned to Ismailia, where it was placed under Azmy's command once again. The 129th Sa'iqa Group retreated to Abu Suweir, north of Ismailia, to reorganize, and Heikal was also informed of his group's <b>new</b> <b>area</b> of operations, {{with the objective of}} defending the Upper Bridge, and the crucial Cairo-Ismailia Desert Road that incorporated the bridge.|$|E
5|$|An area of low {{pressure}} tracked across southeastern Canada during the 12th, which brought an arctic front across the Mid Atlantic region {{late on the}} 12th. As this occurred, a strong area of high pressure located across central Canada built down into the Northeast, allowing very cold air to spill southward ultimately leading to what is known as cold air damming. This occurs east of the mountains down through the Mid Atlantic states. Meanwhile, a Pacific storm slammed onto the California coast during the 11th and as it moved eastward, a <b>new</b> <b>area</b> of {{low pressure}} developed across southeastern Colorado and the Texas Panhandle.|$|E
5|$|Aphids {{and other}} hemipteran insects secrete a sweet liquid called {{honeydew}}, when they feed on plant sap. The sugars in honeydew are a high-energy food source, which many ant species collect. In some cases, the aphids secrete the honeydew {{in response to}} ants tapping them with their antennae. The ants in turn keep predators away from the aphids and will move them from one feeding location to another. When migrating to a <b>new</b> <b>area,</b> many colonies will take the aphids with them, to ensure a continued supply of honeydew. Ants also tend mealybugs to harvest their honeydew. Mealybugs may become a serious pest of pineapples if ants are present to protect mealybugs from their natural enemies.|$|E

50|$|Plants in {{a garden}} or {{maintained}} landscape often form a source population from which plants can colonize <b>new</b> <b>areas.</b> Avoiding the use of invasive species helps to prevent such plants from establishing new populations.

5|$|Cane toads pose {{a serious}} threat to native species when {{introduced}} to a new ecosystem. Classified as an invasive species in over 20 countries, there are multiple reports of the cane toad moving into a <b>new</b> <b>area</b> to be followed by a decline in the biodiversity in that region. The most documented region of the cane toad's invasion and subsequent effect on native species is Australia, where multiple surveys and observations of the toad's conquest have been completed. The best way to illustrate this effect is through the plight of the northern quoll, as well as Mertens' water monitor, a large lizard native to South and Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Central Area was disbanded in August 1941 and its {{responsibilities}} divided between Southern Area, Northern Area, {{and the newly}} formed No.2 (Training) Group. The outbreak of the Pacific War resulted in Northern Area being split in January 1942 into North-Western and North-Eastern Areas, to counter separate Japanese threats to Northern Australia and New Guinea. Southern Area was also considered appropriate for division owing to its size, so the Australian Air Board proposed assigning responsibility for operational and maintenance units within New South Wales to a <b>new</b> <b>area</b> command, Eastern Area, which would also assume control of units in southern Queensland from North-Eastern Area.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} {{period of the}} Ukrainian SSR, Odessa Governorate was formed out of parts of the former Kherson Governorate.

The 1932–33 Holodomor famine had a {{profound}} demographic effect on the region. Its population declined by 15–20%. About a decade later, the Nazi occupation of Ukraine during the Second World War had a devastating impact on the region's previously large Jewish population. Also during the war, the ethnically-diverse Budjak was annexed to the Ukrainian SSR as Izmail Oblast. It was merged into Odessa Oblast in 1954.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Hurricane Iris was {{forecast}} {{to remain}} a tropical cyclone while crossing Central America and to re-intensify in the eastern Pacific Ocean; had it done so, it would have retained the name Iris. Instead, the hurricane rapidly weakened after moving into the mountainous terrain of Guatemala, and within six hours of landfall the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm. Late on October9, within sixteen hours of landfall, the circulation dissipated over extreme southeastern Mexico. As the remnants approached the Pacific Ocean, a <b>new</b> <b>area</b> of convection developed south of the original circulation of Iris. It gradually organized while continuing westward, developing into Tropical Storm Manuel; the new storm ultimately lasted until October18 before succumbing to cooler waters and wind shear.|$|E
5|$|On May20, {{following}} Typhoon Brenda's {{passage through}} the South China Sea, a monsoon trough extending from the area into the Bay of Bengal received enhanced low-level southwesterly flow. An environment of weak wind shear {{in the wake of}} the typhoon allowed a <b>new</b> <b>area</b> of low pressure to form within the southwesterly flow on May21. With convection becoming persistent and the system's overall presentation more organized by May22, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 0300UTC. Around this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression. Later that day, convection wrapped entirely around the center of circulation; this structural improvement, combined with nearby surface observations, prompted the JTWC to designate the system as Tropical Storm Cecil.|$|E
5|$|On September 13, {{despite being}} in an {{extremely}} hostile environment with very high wind shear, convection redeveloped {{near the center of}} Fred, and regeneration into a tropical cyclone was seen as a possibility. Two days later, the NHC noted that environmental conditions could become marginally favorable for redevelopment of the system. On September16, the circulation of Fred became less defined and only intermittent convection persisted around the system. By September17, the remnant circulation became increasingly disorganized and the system dissipated later that day without regenerating into a tropical cyclone. However, several hours later, a <b>new</b> <b>area</b> of low pressure formed in association with the remnants of Fred roughly 525mi (845km) south of Bermuda. The remnant low finally dissipated on September19, roughly 520mi (835km) southwest of Bermuda.|$|E
