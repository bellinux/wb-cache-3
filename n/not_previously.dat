5|$|A rural {{municipality}} in Nova Scotia provides local government for rural areas outside of incorporated towns. Rural municipalities {{were established in}} 1879 and are inclusive of county municipalities and district municipalities. District municipalities are within historical counties that were previously subdivided into districts, whereas county municipalities are within historical counties that were <b>not</b> <b>previously</b> subdivided into districts.|$|E
5|$|Discovered in 1995, the Pyxis {{globular}} cluster is a 13.3 ± 1.3 billion year-old {{globular cluster}} situated around 130,000 light-years distant from Earth and around 133,000 light-years {{distant from the}} centre of the Milky Way—a region <b>not</b> <b>previously</b> thought to contain globular clusters. Located in the galactic halo, it was noted to lie on the same plane as the Large Magellanic Cloud and the possibility has been raised that it might be an escaped object from that galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Guam-born then 24-year-old judoka Silulu A'etonu was {{the only}} American Samoan {{participating}} in a judo event at the Beijing Olympics. She had <b>not</b> <b>previously</b> participated in any Olympic games. The judoka represented American Samoa in the women's half-middleweight weight class (which includes competitors under 63kilograms in weight). During the August 12 Round of 32 (the first round), Aetonu faced Germany's Anna von Harnier. von Harnier defeated A`etonu by a kuchiki taoshi, scoring ippon. She did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|Justinian {{achieved}} lasting fame {{through his}} judicial reforms, particularly through the complete revision of all Roman law, {{something that had}} <b>not</b> <b>previously</b> been attempted. The total of Justinian's legislature is known today as the Corpus juris civilis. It consists of the Codex Iustinianus, the Digesta or Pandectae, the Institutiones, and the Novellae.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{allegations}} had <b>not</b> <b>previously</b> been reported to authorities, the reasons given included fear of disbelief and distrust in the judicial system. At least seven allegations of sexual assault made to police during Savile's lifetime were not linked by police, with Savile as the same alleged perpetrator. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said that {{the allegations}} made to Surrey Police between 2007 and 2009 could have resulted in prosecutions being undertaken.|$|E

5|$|Rowland (2009) {{identified}} {{an additional}} mechanism of countershading <b>not</b> <b>previously</b> analysed, namely that a round {{body like a}} cylinder illuminated and seen from above appears to have dark sides. Using a graphics tool, she demonstrated that this effect can be flattened out by countershading. Since predators are known to use edges to identify prey, countershading may therefore, she argues, make prey harder to detect when seen from above.|$|E
5|$|Soul Reaver 2 was {{composed}} by Kurt Harland, of American band Information Society, and Jim Hedges. Harland and Hedges had already collaborated on Soul Reaver, but Hedges had <b>not</b> <b>previously</b> contributed compositions. The adaptive audio framework {{from the previous}} game returned; depending on signals from the game in certain situations—such as combat, puzzles, danger or suspense—the game's soundtrack actively changes. Music from both Soul Reaver and Soul Reaver 2 was released on a promotional soundtrack in 2001.|$|E

5|$|The Naming Committee was {{established}} in 1991 to determine whether new given names <b>not</b> <b>previously</b> used in Iceland are suitable for integration into the country's language and culture. The committee comprises three appointees who serve for four years, appointed by the Minister of Justice—one to be nominated by the Icelandic Language Committee, one by the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Iceland, and one by the university's Faculty of Law.|$|E
5|$|The Seminole Wars {{increased}} the U.S. {{military presence in}} the Everglades, which resulted in the exploration and mapping of many regions that had <b>not</b> <b>previously</b> been recorded. The military officers who had done the mapping and charting of the Everglades were approached by Thomas Buckingham Smith in 1848 to consult on the feasibility of draining the region for agricultural use.|$|E

5|$|The three ironclad ships {{selected}} differed {{substantially in}} design and degree of risk. Monitor was the most innovative design {{by virtue of its}} low freeboard, shallow-draft iron hull, and total dependence on steam power. The riskiest element of its design was its rotating gun turret, something that had <b>not</b> <b>previously</b> been tested by any navy. Ericsson's guarantee of delivery in 100 days proved to be decisive in choosing his design despite the risk involved.|$|E
5|$|A {{fleet of}} 40 AEC Routemaster buses were {{purchased}} from London Transport in 1986 {{to launch the}} new services in competition with Strathclyde Buses. Kelvin had <b>not</b> <b>previously</b> employed conductors, but introduced them for these services. This meant the vehicles {{did not have to}} spend as long loading at bus stops as one-person operated buses and were able to offer quicker journeys through Glasgow. The Routemasters proved popular with both passengers and staff and continued to operate into the 1990s under successor company Kelvin Central, {{which was one of the}} last operators of the type in regular service in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Abderramán Brenes la Roche also competed as a judoka on Puerto Rico's behalf.

Brenes had <b>not</b> <b>previously</b> competed in any Olympic games. During the August 12 first round (or Round of 32), the judoka faced Italy's Giuseppe Maddaloni in the sixteenth match Maddaloni defeated the Puerto Rican athlete with a morote gari, scoring yuko.
