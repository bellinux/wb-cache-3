40|$|The human {{granulocyte}} colony stimulating factor (hG-CSF) {{plays an}} important role in hematopoietic cell proliferation/differentiation and has been widely used as a therapeutic agent for treating neutropenias. <b>Nartograstim</b> is a commercial G-CSF that presents amino acid changes in specific positions when compared to the wildtype form, which potentially increase its activity and stability. The aim of this work was to develop an expression system in Escherichia coli that leads to the production of large amounts of a recombinant hG-CSF (rhG-CSF) biosimilar to <b>Nartograstim.</b> The nucleotide sequence of hg-csf was codon-optimized for expression in E. coli. As a result, high yields of the recombinant protein were obtained with adequate purity, structural integrity and biological activity. This protein has also been successfully used for the production of specific polyclonal antibodies in mice, which could be used in the control of the expression and purification in an industrial production process of this recombinant protein. These results will allow the planning of large-scale production of this mutant version of hG-CSF (<b>Nartograstim),</b> as a potential new biosimilar in the market.

40|$|An rhG-CSF derivative, <b>nartograstim</b> (NTG), at {{dose levels}} of 0 (saline), 0. 1, 1, 10, and 100 mg/kg, was {{administered}} subcutane-ously {{to groups of}} 3 male and 3 female cynomolgus monkeys once daily for 26 weeks to investigate its toxicity. In Week 4 or later, an increase in leukocyte counts consisting mainly of neutrophils was noted in all NTG dose groups, and {{was considered to be}} attribut-able to the pharmacological action of NTG. The degree of this increase was reduced with repetition of dosing. Increases in gran-ulocytic cells and granulocytic cells/erythrocytic cells (G/E) ratio in the bone marrow, increase in serum ALP activity, and enlarged spleens with increase of neutrophils in the red pulp were observed at 10 mg/kg and higher. Anemia was noted at 10 mg/kg and higher in Week 4 and was accompanied by an increase in reticulocytes and a decrease in total cholesterol level at 100 mg/kg. Anti-NTG antibody was detected in 1 female at 100 mg/kg, but neutralizin...|$|E
