5|$|Law enforcement's corrupt {{attitude}} generally was <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> of the people. Apart {{from the}} economic benefits provided by the Maceos, these bosses provided {{a high degree of}} protection to the island's citizens. When serious crimes were committed the local police would sometimes contact the Maceos to have the matter dealt with. However, the island was not completely peaceful; threats at the point of a gun were a common means for the Maceo gang to ensure control. Though the average citizen was relatively safe, gangland slayings of potential rivals did take place on occasion.|$|E

25|$|In the {{integrative}} approach, {{unlike the}} distributive approach, parties seek {{to find an}} arrangement {{that is in the}} best interest of both sides.

25|$|Rogers {{described}} {{the concepts of}} congruence and incongruence as important ideas in his theory. In proposition #6, he refers to the actualizing tendency. At the same time, he recognized the need for positive regard. In a fully congruent person realizing their potential is <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> of experiencing positive regard. They are able to lead lives that are authentic and genuine. Incongruent individuals, {{in their pursuit of}} positive regard, lead lives that include falseness and do not realize their potential. Conditions put on them by those around them make it necessary for them to forgo their genuine, authentic lives to meet with the approval of others. They live lives that are not true to themselves, to who they are on the inside out.|$|E
25|$|Four {{thousand}} {{years in the}} future, Human civilization has met its first full antagonist — the Green Exarchy. A system of many civilizations ruled by a non-human emperor, the Green Exarch, represents a significant threat to High Earth. The Green Exarch has at his employ the extremely dangerous shapeshifting (protean) agents known as Vombis. The Dirac is still in common use. High Earth remains the center of Human civilization. That civilization is remarkably advanced — for all practical intents, humans are now immortal. A memory cleanse known as Baptism permits those filled with ennui to begin lives anew, though there are side effects from subconscious recall. A quasi-religious group known as Sagittarians also play a part. The most important financial force in the empire of High Earth is the Traitor's Guild, who permit money to flow from system to system in reward of treachery to system governments, producing a Feudatory system between worlds, though <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> of internal stability. Traitors skilfully employ advanced biotechnology to further their aims, and are known to employ fungal cytotoxins, DNA reverse transcription mutation agents (to inject false memories and appearances in order to forestall recognition and testimony during interrogations), as well as technology to petrify dead bodies {{in order to make}} up wall fortifications in far offworld planets. The Traitors Guild may be found on all planets (A Traitor of Quality, Section in The Quincunx of Time with a lecture about the Traitor's Guild, and The Green Exarchy).|$|E

500|$|For {{the main}} female {{character}} in the book, Faulks created Scarlett Papava, a fellow MI6 agent who is promoted to the 00 section {{at the end of}} the novel. Academic Tony Garland draws a similarity between Papava and the John Gardner character Fredericka von Grüsse, as they both create [...] "a tension between mission and desire." [...] Faulks himself considered that: [...] "My female lead—the 'Bond girl'—has a little more depth than Fleming's women, but <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> of glamour", although Christopher Hitchens complained that [...] "there is almost no sex until the very last pages." ...|$|E
500|$|Humor {{plays an}} {{important}} role in No One Lives Forever. As Hubbard explained, the game's intention is [...] "to make you laugh, but <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> of providing a broader, more satisfying emotional experience than a spoof generally allows, so that even if you don't chuckle once, you can still have plenty of fun playing the game. At heart, NOLF is an action/adventure/espionage game with a healthy dose of levity." [...] Humor is presented mainly via visual gags, overheard conversations, textual intelligence items, and cutscenes. The humor includes [...] "situational humor, and even a dash of absurdity and bathroom humor for good measure. Some of it is subtle, some of it isn't." [...] The name of UNITY, H.A.R.M., and other fictional organizations mentioned in the game follow the spy genre formula of using contrived acronyms for organizations (see List of fictional espionage organizations). What H.A.R.M. actually stands for is never revealed, and speculation about its true meaning is used as a running gag in the game and its sequel.|$|E

2500|$|There {{exists a}} minor rift in the {{community}} of environmental journalists. [...] Some, including those in the Society of Environmental Journalists, believe in objectively reporting environmental news, while others, like Michael Frome, a prominent figure in the field, believe that journalists should only enter the environmental side of the field if saving the planet is a personal passion, and that environmental journalists should not shy away from environmental advocacy, though <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> of clearly relating facts and opinions on all sides of an issue. [...] This debate {{is not likely to be}} settled soon, but with changes in the field of journalism filtering up from new media being used by the general public to produce news, it seems likely that the field of environmental journalism will lend itself more and more toward reporting points of view akin to environmental advocacy.|$|E
2500|$|Just as in {{the works}} of Metzinger, and unlike those of Pablo Picasso or Georges Braque of the same period, Gleizes had no {{interest}} in the flattening of the entire surface, of fusing background and foreground to the point where all spatial depth of field was abandoned. Yet Gleizes made use of fragmentation of form, multiple perspective views (i.e., mobile and dynamic, rather than static and from one point-of-view) along with linear and planar structural qualities. Gleizes' Les Baigneuses (The Bathers) of the following year employs the same concept of multiple perspective, but <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> of vacating spatial depth. Though highly sophisticated in theory, this aspect of simultaneity would actually become quite commonly employed within the practices of the Section d'Or group. Gleizes deployed these techniques in [...] "a radical, personal and coherent manner" [...] (Cottington, 1998).|$|E
