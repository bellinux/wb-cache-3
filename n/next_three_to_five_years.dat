25|$|Following {{injury to}} the central nervous system, NG2 expressing {{oligodendrocyte}} precursor cells are seen around the site of injury within 48 hours of the initial injury. The number of NG2 expressing cells continues to increase for the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> days {{and high levels of}} NG2 are seen within seven–ten days of the injury. In vitro studies have been done to demonstrate the effect that NG2 levels play on neurite growth inhibition. Notably, neurons would not adhere to substrates made solely of NG2, which hints at its inhibitory effects on nerve regeneration. When grown on substrates containing both NG2 and adhesive molecules, neurite extension was shown to be reduced by 40-45% when compared to neurite extension on substrates only containing the adhesive molecules. Furthermore, cultures were created with striped surfaces that alternated NG2 lanes with lanes only containing adhesive molecules. Neurons and axons placed on these striped regions consistently stayed in the lanes without NG2. It is clear, then, that the accumulation of NG2 expressing cells at the site of injury creates an extracellular barrier that inhibits axon regrowth into the glial scar area.|$|R

Because of suitability to local climatic conditions, mainly domestic cultivars and cultivars originating in neighbouring countries are grown. The planting material of pome fruits produced and used for establishment of new orchards in Latvia corresponds to the Conformitas Agraria Communitatis standard due to the unavailability of nuclear stock. To establish virus-tested, experimental nuclear stock for apple and pear, one to two years old candidate plants were exposed to thermotherapy at + 38 °C for 40 to 70 days. The mother trees and candidate plants before treatment were tested for the presence of the four most widespread pome fruit viruses by RT-PCR. The shoot tips of the heat-treated plants were grafted onto seedling rootstocks and were re-tested for the four viruses by RT-PCR during the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> vegetation seasons. Several plants of apple cultivars ‘Dace’, ‘Zarja Alatau’, ‘Rubin’, and ‘Ausma’ remained infected either with Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus, Apple stem growing virus or Apple stem pitting virus after the thermotherapy.

40|$|Raw meat-based diets {{have gained}} {{popularity}} {{in recent years}} amongst dog owners {{and there is a}} lot of debate about the effects of raw food on dogs' health. The purpose of this thesis was to study serum mineral concentrations in dogs eating raw meat-based diet or dry diet. The minerals analyzed were copper, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and zinc. My hypothesis is that when dogs are fed industrial balanced raw or dry food there are no significant differences in the serum mineral concentrations between the two diet groups. In this study there were 41 adult Staffordshire bull terriers of which 25 ate raw food and 16 dry food. 26 of the dogs were atopic, 13 were control dogs and 2 dogs could not be placed to either of the groups. The dogs came <b>to</b> <b>three</b> visits. The first blood sample was taken on either the first or the baseline visit. During the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> months the dogs were either on dry food or raw food diet, based on allotment. Itching, skin symptoms, and diet were taken into consideration in the allotment. After the feeding study the dogs came to the end visit where the second blood sample was taken. Based on the results both diets had an effect on some mineral concentrations. Also the health status had an effect on some mineral concentrations and in the atopic dogs the diet had a more pronounced effect on the serum mineral concentrations than in the control dogs. On the basis of these results the hypothesis was incorrect because there were significant differences in the serum mineral concentrations between the two diets. As we do not know the optimal serum concentrations of these minerals in the canine species the clinical significance of these results is somewhat limited but this study lays the foundation for further studies...|$|R

40|$|Notwithstanding {{the rosy}} {{short-term}} fiscal scenarios being advanced in Washington, the demographic transition presents the United States {{with a very}} serious fiscal crisis. In 30 years there will be {{twice the number of}} elderly, but only 15 percent more workers to help pay Social Security and Medicare benefits. A realistic reading of the government demographic projections suggests a two thirds increase in payroll tax rates over the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> decades. However, these forecasts ignore macroeconomic feedback effects. In particular, they ignore the possibility that the nation will have more capital per worker as the number of elderly wealth-holders rises relative to the number of young workers. More capital per worker would mean higher worker productivity, higher real wages, and the lower return to capital that worries Wall Street. It would also mean a bigger payroll tax base and a smaller rise in tax rates. On the other hand, a higher payroll tax will leave workers with less after-tax income out of which to save and, therefore, fewer retirement assets than would otherwise be the case. Thus capital deepening is not a foregone conclusion. This study develops a dynamic general equilibrium life-cycle simulation model to study these conflicting forces. The model is {{the first of its kind}} to admit realistic patterns of fertility and lifespan extension. It also features heterogeneity, within as well as across generations, and, thus, can be used to study both intra- and intergenerational equity. Unfortunately, our baseline demographic simulation, which assumes the continuation of current social security policy, shows deteriorating macroeconomic conditions that will exacerbate, rather than mitigate, our fiscal problems. Real wages per effective unit of labor fall 4 percent over the next 30 years and 10 percent over the century. For Wall Street, this bad news about real wages is good news about the real return on capital, which rises 100 basis points by 2030 and 300 basis points by 2100. The model's gradual capital shallowing reflects the concomitant major rise in tax rates. In 2030, payroll tax rates and average income-tax rates applied to wages are 77 and 9 percent higher, respectively, than in 2000. Together, these tax hikes raise...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-lasting}} {{minimum of}} Solar Cycle 23 {{as well as}} the overall weak maximum of Cycle 24, reveal the possibility for a return to Grand Solar Minimum conditions within the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> decades. The past millennium featured at least 5 excursions (lasting 60 – 100 years) of exceptionally low solar activity, induced by a weak magnetic field of the Sun. The last Grand Solar Minimum, the so called Maunder Minimum (1645 – 1715), coincides with the ’Little Ice Age’ in Europe, a time of severe cold, especially during winter season. The quantification of the implications of such a projected decrease in solar forcing is of ultimate importance, given the on-going public discussion of the role of carbon dioxide emissions for global warming, and the possible role a cooling due to decreasing solar activity could be ascribed to. Since the magnitude of a future reduction in solar forcing, due to a possible Grand Solar Minimum, is highly uncertain, 3 different solar reconstruction datasets for the Maunder Minimum period that show significant differences in both, TSI (total solar irradiance) and SSI (solar spectral irradiance), were used to simulate a future Grand Solar Minimum under RCP 6. 0 conditions. All transient simulations were carried out using the ocean-coupled chemistry-climate model EMAC-O. Besides interactive ozone chemistry and a high model top (0. 01 hPa) the model includes a high-resolution shortwave radiation scheme. The results obtained, suggest a certain slowdown of global-scale temperature increase mainly during the core period of a future Grand Solar Minimum. However, some regions show a rather strong response to Grand Solar Minimum conditions. These include the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, but also vast areas of the inner tropics. Furthermore it shows, that a Grand Solar Minimum might be associated with a modulation of the ENSO amplitude which faces less amplification during the 21 st century under reduced solar forcing compared to the reference simulation. In the middle atmospere a Grand Solar Minimum might reinforce the expected cooling due to rising greenhouse gas emissions. This additional cooling can be attributed to reduced short wave radiation during a Grand Solar Minimum, less ozone production and an associated decrease in short wave heating rates. It also can be shown that a Grand Solar Minimum interferes with a recovery of total column ozone, which is markedly delayed under the influence of a Grand Solar Minimum. Conclusively, a distinct influence on middle atmosphere dynamics in Northern Hemisphere winter was found under Grand Solar Minimum conditions. These solar induced changes are characterized by a weakening of the polar vortex, more frequent sudden stratospheric warmings in early winter and a top-down modulation of tropospheric winter variability...|$|R
