50|$|Work is {{underway}} {{to develop a}} s closed-cycle gas turbine to operate at temperatures near 550 °C. This would have implications for bulk thermal and <b>nuclear</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity,</b> because the supercritical properties of carbon dioxide at above 500 °C and 20 MPa enable thermal efficiencies approaching 45 percent. This could increase the electrical power produced per unit of fuel required by 40 percent or more. Given the volume of carbon fuels used in producing electricity, {{the environmental impact of}} cycle efficiency increases would be significant.|$|E
40|$|This lesson {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} the outlook for energy independence between the United States and France. Topics include the average per capita energy usage between the two countries, differences in types of energy usage, and the strong reliance by the French on <b>nuclear</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity.</b> There is also a discussion of the future of nuclear power in France, as environmental and economic considerations preclude the construction of any new nuclear power plants. The lesson includes an activity in which students monitor the electrical usage of key appliances in their homes, and compare how their actions affect the amount of emissions released. They will record the power ratings and weekly usages of each appliance, and use an online calculator to compute the amounts of CO 2, NO 2, and NOx emitted.

40|$|Electricity {{consumption}} is increasing within the European Union (EU) {{and at the}} current rate the level of dependency on imported energy resources to meet demand will rise to 70 % by 2020 (CEC 2001). During the 1990 s assessments of the viability of <b>nuclear</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> were made {{against a background of}} lower and more stable energy prices, especially for oil. Governments were able to allow electorates to exercise their choice for a nuclear free energy policy, as cheaper alternatives were available. This is no longer the case. The beginning of the 21 st century has been characterised by the rapidly fluctuating prices of alternative energy resources. As costs of energy have risen, the urgency of completing the single market in electricity has become more apparent. For the first time for many years some EU member states are viewing the nuclear option more favourably. Finland has commissioned a new nuclear power plant. Whilst nuclear energy is considered undesirable from the ethical perspective of some consumers, the openness of the European market makes its presence inevitable. As the market for electricity within the European Union becomes more integrated, the choice for those Member States and EU citizens who desire the phase out of the use of the nuclear technologies everywhere is disappearing. The focus is now on the infrastructure to transfer that electricity around the EU. Here is the dilemma, how do you provide nuclear free electricity for those who want it on the transmission lines and electricity grids of the integrated market...|$|E

40|$|An {{increase}} in the distributed <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> necessitates investments in the distribution network. The current tariff regulation in the Dutch electricity industry, with its ex post evaluation of the efficiency of investments, average benchmarking and a frontier shift in the x-factor, delays these investments. In the unbundled electricity industry, the investments in the network need to be coordinated {{with those in the}} distributed <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> to enable the system operators to build enough network capacity. The current Dutch regulations do not provide for a sufficient information exchange between the generators and the system operators to coordinate the investments. This paper analyses these two effects of the Dutch regulations, and suggests improvements to the regulation of the network connection and transportation tariffs to allow for sufficient network capacity and coordination between the investments in the network and in the <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity.</b> These improvements include locally differentiated tariffs that increase with an increasing concentration of distributed generatio...|$|R
