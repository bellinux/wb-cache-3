5000|$|A glomus jugulare tumor is a tumor of {{the part}} of the {{temporal}} bone in the skull that involves the middle and inner ear structures. This tumor can affect the ear, upper <b>neck,</b> <b>base</b> of the skull, and the surrounding blood vessels and nerves.|$|R
5000|$|The middle presacral neural spines, of {{the rear}} neck and front back, are divided or forked, and in the <b>neck</b> <b>base</b> and {{anterior}} dorsal vertebrae bear a median tubercle that {{is at least as}} large as the metapophyses, the prongs of the fork, resulting in a [...] "trifid" [...] condition.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{covers the}} broad {{spectrum}} of soft tissue lesions occurring {{in the head and}} <b>neck,</b> <b>based</b> on the current WHO classification. Most of these lesions are very rare, {{and there are a lot}} of overlapping features that hamper appropriate classification. Hence, not only morphological but also immunohistochemical and molecular genetic criteria helpful in making the diagnosis and comprehensive differential diagnoses are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|... {{also known}} as miKro RG series, this model is a smaller scale guitar {{designed}} for smaller hands, with a 22 inch, 24-fret <b>neck,</b> <b>based</b> upon the RG neck. These models use a fixed through body bridge. While normally provided with 2 pickups, a recent model was made available which replaced the neck pickup with an onboard 2.5 watt amplifier. With a recent update, the GRGM now uses Mahogany instead of Agathis for body wood.|$|R
50|$|Electrolysis {{is another}} hair removal method {{that has been}} used for over 135 years. Unlike laser epilation, {{electrolysis}} can be used to remove 100% of the hair from an area and is effective on hair of all colors, if used at an adequate power level with proper technique. More hair may grow in certain areas that are prone to hormone-induced growth (e.g. a woman's chin and <b>neck)</b> <b>based</b> on individual hormone levels or changes therein, and one's genetic predisposition to grow new hair.|$|R
40|$|Radiation {{exposure}} to the surgeon and patient was measured in 14 patients during internal fixation of trochanteric fractures of the femur. Dosimetry studies were also done to determine the directions of maximum scatter production. The {{results indicated that the}} standard lead apron suffices for adequate gonadal and bone marrow shielding but the surgeon is still exposed to significant radiation levels- to the extremities and <b>neck.</b> <b>Based</b> on these findings some recommendations for reduction of radiation {{exposure to}} the surgeon are presented...|$|R
40|$|Radiation {{planning}} {{for cancer therapy}} {{is becoming more and}} more dependent on the prediction of microscopic tumor spread to regional lymph nodes for its success. It is known that microscopic spread tends to follow established lymphatic drainage pathways in the head and <b>neck</b> <b>based</b> on the location of the primary tumor. In this paper, we propose a novel model for the prediction of regional lymphatic involvement of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma based on primary tumor location and T-stage. The proposed model operates from first anatomical principles and basic stochastic techniques, and is validated against surgical data...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{article will}} address pottery {{inscriptions}} {{found in an}} archaeological city of Aktobe, located at the middle reaches of the river Chu. Many inscriptions found on ceramics, dating to the IX-XI centuries, were found some rooms of a dwelling excavated in 2008 in the Shakhristan section of the medeival city (35 m X 10 m excavation block). The inscriptions were found on vessel bodies, <b>necks,</b> <b>bases,</b> or handles. In {{spite of the fact}} that inscriptions are often written vertically or horizontally, they are very similar. Our analysis demonstrates different styles and chronological periods for the inscribed ceramic vessels. Descriptions, photographs, and drawings of the inscribed vessels are presented here...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFibrosing {{mediastinitis}} is {{a chronic}} disease process with {{a spectrum of}} etiology. We report a 51 -year-old female who underwent incision and drainage procedure in the neck for deep neck and mediastinal abscess. Five years later she developed fibrosing mediastinitis. This lesion infiltrated from <b>neck</b> <b>base</b> into the upper mediastinum with tracheal compression and vessel encasement. She had resection of the lesion which {{proved to be a}} ruptured bronchogenic cyst with chronic inflammation. This rare case illustrates the importance of including inflammatory bronchogenic cyst in the etiology of deep neck abscess formation. And we further find a ruptured bronchogenic cyst with chronic inflammation as an etiology of fibrosing mediastinitis...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} 55 -year-old Japanese {{woman with a}} two-month history of {{multiple}} pruritic erythema and erosion {{on her face and}} <b>neck.</b> <b>Based</b> on the clinical appearance, we initially diagnosed her as having pemphigus erythematosus. However, the results of a histopathological examination and a direct immunofluorescence study did not support the initial diagnosis. Additionally, anti-desmoglein 1 and 3 antibodies were all negative. Subsequently, a microscopic examination of scales revealed filaments of fungi and a fungal culture was negative for macroconidium. Using molecular biology techniques, we identified the fungus as Microsporum canis, which causes a zoonotic infection. The immune reaction to the fungi could be drastic and therefore, the eruption sometimes displays atypical clinical manifestations...|$|R
40|$|Malignant {{melanoma}} {{is a rare}} {{tumor in}} otorhinolaryngology. In this paper, we have reported the first case of melanoma of nasopharynx which we came across in 20 years of ENT practice. A 55 year old male patient with complaints of swelling of nose and left side of neck, nasal blockage and epistaxis was diagnosed as melanoma of nose with metastasis in the <b>neck</b> <b>based</b> on clinical and radiological examination. The tumour was excised by lateral rhinotomy with supraomohyoid block dissection on the left side. The tumour was found to originate from lateral wall of nasopharynx and middle turbinate. The surgery was followed by radiotherapy. Diagnosis of melanoma was confirmed on histopathology. During 30 months follow-up, no recurrence was noticed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Seat is a {{main part}} of vehicle to contact with {{occupant}} in rear impact and chiefly concern with the severity of neck injuries. Therefore, improvement in seat design can effectively reduce the neck injuries of occupant. For designing an effective vehicle seat to protect occupant, this study develops the numerical model of sled test by using MADYMO software and discusses the relevance between the seat parameters and occupant’s <b>neck</b> <b>based</b> on the validated numerical model. The seat parameters include the stiffness of seat angle device, seat friction and angle of head restraint. The discussion of influencing factors of seat can be referred for designing a safety seat. The occupant neck then can be protected in rear impact accidents...|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, Gibson {{produced}} the L-5S, which was effectively a solid-body {{version of the}} L-5 archtop. It was used by Paul Simon and, from 1973-76, by Mark Farner of Grand Funk Railroad (he is seen with the guitar in cover photographs on the band's Caught In the Act live album); and a custom-made single-pickup version was made for Ronnie Wood, who loaned it to Keith Richards for his 1988 tour with the X-Pensive Winos. A double cutaway version of the L-5 has recently been introduced to the market. The body depth {{has been reduced to}} 2 3/8". The upper cutaway is purely cosmetic, since the <b>neck</b> <b>base</b> or heel prevents higher access to the frets.|$|R

40|$|Neck {{dissection}} is {{an important}} treatment for metastases from upper aerodigestive carcinoma; an event that markedly reduces survival. Since its inception, {{the philosophy of the}} procedure has undergone significant change from one of radicalism to the current conservative approach. Furthermore, nonsurgical modalities have been introduced, and, in many situations, have supplanted neck surgery. The refinements of imaging the <b>neck</b> <b>based</b> on the concept of neck level involvement has encouraged new philosophies to evolve that seem to benefit patient outcomes particularly as this relates to diminished morbidity. The purpose of this review was to highlight the new paradigms for surgical removal of neck metastases using an evidence-based approach. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

5000|$|In 1985, Dan Smith {{approached}} Clapton {{to discuss}} a plan to create a signature guitar built to his own specifications. Based on Clapton's brief, Fender made two early prototypes: one with a <b>neck</b> <b>based</b> on measurements taken from Blackie and one with a slightly softer V shape which Clapton ultimately deemed preferable. Both prototypes featured electronics based on the Elite Stratocaster including its 12 dB MDX mid-boost circuit intended to make the stratocasters' single-coils sound more like a humbucker. Clapton liked the boost circuit but asked for more dynamic range, prompting Fender to replace the [...] "Elite" [...] pickups with Gold Lace Sensor pickups and an updated MDX circuit that had been tweaked up to 25 dB boost in the midrange at around 500 Hz.|$|R

40|$|Several {{risk factors}} {{including}} short or highly angulated proximal aortic neck {{have been associated}} with long-term outcomes after endovascular or open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. However, research data have emerged recently concerning the behavior of proximal aortic neck, and several authors have tried to evaluate this behavior after endovascular or open repair. Additionally, computed tomography angiography (CTA) remains the golden standard for detecting and observing the morphology of an AAA, both before and after treatment. Moreover, {{the question of whether the}} proximal neck’s progression independently affects postoperative morbidity and reintervention risks still remains. Therefore, this focused review aims to present all relevant data on the behavior of an AAAs <b>neck,</b> <b>based</b> on CTA imaging before and after repair, in order to produce useful conclusions for future clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The major aim of {{this study}} was to explore how the body parts play roles in Persian {{political}} texts as metaphorical expressions according to cognitive point of view. Due to this fact, by examining a number of contemporary political expressions, the accumulated data were attributed into different body members including: dast (hand), cheshm (eye), sar (head), pā(foot), ru (face), dahān (mouth), del (stomach, heart), shāne (shoulder), angosht (finger), zabān (tongue), dandān (tooth), gush (ear), sine (breast), ghalb (heart) and gardan (<b>neck).</b> <b>Based</b> on the findings, there are fifteen body members by applying which the political metaphors are conceptualized and reflected in Persian political discourse. Furthermore, the results obtained from the current study revealed that among the human body members which are conceptualized in Persian political texts, "head " is the most frequent one...|$|R

25|$|The {{empty space}} between the pubic bones and the {{intestines}} has by G.S. Paul and David Martill been hypothesised {{to have been the}} location of a large air-sac. Dal Sasso & Maganuco however, rejected this interpretation because with living birds the air-sac of the posterior abdomen does not force the intestines forwards. They considered the space {{more likely to have been}} filled by a large yolk-sac. Air-sacs were nevertheless probable given the pneumatisation of the vertebrae. Vertebrae without pneumatopores would have indicated the boundaries between three air-sac systems: those of the <b>neck</b> <b>base,</b> the lungs, and the abdomen. The double rib heads would indicate a rather stiff thorax, ventilated by the gastralia. A system of hook-like uncinate processes on the ribs as with the Maniraptoriformes, allowing the ribcage to move flexibly, in articulation with an ossified sternum, was absent in Scipionyx.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An eleven year-old mongrel dog was {{referred}} {{with a history}} of left forelimb lameness and an ulcerated mass on the neck. Histologically, the cutaneous neoplasm revealed cystic lobules composed of basaloid cells with abrupt tran-sition to central keratotic material, containing pycnotic and shadow cells. Approximately 3 months after primary diag-nosis, a lesion of the cortical bone on the left humerus was observed using X-ray. Samples obtained from the humerus were processed for histopathological examination and the neoplastic tissue was observed to be similar to the type identified in the <b>neck.</b> <b>Based</b> on these findings, the tumor was diagnosed as a malignant pilomatricoma (MP) with bone metastasis. MP is a rare skin tumor that originates from hair matrix cells. To date, only nine reports have been presented in dogs.

5|$|The neotype {{skeleton}} {{had been}} uncovered in the Black Ven Marl or Woodstone Nodule Bed, marine deposits of the Charmouth Mudstone Formation, {{dating from the}} late Sinemurian stage, about 191 million years ago. It consists of a rather complete skeleton with skull and lower jaws. Only the snout tip, the <b>neck</b> <b>base,</b> the forelimbs and the tail end are missing. Hundreds of osteoderms were found {{in connection with the}} skeleton, many more or less in their original position. From the 1960s onward, this fossil was further prepared by Ronald Croucher using acid baths to free the bones from the surrounding matrix, a method perfected for the Charmouth fossils. In 1992, Charig reported that only a single block had yet to be treated, but he died before the results could be published. Norman, who intends to complete this task, has revealed some new anatomical details in 2004. Apart from these, a modern description is largely lacking.|$|R
25|$|The {{vertebral}} column of Scipionyx probably includes ten cervical vertebrae and thirteen dorsal vertebrae; {{due to the}} fact the specimen is just a hatchling, the differentiation between the two categories has not fully developed, making any distinction rather arbitrary. With certainty five sacral vertebrae are present. The fossil has preserved just nine tail vertebrae; likely fifty or more had been originally present. The neck vertebrae are opisthocoelous. The axis is pneumatised as a pneumatopore, an opening through which a diverticulum of the air sack of the <b>neck</b> <b>base</b> could reach its hollow interior, is visible on its side. The third, fourth and fifth vertebrae also show pneumatopores but the consecutive series lacks them, which is surprising as it had been assumed the pneumatisation process would have started at the back, working itself forward. Contrary to what was stated by the 1998 study, the cervical ribs are very elongated, with a length of up to three vertebral centra.|$|R
500|$|The {{vertebral}} column of Stegoceras is incompletely known. The articulation between the zygagophyses (articular processes) of successive dorsal (back) vertebrae {{appears to have}} prevented sideways movement of the {{vertebral column}}, which made it very rigid, and it was further strengthened by ossified tendons. Though the neck vertebrae are not known, the downturned occipital condyle (which articulates with the first neck vertebra) indicates that the neck was held in a curved posture, like the [...] "S"- or [...] "U"-shape of most dinosaur <b>necks.</b> <b>Based</b> on {{their position in the}} pachycephalosaur Homalocephale, the ossified tendons found with UALVP 2 would have formed an intricate [...] "caudal basket" [...] in the tail, consisting of parallel rows, with the extremities of each tendon contacting the next successively. Such structures are called myorhabdoi, and are otherwise only known in teleost fish; the feature is unique to pachycephalosaurs among tetrapod (four-limbed) animals, and may have functioned in stiffening the tail.|$|R
500|$|Psilocybe makarorae is {{a species}} of {{psilocybin}} mushroom in the family Strophariaceae. Officially described as new to science in 1995, it is known only from New Zealand, where it grows on rotting wood and twigs of southern beeches. The fruit body (mushroom) has a brownish cap with lighter coloured margins, measuring up to [...] wide. The cap shape is either conical, bell-shaped, or flat depending on {{the age of the}} mushroom, and it features a prominent umbo. Although the whitish stem does not form a true ring, it retains remnants of the partial veil that covers and protects the gills of young fruit bodies. P.makarorae mushrooms can be distinguished from the similar North American species Psilocybe caerulipes by microscopic characteristics such as the presence of cystidia on the gill faces (pleurocystidia), and cheilocystidia (found on the gill edges) with more elongated <b>necks.</b> <b>Based</b> on the bluing reaction to injury, P.makarorae is presumed to contain the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and psilocin.|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} this {{inscription}} consists of runic text inscribed within a serpent band which circles the stylized figures {{of a man}} on a horse and of a bird. The stone is composed of granite and is 1.9 meters in height. The inscription is tentatively classified as being carved in runestone style Pr3, which is also known as Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads on Pr3 inscriptions are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the <b>necks.</b> <b>Based</b> on stylistic analysis, the inscription has been attributed to the Swedish runemaster Fot, who was active in Sweden in the mid-eleventh century. Fot was noted for the consistency of his use of the punctuation mark × between the words in the runic inscription, which is evident in the runic text of this inscription.|$|R
