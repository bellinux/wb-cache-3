5|$|The X-ray {{spectroscopy}} done by Henry Moseley in 1914 {{showed a}} direct dependency between spectral line and effective <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge.</b> This {{led to the}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge,</b> or atomic number of an element, being used to ascertain its place within the periodic table. With this method, Moseley determined the number of lanthanides and showed the gaps in the atomic number sequence at numbers 43, 61, 72, and 75.|$|E
5|$|This {{exception}} arises due to competing {{horizontal and}} vertical trends in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge.</b> Going along a period, the <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge</b> increases with atomic number as do the number of electrons. The additional pull on outer electrons as <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge</b> increases generally outweighs the screening effect of having more electrons. With some irregularities, atoms therefore become smaller, ionization energy increases, {{and there is a}} gradual change in character, across a period, from strongly metallic, to weakly metallic, to weakly nonmetallic, to strongly nonmetallic elements. Going down a main group, the effect of increasing <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge</b> is generally outweighed by the effect of additional electrons being further away from the nucleus. Atoms generally become larger, ionization energy falls, and metallic character increases. The net effect is that the location of the metal–nonmetal transition zone shifts to the right in going down a group, and analogous diagonal similarities are seen elsewhere in the periodic table, as noted.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine atoms {{have nine}} {{electron}}s, one fewer than neon, and electron configuration 1s22s22p5: two electrons in a filled inner shell and seven in an outer shell requiring one {{more to be}} filled. The outer electrons are ineffective at nuclear shielding, and experience a high effective <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge</b> of 9 − 2 = 7; this affects the atom's physical properties.|$|E

5|$|The atomic radii of the {{alkali metals}} {{increase}} {{going down the}} group. Because of the shielding effect, when an atom {{has more than one}} electron shell, each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus. In the alkali metals, the outermost electron only feels a net charge of +1, as some of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge</b> (which is equal to the atomic number) is cancelled by the inner electrons; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge.</b> Therefore, the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the group, the atomic radius must also increase down the group.|$|E
5|$|The {{energy of}} an emitted photon is {{proportional}} to its frequency, so these specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the electromagnetic spectrum. Each element has a characteristic spectrum that can depend on the <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge,</b> subshells filled by electrons, the electromagnetic interactions between the electrons and other factors.|$|E
5|$|Electronegativity is a {{chemical}} property {{that describes the}} tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. If the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent, the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge</b> on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted {{so close to the}} chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an ionic bond). However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge</b> from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them. As mentioned previously, francium is expected to be an exception.|$|E

40|$|The {{effective}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>charges</b> (Z.,ff), {{which are}} empirical parameters in an approximate spin-orbit Hamiltonian, are determined for main group {{elements in the}} second to fifth periods by using experimental results for the fine structure splittings (FSS) in II states of diatomic hydrides. All calculations use full valence multiconfiguration self-consistent field (MCSCF) wave functions with the effective core potential (ECP) basis sets proposed by Stevens et al., augmented by one set of polarization functions. These effective <b>nuclear</b> <b>charges</b> are tested by predicting the FSS in many diatomic molecules and are then applied to evaluate the relativistic potential energy curves of the methylene analogs AHz (A = C, Si, Ge, and Sn), as well as XHX and NaX (X = Br and 1) ...|$|R
5|$|Later in {{the same}} year Henry Moseley {{provided}} additional experimental evidence in favor of Niels Bohr's theory. These results refined Ernest Rutherford's and Antonius Van den Broek's model, which proposed that the atom contains in its nucleus a number of positive nuclear charges that is equal to its (atomic) number in the periodic table. Until these experiments, atomic number was not known to be a physical and experimental quantity. That it is equal to the atomic <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge</b> remains the accepted atomic model today.|$|E
5|$|The ionic radii of the {{alkali metals}} are {{much smaller than}} their atomic radii. This is because the {{outermost}} electron of the alkali metals is in a different electron shell than the inner electrons, and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller. Additionally, the effective <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge</b> has increased, and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases.|$|E
5|$|The {{stability}} of the 6s shell {{is due to the}} presence of a filled 4f shell. An f shell poorly screens the <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge</b> that increases the attractive Coulomb interaction of the 6s shell and the nucleus (see lanthanide contraction). The absence of a filled inner f shell is the reason for the somewhat higher melting temperature of cadmium and zinc, although both these metals still melt easily and, in addition, have unusually low boiling points.|$|E
40|$|A {{well-defined}} {{notion of}} chemical compound space (CCS) {{is essential for}} gaining rigorous control of properties through variation of elemental composition and atomic configurations. Here, we give an introduction to an atomistic first principles perspective on CCS. First, CCS is {{discussed in terms of}} variational <b>nuclear</b> <b>charges</b> in the context of conceptual density functional and molecular grand-canonical ensemble theory. Thereafter, we revisit the notion of compound pairs, related to each other via “alchemical” interpolations involving fractional <b>nuclear</b> <b>charges</b> in the electronic Hamiltonian. We address Taylor expansions in CCS, property nonlinearity, improved predictions using reference compound pairs, and the ounce-of-gold prize challenge to linearize CCS. Finally, we turn to machine learning of analytical structure property relationships in CCS. These relationships correspond to inferred, rather than derived through variational principle, solutions of the electronic Schrödinger equation...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{two different}} models of a hydrogenic atom in a quantized electromagnetic field that treat the electron relativistically. The {{first one is}} a no-pair model in the free picture, the second one is given by the semi-relativistic Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian. We prove that the no-pair operator is semi-bounded below and that its spectral subspaces corresponding to energies below the ionization threshold are exponentially localized. Both results hold true, for arbitrary values of the fine-structure constant, e^ 2, and the ultra-violet cut-off, Λ, and for all <b>nuclear</b> <b>charges</b> less than the critical charge without radiation field, Z_c=e^- 22 /(2 /π+π/ 2).

40|$|The {{effective}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>charges,</b> {{which are}} empirical parameters in the approximate spin-orbit Hamiltonian, are determined for the first- and second-row {{elements in the}} periodic table using the experimental results of the fine structure splittings in the doublet and triplet II states of AH molecules (A is an atom in {{the first or second}} row). All calculations are performed using the full optimized reaction space multiconfiguration self-consistent-field wave functions with the 6 - 3 lG(d,p) basis set. Using these effective <b>nuclear</b> <b>charges,</b> the fine structure splittings calculated for the doublet and triplet II states of many diatomic molecules are in excellent agreement with experimental results.

5|$|There {{are some}} {{exceptions}} to this general rule. Gallium and germanium have higher electronegativities than aluminium and silicon respectively because of the d-block contraction. Elements of the fourth period immediately after the first row of the transition metals have unusually small atomic radii because the 3d-electrons are not effective at shielding the increased <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge,</b> and smaller atomic size correlates with higher electronegativity. The anomalously high electronegativity of lead, particularly when compared to thallium and bismuth, {{appears to be an}} artifact of data selection (and data availability)—methods of calculation other than the Pauling method show the normal periodic trends for these elements.|$|E
5|$|Cerium is {{the second}} element of the {{lanthanide}} series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides lanthanum to its left and praseodymium to its right, and above the actinide thorium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness {{similar to that of}} silver. Its 58 electrons are arranged in the configuration 4f15d16s2, of which the four outer electrons are valence electrons. Immediately after lanthanum, the 4f orbitals suddenly contract and are lowered in energy {{to the point that they}} participate readily in chemical reactions; however, this effect is not yet strong enough at cerium and thus the 5d subshell is still occupied. Most lanthanides can use only three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: cerium is an exception because of the stability of the empty f-shell in Ce4+ and the fact that it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge</b> is still low enough until neodymium to allow the removal of the fourth valence electron.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine has two stable {{isotopes}}, 35Cl and 37Cl. These are {{its only}} two natural isotopes occurring in quantity, with 35Cl making up 76% of natural chlorine and 37Cl {{making up the}} remaining 24%. Both are synthesised in stars in the oxygen-burning and silicon-burning processes. Both have nuclear spin 3/2+ and thus {{may be used for}} nuclear magnetic resonance, although the spin magnitude being greater than 1/2 results in non-spherical <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge</b> distribution and thus resonance broadening {{as a result of a}} nonzero nuclear quadrupole moment and resultant quadrupolar relaxation. The other chlorine isotopes are all radioactive, with half-lives too short to occur in nature primordially. Of these, the most commonly used in the laboratory are 36Cl (t1/2 = 3.0×105y) and 38Cl (t1/2 = 37.2min), which may be produced from the neutron activation of natural chlorine.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{most other}} parts of the grand river {{rerouting}} scheme, the Pechora to Kama route did not just stay on the drawing board. It saw actual on-the-ground work done, of the most unusual kind: on March 23, 1971, three 15-kiloton underground <b>nuclear</b> <b>charges</b> were exploded near the village of Vasyukovo in Cherdynsky District of Perm Oblast, some 100 km north of the town of Krasnovishersk. This nuclear test, known as Taiga, part of the Soviet peaceful nuclear explosions program, was intended to demonstrate the feasibility of using nuclear explosions for canal construction. The triple blast created a crater over 600 meters long. Later on, it was decided that building an entire canal in this fashion, using potentially several hundreds of <b>nuclear</b> <b>charges,</b> would not be feasible, and the use of nuclear bombs for canal excavation was abandoned.|$|R
5|$|Like most lanthanides, {{praseodymium}} {{usually only}} uses three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: {{this is because}} the 4f orbitals penetrate the most through the inert xenon core of electrons to the nucleus, followed by 5d and 6s, and this increases with higher ionic charge. Praseodymium nevertheless can continue losing a fourth and even occasionally a fifth valence electron because it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge</b> is still low enough and the 4f subshell energy high enough to allow the removal of further valence electrons. Thus, similarly to the other early trivalent lanthanides, praseodymium has a double hexagonal close-packed crystal structure at room temperature. At about 560°C, it transitions to a face-centered cubic structure, and a body-centered cubic structure appears shortly before the melting point of 935°C.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford gave Chadwick a {{part-time}} teaching position at Manchester, {{allowing him to}} continue research. He looked at the <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge</b> of platinum, silver, and copper, and experimentally found {{that this was the}} same as the atomic number within an error of less than 1.5 per cent. In April 1919, Rutherford became director of the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, and Chadwick joined him there a few months later. Chadwick was awarded a Clerk-Maxwell studentship in 1920, and enrolled as a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) student at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. The first half of his thesis was his work with atomic numbers. In the second, he looked at the forces inside the nucleus. His degree was awarded in June 1921. In November, he became a Fellow of Gonville and Caius College.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of fermium {{has only been}} studied in solution using tracer techniques, and no solid compounds have been prepared. Under normal conditions, fermium exists in solution as the Fm3+ ion, which has a hydration number of 16.9 and an acid dissociation constant of 1.6 (pKa= 3.8). Fm3+ forms complexes {{with a wide variety}} of organic ligands with hard donor atoms such as oxygen, and these complexes are usually more stable than those of the preceding actinides. It also forms anionic complexes with ligands such as chloride or nitrate and, again, these complexes appear to be more stable than those formed by einsteinium or californium. It is believed that the bonding in the complexes of the later actinides is mostly ionic in character: the Fm3+ ion is expected to be smaller than the preceding An3+ ions because of the higher effective <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge</b> of fermium, and hence fermium would be expected to form shorter and stronger metal–ligand bonds.|$|E

5|$|The {{electrons}} in the 4f-subshell, which is progressively filled from cerium (element 58) to ytterbium (element 70), {{are not particularly}} effective at shielding the increasing <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge</b> from the sub-shells further out. The elements immediately following the lanthanides have atomic radii that are smaller than would be expected and that are almost identical to the atomic radii of the elements immediately above them. Hence hafnium has virtually the same atomic radius (and chemistry) as zirconium, and tantalum has an atomic radius similar to niobium, and so forth. This {{is known as the}} lanthanide contraction. The effect of the lanthanide contraction is noticeable up to platinum (element 78), after which it is masked by a relativistic effect known as the inert pair effect. The d-block contraction, which is a similar effect between the d-block and p-block, is less pronounced than the lanthanide contraction but arises from a similar cause.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} are highly {{reactive}} and are never found in elemental forms in nature. Because of this, {{they are usually}} stored in mineral oil or kerosene (paraffin oil). They react aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali metal halides, which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride (LiF). The alkali metals also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled with great care. The heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones; for example, when dropped into water, caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium if {{the same number of}} moles of each metal is used. The alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge</b> and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron. Not only do the alkali metals react with water, but also with proton donors like alcohols and phenols, gaseous ammonia, and alkynes, the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity. Their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium {{had been}} {{predicted}} by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869 and Henry Moseley measured in 1914 the effective <b>nuclear</b> <b>charge</b> by X-ray spectroscopy to be 72, placing it between the already known elements lutetium and tantalum. Dirk Coster and Georg von Hevesy {{were the first}} to search for the new element in zirconium ores. Hafnium was discovered by the two in 1923 in Copenhagen, Denmark, validating the original 1869 prediction of Mendeleev. There has been some controversy surrounding the discovery of hafnium {{and the extent to which}} Coster and Hevesy were guided by Bohr's prediction that hafnium would be a transition metal rather than a rare earth element. While titanium and zirconium, as relatively abundant elements, were discovered in the late 18th century, it took until 1923 for hafnium to be identified. This was only partly due to hafnium's relative scarcity. The chemical similarity between zirconium and hafnium made a separation difficult and, without knowing what to look for, hafnium was left undiscovered, although all samples of zirconium, and all of its compounds, used by chemists for over two centuries contained significant amounts of hafnium..|$|E
