5000|$|Polish Jacobins formed {{during the}} Great Sejm as an {{offshoot}} of the [...] "Kołłątaj's Forge" [...] (Kuźnia Kołłątajska) of Hugo Kołłątaj (hence their alternate name - Huguenots (Hugoniści) and later the Patriotic Party (Stronnictwo Patriotyczne). Polish Jacobins played a significant part in the preparation of the Warsaw Uprising and Wilno Uprising during the Kościuszko Uprising. Under the name of Association of Citizens Offering Help and Assistance to <b>National</b> <b>Magistrate</b> for Good of the Homeland (Zgromadzenie Obywateli Ofiarujących Pomoc i Posługę Magistraturom Narodowym w Celu Dobra Ojczyzny) they formed a political club (based on French Jacobin Club) which became part of the provisional government of Poland (Temporary Provisional Council, Radza Zastępcza Tymczasowa). For their support for lynching of supporters of the Targowica Confederation they have been abolished by Tadeusz Kościuszko, but as the Uprising neared its defeat they were reactivated under the name of Association for Supporting the Revolution and the Cracow Act (Zgromadzenie dla Utrzymania Rewolucji i Aktu Krakowskiego). After the third partition of Poland, many Jacobins emigrated and joined the Polish Legions in Italy. Many of those who remained in Poland took part in various conspirational organisations (Association of Polish Republicans, Towarzystwo Republikanów Polskich). Eventually some prominent Jacobins (like Józef Zajączek) became part of the government of the Duchy of Warsaw and later Congress Poland). During the November Uprising they were reactivated as Patriotic Society (Towarzystwo Patriotyczne), founded by Joachim Lelewel. Polish Jacobins slowly became absorbed into other groups of the Great Emigration, although traces of their ideas were visible not only in the January Uprising but also in the Józef Piłsudski's Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna).|$|E

50|$|Dominican law prohibits {{all forms}} of {{trafficking}} through its comprehensive anti-trafficking Law 137-03, which prescribes penalties of up to 20 years’ imprisonment. The government reported 36 persons “currently in preventive detention” under Law 137-03, but these data conflate trafficking and smuggling, as Law 137-03 covers both. Authorities reported the government may prosecute trafficking offenders under other statutes; NGO observers have said corruption {{on the part of}} authorities is a problem. The government reported it provided training for officials posted abroad on identifying and assisting trafficking victims, and each year, judges take an online course on trafficking, available through the <b>National</b> <b>Magistrates</b> School. The government has claimed to have made several efforts to identify and protect trafficking victims, but results were limited. The government has not clarified whether it has a formal mechanism to guide officials in proactively identifying victims among vulnerable groups and refer them to available services offered by NGOs. The government provided $13,500 in support for an NGO-run shelter and religious order that assisted adult, female victims.|$|R

He went to Paris, then to Dakar, Senegal, where he taught law, before going to Libreville, Gabon, where he again practiced law.|$|R
6000|$|How I {{wish you}} could have been there! The hearing lasted three days, and I would not have missed a minute of it. As it was, I did not miss a syllable, and it was so deeply printed on my mind that I believe I could repeat it word for word if I had to. But, in the first place, I must try and realize the scene to you. I was once summoned as a witness in one of our courts, you remember, and I have never {{forgotten}} the horror of it: the hot, dirty room, with its foul air, the brutal spectators, the policemen stationed among them to keep them in order, the lawyers with the plaintiff and defendant seated all at one table, the uncouth abruptness of the clerks and janitors, or whatever, the undignified magistrate, who looked as if his lunch had made him drowsy, and who seemed half asleep, as he slouched in his arm-chair behind his desk. Instead of such a setting as this, you must imagine a vast marble amphitheatre, larger than the Metropolitan Opera, by three or four times, all the gradines overflowing (that is the word for the [...] "liquefaction of the clothes" [...] which poured over them), and looking like those Bermudan waters where the colors of the rainbow seem dropped around the coast. On the platform, or stage, sat the Presidents of the Assembly, and on a tier of seats behind and above them, the <b>national</b> <b>Magistrates,</b> who, as this is the capital of the republic for the time being, had decided to be present at the hearing, because they thought the case so very important. In the hollow space, just below (like that where you remember the Chorus stood in that Greek play which we saw at Harvard ages ago), were the captain and the first-mate on one hand, and the seamen on the other; the second-mate, our particular friend, was not there because he never goes ashore anywhere, and had chosen to remain with the black cook in charge of the ship. The captain's wife would rather have stayed with them, but I persuaded her to come to us for the days of the hearing, because the captain had somehow thought we were opposed to him, and because I thought she ought to be there to encourage him by her presence. She sat next to me, in a hat which I {{wish you could}} have seen, Dolly, and a dress which would have set your teeth on edge; but inside of them I knew {{she was one of the}} best souls in the world, and I loved her the more for being the sight she was among those wonderful Altrurian women.|$|R
40|$|In 1971, an Aboriginal {{man named}} Mervyn Eades was convicted {{for failing to}} {{register}} for <b>national</b> service. The <b>magistrate</b> determined that while Eades was indeed Aboriginal under Western Australian law, under the National Service Act he was not. Scrutiny of Eades’ case exposes the interconnected issues of Aboriginality, racial discrimination, assimilation, federalism and conscription in the period between the 1967 Referendum and the 1972 election. Eades’ conviction represented a unique junction of these seemingly disparate political issues which gradually converged. Analysis of Eades’ case and the wider issue of Aboriginal people and national service highlights ongoing legislative discrimination in the immediate post-Referendum period, the problematic status of concurrent Aboriginal affairs powers and the McMahon Liberal government 2 ̆ 7 s determination — ultimately unsuccessfully — to avoid conflation of conscription and race politics...|$|R
40|$|Doing {{ethnography}} on {{prisons and}} penal confinement in Portugal since 1987, I have had several occasions {{to interact with}} publics implicated in policy-definition or policy implementation at different levels, {{as well as with}} a variety of institutional agents and frontline personnel acting one way or another upon what they generally define as a “social issue” or a “social problem”. From policy officials, committees for prison reform, <b>magistrates,</b> <b>national</b> or local prison directors, to social workers and other actors, these were policy-oriented audiences, regardless of the nature or the degree of their power to intervene on that problem. Their expectations in relation to prison-research and its outcomes are formed within particular frames (the “denunciation” of prison ills, the production of “specific recommendations” to remedy them…). For my part, although I consider my research to have policy implications, it was not itself policy-driven or designed for policy. However, in spite of being far from matching these audiences’ dominant frame of expectations, my work was surprisingly well received and did produce a particular form of impact relevant for policy. Taking stock of this main experience of publicizing ethnographic research, and with the perspective added later on by the outcome of an entirely different ethnographic inquiry on vaccine acceptability and non-immunization, communicated to another policy-oriented audience, this chapter reflects on ethnographic relevance and on the ingredients that can render ethnographic accounts valuable and persuasive to those publics. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
5000|$|On 5 February, {{following}} {{a speech by}} Samba-Panza had told 4,000 troops and dignitaries at the <b>National</b> School of <b>Magistrates</b> that she had [...] "pride in seeing so many elements of the Central African Republic Forces reunited," [...] uniformed soldiers attacked a civilian youth by stamping on his head, stabbing him and throwing stones at him after accusing him of being an infiltrated Séléka member. His body was then dragged through the streets as MISCA troops looked on; it was then dismembered and burned before the MISCA troops intervened to disperse the crowd with tear gas and firing shots into the air. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said: [...] "This sectarian violence must end. people of the CAR {{break the cycle of}} violence.
