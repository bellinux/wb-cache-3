25|$|He was {{possibly}} the Theban proxenos or consul for Aegina and/or Molossia, {{as indicated in}} another of his odes, Nemean 7, in which he glorifies Neoptolemus, a national hero of Aegina and Molossia. According to tradition, Neoptolemus died disgracefully {{in a fight with}} priests at the temple in Delphi over their share of some sacrificial meat. Pindar diplomatically glosses over this and concludes mysteriously with an earnest protestation of innocence"But shall my heart <b>never</b> <b>admit</b> that I with words none can redeem dishonoured Neoptolemus". Possibly he was responding to anger among Aeginetans and/or Molossians over his portrayal of Neoptolemus in an earlier poem, Paean 6, which had been commissioned by the priests at Delphi and which depicted the hero's death in traditional terms, as divine retribution for his crimes.|$|E

While interviewed in 1989, Papps explained that he would <b>never</b> <b>admit</b> to being the [...] "sex symbol" [...] that he was labelled as. He thought it was [...] "nice to be loved and accepted" [...] but the fame the role generated became an [...] "intrusion" [...] on his privacy.

[...] Rory Cashin of Slate lauded Diamandis's lyrics as [...] "esoteric," [...] likening her to an [...] "emotionally intelligent outsider who knew how to perfectly articulate those weird thoughts and reactions we all have but would <b>never</b> <b>admit</b> to."

500|$|O'Reilly {{thought the}} {{development}} was interesting {{as the old}} Naomi would have teamed up with Dimato. Dimato later tried to bribe Naomi and Brennan encouraged {{her to go to}} the police, but she refused and gave the money back. Brennan confronted Dimato, who then cornered Naomi and threatened her for talking about the bribe. O'Reilly commented that Naomi was annoyed at Brennan's interference, as she felt she could handle Dimato. She continued, [...] "She's tough as nails. She would <b>never</b> <b>admit</b> there is danger there – and especially not to Brennan!" [...] Matt Turner (Josef Brown) later asked for Naomi's help, so the police could build a case against Dimato. Naomi gave a statement even though she was still receiving threats from Dimato and his men. Dimato later targeted Sheila, forcing Naomi to retract her statement. Matt tried to get her to change her mind, but it was only when Sheila learned what she had done and told her to re-submit her statement, that Naomi agreed.|$|E
500|$|The dossier {{consists}} of two folders. The first is a [...] "personal file" [...] containing 90 pages of documents, including a handwritten commitment {{to cooperate with the}} secret police dated 21 December 1970, and signed Lech Wałęsa – Bolek with a pledge he would <b>never</b> <b>admit</b> his collaboration with secret police “not even to family”; the file also contains the confirmations of having received funds. The second is a [...] "work file" [...] which contains 279 pages of documents, including numerous reports by Bolek on his co-workers at Gdańsk Shipyard, and notes by secret police officers from meetings with him. According to one note, Wałęsa agreed to collaborate out of fear of persecution after the workers’ protest in 1970. The documents also show that at first Bolek eagerly provided information on opinions and actions by his co-workers and took money for the information, but his enthusiasm diminished and the quality of his information decreased until he was deemed no longer valuable and collaboration with him was terminated in 1976.|$|E
500|$|McEwen faced {{questions}} about the bounced checks he had written on the House bank. Buchert ran campaign commercials citing McEwen's checks, the expenses of his Congressional office, and his campaign finance disclosures, while noting Portman was [...] "the handpicked choice of the downtown money crowd" [...] and was [...] "a registered foreign agent for the biggest Democrat lobbying firm in Washington," [...] labeling Portman and McEwen [...] "Prince Rob and Bouncing Bob." [...] McEwen, who had taken a hard-line on his checks in 1992, relented in the campaign. Martin Gottlieb wrote, [...] "McEwen says now that his problem {{was a form of}} excessive pride. He says he used to 'demand perfection' of himself." [...] McEwen also said, [...] "I felt I could <b>never</b> <b>admit</b> a mistake.... I am very, very sorry. I should have watched it more carefully.... I have learned a great deal." [...] Les Spaeth, chairman of the Warren County Republican Party and former Warren County Auditor, said, [...] "People very much disliked the check overdraft thing, but I think they don't see it as happening again. I think it's past. He made a mistake and he got caught. But that's overridden by the service he's given, particularly to our county." ...|$|E

500|$|Ned Flanders, who was {{designed}} by Rich Moore, {{first appeared in the}} season one episode [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire". The episode was the series premiere, but not the first episode produced. The first episode in which Flanders and his family were prominent is season two's [...] "Dead Putting Society", which also contained the first appearance of Maude and Rod Flanders. The character was named after Flanders Street in Portland, Oregon, the hometown of Simpsons creator Matt Groening. Groening described the inspiration for Flanders as [...] "just a guy who was truly nice, that Homer had no justifiable reason to loathe, but then did". It was not until after the first few episodes that it was decided Flanders would be a faithful Christian. Mike Scully noted that Flanders is [...] "everything Homer would love to be, although he'll <b>never</b> <b>admit</b> it". Flanders had been meant to be just a neighbor that Homer was jealous of, but Harry Shearer used [...] "such a sweet voice" [...] and Flanders was broadened to become a Christian and a sweet guy that someone would prefer to live next to over Homer. Flanders is known for his nonsensical jabbering. His first use of the word [...] "diddly" [...] was in [...] "The Call of the Simpsons".|$|E
500|$|In March 1998 the Crime Commission {{released}} its findings, {{stating that the}} crimes that resulted in convictions occurred substantially in the way described to the courts, that no further charges would be laid as Webster had acted alone in both the murder and the assault that immediately preceded it, and that police had not acted inappropriately in their decision not to charge other persons. It did, however, criticise some police procedures and practices. The review did {{not comment on the}} discrepancies between Webster's confession and the forensic evidence, and it did not clarify whether forensic evidence was ever sent for testing. A representative for the Commission refused to comment on whether Wilson's blood-stained shirt was ever tested. One expert opinion obtained by the Commission wrote that it was [...] "likely [...] engaged in sexual behaviour which demeaned Leigh and to which he will <b>never</b> <b>admit</b> because he is ashamed and embarrassed", and Dr Johan Duflou said that a finger or penis was unlikely to have caused Leigh's severe genital damage. Hillary Byrne-Armstrong stated that these expert opinions, which contradict Webster's confession, raised questions on how the Commission concluded that Leigh's sexual assault occurred in the manner to which he had confessed, also raising doubts about several of the Commission's other findings. The Crime Commission released one of their two reports on the matter; their second unpublished report was handed over to the Police Integrity Commission (PIC) for investigation.|$|E

2500|$|... {{showing that}} the soul is immortal {{as it is the}} cause of life. He begins by showing that [...] "if there is {{anything}} beautiful other than absolute beauty it is beautiful only insofar as it partakes of absolute beauty". Consequently, as absolute beauty is a Form, and so is the soul, then anything which has the property of being infused with a soul is so infused with the Form of soul. As an example he says, [...] "will not the number three endure annihilation or anything sooner than be converted into an even number, while remaining three?". Forms, then, will never become their opposite. As the soul is that which renders the body living, and that the opposite of life is death, it so follows that, [...] "...the soul will <b>never</b> <b>admit</b> the opposite of what she always brings." [...] That which does not admit death is said to be immortal.|$|E

2500|$|ABC interviewed {{forensic}} psychiatrist Dr. James Knoll {{for psychological}} {{perspective on the}} case and he answered viewers' questions via video on April 23, 2009, and via site comments on April 27, 2009. He stated that while most suicide notes focus on themes of remorse and the person {{not being able to}} go on with life, the note supposedly written by Ashley was focused on taking the blame off of Castor. He said that this theme was repeated fourteen times within the note and that he believes Castor will <b>never</b> <b>admit</b> to guilt of the murders. The code of murderers such as these, he said, is [...] "deny, deny, deny" [...] until the bitter end. When asked if Castor's behavior and body language on the stand shows any sort of clue about her mental state and guilt, Knoll reminded that body language and behavior can be affected by events during a trial (such as [...] "side effects of medications, anxiety, fatigue and attorney instructions to the defendant on how to behave") and that their interpretation is not always reliable.|$|E

[...] In a 2011 Guardian article about his critical Melody Maker review, Beaumont wrote: [...] "Kid A status as a cultural cornerstone has proved me, if not wrong, then {{very much in the}} minority... People whose opinions I trust claim it to be their favourite album ever." [...] Grantland credited Kid A for ushering the modern age of internet music streaming and promotion, writing: [...] "For many music fans of a certain age and persuasion, Kid A was the first album experienced primarily via the internet– it's where you went to hear it, read the reviews, and argue about whether it was a masterpiece... Listen early, form an opinion quickly, state it publicly, and {{move on to the next}} big record by the official release date. In that way, Kid A invented modern music culture as we know it." [...] In 2015, Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Nobody admits now they hated Kid A at the time, the same way folkies <b>never</b> <b>admit</b> they booed Dylan for going electric. Nobody wants to be the clod who didn't get it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Romero preached that [...] "The most {{profound}} social revolution is the serious, supernatural, interior reform of a Christian." [...] He also emphasized: [...] "The liberation of Christ and of His Church is not {{reduced to the}} dimension of a purely temporal project. It does not reduce its objectives to an anthropocentric perspective: to a material well-being or only to initiatives of a political or social, economic or cultural order. Much less can it be a liberation that supports or is supported by violence." [...] Romero expressed several times his disapproval for divisiveness in the Church. In a sermon preached on 11 November 1979 he said: [...] "The other day, one of the persons who proclaims liberation in a political sense was asked: ‘For you, {{what is the meaning}} of the Church’?" [...] He said that the activist [...] "answered with these scandalous words: ‘There are two churches, the church of the rich and the church of the poor. We believe in the church of the poor but not in the church of the rich.’" [...] Romero declared, [...] "Clearly these words are a form of demagogy and I will <b>never</b> <b>admit</b> a division of the Church." [...] He added, [...] "There is only one Church, the Church that Christ preached, the Church to which we should give our whole hearts. ...There is only one Church, a Church that adores the living God and knows how to give relative value to the goods of this earth." ...|$|E

2500|$|Second, a maxim might fail by {{generating}} what Kant calls a ‘contradiction in willing’. (4:424) This sort of contradiction {{comes about}} when the universalized maxim contradicts something that rational agents necessarily will. For example, a person might have a maxim never to help others {{when they are in}} need. However, Kant thinks that all agents necessarily wish for the help of others from time to time. Therefore, it is impossible for the agent to will that her maxim be universally adopted. [...] If an attempt to universalize a maxim results in a contradiction in conception, it violates what Kant calls a perfect duty. If it results in a contradiction in willing, it violates what Kant calls an imperfect duty. Perfect duties are negative duties, that is duties not to commit or engage in certain actions or activities (for example theft). Imperfect duties are positive duties, duties to commit or engage in certain actions or activities (for example, giving to charity). In the Groundwork, Kant says that perfect duties <b>never</b> <b>admit</b> of exception for the sake of inclination (4:421n), which is sometimes taken to imply that imperfect duties do admit of exception for the sake of inclination. However, in a later work (The Metaphysics of Morals), Kant suggests that imperfect duties only allow for flexibility in how one chooses to fulfill them. [...] Kant thinks that we have perfect and imperfect duties both to ourselves and to others.|$|E
