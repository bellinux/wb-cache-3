50|$|As of June 2017, {{for reasons}} unknown, this {{third and final}} series was either <b>never</b> {{actually}} <b>made</b> or <b>never</b> broadcast. There is no reference to why this is.

5|$|According to critics, the {{inherent}} {{problem with this}} approach is that it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted buon fresco, that he was always satisfied with the result {{at the end of the}} day, and that in four and a half years spent on the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and <b>never</b> <b>made</b> small alterations or added details.
