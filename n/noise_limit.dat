Electronic noise (phase noise) and metastability performance of VCO pixels in low cost, widely available a-Si technology will be theoretically calculated and measured {{for the first time in}} this research. The application of a VCO pixel architecture in thin film technologies to large area imaging modalities will be examined and a small prototype a-Si array integrated with an overlying selenium X-ray converter will be demonstrated for the first time. A-Si and poly-Si transistor technologies are traditionally considered inferior in performance to crystalline silicon, the dominant semiconductor technology today. This work v aims to extend the reach of low cost, thin film transistor a-Si technology to high performance analog applications (i. e. very low input referred noise) previously considered only the domain of crystalline silicon type semiconductor.

40|$|Abstractâ€”A {{theory for}} the {{signal-to-noise}} ratio (SNR) of optical direct-detection receivers employing return-to-zero (RZ) coding (and possibly optical preamplification) is developed. The results are valid for both signal-independent <b>noise</b> <b>limited</b> and signal-dependent <b>noise</b> <b>limited</b> receivers, {{as well as}} for arbitrary optical pulse shapes and receive filter characteristics. Even if the same receiver bandwidth is used, RZ coding is seen to perform better than nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) coding. Asymptotic expressions for the SNR in case of very high and very low receiver bandwidths show that the full sensitivity enhancement potential of RZ coding is exhausted at fairly moderate duty cycles. A realistic example taking into account intersymbol interference (ISI) shows that a receiver sensitivity gain (compared to NRZ coding) of, e. g., 3. 2 dB can be obtained in a signal-independent <b>noise</b> <b>limited</b> receiver with a bandwidth of 80 % of the data rate, using a duty cycle of three.

50|$|Compared to 193i SADP, EUV SADP cost is {{dominated}} by the EUV tool exposure, while the 193i SAQP cost difference is from the added depositions and etches. The processing cost and yield loss at a lithographic tool is expected to be highest in the whole integrated process flow due to the need to move the wafer to specific locations at high speed. EUV further suffers from the shot <b>noise</b> <b>limit,</b> which forces the dose to increase going for successive nodes. On the other hand, depositions and etches process entire wafers at once, without the need for wafer stage motion in the process chamber. In fact, multiple layers may be added under the resist layer for anti-reflection or etch hard-mask purposes, just for conventional single exposure.|$|E

At a fixed bit error probability {{the capacity of}} the link is measured as a function of rms signal-to-noise ratio for NRZ-L, Manchester and Miller codes. Two operating regions are observed: (1) <b>noise</b> <b>limited</b> at low values of SNR and (2) band limited at high values of SNR. In the <b>noise</b> <b>limited</b> region doubling the data rate requires a 6 dB increase in SNR; in the band limited region an increase of approximately 12 dB is required to produce the same result. The conclusion is that, for baseband recording of digital data, operation should be in the <b>noise</b> <b>limited</b> region slightly below the transition to the band limited region. If SNR margin is available at this operating point more data per square of tape can be stored by increasing the number of tracks rather than increasing the storage per track. The theoretical penalty of 3. 5 dB for the Miller code bit detector should, and does, result in a data rate decrease to. 67 of the data rate with the NRZ-L code at the same SNR in the <b>noise</b> <b>limited</b> region. For the Manchester code the transition to the band limited region occurs at a lower SNR than for either NRZ-L or Miller codes.
