25|$|In {{contrast}} to the racial jokes and innuendo brought out in its subsequent persistence in early sound film, blackface imagery in The Jazz Singer {{is at the core}} of the film's central theme, an expressive and artistic exploration of the notion of duplicity and ethnic hybridity within American identity. Of the more than seventy examples of blackface in early sound film 1927–53 that I have viewed (including the nine blackface appearances Jolson subsequently made), The Jazz Singer is unique in that it is the only film where blackface is central to the <b>narrative</b> <b>development</b> and thematic expression.|$|E

The related media included plans for a graphic novel called Overwatch: First Strike, which would have focused on the story of several in-game characters including Soldier: 76, Torbjörn, Reaper, and Reinhardt. The novel was to be penned by writer Micky Neilson and artist Ludo Lullabi. Blizzard opted to cancel First Strike in November 2016, with Chu stating that since the announcement of the graphic novel, Overwatchs <b>narrative</b> <b>development</b> has gone in a somewhat different direction, changing out these origin stories would work.

500|$|F.Vance Neill {{sees the}} book as a [...] "critique of the {{disintegration}} of community", in which the characters are self-absorbed; each, as Wolk sees it, [...] "believe that they're its hero". [...] To Neill, Hernandez underlines this in the closing sequence in which he [...] "shuts down <b>narrative</b> <b>development</b> and isolates each character to one panel apiece", an ending that [...] "indicates a shattering {{of the relationships between}} people" [...] and [...] "reiterates the importance of the values of , acceptance of identity, integrity, the normalcy of the supernatural, and the sanctity of secrets". [...] Wolk interprets this ending in the context of quickly shifting scenes {{of the rest of the}} work—that it requires readers to slow down and think about the sequence of events and their contexts and interrelations.|$|E
500|$|Following Hennig's {{departure}} from Naughty Dog in March 2014, {{it was announced}} that Druckmann and Straley were working on [...] (2016) as creative director and game director, respectively. Initial reports claimed that Hennig was [...] "forced out" [...] of Naughty Dog by Druckmann and Straley, though co-presidents Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra later denied this. Druckmann co-wrote the story alongside Josh Scherr; Druckmann considered Scherr the [...] "funny one", allowing him to write the humour of Uncharted 4 due to Druckmann's self-professed inability to write jokes. He appreciated the collaboration of writing on Uncharted 4, having written The Last of Us almost entirely independently. The game was released on May 10, 2016 to critical acclaim, with continued praise directed towards the story. It was awarded Best Narrative at The Game Awards 2016, and Outstanding Achievement in Videogame Writing at the 69th Writers Guild of America Awards.

500|$|The film shows novel {{techniques}} in film production {{that were used}} to assist the viewer in understanding the narrative. In the beginning of the film, when Harry and the thief struggle, a closeup shot is used to show the thief placing the purse into Harry's pocket. While the two struggle in the previous scene, the close-up shot has both men standing still. Charlie Keil, author of Early American Cinema in Transition, cites this as an attempt to improve the narrative by allowing a complex sequence of events to be examined intelligibly by the viewer. Keil also states that shot may have been done to lessen trade press objections to the close-up views by showing the value to the <b>narrative</b> <b>development.</b> When Harry is in jail, he imagines his mother, and this is shown by an inset at the upper right of film. Months after the film had been released, Robert Grau wrote a column in the Moving Picture World which praised the attention to detail in the production for a newspaper which was shown on camera for only a few seconds. Grau states, [...] "I was unable to discern in the few seconds the effect was on view, what means were taken to create the illusion ... and it is consoling to know that the producers of photoplays are aspiring to reach great heights in such matters." [...] An analysis of the frame shows that it was not so much an illusion as pasting the headline on the edition of August 27, 1910 of the New York City Herald Tribune. The film also shows a real and dangerous stunt executed by Crane, where he is seen [...] "sliding 40 feet down a washline to liberty in a scene that couldn't have been faked." ...|$|E

We present a novel approach to human behavior simulation based on a thorough representation of end-user activities by means of events – computational constructs that simulate users’ individual and group activities to achieve a specific goal. Human behavior narratives result from a combination of top-down (planned) and bottom-up (unplanned) sequences of events, as a reaction to timebased schedules and to social and environmental stimuli, respectively.

2500|$|Rick Berman {{originally}} pictured {{that the}} Dominion War would {{last for a}} limited number of episodes before a prompt resolution. Planning the arc, Ira Steven Behr, Ronald D.

40|$|It is {{traditionally}} thought {{that during the}} first ten years in which permanent cinemas became established in Britain, the accompaniment to silent films was typically supplied by lone pianists who improvised musical themes that subserviently complemented <b>narrative</b> <b>developments</b> as they unfolded on screen.

But it argues that such practices quickly fell out of fashion.

40|$|The rise {{of private}} standards, {{including}} those involving multi-stakeholder processes, {{raises questions about}} whose interests are served {{and the kind of}} power that is exerted to maintain these interests. This paper critically examines the battle for ideas-the way competing factions assert their own narratives about value chain relations, the role of standards and related multi-stakeholder processes. Drawing on empirical research on the horticulture and floriculture value chains linking Kenya and the United Kingdom, the analysis explores the framing of sustainability issues, especially around labor issues and good agricultural practice, and the choice of response with respect to private standards and multi-stakeholder initiatives since the late 1990 s. We identify four competing narratives currently in play: a dominant global sourcing <b>narrative,</b> a pragmatic <b>development</b> <b>narrative,</b> a broader <b>development</b> <b>narrative</b> and a narrative we term potentially transformative. This last narrative is currently emerging through the unpacking of narratives in relation to the framing of sustainability problems and solutions, and in terms of legislative, executive and judicial governance. The paper contributes to emerging understanding of power in value chains, moving beyond material power to a consideration of how ideational power is exerted and resisted...|$|R
