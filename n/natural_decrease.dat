40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with structural and content features of common-sense beliefs about causal processes in nature. It {{is an attempt to}} replicate findings reported by White (1992) using a different method, causal network analysis. Subjects judged the presence and direction of causal relations among a set of entities describing various human, plant and animal parameters. Structurally, the resultant network was linear. In terms of content, human parameters tended to be dominant overall, and plant parameters tended to dominate animal parameters. Both these results replicate White's findings. Results also showed a degree of antagonism between the human and natural worlds: human increases were judged to lead to <b>natural</b> <b>decreases</b> and vice versa; on the other hand, both <b>natural</b> increases and <b>decreases</b> lead to human increases.

If q is a constant value, the <b>natural</b> frequency <b>decreases</b> as the value of L/R increases. The downtrend of natural frequency is much obvious when L/R ratio {{is less than a}} certain extent and when L/R increases to the value, the curve of natural frequency gradually flattens out.

The natural frequency is studied for composite material strengthen by powder, and short fibers with the effect of crack size and position, plate thickness, aspect ratio, the type of plate fixing where three type of fixing used (SSSS, SSCC, SSFF). Two methods are used to find the natural frequency of composite plate: First method is supposed analytical solution to solve the equation of motion considering the effect of size, and position crack on the natural frequency of the composite plate.
