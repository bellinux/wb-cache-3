5|$|The Swastika Flag {{was to be}} used as {{a symbol}} to {{represent}} not only the <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>movement,</b> but also the unity of the Nordic-Germanic peoples into a single state. The swastika was seen by many National Socialists as a fundamentally Germanic and European symbol despite its presence among many cultures worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In early April 1941, Hitler {{had agreed}} to the {{creation}} of the SS-Freiwilligenstandarte Nordwest (SS Volunteer Regiment Northwest), with an authorised strength of 2,500 men recruited from Flanders and the Netherlands. This formation capitalised on the push for an autonomous Flemish-Dutch region within the Reich. Significant proponents of such a union were Anton Mussert of the <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Movement</b> in the Netherlands and Staf De Clercq of the Flemish National League. In this, Berger was exploiting Mussert and De Clerq, because he was actually working towards Hitler's idea of incorporating Flanders and Wallonia into the Reich as two Gaue, not a unified autonomous entity.|$|E
5|$|Louise {{inspired}} {{the establishment of}} a conservative women's organization known as Königin-Luise-Bund, often shortened to Luisenbund ("Queen Louise League") in which her person achieved an almost cult-like status. The group's main purpose was to promote patriotic feelings among German women, and it emphasized the family and German morality. The Königin-Luise-Bund was active {{during the time of the}} Weimar Republic and the first years of the Third Reich. Despite having actively supported the <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>movement</b> since its early stages all through their accession to power in 1933, the Queen Louise League was nonetheless disbanded by the Nazis in 1934, as they viewed it as a hostile organization.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there have}} been {{persistent}} claims of betrayal by an informant, {{the source of the}} information that led the authorities to raid the Achterhuis has never been identified. Night watchman Martin Sleegers and an unidentified police officer investigated a burglary at the premises in April 1944 and came across the bookcase concealing the secret door. Tonny Ahlers, a member of the <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Movement</b> in the Netherlands (NSB), was suspected of being the informant by Carol Ann Lee, biographer of Otto Frank. Another suspect is stockroom manager Willem van Maaren. The Annex occupants did not trust him, as he seemed inquisitive regarding people entering the stockroom after hours. He once unexpectedly asked the employees whether there had previously been a Mr. Frank at the office. Lena Hartog was suspected of being the informant by Anne Frank's biographer Melissa Müller. Several of these suspects knew one another and might have worked in collaboration. While virtually everyone connected with the betrayal was interrogated after the war, no one was definitively identified as being the informant.|$|E
25|$|In the Americas, the Brazilian Integralists led by Plínio Salgado {{claimed as}} many as 200,000 members {{although}} following coup attempts it faced a crackdown from the Estado Novo of Getúlio Vargas in 1937. In the 1930s, the <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Movement</b> of Chile gained seats in Chile's parliament and attempted a coup d'état {{that resulted in the}} Seguro Obrero massacre of 1938.|$|E

Hitler himself understandably disliked this book, which was banned. Sebottendorf was arrested, but somehow escaped (presumably due to some friendship from his Munich days) and in 1934 {{returned to}} Turkey.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{this set}} back the NDP was {{established}} officially in 1966 before the NF although critics, particularly {{from within the}} NF, argued that Brown only did so as he could not stand the prospect of serving under A.

25|$|The Dutch word is kameraad. In Common Dutch {{the word}} is mostly {{reminiscent}} of communists, whereas in informal speech and dialects {{it can be used}} to indicate friends or acquaintances. It was used as a form of address in the Communist Party of the Netherlands, as well as in the pre-war <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Movement</b> in the Netherlands, the latter also using the female neologism kameraadske. The pseudo-Russian word kameraadski is used informally as a sobriquet for a person with leftist sympathies.|$|E
25|$|On October 15, 2005, White {{helped the}} <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Movement</b> {{organize}} a march and rally in Toledo, Ohio. The march was canceled by police when the NSM and around 20 supporters were outnumbered by several hundred anti-racists {{and members of}} the largely African-American neighborhood in which the rally was to take place. White, the NSM's Dayton leader Mark Martin, and the rest of their supporters taunted the crowd with racial epithets. Some counter-protesters became violent and began rioting. More than 100 people were arrested.|$|E
25|$|Tyndall {{was to be}} {{the leader}} of this new party, with the {{majority}} of its members coming from the NNF, although others were defectors from the NF, British Movement, British Democratic Party, and Nationalist Party. The party was formerly launched at a press conference held in a Victoria hotel on 7 April 1982. It was therefore dominated by ex-NF members and inherited that party's tradition of racial nationalism. Tyndall had led the NF on two occasions, and prior to that had been involved in several Neo-Nazi groups, having been involved in the <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Movement</b> during the early 1960s and then founded his own Greater Britain Movement in 1964.|$|E
5000|$|From {{an early}} age Gripenberg had a disdain for egalitarian thought and {{parliamentary}} democracy, and participated on the White side in the Finnish Civil War. His 1918 poem [...] "Den drömda armén" [...] ("the dreamed army") has been interpreted as a prediction of the Winter War. He joined the Lapua Movement but looked down on the Fascist and <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>movements</b> which he found to be plebeian. He participated in the Peasant March to Helsinki {{in the summer of}} 1930, but after that rarely took part in any public political activity.|$|R
50|$|In 1924, Brückner {{joined the}} <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> Freedom <b>Movement</b> (the NSDAP had been banned after the failed “Beer Hall Putsch” in 1923) and became editor of Schlesien Volksstimme. He also became Stadtverordneter in Breslau, a {{position}} he held until 1926.|$|R
50|$|Hitler {{used the}} time in Landsberg Prison to {{consider}} his political strategy and dictate {{the first volume of}} Mein Kampf (My Struggle; originally entitled Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice), principally to his deputy Rudolf Hess. After the putsch the party was banned in Bavaria, but it participated in 1924's two elections by proxy as the <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> Freedom <b>Movement.</b> In the German election, May 1924 the party gained seats in the Reichstag, with 6.55% (1,918,329) voting for the Movement. In the German election, December 1924 the <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> Freedom <b>Movement</b> (NSFB) (Combination of the Deutschvölkische Freiheitspartei (DVFP) and the Nazi Party (NSDAP)) lost 18 seats, only holding on to 14 seats, with 3% (907,242) of the electorate voting for Hitler's party.|$|R
25|$|In 1923, {{after the}} failed Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler, {{who had been}} imprisoned for treason, {{appointed}} Rosenberg {{as the leader of}} the <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>movement,</b> a position he held until Hitler's release. Hitler remarked privately in later years that his choice of Rosenberg, whom he regarded as weak and lazy, was strategic; Hitler did not want the temporary leader of the Nazis to become too popular or hungry for power, because a person with either of those two qualities might not want to cede the party leadership after Hitler's release. However, at the time of the appointment Hitler had no reason to believe that he would soon be released, and Rosenberg had not appeared weak, so this may have been Hitler reading back into history his dissatisfaction with Rosenberg for the job he did.|$|E
500|$|Hergé {{named the}} Bordurian {{political}} leader [...] "Müsstler" [...] from the surnames of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and Italy's National Fascist leader Benito Mussolini.

500|$|According to the British {{historian}} Simon Schama the Batavian Republic {{has been}} controversially treated by historians. After {{the end of}} the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands during World War II there were some [...] who saw a historical parallel between the Dutch <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Movement</b> (NSB) and the Patriot revolutionaries, while they pictured William V in the heroic role of Queen Wilhelmina and her government-in-exile. Dutch historian Pieter Geyl opposed such comparisons in his Patriotten en NSBers: een historische parallel (1946).|$|E
5000|$|The party {{denies that}} it has any {{official}} connection to Neo-Nazism. Although it uses the Roman salute, a salute used by the Italian Fascist and German <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>movements,</b> it claims to draw its inspiration in this primarily from the 4th of August Regime established by Ioannis Metaxas, the Greek nationalist leader and dictator, whose National Youth Organization (and later, his entire government) adopted upon taking power. Ioannis Metaxas was the dictator of Greece from 1936 to 1940, when an invasion by the Axis Powers defeated his regime after he refused to surrender. Ohi Day, or [...] "No Day", the anniversary of Metaxas' refusal to accept Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini's demand for surrender, is celebrated annually in Greece [...]|$|R

500|$|Several {{biographies of}} Hans-Joachim Marseille {{have written about}} his disdain for {{authority}} and for the <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>movement</b> in general. Some biographers describe him as [...] "openly anti-Nazi." [...] When Marseille first met Hitler in 1942 he did not form a positive impression. After returning to Africa, Eduard Neumman recalled, [...] "After his first visit with Hitler, Marseille returned {{and said that he}} thought 'the Führer was a rather odd sort'." [...] On the visit, Marseille also said some unflattering things about Hitler and the Nazi Party. Several senior officers, which included Adolf Galland and Nicolaus von Below, overheard his remarks during one of the award ceremonies. Von Below asked Marseille if he would join the Nazi Party and within earshot of others, Marseille responded, [...] "that if he saw a party worth joining, he would consider it, but there would have to plenty of attractive women in it." [...] The remarks visibly upset Hitler who was left [...] "puzzled" [...] by his behaviour.|$|E
500|$|Born in Devon {{and educated}} in Kent, Tyndall {{undertook}} national service prior to embracing the extreme-right. In the mid-1950s, {{he joined the}} League of Empire Loyalists (LEL) and came {{under the influence of}} its leader, Arthur Chesterton. Finding the LEL too moderate, in 1957 he and John Bean founded the National Labour Party (NLP), an explicitly [...] "National Socialist" [...] (Nazi) group. In 1960, the NLP merged with Colin Jordan's White Defence League to found the first British National Party (BNP), with Tyndall and Jordan establishing a paramilitary wing called Spearhead. Bean and other BNP members were unhappy with this and expelled Tyndall and Jordan, who went on to establish the <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Movement</b> and then the wider World Union of National Socialists. In 1962, they were convicted and imprisoned for their paramilitary activities. After a split with Jordan, Tyndall formed his Greater Britain Movement (GBM) in 1964. Although never changing his basic beliefs, by the mid-1960s, Tyndall was replacing his overt references to Nazism with appeals to British nationalism.|$|E
500|$|The real {{identity}} of [...] "Anton Long" [...] {{remains a mystery}} to both members of the Order and to academics who have studied it. However, in a 1998 issue of the anti-fascist magazine Searchlight, it was claimed that [...] "Anton Long" [...] was a pseudonym of David Myatt, a prominent figure in the British Neo-Nazi movement. Born in the early 1950s, Myatt {{had been involved in}} various Neo-Nazi groups, initially serving as a bodyguard for Colin Jordan of the British Movement before joining the Combat 18 militia and becoming a founding member and leader of the <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Movement.</b> His text on A Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution, in which he advocated violent militancy in aid of the Neo-Nazi cause, was cited as an influence on the nail bomber David Copeland. In 1998 Myatt converted to Islam and remained a practicing Muslim for eight years, in which time he encouraged violent jihad against Zionism and Israel's Western allies. In 2010, he announced that he had renounced Islam and was practicing an esoteric tradition that he termed the [...] "Numinous Way".|$|E
50|$|Authoritarian {{conservatism}} {{refers to}} autocratic regimes that center their ideology around conservative nationalism rather than ethnic nationalism, though certain racial components such as antisemitism may exist. Authoritarian conservative movements show strong devotion towards religion, tradition, and culture, while also expressing fervent nationalism akin to other far-right nationalist movements. Examples of authoritarian conservative leaders include António de Oliveira Salazar and Engelbert Dollfuss. Authoritarian conservative movements were {{prominent in the}} same era as fascism, with which it sometimes clashed. Although both ideologies shared core values such as nationalism and had common enemies such as communism and materialism, there was nonetheless a contrast between the traditionalist nature of authoritarian conservatism and the revolutionary, palingenetic, and populist nature of fascism; thus, it was common for authoritarian conservative regimes to suppress rising fascist and <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>movements.</b> The hostility between the two ideologies is highlighted by the struggle for power for the <b>National</b> <b>Socialists</b> in Austria, which was marked by the assassination of Dollfuss.|$|R
50|$|Belgium {{was again}} {{occupied}} by the Germans during World War II, and the Nazis tried to unite all youth-organisations in one <b>national</b> <b>socialist</b> youth <b>movement.</b> Scouting meetings and camps were banned, however some underground activities were conducted. Scouting resumed after the liberation. BSB and GGB merged into one organization in July 1945. Each section remained separate, {{and there were no}} mixed groups until well into the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|After the Nazi Party {{was banned}} in 1924, the DVFP merged with many Nazis {{to form the}} <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> Freedom <b>Movement,</b> a move {{endorsed}} by Erich Ludendorff and encouraged by Graefe, who hoped {{to gain control of}} the far right as a whole. However this alliance was not a success and thus Graefe and Wulle reformed the DVFP as a rival to the Nazi Party in 1925.|$|R
500|$|Tyndall and Jordan then regrouped around twenty {{members of}} Spearhead and formed the <b>National</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Movement</b> (NSM) on 20 April 1962, a date symbolically {{chosen as the}} anniversary of Hitler's birthday. They celebrated the event with a cake {{decorated}} with a Nazi swastika. According to the historian Richard Thurlow, the NSM was [...] "the most blatant Nazi" [...] group active in Britain during the mid-20th century. The NSM gained few members; an estimate in August 1962 suggested that it had only thirty to fifty. The NSM gained {{the attention of the}} media as well as Special Branch. In July 1962, Tyndall was arrested for breaching the peace at a Trafalgar Square rally in which he had been attacked by Jewish military veterans and other anti-fascists after calling the Jewish community a [...] "poisonous maggot feeding on a body in an advanced state of decay". His comments resulted in him being convicted of inciting racial hatred and he was sentenced to six weeks imprisonment, reduced to a fine on appeal. The police then raided the group's London headquarters, after which its leading members were brought to trial at the Old Bailey, where they were found guilty of establishing a paramilitary group in contravention of Section Two of the Public Order Act 1936. Tyndall received a six-month prison sentence, while Jordan received nine months.|$|E
