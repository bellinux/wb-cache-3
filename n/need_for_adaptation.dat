50|$|Although {{national}} governments {{and local authorities}} are taking stringent mitigation measures, the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>adaptation</b> {{is in the interest}} of dealing with climate change because carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for decades and is trapped in oceans for centuries, thereby resulting in a change in ocean chemistry and may adversely affect ocean life. No matter how much humanity cuts greenhouse gas emissions now, the emissions released now will have an impact for decades. Therefore, adaptation is crucial for cities looking towards strengthening their resistance against the climate impact that past emissions have caused - to deal with the problems caused by greenhouse gas emissions pumped out years ago.|$|E

40|$|Adaptive {{capacity}} {{is the ability}} of a living system, such as a social&# 8211;ecological system, to adjust responses to changing internal demands and external drivers. Although adaptive {{capacity is}} a frequent topic of study in the resilience literature, there are few formal models. This paper introduces such a model and uses it to explore adaptive capacity by contrast with the opposite condition, or traps. In a social&# 8211;ecological rigidity trap, strong self-reinforcing controls prevent the flexibility <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>adaptation.</b> In the model, too much control erodes adaptive capacity and thereby increases the risk of catastrophic breakdown. In a social&# 8211;ecological poverty trap, loose connections prevent the mobilization of ideas and resources to solve problems. In the model, too little control impedes the focus <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>adaptation.</b> Fluctuations of internal demand or external shocks generate pulses of adaptive capacity, which may gain traction and pull the system out of the poverty trap. The model suggests some general properties of traps in social&# 8211;ecological systems. It is general and flexible, so it {{can be used as a}} building block in more specific and detailed models of adaptive capacity for a particular region...|$|R
50|$|Technological {{change and}} {{scientific}} processes {{play an important}} role through research, inspiring the creation, distribution and exploitation of knowledge. These scientific advances improve technological innovation for climate change mitigation. They are vital to use in strategizing methods to adaptation, being necessary while climate change threatens the world. Presently national technology systems focus on growth in jobs and output, instead of reducing greenhouse gas emissions or increasing energy efficiency. Adaptation strategies are meant to reduce any vulnerability of available technologies and the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>adaptation</b> at all with scientific technologies including energy efficiency improvements, and production of renewable energy (RE), nuclear power/energy (NE), and carbon capture storage (CCS).|$|E
5000|$|The term Design for All (DfA) {{is used to}} {{describe}} a design philosophy targeting the use of products, services and systems by {{as many people as}} possible without the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>adaptation.</b> [...] "Design for All is design for human diversity, social inclusion and equality" [...] (EIDD Stockholm Declaration, 2004). According to the European Commission, it [...] "encourages manufacturers and service providers to produce new technologies for everyone: technologies that are suitable for the elderly and people with disabilities, as much as the teenage techno wizard." [...] The origin of Design for All [...] lies in the field of barrier free accessibility for people with disabilities and the broader notion of universal design.|$|E
50|$|Another {{response}} to climate change, known as {{climate change mitigation}} (Verbruggen, 2007) is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and/or enhance the removal of these gases from the atmosphere (through carbon sinks). Even the most effective reductions in emissions, however, would not prevent further climate change impacts, making the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>adaptation</b> unavoidable (Klein et al., 2007). In a literature assessment, Klein et al. (2007) assessed options for adaptation. They concluded, with very high confidence, that {{in the absence of}} mitigation efforts, the effects of climate change would reach such a magnitude as to make adaptation impossible for some natural ecosystems. Others are concerned that climate adaptation programs might interfere with the existing development programs and thus lead to unintended consequences for vulnerable groups. For human systems, the economic and social costs of unmitigated climate change would be very high.|$|E

50|$|When Indo-Guyanese first arrived, many of {{them did}} not find {{advantageous}} work, despite having high levels of education and skills, {{due to a lack}} of credentials, a <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>adaptation</b> to Canadian society, and racism from existing Canadians. Many of them lived in cramped dwellings and this forced elders into retirement houses; in Guyana the housing spaces are larger and accommodate entire extended families. In addition many Indo-Guyanese who first settled Toronto lived in neighborhoods far away from worship centres, and those centres were often not majority Indo-Guyanese and did sermons in languages not understood by Indo-Guyanese. As of 1990 many Indo-Guyanese were underpaid in relation to their qualifications and skills, and compared with their political situation in their homeland they had not achieved as much political power by 1990.Indo-Guyanese students attended university at rates higher than the Canadian average due to pressure from parents and a cultural commitment to education, although the people had reduced enthusiasm for achieving this education.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept and}} {{language}} of Universal Design for Learning {{was inspired by}} the universal design movement in architecture and product development, originally formulated by Ronald L. Mace at North Carolina State University. Universal design calls for [...] "the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>adaptation</b> or specialized design". UDL applies this general idea to learning: that curriculum should, from the outset, be designed to accommodate all kinds of learners. Educators have to be deliberate in the teaching and learning process in the classroom (e.g Preparing class learning profiles for each student). This will enable grouping by interest. Those students that have challenges will be given special assistance. This will enable specific multimedia {{to meet the needs of}} all students. However, recognizing that the UD principles created to guide the design of things (e.g., buildings, products) are not adequate for the design of social interactions (e.g., human learning environments), researchers at CAST looked to the neurosciences and theories of progressive education in developing the UDL principles. In particular, the work of Lev Vygotsky and, less directly, Benjamin Bloom informed the three-part UDL framework.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Adaptation {{to climate}} change is given increas-ing {{international}} attention as the confidence in climate change projections is getting higher. Developing countries have specific <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> <b>adaptation</b> due to high vulnerabil-ities, and they will in this way carry {{a great part of}} the global costs of climate change although the rising atmo-spheric greenhouse gas concentrations are mainly the responsibility of industrialized countries. This article pro-vides a status of climate change adaptation in developing countries. An overview of observed and projected climate change is given, and recent literature on impacts, vulner-ability, and adaptation are reviewed, including the emerging focus on mainstreaming of climate change and adaptation in development plans and programs. The article also serves as an introduction to the seven research articles of this special issue on climate change adaptation in developing countries. It is concluded that although many useful steps have been taken in the direction of ensuring adequate adaptation in developing countries, much work still remains to fully understand the drivers of past adap-tation efforts, the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> future <b>adaptation,</b> and how to mainstream climate into general development policies...|$|R

50|$|During {{the winter}} period, the {{physical}} environment of T. carnifex will change drastically, and a <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>adaptation</b> to this will arise. The replicatory processes of cells are lowered a great deal during hibernation, likely due to the decrease in metabolic activity and therefore a low need for replication. Cells will exhibit features associated with {{a process known as}} “aging”. This involves dropping elements that are less mature from the circulatory compartment. Aging is assisted by apoptosis (programmed cell death, “cell suicide”). As stated, metabolism is severely lowered during this winter period. This decrease is demonstrated by noticeable changes both in blood circulating cells and haemopoietic cells (these are cells involved in all blood cell production, stem cells found in bone marrow). There are other decreases seen in these cells, and these include enzymatic activity. Because it is necessary for some supplementation of this, the liver increases in activity during this period. It is as if there is a shift in responsibility from the haemopoietic cells to the liver. There is a high correlation between increased activity of the liver and decreased myelopoietic activity. Decrease in metabolic activity could be due to the low motility or movement of newts during winter. Cold temperatures seem to slow down their system.|$|E
5000|$|Humanistic naturalism is {{the branch}} of {{philosophical}} naturalism wherein human beings are best able to control and understand the world through use of the scientific method, combined with the social and ethical values of humanism. Concepts of spirituality, intuition, and metaphysics are considered subjectively valuable only, primarily because they are unfalsifiable, and therefore can never progress {{beyond the realm of}} personal opinion. A boundary is not drawn between nature and what lies [...] "beyond" [...] nature; everything is regarded as a result of explainable processes within nature, with nothing lying outside of it. [...] The belief is that all living things are intricate extensions of nature, and therefore deserve some degree of mutual respect from human beings. Naturalists accept the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>adaptation</b> to current change, however it may be, and also that life must feed upon life for survival. However, they also recognize the necessity for a fair exchange of resources between all species. Humanistic naturalists are generally concerned with the ethical aspects of [...] "worldview naturalism." [...] Industry and technology are sometimes regarded as enemies to naturalism, but this is not always the case. For those who do believe in such threats, the thought is that the majority of human history, societies were largely agricultural and hunter-gatherer and lived in relative harmony and balance with nature. With the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, some humanistic naturalists see this balance as being increasingly threatened. This view has some similarities with anarcho-primitivism and other anti-modernist perspectives.|$|E
5000|$|Many of the {{features}} seen in known hupehsuchian specimens that are {{comparable to those of}} more well known diapsids may not necessarily be evidence of ancestry or relationship. The lower jaw and rostrum of hupehsuchians have been compared to many other secondarily aquatic tetrapods such as plesiosaurs, whales, and the early marine bird Hesperornis, all of which have developed a similar morphology independently in response to the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>adaptation</b> to a marine environment. [...] Classification of Hupehsuchia remains difficult because most of the derived characters exhibited in the clade that can be helpful in phylogenetic analyses are also present in other unrelated groups of secondarily aquatic reptiles, and the overall record of diapsids during the Late Permian-Early Triassic is relatively poor, making it difficult to find any closely related or ancestral taxa. Even higher level classification is difficult because many of the plesiomorphies that characterize such groups are absent in the highly derived, marine adapted hupehsuchians. For example, several characteristics suggest that Hupehsuchia belongs within Neodiapsida, but most of the derived characteristics that define the clade are absent or hard to distinguish in hupehsuchians, even though their ancestors may have possessed these characteristics at one point. Three derived characteristics of Neodiapsida are a reduced number of teeth on the pterygoid, an absence of teeth on the parasphenoid, and a lack of caniniform mixillary teeth, but none of these apply to hupehsuchians because they lack teeth altogether. Many derived characteristics that define neodiapsids regard the limbs and girdles, but these characteristics are not seen in marine reptiles because the limbs and girdles are too highly modified. Many characteristics of the skull cannot be seen in hupehsuchians due to poor preservation of remains. Therefore, any placement of Hupehsuchia within Neodiapsida remains tentative until more specimens are found.|$|E
