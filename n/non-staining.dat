5|$|There {{are a few}} greenish Stropharia {{with which}} S.caerulea might be confused. Stropharia pseudocyanea is an {{uncommon}} species that grows in meadows. It has a more slender form than S.caerulea, a soft, spongy stipe, and flesh with an odour similar to fresh pepper. Microscopically, it has a dense palisade of slender, capitate (with a spherical tip) <b>non-staining</b> cheilocystidia on the gill edge. This gives the gills of young, fresh fruit bodies a whitish edge, a feature that is absent from S.caerulea. Another lookalike, S.aeruginosa, is less common than S.caerulea. It is distinguished from the latter by the well-developed ring zone on its stipe, darker gills with white edges, and more numerous whitish scales around the cap margin. Additionally, S.aeruginosa has more stable colours than S.caerulea, the colouration of which tends to quickly wash out. However, collections of Stropharia often show characteristics that are intermediate between two or more species, making them difficult to identify accurately.|$|E

40|$|The present work {{describes}} a novel imaging technique for label-free no-UV vibration-insensitive imaging of live cells in an epi-illumination geometry. This technique {{can be implemented}} {{in a variety of}} imaging applications. For example, it can be used for cell targeting {{as a part of a}} platform for targeted cell irradiations - single-cell microbeam. The goal of microbeam facilities is to provide biological researchers with tools to study the effects of ionizing radiation on live cells. A common way of cell labeling - fluorescent staining - may alter cellular metabolism and UV illumination presents potential damage for the genetic material. The new imaging technique will allow the researchers to separate radiation-induced effects from the effects caused by confounding factors like fluorescent staining or UV light. Geometry of irradiation endstations at some microbeam facilities precludes the use of transmitted light, e. g. in the Columbia University's Radiological Research Accelerator Facility microbeam endstation, where the ion beam exit window is located just below the sample. Imaging techniques used at such endstations must use epi-illumination. Mirau Interferometry is an epi-illumination, <b>non-stain</b> imaging modality suitable for implementation at a microbeam endstation. To facilitate interferometry and to maintain cell viability, it is desirable that cells stay in cell growth medium during the course of an experiment. To accommodate the use of medium, Immersion Mirau Interferometry has been developed. A custom attachment for a microscope objective has been designed and built for interferometric imaging with the possibility of immersion of the apparatus into cell medium. The implemented data collection algorithm is based on the principles of Phase-Shifting Interferometry. The largest limitation of Phase-Shifting Interferometry is its sensitivity to the vertical position of the sample. In environments where vibration isolation is difficult, this makes image acquisition challenging. This problem was resolved by integration of polarization optics into the optics of the attachment to enable simultaneous creation and spatial separation of two interferograms, which, combined with the background image, are used to reconstruct the intensity map of the specimen. Giving the name Simultaneous Immersion Mirau Interferometry to this approach, simultaneous acquisition of all interferograms per image has eliminated the issue of vibrations. The designed compound microscope attachment has been manufactured and tested; the system produces images of quality, sufficient to perform targeted cellular irradiation experiments...|$|R

50|$|Adding {{coloured}} dye {{to bubble}} mixtures fails to produce coloured bubbles, because the dye {{attaches to the}} water molecules {{as opposed to the}} surfactant.

50|$|Lamellar phase refers {{generally}} to packing of polar-headed long chain nonpolar-tail molecules {{in an environment}} of bulk polar liquid, as sheets of bilayers separated by bulk liquid. In biophysics, polar lipids (mostly, phospholipids, and rarely, glycolipids) pack as a liquid crystalline bilayer, with hydrophobic fatty acyl long chains directed inwardly and polar headgroups of lipids aligned on the outside in contact with water, as a 2-dimensional flat sheet surface. Under transmission electron microscope (TEM), after staining with polar headgroup reactive chemical osmium tetroxide, lamellar lipid phase appears as two thin parallel dark staining lines/sheets, constituted by aligned polar headgroups of lipids.

While LZPt- 2 and - 3 clones generated well-staining primary tumours, LZPt- 1 cells yielded many <b>non-staining</b> tumours, indicating greater instability of lacZ expression for this clone in situ (stability of lacZ expression in culture was similar for all three clones). After s. c. or intradermal injections, tumour cells were tracked for 1 h to > 3 weeks (palpable) to evaluate the topology and population expansion characteristics at the earliest times. From 1 h to 2 days, tumour cells were concentrated in central masses with 'crinkly hair' distributions emanating from the periphery. Between 3 and 7 days, these 'crinkly hair' patterns were cleared from the tissue, leaving dense ovoid patterns of tumour cells. These concentrations of cells expanded collectively, not by division of {{one or a few}} cells, but by division of many cells. For clone LZPt- 1, cells stained well with X-gal for 2 - 3 days; by 7 days, most cells were <b>non-staining.</b> Evidence suggests that lacZ expression is turned off in these tumour cells, rather than a lacZ- cell type clonally dominating the population. For all three clones, tumour cells remained rounded and did not spread in any tissue environment at all time points, indicating very different matrix adhesion mechanisms operating in situ compared with their distinctive spreading patterns in culture. Angioneogenesis near primary tumours became evident by 2 - 3 days, leading to extensive vascularisation by 1 - 2 weeks.

Further fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using 45 S rDNA as a probe indicated that the root-tip cells having more than a 14 chromosome plus chromosome fragment count were a result of chromosome breakage or gap formation in vitro (referred to as chromosome lesions) at 45 S rDNA sites, and 86 % of the cells exhibited chromosome breaks or gaps and all occurred at the sites of 45 S rDNA in Lolium perenne L. cv. Player, as well as in L. multiflorum Lam. cv. Top One. Chromatin depletion or decondensation occurred at various locations within the 45 S rDNA regions, suggesting heterogeneity of lesions of 45 S rDNA sites with respect to their position within the rDNA region. Conclusions: The chromosome lesions observed in this study are very similar cytologically to that of fragile sites observed i...|$|E
