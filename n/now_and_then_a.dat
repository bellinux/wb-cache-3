25|$|A few {{faithful}} Jews {{succeeded in}} making their escape. The synagogue had been ruined several years before, and though <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> Jew settled on the islands, there came to be practically no Jews there. The Catholic Monarchs passed the Alhambra Decree expelling Jews from Spain, and the Spanish Inquisition began its work. In 1506, twenty-two Jews, condemned, though either dead or absent, were burned in effigy; again, in 1509 and 1510, some Jews were publicly burned in effigy; and in 1511 sixty-two Jews who had escaped from the Inquisition were punished in the same way.|$|E
25|$|Most books either receive {{immediate}} {{attention in the}} market, or fail. The successful sell most of their copies {{within a year or}} two of publication. <b>Now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> book sells well and continues to sell for many years. The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were drastic exceptions to both patterns. Both works sold enough to induce the publishers to continue printing, but for the first twenty-five years of The Hobbit's life, and the first ten years of that of The Lord of the Rings, sales {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic amounted to little more than a few thousand copies per year. It was not until the mid-1960s that social trends flowered into an acceptance and even hunger for the modern fantasy, which Tolkien had developed so long before almost on his own. Formerly an obscure author, Tolkien exploded into popularity. Despite the fact that The Hobbit had already gone through fifteen printing runs and two distinct editions by then, suddenly all of them were collectible. By that time, printing presses were churning out more copies every year than had been sold those first twenty-five.|$|E
25|$|In Great Britain, April, May and June {{specimens}} {{have the}} veins tinged with grey and rather distinct, {{but are not}} so strongly marked with black as those belonging to the second flight, which occurs in late July and throughout August. This seasonal variation, as it is called, is also most clearly exhibited on the underside. In the May and June butterfly (plate 13, left side) the veins below are greenish grey, {{and those of the}} hindwings are broadly bordered also with this colour. In the bulk of the July and August specimens (plate 13, right side) only the nervures are shaded with greenish grey, and the nervures are only faintly, or not at all, marked with this colour. <b>Now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> specimen of the first brood may assume the characters properly belonging to the specimens of the second brood; and, on the other hand, a butterfly of the second brood may closely resemble one of the first brood. As a rule, however, the seasonal differences referred to are fairly constant. By rearing this species from the egg it has been ascertained that part (sometimes the smaller) of a brood from eggs laid in June attains the butterfly stage the same year, and the other part remains in the chrysalis until the following spring, the butterflies in each set being of the form proper to the time of emergence.|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} mostly {{consists of}} reading {{and listening to the}} conversations provided. Every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Please Select Your Destiny" [...] event will occur, giving the player multiple choices on how to respond. The choices selected determine who will be Rin's destined love; depending on which route the player takes, there will be between 8 and 12 multiple-choice questions. At a certain point in the visual novel, a translucent image of the destined character appears when the day changes indicating who Rin has fallen in love with after which the multiple-choice events become almost nonexistent. Near the end of the game, two sex scenes will occur. After some more conversation the visual novel ends. After the visual novel has been completed at least once, players can view CG (computer graphics) artwork they have observed, skip to scenes or endings for characters they have viewed, and listen to music they have heard in the game.|$|E
500|$|The {{libretto}} {{has been}} praised by several biographers and historians. One said that [...] "The dialogue contains many an authentic Gilbertian touch." [...] Another found it [...] "a gay, sparkling libretto". Sidney Dark and Rowland Gray wrote that [...] "the book of Thespis is genuine Gilbert, the Gilbert whom nowadays {{all the world}} loves.... Thespis once more emphasizes the fact that Gilbert's artistry was hardly affected {{with the passing of}} the years. Many of its songs might well have appeared in the later operas." [...] They point out Mercury's [...] "I'm the celestial drudge", which anticipates Giuseppe's [...] "Rising early in the morning" [...] in The Gondoliers, and find the [...] "real brand of Gilbertian topsy-turvydom" [...] in the song about the former head of a railway company, [...] "I once knew a chap who discharged a function". Isaac Goldberg thought that [...] "Thespis looks forward far more often than it glances backward: [...] "It forecasts the characteristic methods, and <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> character, of the later series. Its dialogue is comical, and, if anything, somewhat above the heads of the Gaiety audiences of 1871." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{within the}} LDS Church, {{particularly}} Smith's contemporaries, have expressed {{the view that}} the endowment was given anciently by God in its original form at the Temple of Solomon, but that the form of the ritual degenerated into the form used by Freemasons.

2500|$|The overall gloominess of A Song of Ice and Fire {{can be an}} {{obstacle}} for some readers; the Inchoatus Group writes that, [...] "If this absence of joy is going to trouble you, or you're looking for something more affirming, then you should probably seek elsewhere." [...] However, for many fans, {{it is precisely this}} level of [...] "realness" [...] and [...] "completeness"–including many characters' imperfections, moral and ethical ambiguity, and (often sudden) consequential plot twists–that is endearing about Martin's work. Many find that this is what makes the series' story arcs compelling enough to keep following despite its sheer brutality and intricately messy and interwoven plotlines; as TM Wagner points out: There's great tragedy here, but there's also excitement, humor, heroism even in weaklings, nobility even in villains, and, <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>a</b> taste of justice after all. It's a rare gift when a writer can invest his story with that much humanity.Martin's characters are multifaceted, each with intricate pasts, aspirations, and ambitions. Publishers Weekly writes of his ongoing epic fantasy A Song of Ice and Fire: [...] "The complexity of characters such as Daenerys, Arya and the Kingslayer will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like Tolkien or Jordan, makes us care about their fates." [...] Misfortune, injury, and death (including false death and reanimation) often befall major or minor characters, no matter how attached the reader has become. Martin has described his penchant for killing off important characters as being necessary for the story's depth: [...] "when my characters are in danger, I want you to be afraid to turn the page, (so) you need to show right from the beginning that you're playing for keeps".|$|E
