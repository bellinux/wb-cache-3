Warren, a judge in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Because of the sensitive <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> at stake in the trial, two separate hearings were conducted, one in public, and the other in camera. The defendants, Morland and the editors of The Progressive, would not accept security clearances, which would put restraints on their free speech, and so were not present at the in camera hearings. Their lawyers did obtain clearances so that they could participate, but were forbidden from conveying anything they heard there to their clients.|$|E

2500|$|The {{paucity of}} {{concrete}} prescriptions to {{be derived from}} hadith and the contradictory <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about the actions of early authorities resulted in lack of agreement among classical jurists as to how homosexual activity should be treated. Most legal schools treat homosexual intercourse with penetration similarly to unlawful heterosexual intercourse under the rubric of zina, but there are differences of opinion with respect to methods of punishment. Some legal schools “prescribed capital punishment for sodomy, but others opted only for a relatively mild discretionary punishment.” The Hanbalites are the most severe among Sunni schools, insisting on capital punishment for anal sex in all cases, while the other schools generally restrict punishment to flagellation with or without banishment, unless the culprit is muhsan (Muslim free married adult), and Hanafis often suggest no physical punishment at all, leaving the choice to the judge's discretion. The founder of the Hanafi school Abu Hanifa refused to recognize the analogy between sodomy and zina, although his two principal students disagreed with him on this point. The Hanafi scholar Abu Bakr Al-Jassas (d. 981 AD/370 AH) argued that the two hadiths on killing homosexuals [...] "are not reliable by any means and no legal punishment can be prescribed based on them". Where capital punishment is prescribed and a particular method is recommended, the methods range from stoning (Hanbali, Maliki), to the sword (some Hanbalites and Shafi'ites), or leaving it to the court to choose between several methods, including throwing the culprit off a high building (Shi'ite).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article is to {{determine}} the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> asymmetry <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and the features of its existence in the tourist market. The processes of interaction and relationships are emerged and realized through the formation, transfer, and interchange <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> Market demand and supply are the <b>information</b> <b>of</b> market actors about their intentions and capabilities. Content <b>of</b> <b>information</b> flows, that connect them, plays {{a significant role in the}} functioning of the market. According to the above-mentioned <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the market and considering the role <b>of</b> <b>information</b> for it, market can be represented as the plurality-theoretic model. The asymmetry <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> more specifically the asymmetry <b>of</b> <b>information</b> exchange is the result <b>of</b> uneven <b>information</b> provision <b>of</b> the entities of market relations. It is advisablly to distinguish the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> asymmetry <b>of</b> <b>information</b> as a fact and <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the process and the consequences of its use by market entities. Asymmetry <b>of</b> <b>information</b> is an objective phenomenon at the time of its occurrence. The process of using asymmetry <b>of</b> <b>information</b> is a subjective phenomenon that depends on a person and can lead to positive or negative effects and therefore affect the functioning of the market. Asymmetry <b>of</b> <b>information</b> on the tourism market has its own features regarding the origin, use, and effects.
