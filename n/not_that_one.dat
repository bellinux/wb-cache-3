25|$|Another {{model that}} has been put forth is the incentive-motivation model. The model {{explains}} that the desire for sex comes from an interaction between a sensitive sexual response system and stimuli that {{are present in the}} environment. Researchers argue that this model supports the idea that sexual desire is not spontaneous. Furthermore, this model implies that the case is <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> has sex because one feels sexual desire; rather, the case is that one feels sexual desire because one has sex.|$|E

It is recommended that requests use clear, positive, concrete action language.|$|E
500|$|On March 7, 1999, {{six days}} after {{screening}} a final cut of Eyes Wide Shut for his family and the stars, Kubrick died in his sleep {{at the age of}} 70, after suffering a massive heart attack. His funeral was held five days later at his home estate at Childwickbury Manor, with only close friends and family in attendance, totaling approximately 100 people. The media were kept a mile away outside the entrance gate. Alexander Walker, who attended the funeral, describes it as a [...] "family farewell,... almost like an English picnic", with cellists, clarinetists and singers providing song and music from many of his favorite classical compositions. Kaddish, the Jewish prayer of mourning, was recited. A few of his obituaries mentioned his Jewish background. Among those who gave eulogies were Terry Semel, Jan Harlan, Steven Spielberg, Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise. He was buried next to his favorite tree on the estate. In her book dedicated to Kubrick, his wife Christiane included one of his favorite quotations of Oscar Wilde: [...] "The tragedy of old age is <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> is old, but that one is young." ...|$|E

500|$|In another {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, the actor spoke thoroughly of his departure, saying: [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> hadn't {{agreed to a}} reduction, but they hit you with a sledgehammer. It's done in such an insulting fashion. It could have been dealt with in a far more gracious way. It is cold and hard-nosed... The whole thing was so calculated it was unbelievable... It's not even about the money." [...] Despite this, during contract negotiations, Braeden refused {{to say that he}} had departed fully, but did not know when a return would occur. However, within weeks, news broke that the actor and the series had managed a new contract. In a statement issued by CBS Daytime, they said: [...] "We're very happy that Eric will be remaining with The Young and the Restless. Victor Newman has been {{an important part of the}} Genoa City canvas for nearly 30 years, and we know our audience will be tuning in to see what his plans are next." [...] Onscreen, Braeden exited November 2, 2009, and made his return on January 15, 2010. That same year, the actor celebrated thirty years on the soap opera. In 2012, Braeden experienced further contract negotiations and speculation arose again that he would be leaving. Published reports said that Victor would be absent from the canvas for two weeks and that his contract expired that November. Two months later, it was announced that the actor had signed a new contract with The Young and the Restless, furthering his portrayal of Victor for an unspecified period of time. Braeden stated that he was [...] "very glad we got the negotiations successfully behind us".|$|E

2500|$|Kamaal/The Abstract {{contains}} introspective lyrical themes. Opening {{with the}} album's only rock chord, the opening track [...] "Feelin' It" [...] {{is one of}} the album's few tracks with him rapping and it contains one verse about common life experiences and hassles. It introduces Q-Tip {{on his way to a}} recording studio, during which he is stopped by a police officer who profiles him: [...] "This profiling cop with his profiling ass / Figured the best thing he could do was find a cat to harass. / The little kitten was me, <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> in the tree / The black one with the promise and the wish to be free". The lyrics are based on an experience that Q-Tip had with a policeman. John Murph of Jazz Times interpreted the song's verse as a metaphor for Q-Tip's struggles for absolute creative freedom without resulting in critical backlash. Tiny Mix Tapess Brendan Mahoney interpreted the [...] "profilin' cop" [...] in the song as [...] "another mundane and too-predictable distraction in a world full of them".|$|E

2500|$|Some {{opponents of}} Warren's view {{believe that what}} matters morally is <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> be {{actually}} exhibiting complex mental qualities of the sort she identifies, but rather that one have in oneself a self-directed genetic propensity or natural capacity to develop such qualities. [...] In other words, what is crucial is that one {{be the kind of}} entity or substance that, under the right conditions, actively develops itself to the point of exhibiting Warren's qualities at some point in its life, even if it does not actually exhibit them because of not having developed them yet (embryo, infant) or having lost them (severe Alzheimer's). [...] Because human beings do have this natural capacity—and indeed have it essentially—therefore (on this view) they essentially have a right to life: they could not possibly fail to have a right to life. Further, since modern embryology shows that the embryo begins to exist at conception and has a natural capacity for complex mental qualities, therefore the right to life begins at conception.|$|E
