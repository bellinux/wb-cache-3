40|$|In {{the eastern}} Indian Ocean, the {{anomalous}} Leeuwin Current {{has been reported}} to influence fisheries production, although the exact mechanisms remain unknown. The current, which flows southwards along the shelf-break, intensifies during the autumn and generates numerous meso-scale eddies which propagate offshore into the Indian Ocean. Cyclonic, cold-core eddies may be significant for the input of upwelled nutrients whilst anticyclonic, warm-core eddies provide a mechanism for the entrainment of coastal water, and may cause offshore transport of <b>neritic</b> <b>plankton.</b> The potential impact of meso-scale eddies on Western Australian coastal fisheries depends largely on the spawning season of the target species as well as the duration of the pelagic larval phase. Most coastal finfish species have pelagic larval durations of a few weeks and if, after a short period of entrainment in eddies, they are able to return to the shelf, they could benefit from concentrated food resources within the eddies. On the other hand, if these larvae cannot escape as the eddy propagates offshore, then eddies probably result in increased natural mortality for neritic fishes. In contrast, rock lobster have characteristic phyllosoma larvae with pelagic durations of 9 - 11 months and, if entrained in eddies, could experience improved feeding conditions, in addition to being retained in the ocean adjacent to the area of adult distribution. Data from the SRFME biophysical oceanography study along the Two Rocks transect (2002 - 2005) and two research cruises aboard the RV Southern Surveyor undertaken to study the biological oceanography of Leeuwin Current eddies (October 2003 and May 2006) will be drawn upon to illustrate the above hypotheses...|$|E
40|$|Euphausiids {{collected}} by R/V Stranger during 1959 - 61 were examined {{with respect to}} 1) seasonal change in distribution, abundance and recruitment in the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea and 2) range through the Indo-Australian seas. Discussion of the species is preceded by {{a description of the}} distribution of zooplankton biomass. In the Gulf of Thailand, biomass was found to be three to five times greater than in the open South China Sea. In eastern waters of the Gulf, the peak appeared during the intermonsoon period following northeast winds. The western and northern parts of the Gulf were richest {{under the influence of the}} southwest monsoon. Northern coastal waters of South Viet Nam were richest toward the end of each season: 1) the northeast monsoon when coastal upwelling and southerly flow from the Gulf of Tonkin took place and 2) the southwest monsoon season of northerly flow. The southern shelf and the basin region of the South China Sea yielded the greatest biomass during the southwest monsoon season when flow was from the direction of adjacent neritic waters to the southwest. The Sunda Shelf waters, including the Gulf of Thailand, constitute the extensive neritic province in which Pseudeuphausia lives. The South China Sea basin, though the largest basin in the inter-ocean region, is essentially a cul-de-sac with respect to its oceanic euphausiid assemblage, the species of which are derived from both the tropical and subtropical Pacific to the northeast. They are transported southwestward as far as the Sunda Shelf. During the northeast monsoon season many of the oceanic species tend to extend into shelf waters. Evidently the presence over the shelf of a dense <b>neritic</b> <b>plankton,</b> together with the shallowness of the water which prevents the normal range of euphausiid vertical migration, precludes presence of the oceanic species. Only Stylocheiron species, which do not migrate vertically, extend much beyond the edge of the shelf, rarely entering the Gulf of Thailand. The taxonomic diversity of the predominant species of the South China Sea (each belongs to a different species group) indicates that this assemblage is part of a regional plankton community. The annual reproductive cycles of the oceanic species were like that of neritic Pseudeuphausia, with larvae produced year-round but with maximum spawning taking place during, and at the end of, the northeast monsoon season. Production of Pseudeuphausia in the Gulf of Thailand shifted seasonally from southwest to northeast, evidently in response to coastal enrichment processes initiated by southwest and northeast monsoon winds respectively. Of the parameters measured, only low salinity (‰) correlates with the paucity of larvae. Local occurrences of the species are considered in relation to the global distributions in a study of the effectiveness of the inter-ocean seas in maintaining or interrupting flow between Pacific and Indian Ocean populations and in providing local habitats. The pelagic connection between the two oceans is limited to a succession of deeper seas: Celebes-Molucca-Banda and Flores-Timor. The large number (46) of euphausiid species in this inter-ocean region apparently reflects complexity in the oceanography rather than in the plankton community. Regularly occurring species are either endemic (e. g. Stylocheiron insulare), Indo- Pacific equatorial (e. g. Euphausia diomedeae) or broadly ranging warm-water cosmopolites (e. g. epipelagic Stylocheiron carinatum and mesopelagic Nematobrachion boöpis). Species associated primarily with central water masses of the Indian and Pacific Oceans are sparse though seasonally consistent in occurrence. The most widely-ranging species in the global sense (e. g. Nematobrachion boöpis, Stylocheiron carinatum) exhibit inter-oceanic and inter-hemispheric continuity that appears to have long been firmly established. These species do not have close relatives, with the exceptions Stylocheiron longicorne and S. maximum, each a member of a sub-generic species group. This suggests that the speciation process (population isolations + re-invasions) in Stylocheiron, a genus consisting of members which do not migrate vertically, each occupying a discrete depth interval, may differ from that process in strongly migrating genera such as Euphausia and Thysanopoda. The importance of the Indo-Australian region in the evolution of sub-tropical and tropical species is indicated by 1) the large number of species found there, 2) the present partitioning of central water mass species distributions (e. g. Euphausia brevis exists globally in five sub-populations), and of Indo-Pacific equatorial distributions (E. paragibba exists in separated Pacific and Indian Ocean populations), 3) the patchy confluence of some central and subtropical species through this waterway (e. g. E. mutica), and 4) the existence of Indo- Australian endemics (e. g. E. fallax, E. sanzoi, Nematoscelis lobata). The species of the region, including larval stages of most South China Sea species, are illustrated and briefly described. Thysanopoda subaequalis Boden is synonymized with T. aequalis Hansen, the type material of T. aequalis having been found to possess the characteristics defining T. subaequalis. The species presently called T. aequalis is redescribed as T. astylata. A third geographical form of Stylocheiron longicorne is described as the "North Indian Ocean Form. ...|$|E
