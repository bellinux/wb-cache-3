25|$|One {{explanation}} is that social-media users usually split their time between Facebook and interacting in the real world. When something entertaining happens in real life, people feel the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> it. It might seem harmless, however at some point people begin to substitute one reality with another. As a result, people start to change their behavior and even their assumptions about life, love and friendships, based on the Facebook reality. This leads to cognitive dissonance. Such a discrepancy between perceptions and beliefs can damage people's emotional balance and lead them to experience identity confusion, relationship conflicts, changes in judgement, and even psychotic break.|$|E

25|$|Most {{recreational}} and professional diver training organisations would consider relying on buddy breathing {{from a single}} regulator as an unacceptable risk, {{as the use of}} a secondary demand valve (octopus) or second regulator, either from an alternative scuba cylinder, or from the primary scuba set, is a far more reliable and safe method of supplying emergency air to a diver who is part of a planned team or buddy dive, and a solo diver should carry his/her own emergency gas supply. There should never be a situation on a well planned and executed dive where two divers <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> a single demand valve, but the technique is still considered useful by some diving schools as it teaches control and hones skills under difficult circumstances.|$|E
25|$|From December 2006 to mid-September 2008, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority met 36 times; {{there were}} also lower-level talks. In 2007 Olmert welcomed the Arab League's re-endorsement of the Arab Peace Initiative. In his bid to {{negotiate}} a peace accord and establish a Palestinian state, Olmert proposed a plan to the Palestinians. The centerpiece of Olmert's detailed proposal is the suggested permanent border, which {{would be based on}} an Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank. Olmert proposed annexing at least 6.3% of Palestinian territory, in exchange for 5.8% of Israeli land, with Palestinians receiving alternative land in the Negev, adjacent to the Gaza Strip, as well as territorial link, under Israeli sovereignty, for free passage between Gaza and the West Bank. Israel insisted on retaining an armed presence in the future Palestinian state. Under Abbas's offer, more than 60 percent of settlers would stay in place. Olmert, for his part, was presenting a plan in which the most sparsely populated settlements would be evacuated. Olmert and Abbas both acknowledged that reciprocal relations would be necessary, not hermetic separation. They also acknowledged the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> a single business ecosystem, while cooperating intensively on water, security, bandwidth, banking, tourism and much more. Regarding Jerusalem the leaders agreed that Jewish neighborhoods should remain under Israeli sovereignty, while Arab neighborhoods would revert to Palestinian sovereignty. The Palestinians asked for clarifications of the territorial land swap since they were unable to ascertain what land his percentages affected, since Israeli and Palestinian calculations of the West Bank differ by several hundred square kilometres. For them, in lieu of such clarifications, Olmert's 6.3–6.8% annexation might work out closer to 8.5%, 4 times the 1.9% limit the Palestinians argued a swap should not exceed. The talks ended with both sides claiming the other side dropped follow-up contacts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{field study}} {{performed}} in a professional software development environment shows that the interactions between collocated teammates have various purposes. This paper presents a comprehensive study of ad hoc communications on collocated team based on video recording of professional developers within a large organization. It is found that there are four purposes for ad hoc face-to-face communications; collaboration, cooperation, coordination and socialisation. To {{be able to use}} collective tools in distributed or virtual team environments we must be able to support at some extent the purposes of ad hoc communications that occur naturally in social presence. The main finding of this field study is that collective tools <b>need</b> <b>to</b> satisfy two different purposes. A cooperative system is <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> the know-how <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> build the product and a collaborative system is <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> the knowledge <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> understand the functionalities to be implemented.

2500|$|In {{recent years}} the model formulating {{approach}} of considering a [...] "typical user" [...] in cellular (or other) networks has been used considerably.
