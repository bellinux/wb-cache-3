40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Space Physics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Multipath {{amplifier}} theory: In {{this thesis}} {{it is proven}} that the theoretical minimum <b>noise</b> <b>measure</b> of a multipath amplifier (an amplifier which has multiple parallel amplifiers) is achieved by using the optimum source impedance for the amplifier and the optimum gain for each amplification path. This optimum source impedance and gain can be calculated by using the optimum–loaded input network, i. e. by replacing each amplifier with its optimum source impedance. The resulting <b>noise</b> <b>measure</b> {{is the same as}} the minimum <b>noise</b> <b>measure</b> of the amplifiers used in the amplification paths. Whereas single–path amplifiers can achieve this minimum <b>noise</b> <b>measure</b> over narrow bandwidths, multipath amplifiers are theoretically able to achieve the minimum <b>noise</b> <b>measure</b> over very broad bandwidths. The theory is demonstrated by applying it to distributed amplifiers. In an ideal distributed amplifier, the magnitude of the optimum gain of the amplification paths decreases and the phase delay increases the farther the stage is from the input, with the decrease in gain being faster for higher frequencies. The challenge in designing broadband, low–noise, distributed amplifiers is to achieve optimum gain matching over broad bandwidths. Multipath amplifier design procedure: Based on the theory, a three step design and optimisation procedure is introduced. Firstly, unconditionally stable amplification paths are designed to have small minimum <b>noise</b> <b>measures,</b> then an input network is designed for optimum source impedance matching and lastly an output network is designed for gain matching. Multipath amplifier prototype: The theory and design procedure is demonstrated by optimising a 0. 5 – 2 GHz distributed amplifier. An average <b>noise</b> <b>measure</b> of 0. 3 dB is achieved, which is only 0. 1 dB higher than the minimum <b>noise</b> <b>measure</b> of the amplification stages used. This increase is mainly due to transmission line loss and gain mismatch. Radio telescope feasibility: Multipath amplifiers break the trade–off between noise temperature, bandwidth and source termination that a single–path amplifier has, because they have much more design freedom when designing the input network. In general, the more paths, the larger the low–noise bandwidth, but the larger and more complex the amplifier. Roughly two to three amplification paths are required per octave of bandwidth for LNAs around 1 GHz. When the bandwidth is very narrow, a single path is sufficient. Multipath amplifiers have similar trade–offs between linearity and power consumption, between noise temperature and noise resistance, and between noise temperature and size to a single–path amplifier. Multipath amplifiers are therefore a feasible alternative for use in radio telescopes. Doctora...|$|R

40|$|Noise {{properties}} {{and performance of}} DDR IMPATT diode at Ka Band frequency has been investigated through modeling and simulation technique. An iterative method {{has been used to}} study the small signal negative resistance {{properties and}} it’s effect on the noise performance of the device. Negative resistance of Si and otherscompound semiconductor based IMPATT (like GaAs, SiC, InP, GaN) has been found by this simulation technique. It is obtained that 3 C SiC has maximum negative resistance value of 8. 70 ohm at a dc bias currentdensity of 3. 5 x 107 amp/m 2 at a frequency of 33 GHz. It is also obtained that 3 C SiC has the minimum <b>noise</b> <b>measure</b> value at Ka band. Others avalanche noise parameters like shot noise ratio, noise spectral density have been calculated along with the effects of parasitic series resistance and temperature on the device’s noiseperformance. It is also observed that <b>noise</b> <b>measure</b> of the device is increased with increasing parasitic series resistance and <b>noise</b> <b>measure</b> is decreased with increasing temperature. It is obtained that 3 C SiC has the <b>noise</b> <b>measure</b> value 58. 64 dB at 500 K.

50|$|Measurement {{of audio}} speech-to-noise ratios {{in a way}} which {{reflects}} interfering effects in a meaningful manner is difficult for the kinds of noise often encountered at mobile system receivers. For this reason {{and as a matter of}} convenience, a subjective rating of the interfering effect of the noise using the term “circuit merit” is commonlyused in place of metered measurements. This method uses a scale of five steps to describe performance. These are listed and defined in the above table. The speech-to-noise ratios in dB included in this table are arbitrary numbers which apply if both speech and <b>noise</b> are <b>measured</b> on either a 2B <b>noise</b> <b>measuring</b> set with F1A line weighting or a 3A <b>noise</b> <b>measuring</b> set with C-message weighting.

40|$|The {{spectral}} {{representation of}} a moving average process obtained as a convolution of a kernel with a general <b>noise</b> <b>measure</b> is studied. A proof of the spectral theorem that yields explicit expression for the spectral measure {{in terms of the}} <b>noise</b> <b>measure</b> is presented. The main interest is in <b>noise</b> <b>measures</b> generated by second order Lévy motions. For practical considerations, such measures are easily available through independent sampling. On the other hand spectral measures are not since their increments are dependent, with the notable exception of the Gaussian noise case. For this reason the issue of approximating the spectral measure by independent increments of the noise is also addressed. For the purpose of approximating the moving average process through sums of trigonometric functions, the mean square error of discretization of the spectral representation is assessed. For a specified accuracy, the coefficients of approximation are explicitly given. The method is illustrated for moving averages processes driven by Laplace motion...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} photon flux density on the noise {{properties}} of optically illuminated Double Drift Region (DDR) Mixed Tunneling Avalanche Transit Time (MITATT) device is investigated in this paper. An analytical model is proposed {{to obtain a}} relationship between the normalized difference of electron and hole current density of DDR device and the incident photon flux on it. Simulation is carried out to study the small signal noise spectral density and <b>noise</b> <b>measure</b> of the device under optical illumination.

The method of Hedonic Pricing was used to value the effect of noise on the market value of dwellings. Also the influence of reducing noise on the market value of building lands was investigated. In general measures at the source, such as silent tires, quiet pavements or tracks, appear to be highly cost-effective. Noise barriers seem less cost effective.

Particles A react in clusters of size k and each reaction forms a product molecule P. The back reaction is also allowed, and each cluster can dissociate into k reactants A. To describe {{a situation where the}} reaction is part of a pathway, the system is made open by assuming that particles A are injected and that particles P decay. This is a continuation study.
