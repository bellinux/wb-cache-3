5|$|Halotus died {{sometime}} {{in the latter part}} of the 1st century. At the time of his death, he still held the procuratorship that he had been granted by Galba. He kept this position despite Galba's unseating very soon after it was bestowed and the political uproars of The Year of the Four Emperors. At the time of his death, Halotus' public reputation had been at least partially restored and he had accumulated some degree of wealth after he had been cleared by Galba. Details relating to his death are not recorded in any of the writings of ancient historians, and <b>neither</b> <b>are</b> any specific dates.|$|E

Nomination records are sealed for fifty years. While posthumous nominations are not permitted, awards can be made if the individual died in the months between the decision of the prize committee (typically in October) and the ceremony in December. Prior to 1974, posthumous awards were permitted if the recipient had died after being nominated.|$|E

5|$|Filipino and English are the {{official}} languages of the country. Filipino is a standardized version of Tagalog, spoken mainly in Metro Manila and other urban regions. Both Filipino and English {{are used in}} government, education, print, broadcast media, and business. In most towns, the local indigenous language is spoken. The Philippine constitution provides {{for the promotion of}} Spanish and Arabic on a voluntary and optional basis, although <b>neither</b> <b>are</b> used on as wide a scale as in the past. Spanish, which was widely used as a lingua franca in the late nineteenth century, has since declined greatly in use, but is experiencing revival due to government promotions, while Arabic is mainly used in Islamic schools in Mindanao. However, Spanish loanwords are still present today in many of the indigenous Philippine languages.|$|E
5|$|Ski flying events {{outside of}} the World Championships are a regular feature on the Ski Jumping World Cup calendar, usually {{occurring}} on two or three hills only. Because athletes almost always participate in both disciplines, points scored in ski flying also count towards the Ski Jumping World Cup standings. From 1991 to 2001, and from 2009 onwards, an additional title and trophy – the Ski Flying World Cup – has been awarded {{at the end of}} each season to the overall points winner of solely ski flying competitions, even if only one took place. In contrast to the Ski Flying World Championships, the Ski Flying World Cup is contested as a season. The former can be considered equivalent to the Ski Jumping World Championships, in that both are tournaments staged during the Ski Jumping World Cup season, but are isolated from it; therefore, points from <b>neither</b> <b>are</b> included as part of the World Cup standings.|$|E

These efforts at a permanent settlement fell through, however, and the support for Montfort's government gradually eroded. Henry's oldest son, Edward – the later King Edward Istarted a military campaign that ended in the Battle of Evesham in August 1265, where Earl Simon was defeated and killed. Parts of the baronial resistance still held out, {{but by the end of}} 1266 the final besieged garrison at Kenilworth Castle surrendered. The rebels were given pardons according to terms set out in the Dictum of Kenilworth.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to his hotel suite that night, Bond finds Romanova {{waiting for him in}} his bed and has sex with her; <b>neither</b> <b>are</b> aware that SPECTRE is filming them. The next day, Romanova heads off for a pre-arranged rendezvous at Hagia Sophia to drop off the floor plans for the consulate, with Grant ensuring Bond receives the plans by killing the other Bulgarian tail who attempts to intercept the drop. Using the plans, Bond and Kerim Bey successfully steal the Lektor and, together with Romanova, escape with the device onto the Orient Express. On the train, Kerim Bey quickly notices a Soviet security officer named Benz tailing them, prompting him and Bond to subdue him. When Bond leaves Benz and Kerim Bey alone together, Grant kills them and makes it appear as though they killed each other, preventing Bond from leaving the train with Romanova to rendezvous with one of Kerim's men.|$|E
5|$|There {{are small}} {{enclosed}} chambers {{to either side}} of the centre chapel. The chapel of St Padarn is on the left, with an imitation pointed vault and slate slab floor. In the entrance to the chapel there is a window on the left side depicting scenes from the manuscript Life of Padarn. The single-light window with various figures, scenes and motifs is by Elizabeth Edmundson, and dates from 1988. It includes Teilo, Padarn and Dewi (David) at the top, a healing by St Samson, Maelgwn, Arthur and Caradog, two kings of Ireland on horseback and a figure with the Virgin and Child. The figures are mostly modelled on figures from the Book of St Chad. In the chapel itself, which has a low slate altar stone and seat, is a porcelain relief sculpture by Gillian Still showing a story from the Life, the ordeal by boiling water. The chapel is lit only by two small windows (one with red glass, the other green) into the central chapel. Neither the altar stone in the larger room nor that in the chapel of St Padarn have been consecrated so <b>neither</b> <b>are</b> strictly speaking altars, and neither can be used for a Eucharistic service.|$|E
