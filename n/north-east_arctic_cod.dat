Shifts in maturation reactions norms can be rapid and estimating them can help disentangle plastic and evolutionary changes in the age and size at maturation, which is important from a management perspective, as genetic changes are likely more difficult to reverse.

The density of birds (156 bird/km** 2) was high compared to that of other locations in the Canadian Arctic. Several bird species were more active early in the morning and with winds from the south, possibly due to an increase in <b>Arctic</b> <b>cod</b> feeding on zooplankton at the surface.

The <b>North-East</b> <b>Arctic</b> <b>cod</b> is spawning from February to April, and the first abundance index of a new yearclass is assessed at an age of six months by midwater trawl survey. Estimates of year class abundance (VPA) vary between 115 and 1818 million fish at age 3, a much smaller range than indicated by the 0 -group survey indexes for six months old cod. In August/September the 0 -group cod are distributed in the Barents Sea, around Bear Island and along West-Spitsbergen. Strong yearclasses have a much wider distribution than poor ones. Information from this survey may be used in planning the release of artificially propagated cod fry, which could then take place in September. Because of lack of reliable basis for estimating the natural mortality of cod; especially on the younger age groups, the number of cod fry in September cannot be precisely estimated. However, for areas on able range of natural mortalities, the number of fry needed to raise a poor year class to a strong one at the 0 -group stage would be in the order of 2600 - 5200 million. Artificial propagation of cod fry would have to start in March, but it may be stopped later in years with high natural production of fry in order to reduce the effects of density dependent growth. Artificially propagated fry should have to be released in the most suit able areas. Observations on hydrographical and food conditions are therefore needed for the most suitable time. In order to avoid a high degree of cannibalism, the distribution of l- 3 -group cod would also have to be taken into account.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 Fatty acids, {{the main}} {{components}} of lipids, are crucial for energy storage and other physiological functions in animals and plants. Dietary fatty acids are incorporated and conserved in consumer tissues in predictable patterns and can be analyzed in animal tissues to determine the composition of an individual's diet. This study measured the variation in fatty acid profiles of three abundant Arctic forage fish species, <b>Arctic</b> <b>Cod</b> (Boreogadus saida), Canadian Eelpout (Lycodes polaris), and Longear Eelpout (Lycodes seminudus) across multiple years (2010 - 2013) and geographic locations (Beaufort and Chukchi seas). These fishes are important prey items of marine mammals, sea birds, and predatory fishes, and as such they serve as a critical trophic step connecting lower trophic-level production to higher level predators. Analyzing forage fish fatty acid profiles across multiple years and geographic locations can provide insight into system-level trends in lipid transfer through the Arctic ecosystem. Fatty acid profiles differed among species, with <b>Arctic</b> <b>Cod</b> having higher concentrations of pelagic zooplankton indicator fatty acids, and Eelpout species containing higher concentrations of indicators for benthic prey. While the two Eelpout species displayed major overlap in fatty acid profiles, differences in individual fatty acids may represent niche separation between Canadian and Longear Eelpout in the Beaufort Sea. In addition to variation between species, fatty acid profiles also differed in <b>Arctic</b> <b>Cod</b> between the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, and among collection years. High lipid content and energy-rich fatty acid classes observed in Chukchi Sea <b>Arctic</b> <b>Cod</b> relative to the Beaufort Sea <b>Arctic</b> <b>Cod</b> may indicate favorable feeding conditions in this region over the years sampled, and high energy density of <b>Arctic</b> <b>Cod</b> as prey.
