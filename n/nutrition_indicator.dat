It is also making slow progress, {{improving}} child well-being by just 32% over 1990-2006 (compared to East Asia's 45% improvement). This is because India (where almost three-quarters of the region's children live) made the least progress of any country in South Asia; just a 27% improvement. In this region, child nutrition is a substantial obstacle; almost 1 in 2 children is underweight.

40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to explore which demographic and health status variables moderated the relationship between psychological distress and three nutrition indicators: the consumption of fruits, vegetables and takeaway. - Method We analysed data from the 2009 Self-Reported Health Status Survey Report collected in the state of Queensland, Australia. Adults (N = 6881) reported several demographic and health status variables. Moderated logistic regression models were estimated separately for the three <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators,</b> testing as moderators demographic (age, gender, educational attainment, household income, remoteness, and area-level socioeconomic status) and health status indicators (body mass index, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes status). - Results Several significant interactions emerged between psychological distress, demographic (age, area-level socioeconomic status, and income level), and health status variables (body mass index, diabetes status) in predicting the <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators.</b> Relationships between distress and the <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> were not significantly different by gender, remoteness, educational attainment, high cholesterol status, and high blood pressure status. - Conclusions The associations between psychological distress and several <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> differ amongst population subgroups. These findings suggest that in distressed adults, age, area-level socio-economic status, income level, body mass index, and diabetes status may serve as protective or risk factors through increasing or decreasing the likelihood of meeting nutritional guidelines.

40|$|Background: Non-optimal {{infant and}} young child feeding (IYCF) {{practices}} {{are associated with}} malnutrition, infant mortality and under-five mortality, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the risk of under-five mortality is 15 times higher than developed countries. Objective: To determine implementation effects of the Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding before and after WBTi tool assessment using infant/child health data collected between 2000 and 2013 in Cameroon. Methods: A descriptive analysis of Cameroon’s policies, programmes and practices was conducted using the WBTi tool. Child survival and <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> before (2003 - 2008) and after (2009 - 2013) WBTi assessment were analyzed {{using data from the}} 2009 and 2015 State of the World’s Children statistical tables Results: Implementation of the GSIYCF improved after WBTi assessment in 2008. Cameroon’s policies and programmes improved more than practices. Under-five and infant mortality rates over the period markedly improved. From 2009 to 2013 there was a 9. 4 % increase in complementary feeding rates, 14. 3 % increase in rates of infants still breastfeeding/breastfeeding at age two, and a 6 % decrease in undernutrition in children between zero and 59 months. Conclusion: The findings of this study reflect an increase in IYCF implementation effects on child survival and <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> after WBTi assessment compared with the WHO tool era.

40|$|The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) {{has been}} an {{important}} contribution to the debate on national and international poverty measurement. With the creation of the global MPI, OHPI and UNDP have provided a household-level multidimensional poverty measure for over 100 developing countries that can usefully complement the widely used $ 1. 25 a day income poverty indicator. Given its link to the concept of human development, it is an important element of the suite of human development indicators maintained and published by UNDP. Nonetheless, there are many open empirical questions and issues regarding the conceptual underpinning of the MPI that need to be discussed and carefully considered. This essay discusses issues with the dual cut-off method for poverty identification, and how inequality could be incorporated in this poverty measure. Moreover, the choice of headline indicator is debated. We also propose a number of changes regarding the empirical implementation. These include dropping the WHS as one of the data sources, dropping the BMI as a <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicator,</b> and changing the age ranges and cutoffs for the education and mortality indicators. Different approaches to deal with the large share of households where information on an MPI indicator is missing are also discussed. The empirical relevance of these changes are analysed using the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for Armenia, Ethiopia, and India. We argue that these changes could pose improvements to the current formulation, but one may need to investigate them further and for a larger number of countries. In a final section, we briefly comment on the HDRO revisions to the MPI in the 2014 Human Development Report, which have been partly based on the recommendations made in this paper...|$|E

Aim of the study: Assessment of the relationship between 24 -hour blood pressure parameters in hospitalised teenagers with primary hypertension and their nutrition status at the stage of diagnosis. Material and methods: The study group consisted of  112 patients aged 11 – 17 years (42 girls and  70 boys) with diagnosed primary hypertension. <b>Nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> were taken into account. The study group was divided into group I – persons with normal nutrition status (40 patients) and group II – persons with overweight/obesity (72 patients). The groups were compared using the t-test with a separate variance estimation or with the Mann–Whitney U test. The relationship between blood pressure parameters and nutrition status indicators was assessed based on Spearman’s rank correlation. Results: The study groups were significantly different in terms of the <b>nutrition</b> status <b>indicators,</b> but no significant differences were observed in the evaluated blood pressure parameters.

40|$|Background: There is {{increasing}} {{evidence of the}} multiple effects of diets on public health nutrition, society and environment. Sustainability and food security are closely inter-related. The traditional Mediterranean Diet (MD) is recognized as a healthier dietary pattern with a lower environmental impact. As a case study, the MD may guide innovative inter-sectorial efforts to counteract the degradation of ecosystems, loss of biodiversity and homogeneity of diets due to globalization, through the improvement of sustainable healthy dietary patterns. This consensus position paper defines a suite of the most appropriate <b>nutrition</b> and health <b>indicators</b> for assessing the sustainability of diets based on the MD. Methods: In 2011, an informal International Working Group from different national and international institutions was convened. Through online and face-to-face brainstorming meetings over four years, a set of <b>nutrition</b> and health <b>indicators</b> for sustainability was identified and refined. Results: Thirteen <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> of sustainability relating were identified in five areas: •Biochemical characteristics of food (A 1. Vegetable/animal protein consumption ratios; (A 2. Average dietary energy adequacy; (A 3. Dietary energy density score; (A 4. Nutrient density of diet) : •Food Quality (A 5. Fruit and vegetable consumption/intakes; (A 6. Dietary diversity score) : •Environment (A 7. Food biodiversity composition and consumption; (A 8. Rate of Local/regional foods and seasonality; (A 9. Rate of eco-friendly food production and/or consumption) : •Lifestyle (A 10. Physical activity/Physical inactivity prevalence; (A 11. Adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern) •Clinical Aspects; (A 12. Diet-related morbidity/mortality statistics; (A 13. Nutritional Anthropometry. A standardized set of information was provided for each indicator: definition, methodology, background, data sources, limitations of the indicator and references. Conclusions: The selection and analysis of these indicators has been performed (where possible) with specific reference to the MD. Sustainability of food systems is an urgent priority for governments and international organisations to address the serious socioeconomic and environmental implications of short-sighted and short-term practices for agricultural land and rural communities. These proposed <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> will be a useful methodological framework for designing health, education and agricultural policies in order, not only to conserve the traditional diets of the Mediterranean area as a common cultural heritage and lifestyle, but also to enhance th...|$|R

5000|$|The {{experiences}} of famine relief organizations {{throughout the world}} over the 1980s and 1990s resulted {{in at least two}} major developments: the [...] "livelihoods approach" [...] and the increased use of <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> to determine the severity of a crisis. Individuals and groups in food stressful situations will attempt to cope by rationing consumption, finding alternative means to supplement income, etc., before taking desperate measures, such as selling off plots of agricultural land. When all means of self-support are exhausted, the affected population begins to migrate in search of food or fall victim to outright mass starvation. Famine may thus be viewed partially as a social phenomenon, involving markets, the price of food, and social support structures. A second lesson drawn was the increased use of rapid nutrition assessments, in particular of children, to give a quantitative measure of the famine's severity.|$|R

For these surveys, an accurate {{estimate of the}} design effect is critical to calculate a sample size that achieves adequate precision with the minimum number of sampling units. This paper describes the variability in design effect for three key <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> measured in small-scale surveys and models the association of design effect with parameters hypothesized to explain this variability. Methods 380 small-scale surveys from 28 countries conducted between 2006 and 2013 were analyzed. We calculated prevalence and design effect of wasting, underweight, and stunting for each survey as well as standard deviations of the underlying continuous Z-score distribution. Mean cluster size, survey location and year were recorded. To describe design effects, median and interquartile ranges were examined. Generalized linear regression models were run to identify potential predictors of design effect. Results Median design effect was under 2. 00 for all three indicators; for wasting, the median was 1. 35, the lowest among the indicators. Multivariable linear regression models suggest significant, positive associations of design effect and mean cluster size for all three indicators, and with prevalence of wasting and underweight, but not stunting. Standard deviation was positively associated with design effect for wasting but negatively associated for stunting. Survey region was significant in all three models. Conclusions This study supports the current field survey guidance recommending the use of 1. 5 as a benchmark for design effect of wasting, but suggests this value may not be large enough for surveys with a primary objective of measuring stunting or underweight. The strong relationship between design effect and region in the models underscores the continued need to consider country- and locality-specific estimates when designing surveys.

This will have a direct impact on food security and nutrition in smallholder farming systems since traditionally the main aim will be to sustain the family and selling surplus where possible. This makes crop diversification a more important climate smart option as improving food security and diet options will help in building resilience to intensifying climate change and variability effects by smallholder farmers.

But the statistic that many nutritionists point to when lauding the country as a nutrition success is Peru’s rate of childhood stunting (Figure 14. 1). In 2014, 14. 6 percent of children under five years of age were stunted. While this rate is not as low as the country’s other <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators,</b> it reflects a remarkable improvement. Less than a decade earlier, the prevalence was twice as high (29. 5 percent). 4 How was this rapid progress achieved—not only at a national level, but across all of Peru’s diverse regions, even poor rural ones including the Andean Highlands, and even amongst the poorest 20 percent of the population?Book chapterPRIFPRI 1; Transform Nutrition; compact 2025; F Strengthening institutions and governance; B Promoting healthy food systemsDGO; PHND; A 4 NHCGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A 4 NH...|$|R
40|$|South Asia is home {{to nearly}} a quarter of the world’s {{population}} and is a region of dynamic economic growth, yet it performs relatively poorly on health and <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators.</b> As a potential route towards addressing this poor performance, a range of accountability initiatives has been implemented to improve service delivery in the health and nutrition sectors. This is a rich and vibrant field, with a great deal to offer in terms of best practice; but there is little work that focuses on South Asian innovation and practice generally, and takes a comparative and theoretical perspective to ground existing and future accountability initiatives in health and nutrition specifically. This report fills this gap. It first summarises current concepts and issues in accountability thinking and practice, focusing on practices commonly referred to as ‘social accountability’. It goes on to contrast these with the ‘standard model’ of political and administrative accountability, which is prevalent in the literature, and points to ways in which reality often deviates from this standard model. Against this general conceptual and theoretical backdrop, it examines health systems in South Asia in the light of assumptions underpinning the standard model of accountability.

40|$|Background: The {{positive}} {{association between}} parental socioeconomic position (PSEP) and health among adolescents may be partly explained by dietary behaviour. We investigated the associations between fruit intake, vegetable intake, energy-dense food intake, the Healthy Nutrition Score for Kids and Youth (HuSKY) and parental {{education in a}} nationwide, cluster-randomized sample of adolescents in Germany. Methods: The German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents 2003 – 2006 (KiGGS) included 17, 641 individuals aged 0 – 17 years and their parents. Complete information on relevant variables was available for 6359 individuals in the 11 – 17 age group. The associations between <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> and parental education were analysed separately for boys and girls, using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for age, region, income, occupation, physical activity and weight status related variables, were calculated for the associations between parental education and <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators.</b> Results: After full adjustment, higher parental education level was associated with lower energy-dense food intake – with an OR of 1. 3 (95 % CI 1. 0 – 1. 7) for boys with secondary educated parents and 1. 8 (1. 4 – 2. 3) for boys with tertiary educated parents compared to boys with primary educated parents; the corresponding ORs for girls were 1. 2 (0. 9 – 1. 5) and 1. 6 (1. 2 – 2. 2). Higher parental education was associated with higher fruit intake – with an OR of 1. 3 (1. 0 – 1. 7) for boys with secondary educated parents and 2. 0 (1. 5 – 2. 7) for boys with tertiary educated parents compared to boys with primary educated parents; the corresponding ORs for girls were 1. 0 (0. 8 – 1. 4) and 1. 5 (1. 0 – 2. 1). Among boys and girls with tertiary educated parents compared to those with primary educated parents an OR of 1. 3 (CI boys: 1. 0 – 1. 7, CI girls: 1. 0 – 1. 6) was observed for high vegetable intake. Among boys with tertiary educated parents compared to boys with primary educated parents an OR of 1. 6 (1. 2 – 2. 2) was observed for a high HuSKY; the corresponding OR for girls was 1. 5 (1. 1 – 1. 9). Conclusions: A high PSEP is associated with consumption of less energy-dense food, more {{fruits and vegetables and}} more favourable overall dietary behaviour. Preferably school-based interventions are needed to promote healthy dietary behaviour among German adolescents and a special effort is needed to reach adolescents from low-PSEP families...|$|R
40|$|Background: The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) {{launched}} a health information system (HIS) in 2005 to enhance quality and consistency of routine health information available in post-emergency refugee camps. This paper reviews <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> and examines their application for monitoring and evaluating {{the performance of}} UNHCR nutrition programs in more than 90 refugee camps in 18 countries. Methods: The HIS is a primary source of feeding program data which is collected using standardized case definitions and reporting formats across refugee camps in multiple settings. Data was aggregated across time periods and within and across countries for analysis. Basic descriptive statistics were then compared to UNHCR program performance standards. Results: Camp populations covered by the HIS ranged from 192, 000 to 219, 000 between 2007 and mid- 2009; 87 % of under five children covered by the HIS were in Africa and 13 % in Asia. Average moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) and severe acute malnutrition (SAM) rates reported in 74 of 81 camps for the 2007 - 2009 time periods were 7. 0 % and 1. 6 %, respectively. The supplementary feeding program (SFP) admission rate was 151 / 1000 /yr with 93 % of SFP admissions occurring in Africa. SFP performance consistently exceeded all UNHCR standards {{with the exception of}} length of enrollment. Average length of SFP enrollment was 12 weeks in Africa and 22 weeks in Asi...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe {{abuse of}} alcohol {{as well as}} smoking affects {{behaviour}} related to nutrition and nutritional state. The {{aim of the research}} was to assess the nutritional status of alcohol dependent patients, smokers and non-smokers, assigned to subgroups by age and clinical variables. Material and MethodThe examined group was composed of 49 alcohol-dependent males undergoing inpatient treatment aged 27 – 69 (17 non-smoking and 32 tobacco smokers). A number of socio-demographic and clinical interviews were carried out with the patients, and anthropometric measurements and blood samples were taken for laboratory tests. ResultsThe anthropometric research indicated that the subjects who abused alcohol and smoked cigarettes had BMI (Body Mass Index), FM% (percentage body Fat Mass) and WHR (Waist/Hip Ratio) scores below the norm. The AMC (fat-free Arm Muscle Circumference) variable score was similar for subjects who were both smokers and non-smokers. DiscussionThe metabolic processes that regulate the nutrition status of alcohol dependent subjects are complex. Therefore, besides use of nicotine as a factor of body mass reduction, we could look for other variables such as age, length and intensity of alcohol dependence, quantity of alcohol doses or liver function. However, research results show that nicotine smoking especially leads to decrease of body mass. ConclusionSmoking is an important factor affecting the values of <b>nutrition</b> <b>indicators</b> among alcohol dependent persons...|$|R
