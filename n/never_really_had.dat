25|$|Despite captain Graeme Smith {{becoming}} {{victim of}} Zander de Bruyn's bowling for just two runs, Somerset Sabres still posted a big target, thanks to Matthew Wood, who made 94 off only 35 balls before falling to Nadeem Malik six {{short of a}} century. Wood's smashing helped the Sabres to 210 for 6, although no other batsman passed 30. Graeme Hick tried to emulate Wood, but could only make 87 before Ian Blackwell {{got the better of}} him, and from then on Worcestershire <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> a chance. Blackwell finished with two for 20 in his four overs, and could take his share of the honour for Somerset's surprising win.|$|E

25|$|The school <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> a {{permanent}} location until 1905, when a building was erected {{at the present}} site of Saint John Paul II High School. In 1930, the building was rebuilt. The building was renovated in 1939, due to the increase of students. Unfortunately, the building was already three stories tall in the 1950s and {{there was very little}} room with which the building could use for expansion. This also was complicated by a lack of room for athletic fields, which included McKeon Field and a football/soccer field. It was decided that a new school should be built using land willed to the town by Enoch Cobb.|$|E

Except when obviously imitating standard surf guitar, Burrell provides texture, specifically the [...] "water sound" [...] popularized by Vinnie Bell.

We drew that game 2–2 and <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> problems. For me, it was the proof that we were at the international level." ...|$|E

Ry Cooder's guitar parts are handled by Manuel Galbán, a former member of Cuban vocal group Los Zafiros, who played on Ibrahim Ferrer's first solo record with Cooder and appeared in Wim Wenders' film. Following a 2007 performance in London, a reviewer at The Independent described the ensemble as [...] "something of an anomaly in music business terms, due to their changing line-up and the fact that they've <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> one defining front person", adding, [...] "It's hard to know what to expect from what is more of a brand than a band." ...|$|E
500|$|The film (and {{subsequent}} novel) were memoirs {{written by}} Herman Raucher; they detailed {{the events in}} his life {{over the course of}} the summer he spent on Nantucket Island in 1942 when he was fourteen years old. Originally, the film was meant to be a tribute to his friend Oscar [...] "Oscy" [...] Seltzer, an Army medic killed in the Korean War. Seltzer was shot dead on a battlefield in Korea whilst attending to a wounded man; this happened on Raucher's birthday, and consequently, Raucher has not celebrated a birthday since. During the course of writing the screenplay, Raucher came to the realization that despite growing up with Oscy and having bonded with him through their formative years, the two had <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> any meaningful conversations or gotten to know one another on a more personal level.|$|E

He made his first movie when he was eight years old and started making movies on a Betamax video camera which his dad bought in 1982 when he was twelve years old. He later started using 8 mm film but realized that video was easier. He began writing in adolescence, and at 17 years old he began experimenting with a Bolex sixteen millimeter camera. After years of experimenting with [...] "standard fare", he wrote and filmed his first real production as {{a senior in high school}} at Montclair Prep using money he earned cleaning cages at a pet store. The film was a thirty-minute mockumentary shot on video called The Dirk Diggler Story (1988), about a pornography star; the story was inspired by John Holmes, who also served as a major inspiration for Boogie Nights.|$|E
500|$|California Chrome raced {{next in the}} September 20 Pennsylvania Derby at Parx Racing. He was the favorite, but {{drew the}} inside number 1 post position. Kentucky Derby rivals Candy Boy and Tapiture also entered. Bayern, who had a poor {{performance}} in the Preakness Stakes but later won the Haskell Invitational, was the second favorite. [...] Parx provided significant financial incentives to any horse entering who previously won a triple crown race or other selected Grade I races, so California Chrome's connections earned $200,000 simply for having him start. Trapped on the rail, first by a speed horse {{in the initial stages}} of the race, and again on the far turn by a challenger who faded in the stretch, California Chrome was unable to gain momentum and finished sixth. Bayern had a clean trip, leading wire to wire, and won by [...] lengths.

500|$|Mitchell {{revealed}} that Romeo's relationship with Indigo Walker (Samara Weaving) would drift {{apart in the}} event of the [...] "love triangle" [...] storyline. Executive producer Cameron Welsh promised viewers that the storyline would play {{a big part of the}} serial in 2011. He also stated: [...] "Fans will definitely take sides on this one. Luke Mitchell, Rebecca Breeds and Samara Weaving are having a great time with this storyline, and we'll see a new side to all of them as they face the consequences of their actions." [...] Breeds later explained Ruby's reasoning and the hidden issue which makes her believe she loves him so quickly stating: [...] "Ruby has a lot of insecurity because Ruby <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> a father figure. There's a lot of looking to belong and looking for love because she's had a displaced family life, and she feels like Romeo is her family. Romeo has some issues of his own. He is struggling with his relationship with Indi. The pair find themselves in a similar place of understanding." [...] After Romeo sleeps with Ruby, Mitchell said Romeo immediately regrets it. Ruby then decides to reveals the truth to Indigo. This ruins their friendship and Weaving said: [...] "I think that friendship is pretty much over now!".|$|E

50|$|The show {{suffered}} {{from being a}} daily 60-minute production. With only a finite amount of news and reviews to cover each week, items and features were sometimes stretched and games that <b>never</b> <b>really</b> should <b>have</b> been featured that prominently had significant airtime. Although the strategy may have not pleased all videogaming fans who watched the show, the approach taken by the production meant that apart from keeping costs low the series showcased new talent and originated some innovative strands.|$|R

2500|$|While noise rock has <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> any {{mainstream}} popularity, the raw, distorted and feedback-intensive {{sound of}} some noise rock bands had {{an influence on}} grunge. Among them are Wisconsin's Killdozer, and most notably San Francisco's Flipper, a band known for its slowed-down and murky [...] "noise punk". The Butthole Surfers' mix of punk, heavy metal and noise rock was a major influence, particularly on the early work of Soundgarden.|$|E
50|$|As he {{was getting}} older, Louis XV was slowly {{becoming}} less inclined to visit the brothel-like Parc-aux-Cerfs, and {{the women of the}} court soon began planning on throwing themselves at his feet to win the vacant place left open by Madame de Pompadour's death. One notable such lady was Beatrix de Choiseul-Stainville, Duchess de Gramont, sister of the duc de Choiseul.

Despite his menial job, Gary is actually a graduate of Cornell University, having majored in hotel management. In {{the fourth and fifth}} seasons, Gary is portrayed as having issues adapting to Selina's presidency, since he can no longer be as close to her as previously, due to lack of security clearance. When Selina fails to win reelection, he remains on as her {{personal aide}}. Hale describes Gary's loyalty to Selina stemming from the idea that the character [...] "is {{one of those guys who}} <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> an identity.

2500|$|One {{issue at}} the start of Infinites {{development}} was reassembling the Irrational team. 2K had moved some of Levine's team, including Jon Chey, to 2K Marin to help develop BioShock 2. Levine had considered he and Chey to be [...] "the yin and yang of the organization", with Chey handling production matters while Levine worked on the creative side. As such, Levine had to find people to help replace these absences, but felt that he <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> rebuilt Irrational for development of Infinite, and there was a schism in the company throughout the development period. The larger expectations of Infinite required Levine to manage a team of 150 developers, which {{he was not able to}} get to know personally as he had been able to for BioShock. The stress of having many more responsibilities with the larger team took its toll on Levine. After the game was released, Levine had looked back over the past five years and found how much he had aged, and believed the period had affected his health and his personal relationships. Instead of staying on to build an even better game, Levine opted to leave Irrational Games, and started a separate smaller project.|$|E
30|$|Current green burial {{practices}} have {{only just begun}} {{to move in the}} direction of C 2 C design for burial clothing. The modern funeral industry, with its emphasis on preservation and resistance to change, has shown reluctance to embrace the natural death care movement (Doughty 2014). Therefore, it seems more likely that the choices in burial clothing that American consumers have available to them will have to be brought to their awareness in alternative ways. The next step is for consumers to be made aware of the possibilities for green burial garments and for designers to rise to fill this need. When designing clothing for green burial, fibers and textiles, including dyes, can be selected with the nourishment of microflora in mind. Clothing design for green burial can incorporate the principles of C 2 C design, resulting in use of fibers and textiles that acknowledge the grave as <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>having</b> been a site of eternal, changeless rest, but supporting it in its role as a place of active transformation of the body into food and energy for the soil around it.|$|R

The coldness of disdain to him, the fear of his future acts which was based on disbelief of the existence of that finer nature with which she had credited him, all proved to her convincingly that he could <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> been within the charmed circle of her inner life. Did she but know it, there was an even stronger evidence of her indifference to him in the ready manner in which her thoughts flew past him in their circling sweep. For a moment she saw him as the centre of a host of besetting fears; but her own sense of superior power nullified the force of the vision. She was able to cope with him and his doings, were there such need. And so her mind flew back to the personal side of her trouble: her blindness, her folly, her shame.|$|R
