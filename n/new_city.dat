5|$|A statewide {{referendum}} on the ballot that day continued the work begun by the <b>new</b> <b>city</b> charter in asking voters to consolidate {{the city and county}} governments in Philadelphia. In 1854, all of the municipalities in Philadelphia County had been consolidated into one city, but many county offices still existed, duplicating the efforts of city officials. The merger would also bring county offices under the civil service protections of the <b>new</b> <b>city</b> charter. Merging the city and county governments had been defeated in a 1937 referendum, but in 1951 the question was overwhelmingly approved. Two other ballot proposals authorized the city to borrow $17 million for municipal improvements and $14 million for the gas works; both passed by a five-to-one margin.|$|E
