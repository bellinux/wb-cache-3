5|$|During {{the fights}} for the ramparts of Wola, only {{artillery}} {{of the second}} line gave limited support to the outnumbered Polish troops. Krukowiecki claimed after the war that he ordered Dembiński, Bem and General Franciszek Młokosiewicz to support the first line, but apparently none of them received the order. General Ludwik Bogusławski, commander of the 3rd Infantry Division manning the second line, could have supported the forts of the first line, but he could <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> was happening in Fort 56 due to dense smoke and the trees of Brühl's Garden.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1932–33 series, several authors, {{including}} {{many of the}} players involved, released books expressing various points of view about bodyline. Many {{argued that it was}} a scourge on cricket and must be stamped out, while some did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> all the fuss was about. The series has been described as the most controversial period in Australian cricket history, and voted the most important Australian moment by a panel of Australian cricket identities. The MCC asked Harold Larwood to sign an apology to them for his bowling in Australia, making his selection for England again conditional upon it. Larwood was furious at the notion, pointing out that he had been following orders from his upper-class captain, and that was where any blame should lie. Larwood refused, never played for England again, and became vilified in his own country. Douglas Jardine always defended his tactics and in the book he wrote about the tour, In Quest of the Ashes, described allegations that the England bowlers directed their attack with the intention of causing physical harm as stupid and patently untruthful. The immediate effect of the law change which banned bodyline in 1935 was to make commentators and spectators sensitive to the use of short-pitched bowling; bouncers became exceedingly rare and bowlers who delivered them were practically ostracised. This attitude ended after the Second World War, and among the first teams to make extensive use of short-pitched bowling was the Australian team captained by Bradman between 1946 and 1948. Other teams soon followed.|$|E

Fischer was given CPR on the Wings' bench and then carried out on a stretcher. Nashville had a 1–0 lead within the game and it was decided that the score would be added onto the rescheduled game later in the season.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{following}} his capture, when his remand was extended, Kuntar {{confessed that he}} had bludgeoned Einat to death with {{the butt of his}} rifle. Later, however, when testifying in court, Kuntar denied the charges. In his testimony, Kuntar asserted that Israeli gunfire had killed Danny Haran as soldiers burst in to free him, and that he did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happened to Einat after passing out from blood lost from five bullet wounds. He explained that the group's goal had been to take hostages back to Lebanon, and that he had taken the 4-year-old to prevent Israeli police from shooting at them.|$|E

The mother, Victoire, came out but she too could see nothing. The boys’ parents could <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> their children were seeing that night and called for Sister Vitaline, the local school teacher. She, like the boys’ parents, could also not see the apparition, and called for two girls, Françoise Richer and Jeanne-Marie Lebosse, aged nine and eleven. Sister Vitaline suggested that perhaps Our Lady was visible only to the children. Without any knowledge of the apparition, these two girls looked {{into the night sky}} and began describing Our Lady in the same exact detail as the Barbedette boys had described.|$|E

500|$|During its development, the {{typewriter}} {{evolved from a}} crude curiosity into a practical device, the basic form of which became the industry standard. The machine incorporated elements which became fundamental to typewriter design, including a cylindrical platen and a four-rowed QWERTY keyboard. Several design deficiencies remained, however. The Sholes and Glidden could print only upper-case letters—an issue remedied in its successor, the Remington No.2—and was a [...] "blind writer", meaning the typist could <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> was being written as it was entered.|$|E

"The general discontent I {{felt with}} woman's portion as wife, housekeeper, physician, and spiritual guide, the chaotic {{conditions}} into which everything fell without her constant supervision, and the wearied, anxious {{look of the}} majority of women, impressed me with a strong feeling that some active measures should be taken to remedy the wrongs of society in general, and of women in particular. My experience at the World Anti-slavery Convention, all I had read of the legal status of women, and the oppression I saw everywhere, together swept across my soul, intensified now by many personal experiences. It seemed as if all the elements had conspired to impel me to some onward step.

500|$|By {{the end of}} 1872, the {{appearance}} and function of the typewriter had assumed the form that would become standard in the industry and remain largely unchanged for the next century. Although the machine possessed a cylindrical platen and what was essentially a QWERTY keyboard, two design elements that would later become essential were lacking: the ability to write in upper and lowercase letters and [...] "visible" [...] print. Although the former was implemented in the Remington No.2, the machine was fundamentally an [...] "upstrike" [...] design, meaning the typebars struck upwards against {{the underside of the}} platen. As this occurred inside the machine, the operator could <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> was being entered as it was typed.

When the Alabama bill came to the floor, Vestal yielded time for a statement in favor from Rainey, which began with a brief explanation of the bill followed by a much longer paean to the glorious history of his home state, and his conclusion drew applause. Gard then questioned Vestal, and learned that another coin, the Pilgrim one, was next on the House's agenda.

500|$|Kruger did {{not meet}} Queen Victoria, though such an {{audience}} is described in numerous anecdotes, depicted in films and sometimes reported as fact. Between August and October he visited the Netherlands and Germany, where he aroused little general public interest, but made a potent impact in the Reformed congregations he visited. After a brief sojourn back in England he returned to South Africa and arrived at Boekenhoutfontein shortly before Christmas 1877. He found a national awakening occurring. [...] "Paradoxically", John Laband writes, [...] "British occupation seemed to be fomenting a sense of national consciousness in the Transvaal which years of fractious independence had failed to elicit." [...] When Kruger visited Pretoria in January 1878 he was greeted by a procession that {{took him to a}} mass gathering in Church Square. Attempting to stir up the crowd, Kruger said that since Carnarvon had told him the annexation would not be revoked he could <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> more they could do. The gambit worked; burghers began shouting that they would sooner die fighting for their country than submit to the British.|$|E
500|$|After Rovelstad {{submitted}} his {{designs for}} the coin to the Mint, they {{were sent to the}} Commission of Fine Arts for its opinion. [...] The designs arrived on July 15, 1936, and were approved two days later, with the request that the head of the pioneer on the obverse, in three-quarter view (facing forward and to one side) as submitted by Rovelstad, be in profile instead. [...] The sculptor complied, and submitted plaster models by mid-August; photographs were sent to the commission by the Mint on August 15. [...] Two days later, commission chairman Charles Moore wrote to O'Reilly, stating that the sculptor member of the commission, Lee Lawrie, had viewed the designs, and complained he could <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> the object was behind the pioneers, and that the gun appeared to be held awkwardly. [...] Lawrie also stated that some of the lettering should be strengthened, but if the Mint director, Nellie Tayloe Ross, was not disturbed by these things, the coin should go forward. [...] Moore indicated that he had no desire to delay the coin, and forwarded the commission's recommendation, on condition that the Mint do what it could to address these concerns. With the exception of possible work on the lettering, no changes were made.|$|E

500|$|Robinson's {{election}} and consecration prompted {{a group of}} 19 bishops, led by Robert Duncan, Bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, {{to make a statement}} warning the church of a possible schism between the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion.

[...] He added: [...] "t is my hope that the church in America and the rest of the Anglican Communion will have the opportunity to consider this development before significant and irrevocable decisions are made in response." [...] Desmond Tutu, Archbishop emeritus of Cape Town, stated that he did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> [...] "all the fuss" [...] was about, saying the election would not roil the Church of the Province of Southern Africa. Other senior bishops of the church, like Peter Akinola, Archbishop of the Church of Nigeria and head of the Global South, have made Robinson a figurehead in their dispute with the Episcopal Church.
