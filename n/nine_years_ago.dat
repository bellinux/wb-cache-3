25|$|Bombay breezed {{through the}} West Zone league of the 1993–94 Ranji trophy winning all four matches– {{a very rare}} feat – by big margins. With the Test players away, Shastri captained the young team in the {{knockout}} matches. Bombay defeated Haryana by an innings and 202 runs in the pre quarter final but ran into trouble against Karnataka in the next round. Against 406, Bombay lost their first six for 174, before Shastri and Sairaj Bahutule added 259 in six hours. Shastri's individual score was 151. Bombay survived {{the best part of}} the last day to win on first innings lead. Shastri scored 612 runs in the season and took 17 wickets at 15. Bombay went on to beat Bengal in a low scoring final to lift the Ranji trophy. It was their first championship since the famous win against Delhi <b>nine</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E
25|$|In April, Radwańska {{began her}} clay {{season at the}} Porsche Tennis Grand Prix as the 7th seed. She lost in {{straight}} sets to Ekaterina Makarova in the first round. She later withdrew from her forthcoming tournaments in Madrid and Rome, citing a foot injury. At the French Open Radwańska was seeded at No.9. In her first match after being sidelined for five weeks due to a right foot injury she eased past Fiona Ferro in straight sets in just over an hour. In the second round she defeated Belgium’s Alison Van Uytvanck to face Alizé Cornet in the third round. Radwańska had won seven of their eight previous matches, including {{the only one on}} clay - at the French Open <b>nine</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> - but this time lost to Cornet in two sets. Radwanska withdrew from the Ricoh Open and Aegon Classic Birmingham due to a viral illness. She came into the 2017 Aegon International as the No. 9 seed but fell to Lauren Davis. Radwańska then started her Wimbledon Championships campaign where she defeated Jelena Janković, Christina McHale and Timea Bacsinszky before falling to Svetlana Kuznetsova in the fourth round.|$|E

50|$|The genus Microcebus {{is shown}} to have diverged {{approximately}} ten to <b>nine</b> million <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> This split allowed for greater radiation of mouse lemurs.

[...] After Picard fails to get the reference, Data (Brent Spiner) reminds him that <b>nine</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> at Maxia, he was attacked by an unidentified aggressor which he destroyed. Bok angrily shouts that ship in question was Ferengi. The ship is identified as the U.S.S. Stargazer, Picard's former command. Bok explains that he found the ship as a derelict and offers it to Picard for free. Picard explains that at Maxia, the Stargazer was heavily damaged before Picard executed an action which would {{come to be known as}} the [...] "Picard Maneuver". Using the warp drive, Picard ordered a short warp jump directly resulting in the enemy vessel's light speed based sensors briefly detecting the ship in two places at once and allowing Picard to win the battle. Due to the damage, the crew of the Stargazer abandoned ship after the battle.|$|E
500|$|AOL's Benji Eisen called [...] "On the Floor" [...] a [...] "comeback of sorts" [...] for Lopez, {{particularly}} noting its clever cross-promotion with Idol and Lopez's multiple product endorsement deals. He applauded Lopez {{for moving}} on from her previous lack of commercial success in recent years. Kim Dawson, an {{editor for the}} UK daily newspaper Daily Star, also praised the video for returning Lopez to her [...] "day job" [...] (as a performer) despite being everyone's [...] "new favourite Idol judge." [...] The sex appeal in the video for [...] "On the Floor" [...] was likened to that last displayed by Lopez in the video for 2002's [...] "I'm Gonna Be Alright". A reviewer from the Daily Express said [...] "Jennifer Lopez once told us in song that 'I'm Gonna Be Alright' and now she's proved it... The curves she displayed when she recorded the hit video <b>nine</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> {{have been replaced by}} a leaner, fitter look [...]" [...] Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone agreed with comparisons to Lopez's earlier work: [...] "Basically, this is classic Lopez tweaked for 2011... visuals that update late-Nineties bling with a high fashion wardrobe nearly as eccentric as that of Rihanna and Lady Gaga." [...] As a result of the video's premiere, the online traffic at Lopez's official Vevo account increased by 1000%. In the space of two weeks, the video was viewed over thirty million times on Lopez's official Vevo page, according to USA Today.|$|E

50|$|Paternal haplogroups N1c-Tat and R1a are the {{two most}} frequent, {{reaching}} 39.9% each among ethnic Latvians. N1c-Tat mutation probably originated in South Siberia eight to <b>nine</b> thousand <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> and had spread through the Urals into the Europe where it is currently most common among Finno-Ugric and Baltic people. Balts, however, differ from Finno-Ugrics by the predominance of the N1c-L550 branch of N1c-Tat. Haplogroup R1a is associated with the spread of Indo-European languages.|$|R
5000|$|The Grande Ronde Valley {{is part of}} the Columbia River Plateau. The Columbia River Plateau {{was created}} by a series of basalt flood eruptions.

2500|$|Numerous instances, over 300 {{reported}} annually, {{of forced}} marriage involving British citizens married {{against their will}} in Pakistani Kashmir occur each year, especially about the industrial town of Mirpur with a large diaspora in British cities like Bradford, Glasgow and London. Claiming to preserve their culture and traditions, some diaspora families prefer to send their daughters back to Kashmir to be forcefully wedded off.

25|$|The {{final phase}} of eruptive {{activity}} was effusive in nature with no explosive activity (VEI-0). This effusive volcanism produced lava flows with well-preserved lava channels on the northwest and southwest flanks of Hoodoo Mountain in the early Holocene epoch and are largely unglaciated, suggesting the final eruptive phase occurred in an ice-free environment. These lava flows originated from the mountain's flat-topped summit and volcanic vents on its flanks. Geologists do not always agree on the dates of these more recent eruptions, some dating them to <b>nine</b> thousand <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> others to as recently as seven thousand <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|R

50|$|Conditions {{favourable}} {{for human}} settlement {{occurred in the}} present Wyrzysk Region in the postglacial period. Its relics are now left on the moraine hills along the Noteć River.

Those wooden bridges in the vicinity of present Żuławka were maintained by people settling in this area for the following 3,500 years, which is a unique example of engineering skills in prehistoric Europe.|$|R
50|$|The natural lakes of {{the region}} were formed about <b>nine</b> {{thousand}} <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> as glaciers left Quebec after having scoured the Canadian Shield for ninety thousand years. The prototype of these lakes was an ice dam lake that drained southwards into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence {{at a time when}} areas further north (Nunavik) were still glaciated. As post-glacial rebound elevated {{the southern part of the}} Canadian Shield more rapidly than the north, the region began to drain northward into the Caniapiscau River, a tributary of the Koksoak River, and ultimately into Ungava Bay.|$|R
50|$|HIP 13044 {{is a red}} horizontal-branch star about 2,300 {{light years}} (700 pc) from Earth in the {{constellation}} Fornax.

HIP 13044 is slightly less massive than the Sun, but is approximately seven times its size. The star, which is estimated to be at least <b>nine</b> billion <b>years</b> old, has passed the red-giant phase. The relatively fast rotation of the star may be due to having engulfed one or more planets during the red-giant phase.|$|R
