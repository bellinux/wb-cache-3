40|$|According {{to safety}} {{observations}} from motorway operators in the United Kingdom, the hard-shoulder is occasionally violated by road users travelling in the <b>nearside</b> <b>lane.</b> These unintentional movements (hard-shoulder incursions) can impose risk to operatives performing {{activities on the}} network. To further investigate these events, a sensor-based system {{can be used for}} monitoring them and collecting related data such as severity of incursion and vehicle classification. A review of vehicle detection technologies that could be applied for this purpose is presented, along with the criteria for selection of the most suitable technology and implementation sites. Two potential non-intrusive systems are also described, a laser- and a radar-based systems, which provide different levels of flexibility and data...|$|E
40|$|AbstractProblemThe {{severity}} of motorway accidents that {{occurred on the}} hard shoulder (HS) is higher than for the main carriageway (MC). This paper compares and contrasts {{the most important factors}} affecting the {{severity of}} HS and MC accidents on motorways in England. MethodUsing police reported accident data, the accidents that occurred on motorways in England are grouped into two categories (i. e., HS and MC) according to the location. A generalized ordered logistic regression model is then applied to identify the factors affecting the severity of HS and MC accidents on motorways. The factors examined include accident and vehicle characteristics, traffic and environment conditions, as well as other behavioral factors. ResultsResults suggest that the factors positively affecting the severity include: number of vehicles involved in the accident, peak-hour traffic time, and low visibility. Differences between HS and MC accidents are identified, with the most important being the involvement of heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) and driver fatigue, which are found to be more crucial in increasing the severity of HS accidents.

5000|$|The {{road was}} built in the 1930s and known as the [...] "Shotwick - Helsby Bypass". It formed a link between Manchester, the North West and North Wales via the Queensferry Lifting bridge, the A550 and the A494, to join the A55 at Ewloe. Some {{sections}} were constructed in concrete. The road was lined for much of its length with poplar trees. This original tree lined boulevard layout is still in evidence on the section adjacent to Stanlow Refinery. In the 1960s it was marked out as a single carriageway 3-lane road. The middle lane was known as the [...] "suicide" [...] lane due to overtaking vehicles from each direction heading towards each other at speed. Vehicles in the <b>nearside</b> <b>lanes</b> would experience an up and down vertical motion due to the need for [...] "summit and valley" [...] drainage on this otherwise flat section of road.|$|R
5000|$|Although waiting cyclists {{might be}} safer {{out in front}} of HGVs, {{concerns}} have been expressed about <b>nearside</b> cycle <b>lanes</b> approaching such intersections may encourage cyclists to [...] "creep up" [...] on the inside of turning HGVs. Collisions with turning HGVs are strongly associated with a high risk of death and serious injury. [...] The 1997 edition of Cyclecraft by John Franklin advises cyclists that they should use such feeder lanes only if the traffic signal is red. If the signal is green, cyclists are advised {{that the best way to}} minimize danger may be to stay within the main traffic stream. If the lights change while the cyclist is still approaching, the advice is to negotiate their way back into the main traffic stream if possible. Advice produced by RoSPA regarding cyclists and lorries (large trucks) cautions cyclists that even though a junction has an ASL it may be better to hang back if there is a lorry (large truck) present.|$|R
50|$|The tunnel is 3.24 km long. It {{contains}} a single carriageway of four lanes, two in each direction. Different height restrictions {{apply to the}} <b>nearside</b> and offside <b>lanes</b> in each direction, because of the curvature of the tunnel. These are 3.9 m and 4.75 m respectively, {{and there is a}} 3.5 t weight limit for goods vehicles. All buses are required to use the offside lane, regardless of their height. Lane signals (consisting of an illuminated green arrow or red cross) are displayed at regular intervals, although in normal circumstances none of the lanes are currently used bidirectionally. This is in contrast to the Kingsway Tunnel, where lanes in toll concourse are alternated to prioritise higher traffic in one direction during peak hours.|$|R
40|$|In traffic systems where {{driving is}} on the left, right-turning {{movements}} tend {{to be difficult to}} efficiently accommodate at signal controlled junctions. A hook turn is one potential solution for this. A hook turn is where a right turn is made from the <b>nearside</b> <b>lane</b> rather than an offside lane at a four-leg signalised junction. After entering the junction, the turning vehicle waits at a nearside position in front of the side road stop line, and then proceeds toward the exit arm when the side road signal turns green The research described in this paper uses microscopic simulation modelling in an innovative way to compare the traffic performance of a hypothetical hook-turn junction with an equivalent conventional junction with opposed right turns. The simulation model evaluated traffic performance under various combinations of demand flow, turning proportions, and signal timings. It was found that hook turns reduced delays to through traffic from the same approach in nearly all cases. Overall junction performance depended on the scale of any increased delays to left-turning traffic and side road traffic resulting from the hook-turn movement. It is concluded that hook turns could be used much more widely than at present—including where driving {{is on the}} right—offering significant operational benefits in the right circumstances...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{reports the}} {{distributions}} of noise level maxima, LAFmax, generated during the pass-by of over 85 000 vehicles in service on urban arterials and motorways. These were measured under normal traffic and vehicle operating conditions on multilane roadways. They {{are indicative of}} the instantaneous maximum noise levels that would be experienced in the free field at the set-back distance of the facades of the first row of many dwellings fronting urban roadways in Australia, from vehicles travelling in the <b>nearside</b> <b>lane.</b> Noise levels are reported separately for four classes of vehicle and for roadways with five different posted speed limits. Results have been standardised as free-field levels 15 m from the centreline of vehicle travel. The data were collected in Brisbane but can be assumed to be representative of noise level maxima from vehicles operating throughout Australia. Maximum noise levels increase with vehicle class (from cars through to articulated trucks) and with roadway speed limits. The within-vehicle-class variance is large and the distributions of maxima from different vehicle classes overlap extensively. Sound Power Levels of the observed vehicles agree well with those from the European IMAGINE emission model. This investigation contributes essential information regarding the source and levels of noise events adjacent to urban road networks - the likely determinant of human sleep disturbance.

50|$|On 10 September 2011, Bakkerud was {{involved}} in a car crash at the Tibbet's Corner roundabout at Putney Heath, near Wimbledon Common. He died a day later, in St George's Hospital, from his injuries. He was driving an Audi RS6 {{at the time of the}} accident; a police investigation is ongoing. Travelling south on the A219 on Tibbet's Ride from Putney Hill, the car appeared to fail to negotiate a left turn into the large roundabout itself and instead travelled onwards and hit a thick, 1.5 m high concrete barrier on the inside of the dual lane roundabout. The car then flipped over the barrier, fell down a steep 3 m grass incline before smashing through the steel fence separating the bridleway and pedestrian/cyclist underpass routes. Crash investigators used yellow spray paint to mark skid and impact points on the road and where the car flipped over the barrier. The straight skid marks showed his car crossed from <b>nearside</b> to inside <b>lane,</b> as the road veered left at the roundabout entry, before it made a glancing blow on a heavy steel crash barrier prior to the barrier impact some six metres later.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, a micro-simulation {{model is}} put forward to make {{evaluation}} of traffic flow characteristics including safety condition. The model has some advantages over the classic CA model. A partial test {{has been conducted}} and the validity of our model is preliminarily verified. Future work can focus on the following aspects. First, some basic assumptions can be loosened. The probability distribution of the arrival of vehicles, for example, can be calibrated through real traffic flow data instead of Poisson distribution assumption. Second, methods to determine the model parameters can be focused on. Visibility {{is probably one of}} the most important factors that make a great difference to the proposed four characteristic distance. Third, the validity of our model requires further and more rigorous verifications. One possible method is to calculate the actual capacity of targeted freeway section on the basis of basic capacity, and comparison can be made between the calculation and the results obtained by our simulation. Another method is based on real flow data. Comparing, the data with the simulation results including speed, density, and delay, the validity of the model will be more strictly proved. Finally, multilane freeway traffic simulation can be achieved though the rules of vehicle state update in this study ought to be slightly revised. Taking three-lane freeway as an example, rules such that small cars never run in the right (<b>nearside)</b> <b>lane</b> while large cars never run in the left (fast) lane are necessary to make an extension of the proposed micro-simulation model.|$|E
40|$|Motorway merging {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as {{a major source of}} conflicts and congestion on motorways. Traditional studies of merging behaviour are based on gap acceptance models developed mainly for urban intersections, which tend to oversimplify the very complex dynamic interactive merging behaviour involved. It is believed that this research represents the first comprehensive investigation and modelling of dynamic merging interactions at motorway on-ramps. Emphasis has been given to improving the modelling of merging behaviour and in particular to capture the cooperation between the merging and motorway traffic. This research has developed a feasible integrated microscopic simulation framework to model the interactions among traffic in motorway merging sections. This has been achieved by developing an integrated model (MergeSim) consisting of two sub-models working in tandem: a car-following and a merging model. By assuming different reaction times for different driver states (alert, non-alert and close-following), the new car-following model is shown to be able to capture traffic breakdown, hysteresis, shockwave propagations and close-following situations. The merging model is developed to capture both the acceleration and gap acceptance behaviour of the merging traffic, and the cooperative behaviour of the motorway traffic. The merging model is composed of several sub models: for the traffic in the motorway <b>nearside</b> <b>lane,</b> there is a cooperation model to simulate the cooperative lane-changing and courtesy yielding behaviour and the interactions with the merging traffic; for the merging traffic in the acceleration lane, there are models such as acceleration model, gap selection model, gap acceptance model and a merge model. Sensitivity tests have shown that the integrated model can reasonably replicate all relevant behaviour of individual drivers in merging areas such as normal carfollowing, close-following, cooperative lane-changing, courtesy yielding and gap acceptance. The sensitivity tests on the different merging lengths showed that increased length might reduce merging failures (i. e. the occurrence that the merging driver fails to move into the motorway before reaching the end of the acceleration lane). It can be explained that more merging traffic can successfully take the following gaps with increased merging lengths, which has implications for the geometric configuration of the acceleration lane. The study also established a general calibration and validation framework designed for real-world applications in highway networks using the most readily available traffic surveillance data, the loop detector data. Currently no commonly agreed bench-marking procedure exists (Brockfeld et al., 2005), and this framework has the advantage that the concept and the proposed methodology are suitable for general application to other micro-simulation models using detector data sets. In conclusion, the integrated simulation model (MergeSim) can reliably be used as a tool for further studies and investigations into the effectiveness of techniques related to motorway merging operations.
