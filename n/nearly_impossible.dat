Therefore, uranium was positioned below tungsten in group VI, and thorium below zirconium in group IV, leaving the space below tantalum in group V empty and, until the 1950s, periodic tables were published with this structure. For a long time chemists searched for eka-tantalum as an element with similar chemical properties to tantalum, making a discovery of protactinium <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible.</b> Tantalum's heavier analogue was later found to be the transuranic element dubnium.|$|E

40|$|Balancing loss is the {{quantification}} of {{the lack}} of balance in a production line, defined as the percentage of time not used for productive purposes with the total time invested in making a product.

50|$|Single-molecule {{techniques}} impacted optics, electronics, biology, and chemistry. In {{the biological}} sciences, {{the study of}} proteins and other complex biological machinery was limited to ensemble experiments that <b>nearly</b> made <b>impossible</b> the direct observation of their kinetics.

These experiments, however, have for the most part been limited to in vitro studies, as useful techniques for live cell imaging have yet to be fully realized. The promise of single molecule in vivo imaging, however, brings with it an enormous potential to directly observe bio-molecules in native processes. These techniques are often targeted for studies involving low-copy proteins, many of which are still being discovered. These techniques have also been extended to study areas of chemistry, including the mapping of heterogeneous surfaces.|$|R

40|$|Every {{reversible}} Markov chain defines {{an operator}} whose spectrum encodes the convergence {{properties of the}} chain. When the state space is finite, the spectrum is just the set of eigenvalues of the corresponding Markov transition matrix. However, when the state space is infinite, the spectrum may be uncountable, and is <b>nearly</b> always <b>impossible</b> to calculate. In most applications of the data augmentation (DA) algorithm, the state space of the DA Markov chain is infinite. However, we show that, under regularity conditions that include the finiteness of the augmented space, the operators defined by the DA chain and Hobert and Marchev’s (2008) alternative chain are both compact, and the corresponding spectra are both finite subsets of [0, 1). Moreover, we prove that the spectrum of Hobert and Marchev’s (2008) chain dominates the spectrum of the DA chain {{in the sense that}} the ordered elements of the former are all less than or equal to the corresponding elements of the latter. As a concrete example, we study a widely used DA algorithm for the exploration of posterior densities associated with Bayesian mixture models (Diebolt and Robert, 1994).

30|$|In {{additional}} to the supplemental BIM data, {{additional information}} {{is used to}} adjust each location estimation. The received signal strength indicator (RSSI) paired with the antenna of each tag read are also used to provide {{the location of the}} tag relative to the reader (Eq.  1). For example, if antenna # 3 reads a tag at high RSSI, the tag has high probability it will be {{on the left side of}} the cart. Additionally, if antenna # 3 reads a tag with low RSSI, the tag may be further away from the cart or even result from multipath. There are distance factors, based on testing (see Power output and received signal strength), which are placed depending on the RSSI value. These factors give high RSSI values higher probability of being closer to reader. Next, the algorithm uses previous locations to estimate the probability of the current location (Eq.  2). For instance using certain thresholds (e.g. time and location), it would <b>nearly</b> be <b>impossible</b> to be at one location and jump to another location in a minimal amount of time. This can be seen in the jaggedness of the paths in Figs.  12 a, 13 a and 14 a of the results section, which have not incorporated this portion of the algorithm.

5|$|Cubic {{diamonds}} have {{a perfect}} and easy octahedral cleavage, {{which means that they}} only have four planes—weak directions following the faces of the octahedron where there are fewer bonds—along which diamond can easily split upon blunt impact to leave a smooth surface. Similarly, diamond's hardness is markedly directional: the hardest direction is the diagonal on the cube face, 100 times harder than the softest direction, which is the dodecahedral plane. The octahedral plane is intermediate between the two extremes. The diamond cutting process relies heavily on this directional hardness, as without it a diamond would be <b>nearly</b> <b>impossible</b> to fashion.

40|$|Throughout {{this book}} the {{emphasis}} is on specific detailsof operative techniques in hand surgery. The purpose of thisintroductory chapter is to briefly discuss some of the ele-ments that are common to all operations on the hand. The scope of hand surgery is broad and requires a wide range of diverse operative skills. The hand surgeon must be equally facile at suturing together a tiny vessel 1 mm in diameter and fashioning a corticocancellous bone graft into a specific configuration. In all hand surgery procedures, however, one theme is dominant: careful attention to detail and precise, gentle technique are essential for success. In a remarkably prescient article in 1921, Sterling Bunnell 9 emphasized the importance of atraumatic technique in hand surgery. Modern advances in magnification have allowed us to clearly see how damaging to delicate tissues even the most careful and precise attempts at dissection can be. At the same time, refinements in instruments have pro-vided us with improved methods for striving to more <b>nearly</b> achieve the <b>impossible</b> dream of truly atraumatic surgery...|$|R
