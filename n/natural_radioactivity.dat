5|$|All of the {{alkali metals}} except lithium and caesium {{have at least}} one {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope: sodium-22 and sodium-24 are trace radioisotopes produced cosmogenically, potassium-40 and rubidium-87 have very long half-lives and thus occur naturally, and all isotopes of francium are radioactive. Caesium was also thought to be radioactive in the early 20th century, although it has no naturally occurring radioisotopes. (Francium had not been discovered yet at that time.) The natural long-lived radioisotope of potassium, potassium-40, makes up about 0.012% of natural potassium, and thus natural potassium is weakly radioactive. This <b>natural</b> <b>radioactivity</b> became a basis for a mistaken claim of the discovery for element 87 (the next alkali metal after caesium) in 1925. Natural rubidium is similarly slightly radioactive, with 27.83% being the long-lived radioisotope rubidium-87.|$|E
5|$|The <b>natural</b> <b>radioactivity</b> {{of thorium}} and uranium {{made it hard}} to {{determine}} what was happening when these elements were bombarded with neutrons but, after correctly eliminating the presence of elements lighter than uranium but heavier than lead, Fermi concluded that they had created new elements, which he called hesperium and ausonium. The chemist Ida Noddack criticised this work, suggesting that some of the experiments could have produced lighter elements than lead rather than new, heavier elements. Her suggestion was not taken seriously at the time because her team had not carried out any experiments with uranium, and its claim to have discovered masurium (technetium) was disputed. At that time, fission was thought to be improbable if not impossible on theoretical grounds. While physicists expected elements with higher atomic numbers to form from neutron bombardment of lighter elements, nobody expected neutrons to have enough energy to split a heavier atom into two light element fragments in the manner that Noddack suggested.|$|E

The two main sources of natural radiation exposure are from terrestrial radionuclides and cosmogenic radionuclides. They lead to external and internal radiation exposure. This study focused on levels of radioactivity due terrestrial radionuclides.

After human processing that exposes or concentrates this <b>natural</b> <b>radioactivity</b> (such as mining bringing coal to the surface or burning it to produce concentrated ash), it becomes technologically enhanced {{naturally occurring radioactive material}} (TENORM). A lot of this waste is alpha particle-emitting matter from the decay chains of uranium and thorium. The main source of radiation in the human body is potassium-40 (40K), typically 17 milligrams in the body at a time and 0.4 milligrams/day intake. Most rocks, due to their components, have a low level of radioactivity. Usually ranging from 1 millisievert (mSv) to 13mSv annually depending on location, average radiation exposure from natural radioisotopes is 2.0mSv per person a year worldwide. This makes up the majority of typical total dosage (with mean annual exposure from other sources amounting to 0.6mSv from medical tests averaged over the whole populace, 0.4mSv from cosmic rays, 0.005mSv from the legacy of past atmospheric nuclear testing, 0.005mSv occupational exposure, 0.002mSv from the Chernobyl disaster, and 0.0002mSv from the nuclear fuel cycle).|$|E

This is the same distribution of elements as found naturally on very deep seabeds, but the geochemical evidence suggests that the origin of these elements is extreme weathering of coral and brief sea submergence 120,000 years ago. Endothermal upwelling, by which mild volcanic heat draws deep seawater up through the porous coral, may also contribute.|$|E

Following the Chernobyl accident many European countries have installed monitoring networks to perform this task.

We evaluated each contribution ratio of the field shift effect and the hyperfine splitting shift effect to the mass effect of the calcium isotopes for the first time. The present preliminary result suggests the contribution of the field shift effect is small, especially for 40 Ca − 48 Ca case, compared with the case of Chromium trichloride-crown in which the isotope enrichment factors are strongly affected by the field shifts. These indications are promising towards the mass producion of enriched 48 Ca by the chemical separation method. 1 Double Beta Decay of 48 Ca and Chemical Separation of Calcium Isotopes Among ββ isotopes, the Q-value of 48 Ca is the highest (4. 27 MeV), which is far above energies of γ-rays from <b>natural</b> <b>radioactivities,</b> therefore our measurement is not limited by backgrounds in the energy region at 4. 27 MeV.
