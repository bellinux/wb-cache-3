40|$|Direct-driven {{permanent}} magnet synchronous generator {{is one of}} the most promising topologies for megawatt-range wind power applications. The rotational speed of the direct-driven generator is very low compared with the traditional electrical machines. The low rotational speed requires high torque to produce megawatt-range power. The special features of the direct-driven generators caused by the low speed and high torque are discussed in this doctoral thesis. Low speed and high torque set high demands on the torque quality. The cogging torque and the load torque ripple must be as low as possible to prevent mechanical failures. In this doctoral thesis, various methods to improve the torque quality are compared with each other. The rotor surface shaping, magnet skew, magnet shaping, and the asymmetrical placement of magnets and stator slots are studied not only by means of torque quality, but also the effects on the electromagnetic performance and manufacturability of the machine are discussed. The heat transfer of the direct-driven generator must be designed to handle the copper losses of the stator winding carrying high current density and to keep the temperature of the magnets low enough. The cooling system of the direct-driven generator applying the doubly radial air cooling with numerous radial cooling ducts was modeled with a lumped-parameter-based thermal network. The performance of the cooling system was discussed during the steady and transient states. The effect of the number and width of radial cooling ducts was explored. The large number of radial cooling ducts drastically increases the impact of the stack end area effects, because the stator stack consists of numerous substacks. The effects of the radial cooling ducts on the effective axial length of the machine were studied by analyzing the crosssection of the machine in the axial direction.

When a pulsating carrier-signal voltage is injected in an estimated synchronous frame, the envelope of the resulting HF current measured in the stationary reference frame follows an amplitude-modulated pattern. Using this information, the IAS technique allows avoiding multiple zero-crossings of HF currents by adjusting the current phase angle according to the load condition. At <b>no-load,</b> the pulsating <b>voltage</b> is injected only on the d-axis while the d-axis current is controlled to a certain nonzero value.

40|$|Abstract- This paper proposes an {{injection}} axis switching (IAS) sensorless control using a pulsating HF signal to minimize ZCC effect for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM). When a pulsating carrier-signal voltage is injected in a synchronous frame, the envelope {{of the resulting}} HF current measured in the stationary reference frame follows an oscillating pattern with a maximum to zero magnitude. Taking this effect into account, multiple zero-crossings of HF currents around the zero-crossing region can be avoided by adjusting the current phase angle according to the load condition. For this purpose, we develop {{an injection}} axis switching scheme according to the load condition. At <b>no-load,</b> the pulsating <b>voltage</b> is injected only on the d-axis while the d-axis current is controlled to a certain nonzero value.

Such a rotor construction gives rise to an inverse saliency effect (i. e., the direct-axis synchronous reactance {{is less than the}} quadrature-axis synchronous reactance). This feature results in an improvement in the voltage regulation characteristics when the generator supplies an isolated, unity-power-factor load. By solving the equations derived from the two-axis theory, it is found that there exists, in general, two values of load current at which zero voltage regulation is obtained.

40|$|A {{complete}} laboratory breadboard {{version of}} a ion engine power converter was built and tested. This prototype operated on a line voltage of 80 - 120 Vdc, and provided output ratings of 1100 V at 1. 8 kW, and 250 V at 20 mA. The high-voltage (HV) output voltage rating was revised from the original value of 1350 V {{at the beginning of}} the project. The LV output was designed to hold up during a 1 -A surge current lasting up to 1 second. The prototype power converter included a internal housekeeping power supply which also operated from the line input. The power consumed in housekeeping was included in the overall energy budget presented for the ion engine converter. HV and LV output voltage setpoints were commanded through potentiometers. The HV converter itself reached its highest power efficiency of slightly over 93 % at low line and maximum output. This would dip below 90 % at high line. The <b>no-load</b> (rated output <b>voltages,</b> zero load current) power consumption of the entire system was less than 13 W. A careful loss breakdown shows that converter losses are predominately Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) conduction losses and HV rectifier snubbing losses, with the rectifier snubbing losses becoming predominant at high line. This suggests that further improvements in power efficiency could best be obtained by either developing a rectifier that was adequately protected against voltage overshoot with less snubbing, or by developing a pre-regulator to reduced the range of line voltage on the converter. The transient testing showed the converter to be fully protected against load faults, including a direct short-circuit from the HV output to the LV output terminals. Two currents sensors were used: one to directly detect any core ratcheting on the output transformer and re-initiate a soft start, and the other to directly detect a load fault and quickly shut down the converter for load protection.

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} the above sections, the GFD {{inverter}} behaves as constant power source and it participates neither in voltage regulation nor in load variations sharing. The GFM inverter behaves as constant voltage source and it is responsible not only for maintaining the microgrid’s voltage and frequency, but also for keeping power balance. Load sharing among the GFM inverters is a function of the impedances between the inverters and microgrid bus. The PQ-droop and ωU-droop GS inverters can be regarded as the upgraded version of the GFD and GFM inverters, and they behave as controlled power source and controlled voltage source, respectively. When the microgrid operation conditions change, they can adaptively adjust the output power or voltage to achieve a more flexible load sharing. Currently the most promising control method is the ωU-droop control, because it can make the system autonomy and achieve seamless mode switching. When the microgrid is operated in islanded mode, any addition or reduction of a single ωU-droop GS inverter do not influence the configuration of the original system. When the microgrid operated in grid-connected mode, the ωU-droop GS inverter can output the specified power by modifying its <b>no-load</b> <b>voltage</b> and frequency. However, this autonomous control method is not widely applied among numerous experimental microgrids, because there still exist many practical problems, such as the dynamic response speed, the impact of control parameters on system stability, the capability to deal with unbalanced and non-linear loads, and control strategies under fault conditions. In addition, it {{can be seen}} from the above analysis that the performance of the ωU-droop GS inverter operating with no communication is inferior. In order to enhance the accuracy of reactive load sharing, it is worthwhile to study the design of the control algorithms with reduced communication requirements.|$|E
