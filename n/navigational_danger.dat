5|$|Some seamounts {{have not}} been mapped and thus pose a <b>navigational</b> <b>danger.</b> For instance, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that hit it in 1973. More recently, the {{submarine}} USS San Francisco ran into an uncharted seamount in 2005 at a speed of , sustaining serious damage and killing one seaman.|$|E
50|$|Halifax Harbour was an {{extremely}} busy port during the Second World War. Because of this, <b>navigational</b> <b>dangers</b> increased with the congestion in the harbour. The Naval Service of Canada, which kept records of the activity in the harbour, advised that from 1940 to 1943, {{there were at least}} 12 vessels involved in accidents within Halifax Harbour. Vessels such as Camperdown, Claire Lilley and Nueva Indalucia ran aground, whereas others such as Otter, and Trongate caught fire and sank (or, in the case of Trongate, was made to sink as the flames were completely out of control). In 1940, Herbidean was sunk by the British ship Esmond; a forerunner to the fate of Erg.|$|R
40|$|A Marine Electronic Highway (MEH) {{has been}} {{proposed}} for the Straits of Malacca and Singapore in South East Asia. When fully operational, the highway will incorporate the real-time flow of maritime information between data collection posts, shore-based users and vessels at sea, and display this value-added data upon an electronic navigational chart (ENC). This dissertation investigates the impact the proposed MEH will have upon the hydrographic survey process. This includes the products that will be required, alterations to {{the current system of}} collection of hydrographic data, the processing of such, and the dissemination of this data to the users of the MEH. As part of the research, an extensive period of hydrographic surveying in SE Asia identified the current realisation of the proposed MEH and the actions necessary for fiirther development from the hydrographic perspective. The dissertation describes the difficulties faced during data collection, in particular the interaction with other vessels, and proposes ways of allowing hydrographic surveys to proceed economically and expeditiously despite this. It was identified that to ftmction as proposed, the MEH requires charts and ENCs compiled from full seabed coverage surveys. Once completed, the mature MEH should facilitate the dissemination of the crucial elements of these surveys, such as <b>navigational</b> <b>dangers</b> and tidal data in real time. The remaining bathymetric data, having passed through the necessary quality controls and checks, can be used to route and re-route traffic to enable deconfliction of incompatible activities between users of the straits. The dissertation concludes with a discussion on the alterations possible to both the hydrographic process and the MEH post survey, and how an increased knowledge of the marine environment will further enhance the MEH by allowing innovative and dynamic control of vessel movement. Correctly targeted fiinding, industry compliance and proactive government poUcy are the keys {{to the success of the}} MEH in SE Asia and in other areas of high vessel density around the world.
