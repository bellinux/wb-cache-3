The Rateau employs simple impulse rotors {{separated by a}} <b>nozzle</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> The diaphragm is essentially a partition wall in the turbine {{with a series of}} tunnels cut into it, funnel shaped with the broad end facing the previous stage and the narrow the next they are also angled to direct the steam jets onto the impulse rotor.|$|E

40|$|Efficiency {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} on a single-stage impulse engine having an 11 -inch pitch-line diameter wheel with inserted buckets and a fabricated <b>nozzle</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> The tests were made {{to determine the effect}} of inlet pressure, Inlet temperature, speed, and pressure ratio on the turbine efficiency. An analysis is presented that relates the effect of inlet pressure and temperature to the Reynolds number of the flow. The agreement between the analysis and the experimental data indicates that the changes in turbine efficiency with Inlet pressure and temperature may be principally a Reynolds number effect...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} {{vertical}} assembled sprayer for supplying water and liquid fertilizer. This proposed sprayer consists of both iron structure and hardware modules, including a microcon-troller, LCD, keypad, batteries, <b>nozzles,</b> and <b>diaphragm</b> pumps. The height of this proposed sprayer ranges from 1. 5 to 4. 5 meters {{so as to}} be adjusted by a user. The water quantity and the nozzle numbers can be specified by a userâ€™s demand. Moreover, either manual or automatic operations can also be selected by a user. The experimental results have been shown that the average spraying times for using 1 - 4 nozzles are equal to 95. 2 sec, 48. 41 sec, 32. 3 sec, and 24. 5 sec, respectively. Moreover, the average spraying times from the experiments are close to the calculated spraying time of microcontroller where the errors are less than 2 %...|$|R
50|$|A Ludwieg tube is a {{wind tunnel}} that {{produces}} supersonic flow {{for short periods}} of time. A large evacuated dump tank is separated from the downstream end of a convergent-divergent <b>nozzle</b> by a <b>diaphragm</b> or fast acting valve. The upstream end of the nozzle connects to a long cylindrical tube, whose cross-sectional area is significantly larger than the throat area of the nozzle. Initially, the pressure in the nozzle and tube is high. To start the tunnel, the diaphragm is ruptured, e.g., by piercing it with a suitable cutting device, or opening the valve respectively. As always when a diaphragm ruptures, a shock wave propagates into the low-pressure region (here the dump tank) and an expansion wave propagates into the high-pressure region (here the nozzle and the long tube). As this unsteady expansion propagates through the long tube, it sets up a steady subsonic flow toward the nozzle, which is accelerated by the convergent-divergent nozzle to a supersonic condition. The flow is steady until the expansion, having been reflected from {{the far end of}} the tube, arrives at the nozzle again. For practical reasons, flow times are about 100 milliseconds for most Ludwieg tubes. For many purposes, this flow duration is sufficient. However, by taking advantage of multiple quasi-static flows between expansion wave reflections, experimentation times of up to 6 seconds can be achieved.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} an exhaust-gas turbine having four separate nozzle boxes each covering a 90 degree arc of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and each connected {{to a pair of}} adjacent cylinders of a nine-cylinder radial engine. This type of turbine has been called a "blowdown" turbine because it recovers the kinetic energy developed in the exhaust stacks during the blowdown period, that is {{the first part of the}} exhaust process when the piston of the reciprocating engine is nearly stationary. The purpose of the {{investigation was}} to determine whether the blow turbine could develop appreciable power without imposing any large loss in engine power arising from restriction of the engine exhaust by the turbine...|$|E
40|$|Efficiency {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} on a single-stage impulse turbine having a 13. 2 -inch pitch-line diameter wheel and a cast <b>nozzle</b> <b>diaphragm</b> over a range of turbine speeds from 3000 to 17, 000 rpm pressure ratios from 1. 5 to 5. 0, inlet total temperatures from 1200 to 2000 degrees R, and inlet total pressures from 18 to 59 inches of mercury absolute. The effect of inlet temperature and pressure on turbine efficiency for constant pressure ratio and blade-to-jet speed ratio is correlated against a factor derived from the equation for Reynolds number. The degree of correlation indicates that the change in turbine efficiency with inlet temperature and pressure for constant pressure ratio and blade-to-jet speed ratio is principally a Reynolds number test.

40|$|The {{suitability}} of cermets for turbine stator blades of a modified turbojet engine was determined {{at an average}} turbine-inlet-gas temperature of 2000 F. Such an increase in temperature would yield a premium in thrust from a service engine. Because the cermet blades require no cooling, all the available compressor bleed air {{could be used to}} cool a turbine made from conventional ductile alloys. Cermet blades were first run in 100 -hour endurance tests at normal gas temperatures in order to evaluate two methods for mounting them. The elevated gas-temperature test was then run using the method of support considered best for high-temperature operation. After 52 hours at 2000 F, one of the group of four cermet blades fractured probably because of end loads resulting from thermal distortion of the spacer band of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> Improved design of a service engine would preclude this cause of premature failure...|$|E
