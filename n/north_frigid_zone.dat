40|$|Fractional {{vegetation}} cover (FVC) {{is an important}} biophysical parameter of terrestrial ecosystems. Variation of FVC {{is a major problem}} in research fields related to remote sensing applications. In this study, the global FVC from 1982 to 2011 was estimated by GIMMS NDVI data, USGS global land cover characteristics data and HWSD soil type data with a modified dimidiate pixel model, which considered vegetation and soil types and mixed pixels decomposition. The evaluation of the robustness and accuracy of the GIMMS FVC with MODIS FVC and Validation of Land European Remote sensing Instruments (VALERI) FVC show high reliability. Trends of the annual FVCmax and FVCmean datasets in the last 30 years were reported by the Mann–Kendall method and Sen’s slope estimator. The results indicated that global FVC change was 0. 20 and 0. 60 in a year with obvious seasonal variability. All of the continents in the world experience a change in the annual FVCmax and FVCmean, which represents biomass production, except for Oceania, which exhibited a significant increase based on a significance level of p = 0. 001 with the Student’s t-test. Global annual maximum and mean FVC growth rates are 0. 14 %/y and 0. 12 %/y, respectively. The trends of the annual FVCmax and FVCmean based on pixels also illustrated that the global vegetation had turned green in the last 30 years. A significant trend on the p = 0. 05 level was found for 15. 36 % of the GIMMS FVCmax pixels on a global scale (excluding permanent snow and ice), in which 1. 8 % exhibited negative trends and 13. 56 % exhibited positive trends. The GIMMS FVCmean similarly produced a total of 16. 64 % significant pixels with 2. 28 % with a negative trend and 14. 36 % with a positive trend. The <b>North</b> <b>Frigid</b> <b>Zone</b> represented the highest annual FVCmax significant increase (p = 0. 05) of 25. 17 %, which may be caused mainly by global warming, Arctic sea-ice loss and an advance in growing seasons. Better FVC predictions at large regional scales, with high temporal resolution (month) and long time series, would advance our ability to understand the characteristics of the global FVC changes in the last 30 years and predict the response of vegetation to global climate change...|$|E

The habits of midges vary greatly from species to species, though within any particular family, midges commonly have similar ecological roles.|$|R

Frost began to render the nights bitterly cold.

50|$|The {{distinction}} between felted and other fibrous materials {{is not always}} sharp. For example, although truly felted hair on healthy mammals is unusual, many animals, especially in seasonally cold or wet climates or environments, often have a so-called undercoat of down hair plus awn hair that usually lies hidden beneath the outer coat of guard hairs, and may form a mat of lightly felted wool. Such down hairs as a rule are crimped into a finely woolly texture and contain waxy, water-repellent lanolin; in a mass they serve to retain insulating air and exclude water. In many species that live in seasonally <b>frigid</b> <b>zones</b> the winter down hair is shed in clumps during springtime. This is exploited in species such as the muskox; herders collect the wool for commercial purposes without any need for shearing.|$|R
2500|$|Pytheas sailed northward {{with the}} intent of {{locating}} the Arctic Circle and exploring the [...] "frigid zone" [...] to the north of it at the extreme of the earth.

Strabo's angular report of this line as being at 24° may well be based on a tangent known to Pytheas, but he does not say that. In whatever mathematical form Pytheas knew the location, he could only have determined when he was there by taking periodic readings of the elevation of the pole (eksarma tou polou in Strabo and others).|$|R
60|$|Water beats {{upon the}} rocks of the sea-shore until it pounds them into sand, or rolls them into pebbles and boulders. It also sweeps the rich soil from the {{mountains}} into the valleys.

In the form of ice it splits asunder the granite hills; and in the northern regions it forms great glaciers, or masses of solidified snow, many miles in extent, and many hundred feet thick. These glaciers descend by slow, imperceptible degrees, to the sea; their edges break off and fall into it, and, floating southward, sometimes in great mountainous masses, are seen by man in the shape of icebergs. Frequently huge rocks, that have fallen upon these glaciers from cliffs in the arctic regions, are carried by them to other regions, and are deposited on flat beaches, far from their native cliffs.|$|R

It marked one more stage of the history of English laws in that immense process of the secularisation of the state, against which, in his book of 1888, Mr. Gladstone had drawn up, with so much weight of reading and thought, a case so wholly unavailing. The legal doctrine of marriage had been established against the theological doctrine by Lord Hardwicke's famous act of 1753, for that measure made the observance of certain requirements then set up by law essential to a good marriage. A further fundamental change had begun with the legislation of civil marriage in 1836.
