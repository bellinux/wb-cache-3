40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} the theoretical {{aspects of the}} <b>nonuniform</b> node <b>distribution</b> strategy used to mitigate the energy hole problem in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). We conclude that in a circular multihop sensor network (modeled as concentric coronas) with <b>nonuniform</b> node <b>distribution</b> and constant data reporting, the unbalanced energy depletion among all the nodes in the network is unavoidable. Even if the nodes in the inner coronas of the network have used up their energy simultaneously, {{the ones in the}} outermost corona may still have unused energy. This is due to the intrinsic many-to-one traffic pattern of WSNs. Nevertheless, nearly balanced energy depletion in the network is possible if the number of nodes increases in geometric progression from the outer coronas to the inner ones except the outermost one. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel <b>nonuniform</b> node <b>distribution</b> strategy to achieve nearly balanced energy depletion in the network. We regulate the number of nodes in each corona and derive the ratio between the node densities in the adjacent ði þ 1 Þth and ith coronas by the strategy. Finally, we propose q-Switch Routing, a distributed shortest path routing algorithm tailored for the proposed <b>nonuniform</b> node <b>distribution</b> strategy. Extensive simulations have been performed to validate the analysis.

The coordination number and coordination geometry of a metal center is determined by the <b>nonuniform</b> <b>distribution</b> of electron density around it, and in general the coordination number increases with cation size.

50|$|The Rayburst Sampling Algorithm {{uses the}} {{original}} grayscale data {{rather than the}} segmented images for precise, continuous radius estimation, and multidirectional radius sampling to more accurately represent non-circular branch cross-sections and non-spherical spine heads. The algorithm precomputes an array of unit vectors which sample the data in multiple directions, (the Sampling Core) from which {{an estimate of the}} node's geometry is computed. Accurate representation of each direction by the sampling core requires that the N vectors should be uniformly spaced over the unit sphere. The algorithm uses a particle physics simulation in which a set N of randomly oriented unit vectors is generated, resulting in a random, <b>nonuniform</b> <b>distribution</b> of points on the sphere. Each particle then receives a repulsive force from every other particle, proportional to the inverse square of the distance between them. By iteratively displacing the particle {{in the direction of the}} resultant forces, the particles rearrange themselves. This system will tend to a stable, minimum energy configuration within approximately 40 iterations, where each particle is maximally separated from its closest neighbors. The information can be used to reconstruct 3D branches of arbitrarily irregular shapes. The diameter of an equivalent circular cross-section is computed in the plane normal to the medial axis using the Median Lower Band Diameter (MLBD). To compute the MLBD, take the set of samples and add the corresponding pairs of opposite vectors. Sort the vectors by size, define the lower band as the lower 50%, and use the distance at position N/4, representing the median of the lower band, to estimate the diameter.|$|E

40|$|Two micromechanical {{models were}} {{developed}} to investigate the thermal expansion of graphite/copper (Gr/Cu) composites. The models incorporate the effects of temperature-dependent material properties, matrix inelasticity, initial residual stresses due to processing history, and <b>nonuniform</b> fiber <b>distribution.</b> The first model {{is based on the}} multiple concentric cylinder geometry, with each cylinder treated as a two-phase composite with a characteristic fiber volume fractions. By altering the fiber volume fraction of the individual cylinders, unidirectional composites with radially <b>nonuniform</b> fiber <b>distributions</b> can be investigated using this model. The second model is based on the inelastic lamination theory. By varying the fiber content in the individual laminae, composites with <b>nonuniform</b> fiber <b>distribution</b> in the thickness direction can be investigated. In both models, the properties of the individual regions (cylinders or laminae) are calculated using the method of cells micromechanical model. Classical incremental plasticity theory is used to model the inelastic response of the copper matrix at the microlevel. The models were used to characterize the effects of <b>nonuniform</b> fiber <b>distribution</b> on the thermal expansion of Gr/Cu. These effects were compared to the effects of matrix plasticity, choice of stress-free temperature, and slight fiber misalignment. It was found that the radially <b>nonuniform</b> fiber <b>distribution</b> has little effect on the thermal expansion of Gr/Cu but could become significant for composites with large fiber-matrix transverse CTE and Young's modulus mismatch. The effect of <b>nonuniform</b> fiber <b>distribution</b> in the through-thickness direction of a laminate was more significant, but only approached that of the stress-free temperature for the most extreme cases that include large amounts of bending. Subsequent comparison with experimental thermal expansion data indicated the need for more accurate characterization of the graphite fiber thermomechanical properties. Correlation with cyclic data revealed the presence of a mechanism not considered in the developed models. The predicted response did, however, exhibit ratcheting behavior that has been observed experimentally in Gr/Cu. Finally, simulation of the actual fiber distribution of particular specimens had little effect on the predicted thermal expansion...|$|R
