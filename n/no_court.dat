5|$|At {{the dawn}} of the 19th century, less than a handful of academically trained architects were active in Norway, most of them {{military}} officers having studied civil engineering. The market for architects was limited in a sparsely inhabited country with no capital city, <b>no</b> <b>court</b> and no important government institutions. Architecture was of interest mainly to a limited group of wealthy merchants and landowners. However, toward the close of the previous century, this group saw a remarkable increase in prosperity. Large fortunes were made by a few, who then sought to surround themselves with buildings and gardens appropriate to their social position. Well connected internationally, these people were acquainted with the latest trends in architecture. Neoclassical structures were much in demand.|$|E

5|$|He was unfortunate {{again on}} 22 April 1943 when, {{in command of}} Camilla on an RAAF {{contract}} involving the transport of military personnel to Port Moresby, he found himself unable to proceed due to bad weather, {{and was forced to}} attempt a night landing on the open ocean when off the coast of New Guinea. Due largely to the inexperience of his co-pilot, the aircraft broke up on landing, and 13 out of the 31 people on board did not survive. Koch spent about 18 hours in the sea before being rescued at the chance passage of a local steamer. A. B. Corbett, the Director-General of Civil Aviation, recommended to his Minister that in view of the circumstances <b>no</b> <b>Court</b> of Inquiry be held—in effect Koch was exonerated.|$|E
5|$|The first {{accusation}} against Sherwood came {{to court}} in early 1697. Richard Capps alleged {{that she had}} used a spell to cause {{the death of his}} bull. The court made no decision, and the Sherwoods filed a defamation suit against Capps that was resolved by a settlement. In 1698, Sherwood was accused by her neighbor John Gisburne of enchanting his pigs and cotton crop. <b>No</b> <b>court</b> action followed this accusation, and another suit for defamation by the Sherwoods failed. In the same year Elizabeth Barnes alleged that Sherwood had assumed the form of a black cat, entered Barnes' home, jumped over her bed, drove and whipped her, and left via the keyhole. Again the allegation was unresolved, and again the subsequent defamation action was lost. For each of the failed actions, Sherwood and her husband had to pay court-related costs.|$|E
5|$|The {{reference}} {{must state}} {{the questions on}} which the Tribunal's opinion is required in a form which allows, as far as possible, answers to be given in the affirmative or the negative. There must also be a concise statement of facts, and documents must be included, as are necessary to enable the Tribunal to decide the questions referred. During the hearing of a reference, the procedure in proceedings before the Court of Appeal applies. The President of Singapore is treated as the appellant and all other parties as respondents. However, the Tribunal is not bound by strict rules of evidence. The proceedings of the Tribunal, except for the hearing for directions, are held in open court. No party to any proceedings is ordered to pay any costs, and <b>no</b> <b>court</b> fees are payable in respect of any proceedings.|$|E

25|$|Although anti-miscegenation {{amendments}} were {{proposed in}} United States Congress in 1871, 1912–1913 and 1928, a nationwide law against racially mixed marriages was never enacted.

25|$|Lines of {{authority}} were also blurred as GHQ Air Force controlled only combat flying units within the continental United States.

Base commanders of Air Corps installations reported to as many as four different higher echelons. The issue of control of bases was ameliorated in 1936 when GHQAF bases were exempted from corps area authority on recommendation of the Inspector General's Department, but in November 1940 it was restored again to Corps Area control when Army General Headquarters was activated.|$|E
