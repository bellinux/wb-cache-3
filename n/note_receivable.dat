40|$|An {{enterprise}} {{receives a}} note, rather than cash, as {{a contribution to}} its equity. The transaction may be a sale of capital stock or a contribution to paid-in capital. The issue is whether an enterprise should report the <b>note</b> <b>receivable</b> as a reduction of shareholders' equity or as an asset. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that reporting the note as an asset is generally not appropriate, except in very limited circumstances when there is substantial evidence of ability and intent to pay within a reasonably short period of time. Some Task Force members would require collateralization, or payment of the note prior to issuance of the financial statements, to permit asset recognition. The SEC requires that public companies report notes received in payment for the enterprise's stock as a deduction from shareholders ' equity. Task Force members confirmed that the predominant practice is to offset the notes and stock in the equity section. However, such notes may be recorded as an asset if collected in cash prior to issuance of the financial statements. Some Task Force members stated that {{they were aware of}} very few cases in which nonpublic companies reported such notes as an asset except in circumstances in which they (1) were secured Copyright © 1985, Financial Accounting Standards Board Not for redistribution age 1 by irrevocable letters of credit or other liquid collateral or were discountable at a bank and (2) included a stated maturity in a reasonably short period of time.

Capital assets generally include those assets outside the daily scope of business operations, such as investment or personal assets. The United States system defines a capital asset by exclusion. [...] Capital assets include all assets except inventory of supplies or property held for sale (including subdivided real estate), depreciable property used in a business, accounts or <b>notes</b> <b>receivable,</b> certain commodities derivatives and hedging items, and certain copyrights and similar property held by the creator of the property.

All taxable dividends and interest which exceed the $1,250 single exemption or the $2,500 joint exemption are taxable at the rate of 6%. The state's sales and use tax rate for most items is 7%.

Local sales taxes are collected in most jurisdictions, at rates varying from 1.5% to 2.75%, bringing the total sales tax to between 8.5% and 9.75%, one of the highest levels in the nation.

During the existing war it is peculiarly {{the duty of}} the National Government to secure to the people a sound circulating medium. This duty has been, under existing circumstances, satisfactorily performed, in part at least, by authorizing the issue of United States <b>notes,</b> <b>receivable</b> for all government dues except customs, and made a legal tender for all debts, public and private, except interest on public debt. The object of the bill submitted to me--namely, that of providing a small note currency during the present suspension--can be fully accomplished by authorizing the issue, as part of any new emission of United States notes made necessary by the circumstances of the country, of notes of a similar character, but of less denomination than five dollars.

In July and August, 1861, and February, 1862, the issue of sixty millions of dollars in United States notes, payable on demand, was authorized. They were made receivable in payments, but were not declared a legal tender until March, 1862, when the amount in circulation had been greatly reduced by receipt and cancellation. In 1862 and 1863 the issue of four hundred and fifty millions in United States notes, payable not on demand, but, in effect, at the convenience of the government, was authorized, subject to certain restrictions as to fifty millions. These <b>notes</b> were made <b>receivable</b> for the bonds of the National loans, for all debts due to or from the United States, except duties on imports and interest on the public debt, and were also declared a legal tender. In March, 1863, the issue of notes for parts of a dollar was authorized to an amount not exceeding fifty millions of dollars. These notes were not declared a legal tender, but were [...] made redeemable under regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. In February, 1863, the issue of three hundred millions of dollars in notes of the National banking associations was authorized. These <b>notes</b> were made <b>receivable</b> to the same extent as United States notes, and provision was made to secure their redemption, but they were not made a legal tender.|$|R

Only about $6 million of the loan was placed in the form of 6% interest bonds, and thus $5 million of Notes were issued. The <b>Notes</b> were made <b>receivable</b> for all public dues owed the federal government and payable to the order of the owner by endorsement.

In April 1859, Hungerford wanted to show the community that he was successful on his own so he bought a beautiful home lacking ostentation on 54 West First Street in Corning, New York. [...] In November 1868, Hungerford began purchasing three-month promissory <b>notes</b> pledged against <b>receivables</b> from the Corning Flint Glass Works; this liquidity helped the struggling glass producer meet payroll, purchase raw materials, and refinance other notes that became due.

5000|$|Legal tender status {{guaranteed}} that creditors {{would have to}} accept the notes {{despite the fact that they}} were not backed by gold, bank deposits, or government reserves, and had no interest. However, the First Legal Tender Act did not make the notes an unlimited legal tender as they could not be used by merchants to pay customs duties on imports and could not be used by the government to pay interest on its bonds. The Act did provide that the <b>notes</b> be <b>receivable</b> by the government for short term deposits at 5% interest, and for the purchase of 6% interest 20-year bonds at par. The rationale for these terms was that the Union government would preserve its credit-worthiness by supporting the value of its bonds by paying their interest in gold. Early in the war, customs duties were a large part of government tax revenue and by making these payable in gold, the government would generate the coin necessary to make the interest payments on the bonds. Lastly, by making the bonds available for purchase at par in United States Notes, the value of the latter would be confirmed as well. The limitations of the legal tender status were quite controversial. Thaddeus Stevens, the Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee of Ways and Means, which had authored an earlier version of the Legal Tender Act that would have made United States Notes a legal tender for all debts, denounced the exceptions, calling the new bill [...] "mischievous" [...] because it made United States Notes an intentionally depreciated currency for the masses, while the banks who loaned to the government got [...] "sound money" [...] in gold. This controversy would continue until the removal of the exceptions during 1933.|$|R
