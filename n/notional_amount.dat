25|$|The {{derivatives}} team at JPMorgan (including Blythe Masters) was {{a pioneer}} in the invention of credit derivatives such as the credit default swap. The first CDS was created to allow Exxon to borrow money from JPMorgan while JPMorgan transferred the risk to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. JPMorgan's team later created the 'BISTRO', a bundle of credit default swaps that was the progenitor of the Synthetic CDO. JPMorgan currently has the largest credit default swap and credit derivatives portfolio by total <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> of any US bank.|$|E
500|$|Enron {{transferred}} to [...] "Raptor I-IV", four LJM-related special purpose entities {{named after the}} velociraptors in Jurassic Park, more than [...] "$1.2 billion in assets, including millions of shares of Enron common stock and long term rights to purchase millions more shares, plus $150 million of Enron notes payable" [...] as disclosed in the company's financial statement footnotes. The special purpose entities {{had been used to}} pay for all of this using the entities' debt instruments. The footnotes also declared that the instruments' face amount totaled $1.5 billion, and the entities <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> of $2.1 billion had been used to enter into derivative contracts with Enron.|$|E
2500|$|The {{market size}} for Credit Default Swaps {{more than doubled}} in size each year from $3.7trillion in 2003. [...] By the end of 2007, the CDS market had a {{notional}} value of $62.2trillion. But <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> fell during 2008 as a result of dealer [...] "portfolio compression" [...] efforts (replacing offsetting redundant contracts), {{and by the end of}} 2008 <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> outstanding had fallen 38 percent to $38.6trillion.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Notional</b> <b>amounts</b> {{outstanding}} as of December 2012 are $632 trillion as per recent survey. (http://www.bis.org/statistics/dt1920a.pdf) ...|$|R
50|$|In {{simple terms}} the <b>notional</b> {{principal}} <b>amount</b> is essentially {{how much of}} the asset or bonds a person has. For example, if a premium bond was bought for £1 then the <b>notional</b> principal <b>amount</b> would be the face value amount of premium bond that your £1 was able to purchase. Hence the <b>notional</b> principal <b>amount</b> is the quantity of the assets and bonds.|$|R
50|$|For example, a GBPUSD {{contract}} {{could give}} the owner the right to sell £1,000,000 and buy $2,000,000 on December 31. In this case the pre-agreed exchange rate, or strike price, is 2.0000 USD per GBP (or GBP/USD 2.00 as it is typically quoted) and the <b>notional</b> <b>amounts</b> (<b>notionals)</b> are £1,000,000 and $2,000,000.|$|R
2500|$|Since default is a {{relatively}} rare occurrence (historically around 0.2% of investment grade companies default in any one year), in most CDS contracts the only payments are the premium payments from buyer to seller. [...] Thus, although the above figures for outstanding notionals are very large, {{in the absence of}} default the net cash flows are {{only a small fraction of}} this total: for a 100 bp = 1% spread, the annual cash flows are only 1% of the <b>notional</b> <b>amount.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Pension fund example: [...] A {{pension fund}} owns five-year bonds issued by Risky Corp with par value of $10million. To manage {{the risk of}} losing money if Risky Corp {{defaults}} on its debt, the pension fund buys a CDS from Derivative Bank in a <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> of $10million. [...] The CDS trades at 200 basis points (200 basis points = 2.00 percent). [...] In return for this credit protection, the pension fund pays 2% of $10million ($200,000) per annum in quarterly installments of $50,000 to Derivative Bank.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "spread" [...] of a CDS is {{the annual}} amount the {{protection}} buyer must pay the protection seller over {{the length of}} the contract, expressed {{as a percentage of the}} <b>notional</b> <b>amount.</b> For example, if the CDS spread of Risky Corp is 50 basis points, or 0.5% (1 basis point = 0.01%), then an investor buying $10million worth of protection from AAA-Bank must pay the bank $50,000. [...] Payments are usually made on a quarterly basis, in arrears. [...] These payments continue until either the CDS contract expires or Risky Corp defaults.|$|E
5000|$|... {{notional}} amount: This is the [...] "face value" [...] of the NDF, {{which is}} agreed {{between the two}} counterparties. It should again be noted that there is never any intention to exchange the <b>notional</b> <b>amounts</b> in the two currencies ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the context}} of an {{interest}} rate swap, the <b>notional</b> principal <b>amount</b> is the specified amount on which the exchanged interest payments are based; this could be 8000 US dollars, or 2.7 million pounds sterling, or any other combination of a number and a currency. Each period's rates are multiplied by the <b>notional</b> principal <b>amount</b> to determine the height and currency of each counter-party's payment. A <b>notional</b> principal <b>amount</b> is the amount used as a reference to calculate the amount of interest due on an 'interest only class' which is not entitled to any principal.|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} {{comprehensive}} {{analysis of the}} determinants of trading in the sovereign credit default swaps (CDS) market, using weekly data for single-name sovereign CDS from October 2008 to September 2015. We describe the anatomy of the sovereign CDS market, derive a law of motion for gross positions and their components, and identify the key factors that drive the cross-sectional and time-series properties of trading volume and net <b>notional</b> <b>amounts</b> outstanding. While a single principal component accounts for 54 percent {{of the variation in}} sovereign CDS spreads, the largest common factor explains only 7 percent of the variation in sovereign CDS net <b>notional</b> <b>amounts</b> outstanding. Moreover, unlike for CDS spreads, common global factors explain very little of the variation in sovereign CDS trading and net <b>notional</b> <b>amounts</b> outstanding, suggesting that it is driven primarily by idiosyncratic country risk. We analyze several local and regional channels that may explain the trading in sovereign CDS: (a) country-specific credit risk shocks, including changes in a country's credit rating and related outlook changes, (b) the announcement and issuance of domestic and international debt, (c) macroeconomic sentiment derived from conventional and unconventional monetary policy, macro-economic news and shocks, and (d) regulatory channels, such as changes in bank capital adequacy requirements. All our findings suggest that sovereign CDS are more likely used for hedging than for speculative purposes...|$|R
5000|$|... the vega notional: Like other swaps, {{the payoff}} is {{determined}} based on a <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> that is never exchanged. However, {{in the case of}} a variance swap, the <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> is specified in terms of vega, to convert the payoff into dollar terms.|$|E
50|$|In {{a typical}} total return swap, one party pays a fixed or {{floating}} rate multiplied by a notional principal amount plus the depreciation, if any, in a <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> of property {{in exchange for}} payments by the other party of the appreciation, if any, on the same <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> of property. For example, assume the underlying property is the S&P 500 stock index. A would pay B LIBOR times a $100 <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> plus depreciation, if any, on a $100 notional investment in the S&P 500 index. B would pay A the appreciation, if any, in the same notional S&P 500 investment.|$|E

5000|$|Positions in the OTC {{derivatives}} market {{have increased}} {{at a rapid}} pace since the last triennial survey was undertaken in 2004. <b>Notional</b> <b>amounts</b> outstanding of such instruments totalled $516 trillion {{at the end of}} June 2007, 135% higher than the level recorded in the 2004 survey (Graph 4). This corresponds to an annualised compound rate of growth of 33%, which is higher than the approximatively 25% average annual rate of increase since positions in OTC derivatives were first surveyed by the BIS in 1995. <b>Notional</b> <b>amounts</b> outstanding provide useful information on the structure of the OTC derivatives market but should not be interpreted as a measure of the riskiness of these positions.

5000|$|The term {{notional}} principal contract (NPC) {{is a term}} of art used by U.S. {{federal income}} tax professionals for contracts based on an underlying <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> (other financial services professionals refer to such NPCs under the more general heading [...] "swaps," [...] although not all swaps are NPCs). The reason the underlying amount is [...] "notional" [...] is because neither party to the NPC is required to actually hold the property comprising the underlying amount. NPCs involve two parties who agree contractually to pay each other amounts at specified times, based on the underlying <b>notional</b> <b>amount.</b> The simplest example of an NPC is a so-called interest rate swap, in which one party (Party A) pays the other party (Party B) an amount each quarter determined by multiplying a floating, market-determined interest rate (e.g., LIBOR) by the notional amount; and Party B pays Party A on the same date an amount determined by multiplying a fixed interest rate by the <b>notional</b> <b>amount.</b>|$|E
