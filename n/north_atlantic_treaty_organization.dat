40|$|There is a {{critical}} shortfall in special operations aviation support for the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>Organizations</b> (NATO) special operations forces (SOF). One way this shortfall can be addressed is through the procurement and sustainment of the NATO SOF Air Wing (NSAW) under NATO Special Operations Headquarters (NSHQ). NSHQ coordinates, trains, and employs NATOs special operation forces. With the addition of organic SOF aviation forces, NATOs ground forces capabilities and mission success will be enhanced. This thesis focuses on the basing recommendations for the NATO SOF Air Wing. The basing location for the NATO SOF Air Wing has centered on proximity to NATO SOF HQ in Mons, Belgium and minimized other important considerations, such as runway requirements, tarmac space, supporting infrastructure, weather, and proximity to training. A location decision is a complex endeavor; one that has long-term impact and therefore requires systematic analysis to find an effective and efficient solution. This thesis follows previous military efforts utilizing business sector applications to improve the decision making. Specifically, it applies the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to the NATO SOF Air Wing basing decision to provide an effective and efficient recommendation. Captain, United States Air Forc...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThere {{is a critical}} shortfall in dedicated special operations aviation support for the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>Organizations</b> (NATO) special operations forces (SOF). One way this shortfall can be addressed is through the procurement and sustainment of an organic NATO SOF Air Wing. In 2006, NATOs Heads of State and Governments endorsed the NATO Special Operations Forces Transformation Initiative, creating what would eventually become the NATO Special Operations Headquarters (NSHQ). NSHQ coordinates, trains, and employs NATOs special operations forces. These forces have proven invaluable in fighting asymmetric threats due to their light, lean, and agile construct, and their versatile projection of high-impact tactics, techniques, and procedures that create strategic effects. The research in this study examines NSHQs requirement for an organic Air Wing and proposes the optimal mix of aviation platforms to support NATO SOF. This optimal mix contains rotary-wing and fixed-wing aviation platforms, as well as intelligence, surveillance, targeting, and reconnaissance aircraft. This research also examines NSHQs training and readiness organizational structure, and proposes changes based {{on the development of}} an organic Air Wing. Dedicated special operations aviation support to NATO special operations forces will greatly enhance the capabilities and mission success of NATO SOF in addressing emerging security challenges.

5|$|In September 1975, the 24th Infantry Division was {{reactivated}} at Fort Stewart, Georgia, {{as part of}} {{the program}} to build a 16-division US Army force. Because the Regular Army could not field a full division at Fort Stewart, the 24th had the 48th Infantry Brigade of the Georgia Army National Guard assigned to it as a round-out unit in place of its 3rd Brigade. Targeted for a <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>Organization</b> (NATO) role, the 24th Division was reorganized as a mechanized division in 1979. It was one of several divisions equipped with new M1 Abrams tanks and M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles that formed the core of the U.S. Army's heavily armored mechanized force for the 15 years that followed.|$|E

In mid-August, the Greek government withdrew Greece from the NATO military structure; in mid-September 1974, the Senate and House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to Turkey. Ford, concerned with both {{the effect of this}} on Turkish-American relations and the deterioration of security on NATO's eastern front, vetoed the bill.

5|$|Interest in Banak {{rose with}} the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948 {{and fears of}} Soviet {{intervention}} in Norway.

However, Norway's entry into the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>Organization</b> (NATO) in 1949 had a dramatic effect on the military strategy and Banak. Finnmark {{was regarded as a}} tripwire and was to be sacrificed in case of a Soviet invasion. The airfield was closed in 1952, but the runway remained, consisting of a short section of unmaintained wooden runway and the rest a grass strip. It was occasionally used by small aircraft.|$|E
