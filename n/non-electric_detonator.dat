40|$|In recent years, the {{interest}} in electronic detonators has increased due to its reported ability to define sequences that can significantly improve blasting results and lower environmental impact {{in relation to the}} mining and quarrying industry. However, few actual scientific studies have been carried out and published. This thesis investigates the use of electronic detonator with the aim of controlling and minimising the environmental impact of blasting. Its use was examined by comparing their performance to current <b>non-electric</b> <b>detonators</b> by performing a series of full scale like-for-like experiments under strict operational procedures in a variety of rock hosts. In addition, two single hole multi deck blasts were carried out to assess the influence of both distance and individual location response. The results obtained indicate that {{it is not possible to}} select one electronic detonator timing interval that will give rise to the absolute lowest Peak Particle Velocity for all observation points. However, it showed that it is possible to choose the 'least worst' option for all or just a number of specific monitoring locations. From this it has been possible to establish a methodology that could be used to reduce the peak particle velocities at multiple locations by using single hole blast vibration signatures in conjunction with specific electronic detonator timing intervals. The study has concluded that this would only be possible if, as the blasting pattern encroaches on specific properties, that periodically single hole signature blasts were carried out to establish the shape ofthe relevant actual vibration envelopes. These wave envelopes could be used as the basis for choosing the specific electronic detonator timing intervals to give the lowest common peak particle velocity for the properties concerned thus controlling the environmental impact of blasting.

40|$|The {{drill and}} blast {{excavation}} method {{is the most}} commonly used method for tunnel construction in Norway. In D&B the results from blasting can be evaluated through several factors, such as pull percentage, vibration level and contour quality. The main goal of the thesis was to analyze excavation with a special focus {{on the quality of the}} achieved contour and the influence of the applied initiation system. The analysis was performed based on results from the Bjørnegård tunnel, which was a part of the E 16 Sandvika-Wøyen, Norwegian infrastructural project. Tunnel excavation analysis was done by an estimation of the drilling accuracy and measurement results from scanning. Data for the thesis was collected from one tunnel tube from twelve rounds in total: seven of which used standard <b>non-electric</b> <b>detonators</b> and five used electronic detonators. The assumption was that the use of the electronic detonators as an initiation system has the potential for better contour quality. Special accuracy of the drilling was required for the test. The analysis was divided into two parts. The first part was focused on the analysis of drilling accuracy. For the evaluation of the results, MWD data from the drilling jumbo was used. Local coordinates from the drilling rig were used for the estimation of the spacing and length of the drilling holes, while global coordinates were used for the start and end position of the holes in comparison to the theoretical contour. The second part focused on the analysis of the results from the tunnel scanning, which provided information about theoretical and actual contour length, theoretical and overblast area and distances from the theoretical to the actually blasted contour. Scanning analysis was based on an evaluation of the ratio of actual contour length to planned contour length (RCL), ratio of actual blasted to planned area(RBA), overbreak and Tunnel Contour Quality Index (TCI). Analysis of the drilling results showed no significant difference between the accuracy of the drilling in the non-electric rounds compared to the test rounds. Estimation of the spacing and length of the contour holes presented a difference of 1 % and 3 % respectively. Results of the calculation of the starting position of the holes indicated a decrease of the accuracy of the placement of the hole in accordance to the theoretical profile. The special requirement of a maximum 10 cm distance from the theoretical contour of the starting position of the holes was fulfilled for 13 % of the holes drilled in the test rounds. Evaluation of the scanning results showed that results from <b>non-electric</b> and electronic <b>detonators</b> rounds were similar, and no improvement of the tunnel quality was calculated. Tunnel Contour Quality Index (TCI) for both data sets was similar and estimated as average...|$|R
