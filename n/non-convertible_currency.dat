5000|$|Rodríguez Saá's {{economic}} team {{came up with}} a scheme designed to preserve the convertibility regime, dubbed the [...] "Third Currency" [...] Plan. It consisted of creating a new, <b>non-convertible</b> <b>currency,</b> the Argentino that would coexist with convertible pesos and US dollars. It would circulate as cash, or but not in checks, promissory notes, or other instruments, which could be denominated in pesos or dollars. It would be partially guaranteed with federally-managed land to counterbalance inflationary tendencies.|$|E
50|$|As {{the early}} 20th century gold {{standard}} was undermined by inflation {{and the late}} 20th century fiat dollar hegemony evolved, and as banks proliferated and engaged in more complex transactions {{and were able to}} profit from dealings globally on a moment's notice, these practices became mandatory, if only to ensure that there was some limit on the ballooning of money supply. Such limits have become harder to enforce. The People's Bank of China retains (and uses) more powers over reserves because the yuan that it manages is a <b>non-convertible</b> <b>currency.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Between 1979 and 1989 the {{government}} of the German Democratic Republic provided health assistance to Sandinista Nicaragua. After initial relief aid, the Sandinista embrace of a primary health care-based health system made East German health support difficult. The <b>non-convertible</b> <b>currency,</b> the repressive quality of the East German leadership, and the lack of experience with primary health care processes all limited its potential to provide support. After 1985, when implementation of this system stalled, East German health assistance was revitalized with the donation of the Hospital Carlos Marx. Providing medical services to three hundred thousand people, it combined elements of a strictly East German institution, using German personnel and equipment, with some integration into local systems...|$|E
50|$|Below is a (non-exhaustive) list of {{currencies}} where non-deliverable forwards are traded.Not all <b>non-convertible</b> <b>currencies</b> have a NDF market (e.g. BDT had no active {{market as}} of 2011). A currency may be convertible by some market participants while being non-convertible to others.|$|R
50|$|To {{influence}} the money supply, some central banks may require that {{some or all}} foreign exchange receipts (generally from exports) be exchanged for the local currency. The rate {{that is used to}} purchase local currency may be market-based or arbitrarily set by the bank. This tool is generally used in countries with <b>non-convertible</b> <b>currencies</b> or partially convertible currencies. The recipient of the local currency may be allowed to freely dispose of the funds, required to hold the funds with the central bank for some period of time, or allowed to use the funds subject to certain restrictions. In other cases, the ability to hold or use the foreign exchange may be otherwise limited.|$|R
50|$|The peso moneda corriente was a <b>non-convertible</b> Argentine paper <b>currency</b> which {{circulated}} between 9 January 1826, and 4 November 1881. Its symbol was $m/c. It {{was also}} known as the peso papel (paper money).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a multilateral currency system where national currencies {{are used for}} trade settlement in East Asia, comprising the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member countries, the People's Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+ 3). The currency scheme is expected to mitigate {{the risks associated with}} independent attempts at internationalization in <b>non-convertible</b> <b>currency</b> countries. It could also reduce dependence on the US dollar, safeguard against financial spillovers from outside, and deepen trade and financial integration in the region. The patterns and structure of trade and financial openness suggest that East Asia has already established an economic base upon which it could launch such a system. The experience with renminbi internationalization will help the Republic of Korea and ASEAN- 5 to emulate this strategy...|$|E
50|$|There can be {{a number}} of causes of high inflation. However, most hyperinflations have been caused by {{government}} budget deficits financed by money creation. Peter Bernholz analysed 29 hyperinflations (following Cagan's definition) and concludes that at least 25 of them have been caused in this way. A necessary condition for hyperinflation is the use of paper money, instead of gold or silver coins. Most hyperinflations in history, with some exceptions, such as the French hyperinflation of 1789-1796, occurred after the use of fiat currency became widespread in the late 19th century. The French hyperinflation took place after the introduction of a <b>non-convertible</b> paper <b>currency,</b> the assignats.|$|R
