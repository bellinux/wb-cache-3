Financial constraints had prevented her parents from attending the wedding, and in their stead, they sent her brother, Crown Prince Frederick. Her brother-in-law, the Prince of Wales, had also travelled to Saint Petersburg for the ceremony; pregnancy had prevented the Princess of Wales from attending. After the wedding night, Alexander wrote in his diary, [...] "I took off my slippers and my silver embroidered robe and felt the body of my beloved <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>mine...</b> How I felt then, I {{do not wish to}} describe here. Afterwards we talked for a long time."

50|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the minting house cooperatives {{vanished}} when minting {{was taken over}} by sovereigns or cities. The Münzmeister was now an entrepreneur who determined weight, precious-metal content, seignorage and their own share, by way of free negotiations with the principals. <b>Next</b> <b>to</b> <b>mines</b> and shipyards, mints had become the largest enterprises of the age.|$|R

Fairfax was more heavily mined before the miners moved onto North West Island.|$|R

A night out might do him good." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{township}} of Eastlake {{was established}} <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the <b>mine.</b> The mining superintendent, Ferdinand Fiedler listed his address at Eastlake as did assistant superintendent, J.E.

The mine’s owner-investors all lived in San Francisco. Eastlake was directly adjacent <b>to</b> the <b>mining</b> property. After the mine closed, Eastlake was abandoned.|$|R
50|$|Attempts {{to extract}} silver from sulfidic waste {{commenced}} in 1960 but success only occurred after 1980.

50|$|In 1957 the Exotica deposit (South Mine) was {{discovered}} beneath tailings, {{which turned out}} to be the largest known deposit of exotic copper. This led Anaconda to build an oxide plant, concentrator, smelter, refinery, and town, all <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the <b>mine,</b> plus a power plant in Tocopilla. However, in 1971, the mine was nationalized and operations were then assumed by CODELCO.|$|R

50|$|South Africa's mining {{industry}} {{is the largest}} single producer of solid waste, accounting for {{about two-thirds of the}} total waste stream. Tens of thousands of deaths have occurred among mine workers as a result of accidents over the last century. There have been several deaths and debilitating diseases from work-related illnesses like asbestosis. For those who live <b>next</b> <b>to</b> a <b>mine,</b> the quality of air and water is poor. Noise, dust, and dangerous equipment and vehicles can be threats to the safety of those who live <b>next</b> <b>to</b> a <b>mine</b> as well. These communities are often poor and black and have little choice over the placement of a mine near their homes. The National Party introduced a new Minerals Act that began to address environmental considerations by recognizing the health and safety concerns of workers and the need for land rehabilitation during and after mining operations. In 1993, the Act was amended to require each new <b>mine</b> <b>to</b> have an Environmental Management Program Report (EMPR) prepared before breaking ground. These EMPRs were intended <b>to</b> force <b>mining</b> companies <b>to</b> outline all the possible environmental impacts of the particular <b>mining</b> operation and <b>to</b> make provision for environmental management.|$|R
