40|$|Echo cancelers which cover longer impulse {{responses}} (64 ms) are desirable. Long responses {{create a}} need for more rapidly con-verging algorithms {{in order to meet the}} specifications for <b>network</b> <b>echo</b> cancelers devised by ITU (International Telecommunication Union). In general, faster convergence implies a higher sensitiv-ity to near-end disturbances, especially ”double-talk. ” Recently, a fast converging algorithm called Proportionate NLMS (Normal-ized Least Mean Squares) algorithm (PNLMS) has been proposed. This algorithm exploits the sparseness of the echo path. In this pa-per we propose a method for making the PNLMS algorithm more robust against double-talk. The slower divergence rate of these robust algorithms in combination with a standard Geigel double-talk detector improves the performance of a <b>network</b> <b>echo</b> canceler considerably during double-talk. This results in the robust PNLMS algorithm which diverges much slower than PNLMS and standard NLMS. A generalization of the robust PNLMS algorithm to a ro-bust proportionate Affine Projection Algorithm (APA) is also pre-sented. It converges very fast, and unlike PNLMS, is not as de-pendent on the assumption of a sparse echo path response. Trade off between convergence and divergence rate is easily tuned with one parameter and the added complexity is about 7 instructions per sample. 1...|$|E

40|$|<b>Network</b> <b>echo</b> {{canceler}} {{chips are}} designed to handle several channels simultaneously. With the processing speeds now available, a single chip might handle several hundred channels. In current implementations, however, the adaptation algorithm is designed for a single channel, and the computations are replicated N c times, where Nc {{is the number of}} channels. With such an implementation, the computational requirement is N c times the peak load for a single channel. The number of computations required in each channel, however, varies widely over time. Therefore, a considerable reduction in computational load can be achieved by designing the system for the average load plus a margin to account for load variations. The reduction in complexity is achieved by exploiting three features: (a) the inherent pauses in conversations, (b) the sparseness of <b>network</b> <b>echo</b> paths, and (c) the fact that an adaptive filter {{does not need to be}} updated when the error signal is small.

40|$|Abstract—This work {{proposes a}} general Reservoir Computing (RC) {{learning}} framework {{which can be}} used to learn navigation behaviors for mobile robots in simple and complex unknown, partially observable environments. RC provides an efficient way to train recurrent neural networks by letting the recurrent part of the network (called reservoir) fixed while only a linear readout output layer is trained. The proposed RC framework builds upon the notion of navigation attractor or behavior which can be embedded in the high-dimensional space of the reservoir after learning. The learning of multiple behaviors is possible because the dynamic robot behavior, consisting of a sensory-motor sequence, can be linearly discriminated in the high-dimensional nonlinear space of the dynamic reservoir. Three learning approaches for navigation behaviors are shown in this paper. The first approach learns multiple behaviors based on examples of navigation behaviors generated by a supervisor, while the second approach learns goal-directed navigation behaviors based only on rewards. The third approach learns complex goal-directed behaviors, in a supervised way, using an hierarchical architecture whose internal predictions of contextual switches guide the sequence of basic navigation behaviors towards the goal.

30|$|Since {{the first}} {{adaptive}} linear <b>echo</b> canceler for <b>network</b> <b>echoes</b> in telephone lines [1], linear echo cancellation has evolved to a key ingredient {{of almost any}} full-duplex speech communication system. This {{has resulted in a}} multitude of approaches to efficiently model, parametrize, and estimate even complex linear systems, such as the acoustic echo paths in hands-free wideband telecommunication scenarios [2]. With increasingly common nonlinear distortions produced by miniaturized amplifiers and loudspeakers in modern portable devices, dedicated nonlinear echo path models have emerged as an important topic of research and motivated sophisticated approaches for nonlinear Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC) based on Volterra filters [3 – 5], artificial neural networks [6, 7], Functional Link Adaptive Filters (FLAFs) [8, 9], or kernel methods [10, 11]. A very simple, yet effective model for nonlinear acoustic echo paths is the cascade of a memoryless preprocessor (modeling loudspeaker signal distortions) and a subsequent linear system (modeling sound propagation through air) [12]. Due to its simplicity, this so-called Hammerstein Model (HM) has been frequently employed [13 – 22] and will also be used in this contribution. So will be a group of B parallel HMs, referred to as Hammerstein Group Model (HGM) in the following.
