40|$|Abstract—The minimum {{variance}} distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer, {{also known as}} Capon’s beamformer, is widely studied {{in the area of}} speech enhancement. The MVDR beamformer can be used for both speech dereverberation and noise reduction. This paper provides new insights into the MVDR beamformer. Specifically, the local and global behavior of the MVDR beamformer is analyzed and novel forms of the MVDR filter are derived and discussed. In earlier works it was observed that there is a tradeoff between the amount of speech derever-beration and noise reduction when the MVDR beamformer is used. Here, the tradeoff between speech dereverberation and noise reduction is analyzed thoroughly. The local and global behavior, as well as the tradeoff, is analyzed for different <b>noise</b> <b>fields</b> such as, for example, a mixture of coherent and non-coherent <b>noise</b> <b>fields,</b> entirely non-coherent <b>noise</b> <b>fields</b> and diffuse <b>noise</b> <b>fields.</b> It is shown that maximum noise reduction is achieved when the MVDR beamformer is used for noise reduction only. The amount of noise reduction that is sacrificed when complete dereverber-ation is required depends on the direct-to-reverberation ratio of the acoustic impulse response between the source and the reference microphone. The performance evaluation supports the theoretical analysis and demonstrates the tradeoff between speech dereverberation and noise reduction. When desiring both speech dereverberation and noise reduction, the results also demonstrate that the amount of noise reduction that is sacrificed decreases when the number of microphones increases.

The concept of the proposed development is based on the time interval over which the temporal coherence or correlation properties of a <b>noise</b> <b>field</b> are defined. For narrow-band signals, the associated temporal coherence period is much longer than the correlation time interval of the anisotropic <b>noise</b> <b>field.</b> Thus, a coherent integration of discontinuous segments of received signals will enhance the SNR at the single sensor by lowering the correlation properties of the associated non-white noise. Reconstruction of the narrow-band signal time series with improved SNR at the sensor will allow the use of the existing high-resolution techniques to be utilized more effectively by lowering their threshold values in order to detect very weak signals.
