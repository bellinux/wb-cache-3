2500|$|The {{incentive}} to use 100% renewable energy {{has been created}} by global warming and other ecological {{as well as economic}} concerns. Mark Z. Jacobson says producing all new energy with wind power, solar power, [...] and hydropower by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be [...] "primarily social and political, not technological or economic". Jacobson says that energy costs with a wind, solar, water system should be similar to today's energy costs. According to a 2011 projection by the (IEA)International Energy Agency, solar power generators may produce most of the world's electricity within 50 years, dramatically reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions. Critics of the [...] "100% renewable energy" [...] approach include Vaclav Smil and James E. Hansen. Smil and Hansen are concerned about the variable output of solar and wind power, <b>NIMBYism,</b> and a lack of infrastructure.|$|E

50|$|NIMBY and its {{derivative}} terms <b>NIMBYism,</b> NIMBYs, and NIMBYists, refer implicitly to {{debates of}} development generally or {{to a specific}} case. As such, their use is inherently contentious. The term is usually applied to opponents of a development, implying that they have narrow, selfish, or myopic views. Its use is often pejorative.|$|E
50|$|Statutory {{planning}} {{otherwise known}} as town planning, development control or development management, refers to {{the part of the}} planning process that is concerned with the regulation and management of changes to land use and development. Planning and zoning have a great political dimension, with governments often criticized for favouring developers; also <b>nimbyism</b> is very prevalent.|$|E
50|$|In 1856 a {{site was}} {{reserved}} for a mental asylum next to the river. By 1871 Kew Lunatic Asylum, now known as Willsmere Estate, was completed. The Kew Cottages for children were added in 1887. The hospital was built despite objections by residents and the Kew Borough Council and provides an historical example of <b>NIMBYism.</b> Kew Cottages and Willsmere Hospital are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.|$|E
5000|$|NIMBY (an {{acronym for}} the phrase [...] "Not In My Back Yard"), or Nimby, is a pejorative {{characterization}} of opposition by residents to {{a proposal for}} a new development because it is close to them (or, in some cases, because the development involves controversial or potentially dangerous technology) often with the connotation that such residents believe that the developments are needed in society but should be further away. The residents are often called Nimbys, and their state of mind is called <b>Nimbyism.</b>|$|E
50|$|Despite {{this general}} {{support for the}} concept of wind power in the public at large, local {{opposition}} often exists, primarily from residents concerned about visual and light pollution, noise or reduced property values. The construction of wind turbines has {{a negative effect on}} rural communities, owing to the fact that landowners who receive payments to allow wind turbines on their land are seen as sellouts who are unconcerned with the windmills' effect on their neighbours. Public opposition has had the desired effect in some cases, aborting or delaying construction of windmills. This opposition {{has been described as a}} case of <b>NIMBYism.</b>|$|E
50|$|In February 1995, Ochten {{received}} {{international media}} attention {{because of a}} weakened dike after a prolonged period of high waterlevels in the rivers. This situation {{and the state of}} other dikes forced 250,000 people in this region to evacuate. The river levels had been unusually high for almost two months, reaching record heights during the first days of February. Although the dike started to shift, a huge rescue operation managed to stabilize the dike. Several months later the already planned strengthening of the dike started with almost no opposition. Some people who opposed the strengthening before the evacuation, mainly because of <b>NIMBYism,</b> were harassed by some locals.|$|E
5000|$|Proposals to add {{social housing}} and {{services}} for the addicted and/or mentally ill to other Metro Vancouver neighbourhoods are often met with <b>Nimbyism,</b> even when residents selected for such projects would be low-risk individuals. A 2012 poll of Metro Vancouver residents found that although nine out of 10 of those surveyed wanted the homeless {{to have access to}} services they need, 54% believed that [...] "housing in their community should be there for the people who can afford it." [...] Some commentators have suggested that Vancouver residents tacitly agree to have the DTES act as a de facto ghetto for the most troubled individuals in the city.|$|E
5000|$|Now and {{for over}} a decade, a {{struggle}} has been brewing in San Francisco, California between the voting public and the influx of young professionals and tech workers. With no room to expand, construction companies can only build up {{in order to meet}} the increasing housing demand. However, <b>NIMBYism</b> has prevented high rise construction from spreading in San Francisco, citing restrictions on buildings' shadows and the dramatic changes proposed to the waterfront skyline. [...] The opposition argues that new construction will increase the supply of luxury housing without creating affordable housing, thus raising the average rent while by attracting a wealthier population to the city of San Francisco and forcing middle and lower income families out of the city.|$|E
50|$|In March 2003, VicTrack {{announced}} plans to develop the airspace over the site, including decking over the station platforms and the adjacent marshalling yard, with 3-4 levels of car park, and 3-4 storeys of commercial space. The original plans, involving the station's demolition, led to protests from the local community, receiving {{a significant amount of}} media attention, with actor Geoffrey Rush and comedian Barry Humphries publicly backing the campaign, heading a protest march up Burke Road from Camberwell Junction to the station. The comedian performed a poem about planners at the rally, and noted that the railway line was sometimes called 'The Orient Express'. To those supporting development of the station, the actions of the protesters have been taken as an example of <b>NIMBYism.</b>|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{developments}} require engagement programmes {{in which}} the 'community' is 'consulted' with respect to incoming developments, often with blunt tools such as focus groups, which often result in lack of representation and input, or at worst can result in <b>NIMBYism.</b> With crowd-funded models, forms of engagement are built into the process, enabling a kind of emergent urbanism, in which use of space is optimised on terms set by its users. This reclamation of people's power {{can be seen as}} a soft, spatial version of Hacktivism. Open-source architecture is likely to suffer some of the organizational drawbacks of open-source software, such as forking of projects, abandoned projects, the emergence of cliques and incompatibility with the installed base of buildings. Organized campaigns of fear, uncertainty and doubt are probable.|$|E
5000|$|PIBBY is {{an acronym}} for [...] "Place In Blacks' Back Yard." [...] This {{principle}} indicates that the people with social, racial, and economic privileges object to a development in their own back yards, and if the objectionable item must be built, then it should be built so that its perceived harms disproportionately affect poor, socially disadvantaged people. Economically disadvantaged people {{might not want to}} hire a lawyer to appeal the right way, or might have more immediate troubles than a new nearby construction project. The environmental justice movement has critiqued <b>Nimbyism</b> as a form of environmental racism. Robert D. Bullard, Director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University, has argued that official responses to NIMBY phenomena have led to the PIBBY principle.|$|E

5000|$|Particularly in the {{run up to}} {{the final}} {{decision}} on {{the route of the}} high-speed railway known as High Speed 2, BBC News Online reported that many residents of Conservative constituencies were launching objections to the HS2 route based on the effects it would have on them, whilst also showing concerns that HS2 is unlikely to have a societal benefit at a macro level under the current economic circumstances. Likewise, Labour MP Natascha Engel—through whose constituency the line will pass—offered a [...] "passionate defence of nimbyism" [...] in the House of Commons, with regards to the effects the line would have on home- and business-owning constituents. [...] HS2 has also been characterised by residents of the Chilterns and Camden making arguments against the supposed lack of a business case for the line, often as a smokescreen for <b>NIMBYism.</b> On 17 March 2014, it was announced that Camden's NIMBYs were successful in their campaign to derail the HS1-HS2 link railway http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26604074.|$|E
5000|$|NASA Climate {{scientist}} James Hansen {{discusses the}} problem with rapid phase out of fossil fuels and said that while it is conceivable {{in places such as}} New Zealand and Norway, [...] "suggesting that renewables will let us phase rapidly off fossil fuels in the United States, China, India, or {{the world as a whole}} is almost the equivalent of believing in the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy." [...] In 2013, Smil analyzed proposals to depend on wind and solar-generated electricity including the proposals of Jacobson and colleagues, and writing in an issue of Spectrum prepared by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, he identified numerous points of concern, such as cost, intermittent power supply, growing <b>NIMBYism,</b> and a lack of infrastructure as negative factors and said that [...] "History and a consideration of the technical requirements show that the problem is much greater than these advocates have supposed." [...] Smil and Hansen are concerned about the variable output of solar and wind power, but American physicist Amory Lovins has said that the electricity grid can cope, just as it routinely backs up nonworking coal-fired and nuclear plants with working ones.|$|E
5000|$|The Commons Transport Committee, {{which in}} November 2011 {{reported}} that the scheme had [...] "a good case" [...] and offered [...] "a new era of inter-urban travel in Britain." [...] However, it also said {{there should be a}} firm commitment made now to extend the line to Manchester and Leeds and that other investment in rail should not suffer, and noted a poor level of public debate which had failed to address the facts and had resorted to name-calling and accusations of <b>nimbyism.</b> While questioning some data, it found a good economic case for the project bringing more benefits than a conventional classic rail line, that the noise impact would be less than feared and that while it would not reduce carbon dioxide emissions they would be smaller than under further motorway or air traffic expansion and that the business case for diverting via Heathrow had not been made. The report's findings were welcomed by the Association of Train Operating Companies, the Campaign for Better Transport, the Countryside Alliance and the Campaign to Protect Rural England. Action Groups Against High Speed Two (AGHAST) condemned the authors as a 'partisan committee' though they welcomed some of the findings, saying it poked holes in the Government's arguments.|$|E
50|$|Climate {{change and}} the {{political}} response to it is already defining a new fault line in the culture. On one side of that line will be a global <b>NIMBYism</b> that sees the planet as too fragile to support the hopes and dreams of seven billion humans. It will seek to establish and enforce the equivalent of an international caste {{system in which the}} poor of the developing world are consigned to energy poverty in perpetuity. This politics of limits will be anti-immigration, anti-globalization, and anti-growth. It will be zero-sum, fiscally conservative, and deficit-oriented. It will combine Malthusian environmentalism with Hobbesian conservatism. On the other side will be those who believe that there is room enough {{for all of us to}} live secure and free lives. It will be pro-growth, progressive, and internationalist. It will drive global development by creating new markets. It will see in institutions like the WTO, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund not a corporate conspiracy to keep people poor and destroy the environment, but an opportunity to drive a kind of development that is both sustainable and equitable. It will embrace technology without being technocratic. It will seek adaptation proactively, not fatalistically. It will establish social and economic security as preconditions for ecological action. It will be large and transformative, but not millenarian.|$|E
5000|$|CSX {{released}} its Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) in July 2013. During the comment period, many Capitol Hill and Navy Yard residents raised {{objections to the}} DEIS. Organizations which submitted comments to CSX criticizing elements of the DEIS include Casey Trees, the Capitol Hill Restoration Society (CHRS), the Sierra Club, and the Committee of 100 on the Federal City. CHRS filed an additional comment concerning review of the Virginia Avenue Tunnel project under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, raising concerns about negative project impacts on historic structures (including those of religious and military value), economic impact on Barracks Row Main Street, and the project's [...] "adverse effect on the L'Enfant Plan." [...] Individuals {{in favor of the}} tunnel have dismissed the claims as being a classic case of <b>NIMBYism.</b> The United States Environmental Protection Agency also released an official opinion on the DEIS in which they identified in detail [...] "deficiencies and areas of concern, including environmental justice, children's environmental health, cumulative impacts, and community impacts, especially vibration, parks, visual, and utility disruptions." [...] CSX stated in the DEIS that it wishes to keep rail traffic moving during the construction by using the cut and cover method, which would avoid over-stressing their infrastructure while lowering the cost of the project. This would require the on-and-off closure of varying parts of Virginia Avenue for three years, however.|$|E
5000|$|In 1902, the {{bubonic plague}} broke {{out among the}} {{population}} which the authorities soon blamed on [...] "these uncontrolled Kafir hordes" [...] (Iliffe, p. 115) leading to many whites demanding segregation. According to the Cape Town Medical Officer of Health the living conditions of Africans were 'very undesirable, both {{from the point of}} view of sanitation and socially, by bringing uncleanly, half-civilised units into intimate contact with the more cleanly and civilised portion of the community". (Illustrated History of South Africa, pp. 314-5). It was as a result of this that Ndabeni was established, Cape Town's first black township (Richmond, p. 48). The location was, at the time, on the Cape Flats near a sewage plant (Iliffe, p. 115). [...] "Natives who were living under insanitary conditions in the slums of Cape Town were offered accommodation at low rental in Ndabeni" [...] (Wilson & Mafeje, p. 3), although several thousand remained in the city. Iliffe suggests the number moved to the township is in the 6,000 - 7,000 range, [...] "many at bayonet-point". In an early example of <b>Nimbyism</b> local residents objected to Cape Town [...] "shunting its kaffirs" [...] in their direction. There were also complaints from Cape Town merchants that it would be inconvenient to have their workers housed out of town. The Cape Register replied in March 1901, [...] "The protection of the metropolis from the insanitary disease-spreading nigger is a much more vital matter than the convenience of a few St George Street merchants". (Illustrated History of South Africa, p. 315).|$|E
40|$|UK {{energy policy}} {{contains}} ambitious goals for increased deployment {{of renewable energy}} technologies (RETs), but concern remains about the potential of local opposition to obstruct proposed developments. Despite emerging academic consensus that characterizing opposition to RET siting as <b>NIMBYism</b> is problematic, the discourse remains strong in popular debate. This article responds to calls for sociological research on both ascriptions of <b>NIMBYism</b> {{and the use of}} deficit models. Through an analysis of interviews with key actors in the renewable energy industry, we explore the ways in which a discourse of <b>NIMBYism</b> is evident in their descriptions of local wind farm opponents. We conceptualize this discourse as embodying an array of deficit models of the public and public knowledge. This is significant not only because developers' constructions of publics inform their modes of engagement with them, but also because they may influence public responses themselves...|$|E

40|$|This article {{provides}} a critical {{introduction to the}} concept of <b>NIMBYism.</b> NIMBY is an acronym from N(ot) I(n) M(y) B(ack) Y(ard) used to describe opponents of new developments who recognise that a facility or technology is needed but are opposed to its siting within their locality. The article starts by discussing the origin of the concept and indicates some of the complexity in the literature. Alternative ways of understanding local opposition (as ignorant, selfish, or based on valid concerns and interests) and corresponding ways of responding to it are outlined. Research has increasingly moved away from a focus on the negative attributes of individual opponents as ignorant and selfish to engage with the broader motivations and contexts of local opposition. The article concludes by documenting recent calls for an end to using the language of <b>NIMBYism...</b>|$|E

40|$|Wind power {{development}} has produced controversies in many places. Some people see wind {{power as a}} sustainable source of energy, others see it as destroying nature and landscapes. The opposition to wind power is often asserted to be from local forces and <b>NIMBYism,</b> and support {{to be based on}} the national and global benefits of increased supply of renewable energy. In this paper, I challenge this view by analyzing how local communities with established or planned wind power parks went through the process of developing wind power, what arguments they used and how they think about the wind power technology and its expected local effects. I found that most of the arguments in favor of wind power development addressed local concerns regarding the economy, modernization, and employment opportunities and not a need for sustainable energy. The opposition to wind power development was not based on <b>NIMBYism.</b> Rather, many different arguments were used, and the features of the controversies were distinct to each community...|$|E
40|$|The United States??? {{electric}} grid needs an update {{to relieve congestion}} and add capacity for new renewable energy. While the White House and the electric industry recognize that new transmission lines need to be built, public opposition to transmission lines can be strong. Often, project proponents label public opposition as <b>NIMBYism</b> (Not In My Backyard) to avoid addressing the public???s concerns. This research analyzes whether this label is a fair and accurate depiction of the public with the objective to evaluate the most prominent motivations for public opposition. Primary qualitative methods include analysis of the language and intent of each public comment published in Environmental Impact Reports for six proposed electric transmission lines in California. This study concludes that <b>NIMBYism</b> is not a true factor in public opposition of an unwanted project. Research findings reveal that every project has {{a unique set of}} reasons for opposition of a project depending on a number of factors...|$|E
40|$|Citizens {{benefit from}} {{essential}} infrastructure like hazardous waste disposal facilities, {{but they do}} not want such facilities to be located in their own neighborhood. Local zoning allows communities to keep waste facilities out; as a result, siting them has proven increasingly difficult. Due to the continued need for such infrastructure, states have tried, often unsuccessfully, to combat NIMB Yism through preemption of local zoning. In 1981, Massachusetts adopted a siting law designed to use negotiated compensation as a means to overcome the NIMBY phenomenon. Private developers were to bargain freely with communities to establish terms for accepting a facility. The law 2 ̆ 7 s subsequent failure to lead to any new disposal sites does not disqualify negotiation as a realistic means of solving or alleviating <b>NIMBYism.</b> In fact, the law 2 ̆ 7 s ten year history provides vital insight into the obstacles that prevent parties from successfully negotiating their way around <b>NIMBYism.</b> Wheeler argues that, suitably reformed, the Massachusetts law offers a model way forward for planners and policymakers...|$|E
40|$|The threats {{posed by}} climate change are placing governments under {{increasing}} pressure to meet electricity demand from low-carbon sources. In many countries, including the UK, legislation {{is in place}} to ensure the continued expansion of renewable energy capacity. Onshore wind turbines are expected to {{play a key role}} in achieving these aims. However, despite high levels of public support for onshore wind development in principle, specific projects often experience local opposition. Traditionally this difference in general and specific attitudes has been attributed to <b>NIMBYism</b> (not in my back yard), but evidence is increasingly calling this assumption into question. This study used multiple regression analysis to identify what factors might predict attitudes towards mooted wind development in Sheffield, England. We report on the attitudes of two groups; one group (target) living close to four sites earmarked for development and an unaffected comparison group (comparison). We found little evidence of <b>NIMBYism</b> amongst members of the target group; instead, differences between general and specific attitudes appeared attributable to uncertainty regarding the proposals. The results are discussed with respect to literature highlighting the importance of early, continued and responsive community involvement in combating local opposition and facilitating the deployment of onshore wind turbines.

This paper addresses this deficiency by examining the determinants of tourist preferences over the position of offshore wind farms at different distances from the shore in the Mediterranean Sea. A principal component analysis is used to retrieve general attitudinal themes, which act as covariates in a choice model. We demonstrate the role of respondents’ opinions on energy policy, perceived urgency of tackling climate change, NIMBY objections, nationality and education in explaining preferences for the siting of offshore wind farms...|$|E
