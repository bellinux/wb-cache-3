40|$|A test chip was {{designed}} and manufactured {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of various test techniques. In this report, defective CUTs are classified into two groups: Fail-Some-Test-Set (FSTS) CUTs and Fail-All-Test-Set (FATS) CUTs. This study shows that, in general, FATS CUTs can be detected by fewer vectors. The efficiency of different test sets is also discussed in terms of how fast the defective CUTs can be detected. The result of this study in comparing test results at nominal voltage and at very low voltage (VLV) is also shown in this report. Classification of timing-dependent defects and sequence-dependent defects are examined using test results from a timing which is at least 30 times slower than <b>nominal</b> <b>timing.</b> Seven percent of CUTs have different test results in different clock speed.

40|$|The {{design of}} budget rules and institutions, long a {{neglected}} area in public finance and macroeconomics, {{has recently been}} thrust to center stage by the debate over {{a balanced budget amendment}} and other deficit-reduction measures in the United States. This paper describes the existing evidence on how budget rules affect fiscal policy outcomes. It contrasts the `institutional irrelevance view,' which holds that budget rules can be circumvented by modifying accounting practices and changing the <b>nominal</b> <b>timing</b> or other classification of taxes and expenditures, with the `public choice view' in which fiscal institutions represent important constraints on the behavior of political actors. Several distinct strands of empirical evidence, from the U. S. federal experience with anti-deficit rules, from U. S. state experience with balanced budget rules, and from international comparisons of budget outcomes in nations with different fiscal institutions, suggest that fiscal institutions do matter. These results reject the institutional irrelevance view. The existing evidence is not refined enough, however, to provide detailed advice on how narrowly-defined changes in budget rules might affect policy outcomes. ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a software program}} that functions as a radio clock using shortwave radio signals transmitted by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) radio stations WWV and WWVH. Operated in conjunction with an inexpensive, fixed-frequency shortwave radio, it has <b>nominal</b> <b>timing</b> errors less than 125 µs when tracking one of the stations and frequency variations less than 0. 5 parts-per-million (PPM) when not tracking either station. The clock produces an ASCII timecode {{that can be used}} to set the time of another device, such as a computer, as well as precision reference signals that can be used for other purposes, such as to drive laboratory test equipment. The primary motivation for this report is as an example and case study of optimum demodulator and decoder design using a maximum likelihood approach and matched filter, synchronous detection and soft decision principles. The clock discipline is modelled as a Markov process, with probabilistic state transitions corresponding to a conventional time-of-century clock and the probabilities of received decimal digits. The result is a performance level which results in very high accuracy and reliability, even under conditions when the one-minute beep from the WWV/...|$|E
40|$|When {{the choice}} of the <b>nominal</b> anchor and <b>timing</b> of {{inflation}} stabilization is analyzed with models of political business cycles, there is room for political opportunism of policymakers. The different business cycles associated with exchange rate-based (ERBS) and money-based stabilizations (MBS) imply that the decision regarding the <b>timing</b> and <b>nominal</b> anchor of stabilization may be affected by the timing of elections. Namely, an opportunistic policymaker is more likely to implement an ERBS than a MBS before elections, while the opposite happens after elections. Empirical results obtained when estimating a multinomial logit model for a sample of 35 stabilization programs implemented in chronic inflation countries clearly support this hypothesis.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of contextual interference on the motor skill acquisition in function  of the functional and nominal difficulties of the task. The study included 160 adults of both genders with average age of 21. 3 (± 3. 3) years.  The design involved 8 groups of experienced and inexperienced individuals (functional difficulty) who practiced a simple or complex (<b>nominal</b> difficulty) coincident <b>timing</b> task, in a random or blocked condition. Performance was measure by the absolute, variable, and constant errors. Results did not show differences between random and blocked groups in all conditions of difficulty. Therefore, it was concluded that the effect of contextual interference is not dependent of the nominal and functional difficulties of the task...|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} {{a dynamic}} stochastic {{general equilibrium model}} that allows for regimes Markov switching (MS-DSGE). Existing MS-DSGE papers for the United States focus on changes in monetary policy or shocks volatility, contributing {{the debate on the}} Great Moderation and/or Volcker disinflation. However, Poland which here serves {{as an example of a}} transition country, faced a wider range of structural changes, including long disinflation, EU accession or tax changes. The model identifies high and low rigidity regimes, with the timing consistent with menu cost explanation of <b>nominal</b> rigidities. Estimated <b>timing</b> of the regimes captures the European Union accession and indirect tax changes. The Bayesian model comparison results suggest that model with switching in both analyzed rigidities is strongly favored by the data in comparison with switching only in prices or in wages. Moreover, we find significant evidence in support of independent Markov chains...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} process variations on the speedup and maximum frequency of the extended ISA processor. First, without considering the process variations, a custom functional unit (CFU) is designed based on <b>nominal</b> <b>timing</b> parameters and then the timing variations of critical paths of the extensible processor including the baseline processor and the CFU are investigated by considering both systematic and random variations. Next, the maximum frequency of the extensible processor and the speed enhancement factor of the extended ISA for different benchmarks are investigated. Results show that the timing variation could reduce the speedup of the extensible processor. However, this reduction is highly dependent on the baseline processor and the CFU structures. Additionally, the impact of process variations {{in the case of}} worst-case design approach is studied. Results show that the speedup of the extensible processor is reduced more than the case when custom instructions (CIs) are selected without considering the process variations. To study the impact of each variation type, speedup variations due to the random and systematic variations are investigated separately. The study reveals that the random variation has a similar effect on the CFU and the baseline processor, while the impact of the systematic variation on the baseline processor is greater than the CFU...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results of {{relocating}} 327, 000 southern California earthquakes that occurred between 1984 and 2002. We apply time-domain waveform cross-correlation for P and S waves between each event and 100 neighboring events identified from the catalog based on a 3 D velocity model. To simplify the computation, we first divide southern California into five polygons, such that there are ∼ 100, 000 events or less in each region. The polygon boundaries are chosen to lie in regions of sparse seismicity. We calculate and save differential times from the peaks in the cross-correlation functions and use a spline interpolation method to achieve a <b>nominal</b> <b>timing</b> precision of 0. 001 sec. These differential times, together with existing P- and S-phase picks, are input to the double-difference program of Waldhauser and Ellsworth (2000, 2002) to calculate refined hypocenters. We divide the southern California region into grid cells and successively relocate hypocenters within each grid cell. The overall resulting pattern of seismicity is more focused than the previously determined pattern from 1 D or 3 D models. The new improved locations are more clustered, in many cases {{by a factor of}} two or three, and often show clear linear alignments. In particular, the depth distribution is improved and less affected by layer boundaries in velocity models or other similar artifacts...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{geolocation}} of SAR imagery enables {{not only}} precise overlays with other data sources {{in a common}} map geometry, but also normalisation for the systematic influence of terrain on image radiometry. We begin by describing our verifications of the geometric behaviour of ENVISAT ASAR products, including all image mode (IM), alternating polarisation (AP), and wide swath (WS) types: IMS, IMP, IMM, IMG, APS, APP, APM, APG, WSM, and WSS. Radar transponders in Canada and Europe are used as easily identifiable targets in radar images to test {{the accuracy of the}} <b>nominal</b> <b>timing</b> and state vector annotations accompanying each product. Accuracies achievable using DORIS precise state vectors are also evaluated. In addition to ENVISAT's ASAR, geolocation accuracies achievable using ERS- 1 / 2 and ALOS PALSAR data are demonstrated. Given accurate knowledge of the acquisition geometry of a SAR image from one of the above sensors together with a digital elevation model (DEM) of the area imaged, the process of terrain geocoding is used to transform a diverse set of images into a common reference map geometry. The prerequisite DEM combined with accurate knowledge of the acquisition geometry also enables a radiometric correction, whereby variations in terrain specific to each scene are normalised to a common standard. Thematic interpretation benefits from such pre-processing: we demonstrate improved thematic discriminations using product overlays in a common map geometry where radiometric terrain correction (RTC) has been applied in comparison to typical GTC results...|$|E
40|$|Premixed charge {{compression}} ignition (PCCI) {{is widely considered}} to be a possible method of meeting increasingly strict emissions regulations in internal combustion engines. PCCI can reduce harmful emissions substantially {{and at the same time}} increase efficiency relative to conventional combustion modes. Because of the nature of PCCI, changes in in-cylinder conditions have a greater impact than in conventional diesel engines. Therefore cylinder to cylinder variations are amplified which leads to problems such as misfire and decreased efficiency in cylinders with increased ignition delay and lower apparent heat release rate (AHRR) amplitudes. Two possible methods to counteract this effect in diesel engines were studied. First a GT-POWER simulation showed that by altering the start of injection (SOI) for each cylinder individually it is possible to move the start of combustion (SOC) for individual cylinders back. Second a method of advancing SOC and increasing AHRR amplitudes by using early exhaust valve closing (EVC) to trap hot exhaust gases in cylinders was simulated in GT-POWER and analyzed. GT-POWER simulations showed that moving SOI forward successfully resulted in earlier SOCs. Through analysis of the same simulation data it was determined that SOI should be advance by 0 to 3. 44 crank angle degrees (CAD) from the <b>nominal</b> SOI <b>timing.</b> The simulations indicated that the EVC altering method would not have the desired effect on SOC and this result was analyzed. This work provides a method of decreasing cylinder to cylinder variations thus increasing the stability and efficiency of PCCI combustion...|$|R
40|$|In recent times, NOx and PM {{emission}} {{regulations for}} both light and heavy duty diesel engines {{have become very}} strict. Most engines meet these regulations using after-treatment systems. However, a major drawback of these after-treatment systems {{is that they are}} efficient in reducing emissions only when their catalyst temperature is within a certain range (usually around 250 °C to 450 °C). Thus the exhaust gases from the engine need to be at least 250 °C to attain satisfactory after-treatment performance. This is not a problem when the engine is operating at higher loads. However, at lower loads this is a major problem as the exhaust temperatures are typically much below 250 °C. This makes exhaust thermal management very important in diesel engines. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} explore intake valve timing modulation as a method for exhaust thermal management. The goal is to increase engine turbine out temperatures to ensure NOx and PM after-treatment systems operate efficiently. The first step in this work was to generate fuel consumption-NOx emissions trade-off curves for <b>nominal</b> IVC <b>timings</b> using a central composite design of experiments (DOE) and second order regression model based approach. This served as a baseline to compare fuel efficiency and NOx emissions for off-nominal valve timings. The effect of intake valve closing timing was studied on exhaust gas temperatures, fuel consumption, in-cylinder combustion and emissions by sweeping IVC timing, keeping other parameters constant at a given load-speed operating condition. A significant increase in turbine out temperature accompanied by a decrease in fuel consumption and NOx emissions was observed along the IVC sweep. Along the IVC sweep at 1200 RPM and 100 ft-lbf load, turbine out temperature went up from 200 °C to 250 °C accompanied by an increase in brake thermal efficiency from 31 % to 32. 5 % and a reduction in brake specific NOx from 6. 7 g/hp-hr to 3. 7 g/hp-hr. Combustion was found to shift from a diffusion mode to a more premixed mode. Increases in exhaust gas temperatures due to IVC modulation were due to a drop in air flow through the engine. This drop in air flow was due to a reduction in the volumetric efficiency. Regression models to understand the effect of air-to-fuel ratio on turbine out temperature and IVC timing on volumetric efficiency were developed. The increase in fuel efficiency was analyzed by breaking down the brake thermal efficiency into three components: closed cycle efficiency, open cycle efficiency and mechanical efficiency. It was found that the increase was due to a drop in the pumping penalty. Reduction in NOx was attributed to the combined effect of a drop in in-cylinder temperature due to reduction in piston induced compression and a shift to a more premixed combustion mode. The effect of both early and late intake valve closing was found to be identical. Areas of the engine operating map where IVC modulation would be most effective to keep the after-treatment system and to get the after-treatment system hot were identified. This study is a first step towards exploring intake valve modulation as a method for exhaust thermal management. Intake valve closing modulation seems to be a promising strategy for exhaust thermal management. ...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedProcess {{technology}} advancements {{are increasing}} coupling capacitance {{values and the}} resulting crosstalk-induced delay. As a result, noise and timing margins are decreasing and circuits' susceptibility to defects is increasing. The population of defects is also changing {{and the influence of}} fluctuations of process parameters during manufacturing {{is becoming more and more}} important due to process technology advancements.; Due to the above mentioned reasons, crosstalk-induced delay must not only be considered in timing verification but it must also be considered in post-fabrication testing together with realistic populations of manufacturing imperfections and process variations.; This dissertation focuses on testing for crosstalk-induced delay faults in the presence of delay faults caused by defects and process variations. Furthermore, with bridges being the predominant type of manufacturing defects in new technologies, this dissertation also focuses on testing for bridge-induced delay faults in the presence of other delay faults. In the presence of delay faults at unknown locations and of unknown sizes, <b>nominal</b> <b>timing</b> information is not valid. We present timing-independent approaches for testing for crosstalk- and bridge-induced delay faults. Using these approaches, under certain circumstances, tests are generated that guarantee testing for crosstalk- or bridge-induced delay faults. No existing approach generates tests that can provide such a guarantee.; Certain assumptions about the nature of defects and process variations and the resulting delay faults can be exploited in the test methodology that result in higher coverage of crosstalk or bridge sites and also lower test generation and test application costs. These assumptions and their ramifications are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{timing of}} the valves of a {{hydraulic}} motor {{plays an important role}} in determining the throttling energy. To reduce this dominating energy loss, the {{timing of the}} valves must allow the fluid in the chamber to be precompressed and decompressed such that there is minimal pressure differential across the transitioning valve. The optimal valve timing to achieve precompression and decompression is a function of the motor displacement, angular velocity, pressure, and air content of the fluid, thus to achieve high efficiency at all conditions, active valve timing is required. The valves in most hydraulic motor architectures are mechanically timed to the piston displacement, rendering it impossible to change the valve timing as a function of operating conditions. This paper presents one novel valve architecture that allows for such processes: a rotary valve that is controlled independently of the piston displacement, enabling active timing control. To validate the concept and test the motor valve at fixed timing and fixed displacement conditions, a prototype valve was installed on a single cylinder 3. 5 cc/rev slider-crank piston motor. The <b>nominal</b> <b>timing</b> of the valve was optimized for operation for a pressure of 7 MPa, 2 % entrained air by volume, and an angular velocity between 10 and 30 Hz. A model, including the pressure dynamics, leakage, compressibility, check valve dynamics, and geometry dependent parameters is developed, simulated, and compared to the experiment. The experimental system includes instrumentation for measuring the inlet and outlet flow rates, piston position, and pressure in the inlet, outlet, and cylinder. A comparison between the model and experimental data shows good agreement and demonstrate the large impact of valve timing on efficiency...|$|E
