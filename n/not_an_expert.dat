25|$|Abbas {{has since}} {{confirmed}} that {{he turned down}} an Israeli offer for a Palestinian state on nearly 95% of the West Bank. In September 2008, Olmert had presented him with a map that delineated {{the borders of the}} proposed PA state, for which Israel would annex 6.3 percent of the West Bank and compensate the Palestinians with 5.8 percent (taken from pre-1967 Israel), which Abbas stated he rejected out of hand, insisting instead to demarcate the June 4, 1967 borders of Palestine. He said that Olmert did not give a map of the proposal and that he could not sign without seeing the proposal. Abbas also said that he was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> on maps and pointed to Olmert's corruption investigation (he was later convicted). Abbas said in October 2011 that he made a counteroffer to let Israel annex 1.9% of the West Bank.|$|E

He says: [...] "the choice of poison was genius in that polonium, carried in a vial in water, can be carried in a pocket through airport screening devices without setting off any alarms", adding, [...] "once administered, the polonium creates symptoms that don't suggest poison for days, allowing time for the perpetrator to make a getaway." [...] Priest asserts that [...] "whoever did it was probably <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> in radiation protection, so they probably didn't realize how much contamination you can get just by opening the top (of the vial) and closing it again. With the right equipment, you can detect just one count per second".|$|E

Although Christopher's condition is not stated, the book's blurb refers to Asperger syndrome, high-functioning autism, or savant syndrome. In July 2009, Haddon wrote on his blog that [...] "Curious Incident is not a book about Asperger's... if anything it's a novel about difference, about being an outsider, about seeing the world in a surprising and revealing way. The book is not specifically about any specific disorder," [...] and that he, Haddon, is <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> on autism spectrum disorder or Asperger syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|David Mavorah, {{a curator}} of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, {{points out that the}} names on the ossuaries were {{extremely}} common. [...] "We know that Joseph, Jesus and Mariamne were all among the most common names of the period. To start with all these names being together in a single tomb and leap from there to say this is the tomb of Jesus is a little far-fetched, to put it politely." [...] David Mavorah is an expert of Israeli Antiquity, and (presumably) <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> of statistics. However, Dr. Andrey Feuerverger, the statistician cited by the makers of the documentary, has said that determination of the identity of those in the tomb was the purview of biblical historians, and not statisticians. For another interpretation of the statistics see the statistics section above.|$|E

2500|$|WWE quickly {{responded to}} Nowinski's accusations, saying, [...] "It is very dubious {{that he ever}} had a {{conversation}} with Lance Cade much less Lance Cade confiding to a total stranger that he used painkillers and steroids." [...] The company also sought to discredit Nowinski by claiming that he had failed to disclose that he'd suffered previous concussions before signing his contract with WWE, as was required. They further disputed his claims as to the number of days wrestlers worked, on average, and observed that despite Nowinski's renown in the area of CTE, a form of brain injury resulting from repeated concussions, he is <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> in matters relating to steroids or pain killers. The charge that Nowinski was a [...] "stranger" [...] to Cade was refuted by Nowinski: He and Lance Cade had been tag team partners during 2002–2003, and co-workers until 2007.|$|E
2500|$|The English poet John Masefield, {{following}} in the footsteps of peers like Rudyard Kipling, seized upon shanties as a nostalgic literary device, and included them along with much older, non-shanty sea songs in his 1906 collection A Sailor's Garland. Though Masefield had sea experience (1891–95), he was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> on shanties and the versions he gave of songs cannot be assumed entirely authentic. For example, he admits to never having heard a pumping shanty, and yet he goes on to present one without citing its source. In one of his earlier articles, his shanties are set to melodies taken verbatim from Davis and Tozer's earlier work, and he mentions having utilized that and the other widely available collection (L.A. Smith, 1888) as resources. Masefield desired to connect shanties with much older English traditions and literature, and his characterization of individual items as such would prove attractive to later enthusiasts. So for example, Masefield implied that the shanty [...] "A-roving" [...] (which he titled [...] "The Maid of Amsterdam") was derived from Thomas Heywood's The Tragedy of the Rape of Lucrece (1608). Lyrics and ideas from Masefield's collection became among the most quoted or plagiarized in later shanty collections, and by their sheer ubiquity these contributed to 20th century audiences' perceptions of the genre.|$|E
