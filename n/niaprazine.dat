50|$|<b>Niaprazine</b> {{has been}} shown to metabolize to the {{compound}} pFPP in a similar manner to how trazodone and nefazodone metabolize to mCPP. It is unclear what role, if any, pFPP plays in the clinical effects of <b>niaprazine.</b> However, from animal studies it is known that pFPP, unlike <b>niaprazine,</b> does not produce sedative effects, and instead exerts a behavioral profile indicative of serotonergic activation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Niaprazine</b> {{is a drug}} {{related to}} this group but does not inhibit the reuptake of {{serotonin}} or the other monoamines.|$|E
50|$|<b>Niaprazine</b> (INN) (brand name Nopron) is a sedative-hypnotic drug of the phenylpiperazine group. It {{has been}} used in the {{treatment}} of sleep disturbances since the early 1970s in several European countries including France, Italy, and Luxembourg. It is commonly used with children and adolescents on account of its favorable safety and tolerability profile and lack of abuse potential.|$|E
5000|$|... pFPP was {{originally}} discovered as a metabolite of the hypnotic antihistamine <b>niaprazine</b> in 1982, but was rediscovered in 2003 {{as a potential}} recreational drug, and sold as an ingredient in [...] "Party pills" [...] in New Zealand, under brand names such as [...] "The Big Grin", [...] "Mashed", and [...] "Extreme Beans". Subsequently it has continued {{to be used as}} an ingredient in black market [...] "ecstasy" [...] pills around the world.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{believed}} {{to act as}} an antihistamine and anticholinergic, <b>niaprazine</b> was later discovered to have low or no binding affinity for the H1 and mACh receptors (Ki = > 1 μM), and was instead found to act as a potent and selective 5-HT2A and α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist (Ki = 75 nM and 86 nM, respectively). It possesses low or no affinity for the 5-HT1A, 5-HT2B, D2, and β-adrenergic, as well as at SERT and VMAT (Ki = all > 1 μM), but it does have some affinity for the α2-adrenergic receptor (Ki = 730 nM), likely acting as an antagonist there as well.|$|E
40|$|Background Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC) is {{a severe}} disorder. Several drugs have been {{administered}} as prophylaxis for paroxysmal attacks, however, no therapy is completely effective. Methods Our {{aim is to}} review the pharmacological data related to the prophylactic and acute treatment of a cohort of 30 patients (16  M, 14  F, age range 5 – 42  years) and to correlate them with the clinical and genetic data collected through the Italian Biobank and Clinical Registry for AHC. Results Flunarizine was {{the most commonly used}} long-term treatment in the cohort; it reduced duration and frequency of attacks in 50 % of patients and decreased intensity in 32. 1 %. In younger patients, flunarizine seemed significantly more effective in reducing intensity. We found no correlation between the effectiveness of flunarizine and genotype, or between developmental outcome and duration of treatment. In particular, 3 of our patients affected by E 815 K mutation presented rapid neurological deterioration despite ongoing treatment. Among the other administered prophylactic therapies, few proved to be effective (benzodiazepines, <b>niaprazine,</b> acetazolamide, melatonin, olanzapine, ketogenic diet). No clear rationale exists regarding their use, but these therapies may work by reducing the triggering factors. Conclusions The presented data are retrospective, but they are aimed at filling a gap given the rarity of the disease and the lack of randomized and controlled studies. Besides their usefulness in clarifying the pathophysiology of the disease, prospective studies involving larger cohorts of ATP 1 A 3 mutated AHC patients are needed to provide a rationale for testing other molecules...|$|E
