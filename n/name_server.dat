The domain registrar changed the <b>name</b> <b>server</b> of the website without telling Eiland-Hall; after contacting the registrar, he was permitted to return to his original <b>name</b> <b>server.</b> In an interview with Gawker on September 9, 2009, Eiland-Hall remarked that Beck's attorneys contacted the registrar of the domain, his hosting provider, as well as the company which housed the servers for his website. He noted that the hosting provider informed him they would not cooperate with the requests from Beck's lawyers unless they received a court order.|$|E
25|$|An {{authoritative}} <b>name</b> <b>server</b> is a <b>name</b> <b>server</b> {{that only}} gives answers to DNS queries from data {{that has been}} configured by an original source, for example, the domain administrator or by dynamic DNS methods, in contrast to answers obtained via a query to another <b>name</b> <b>server</b> that only maintains a cache of data.|$|E
25|$|Monolith Innovations, as {{a domain}} <b>name</b> <b>server,</b> was {{popular in the}} mid-1990s.|$|E
50|$|There are 13 logical root <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> specified, with logical {{names in}} the form letter.root-servers.net, where letter ranges from a to m. The choice of {{thirteen}} <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> was made because of limitations in the original DNS specification, which specifies a maximum packet size of 512 bytes when using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Technically however, fourteen <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> fit into an IPv4 packet. The addition of IPv6 addresses for the root <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> requires more than 512 bytes, which is facilitated by the EDNS0 extension to the DNS standard.|$|R
50|$|AlterNIC started {{operating}} their registries {{even though}} their <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> {{were not included in}} the Internet official root zone. As a result, only users of manually reconfigured <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> were able to resolve AlterNIC names.|$|R
25|$|The Domain Name System is {{maintained}} by a distributed database system, which uses the clientâ€“server model. The nodes of this database are the <b>name</b> <b>servers.</b> Each domain {{has at least}} one authoritative DNS server that publishes information about that domain and the <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> of any domains subordinate to it. The top of the hierarchy is served by the root <b>name</b> <b>servers,</b> the servers to query when looking up (resolving) a TLD.|$|R
25|$|The Internet {{maintains}} {{two principal}} namespaces, the domain name hierarchy and the Internet Protocol (IP) address spaces. The Domain Name System maintains the domain name hierarchy and provides translation services {{between it and}} the address spaces. Internet name servers and a communication protocol implement the Domain Name System. A DNS <b>name</b> <b>server</b> is a server that stores the DNS records for a domain; a DNS <b>name</b> <b>server</b> responds with answers to queries against its database.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of DNS caching and recursive functions in a <b>name</b> <b>server</b> is not mandatory; the functions {{can be implemented}} independently in servers for special purposes.|$|E
25|$|Every DNS zone must be {{assigned}} {{a set of}} authoritative name servers. This set of servers is stored in the parent domain zone with <b>name</b> <b>server</b> (NS) records.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} several {{alternative}} namespace systems {{with an alternative}} DNS root using their own set of root <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> that exist in parallel to the mainstream <b>name</b> <b>servers.</b> The first, AlterNIC, generated {{a substantial amount of}} press.|$|R
30|$|DNS is a {{distributed}} infrastruture, and {{a single}} domain is often served by mutliple <b>name</b> <b>servers.</b> Furthermore, many <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> are also distributed, e.g., via the ANYCAST technology, [RFC 1546], where a DNS request is rerouted to the topologically nearest nameserver.|$|R
5000|$|Authoritative server: {{authoritative}} <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> publish DNS mappings for domains {{under their}} authoritative control. Typically, a company (e.g. [...] "Acme Example Widgets") would provide its own authority services {{to respond to}} address queries, or for other DNS information, for www.example.int. These servers are listed as being {{at the top of}} the authority chain for their respective domains, and are capable of providing a definitive answer. Authoritative <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> can be primary <b>name</b> <b>servers,</b> also known as master servers, i.e. they contain the original set of data, or they can be secondary or slave <b>name</b> <b>servers,</b> containing data copies usually obtained from synchronization directly with the master server, either via a DNS mechanism, or by other data store synchronization mechanisms.|$|R
25|$|Administrative {{responsibility}} {{over any}} zone may be divided by creating additional zones. Authority {{over the new}} zone {{is said to be}} delegated to a designated <b>name</b> <b>server.</b> The parent zone ceases to be authoritative for the new zone.|$|E
25|$|Typically, such caching DNS servers also {{implement}} the recursive algorithm necessary {{to resolve a}} given name starting with the DNS root through to the authoritative name servers of the queried domain. With this function implemented in the <b>name</b> <b>server,</b> user applications gain efficiency in design and operation.|$|E
25|$|An {{authoritative}} <b>name</b> <b>server</b> {{can either}} be a master server or a slave server. A master server is a server that stores the original (master) copies of all zone records. A slave server uses a special automatic updating mechanism in the DNS protocol in communication with its master to maintain an identical copy of the master records.|$|E
25|$|For COM and NET domain names, a thin {{registry}} {{model is}} used. The domain registry (e.g., VeriSign) holds basic WHOIS data (i.e., registrar and <b>name</b> <b>servers,</b> etc.) One {{can find the}} detailed WHOIS (registrant, <b>name</b> <b>servers,</b> expiry dates, etc.) at the registrars.|$|R
50|$|<b>Name</b> <b>servers</b> are {{assigned}} on a per-domain basis and managed by a web host. Every domain name {{appears in a}} zone served {{by one or more}} authoritative <b>name</b> <b>servers.</b> The fully qualified domain names of the authoritative <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> of a zone are listed in the NS records of that zone. If the server for a zone is not also authoritative for its parent zone, the server for the parent zone must be configured with a delegation for the zone.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Name</b> <b>servers.</b> Most registrars provide {{two or more}} <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> {{as part of the}} {{registration}} service. However, a registrant may specify its own authoritative <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> to host a domain's resource records. The registrar's policies govern the number of servers and the type of server information required. Some providers require a hostname and the corresponding IP address or just the hostname, which must be resolvable either in the new domain, or exist elsewhere. Based on traditional requirements (RFC 1034), typically a minimum of two servers is required.|$|R
25|$|An {{authoritative}} server indicates {{its status}} of supplying definitive answers, deemed authoritative, by setting a protocol flag, called the Authoritative Answer (AA) bit in its responses. This flag is usually reproduced {{prominently in the}} output of DNS administration query tools, such as dig, {{to indicate that the}} responding <b>name</b> <b>server</b> is an authority for the domain name in question.|$|E
25|$|Name servers in {{delegations}} {{are identified}} by name, {{rather than by}} IP address. This means that a resolving <b>name</b> <b>server</b> must issue another DNS request {{to find out the}} IP address of the server to which it has been referred. If the name given in the delegation is a subdomain of the domain for which the delegation is being provided, there is a circular dependency.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, four UC Berkeley students, Douglas Terry, Mark Painter, David Riggle, and Songnian Zhou, {{wrote the}} first Unix <b>name</b> <b>server</b> {{implementation}} for the Berkeley Internet Name Domain, {{commonly referred to as}} BIND. In 1985, Kevin Dunlap of DEC substantially revised the DNS implementation. Mike Karels, Phil Almquist, and Paul Vixie have maintained BIND since then. In the early 1990s, BIND was ported to the Windows NT platform. It was widely distributed, especially on Unix systems, and is still the most widely used DNS software on the Internet.|$|E
30|$|Dependencies {{within the}} DNS {{infrastructure}} further exacerbate {{the impact of}} cache poisoning attacks or compromises of <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> or registrars [11]. We consider the following types of dependencies: (1) inter-domain dependencies via transitive trust and (2) zones coresidence due to <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> sharing and (3) dependencies via registrars.|$|R
25|$|In theory, {{authoritative}} <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> {{are sufficient}} for {{the operation of the}} Internet. However, with only authoritative <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> operating, every DNS query must start with recursive queries at the root zone of the Domain Name System and each user system would have to implement resolver software capable of recursive operation.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{any local}} {{implementation}} of DNS can implement its own private root <b>name</b> <b>servers,</b> the term [...] "root name server" [...] is generally {{used to describe}} the thirteen well-known root <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> that implement the root name space domain for the Internet's official global implementation of the Domain Name System.|$|R
25|$|The DNS {{resolver}} {{will almost}} invariably have a cache (see above) containing recent lookups. If the cache {{can provide the}} answer to the request, the resolver will return the value in the cache to the program that made the request. If the cache does not contain the answer, the resolver will send the request to one or more designated DNS servers. In the case of most home users, the Internet service provider to which the machine connects will usually supply this DNS server: such a user will either have configured that server's address manually or allowed DHCP to set it; however, where systems administrators have configured systems to use their own DNS servers, their DNS resolvers point to separately maintained name servers of the organization. In any event, the <b>name</b> <b>server</b> thus queried will follow the process outlined above, until it either successfully finds a result or does not. It then returns its results to the DNS resolver; assuming it has found a result, the resolver duly caches that result for future use, and hands the result back to the software which initiated the request.|$|E

More than 12,000 species are currently known (with upper estimates of the potential existence of about 22,000) (see the article List of ant genera), with the greatest diversity in the tropics. Taxonomic studies continue to resolve the classification and systematics of ants. Online databases of ant species, including AntBase and the Hymenoptera <b>Name</b> <b>Server,</b> help {{to keep track of the}} known and newly described species. The relative ease with which ants may be sampled and studied in ecosystems has made them useful as indicator species in biodiversity studies.|$|E
2500|$|In this case, the <b>name</b> <b>server</b> {{providing}} the delegation must also provide {{one or more}} IP addresses for the authoritative <b>name</b> <b>server</b> mentioned in the delegation. This information is called glue. [...] The delegating <b>name</b> <b>server</b> provides this glue {{in the form of}} records in the additional section of the DNS response, and provides the delegation in the authority section of the response. A glue record is a combination of the <b>name</b> <b>server</b> and IP address.|$|E

2500|$|For example, if the {{authoritative}} <b>name</b> <b>server</b> for example.org is ns1.example.org, a computer {{trying to resolve}} www.example.org first resolves ns1.example.org. Since ns1 is contained in example.org, this requires resolving example.org first, which presents a circular dependency. To break the dependency, the <b>name</b> <b>server</b> for the top level domain org includes glue along with the delegation for example.org. [...] The glue records are address records that provide IP addresses for ns1.example.org. The resolver uses {{one or more of}} these IP addresses to query one of the domain's authoritative servers, which allows it to complete the DNS query.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to its {{merging with}} macOS, the server edition macOS Server was architecturally {{identical}} to its desktop counterpart and usually ran on Apple's line of Macintosh server hardware. macOS Server included work group management and administration software tools that provide simplified access to key network services, including a mail transfer agent, a Samba server, an LDAP server, a domain <b>name</b> <b>server,</b> and others. With Mac OS X v10.7 Lion, all server aspects of Mac OS X Server have been {{integrated into the}} client version and the product re-branded as [...] "OS X" [...] (dropping [...] "Mac" [...] from the name). The server tools are now offered as an application.|$|E
30|$|Networks could {{establish}} trustworthiness and correctness of the DNS responses, by querying the different <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> (and instances thereof), belonging to target domains. To query <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> instances distributed via an ANYCAST, the network could use proxies located {{in different parts}} of the Internet. The inconsistencies, if found, would be carefully checked to test for attacks.|$|R
50|$|For the non-validating stub {{resolver}} {{to place}} any real reliance on DNSSEC services, the stub resolver must trust both the recursive <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> in question (which is usually {{controlled by the}} Internet Service Provider) and the communication channels between itself and those <b>name</b> <b>servers,</b> using methods such as IPsec, SIG(0), or TSIG. The use of IPsec is not widespread.|$|R
