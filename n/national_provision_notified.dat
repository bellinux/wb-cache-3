40|$|Defence date: 26 April 2012 Examining Board: Professor Heike Schweitzer, Universität Mannheim and European University Institute (Supervisor) Professor Hans-Wolfgang Micklitz, European University Institute Professor Lorenzo F. Pace, Università degli Studi del Molise Professor Harm Schepel, Kent Law SchoolThe {{enactment}} of Regulation 1 / 2003 radically {{changed the rules}} for the application of Art. 101 and Art. 102 TFEU, replacing the existing system of prior administrative authorisation by one of a directly applicable exception coupled with the possibility of national authorities applying Art. 101 (3) TFEU. Concerns over substantial consistency in the application of European competition law (“ECL”) were the main reason for the introduction of the so-called rule of convergence under Art. 3 of Regulation 1 / 2003. Although Art. 3 expanded and gave statutory weight to the assertion of supremacy of ECL over national competition law (“NCL”), initially acknowledged in the Walt Wilhelm judgement, it did not rule out completely the possibility of Member States applying stricter NCL to unilateral conduct adopted by undertakings (Art. 3 (2) second sentence). Prima facie, the exception would cover <b>national</b> <b>provisions</b> prohibiting the abuse of economic dependence/superior bargaining power, resale below cost/at a loss, as well as some types of unilateral conduct not related to economic dependence (e. g. boycott). An inquiry into four selected jurisdictions (France, Germany, Italy and the UK) reveals that not all <b>national</b> <b>provisions</b> whose primary goal is “the protection of competition on the market” (Rec. 9 of Regulation 1 / 2003) should be taken as a legitimate manifestation of plurality compatible with the concerns over substantive consistency mirrored in Art. 3 (2) second sentence. The primary reason for this selective approach is that some <b>national</b> <b>provisions,</b> in particular those that prohibit per se resale below cost/at a loss, want a valid economic rationale for the purpose of competition law. Conversely, other stricter <b>national</b> <b>provisions</b> may be regarded as performing a complementary role vis-à-vis ECL, as it may be the case of the prohibition of economic dependence applied to the automotive and food-supply sectors. Despite the substantial changes introduced by Art. 3 in the relationship between ECL and NCL, Art. 3 (2) second sentence can be regarded as a continuation of the case law inaugurated by the Walt Wilhelm judgement, recognising, albeit in more limited terms, that “unitas in diversitate” is an integrating part of competition law...|$|R

50|$|The Directive {{requires}} all Member States {{to apply}} effective, dissuasive and proportionate remedies and penalties against those engaged in counterfeiting and piracy.

In short, the Directive adds extra measures on enforcement of digital copyright while leaving national law in other areas unaffected.|$|R
40|$|Property {{rights of}} {{copyright}} (economic copyright) Abstract Intellectual Property Law as {{a branch of}} Private Law comprises two categories of rights - {{industrial property and copyright}} in a broader sense. In my thesis I focus on that part of Copyright Law which deals with rights to the author's work (i. e. copyright in the strict sense), specifically property rights of copyright (economic copyright). This thesis therefore provides a comprehensive explanation of property rights, which would not be possible without a brief explanation of the subject, development, concept and content of copyright. I also pay attention to legal regulation of the license agreement, which is a separate type of contract under the Copyright Act. Finally there is the collective management of copyright explained in my thesis. With respect to the importance of copyright which increases over time in response to the rapid development of information technologies, there is a need of its consistent protection and acceptance of more detailed and rigorous legislation. A numerous instruments of International Law and EU Law (whose main purpose is to harmonize <b>national</b> <b>provisions</b> of the Member States; the Czech Republic {{is a member of the}} European Union since 2004) therefore plays an important role in the harmonization of the <b>national</b> <b>provisions</b> [...] ...|$|R
