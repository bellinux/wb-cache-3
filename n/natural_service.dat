5|$|The best bulls go to {{artificial}} insemination (AI) cooperatives where semen is taken. AI allows the wide distribution of a bulls' genetics {{to the benefit}} of more farmers. However, in order to guarantee their genetic qualities, the bulls are subject to a strict selection scheme to increase the accuracy of the different genetic indexes. The best bulls identified at Lanaud are sent to another test station at Naves in Corr√®ze. Here they are tested more accurately and evaluated for feed conversion efficiency, growth and muscle development. Progeny of the top 10 bulls out of this testing, and the best <b>natural</b> <b>service</b> bulls, are then evaluated. Cows are inseminated to produce 60 to 80 calves per bull tested, which are in turn evaluated.|$|E

The Lady Joanna, as every one now called her, took it as only the bounden duty and <b>natural</b> <b>service</b> {{of one of her}} suite, and would have cared little for his suffering for it personally, except so far as it concerned her own dignity, which she understood much better than she had done in Scotland, where she was only one of 'the lassies,' an encumbrance to every one.|$|E
40|$|Main goal of {{this paper}} is to present a {{specific}} aspect of a recently designed ecological input-output model (ecolio) that on the one hand adopts the traditional monetary flows and that on the other hand transfers ecological relevant physical flows into the monetary scheme. Therefore the provision of natural resources and the absorption of emissions are evaluated in monetary terms. The model suggests, based on a detailed literature review, separate price corridors for each category of resources and emissions. ?ecolio? considers ?Nature? as intermediate sector that provides resources and absorption services as (monetarized) inputs for the conventional intermediate sectors. Since the usage of the considered <b>natural</b> <b>services</b> is currently ?gratis' for the industries, the companies have no incentive to replace resource intensive by nature friendly production. Within this paper it is assumed that the usage of <b>natural</b> <b>services</b> is not free of charge for the industries anymore, which in turn affects the input-output analysis at least twice. Since ?Nature? is considered as intermediate sector, first the Leontief output multipliers will change significantly. Generally the output multiplier become the higher the more <b>natural</b> <b>services</b> are absorbed, i. e. nature-intensive production is ?rewarded? by growing output multipliers. With regard to the concept of a sustainable development, the often positive assessment of high output multipliers is questioned in this paper. In contrast, if two sectors show similar income multipliers (based on the Leontief inverse matrix and the income coefficients) and different output multipliers, the sector with the smaller output multiplier will fulfill the idea of a sustainable development in a more efficient way. Secondly the pricing of <b>natural</b> <b>services</b> will, in the medium term, also lead to changing input coefficients, the paper closes with a brief outline of an exemplary substitution process that could be initiated by the evaluation of <b>natural</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R

6000|$|Looking {{around to}} find just where the <b>natural</b> <b>service</b> of the House of Commons comes in, I am {{inclined}} {{to think that it}} must be in the practice of [...] "asking questions" [...] in the House. Whenever anything goes wrong a member rises and asks a question. He gets up, for example, with a little paper in his hand, and asks the government if ministers are aware that the Khedive of Egypt was seen yesterday wearing a Turkish Tarbosh. Ministers say very humbly that they hadn't known it, and a thrill runs through the whole country. The members can apparently ask any questions they like. In the repeated visits which I made to the gallery of the House of Commons I was unable to find any particular sense or meaning in the questions asked, though no doubt they had an intimate bearing on English politics not clear to an outsider like myself. I heard one member ask the government whether they were aware that herrings were being imported from Hamburg to Harwich. The government said no. Another member rose and asked the government whether they considered Shakespere or Moliere the greater dramatic artist. The government answered that ministers were taking this under their earnest consideration and that a report would be submitted to Parliament. Another member asked the government if they knew who won the Queen's Plate this season at Toronto. They did,--in fact this member got in wrong, as this is the very thing that the government do know. Towards the close of the evening a member rose and asked the government if they knew what time it was. The Speaker, however, ruled this question out of order on the ground that it had been answered before.|$|E
60|$|The French Church {{was called}} on {{to provide for the}} other two children. The daughter, Alice, became a nun in one of the Parisian convents, with {{promises}} of promotion. The younger son, Phelim, was weakly in health, and of intellect feeble, if not deficient, and was almost dependent on the devoted care and tenderness of his foster-brother, Laurence Callaghan. Nobody was startled when Berwick's interest procured for the dull boy of ten years old the Abbey of St. Eudoce in Champagne. To be sure the responsibilities were not great, for the Abbey had been burnt down {{a century and a half}} ago by the Huguenots, and there had never been any monks in it since, so the only effect was that little Phelim Burke went by the imposing title of Monsieur l'Abbe de St. Eudoce, and his family enjoyed as much of the revenues of the estates of the Abbey as the Intendant thought proper to transmit to them. He was, to a certain degree, ecclesiastically educated, having just memory enough to retain for recitation the tasks that Lanty helped him to learn, and he could copy the themes or translations made for him by his faithful companion. Neither boy had the least notion of unfairness or deception in this arrangement: it was only the <b>natural</b> <b>service</b> of the one to the other, and if it were perceived in the Fathers of the Seminary, whither Lanty daily conducted the young Abbot, they winked at it. Nor, though the quick-witted Lanty thus acquired a considerable amount of learning, no idea occurred to him of availing himself of it for his own advantage. It sat outside him, as it were, for 'Masther Phelim's' use; and he no more thought of applying it to his own elevation than he did of wearing the soutane he brushed for his young master.|$|E
6000|$|As to the method, {{what can}} be said as yet except that {{where there is a}} will, there is a way? If there be no will, we are lost. That is a {{possibility}} for our crazy little empire, if not for the universe; and as such possibilities are not to be entertained without despair, we must, whilst we survive, proceed on the assumption that we have still energy enough to not only will to live, but to will to live better. That may mean that we must establish a State Department of Evolution, with a seat in the Cabinet for its chief, and a revenue to defray the cost of direct State experiments, and provide inducements to private persons to achieve successful results. It may mean a private society or a chartered company for the improvement of human live stock. But for the present it is far more likely to mean a blatant repudiation of such proposals as indecent and immoral, with, nevertheless, a general secret pushing of the human will in the repudiated direction; so that all sorts of institutions and public authorities will under some pretext or other feel their way furtively towards the Superman. Mr Graham Wallas has already ventured to suggest, as Chairman of the School Management Committee of the London School Board, that the accepted policy of the Sterilization of the Schoolmistress, however administratively convenient, is open to criticism from the national stock-breeding point of view; and this is as good an example as any {{of the way in which}} the drift towards the Superman may operate in spite of all our hypocrisies. One thing at least is clear to begin with. If a woman can, by careful selection of a father, and nourishment of herself, produce a citizen with efficient senses, sound organs, and a good digestion, she should clearly be secured a sufficient reward for that <b>natural</b> <b>service</b> to make her willing to undertake and repeat it. Whether she be financed in the undertaking by herself, or by the father, or by a speculative capitalist, or by a new department of, say, the Royal Dublin Society, or (as at present) by the War Office maintaining her [...] "on the strength" [...] and authorizing a particular soldier to marry her, or by a local authority under a by-law directing that women may under certain circumstances have a year's leave of absence on full salary, or by the central government, does not matter provided the result be satisfactory.|$|E

50|$|Cattle {{have been}} found to be {{infected}} either by the respiratory or the vaginal route (iatrogenic cases disregarded). Primary infection of mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract is associated with head pruritus, while lung infection results in chest pruritus. Vaginal infection of bovines, which regularly show pruritus of the hindquarters, has been found to be associated with a concurrent genital infection in swine on the same premises, and investigations have evidenced that the vaginal infection of cattle had been sexually transmitted by man from genitally infected sows (animal sodomy, zoophilia, bestiallity). Genital infection in swine herds has been closely correlated with the use of boars from boar centres for <b>natural</b> <b>service</b> of sows.|$|E

40|$|One {{aspect of}} reality that {{professional}} {{social workers are}} experiencing {{in the course of}} performing social work is what the authors will refer to as <b>natural</b> <b>service</b> delivery systems. We use this particular term for clarity, yet there are questions that still remain. Are there, in fact, measurable phenomena that we can call <b>natural</b> <b>service</b> delivery systems? If these systems exist, what kind of services do they deliver or what types of services do they imply? If these services do exist and if we recognize them, what are the implications for professional social workers? How does our knowledge base allow for us to intervene in these systems with minimal danger of destroying or changing their character and still use them as resources? These questions arose after both authors had worked within communities where, because, of the nature and composition of the populations, it was apparent that natural services were being provided by one neighbor to another or by one friend to another. It was difficult to explain those services in relation to our own roles as social workers. Often it seemed as if there was in existence a procedure that we did not understand in terms of a worker-client relationship.
