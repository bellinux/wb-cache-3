We exploit a reform that introduced substantial reduction in these two provisions for unemployed workers aged less than thirty and over forty five years.

Difference-in-differences estimates, which account for the endogeneity of the treatment status, suggest that decreased firing costs and payroll taxes have a positive overall short-term effect on wages – and also on unemployment.

40|$|<b>Non-wage</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> are {{relatively}} high in Austria. This is due, above all, {{to the level}} of employer contributions to social security, payroll-dependent charges, and the extent of non-productive times. If – in the interest of logical coherence – bonus payments (13 th and 14 th monthly salaries) are added to base pay, the rate of <b>non-wage</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> amounts to 61. 4 percent of the hourly wage. Relative to the yearly income (corrected for non-productive times), <b>non-wage</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> (social charges) account for approximately one third of total labour costs. If the anticipated surpluses of the existing funds in the field of social security are used to reduce contributions rather than increase spending, there ought to be some scope for a lowering of <b>non-wage</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> in the years to come. This applies, in particular, to contributions to the family relief fund, the fund to secure wage and salary payments in the event of insolvency, accident insurance, subsidised housing construction, and – in view of the expected economic upswing – unemployment insurance. Reducing non-productive times is yet another way to lower <b>non-wage</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs.</b> If all possibilities to reduce contributions are fully utilised in the coming years, <b>non-wage</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> can be cut by up to ATS 16 billion. In addition, the related reduction of employees' contributions by up to ATS 6 billion would not only result in higher net wages and stronger consumer demand, but also have a moderating effect on the increase of gross wages. However, a reduction of contributions requires a departure from the past practice of using potential surpluses to increase spending and/or transfer payments or redistributing them to the old-age pension system – which in turn limits the scope for budget consolidation. Moreover, the margin available for reductions of contributions cannot be fully utilised, unless appropriate reforms are implemented {{at the same time to}} take account of the changing priorities of economic and social policy. Reducing contributions has the added benefit of imposing a more stringent spending discipline, whereas surpluses from earmarked revenues tend to generate further expenditure increases. The effects of a reduction of <b>non-wage</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> on the economy and the labour market have been calculated on the basis of the WIFO macro-model: • The impact largely depends on whether and to what extent enterprises are willing to pass on the reduction of <b>non-wage</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> in the form of lower prices, which in turn would have a moderating effect on collective bargaining agreements. If the entire ATS 16 billion margin is used to lower <b>non-wage</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> and enterprises partly adjust their prices accordingly (as assumed in the model), this will translate into a growth of real GDP by 0. 3 percent and an increase in the number of persons in employment by 6, 400 (over baseline) after no more than two years. These effects continue to increase in subsequent years. • If the reduction of <b>non-wage</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> were passed on fully to prices, the effect would be about twice as strong: after two years, real GDP would be about 0. 7 percent higher, and the number of jobs would increase by 12, 300. The faster the cost reduction is passed on to buyers in Austria and abroad, the more favourable the effects on economic growth and employment.

It begins by examining the concept of unit wage costs, describing what the series aims to measure and explaining some of the conceptual difficulties when estimating data in practice. The first issue concerns the series used to measure the <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> of employees; wages and salaries are currently used instead of the more comprehensive compensation of employees (CoE) series. Secondly, the <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> of the self-employed are not satisfactorily estimated by the current method.

40|$|Austria {{currently}} takes 11 th {{place in}} an international ranking of unit labour costs. Labour is most expensive in Norway, Germany and Switzerland, where one hour of manufacturing labour costs almost a quarter more than in Austria. In Austrian manufacturing, one hour of work cost € 20. 31 in 2001, which was about 4 {{percent higher than the}} EU average. The amount was composed of wages costing € 10. 65 and <b>non-wage</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> of € 9. 66. With this, <b>non-wage</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> made up 90. 7 percent. In spite of a cut in the contribution by employers to the health insurance scheme for blue-colour workers, it was 0. 8 percentage points higher than in 2000, since severance payments, after declining substantially in 2000, were once again on the rise. <b>Non-wage</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> in Austria are high because {{a large portion of the}} annual income is in the form of tax-privileged bonus payments (13 th and 14 th monthly salaries). If these bonus payments were counted as fixed parts of the wage or salary, <b>non-wage</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> would make up 63. 2 percent for manufacturing. Austria's ranking in terms of unit labour costs changed several times over the course of the 1990 s. In the first half of the decade, Austrian industries lost ground due to considerable wage inflation and the schilling's upward revaluation due to the crisis in the European monetary system. After the mid- 1990 s, a better currency situation and lower wage inflation, with sustained high rates of productivity growth, markedly improved price competition: relative unit labour costs have since been declining on a uniform currency base against the average of trade partners, by well over 2. 5 percent p. a. Altogether, Austrian manufacturing has been able to improve its unit wage costs position by a good 10 percent since the early 1990 s. In 2001, the cost of an hour of work rose by 3. 5 percent; with productivity growth declining to + 1. 3 percent (as against + 7. 3 percent in 2000), unit wage costs in Austrian manufacturing went up by 2. 1 percent. With unit wage costs rising similarly in competing countries, Austria's relative ranking remained unchanged over the previous year.
