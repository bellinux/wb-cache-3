40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the implementation and operation of a pharmacovigilance program in the pharmaceutical industry in Brazil, taking as a tool a questionnaire with closed questions. The survey was carried out between {{the second quarter of}} 2009 and the first quarter of 2010. From 181 pharmaceutical companies that received the questionnaire, 7. 18 % did not answer, but reported {{that they did not have}} a pharmacovigilance program or said that it was confidential company information, 27. 62 % have contributed to the survey by answering the questions. Of these, 82 % said they already have a program of pharmacovigilance and 18 % said the program was under implementation. Moreover, companies considered small businesses represent the majority of which are in the deployment phase of their pharmacovigilance programs. Considering results and comparing with the number of <b>notifications</b> <b>received</b> <b>on</b> the reports from Sistema de Notificações em Vigilância Sanitária (Notifications System in Health Surveillance), it was observed that pharmaceutical companies represent a small portion when compared to hospitals and notifying pharmacies...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{an attempt}} to address a complex disease burden, {{including}} improving progress towards MDGs 4 and 5, South Africa recently introduced a re-engineered Primary Health Care (PHC) strategy, {{which has led to}} the development of a national community health worker (CHW) programme. The present study explored the development of a cell phone-based and paper-based monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system to support the work of the CHWs. METHODS: One sub-district in the North West province was identified for the evaluation. One outreach team comprising ten CHWs maintained both the paper forms and mHealth system to record household data on community-based services. A comparative analysis was done to calculate the correspondence between the paper and phone records. A focus group discussion was conducted with the CHWs. Clinical referrals, data accuracy and supervised visits were compared and analysed for the paper and phone systems. RESULTS: Compared to the mHealth system where data accuracy was assured, 40 % of the CHWs showed a consistently high level (> 90 % correspondence) of data transfer accuracy on paper. Overall, there was an improvement over time, and by the fifth month, all CHWs achieved a correspondence of 90 % or above between phone and paper data. The most common error that occurred was summing the total number of visits and/or activities across the five household activity indicators. Few supervised home visits were recorded in either system and there was no evidence of the team leader following up <b>on</b> the automatic <b>notifications</b> <b>received</b> <b>on</b> their cell phones. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation emphasizes the need for regular supervision for both systems and rigorous and ongoing assessments of data quality for the paper system. Formalization of a mHealth M&E system for PHC outreach teams delivering community based services could offer greater accuracy of M&E and enhance supervision systems for CHWs. Web of Scienc...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} the possible {{continued existence of}} a digital divide as it related to how residents in two disperse communities <b>received</b> <b>notification</b> of late season tornado events in 2013. The theoretical perspective of the Diffusion of Innovations, Knowledge Gap and Structuration theories were used to examine how <b>notifications</b> were <b>received</b> based <b>on</b> socioeconomic indicators of total household income and education affected the ability for respondents to be notified of the impending danger. Results varied for the communities surveyed, both supporting and negating how specific socioeconomic factors influence how respondents <b>received</b> <b>notifications</b> and the behavior they took after the message was received. Findings of the study indicate that higher total household income and higher education are often times associated with how respondents receive warnings of tornadoes in their area, but associations are not always consistent.

40|$|This is a {{paper that}} was {{submitted}} to the ECSA 2010 Conference ([URL] but was refused (<b>notification</b> was <b>received</b> <b>on</b> May 15, 2010). A Web service is a software functionality accessible through the network. Web services are intended to be composed to realize domain-specific applications. Achieving a required functionality by a service composition necessitates {{the discovery of a}} collection of Web services out of the enormous service space. Each service from this service space must be examined to verify its functionality, which makes the discovery task neither efficient nor practical. Moreover, when a service in a composition becomes unavailable or functionally broken, the whole composition may become broken too. Therefore, a functionally equivalent service must be discovered, in order to replace the broken service, thus spending more time and effort. In this paper, we propose an approach that facilitates the discovery of a web service and the identification of its candidate substitutes. We use many-valued concept lattices to classify web services, depending on the similarity estimated between their operations. This classification enables the identification of a needed web service as well as its possible alternatives. Thus, a Web service composition can be achieved more easily and can be supported with backup services, to recover the functionality of a broken service...|$|R

40|$|The {{algorithms}} in {{the current}} sequential numerical linear algebra libraries (e. g. LAPACK) do not parallelize well on multicore architectures. A new family of algorithms, the tile algorithms, has recently been introduced. Previous {{research has shown that}} it is possible to write efficient and scalable tile algorithms for performing a Cholesky factorization, a (pseudo) LU factorization, and a QR factorization. In this extended abstract, we attack the problem of the computation of the inverse of a symmetric positive definite matrix. We observe that, using a dynamic task scheduler, it is relatively painless to translate existing LAPACK code to obtain a ready-to-be-executed tile algorithm. However we demonstrate that non trivial compiler techniques (array renaming, loop reversal and pipelining) need then to be applied to further increase the parallelism of our application. We present preliminary experimental results. Comment: 8 pages, extended abstract submitted to VecPar 10 on 12 / 11 / 09, <b>notification</b> of acceptance <b>received</b> <b>on</b> 02 / 05 / 10.

Although the {{majority}} of <b>notifications</b> are <b>received</b> from Queensland, {{little is known about the}} distribution of the disease within the state, or the important mosquito vectors and nonhuman vertebrate hosts. We conducted a retrospective statistical analysis of the <b>notifications</b> <b>received</b> from Queensland residents from 1993 to 2003 to establish long-term local incidence rates and to identify disease outbreaks. In total, 4, 544 <b>notifications</b> were <b>received</b> over the 10 -yr period. Disease reporting peaked in autumn, although the peak transmission season encompassed both summer and autumn. Long-term standardized incidence rates for summer/autumn and winter/spring varied across the state, showing positive spatial autocorrelation in both 6 -mo periods. Although 15 instances of increased disease activity were identified, only one major disease outbreak affecting eight contiguous local government areas was detected in summer/autumn 2002 / 2003. This outbreak contained 297 cases, 115 more than would be expected over this period. The factors important to this outbreak are unknown and require further investigation. Although the incidence rates for BFV disease are lower than Ross River virus disease, the most reported mosquito-borne disease in Australia, several factors indicate that this virus should be considered an important public health risk in Queensland. These include consistent endemic transmission, apparent underreporting of the disease, and the potential for outbreaks in major population centers...|$|R
