5000|$|In the 1950s, the {{widespread}} popularity of Cerophyl started to wane {{with the introduction}} of One-A-Day Vitamins. It was an era that lauded [...] "the miracles of modern science." [...] People reasoned that it was better to take one tablet of synthetic vitamins per day than to obtain their vitamins from a natural source by taking twenty Cerophyl tablets. Although the first use of Cerophyl for both human and animal consumption occurred in August 1937, it was not trademarked years later. The popularity of Cerophyl gave way to synthetic vitamins that people thought were better and more convenient. Schnabel developed a version of Cerophyl, fortified with synthetic vitamins, so the consumer could reduce the daily requirement from twenty tablets to four, but this second product had limited success. Although Cerophyl continued to be sold on a limited basis, it was not until 1976 that the use of cereal grass as a human food began to increase again. He also tested cereal grass at every stage of growth and determined the highest level of nutrition was achieved just prior to and at the jointing stage. He developed a dehydration method that captured that high <b>nutritional</b> <b>level.</b> His research led directly to dozens of dehydration facilities in every state where cereal grains and alfalfa are grown.

40|$|This {{research}} examines which neural mechanisms {{among the}} endogenous opioid, dopaminergic, serotonergic and excitatory amino acid systems {{are involved in}} the stimulation of LH secretion by melatonin implantation and their modulation by <b>nutritional</b> <b>level.</b> Female goats were distributed to two experimental groups that received either 1. 1 (group H; n= 24) or 0. 7 (group L; n= 24) times their nutritional maintenance requirements. Half of each group was implanted with melatonin after a long-day period. Plasma LH concentrations were measured twice per week. The effects of i. v. injections of naloxone, pimozide, cyproheptadine and N-methyl-d,l-aspartate (NMDA) on LH secretion were assessed the day before melatonin implantation and again on days 30 and 45. The functioning of all but the dopaminergic systems was clearly modified by the level of nutrition, melatonin implantation and time elapsed since implantation. Thirty days after implantation, naloxone increased LH concentrations irrespective of the level of nutrition (P< 0. 05), similar to NMDA in the melatonin-implanted H goats (HM; P< 0. 01). On day 45, naloxone increased LH concentrations in the HM animals (P< 0. 05), similar to cyproheptadine in both the non-implanted H (HC) and the HM animals (P< 0. 01). Finally, at 45 days, NMDA increased the LH concentration in all subgroups (P< 0. 01). These results provide evidence that the effects of different neural systems on LH secretion are modified by <b>nutritional</b> <b>level</b> and melatonin implantation. Endogenous opioids seem to be most strongly involved in the inhibition of LH secretion on days 30 and 45 after melatonin implantation.

The reduction of the <b>nutritional</b> <b>levels</b> harmed the performance of the birds, particularly egg production and egg mass, which improved by the inclusion of phytase in the diets.

40|$|The {{olive tree}} is {{generally}} characterized by relatively low final fruit set consequential {{to a significant}} rate of undeveloped pistils, pistil abortion, and flower and fruitlet abscission.

To study the role of phosphorus (P) <b>nutritional</b> <b>level</b> on reproductive development, trees were grown under four levels of P for three years in large containers. Phosphorus <b>nutritional</b> <b>level</b> {{was positively related to}} rate of reproductive bud break, inflorescence weight, rate of hermaphrodite flowers, pistil weight, fruitlet persistence, fruit set and the consequential total number of fruits. The positive impact of P nutrition on the productivity parameters was not related to carbohydrate reserves or to carbohydrate transport to the developing inflorescence. Phosphorous deficient trees showed significant impairment of assimilation rate, and yet, carbohydrates were accumulated in inflorescences at levels comparable to or higher than trees receiving high P. In contrast to female reproductive organs, pollen viability was consistently higher in P deficient trees, possibly due to the enhanced carbohydrate availability. Overall, the positive effect of P on female reproductive development was found to be independent of the total carbohydrate availability. Hence, P is speculated to have a direct influence on reproductive processes...|$|E
