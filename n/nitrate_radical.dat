Using computational methods, we suggest that bond scission of the nitrooxy alkoxy radicals from Delta(3) -carene lead to the formation of reactive keto-nitrooxy-alkyl radicals, which retain the nitrooxy moiety and can undergo further reactions to form SOA. By contrast, bond scissions of the nitrooxy alkoxy radicals from alpha-pinene lead almost exclusively to the formation of the relatively unreactive and volatile product pinonaldehyde (C 10 H 16 O 2), thereby limiting organonitrate and SOA formation.

The knowledge today is very limited on how atmospheric processing affects the toxicological properties of the emissions. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the influence of ozone initiated (dark) atmospheric processing on the physicochemical and toxicological properties of particulate emissions from wood combustion. Emissions from a conventional wood stove operated at two combustion conditions (nominal and hot air starved) were diluted and transferred to a chamber. Particulate matter (PM) was collected before and after ozone addition to the chamber using an impactor. Detailed chemical and physical characterization was performed on chamber air and collected PM. The collected PM was investigated toxicologically in vitro with a mouse macrophage model, endpoints included: cell cycle analysis, viability, inflammation and genotoxicity. The results suggest that changes in the organic fraction, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are the main driver for differences in obtained toxicological effects. Fresh hot air starved emissions containing a higher organic and PAH mass-fraction affected cell viability stronger than fresh emissions from nominal combustion. The PAH mass fractions decreased upon aging due to chemical degradation. Dark aging increased genotoxicity, reduced viability and reduced release of inflammatory markers. These differences were statistically significant for single doses and typically less pronounced.

For an initial isoprene concentration of 18. 4 to 101. 6 ppb, the SOA yield (defined as the ratio of the mass of organic aerosol formed to the mass of parent hydrocarbon reacted) ranges from 4. 3 % to 23. 8 %.

Absorption spectra of dilute samples (50 – 500 parts per trillion) of the <b>nitrate</b> <b>radical,</b> NO 3, have been obtained between 650 and 670 nm by monitoring simultaneously the time and wavelength resolved output of a ringdown cavity. The potential of broadband CRDS for making measurements on samples containing multiple absorbers (e. g., atmospheric samples) is shown by applying analysis methods from {{differential optical absorption spectroscopy}} to quantify the NO 3 concentration in the presence of nitrogen dioxide impurities...|$|E

We performed kinetic experiments at room temperature and atmospheric pressure using a relative-rate technique with GC-FID analysis. The experimental results demonstrate a surprisingly large cis-trans (Z-E) effect, {{particularly in the case}} of the pent- 2 -enes, where the ratio of rate coefficients is ca. 1. 7. Rate coefficients are discussed in terms of electronic and steric influences, and our results give some insight into the effects of chain length and position of the double bond on the reaction of NO 3 with unsaturated hydrocarbons. Atmospheric lifetimes were calculated with respect to important oxidants in the troposphere for the alkenes studied, and NO 3 -initiated oxidation is found to be the dominant degradation route for (Z) -pent- 2 -ene, (Z) -hex- 3 -ene and (E) - 3 -methylpent- 2 -ene...|$|R
40|$|Alkyl nitrates and {{secondary}} organic aerosol (SOA) produced during the oxidation of isoprene by <b>nitrate</b> <b>radicals</b> {{has been observed}} in the SAPHIR (Simulation of Atmospheric PHotochemistry In a large Reaction Chamber) chamber. A 16 h dark experiment was conducted with temperatures at 289 – 301 K, and maximum concentrations of 11 ppb isoprene, 62. 4 ppb O 3 and 31. 1 ppb NO x. We find the yield of nitrates is 70 ± 8 % from the isoprene + NO 3 reaction, and the yield for secondary dinitrates produced in the reaction of primary isoprene nitrates with NO 3 is 40 ± 20 %. We find an effective rate constant for reaction of NO 3 with the group of first generation oxidation products to be 7 × 10 − 14 molecule − 1 cm 3 s − 1. At the low total organic aerosol concentration in the chamber (max= 0. 52 μg m − 3) we observed a mass yield (ΔSOA mass/Δisoprene mass) of 2 % for the entire 16 h experiment. However {{a comparison of the}} timing of the observed SOA production to a box model simulation of first and second generation oxidation products shows that the yield from the first generation products was < 0. 7 % while the further oxidation of the initial products leads to a yield of 14 % (defined as ΔSOA/Δisoprene 2 x where Δisoprene 2 x is the mass of isoprene which reacted twice with NO 3). The SOA yield of 14 % is consistent with equilibrium partitioning of highly functionalized C 5 products of isoprene oxidation...|$|R
40|$|Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) {{formation}} {{from the}} reaction of isoprene with <b>nitrate</b> <b>radicals</b> (NO 3) is investigated in the Caltech indoor chambers. Experiments are performed {{in the dark and}} under dry conditions (RH 2 O 5 as a source of NO 3 radicals. For an initial isoprene concentration of 18. 4 to 101. 6 ppb, the SOA yield (defined as the ratio of the mass of organic aerosol formed to the mass of parent hydrocarbon reacted) ranges from 4. 3 % to 23. 8 %. By examining the time evolutions of gas-phase intermediate products and aerosol volume in real time, we are able to constrain the chemistry that leads to the formation of low-volatility products. Although the formation of ROOR from {{the reaction of}} two peroxy radicals (RO 2) has generally been considered as a minor channel, based on the gas-phase and aerosol-phase data it appears that RO 2 +RO 2 reaction (self reaction or cross-reaction) in the gas phase yielding ROOR products is a dominant SOA formation pathway. A wide array of organic nitrates and peroxides are identified in the aerosol formed and mechanisms for SOA formation are proposed. Using a uniform SOA yield of 10 % (corresponding to M o ≅ 10 μg m − 3), it is estimated that ~ 2 to 3 Tg yr − 1 of SOA results from isoprene + NO 3. The extent to which the results from this study can be applied to conditions in the atmosphere depends on the fate of peroxy radicals (i. e. the relative importance of RO 2 +RO 2 versus RO 2 +NO 3 reactions) in the nighttime troposphere...|$|R
