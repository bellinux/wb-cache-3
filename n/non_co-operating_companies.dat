40|$|The {{ways to do}} {{business}} are changing and relationships are becoming more important. One big change in relationship marketing is that <b>companies</b> are <b>co-operating</b> in many different ways. These different forms of co-operation {{have been a big}} part of this research since the theories are not consistent and business people do not have a clear picture of what concept of co- operation they are working with. The {{purpose of this study is}} to reach an understanding of how co-operation between selling companies can deliver added value to the customer. TeliaSonera’s personnel were interviewed and the literature was studied to get an understanding of how co-operations work. There were no theories about the customers’ experiences of selling companies in co-operation, bet there were some theories about how co-operations shall work between the co- operating companies to be successful. Because of the lack of relevant theories and since the studied co-operations are delivering services, are the theories that are brought up in this research from the service marketing and service production. Customers were identified and interviewed according to their earlier experiences of buying from <b>co-operating</b> <b>companies.</b> The service production theories and the success factors were used in analysing the interview results. The analysis gave some clear results that the customers identified as values that companies can deliver to them through co-operation. The customers want the companies to communicate their co-operation so that they can see the value. The customers also identified the success factors (summarised in table 7. 1), from the theory, and if the co-operation follows those factors the customer will feel secure. If the <b>co-operating</b> <b>companies</b> have an understanding of the customer’s line of business it can make the customer gain trust. Gathering the right competences can make the customer get a whole solution and save them time and money. If the co-operation adjusts the level of involvement for the customer according to the complexity of the problem the customers will get the most of the buy. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|Abstract ♣ Nowadays, many {{organizations}} form dynamic partnerships to {{deal effectively with}} market requirements. As companies use automated workflow systems to control their processes, a way of linking workflow processes in different organizations is useful in turning the <b>co-operating</b> <b>companies</b> into a seamless operating virtual enterprise. The CrossFlow Esprit project aims at developing information technology for advanced process support in dynamic virtual organizations with contract based service trading. Contracts are necessary for flexible service outsourcing. This report presents contracts as a way of finding suitable partners, connect WFMSs of different kinds, control outsourced workflow, and share an abstraction of the workflow specification between the partners. The contract defines the data, process, and conditions relevant to the co-operation and the outsourced workflow on an abstract level. This information can be fed through an interface to the WFMSs {{on both sides of the}} outsourcing in order to automate fully the co-operation between the partners...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Web-based information system, called WebDia, {{which is designed}} to assist customers with such heating problems. WebDia is a prototype system, constructed for district heating substations and oil heating systems. WebDia incorporates a Web server integrated with a back-end database, accessible from a browser of a PC, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) or a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) mobile phone. The general idea behind the development is that the server computer shares its resources and knowledge with the user. Besides fault diagnosis, instructions for servicing and operating the heating system are also essential topics. The information content is gathered from various publications, material provided by manufacturers and interviews with experts. A great deal of the professional information also comes from the fourteen <b>co-operating</b> <b>companies</b> assisting in the system development. WebDia is a collection of dynamic HyperText Markup Language (HTML) pages, but it also includes pictures, photographs, video and audio recordings, and animations.

40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) {{has been}} used to study the (010) face of potassium hydrogen phthalate (KAP) crystals grown from aqueous solution. In order to achieve the necessary level of surface protection during removal from solution a novel protection method was developed. The surface was withdrawn from solution through a jet of compressed air. In {{order to be able to}} make the link between the defect structure of the crystal and the growth interface a detailed X-ray topographical analysis was performed. This showed the crystals to be of very low defect density. Furthermore the only dislocation observed in the (010) sector able to produce a step on the surface was characterised as having the Burgers vector. Two growth mechanisms were observed to operate on the (010) face of KAP crystals studied using AFM. On most crystals, a spiral growth mechanism was observed. On a minority of crystals a two dimensional nucleation and growth mechanism occurred at the higher range of supersaturations (above 15 %). In the case of a spiral mechanism it was generally noted that growth hillocks were dominated by a small number of <b>non</b> <b>co-operating</b> spiral sources. The spirals were all observed to be anisotropic and polygonised. The degree of polygonisation was found to vary as a function of supersaturation. The step spacing was found to have an inverse relation with the supersaturation, as predicted theoretically. From an inverse plot of step spacing against supersaturation it was possible to calculate the step edge free energies of both the fast and slower moving steps. These were 40 erg/cm" 2 and 8 erg/cm" 2 respectively.

Radhakrishan and other small {{transport}} operators got held {{up on the other}} side of the border. The foremost challenge that the State of Jammu and Kashmir faced was the availability of essential commodities. The handful of private transporters did not come forward to meet the challenge. Their vehicles had to be commandeered to bring refugees from border areas but they did not co-operate with the State’s Emergency Administration. The <b>non</b> <b>co-operating</b> transporters were even jailed. The Government addressed the issue of development of road transport immediately after assuming office which led to the birth of the first-ever Government owned transport fleet on June, Ist 1948. A handful of persons were drawn virtually from the road-side both at Jammu and Srinagar to form the management to operate the 50 trucks it acquired from General Motor Corporation, Bombay along with some accessories left by the American Company.The Organisation was run as a government department in the early stages. Later it was named as Government Transport Undertaking. The J&K State Road Transport Corporation (a successor to the erstwhile Government Transport Undertaking [...] ) came into existence on 1.9.1976 under Road Transport Corporation Act of 1950. The J&K SRTC has played a vital role in developing the economy of the State right from the date of its inception.

40|$|Increasing {{number of}} {{bankruptcy}} announcements means that even greater attention {{is being paid}} to the correct evaluation of the probability of default (PD) and decisions {{made on the basis}} of it. Reli-able estimation of the likelihood of a company’s bankruptcy reduces risk, not only for the company itself but also for all <b>co-operating</b> <b>companies</b> and financial institutions. The financial crisis has led to a tightening up of the conditions for gaining finance from banks. However, it is not only the evalua-tion of PD itself that is so important but also the correct classification of companies according to their PD level (“good ” or “bad ” companies). There is very little consideration about possible adjustments of the credit risk scale, as usually the American scale is adopted with no changes which seems incor-rect. This paper stresses the importance of correct calibration of the credit rating scale. It should not be assumed (as it was in the past) that once a scale is defined it remains fixed and independent of the country. Therefore, the research carried out on Polish companies shows that the credit rating scale should be changed and the default point (i. e. “cut-off ” point) should be higher than in the past. The author uses a modified classification matrix based on the probability of default. The paper compares the classification of quoted Polish companies according to their credit risk level (PD) with the actual occurrence of default when various default “cut-off ” points are used.

Commitment and loyalty are constructs known to be influenced by reputation, and likewise to influence citizenship behaviours. One of the objectives was to confirm their status. The focal point of the study was to expand the model to include customers’ identification with the company. Generic citizenship behaviours and word of mouth intentions were measured as outcomes. Trust was also tested as moderator for reputation-commitment and reputation-identification connections. The study was constructed as a quantitative survey set into online fashion retail context. The data acquisition was executed over approximately two weeks and resulted in 211 valid responses from Facebook followers of the <b>co-operating</b> <b>company.</b> The analysis was carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics and AMOS; structural equation modelling was used to test the viability of the model and hypotheses. The results were partly in accord with the previous literature. Factors measuring commitment and trust were removed from the model due to validity issues, thus remaining untested. Reputation had significant influence on loyalty and identification, as well as both outcome variables. These were as literature suggested. Loyalty notably influenced word of mouth intentions, but not citizenship behaviours. Identification in turn influenced citizenship behaviours, but not word of mouth intentions.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of an intelligent inventory management system. The aim of the system is to bridge the substantial gap between the theory and the practice of inventory management and to help industrial inventory managers to achieve an effective and successful inventory management. The proposed system attempts to achieve this by providing automatic pattern identification and model selection facilities. Such a hybrid knowledge-based inventory system consists of a collection of techniques (or pattern identifier) for identifying demand and lead time patterns and a knowledge base (or rule base) for subsequent selection of a suitable inventory model taking into consideration aspects of the practical situation. There are no previous attempts in the inventory literature to develop such a system to guide model selection. In order to integrate the system into the established computer-based intelligent inventory management system and facilitate the function of the pattern identifier, a data manager has been developed to manipulate the history data required for statistical analysis and to load the data into the system from other applications. In order to establish the system's model base, the study of the modelling of inventory and the features and evolution of expert systems are reviewed. The published models which deal with similar inventory problems have been compared based on its applicability, clarity, and being suitable to be computerised. It was necessary to further develop and amend published models to fill gaps in the model base. The overall structure and salient features of the proposed system and the development of the system using Visual Basic have been described. The system has been tested using real life data supplied by the <b>co-operating</b> <b>companies.</b> Finally, achievements and shortcomings of the system are discussed and some suggestions for further research are outlined...|$|R

40|$|In {{addition}} to giving {{a boost to}} foreign trade and foreign direct investment, {{the opening of the}} borders to the Central and Eastern European countries has also intensified links between companies which cannot be subsumed under the strictly separate categories of market-mediated and hierarchical co-ordination. Such co-operations usually have the Austrian company as the leading partner, indicated either by differences in size or the ownership structure. Most of these relationships found are of the majority or minority stakeholding type, and Austrian companies are typically larger than their partners in the CEECs. For a company survey performed by WIFO, {{more than a third of}} the businesses polled stated that they were co-operating with firms in the CEECs. The rate of co-operation depends very much on the firm size. Larger <b>companies</b> <b>co-operate</b> more frequently than smaller ones. Co-operation mostly concerns distribution or production, whereas R&D co-operation is quite negligible. Intra-industrial co-operation is the preferred option. Contrary to expectations that it was mostly near-border companies who had entered into co-operation schemes, it is actually the more remote companies who play the lead. More than half of all co-operating businesses in Austria have their domicile more than 50 km away from a CEEC border, and their respective partners in turn are more than 100 km away from their side of the border. Even CEEC firms within proximity of the border usually <b>co-operate</b> with Austrian <b>companies</b> situated more than 50 km away from the next CEEC border. But even firms in the Austrian border region mostly <b>co-operate</b> with CEEC <b>companies</b> located at a distance of more than 100 km from the Austrian border. From the surveyed companies' point of view, soft activities to promote co-operation (such as information centres) would be just as effective as financial promotion. This applies even more to companies that have not yet entered any co-operative venture. They rank information centres top among key activities.
