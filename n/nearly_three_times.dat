5|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century the kelp {{industry}} provided significant employment on some of the Orkney islands, but when the market collapsed between 1830 and 1832 it caused considerable hardship. North Ronaldsay was especially hard-hit and several families were allowed to resettle from there to develop land at Westside on Eday. Rising populations meant increasing land values, especially for small tenancies. In 1843 crofts were valued at £1/acre on Eday, <b>nearly</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> the price for larger farms. However, the 20th century saw decline. Immigration from mainland Scotland was essentially unknown even in the late 1950s and the population in 2001 was about an eighth of the total 160 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids {{and their}} closer neighbours mostly {{cost less than}} silver; only polonium and astatine are more expensive than gold, on account of their significant radioactivity. As of 5 April 2014, prices for small samples (up to 100 g) of silicon, antimony and tellurium, and graphite, aluminium and selenium, average around one third the cost of silver (US$1.5 per gram or about $45 an ounce). Boron, germanium and arsenic samples average about three-and-a-half times the cost of silver. Polonium is available for about $100 per microgram. Zalutsky and Pruszynski estimate a similar cost for producing astatine. Prices for the applicable elements traded as commodities tend to range from two to <b>three</b> <b>times</b> cheaper than the sample price (Ge), to <b>nearly</b> <b>three</b> thousand <b>times</b> cheaper (As).|$|R

25|$|Stars at {{the centre}} of the Milky Way are so densely packed that special imaging {{techniques}} (such as adaptive optics) were needed to boost the resolution of the VLT.

40|$|Abstract—Code Completion {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular IDE {{features}} for accessing APIs, freeing programmers from remembering specific details about an API and reducing keystrokes. We propose three ways to enhance the current code-completion systems to work more effectively with large APIs. First, we propose two methods for sorting APIs, by type hierarchy and by use count, and show that their use significantly reduces the number of API proposals a user must navigate while using Code Completion. Second, we show that context-specific filtering of inappropriate proposals can also reduce the number of proposals a user must navigate. Third, we propose to group API proposals by their functional roles, which can help maintain a well-ordered, meaningful list of API proposals in the presence of dynamic reordering. These functionalities are grouped into a research prototype, BCC (Better Code Completion). We evaluated fourteen configurations of BCC by simulating Code Completion <b>nearly</b> <b>three</b> million <b>times</b> on nine open-source Java projects that utilize AWT/Swing...|$|R
5|$|The {{speed of}} sound in helium is <b>nearly</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> the {{speed of sound}} in air. Because the {{fundamental}} frequency of a gas-filled cavity is proportional to {{the speed of sound}} in the gas, when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. The fundamental frequency (sometimes called pitch) does not change, since this is produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds, which is unchanged. However, the higher resonant frequencies cause a change in timbre, resulting in a reedy, duck-like vocal quality. The opposite effect, lowering resonant frequencies, can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon.|$|E

The age of the cluster has been estimated to be about 12.7 billion years, and because all stars in a cluster form at about the same time, and planets form together with their host stars, it is likely that PSR B1620-26 b is also about 12.7 billion years old.

Atkinson speculated that the stalactite originated from Cat Hole cave, which (along with Tooth Hole cave) Whittle and Wysocki note as a possible source of the quartz too.|$|E

The coarse dendrites in the microstructure of the alloy without Sc and Zr additions are refined to the uniform and fine equiaxed grains. As the additions of Sc and Zr are 0. 4 % and 0. 2 %, respectively, the tensile strength, yield strength and elongation of the alloy are relatively better, which are 275. 0 MPa, 176. 0 MPa and 8. 0 % respectively.

There is an almost rectangular lateral temporal foramen at the back. The large, round orbit (eye socket), the sub-triangular antorbital fenestra and the oval naris (nostril) are of almost equal size. The jaws carried many small, leaf-shaped, socketed teeth: 5 to 6 per premaxilla, 24 to 30 per maxilla, and 21 to 28 per dentary (lower jaw). The thick, leaf-shaped, bluntly serrated tooth crowns were suitable for crushing plant material. The low position of the jaw joint gave the chewing muscles great leverage, so that Plateosaurus could deliver a powerful bite. These features suggest that it fed primarily to exclusively on plants. Its eyes were directed to the sides, rather than the front, providing all-round vision to watch for predators. Some fossil skeletons have preserved sclerotic rings (rings of bone plates that protect the eye).|$|E
5|$|At {{the behest}} of the Paris Observatory under le Verrier, Marie Alfred Cornu {{repeated}} Fizeau's 1848 toothed wheel measurement in a series of experiments in 1872–76. The goal was to obtain a value for the speed of light accurate to one part in a thousand. Cornu's equipment allowed him to monitor high orders of extinction, up to the 21st order. Instead of estimating the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, a relatively inaccurate procedure, Cornu made pairs of observations {{on either side of the}} intensity minima, averaging the values obtained with the wheel spun clockwise and counterclockwise. An electric circuit recorded the wheel rotations on a chronograph chart which enabled precise rate comparisons against the observatory clock, and a telegraph key arrangement allowed Cornu to mark on this same chart the precise moments when he judged that an extinction had been entered or exited. His final experiment was run over a path <b>nearly</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> as long as that used by Fizeau, and yielded a figure of 300400km/s that is within 0.2% of the modern value.|$|E
