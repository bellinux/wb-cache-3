25|$|In March 2009 Sudan President Omar al-Bashir {{ordered that}} all aid groups cease {{operations}} in Sudan within one year. Sudan had previously expelled 13 aid agencies, including Oxfam, Save the Children, and two branches of Médecins Sans Frontières. Some groups {{were required to}} leave the country within 24 hours and <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> of staff safety could be made. The International Criminal Court had issued a warrant for President Bashir's arrest and he accused the aid workers of spying on the Court's behalf.

25|$|In January 1947, as Romania {{prepared}} {{to sign the}} Paris Peace Treaty, he {{played a part in}} negotiating, with Premier Groza, Foreign Minister Tătărescu, and PCR activist Emil Bodnăraş, the Soviet takeover of islands on the Danube's Chilia branch. While Groza asked for Romania to receive the Hertza region and a small area north of Siret in exchange, Tătărescu opposed any change in the status quo, and Bodnăraş asked for promises of compensation to be made. Kavtaradze relayed his government's position that <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> were to be made, and the islands were ceded to the Soviet Union as part of the Paris Treaty system.|$|E
25|$|During hectic {{early summer}} 1936 {{negotiations}} with Mola, Baleztena and the fellow Navarrese pushed for almost unconditional Carlist {{access to the}} rebellion. Opposing cautious policy of Fal, they pursued a superseding strategy which bordered sabotage and is sometimes considered an internal coup within Carlism. As a result, the Requeté were committed to insurgency with <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> on part of the military. The Navarrese formed their own wartime body temporarily headed by Baleztena, Navarrese War Council, which implemented an independent political line and was only with difficulty acknowledged by the official Carlist wartime executive. Though Baleztena is not considered leader of the group, {{as head of the}} most important Carlist province he tilted the balance against the falcondistas.|$|E

25|$|Initially, upon {{accepting}} the State Counsellor position, she granted amnesty {{to the students}} who were arrested for opposing the National Education Bill, and announced a creation of the commission on Rakhine state, which had a long record of persecution of the Muslim Rohingya minority. However, soon Aung San Suu Kyi's government did not manage with the ethnic conflicts in Shan and Kachin states, where thousands of refugees fled to China, and eventually the persecution of the Rohingya by the government forces escalated {{to the point that it}} is not uncommonly called a genocide. Aung San Suu Kyi, when interviewed, has denied the allegations of ethnic cleansing. She has also refused to grant citizenship to the Rohingya, instead taking steps to issue ID cards for residency but <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> of citizenship.|$|E
25|$|The {{congress}} at Utrecht {{had not been}} accompanied by an armistice, yet Oxford and St John were determined not to fight another costly and potentially damaging campaign in Flanders. Even before Philip V gave his answer to the 'Savoy plan', Queen Anne had issued Marlborough's successor, the Duke of Ormonde, his 'Restraining Orders' (21 May), forbidding him to use British troops against the French. In effect, Anne's ministers had abandoned their allies {{in the field and}} made a separate deal with France, but they were convinced they had reached the best agreement possible, not just for themselves, but also for {{the other members of the}} Grand Alliance who were asked to join the Anglo-French suspension of arms. However, the Dutch – who had received <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> for their strategic and commercial interests – were inclined to fight on; as was Prince Eugene who was determined to breach the remaining fortresses guarding northern France and compel Louis XIV into making substantial concessions. On 4 July 1712, Eugene took Le Quesnoy; on the 17th he invested Landrecies, the last pré carré fortress between himself and Paris. British troops had by now pulled back to Ghent and Bruges, and in conformity with the agreement with France they also occupied Dunkirk. Nevertheless, the majority of Ormonde's German and Danish auxiliaries went over to Eugene who, following the Treaty of Szatmár and end of Rákóczi's revolt, also received reinforcements from Hungary, giving the Austrian commander a numerical advantage. Yet Villars, encouraged by Britain's withdrawal, decided to take the initiative. Feinting against the besiegers at Landrecies the French commander struck out for Denain and defeated the Earl of Albemarle's Dutch garrison on 24 July. The victory was pivotal. The French subsequently seized the Allies' main supply magazine at Marchiennes on 30 July, before reversing their earlier losses at Douai, Le Quesnoy and, in early October, Bouchain. The pré carré had been restored.|$|E

500|$|As {{the poem}} begins, Ulysses has {{returned}} to his kingdom, Ithaca, having made a long journey home after fighting in the Trojan War. Confronted again by domestic life, Ulysses expresses his lack of contentment, including his indifference toward the [...] "savage race" [...] (line 4) whom he governs. Ulysses contrasts his present restlessness with his heroic past, and contemplates his old age and eventual death—"Life piled on life / Were all too little, and of one to me / Little remains" [...] (24–26)—and longs for further experience and knowledge. His son Telemachus will inherit the throne that Ulysses finds burdensome. While Ulysses thinks that Telemachus {{will be a good}} king—"Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere / Of common duties" [...] (39)—he seems to have lost any connection to his son—"He works his work, I mine" [...] (43)—and the conventional methods of governing—"by slow prudence" [...] and [...] "through soft degrees" [...] (36, 37). In the final section, Ulysses turns to his fellow mariners and calls on them to join him on another quest, making <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> as to their fate but attempting to conjure their heroic past: ...|$|E

After beginning the season by hitting a home run on opening day, Rollins landed {{on the disabled list}} (DL) {{for the first time in}} his career in early April, suffering an ankle sprain. He returned in May, and had a [...] "productive" [...] summer, ultimately posting a career-high 47 stolen bases, notwithstanding his batting average dropping to [...]277, and his home run and RBI totals dropping to 11 and 59 respectively. In the postseason, Rollins was a focal point of the team, which ultimately won the 2008 World Series; in the division series (NLDS), he hit a leadoff home run in game four, and in the championship series (NLCS), he hit a leadoff home run in game five, and despite struggles early in the World Series, he eventually contributed with strong situational hitting, helping the Phillies win the series in five games. At the conclusion of the season, Rollins was honored with a Fielding Bible Award for defensive excellence as the top MLB shortstop during the year.|$|E

2500|$|Americans {{arriving}} {{at the port of}} Canton City were treated much the same as other foreigners willing to conduct trade through the co-hong, Chinese mercantile houses granted imperial monopolies in foreign commerce. The trade was lucrative, but foreign traders were social and political inferiors, with <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> for their lives, property, or rights of trade or residence. While this rankled the English, Americans and others were unwilling to meddle, lest that bring about what they feared most [...] a trade embargo. Congress under Captain John D. Henley, the first US naval vessel to call on China, arrived 3 November 1819 at Lintin Island. Chinese officials alarmed at the arrival of a warship, commanded her Captain not to enter the Pearl River. Advised by the U.S. consul that no adverse action would be taken, Captain Henley boldly entered to re-provision his ship. In January 1830, sloop-of-war Vincennes under Commander William B. Finch, then on America's first global circumnavigation, remained over a fortnight at Canton, where American merchants advised him that an annual naval visit would be valuable [...] if their commanders would show [...] "the same deference toward the customs of China, and conciliatory disposition as exhibited by yourself", which Finch duly reports to the Navy department. There is no indication that Finch's report was forwarded to State, or that Roberts had seen it, even though conditions were practically the same in all nearby [...] "Sinicized" [...] tributary kingdoms, i.e., conduct oneself circumspectly, with <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> one way or the other.|$|E
2500|$|Static storage {{duration}} objects are initialized in two phases. First, [...] "static initialization" [...] is performed, {{and only after}} all static initialization is performed, [...] "dynamic initialization" [...] is performed. [...] In static initialization, all objects are first initialized with zeros; after that, all objects that have a constant initialization phase are initialized with the constant expression (i.e. variables initialized with a literal or constexpr). Though it is not specified in the standard, the static initialization phase can be completed at compile time and saved in the data partition of the executable. [...] Dynamic initialization involves all object initialization done via a constructor or function call (unless the function is marked with constexpr, in C++11). The dynamic initialization order {{is defined as the}} order of declaration within the compilation unit (i.e. the same file). <b>No</b> <b>guarantees</b> are provided about the order of initialization between compilation units.|$|E

2500|$|The {{system of}} {{patronage}} in 16th- and early 17th-century astronomy {{was different from}} the modern definition of patronage. The system of patronage, in the context of Astronomers such as Galileo, Kepler, and Copernicus, was a complex system of relations held between such astronomers and other individuals of high social standing. [...] These relations allowed for the likes of Galileo to hold positions under such powerful people as the Medici family, granting him not only increased social status due to his relations with such high social ranks, but entry into these positions also allowed for the time and monies to work on scientific endeavors. As important as these relationships were for patrons such as Galileo, for reasons of gaining monies and higher social status, clients also found importance in patronage from the reciprocal nature of the relationship. Gifts to be bestowed upon clients, such as the Medici Stars given to the Medici family by Galileo (he named Jupiter’s moons after the family upon his discovery of them) gave increased social splendor and honor to the recipients of such extravagance and rarity. [...] The courts where these patronage relationships played out would also contribute to the “cognitive legitimation of the new science by providing venues for the social legitimation of its practitioners, and this, in turn, boosted the epistemological status of their discipline.” [...] Although Patronage can be explained as a system of social connections and relationships amongst social elite and practitioners of what we now umbrella under the term science, it was actually a “set of dyadic relations between patrons and clients, each of them unique… [...] no institutions and little if any formal structure. Patronage embodied <b>no</b> <b>guarantees,</b> and the “relation between patron and client was voluntary on both sides and subject always to disintegration” where past “performance counted {{only to the extent that}} it promised more in the future.” Westfall notes a “client's only claim on a patron was his capacity to illuminate further the magnificence of the man who recognized his value and encouraged him.” ...|$|E
