5|$|Early in this film, Denham {{shoots a}} scene for his film in which Ann, in-character, proclaims she's <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> ship before, and Bruce Baxter improvises lines proclaiming annoyance. The {{dialogue}} they exchange is taken verbatim from early scenes between Ann and Jack Driscoll in the 1933 film. Ironically, in this film, Jack Driscoll expresses disapproval of such words toward Ann.|$|E
500|$|The {{geography}} of Oldham constrained {{the development of}} major transport infrastructure, with the former County Borough Council suggesting that [...] "if it had not grown substantially before the railway age it would surely have been overlooked". Oldham has <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> main-line railway route, and canals too have only been able to serve it from a distance, meaning that [...] "Oldham {{has never had a}} train service worthy of a town of its size".|$|E
500|$|Elle's first chronological {{appearance}} is in [...] "Four Months Ago...". During this time, the Company made Peter Petrelli their willing prisoner {{and in those}} months he was held, Elle seems to have developed a cute crush on him. Peter confesses that he likes the little jolts which Elle gives him as a tease and kisses her. She confides in Peter that she {{has lived in the}} Company's holding facility for 16 years. She also admits to being diagnosed as a sociopath; she explains at age six, she accidentally set her grandmother's house on fire and, at age eight, caused a major blackout in Ohio. She also says that she spent her ninth birthday in a glass room with an IV of lithium in her arm. She also explains that she has <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> date and has never been swimming. When he escapes from the facility, Elle is upset and angry to the point that she blasts Peter, setting him ablaze during his escape. She then chases after Adam Monroe while the Haitian goes after Peter.|$|E
50|$|Between 1975 and 1983, Ulf Christiansson wrote many {{songs that}} Jerusalem never {{recorded}} but often played live. After a friend {{reminded him of}} these songs and asked why they had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> album, Christiansson decided to record them, {{but he wanted to}} use the band members who were in Jerusalem when the songs were actually written.|$|R

500|$|The {{tradition}} of the captain first hoisting the Cup has been [...] "breached" [...] a few times. In 1993 after the Montreal Canadiens defeated the Los Angeles Kings, Guy Carbonneau handed the Cup to Denis Savard, as Savard had been the player that many fans had urged the Canadiens to draft back in 1980. Another notable exception was in 1998, after the Detroit Red Wings had defeated the Washington Capitals, when Steve Yzerman immediately passed the Cup to Vladimir Konstantinov, whose career with the Red Wings ended due to serious injuries in a traffic accident the previous year {{and had to be}} wheeled on the ice. The third was involving Joe Sakic and Ray Bourque when the Colorado Avalanche won the Cup in 2001, as the seventh and deciding game of the Finals would be the last of Bourque's 22-year NHL career, having <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Cup-winning team until that time (Bourque had, until being traded to the Avalanche on March 6, 2000, only ever played for the Boston Bruins). When Sakic received the trophy, he did not hoist it, but instead immediately handed it to Bourque; Sakic then became the second player on the team to hoist the trophy.|$|E
500|$|On September 13, 2013, Anderson {{agreed to}} terms {{to return to}} the Mill Rats for the 2013–14 season. He hoped to carry his team to the {{championship}} with new head coach Rob Spon. Spon commented, [...] "I've finally got my wish to coach [...] come true. Instead of watching him torch me, I get to help him unleash his potential on other teams." [...] In his season debut on November 1, 2013, Anderson scored 23 points in a road win over the Halifax Rainmen. In a loss to the Moncton Miracles two games later on November 9, he added 28 points and seven assists. On November 24, Anderson recorded his first double-double of the season vs. the Miracles, with 22 points and 13 rebounds. Anderson had a 34-point performance in another rematch with Moncton on December 12, 2013. In late December, he scored over 30 points in back-to-back games against the Rainmen. Entering January 1, 2014, Anderson led the Mill Rats in scoring and stood 0.15 points per game behind Stefan Bonneau for being the top scorer in the NBL Canada. On January 16 and 17, he scored 37 and 39 points respectively against the Island Storm. On January 24, Anderson scored a season-high 40 points and recorded nine assists in another contest vs. the Storm. Despite holding an early lead, the Mill Rats were eventually defeated by the Island. In early February 2014, Anderson scored over 30 points in consecutive games against the Mississauga Power and the Brampton A's of the Central Division. He tied his season-best of 40 points in a victory over the Rainmen on February 23, with a season-high of seven three-pointers. Anderson scored 19 points in the third quarter and scored 15 straight at one point as well. In early April, he was named to the 2014 NBL Canada All-Star Game. Anderson helped the Atlantic Division capture the win, contributing 21 points, 12 assists, and nine rebounds. On April 19, 2014, Anderson won the Most Valuable Player award. He finished the season as the league's all-time leading scorer, with 2,121 points. Anderson later reflected on the year, saying, [...] "I have <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> team that was so together from the coach {{all the way down to}} the last guy... it was a family for real." ...|$|E
2500|$|A bronze Roman piece c. 200 BC to 200 AD {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} in the museum – it was {{discovered}} in 1960 and is a rare item that was unearthed after over 1,800 years. Wagner bought the item from Rik Gijsen, a Netherlands-based antiquities dealer. The piece was acquired by the museum in April 2006. Approximately 1,000 of the nutcrackers from the museum are highlighted in a book by Wagner, The Art and Character of Nutcrackers. The museum is open to visitors in the afternoon, from May to October; it is open to the public on weekends during the period from November to April. Arlene and George Wagner traveled the globe in search of nutcrackers for the museum: [...] "That's all we do! My husband and I have <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cruise. We just got back from Europe yesterday, hunting for nutcrackers. We went to the Netherlands. We attended a couple of very big European antique shows. We also had nutcrackers waiting for us to pick up – very valuable 16th and 17th century ones." ...|$|E

5|$|Olympic {{sports are}} governed by {{international}} sports federations (IFs) recognised by the IOC as the global supervisors of those sports. There are 35 federations represented at the IOC.

It was a different thing, now; for the ground was rough, and the horse going at a full gallop, and he clung on to the pummel of the saddle, to steady himself. As he passed through the village, he saw the Highlanders coming along at a trot, half a mile further on; and was soon beside Colonel Brownlow, who commanded them.|$|E

Accursed luck that Gyp had ever set eyes on this fellow Fiorsen, with his fatal fiddle! Certainly not since Gyp had come to live with him, fifteen years ago, had he felt so forlorn and fit for nothing. To-morrow he would get back to Mildenham and see what hard riding would do. Without Gyp--to be without Gyp! A fiddler! A chap who had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> horse in his life!

60|$|The {{short run}} by train to Lower Chain was quickly made, {{and the boys}} piled out, eager {{to be on their}} way.

Sparrer watched him with troubled face. Ever since the mention of skates the day before he had worried over that twelve mile trip down the lake. He knew that Upton and Harrison had brought skates, but he had none, and if he had had he couldn't have used them. He had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pair in his life. Skating is not an accomplishment of the lower East Side of New York.|$|E

60|$|It is {{wonderful}} {{what we can}} {{find the time to}} do, if we only try. Monsieur de Toqueville lent Honora novels, which she read in bed; but being in the full bloom of health and of a strong constitution, this practice did not prevent her from rising at seven to take a walk through the garden with Mr. Holt--a custom which he had come insensibly to depend upon. And in the brief conversations which she vouchsafed the Vicomte, they discussed his novels. In vain he pleaded, in caressing undertones, that she should ride with him. Honora had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> horse, but she did not tell him so. If she would but drive, or walk-only a little way--he would promise faithfully not to forget himself. Honora intimated that the period of his probation had not yet expired. If he waylaid her on the stairs, he got but little satisfaction.|$|E
60|$|We Scots, {{a hundred}} in all, in English colours, {{with three or}} four as prisoners, in our own badges, fared cautiously, and with no word spoken, through dewy woods, or lurking along in dry ditches where best we might, towards the St. Denis Gate of Paris. I had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> night {{surprise}} or bushment before, and I marvelled how orderly the others kept, as men used to such work, whereas I went stumbling and blindlings. At length, within sight of the twinkling lights of Paris, and a hundred yards or thereby off the common way, we were halted in a little wood, and bidden to lie down; no man was so much as to whisper. Some slept, I know, for I heard their snoring, but for my part, I never was less in love with sleep. When the sky first grew grey, so that we could dimly see shapes of things, we heard a light noise of marching men on the road.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{may as well}} do so as halt in the road. Besides, {{there are}} the things Ibrahim took over yesterday, to put into our saddlebags. There is another thing that I never thought of.

I wonder I did not think of it, though if I had, I don't see that {{anything}} else could have been done. We must see how she gets on, and if she cannot manage I must take her before me, whenever we see that the road is clear for a good distance ahead. Of course, it does not matter about country people, but if we see a body of troops coming in the distance, she must mount her own horse again, and follow us at a walk. If we find that things don't go well, we must halt in a wood somewhere, and ride only by night." ...|$|E
