I compared corresponding DAF distributions (Figure S 1). It was observed that the purifying pressure acting on UCEs/sUCEs is much stronger than the purifying pressure acting on other conserved non-repetitive sequences in the human genome. Similarly, DAF distributions of UCEs and sUCEs were significantly different from the corresponding DAF distributions of the remaining fraction of noncoding conserved human DNA (P<< 0. 01) with the exception of ASN SNPs in UCEs, for which statistical significance was not reached. Thus, despite observed rapid eradication of ultraconservation in primates, UCEs/sUCEs are under highly elevated purifying selection and their divergence is the result of active predominant mutational processes.

40|$|A recent {{development}} in microarray construction entails the unbiased coverage, or tiling, of <b>non-repetitive</b> genomic <b>DNA</b> {{for the experimental}} identification of unannotated transcribed sequences and regulatory elements. A central issue in designing tiling arrays is one of sequence similarity, as significant experimental cross-hybridization can result from the incorporation of non-unique probe sequences. Many genomes contain thousands of repetitive elements that must also be identified and omitted from the array design. Due to the fragmentation introduced by repeats, the problem of obtaining adequate sequence coverage increases with the sizes of subsequence tiles {{that are to be}} included on the array. Here we describe the general problem of designing arrays with tiles of varying sizes, and discuss the issues that arise when tiling with shorter and longer sequences. The general problem of sequence tiling can be framed as finding an optimal partitioning of nonrepetitive subsequence fragments, or tiles, for a given range of sizes on a DNA sequence containing repetitive and non-repetitive regions. Exact solutions to the tiling problem can become computationally infeasible when applied to large genomes, but we develo...|$|R

Electrophoretic mobility shift and DNAse foot-printing assays demonstrated the binding of mouse nuclear protein(s) to the CDEl-like box.

40|$|One of {{the most}} abiding controversies in {{evolutionary}} biology concerns the role of neutral processes in molecular evolution. A main focus of the debate has been the evolution of isochores, the strong and systematic variation of base composition in mammalian genomes. One set of hypotheses argue that regions of similar GC are owing to localised mutational biases coupled with neutral evolution, The alternatives point to either selection or biased gene conversion as mechanisms to preferentially remove A or T bases, favouring G and C instead. Using a novel method, we compare models including such fixation biases to models based on mutation bias alone, {{under the assumption that}} non-coding, <b>non-repetitive</b> human <b>DNA</b> is at compositional equilibrium. While failing to fully explain the allele frequency distributions of recent single nucleotide polymorphism data, we show that the data are best fitted if the mutation bias is assumed to be constant across the genome, while fixation bias varies with GC content. We also attempt to estimate the strength of fixation bias, which increases linearly with increasing GC. Our approximation suggests that this force exists within the necessary parameter range: it is not so weak as to be drowned by random drift, but not so strong as to lead to exclusive use of G and C alone. Together these results demonstrate that mutation bias fails to explain the evolution of isochores, and suggest that either selection or biased gene conversion are involved.

40|$|With {{increasing}} number of DNA sequences being discovered the problem of storing and using genomic databases has become vital. Since DNA sequences consist of only four letters, two bits are sufficient to store each base. Many algorithms have been proposed {{in the recent past}} that push the bits/base limit further. The subtle patterns in DNA along with statistical inferences have been exploited to increase the compression ratio. From the compression perspective, the entire DNA sequences can be considered to be made of two types of sequences: repetitive and non-repetitive. The repetitive parts are compressed used dictionary-based schemes and <b>non-repetitive</b> sequences of <b>DNA</b> are usually compressed using general text compression schemes. In this paper, we present a niemoization based encoding scheme for non-repeat DNA sequences.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{involved in}} the formation of subtelomeric rearrangements are now beginning to be elucidated. Breakpoint sequencing analysis of 1 p 36 rearrangements has made important contributions to this line of inquiry. Despite the unique architecture of segmental duplications inherent to human subtelomeres, no common mechanism has been identified thus far and different nonexclusive recombination-repair mechanisms seem to predominate. in order to gain further insights into the mechanisms of chromosome breakage, repair, and stabilization mediating subtelomeric rearrangements in humans, we investigated the constitutional rearrangements of 1 p 36. Cloning of the breakpoint junctions in a complex rearrangement and three non-reciprocal translocations revealed similarities at the junctions, such as microhomology of up to three nucleotides, along with no significant sequence identity in close proximity to the breakpoint regions. All the breakpoints appeared to be unique and their occurrence was limited to <b>non-repetitive,</b> unique <b>DNA</b> sequences. Several recombination- or cleavage-associated motifs that may promote non-homologous recombination were observed in close proximity to the junctions. We conclude that NHEJ is likely the mechanism of DNA repair that generates these rearrangements. Additionally, two apparently pure terminal deletions were also investigated, and the refinement of the breakpoint regions identified two distinct genomic intervals similar to 25 -kb apart, each containing a series of 1 p 36 specific segmental duplications with 90 - 98 % identity. Segmental duplications can serve as substrates for ectopic homologous recombination or stimulate genomic rearrangements.

40|$|The {{technological}} {{revolution of}} the twentieth century was famously subject to Moore’s law which related the rate of growth to the ability to scale-down the size of the components – size matters. Several decades later we are, however, approaching the limit of what is possible with silicon wafers. Moreover, the world is becoming ever-more environmentally conscious and technology is no longer merited simply by its short-term possibilities but its long-term consequences are also under scrutiny. The looming implication {{is that we need to}} change the materials on which we base our technology, and improve their efficiency. There are many options available to the researchers including carbon nanotubes, the manipulation of which is briefly touched upon here. The main focus of this thesis is, however, the bio-inspired approach – using simple assemblies of DNA fragments and lipid bilayers in water – to create miniscule structures with an inbuilt function that may one day operate as a nano-device. The fact that DNA possesses an inherent molecular recognition code makes it the ideal candidate for building information-rich structures. 	The studies in this thesis have concentrated on building the elements of a <b>non-repetitive</b> two-dimensional <b>DNA</b> network – forming structures that are less than 10 nm in diameter and that can be functionalised with a precision of less than 1 nm. Such a network could be used as e. g. a directed energy transfer circuit. Light, pH and temperature have been used to control the structures in a predictable manner – simple energy transfer steps across the structures have also been probed and we have established that relatively small changes in pH can be used to switch on and off communication between two points in the network. 	The fundamental interactions between a lipid bilayer and DNA are also considered, in order to understand how best to immobilise a DNA network on such a semi-fluidic support. One important finding is that there are both different interaction geometries and binding efficiencies for varying lengths of DNA in cationic lipid complexes, which may have serious implications not just in the field of nanotechnology but in the pursuit of such lipoplexes as vectors for antisense therapeutics. A second study shows that DNA strands can be tethered to a neutral lipid membrane using a porphyrin as a hydrophobic anchor and that energy and electron transfer processes can subsequently take place within such systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{majority}} of human non-protein-coding DNA {{is made up}} of repetitive sequences, mainly transposable elements (TEs). It is becoming increasingly apparent that many of these repetitive DNA sequence elements encode gene regulatory functions. This fact has important evolutionary implications, since repetitive DNA is the most dynamic part of the genome. We set out to assess the evolutionary rate and pattern of experimentally characterized human transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) that are derived from repetitive versus <b>non-repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> to test whether repeat-derived TFBS are in fact rapidly evolving. We also evaluated the position-specific patterns of variation among TFBS to look for signs of functional constraint on TFBS derived from repetitive and <b>non-repetitive</b> <b>DNA.</b> Results We found numerous experimentally characterized TFBS in the human genome, 7 – 10 % of all mapped sites, which are derived from repetitive DNA sequences including simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and TEs. TE-derived TFBS sequences are far less conserved between species than TFBS derived from SSRs and <b>non-repetitive</b> <b>DNA.</b> Despite their rapid evolution, several lines of evidence indicate that TE-derived TFBS are functionally constrained. First of all, ancient TE families, such as MIR and L 2, are enriched for TFBS relative to younger families like Alu and L 1. Secondly, functionally important positions in TE-derived TFBS, specifically those residues thought to physically interact with their cognate protein binding factors (TF), are more evolutionarily conserved than adjacent TFBS positions. Finally, TE-derived TFBS show position-specific patterns of sequence variation that are highly distinct from random patterns and similar to the variation seen for non-repeat derived sequences of the same TFBS. Conclusion The abundance of experimentally characterized human TFBS that are derived from repetitive DNA speaks to the substantial regulatory effects that this class of sequence has on the human genome. The unique evolutionary properties of repeat-derived TFBS are perhaps even more intriguing. TE-derived TFBS in particular, while clearly functionally constrained, evolve extremely rapidly relative to non-repeat derived sites. Such rapidly evolving TFBS are likely to confer species-specific regulatory phenotypes, i. e. divergent expression patterns, on the human evolutionary lineage. This result has practical implications with respect to the widespread use of evolutionary conservation as a surrogate for functionally relevant non-coding DNA. Most TE-derived TFBS would be missed using the kinds of sequence conservation-based screens, such as phylogenetic footprinting, that are used to help characterize non-coding DNA. Thus, the very TFBS that are most likely to yield human-specific characteristics will be neglected by the comparative genomic techniques that are currently de rigeur for the identification of novel regulatory sites. </p...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} gain more {{insights}} {{into the nature of}} structural transition near 3  pN, we performed the force-clamp measurements of chromatin fibers. Interestingly, a reversible folding and unfolding dynamical behavior was observed at 3.5  pN (Fig.  5 C), with the obvious transition step size of ~ 20  nm. The details of the folding and unfolding dynamics of chromatin fiber at 3.5  pN indicate that the structure transition with step of 20  nm is always accomplished within two steps, which corresponds to the two-step disruption of tetra-nucleosome structural unit (Fig.  5 D). Importantly, similar dynamic processes can be observed in the chromatin fibers assembled not only on regular tandem repeat of 601 DNA sequence but also on the scrambled (<b>non-repetitive)</b> <b>DNA</b> sequence, suggesting that the existence of tetra-nucleosome units is not dependent on DNA sequence. By using the modified single-molecule magnetic tweezers method, we show that the tetra-nucleosome unit exists as a stable structural intermediate of the 30 -nm chromatin fiber and further unfolds to a more extended “beads-on-a-string” conformation by disrupting the nucleosome–nucleosome interactions within tetranucleosomal unit (Fig.  5 E) (Li et al. 2016 b).|$|E

Instead, Southern blot hybridization analysis of seven kanamycin resistant calli revealed the presence {{of at least one}} kanamycin resistance locus per transformant integrated in the tomato nuclear DNA. Generally one to three truncated plasmid copies were found integrated into the tomato nuclear DNA, often physically linked to each other.

D. mojavensis, an ecological specialist adapted to a cactophilic niche under extreme desert conditions, is a chromosomally derived species with ten fixed inversions, five of them not present in any other species. Results In order to explore the causes of the rapid chromosomal evolution in D. mojavensis, we identified and characterized all breakpoints of seven inversions fixed in chromosome 2, the most dynamic one. One of the inversions presents unequivocal evidence for its generation by ectopic recombination between transposon copies and another two harbor inverted duplications of <b>non-repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> at the two breakpoints and were likely generated by staggered single-strand breaks and repair by non-homologous end joining. Four out of 14 breakpoints lay in the intergenic region between preexisting duplicated genes, suggesting an adaptive advantage of separating previously tightly linked duplicates. Four out of 14 breakpoints are associated with transposed genes, suggesting these breakpoints are fragile regions. Finally two inversions contain novel genes at their breakpoints and another three show alterations of genes at breakpoints with potential adaptive significance. Conclusions D. mojavensis chromosomal inversions were generated by multiple mechanisms, an observation that does not provide support for increased mutation rate as explanation for rapid chromosomal evolution. On the other hand, we have found a number of gene alterations at the breakpoints with putative adaptive consequences that directly point to natural selection as the cause of D. mojavensis rapid chromosomal evolution. </p...|$|E
40|$|During {{adaptation}} to the host environment, many microorganisms undergo rapid variation in cell surface phenotype through genetic alteration in hypermutable contingency genes. One of the main mechanisms underlying these changes is alteration {{in the number of}} DNA repeat units that results in a large and flexible repertoire of similar but non-identical surface proteins. SSR 1, a gene in the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans, encodes a repeat-containing cell wall protein which {{may play a role in}} maintaining cell wall strength. This gene contains 2 regions with multiple 6 bp tandem repeat units, encoding the amino acids serine and alanine, separated by a 200 bp <b>non-repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> region. This study investigated whether SSR 1 was a hypermutable contingency gene. Among a worldwide collection of 96 infection-causing C. albicans strains, 24 alleles and 40 allele combinations were identified by fluorescent-based genotyping of SSR 1 PCR products. Sequencing results confirmed that the differences in allele size were caused by variation in number of tandem repeats. Two very similar allele combinations were overrepresented (30 % and 28 %) among a cluster of generalpurpose genotype (GPG) strains (which is the most widespread cluster) compared with non-GPG strains (Fisher’s exact test, P= 0. 0001 and P< 0. 0001). Among a worldwide collection of 36 commensal GPG C. albicans strains, 8 allele combinations were identified by genotyping. One of the two allele combinations that were overrepresented in GPG infection-causing strains was found significantly less in GPG commensal strains (Fisher’s exact test, P= 0. 0004). After culture of C. albicans cells in vitro for 300 generations, mutation of repeats in SSR 1 occurred, giving a high mutation rate of 1. 11 × 10 - 4 per cell division. The results indicate that SSR 1 is a hypermutable gene and that it shows clade-specificity with the GPG cluster. Growth in a rat model did not seem to cause variation in SSR 1 and human host body sites did not seem to be associated with specific SSR 1 alleles, suggesting that SSR 1 is not used for short-term adaptation in these environments. However, the different allele distribution in commensal and infection-causing GPG strains suggest that SSR 1 may have a role in short-term adaptation in GPG strains, contributing to the change between commensalism and infection. In this case, SSR 1 may act as a hypermutable contingency gene...|$|E
