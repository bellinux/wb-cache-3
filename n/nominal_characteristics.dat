A <b>nominal</b> <b>characteristic</b> trajectory following (NCTF) controller is used to actively control the vibration of flexible structures. The controller design, which is comprised of a <b>nominal</b> <b>characteristic</b> trajectory (NCT) and PI compensator, is free from exact modelling and parameter identification. The NCT is determined from an open-loop response and the PI compensator is {{used to make the}} manipulator motion to follow the NCT. The effectiveness of the NCTF controller is evaluated and compared with proportional-derivative (PD) controller and fuzzy logic controller as a benchmark. A complete analysis of simulation results for each technique is presented in time domain and frequency domain respectively. Moreover, performances of the controller are examined in terms of vibration suppression and disturbances cancellation. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an {{improvement of the}} existing <b>nominal</b> <b>characteristic</b> trajectory following (NCTF) as a practical control method for a two-mass rotary point-to-point (PTP) positioning systems. Generally, the NCTF controller consists of a <b>nominal</b> <b>characteristic</b> trajectory (NCT) and a PI compensator. A notch filter is added {{as a part of}} the compensator to eliminate the vibration due to the mechanical resonance of the plant. The objective of the NCTF controller is to make the object motion follow the NCT and end at its origin. The NCTF controller is designed based on a simple open-loop experiment of the object. The parameters identification and an exact model of the plant are not necessary for controller design. The performance response of improved NCTF controller is evaluated and discussed based on results of simulation. The effect of the design parameters on the robustness of the NCTF controller to inertia and friction variations is evaluated and compared with conventional PID controller. The results show that the improved NCTF controller has a better positioning performance and is much more robust than the PID controller...|$|R

50|$|The {{electrical}} characteristics of DMX512 cable are specified {{in terms of}} impedance and capacitance, although there are often mechanical and other considerations that must be considered as well. Cable types that are appropriate for DMX512 usage will have a <b>nominal</b> <b>characteristic</b> impedance of 120 ohms. Cat5 cable, commonly used for networking and telecommunications, has been tested by ESTA for use with DMX512A. Also, cables designed for EIA485 typically meet the DMX512 electrical specifications. Conversely, microphone and line level audio cables lack the requisite {{electrical characteristics}} and thus are not suitable for DMX512 cabling. The significantly lower impedance and higher capacitance of these cables distort the DMX512 digital waveforms, which in turn can cause irregular operation or intermittent errors {{that are difficult to}} identify and correct.|$|R

40|$|Motion {{control system}} is a {{challenging}} problem {{in the area of}} control systems. It is very useful to demonstrate concepts in linear control such as the stabilization of unstable systems. Motion control system plays important roles in industrial equipment such as machine tools, semiconductor manufacturing systems and robot systems. One type of motion control systems is point-to-point (PTP) positioning system, which is used to move an object from one point to another point. Linear motion servo {{system is a}} machine that move cart from one point to another point. This system consists of a cart driven by a DC motor, via a rack and pinion mechanism to ensure consistent and continuous traction. Up to now many types of controllers have been proposed and evaluated for positioning systems. Two type of controller that discussed in this thesis are Proportional-Velocity (PV) and <b>Nominal</b> <b>Characteristic</b> Trajectory Following (NCTF). The experimental results showed that the PV was successfully implemented which controlled the settling time, rise time and steady-state error of the desired position. However, the overshoot performances show its disadvantages. Additionally, the PV controller design is time consuming process, since model and parameters of the linear motion servo system are needed. Therefore, the needs for higher performance controller become important for the simplicity of the controller design. Hence, the investigation proceed with the non-model based NCTF controller was to control the cart position of the linear motion servo system. The NCTF controller consists of a <b>Nominal</b> <b>Characteristic</b> Trajectory (NCT) and PI compensator. The NCTF controller was designed based on a simple open-loop experiment of the object. The experimental results showed that the NCTF controller is more effective for controlling position oflinear motion servo system than the PV controller...|$|R

40|$|Real {{equilibrium}} solutions {{of electronic}} circuits {{are affected by}} deviation of real characteristics of devices from their nominal values, producing the displacement of solution points from their nominal position. In this paper, a method to determine all the equilibrium regions in which real equilibrium points may fall is presented. The analysis {{is based on the}} introduction of the so-called strip characteristics that represent the characteristics of devices affected by tolerances. They are modeled by polyhedral characteristics. Different situations may occur as tolerances grow. A nominal solution point may disappear, or on the other end, some solution point not present with <b>nominal</b> <b>characteristics</b> may appear. These possible events call for a classification of the equilibrium regions in either certain or uncertain, depending on the existence or not of an equilibrium point for any choice of real characteristics.

Â For satisfying these requirements, <b>nominal</b> <b>characteristic</b> trajectory following controller (NCTF) has been proposed as a practical point-to-point (PTP) positioning control.

40|$|A {{new model}} of {{photovoltaic}} (PV) fields is introduced in this paper. It allows the simulation of a PV generator whose subsections, e. g. cells, groups of cells, panels or group of panels, work under different solar irradiation values and/or at different temperatures. Moreover, different <b>nominal</b> <b>characteristics,</b> rated power, production technology, shape and area can be settled for different subsections. Consequently, the proposed model is able to describe the behaviour of matched as well as mismatched PV fields. It results into a non linear system of equations, which includes bypass and blocking diodes models and {{is characterized by a}} sparse Jacobian matrix. The numerical model is reliable and requires a moderate computational burdensome, both in terms of memory use and processor speed. Numeric simulations confirm the accuracy and cheapness of the approach. The proposed model is used to simulate the drawbacks associated to mismatching during maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the PV generator...|$|E

We show that two microlevel mechanisms, in combination, imply a system-level tendency toward consensual status beliefs about a <b>nominal</b> <b>characteristic.</b> (1) Status belief diffusion: a person who has no status belief about a characteristic can acquire a status belief about that characteristic from interacting with one or more people who have that status belief. (2) Status belief loss: a person who has a status belief about a characteristic can lose that belief from interacting with one or more people who have the opposite status belief. These mechanisms imply that opposite status beliefs will tend to be lost at equal rates and will tend to be acquired at rates proportional to their prevalence. Therefore, if a status belief ever becomes more prevalent than its opposite, it will increase in prevalence until every person holds it...|$|R
