5|$|Critics had a mixed {{reaction}} to the episode, with many characterising it as somewhat weaker than others in the series, with the change in tone dividing commentators.

5|$|A {{separate}} 2008 {{study from}} Western Michigan University found that hybrids and conventional vehicles are equally safe when travelling {{more than about}} , because tire and wind noise generate most of the audible cues at those speeds. Hybrid cars were also tested safe when leaving a stoplight and {{it was found that}} under this condition they do not pose a risk to pedestrians. All Prius models used in the study engaged their internal combustion engines when accelerating from a standstill and produced enough <b>noise</b> <b>to</b> be detected.|$|E

Hardie, {{who was in a}} bookmakers {{at the time of the}} call, suggests that Bulloch and Paul Savage continue mixing the song, and says he will try to contact Braithwaite.

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} perturbed {{gradient}} algorithm with stochastic <b>noises</b> <b>to</b> solve a general class of optimization problems. We provide a convergence proof for this algorithm, under classical assumptions on the descent direction, and new assumptions on the stochastic noises. Instead of requiring the stochastic <b>noises</b> <b>to</b> correspond to martingale increments, we only require these <b>noises</b> <b>to</b> be asymptotically so. Furthermore, {{the variance of}} these <b>noises</b> is allowed <b>to</b> grow infinitely {{under the control of}} a decreasing sequence linked with the gradient stepsizes. We then compare this new approach and assumptions with classical ones in the stochastic approximation literature. As an application of this general setting, we show how the algorithm to solve infinite dimensional stochastic optimization problems recently developped by the authors in another paper is a special case of the following perturbed gradient with stochastic noises...|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s and through to the 1930s, the thinking on noise was dominated by the radio engineers' concern with external static. In modern terminology, this would include random (thermal and shot) noise but those concepts were relatively unknown and little understood at the time despite an early paper by Schottky in 1918 on shot <b>noise.</b> <b>To</b> the radio engineers of the time, static meant externally generated interference. The line of attack against noise from the radio engineers included developing directional antennae and moving to higher frequencies where the problem was known not to be so severe.|$|E
5|$|Carson and Zobel in 1923 had {{conclusively}} {{shown that}} filtering cannot remove <b>noise</b> <b>to</b> {{the same degree}} as, say, interference from another station could be removed. To do this they had analyzed random noise in the frequency domain and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum. This was the first use of Fourier analysis to describe random noise and hence described {{it in terms of}} a spread of frequencies. Also first published in this paper was the concept of what we would now call band-limited white noise. For Zobel this meant that characteristics of the receiving filter completely determine the figure of merit in the presence of white noise and that the filter design was key to achieving the optimum noise performance.|$|E

5|$|In both {{recording}} and in live musical sound reinforcement, {{the key to}} noise minimisation is headroom. Headroom can be used either to reduce distortion and audio feedback by keeping signal levels low, or to reduce interference, both from outside sources and from the Johnson-Nyquist noise produced in the equipment, by keeping signal levels high. Most proprietary noise reducing technologies also introduce low levels of distortion. Noise minimisation therefore becomes a compromise between interference and distortion, both in {{recording and}} in live music, and between interference and feedback in live amplification. The work of Bart Kosko and Sanya Mitaim has also demonstrated that stochastic resonance {{can be used as}} a technique in noise minimisation and signal improvement in non-linear dynamical systems, as the addition of <b>noise</b> <b>to</b> a signal can improve the signal-to-noise ratio.|$|E
5|$|In some circumstances, {{the conduct}} of the {{defendant}} can be a factor in determining the unreasonableness of their interference. In this situation the motives of the defendant and the reasonableness of their conduct are the factors used to determine the unreasonableness of their actions. This {{is one of the few}} exceptions to the rule that malice is not relevant in tort law. In Christie v Davey, the defendant was deliberately creating a <b>noise</b> <b>to</b> frustrate the claimants; based on this, it was held that their actions were malicious, unreasonable, and amounted to a nuisance.|$|E
5|$|Many unpitched {{percussion}} instruments, {{such as the}} snare drum or maracas, {{make use}} of the presence of random sounds or <b>noise</b> <b>to</b> produce a sound without any perceived pitch. See timbre. Unpitched percussion is typically used to maintain a rhythm or to provide accents, and its sounds are unrelated to the melody and harmony of the music. Within the orchestra unpitched percussion is termed auxiliary percussion, and this subsection of the percussion section includes all unpitched instruments of the orchestra no matter how they are played, for example the pea whistle and siren.|$|E

Image fidelity metrics such as mean square error(MSE), signal <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> ratio(SNR),peak signal <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> ratio(PSNR), weighted peak signal <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> ratio(WPSNR) are being used. However, when large quantities of data are to be assessed, subjective metrics such as mean opinion score(MOS),signal <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> ratio(SNR),peak signal <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> ratio(PSNR) are not pragmatic since it needs experts and inordinate amount of time. PSNR and WPSNR are independent of human visual system(HVS) parameters and hence they are inappropriate scales to measure potential research results. This brings out a new image fidelity metric called Enhanced Weighted peak signal <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> ratio(EWPSNR) which is experimentally proven to be better than PSNR and WPSNR...|$|R

Females are able to {{conceive}} at as early as six to seven months, whereas males do not attain sexual maturity until two years; rut lasts 5 to 21 days. When a female approaches a rutting male, the male holds his head and tail at level with the ground, lowers his horns, and makes a loud grunting <b>noise</b> <b>to</b> attract her. The male then urinates and sniffs the female's perineum. If the female is receptive, she urinates, as well, and the male makes a flehmen gesture, and taps his leg till the female leaves or permits him to mate. Copulation consists of a single pelvic thrust.|$|E

Snake can also make use of many items and gadgets, such as infra-red goggles and a cardboard box disguise. The emphasis on stealth promotes a less violent form of gameplay, as fights against large groups of enemies will often result in serious damage for the player.|$|E
5|$|As the {{deadline}} of noon approached, set {{the previous day}} {{for the release of}} the Arab prisoners, the police became convinced that the gunmen did not have the capability to carry out their threat of blowing up the embassy, and persuaded Oan to agree to a new deadline of 14:00. The police allowed {{the deadline}} to pass, to no immediate response from the gunmen. During the afternoon, Oan altered his demands, requesting that the British media broadcast a statement of the group's grievances and for ambassadors of three Arab countries to negotiate the group's safe passage out of the UK once the statement had been broadcast. At approximately 20:00, Oan became agitated by noises coming from the Ethiopian Embassy next door. The noise came from technicians who were drilling holes in the wall to implant listening devices, but PC Trevor Lock, when asked to identify the sound, attributed it to mice. COBRA decided to create ambient <b>noise</b> <b>to</b> cover the sound created by the technicians and instructed British Gas to commence drilling in an adjacent road, supposedly to repair a gas main. The drilling was aborted after it agitated the gunmen, and instead British Airports Authority, owner of London Heathrow Airport, was told to instruct approaching aircraft to fly over the embassy at low altitude.|$|E
