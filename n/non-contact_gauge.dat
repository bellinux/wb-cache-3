The accuracy of the machine itself is negligible, as the environment the machine is the limiting factor to effective accuracy. The earlier mechanical machines were built to hold 10 to 20 millionths of an inch accuracy across the entire machine envelope, and due to incredible machine design and forethought, remain as accurate today without computer compensation.|$|E

It also tries to explain the basic knowledge of machine tools and their thermal load. Part {{of the work is}} to test this knowledge with experiments in the company Intemac Solutions s. r. o. and Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at Brno University of Technology. The obtained results are further evaluated and compared with the help of graphs and tables. To process the obtained data from the sensors, program Labview was used and FLIR Tools was used for thermal pictures taken with thermal camera.

40|$|In {{the machine}} of bottom glueing of paper sacs the {{adhesive}} is applicated on stepped and folded sack papers by stereotype rolls. The glue application is interrupted and very fast - up to 250 sacs/min. In {{order to achieve}} not only strong but also tight joints of the uneven surfaces the operators tend to overdose the glue application. The consequency of the usage of a water solved starch glue in the most cases, are to wet sack walls with reduced mechanical strength. An expensive conditioning for several weeks is necessary before the sacs can be filled up by the automatical filling apparatus. Therefore, in order {{to cope with the}} wetness of the sack thin and regular glue layers are required. To avoid an underdosing of the glue, an application control is indispensable. The most important prerequisition for an effective glue application control in the machine for bottom gluing of paper sacs is the employment of efficient sensors. Two sensor systems for <b>non-contact</b> <b>gauging</b> were developed. The y both operate in line and in real time. The acquired signals are supplied to a computer process control system. The physical principles in one case the measurements of the micro wave absorption and in the second case measurement of the fluorescence light intensity. The construction and functioning of the systems are described. In part 1 of this publication the fluorimetry technique is treated. In part 2 (in preparation) the results of the measurements with the microwave sensor and the conditions for the integration of the sensors in the machine of bottom gluing are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the statistics of parameters of hyperelastic models specific to Polybutylene Terephthalate filled with 30 % glass fibre (PBT GF 30) and Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) materials used in automotive lamps. The hyperelastic behaviour of both materials, a semi-crystalline and an amorphous, is modelled using appropriate hyperelastic models. The stress-strain curves of the materials were measured under uniaxial tension using a <b>non-contact</b> video <b>gauge.</b> Five samples each were tested to measure the effect of manufacturing variability. The model parameter statistics were determined, the mean value of the model parameters were used to construct average stress-strain behavior, which is then compared to the experimental stresses. Among all the models and their associated parameters studied, the 3 -parameter Mooney-Rivlin model provided the most accurate prediction of the behaviour for both materials. The model showed excellent stability and is therefore the most appropriate model to represent variations due to the manufacturing process. The detailed study of the correlation of the model parameters provided a good understanding of how the parameters are related to each other, enabling construction of complete probability distribution functions for further analysis...|$|R
40|$|The factors {{responsible}} for {{modifications to the}} wettability characteristics of a nickel-titanium (NiTi) medical alloy following CO 2 laser treatment were considered in this work. These modifications have been investigated {{in terms of the}} changes in the surface energy components, the surface topography and the surface chemical composition profile. Contact angles, q, were measured by the sessile drop technique using water and diodomethane. The surface chemical profiles were determined using <b>non-contact</b> confocal point <b>gauge</b> and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX). It was found that the surface roughness is the factor influencing the wettability characteristics, a critical point was predicted as the transition point from improving to degrading the surface energy with the increasing in surface roughness. q measurements revealed that the laser-alloyed NiTi exhibited a considerable reduction in q, implying that laser surface alloying technique improved the wettability characteristics of this material.

40|$|Cake fouling is a {{phenomenon}} contributing to flux decline during cross-flow filtration. Its behaviour is also difficult to predict, especially for challenging separations where organic materials often form compressible cakes with a high resistance. In this study Kraft lignin {{was used as a}} model material for organic foulants in cross-flow microfiltration experiments, and a <b>non-contact</b> fluid dynamic <b>gauging</b> (FDG) technique in pressure-mode configuration was used to study the cake fouling layers in situ. A new and enhanced FDG equipment was used; enabling an increased accuracy of the fouling layer thickness measurements and capable of producing higher fluid shear stresses {{on the surface of the}} cake layer for strength measurements. Using FDG, very thin fouling layers were observed; in addition, FDG was used to investigate their cohesive and adhesive strengths, showing that over a 10 -fold increase in fluid shear stress was required to remove foulant closer to the membrane compared with that on the surface of the cake...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of a new large scale laboratory data set on the kinematics of breaking tsunami wavefronts. The aim of the experiments was to provide an open access data set for model testing, calibration and verification, with particular emphasis on fluid kinematics in the wave breaking and run-up (swash) zones. The experiments were performed over a composite slope in the tsunami wave basin at the O. H. Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory at Oregon State University. Data for ten different wave conditions were collected, including non-breaking and breaking waves, and both shore breaks and fully developed long bores. Surface elevation and fluid kinematics were measured with a closely spaced array of surface piercing wave <b>gauges,</b> <b>non-contact</b> ultrasonic wave <b>gauges</b> and four 3 -D side-looking Acoustic Doppler Velocimeters. The array was traversed from the nearshore (depth= 0. 2 m) to the middle and upper run-up zone, providing kinematic data at 30 cross-shore locations. Video was also recorded from 4 cameras covering the propagation, breaking and run-up zones. Surface elevation, flow velocities and the wave maker displacement were also recorded to provide offshore boundary conditions. The experiments include conditions with wave heights up to 0. 55 m, notional wave periods up to 20 s and runup lengths of up to 15. 2 m on a 1 / 30 slope. In terms of the slope in the shoaling and breaker zones, the data correspond to Iribarren numbers in the range of 0. 26 - 5. 6. Raw, calibrated and processed data are stored with open access within the OSU Tsunami Wave Basin Experiment Notebook, which provides full access to all the wave maker control signals, data, instrument coordinates, and processing and plotting software. This paper serves as an introduction to the data set, demonstrates data quality and {{provides an}} initial analysis of some key parameters that govern the impact of tsunami events, including run-up versus offshore wave conditions and nearshore bore height, the maximum inundation depths at the original shoreline position, and the time to maximum inundation depth and flow reversal. Examples of temporal and convective accelerations and turbulent flow components are also presented to illustrate further details of the kinematics. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{competitive}} market demands frequent change in product variety, increased production volume and shorten product/process change over time. These market requirements point towards development of key enabling technologies (KETs) to shorten product and process development cycle, improved production quality and reduced time-to-launch. One {{of the critical}} prerequisite to develop the aforementioned KETs is efficient and accurate modelling of product and process dimensional errors. It is especially critical for assembly processes with compliant parts as used in automotive body, appliance or wing and fuselage assemblies. Currently, the assembly process is designed under the assumption of ideal (nominal) products and then check by using variation simulation analysis (VSA). However, the VSA simulations are oversimplified as {{they are unable to}} accurately model or predict the effects of geometric and dimensional variations of compliant parts, as well as variations of key characteristics related to fixturing and joining process. This results in product failures and/or reduced quality due to un-modelled interactions in assembly process. Therefore, modelling and prediction of the geometric shape errors of complex sheet metal parts are of tremendous importance for many industrial applications. Further, as production yield and product quality are determined for production volume of real parts, thus not only shape errors but also shape variation model is required for robust assembly system development. Currently, parts shape variation can be measured during production by using recently introduced <b>non-contact</b> <b>gauges</b> which are fast, in-line and can capture entire part surface information. However, current applications of non-contact scanners are limited to single part inspection or reverse engineering applications and cannot be used for monitoring and statistical process control of shape variation. Further, the product shape variation can be reduced through appropriate assembly fixture design. Current approaches for assembly fixture design seldom consider shape variation of production parts during assembly process which result in poor quality and yield. To address the aforementioned challenges, this thesis proposes the following two enablers focused on modelling of shape errors and shape variation of compliant parts applicable during assembly process design phase as well as production phase: (i) modelling and characterisation of shape errors of individual compliant part with capabilities to quantify fabrication errors at part level; and (ii) modelling and characterisation of shape variation of a batch of compliant parts with capabilities to quantify the shape variation at production level. The first enabler focuses on shape errors modelling and characterisation which includes developing a functional data analysis model for identification and characterisation of real part shape errors that can link design (CAD model) with manufacturing (shape errors). A new functional data analysis model, named Geometric Modal Analysis (GMA), is proposed to extract dominant shape error xixmodes from the fabricated part measurement data. This model is used to decompose shape errors of 3 D sheet metal part into orthogonal shape error modes which can be used for product and process interactions. Further, the enabler can be used for statistical process control to monitor shape quality; fabrication process mapping and diagnosis; geometric dimensioning and tolerancing simulation with free form shape errors; or compact storage of shape information. The second enabler aims to model and characterise shape variation of a batch of compliant parts by extending the GMA approach. The developed functional model called Statistical Geometric Modal Analysis (SGMA) represents the statistical shape variation through modal characteristics and quantifies shape variation of a batch of sheet metal parts a single or a few composite parts. The composite part(s) represent major error modes induced by the production process. The SGMA model, further, can be utilised for assembly fixture optimisation, tolerance analysis and synthesis. Further, these two enablers can be applied for monitoring and reduction of shape variation from assembly process by developing: (a) efficient statistical process control technique (based on enabler ‘i’) to monitor part shape variation utilising the surface information captured using non-contact scanners; and (b) efficient assembly fixture layout optimisation technique (based on enabler ‘ii’) to obtain improved quality products considering shape variation of production parts. Therefore, this thesis proposes the following two applications: The first application focuses on statistical process control of part shape variation using surface data captured by in-process or off-line scanners as Cloud-of-Points (CoPs). The methodology involves obtaining reduced set of statistically uncorrelated and independent variables from CoPs (utilising GMA method) which are then used to develop integrated single bivariate T 2 -Q monitoring chart. The joint probability density estimation using non-parametric Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) has enhanced sensitivity to detect part shape variation. The control chart helps speedy detection of part shape errors including global or local shape defects. The second application determines optimal fixture layout considering production batch of compliant sheet metal parts. Fixtures control the position and orientation of parts in an assembly process and thus significantly contribute to process capability that determines production yield and product quality. A new approach is proposed to improve the probability of joining feasibility index by determining an N- 2 - 1 fixture layout optimised for a production batch. The SGMA method has been utilised for fixture layout optimisation considering a batch of compliant sheet metal parts. All the above developed methodologies have been validated and verified with industrial case studies of automotive sheet metal door assembly process. Further, they are compared with state-of-the-art methodologies to highlight the boarder impact of the research work to meet the increasing market requirements such as improved in-line quality and increased productivity...|$|R
