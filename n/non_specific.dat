25|$|Concerning {{immunological}} adaptation, it {{was discovered}} that wild common ostriches have a pronounced <b>non</b> <b>specific</b> immunity defense, with blood content reflecting high values of lysosome, and phagocyte cells in medium. This is in contrast to domesticated ostriches, who in captivity develop high concentration of immunoglobulin antibodies in their circulation, indicating an acquired immunological response. It is suggested that this immunological adaptability may allow this species to have a high success rate of survival in variable environmental settings.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{cutaneous}} (skin) {{conditions can}} also involve {{the mouth and}} sometimes only the mouth, sparing the skin. The different environmental conditions (saliva, thinner mucosa, trauma from teeth and food), mean that some cutaneous disorders which produce characteristic lesions on the skin produce only <b>non</b> <b>specific</b> lesions in the mouth. The vesicles and bullae of blistering mucocutaneous disorders progress quickly to ulceration in the mouth, because of moisture and trauma from food and teeth. The high bacterial load in the mouth means that ulcers may become secondarily infected. Cytotoxic drugs administered during chemotherapy target cells with fast turnovers such as malignant cells. However, the epithelia of the mouth also has a high turnover rate and makes oral ulceration (mucositis) a common side effect of chemotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Specific binding {{refers to}} the binding of a ligand to a receptor, and it is {{possible}} that {{there is more than one}} specific binding site for one ligand. <b>Non</b> <b>specific</b> binding {{refers to the}} binding of a ligand to something other than its designated receptor such as various other receptors, or different types of transporters in the cell membrane. For example, various antagonists can bind to multiple types receptors. In the case of muscarinic antagonists, they can also bind to histamine receptors. Such binding patterns are technically considered specific, as the destination of the ligand is specific to multiple receptors. However, researchers may not be focused on such behaviors compared to other binding factors. Nevertheless, nonspecific binding behavior is very important information to acquire. These estimates are measured by examining how a ligand binds to a receptor while simultaneously reacting to a substitute agent (antagonist) that will prevent specific binding to occur.|$|E

500|$|An aphtha (plural aphthae) is a <b>non</b> <b>specific</b> {{term that}} refers to an ulcer of the mouth. The word {{is derived from the}} Greek word aphtha meaning [...] "eruption" [...] or [...] "ulcer". The lesions of several other oral {{conditions}} are sometimes described as aphthae, including Bednar's aphthae (infected, traumatic ulcers on the hard palate in infants), oral candidiasis, and foot-and-mouth disease. When used without qualification, aphthae commonly refers to lesions of recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Since the word aphtha is often taken to be synonymous with ulcer, {{it has been suggested that}} the term [...] "aphthous ulcer" [...] is redundant, but it remains in common use. Stomatitis is also a non-specific term referring to any inflammatory process in the mouth, with or without oral ulceration. It may describe many different conditions apart from aphthous stomatitis such as angular stomatitis.|$|E

2500|$|Barbiturates like {{pentobarbital}} can {{act like}} free radical scavengers as well decrease intracranial blood volume by reducing cerebral metabolic demand. However, administration of barbiturates poses risks such as hypotension, induced coma and infection limiting their potential clinical application. Although corticosteroids {{are not very}} effective in treating cerebral edema resulting from ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage, they are very effective in treating vasogenic edema resulting from brain tumors. Idea behind administration of both barbiturates and corticosteroids is to provide space for cerebral swelling resulting from edema, thus, these [...] are very <b>non</b> <b>specific</b> treating methods.|$|E

We could demonstrate the non specificity of these antibodies through using the same assay in a modified form where beads were unexposed to cell lysate and therefore did not carry HLA antigens at all. These cases further serve to emphasize the absolute necessity of correlating positive results with the priming history, and confirming their relevance using other platforms...|$|R
