25|$|The {{reason why}} Odo was {{defeated}} so easily at Bordeaux and Garonne, but had won 11 years earlier at the Battle of Toulouse is simple. At Toulouse, Odo managed a surprise attack against an overconfident and unprepared foe. The Umayyad forces were mostly infantry, and what cavalry {{they did have}} <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> mobilize. As Herman of Carinthia wrote {{in one of his}} translations of a history of al-Andalus, Odo managed a highly successful encircling envelopment which took the attackers totally by surprise – the result was a chaotic slaughter of the Muslim forces.|$|E

On the first day of training camp on December 9, 2011, the Warriors waived Lin. He was a favorite of Lacob, but the Warriors were freeing up salary cap space to make an offer to restricted free agent center DeAndre Jordan; Lin was due to make almost $800,000 that would have become fully guaranteed on February 10, 2012. The San Francisco Chronicle said Lin would have had trouble beating out rookie guard Charles Jenkins.|$|E

500|$|With the {{withdrawal}} of Enterprise in early May, Saratoga became the only operational American fleet carrier in the South Pacific. Task Force 14, as her group was now known, was reinforced by the anti-aircraft cruiser [...] on 3 May and by the British fleet carrier [...] on 17 May. At this time Saratoga embarked 34 Wildcats of VF-5, 37 Dauntlesses of VB-3 and VS-3 and 16 Avengers of VT-8. Ramsey's force was intended to provide distant cover for the impending landings on New Georgia and to prevent intervention by any Japanese carriers. The two carriers spent some weeks familiarizing each other with their capabilities and tactics and Ramsey decided {{to take advantage of}} each carrier's strengths. He ordered that the Avengers of 832 Squadron be exchanged for 24 Wildcats from VF-3 as Victorious had difficulty operating the large Avenger and the British carrier possessed better facilities for coordinating fighter operations than Saratoga; the latter retained a dozen Wildcats for self-defense and escort duties. Fortunately, Ramsey <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> test his reorganization as the Japanese carriers made no effort to attack the American transports. Ramsey was relieved on 26 July and replaced by Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman. Victorious sailed on 31 July for home and left eleven Avengers behind as reserves for Saratoga.|$|E
500|$|Mullen has {{admitted}} his bass drum technique {{is not one}} of his strengths and has used a floor tom to his left to create the effect he wants (since The Unforgettable Fire era), using it for accents or in songs such as [...] "With or Without You", [...] "In God's Country", [...] "One" [...] and Pride (In the Name of Love)". Speaking in 1995, he said, [...] "When it came to recording 'Pride' for The Unforgettable Fire album, Danny [...] was able to pick up from me that I had some interesting ideas but here was a slight lack of focus. My kick drum technique was then, as it is now, completely underdeveloped and I <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> practice and learn like most people would. In the marching bands, I only used a snare and when I first got a kit, I never learned how to properly use all the elements together. So I went and listened to a basic demo of 'Pride' and tried to play a beat just using the kick and snare. But I couldn't get the kick to do what I wanted, so I got a floor tom down and did what I'd done in the past, which was if I couldn't physically do what was necessary, I'd find another way around it. I couldn't do what most people would consider a normal beat for the song, so I chose alternatives." ...|$|E

2500|$|Erwin's forces {{included}} the 12th Infantry, the 82nd Field Artillery, and the 2nd Cavalry Brigade, {{composed of the}} 5th Cavalry Regiment and the 7th Cavalry Regiment. Heavy skirmishing ensued and the Carrancistas returned to their fort so that only the Americans and the Villistas would be engaged. The 12th Infantry and the 2nd Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery, advanced {{through the center of}} Juarez while the 5th Cavalry and the 7th Cavalry were protecting the flanks. At 12:30 am, on June 16, the 1st Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery, opened fire from El Paso at the Villista-held Juarez Racetrack and continued pounding it effectively until 1:00 am, when the order to cease fire was given. By the time the bombardment was over, 1st Battalion had fired a total of 64 shrapnel rounds from two batteries. 3rd Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery, was in position and ready to fire but <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> engage.

At about 7:00 am, six miles southeast of Juarez, the Americans encountered a large force of Villistas, divided into three sections. The cavalry charged immediately, as well as the artillery, which was attached to horses. When the 2nd Battalion was 4,000 yards from the Villistas' position the troopers dismounted and the artillery pieces were brought to bear. The first salvo was a direct hit, shrapnel rounds wiped out one of the sections completely and forced the other two units to [...] "scatter in different directions."

At last, one day, when he was around hunting up bad little boys to admonish, he found a lot of them in the old iron-foundry fixing up a little joke on fourteen or fifteen dogs, which they had tied together in long procession, and were going to ornament with empty nitroglycerin cans made fast to their tails.

He sat down on one of those cans (for he never minded grease when duty was before him), and he took hold of the foremost dog by the collar, and turned his reproving eye upon wicked Tom Jones.
