40|$|NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is {{developing}} a new space-borne GPS receiver that can operate effectively in {{the full range of}} Earth orbiting missions from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to geostationary and beyond. Navigator is designed to be a fully space flight qualified GPS receiver optimized for fast signal acquisition and weak signal tracking. The fast acquisition capabilities provide exceptional time to first fix performance (TIFF) with no a priori receiver state or GPS almanac information, even in the presence of high Doppler shifts present in LEO (or near perigee in highly eccentric orbits). The fast acquisition capability also makes it feasible to implement extended correlation intervals and therefore significantly reduce <b>Navigator</b> <b>s</b> acquisition threshold. This greatly improves GPS observability when the receiver is above the GPS constellation (and satellites must be tracked from {{the opposite side of the}} Earth) by providing at least 10 dB of increased acquisition sensitivity. Fast acquisition and weak signal tracking algorithms have been implemented and validated on a hardware development board. A fully functional version of the receiver, employing most of the flight parts, with integrated navigation software is expected by mid 2005. An ultimate goal of this project is to license the Navigator design to an industry partner who will then market the receiver as a commercial product...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} current finding on {{truck driver}} average exposure to acceleration for several different manufacturer 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s cab-over trucks {{on a variety}} of roads in different countries. The predominant time, for this aspect of the study has been spent in the area around London, England and Warsaw, Poland. The ECE directive 2002 / 44 /EC has provided specific guidelines for vehicle operators 8 hour average acceleration exposure. The primary considerations have been on truck design including the air-ride driver 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 <b>s</b> <b>seat.</b> The truck manufacturers have produced truck cabs that have some separate suspension from the truck frame. The truck seat manufacturers have been producing air-ride suspension seats for the cab. Both of these designs have had the objective of meeting the ECE directive and providing the vehicle drivers with some degrees of comfort. This paper will provide some information on the ability of the vehicles to operate {{on a variety of}} roads and meet the objectives. Method The primary method for evaluation of the driver 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s exposure has been the use of a seat pad attached to the driver 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 <b>s</b> <b>seat.</b> Although this sensor system provides the critical information for the driver, an understanding {{of the reasons for the}} values requires additional measurements. The initial study in England used both driver and passenger seat pads, as shown in Figure 1, as well as triaxial accelerometers mounted on the base of the seat. The latest studies used significantly more transducers to better understand the relative rotations and translations on the truck frame, the cab, and the driver. [...|$|R
