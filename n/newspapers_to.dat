5|$|In 1995, as {{thousands}} {{of members of the}} church traveled to the Holy Supper celebration in Guadalajara, several members of a neighboring community supported by Cardinal Juan Sandoval Íñiguez protested the use of schools to provide temporary shelters for the Luz del Mundo pilgrims. The protesters said that after the ceremony the schools were left in disarray; however church authorities presented photographic evidence to <b>newspapers</b> <b>to</b> refute these claims.|$|E
5|$|Murdoch's {{previous}} {{foray into}} the sport was advising Amstrad chairman Alan Sugar to support Terry Venables's takeover bid for Tottenham Hotspur. The club, {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy, courted newspaper owner Robert Maxwell, someone whom Murdoch regarded as a threat. Murdoch chose not to make a bid for Tottenham himself, for conflict of interest reasons, and used his <b>newspapers</b> <b>to</b> create momentum in favour of Sugar.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the revelation}} of the illegal activities, {{expenditures}} had been routinely made on a cash basis, all of the university funding and program money was thrown into a single account, and university bond indentures had been violated. The new leadership had to advertise in Louisiana <b>newspapers</b> <b>to</b> find out to whom they owed money. The first year {{of dealing with the}} situation required 16- to 18-hour days, six days a week, and after that the process still required overtime through the year 1941.

5|$|Beginning at the post–World War I 1920 Summer Olympics, the {{lighting}} of the Olympic Flame {{was followed by}} the release of doves, symbolizing peace. (Experienced athletes brought <b>newspapers</b> <b>to</b> cover themselves because of the birds' droppings.) The release was discontinued after several doves perched themselves at the cauldron's rim and were burned alive in the Olympic Flame during the opening ceremony of the 1988 Summer Olympics. It was later replaced with a symbolic release of doves after the flame has been lit.|$|E
5|$|In August 1955, Leech set an Australian {{record of}} 1 minute 5.0 seconds for the 110-yard freestyle, before {{lowering}} it to 1 minute 4.8 seconds in October; this prompted <b>newspapers</b> <b>to</b> trumpet {{her as a}} prospect for the Melbourne Olympics. She did not {{get an opportunity to}} defend her Australian title in 1956 because she was hospitalised with illness. Leech recovered in time to win the national age title in the 100-metre freestyle in a time of 1 minute 4.6 seconds, just 0.1 of a second outside Dawn Fraser's world record. She then posted a time of 1 minute 4.6 seconds to defeat Fraser and Lorraine Crapp at another meeting in the following month.|$|E

For this purpose they employed the services of the political consultancy firm Harold Oram.|$|E

5|$|The {{courts have}} rarely treated {{content-based}} regulation of journalism with any sympathy. In Miami Herald Publishing Co. v.

The Supreme Court found that freedom, but not responsibility, is mandated by the First Amendment and so it ruled that the government may not force <b>newspapers</b> <b>to</b> publish that which they do not desire to publish.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{reaction}} of most Virginia politicians and <b>newspapers</b> <b>to</b> the Brown decision was restrained. From the 1920s {{to the late}} 1960s, Virginia politics had been dominated by the Byrd Organization, a political machine led by Senator Harry F. Byrd, Sr. (who was also a former governor of Virginia). Top leaders in the Byrd Organization, such as Governor Thomas B. Stanley and then-Attorney General James Lindsay Almond, Jr., were also at first reserved in their reaction to the Brown ruling.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} and the perceived conflict of interest faced by the baseball writers who scored games for MLB eventually led many major <b>newspapers</b> <b>to</b> end the practice for their employees. In 1958, The Washington Post prohibited their writers from scoring baseball games. Over {{the next two decades}} other major newspapers joined in the writer-scorer ban, including The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Boston Globe, and the major daily newspapers published in Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia. In 1980, MLB resolved the conflict by directly hiring official scorers for each stadium.|$|E
5|$|A Junkers F.13 {{called at}} Lympne on 10 January 1923 {{to clear customs}} and then flew to Croydon where it was {{inspected}} by Secretary of State for Air Sir Samuel Hoare. In February, {{it was reported that}} Lympne had taken part in a test of the newly introduced Mayday radio signal used by aircraft to indicate that they were in distress. Georges Barbot won a prize of F.25,000 from Le Matin when he made a flight from St Inglevert to Lympne and back again on the same day, 6 May. He flew the route in a Dewoitine aircraft fitted with a Clerget engine. On landing a bracing wire in the undercarriage of the aircraft broke, but repairs were effected within half an hour. Problems starting the engine then delayed his departure slightly. On 28 October the Light Aircraft Trials were held (see below). In 1923, Air Union started a service flying <b>newspapers</b> <b>to</b> Lympne using a Farman F.60 Goliath.|$|E

5|$|As a {{small but}} rapidly intensifying hurricane, Janet passed just south of Barbados on September22, {{becoming}} the first hurricane to strike the island in 57years, since the 1898 Windward Islands Hurricane. Maximum sustained winds {{on the south side}} of the island were estimated to be between 110–120mph (180–190km/h). The strong winds knocked out communication lines, preventing officials from accurately enumerating casualties on the island, though communications were still maintained by commercial cable companies and amateur radio. Electric power was later restored, allowing <b>newspapers</b> <b>to</b> publish information on the storm. Sugar cane, the island country's main source of revenue, was severely damaged, with losses estimated to be in excess of $1million. Poorly constructed dwellings were blown apart by the strong winds. An estimated 8,100homes were damaged by the hurricane. The destroyed buildings and trees blocked highways, and the Seawell Airport was forced to close. Heavy rains peaked at 4in (100mm) and a storm surge of 7ft (2.1m) swept away low-lying houses along the coast. An estimated 2,000people were left homeless due to the hurricane. Property damage on Barbados was estimated to be $5million, and at least 57people were killed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, MacArthur had {{attacked}} the imperial mystique when his staff released the famous {{picture of his}} first meeting with the Emperor, whose impact on the Japanese public was electric as the Japanese people for the first time saw the Emperor as a mere man overshadowed by the much taller MacArthur instead of the living god he had always been portrayed as. Up to 1945, the Emperor had been a remote, mysterious figure to his people, rarely seen in public and always silent, whose photographs were always taken from a certain angle to make him look taller and more impressive than he really was. No Japanese photographer would have taken such a photo of the Emperor being overshadowed by MacArthur. The Japanese government immediately banned the photo of the Emperor with MacArthur {{on the grounds that it}} damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese <b>newspapers</b> <b>to</b> print it. The photo was intended as a message to the Emperor about who was going to be the senior partner in their relationship.|$|E
