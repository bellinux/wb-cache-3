5|$|The {{remainder}} of Night describes Eliezer's efforts {{not to be}} parted from his father, not even {{to lose sight of}} him; his grief and shame at witnessing his father's decline into helplessness; and as their relationship changes and the young man becomes the older man's caregiver, his resentment and guilt, because his father's existence threatens his own. The stronger Eliezer's <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive,</b> the weaker the bonds that tie him to other people.|$|E
5|$|It is {{one thing}} to say that a bird has a {{property}} right in its nest, or that a wolf has a property right in its den – specific bits of territory used exclusively by one animal family. But the habitat that animals <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> extends far beyond such specific and exclusive bits of territory – animals often need to fly or roam over vast territories shared by many other animals. Protecting a bird’s nest is of little help if the nearby watering holes are polluted, or if tall buildings block its flight path. It’s not clear how ideas of property rights can help here.|$|E
5|$|About 1,150 {{species of}} fungi have been {{recorded}} from Antarctica, of which about 750 are non-lichen-forming and 400 are lichen-forming. Some of these species are cryptoendoliths {{as a result of}} evolution under extreme conditions, and have significantly contributed to shaping the impressive rock formations of the McMurdo Dry Valleys and surrounding mountain ridges. The apparently simple morphology, scarcely differentiated structures, metabolic systems and enzymes still active at very low temperatures, and reduced life cycles shown by such fungi make them particularly suited to harsh environments such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. In particular, their thick-walled and strongly melanised cells make them resistant to UV light. Those features can also be observed in algae and cyanobacteria, suggesting that these are adaptations to the conditions prevailing in Antarctica. This has led to speculation that, if life ever occurred on Mars, it might have looked similar to Antarctic fungi such as Cryomyces antarcticus, and Cryomyces minteri. Some of these fungi are also apparently endemic to Antarctica. Endemic Antarctic fungi also include certain dung-inhabiting species which have had to evolve in response to the double challenge of extreme cold while growing on dung, and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> passage through the gut of warm-blooded animals.|$|E

It {{was developed}} by Yoshio Kiya, who {{would go on to}} create the Dragon Slayer and Brandish series of action RPGs. While its RPG elements were limited, lacking traditional statistical or leveling systems, the game featured real-time combat with a gun, bringing it close to the action RPG formula that Falcom would later be known for. The game's desert island overworld also featured a day-night cycle, non-player characters the player could attack or converse with, and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> by finding and consuming rations to restore hit points lost with each normal action.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, {{poverty in}} Italy hit {{the high levels}} in the {{previous}} 10 years. The level of absolute poverty for a 2 people family was €1050,95/month. The poverty line per capita changed by region from €552,39/month to €819,13/month.The numbers of those in absolute poverty rose nearly an entire percent in 2015, from 6.8% in 2014, to 7.6% in 2015. In the south of Italy the numbers are even higher with 10% living in absolute poverty, up from 9 percent in 2014. The north is better off at 6.7%, but still an increase from 5.7% in 2014. The national statics reporting agency, ISTAT, defines absolute poverty as those who can’t buy goods and services which they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b> In 2015, the proportion of poor households in relative poverty also increased in 2015 to 13.7 from 12.9 in 2014. ISTAT defines relative poverty as people whose disposable income is less than around half the national average. The unemployment rate in February 2016 remained at 11.7%, {{which has been the}} same for almost a year, but even having a job doesn’t guarantee freedom from poverty. Those who have at least one family employed still suffer from 6.1% to 11.7% poverty, the higher number being for those who have factory jobs. The numbers are even higher for the younger generations because their unemployment rate is over 40%. Also, children are hit hard. In 2014, 32% of those aged 0–17 are at risk of poverty or social exclusion, which is one child out of three. In the last ISTAT report poverty is in decline.|$|E
500|$|According to the Catechism, theft or {{stealing}} means [...] "usurping another's property {{against the}} reasonable {{will of the}} owner" [...] though exclusion exists for someone in great <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b> [...] "Unjustly taking and keeping the property of others" [...] considered as theft, even if the act is {{outside the scope of}} civil law. Cardinal Christoph Schönborn gave example from the story of Saint Augustine, written in his Confessions, who took pears from neighbor's garden when he was young. Schönborn says that Augustine still has [...] "pangs of conscience over a childish theft" [...] even when he became grown person, indicating that human conscience is very aware of theft though the act perhaps not an offense against civil law.|$|E
500|$|As {{the release}} of the new album approached, the band and its {{management}} found {{that they would have to}} navigate changes in the music industry, which Hurley described as [...] "a completely different place." [...] Facing declining record sales, the lack of a proper outlet for exhibition of music videos, and the economic crisis, Hurley commented that [...] "people are buying things they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> rather than records and concert tickets." [...] The group's 2007 album Infinity on High sold one million copies, which was considered a disappointment compared to From Under the Cork Trees sales of three million. Trohman attributed this to [...] "the same reason that nobody's records are selling that well: there's so much turmoil in the music industry, so much downsizing, and people are finding different ways to get their music more and more all the time. There's very little we can do about that as a band. All we can do is try to make great music and hope it connects with people." ...|$|E

She commented that Angie [...] "is less of a housewife {{than the rest of}} them. She's a real broad." [...] However, de Matteo also noted that Angie is [...] "not just the brassy smart-talker" [...] and has a vulnerable side, which would be explored in the show. Cherry boosted Angie as [...] "a loving but tough Italian woman... who will do what she has to protect her family." [...] He also described her as [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "shielded," [...] which leaves her largely detached from the other women on the series. Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly described the character as [...] "icy." [...] Entertainment Weekly Tanner Stransky wrote that Angie was [...] "very real and very gritty," [...] noting that the character was capable [...] "of doing what they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive,</b> no matter what the price."

500|$|The Haitians at gravest risk {{of victimization}} by human traffickers are its poorest people, {{particularly}} children. In Haiti, the poorest {{country in the}} western hemisphere, over half the population lives on less than {{a dollar a day}} and over three quarters live on less than two dollars a day. [...] Severe poverty, compiled with a lack of social services such as education and basic healthcare increases a child’s vulnerability to modern slavery. [...] Factors that increase a child's likelihood of becoming a restavek include illness or loss of one or both parents, lack of access to clean water, lack of educational opportunities, and having access to family in a city. [...] In addition to poverty, individual factors that can lead to exploitation include unemployment, illiteracy, poor educational opportunities, a history of physical or sexual abuse, homelessness, and drug abuse. These individual factors “push” people towards pathways of human trafficking and modern day slavery. Oftentimes men, women and children accept slave-like work conditions because there is little hope for better and they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b> Some cross national borders in search of positive opportunities, but instead find themselves a part of the exploited work force. [...] Additionally, factors that make people easy targets for traffickers make enslavement more likely. [...] One group at high risk for sexual enslavement and other types of forced labor is internally displaced persons, particularly women and children living in refugee camps, [...] which offer little security. [...] The estimated 10% of undocumented Haitians, whose births go unreported, are at especial risk of enslavement.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rails and}} {{projectiles}} must be built from strong conductive materials; the rails <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> {{the violence of}} an accelerating projectile, and heating due to the large currents and friction involved. Some erroneous work {{has suggested that the}} recoil force in railguns can be redirected or eliminated; careful theoretical and experimental analysis reveals that the recoil force acts on the breech closure just as in a chemical firearm. The rails also repel themselves via a sideways force caused by the rails being pushed by the magnetic field, just as the projectile is. The rails <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> this without bending and must be very securely mounted. [...] Currently published material suggests that major advances in material science must be made before rails can be developed that allow railguns to fire more than a few full-power shots before replacement of the rails is required.|$|E

2500|$|Adorno {{argues that}} Marx {{explained}} convincingly why the appearance-form {{and the real}} nature of human relations often does not directly coincide, not {{on the strength of}} a metaphysical philosophy such as transcendental realism, but by inferring the social meaning of human relations from the way they observably appear in practical life – using systematic critical and logical thought as a tool of discovery. Every step in the analysis can be logically and empirically tested. The hermeneutic assumption is that these relations require shared meanings {{in order to be able}} to function and communicate at all. These shared presuppositions have an intrinsic rationality, because human behaviour – ultimately driven by the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> – is to a large extent purposive (teleological), and not arbitrary or random (though some of it may be). If the [...] "essential relationships" [...] never became visible or manifest in any way, no science would be possible at all, only speculative metaphysics. It is merely that sense data require correct interpretation – they do not have a meaning independently of their socially mediated interpretation. In that sense, the mask presupposes the existence of something which for the time being remains invisible, but which can be revealed when one discovers what is behind the mask. It may be that the essence suddenly reveals itself on the stage of history, or more simply that the understandings which one already has, are altered so that the essence of the thing is finally grasped.|$|E
