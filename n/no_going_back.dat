5|$|As a {{response}} to the cancellation, fans created online petitions, called Netflix, and tweeted #RenewSense8 and other hashtags, in an attempt to bring back the show. On June 8, 2017, the show's social media accounts acknowledged the fans' efforts, and wrote that Netflix looked into the renewal of Sense8 a second time, however they concluded it wasn't possible. Smith released a letter to the fans reiterating the reason for the cancellation was low viewership, and explaining that the reason he rallied them to voice their support before the show was officially cancelled, was that once that happens, there is <b>no</b> <b>going</b> <b>back.</b> He praised Netflix for their support while making the show, and thanked the fans for putting up a great fight to keep it alive. On June 10, 2017, Chief Content Officer of Netflix Ted Sarandos during his talk on Produced By Conference, explicitly commented the show was cancelled because its audience, despite being very passionate, wasn't large enough to support the high production costs to travel and film around the globe.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships which}} sail the {{southern}} sea {{and south of}} it are like houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky. Their rudders are several tens of feet long. A single ship carries several hundred men, and has in the stores a year's supply of grain. Pigs are fed and wine fermented on board. There is no account of dead or living, <b>no</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to the mainland when once the people have set forth upon the caerulean sea. At daybreak, when the gong sounds aboard the ship, the animals can drink their fill, and crew and passengers alike forget all dangers. To those on board everything is hidden and lost in space, mountains, landmarks, and the countries of foreigners. The shipmaster may say 'To make such and such a country, with a favourable wind, in so many days, we should sight such and such a mountain, (then) the ship must steer in such and such a direction'. But suddenly the wind may fall, {{and may not be}} strong enough to allow of the sighting of the mountain on the given day; in such a case, bearings may have to be changed. And the ship (on the other hand) may be carried far beyond (the landmark) and may lose its bearings. A gale may spring up, the ship may be blown hither and thither, it may meet with shoals or be driven upon hidden rocks, then it may be broken to the very roofs (of its deckhouses). A great ship with heavy cargo has nothing to fear from the high seas, but rather in shallow water it will come to grief.|$|E

It's a slow and steady build, but once it reaches that Journey-esque chorus ("I don't want to be alone forever, but I can be... TONIGHT!", there's <b>no</b> <b>going</b> <b>back.</b> Cue the endless {{intercontinental}} shout-outs at the end ("I don't speak German, but I try!"

500|$|As the Basketmaker III people {{improved}} their farming techniques during the 8th century, the well-watered {{areas of the}} San Juan Basin became densely populated. Greater crop yields necessitated the construction of above-ground storage facilities, which were the first large-scale construction projects in the region. Fagan identifies this {{as the beginning of}} the first pueblos, [...] "ushering in a period of profound social tension, population movements, and political change." [...] In his opinion, [...] "by 800, there was <b>no</b> <b>going</b> <b>back.</b> The people of Chaco and elsewhere were locked completely into economies based on maize and bean cultivation." [...] Archeologists refer to the period starting [...] as the Pueblo I Period. By the early 10th century the large pit-house settlements had been supplanted by modular construction that later served as the foundation for the Ancestral Puebloan great houses. This marks the beginning of the Bonito Phase. During the 10th century, Chaco's population was swelled by a steady influx of immigrants from the San Juan River, approximately [...] north. Fagan notes, [...] "Within a few centuries, as rainfall became more irregular and life less predictable, the Chacoans embarked on a cultural trajectory that melded ancient traditions with new ideas that were to crystalize into a brilliant and short-lived Southwestern society." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{enhanced}} TV {{coverage in}} 1994 {{was a crucial}} factor in ensuring that Orbital's performance at the festival achieved legendary status. As a result of Channel 4's coverage, living rooms across the country were able to experience what a rave might look like, and suddenly dance music – which had been attacked by the establishment and mainstream press for years – didn't seem so dangerous. Indeed, 1994 was a crucial turning point for dance music's role at the festival. Speaking to The Guardian in 2013 about the Orbital gig, Michael Eavis noted that it marked dance music's appearance on the mainstream agenda. [...] "What was previously underground made it on {{to one of the}} big stages, and there was <b>no</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> from there. As the police and the council made me very well aware, the buzz had been around the raves and the market sound systems and in the travellers' fields for years. But it needed a showcase to make it legal." [...] The gig opened the way for others such as the Chemical Brothers, Massive Attack and Underworld, who all played high-profile stages in the following years – developments that led to the launch of the festival's Dance Village in 1997.|$|E

Israel should {{withdraw}} to {{the borders of}} the UN Partition Plan — Israel argued [...] "that the new borders—which could be changed, under consent only—had been established as a result of war, and because the UN blueprint took no account of defense needs and was militarily untenable, there was <b>no</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to that blueprint." ...|$|E

In April 2013 Saunders said on the Alan Carr Chatty Man show that she had doubts about the film as she felt the cast were [...] "too old". She felt pressure to write it and didn't want to commit herself to it at this early stage.|$|E

A tour in support of the album kicked off in the spring of 2014 and included dates in the U.S. on the Summer Nationals tour which features The Offspring, Bad Religion, The Vandals, Pennywise and Naked Raygun. The album was the band's first U.K. chart success since 1983's [...] "All The Best" [...] and their first ever number 1 record on the BBC Rock Album Chart.|$|E

2500|$|Crucially, {{intensive}} TV broadcasting {{from the}} Glastonbury Festival in 1994 meant that Orbital's set reached a huge audience. Speaking to The Guardian in 2013 about the gig, Paul Hartnoll commented: [...] "I didn't {{know how much}} of an impact it would have. Being young myself, I just thought, 'It's about time – of course we should have acid house at Glastonbury'. It used to annoy me. I just used to think it should be happening."

Snowden said, [...] "There's no saving an intelligence community that believes it can lie to the public and the legislators who {{need to be able to}} trust it and regulate its actions. Seeing that really meant for me there was <b>no</b> <b>going</b> <b>back.</b> Beyond that, it was the creeping realization that no one else was going to do this. The public had a right to know about these programs." [...] In March 2014, Snowden stated that he had reported policy or legal issues related to spying programs to more than ten officials, but as a contractor had no legal avenue to pursue further whistleblowing. In May 2014, Vanity Fair reported that Snowden first contemplated leaking confidential documents around 2008 but held back, partly because he believed the newly elected Barack Obama might introduce reforms.|$|E
