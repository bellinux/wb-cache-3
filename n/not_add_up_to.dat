25|$|Einstein's {{theory of}} general {{relativity}} shows that the true geometry of spacetime is not Euclidean geometry. For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles do <b>not</b> <b>add</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and such considerations are now {{an integral part of}} the software that runs the GPS system. It is possible to object to this interpretation {{of general relativity}} on the grounds that light rays might be improper physical models of Euclid's lines, or that relativity could be rephrased so as to avoid the geometrical interpretations. However, one of the consequences of Einstein's theory is that there is no possible physical test that can distinguish between a beam of light as a model of a geometrical line and any other physical model. Thus, the only logical possibilities are to accept non-Euclidean geometry as physically real, or to reject the entire notion of physical tests of the axioms of geometry, which can then be imagined as a formal system without any intrinsic real-world meaning.|$|E

40|$|With {{seasonal}} adjustment {{one has to}} decide whether to seasonal adjust an aggregate like GDP directly or <b>to</b> sum <b>up</b> its seasonally adjusted components. This choice is usually driven by subjective motives or practical convenience. In the case of {{seasonal adjustment}} with chain-linked data one might feel forced to use the direct approach as components do <b>not</b> even <b>add</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> aggregates before the adjustment. This paper presents a guide for practitioners, which recommends a more objective way of decision-making, based on several indicators. It proposes some of these criteria which can facilitate the decision between the direct and the indirect approach. For the case of chain-linked series, where the indirect approach seems not to be feasible because components are <b>not</b> <b>adding</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> an aggregate, the paper presents a method how the indirect approach of seasonal adjustment nevertheless can be applied. Finally it deals with a possible balancing process between the results of the direct and the indirect approach and a practical application example is given...|$|R

40|$|Laser {{has become}} {{in the recent}} years an {{important}} therapeutic tool for treating esophageal cancer in a palliative setting aiming to reopen the tumor stenosis. The literature shows that the initial enthusiasm for laser, compared with other methods [...] especially endoprosthesis [...] has somewhat been tempered because the success rate in restoring a normal food intake was lower than expected (65 - 68 %). Although the complication rate is low, repeated therapy sessions are needed to maintain the lumen open. This constitutes a major drawback in terms of patient acceptability. Variations in the therapeutical methods (contact laser, photodynamic therapy, [...] .) have <b>not</b> <b>added</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> now significant value to laser therapy.

2500|$|Like other {{bishops of}} Brechin, Forrester {{does not seem}} to have been very active in his diocese, on several {{occasions}} obtaining papal indults legitimizing procurations without visitation. He is recorded presiding over statutes issued by his cathedral chapter in 1410, and later in the year pursued land claims successfully with the support of Governor Albany and his sheriff in Angus. Albany granted him the second tenth of crown revenues from the sheriffdom of Kincardine in 1413 and 1417. He was present at a provincial council of the Scottish church at Perth on 16 July 1419. Historian D. E. R.

2500|$|Gordon's {{work has}} been {{generally}} well received by the critics and the public, although his piece Field, Chair and Mountain for American Ballet Theater, his first ballet, was reportedly booed at its premiere at the Kennedy Center Opera House in Washington, D.C. in 1985. The critical response was more generous, calling it [...] "remarkable", [...] "irreverent and clever", [...] "a mesmerizing exploration of partnering", and [...] "one {{of the most beautiful}} and distinctive [...] in ABT's current repertory", and praising Gordon's [...] "deadpan humor and ... obvious nostalgic affection for things romantic", and his [...] "energy and wit". However, Arlene Croce in The New Yorker said that the ballet was [...] "the kind of folly that advances to the limit of frivolity on the strength of passion," [...] and in The New York Times, Anna Kisselgoff wrote that [...] "Despite [...] original aspects, [...] "Field, Chair and Mountain" [...] does <b>not</b> <b>add</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> anything beyond its isolated parts.

5000|$|In the Western Catholic Church, the {{obligation}} to fast no longer applies to all weekdays of Lent (40 days), but only to Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. In the tradition {{of this part of}} the Catholic Church, abstinence from eating some form of food (generally meat, but not dairy or fish products) is distinguished from fasting. Fasting involves having during the day only one proper meal with <b>up</b> <b>to</b> two [...] "collations", light meatless meals sufficient to maintain strength but <b>not</b> <b>adding</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the equivalent of a full meal. In principle, abstinence is to be observed on Ash Wednesday and on every Friday of the year that is not a solemnity (a liturgical feast day of the highest rank); but in each country the episcopal conference can determine the form it is to take, perhaps replacing abstinence with other forms of penance.|$|R

40|$|An {{abundance}} of comparative survey research has established {{the presence of}} economic voting as a individual force in European elections. But the hypothesis of economic voting at the aggregate level, with macroeconomics influencing overall electoral outcomes, rests on shakier ground. Indeed, {{there might be a}} micrological fallacy at work, with the individual economic vote effect <b>not</b> <b>adding</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a national electoral effect after all. We examine this possibility through rigorous analysis of a large time-series cross-sectional data-set of European nations. From these results, it becomes clear that the macroeconomy moves national election outcomes, with hard times punishing governing parties, and good times rewarding them. Then the question is whether this economy-election connection alters with economic crisis. We show that in general economic crisis, defined as negative growth, reinforces the national economic vote, especially in the hard-pressed nations of Southern Europe. In these nations under crisis, the ruling parties are held still more accountable at the ballot box, when compared to their Northern European counterparts. status: publishe...|$|R
