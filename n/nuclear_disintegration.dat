25|$|The {{discovery}} of the neutron immediately gave scientists a new tool for probing the properties of atomic nuclei. Alpha particles had been used over the previous decades in scattering experiments, but such particles, which are helium nuclei, have +2 charge. This charge {{makes it difficult for}} alpha particles to overcome the Coulomb repulsive force and interact directly with the nuclei of atoms. Since neutrons have no electric charge, {{they do not have to}} overcome this force to interact with nuclei. Almost coincident with its discovery, neutrons were used by Norman Feather, Chadwick's colleague and protege, in scattering experiments with nitrogen. Feather was able to show that neutrons interacting with nitrogen nuclei scattered to protons or induced nitrogen to disintegrate to form boron with the emission of an alpha particle. Feather was therefore the first to show that neutrons produce <b>nuclear</b> <b>disintegrations.</b>|$|R

The next question might be, when is energy considered ''high?'' To discuss this, we need a scale for measuring particle energies, and some feeling for the meaning of magnitudes on this scale. The basic scale unit is the ''electron volt'', which is the amount of energy acquired by a particle bearing an electric charge equal to that of an electron, when it falls through an electrical potential difference of one volt.
