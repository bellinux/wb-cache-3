40|$|Trait {{and state}} {{negative}} affect {{contribute to the}} development and maintenance of psychopathology, though the mechanisms through which they exert their effects remain unclear. The present study was motivated by the hypothesis that attentional-control deficits will help to understand the biological and psychological mechanisms involved in the potentially distinct contributions that trait and state <b>NA</b> <b>make</b> in initiating and maintaining mental disorders. Brain activation associated with trait and state negative affect was measured by fMRI during performance of an emotion-word Stroop task. Trait negative affect was associated with reduced activity in areas involved in top-down, goal-directed attentional control. In contrast, state negative affect was associated with more activity in regions involved in bottom-up, stimulus-driven attentional control. Present results suggest that these two emotional facets are associated with distinct attentional control deficits, which has implications for the prevention and treatment of psychological disorders...|$|E

Participants were 82 families with a child aged 2 - 7 years. There were significant differences between the CA and NA mothers 2 ̆ 7 anger- intensifying attributional style for both negative and ambiguous negative child behaviour and anger-justifying attributions for negative parenting behaviour. The CA mothers reported an elevated level of anger-intensifying attributional style where the CA group tended to attribute negative and ambiguous negative child behaviour to internal and stable causes in the child and rated the behaviour as more intentional and blameworthy. CA mothers {{were also more likely to}} attribute blame to their child for their own negative parenting behaviour and perceive the reason for their behaviour was unlikely to change and that their behaviour was part of their personality (e. g. "That 2 ̆ 7 s the way I am. I yell and hit my children").

For these reasons, many investigatorshave often tried {{to look at the}} possibility of generatinga universal vaccine useful against more than oneinfluenza strain. The objective of research was toobtain an alternative antigen as vaccine candidatefor universal flu vaccination, instead of HA and NAcomponents. In this study, we use conserved epitopeM 2 e which is consist of three major componentsuch as N-terminal M 2 e 2 - 24 (24 amino acids),transmembrane(59 amino acids) and C-terminal (19 amino acids). We design two components of antigen,linier and branched structures. The antigens thenformulated with aluminium hydroxide gel comparedto FCA/IFA adjuvant.

NAs are predominantly women who earn a low wage and report financial, work, and family demands. Working as a NA is hazardous; this manuscript specifically examines the biological/infectious, chemical, enviromechanical, physical and psychosocial hazards that appear in the literature to date. A focused search strategy was used to review literature about hazards that fell into each of the five aforementioned domains. While some hazards that were documented were clear, such as exposure to influenza because of close contact with patients (biological/infectious), or exposure to hazardous drugs (chemical), literature was limited. The majority of the literature we reviewed fell into the domain of psychosocial hazards and centered on stress from workplace organization issues (such as mandatory overtime, lack of managerial support, and feeling rushed). More research is needed to understand which hazards NAs identify as most concerning and tailored interventions are needed for risk mitigation...|$|R

40|$|When {{analyzing}} pathogen transcriptomes {{during the}} infection of host cells, the signal-to-background (pathogen-to-host) ratio of nucleic acids (NA) in infected samples is very small. Despite the advancements in next-generation sequencing, the minute amount of pathogen <b>NA</b> <b>makes</b> standard RNA-seq library preps inadequate for effective gene-level {{analysis of the}} pathogen in cases with low bacterial loads. In order {{to provide a more}} complete picture of the pathogen transcriptome during an infection, we developed a novel pathogen enrichment technique, which can enrich for transcripts from any cultivable bacteria or virus, using common, readily available laboratory equipment and reagents. To evenly enrich for pathogen transcripts, we generate biotinylated pathogen-targeted capture probes in an enzymatic process using the entire genome of the pathogen as a template. The capture probes are hybridized to a strand-specific cDNA library generated from an RNA sample. The biotinylated probes are captured on a monomeric avidin resin in a miniature spin column, and enriched pathogen-specific cDNA is eluted following a series of washes. To test this method, we performed an in vitro time-course infection using Klebsiella pneumoniae to infect murine macrophage cells. K. pneumoniae transcript enrichment efficiency was evaluated using RNA-seq. Bacterial transcripts were enriched up to ~ 400 -fold, and allowed the recovery of transcripts from ~ 2000 - 3600 genes not observed in untreated control samples. These additional transcripts revealed interesting aspects of K. pneumoniae biology including the expression of putative virulence factors and the expression of several genes responsible for antibiotic resistance {{even in the absence of}} drugs...|$|R

There are two basic ways to make chain complexes from a simplicial abelian group (or simplicial R-module) A: 1) The Moore complex, which is again denoted by A, has n-chains given by An, n ≥ 0, and has boundary maps ∂ = n ∑ i= 0 (− 1) i di: An → An− 1 defined by alternating sums of face homomorphisms. 2) The normalized chain complex NA has and has boundary NAn = n− 1 ⋂ i= 0 ker(di) ∂ = (− 1) n dn: NAn → NAn− 1. 1 To see that the definition of ∂ for the normalized complex <b>NA</b> <b>makes</b> sense and that ∂ 2 = 0, observe that didn(a) = dn− 1 di(a) for i ≤ n − 1.

We investigate the influence of polymer chain length, salt concentration, and cation type. We find that the neutron data and MD data for pure PEO agree very well. A relatively small concentration of dissolved salt (1 metal ion per 15 monomers) leads to a slowing down of the segmental motions by an order of magnitude. Here, the MD simulations agree qualitatively. Increasing the chain length from 23 to 182 monomers has no significant effect except at the highest salt concentration.
