5|$|Kecal summons {{the villagers}} {{to witness the}} {{contract}} he has made ("Come inside and listen to me"). He reads the terms: Mařenka is to marry <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>but</b> Mícha's son. Krušina and the crowd marvel at Jeník's apparent self-denial, but the mood changes when they learn {{that he has been}} paid off. The Act ends with Jenik being denounced by Krušina {{and the rest of the}} assembly as a rascal.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kecal is {{attempting}} to buy Jeník off, and after some verbal fencing makes a straight cash offer: a hundred florins if Jeník will renounce Mařenka. Not enough, is the reply. When Kecal increases the offer to 300florins, Jeník pretends to accept, but imposes a condition – <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>but</b> Mícha's son {{will be allowed to}} wed Mařenka. Kecal agrees, and rushes off to prepare the contract. Alone, Jeník ponders the deal he has apparently made to barter his beloved ("When you discover whom you've bought"), wondering how anyone could believe that he would really do this, and finally expressing his love for Mařenka.|$|E

The gloves came {{smoothly}} off, {{the rings}} went smoothly on; <b>no</b> <b>one</b> cried <b>but</b> Prue, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> laughed <b>but</b> Tilly; the brides were admired, the grooms envied; the service pronounced impressive, {{and when it}} ended, a tumult of congratulations arose.|$|R

5|$|Monarchs often pledged various {{items of}} state regalia as {{collateral}} for loans throughout the Middle Ages. At {{some point in}} the 14thcentury, all of the state regalia were moved to the White Tower at the Tower of London due to a series of successful and attempted thefts in a part of Westminster Abbey that housed state regalia. The holy relics of the coronation regalia stayed behind intact at the Abbey. Arches topped with a monde and cross were added to images of StEdward's Crown by the time of HenryIV and to the state crown during the reign of his successor HenryV. Known as a closed or imperial crown, the arches symbolised the king's pretensions of being an emperor of his own domain, subservient to <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>but</b> God, unlike some continental rulers who owed fealty to more powerful kings or the Holy Roman Emperor.|$|E
25|$|The {{fight is}} not for us, not for our {{personal}} wants and needs. It is for every animal that has ever suffered and died in the vivisection labs, and for every animal that will suffer and die in those same labs unless we end this evil business now. The souls of the tortured dead cry out for justice, the cry of the living is for freedom. We can create that justice and we can deliver that freedom. The animals have <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>but</b> us. We will not fail them.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the script}} was well {{received}} by the officials at Tallinnfilm, it was the consensus that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>but</b> Tarkovsky {{would be able to}} direct it. The script was sent to Goskino in February 1976, and although approval was granted for proceeding with making the film the screenplay was never realized. In 1984, during the time of his exile in the West, Tarkovsky revisited the screenplay and made a few changes. He also considered to finally direct a film based on the screenplay but ultimately dropped this idea.|$|E

Even so, his appointment did not go down well with many of his fellow architects who considered that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>but</b> Utzon should complete the Sydney Opera House. Upon Utzon's dismissal, a rally of protest had marched to Bennelong Point. A petition was also circulated, including in the Government Architects office.

He {{receives}} this from Hagrid as a 17th birthday present. Harry uses the pouch {{throughout the course of}} Deathly Hallows to keep several sentimental (yet, as he himself admits, otherwise worthless) objects such as the Marauder's Map, a shard of the magical mirror given to him by his god-father Sirius, the fake Horcrux locket that had belonged to Sirius's brother R.A.B (Regulus Arcturus Black), the Snitch bequeathed to him by Dumbledore, containing the Resurrection Stone that had previously been set into Voldemort's grandfather Marvolo Gaunt's signet ring, which Harry discovers is actually the second Hallow, a letter from his mother to Sirius with part of a photo (of him and his father, James), and eventually, his own broken wand (which Harry later repairs with the Elder Wand).|$|E

500|$|The {{response}} to these parodies has been mixed in the Tintinological community. Many despise them, seeing them as an affront to Hergé's work. Nick Rodwell of the Hergé Foundation took this view, declaring that [...] "None of these copyists count as true fans of Hergé. If they were, they would respect his wishes that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>but</b> him draw Tintin's adventures." [...] Where possible, the foundation has taken legal action against those known to be producing such items. Others have taken a different attitude, considering such parodies and pastiches to be tributes to Hergé, and collecting them has become a [...] "niche specialty".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Applause" [...] {{is about}} how Gaga is {{dependent}} upon her fan's adoration, while also serving as [...] "a kiss-off to critics". Bradley Stern of MuuMuse opined that [...] "Unlike 'Born This Way', 'Applause' is about celebrating <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>but</b> Mother Monster herself". According to Gaga, the song's lyrics highlight {{the difference between an}} artist and a celebrity. She elaborated, [...] "I live for the applause but I don't live for the attention in the way that people just love you because you're famous. I live for actually performing for people and then them applauding because they've been entertained." ...|$|E

The couple spent several years living in Tanganyika Territory and Macedonia before returning to England in 1929. After her novel These Old Shades became popular despite its release during the General Strike, Heyer determined that publicity was not necessary for good sales. For {{the rest of her}} life, she refused to grant interviews, telling a friend: [...] "My private life concerns <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>but</b> myself and my family." ...|$|E

As a result of the new variety of his repertoire, Williams {{published}} his first song book, Original Songs of Hank Williams. The book only listed lyrics, since its main purpose was to attract more audience. It included ten songs: [...] "Mother Is Gone", [...] "Won't You Please Come Back", [...] "My Darling Baby Girl" [...] (with Audrey Sheppard), [...] "Grandad's Musket", [...] "I Just Wish I Could Forget", [...] "Let's Turn Back the Years", [...] "Honkey-Tonkey", [...] "I Loved <b>No</b> <b>One</b> <b>But</b> You", [...] "A Tramp on the Street", and [...] "You'll Love Me Again". Williams became recognized as a songwriter, Sheppard became his manager and occasionally accompanied him on duets in some of his live concerts.|$|E
500|$|Now {{my great}} plan, which was {{conceived}} of old, ... {{is to let}} nothing be wilfully left unexamined.
