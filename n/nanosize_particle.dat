NP had the strongest inhibitory effect against all tested bacteria (8. 3 mm) followed by FP (7. 5 mm) while CP (6. 7 mm) showed the weakest maximum inhibition zone respectively (p < 0. 05). However, ginger rhizome water extract at all particle sizes were found not to inhibit yeast and mold. <b>Nanosize</b> <b>particle</b> of ginger rhizome water extract able to inhibit bacteria better than the CP and FP. Hence it is suggested that <b>nanosize</b> <b>particle</b> ginger rhizome water extract has the potential to be used as antibacterial agent in food and pharmaceutical industry...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{effects of}} {{surfactant}} composition and concentration on shape, size, zeta potential, and photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 <b>nanosized</b> <b>particles</b> are reported. Spherical, cubic, rod, ellipse and leaf-like shaped TiO 2 <b>nanosized</b> <b>particles</b> were obtained {{with the addition}} of different surfactants in various composition and concentrations during preparation. The results show that the shape and size of the TiO 2 <b>nanosized</b> <b>particles</b> depend on not only surfactant composition but also surfactant concentration. The pH dependence of zeta potential of TiO 2 <b>nanosized</b> <b>particles</b> was studied. A unique finding is that TiO 2 <b>nanosized</b> <b>particles</b> shaped by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) have two isoelectric points (IEPs), while other shape-controlled TiO 2 <b>nanosized</b> <b>particles</b> have only one IEP.

We report a novel strategy for designing {{a new class of}} HEAs incorporating the additional interstitial element carbon. This results in joint activation of twinning- and transformation-induced plasticity (TWIP and TRIP) by tuning the matrix phase’s instability in a metastable TRIP-assisted dual-phase HEA.

The particle production system is applied with the CVD method. In this method, liquid precursors are supplied directly to vacuum chamber by an injector and the particle is produced by flame thermal.

40|$|In {{order to}} develop {{appropriate}} countermeasures for NASA's return mission to the moon, the potential toxicity of lunar dust needs to be examined. Due to its abrasiveness, reactivity, composition and small size, lunar dust may pose a serious health risk to astronauts who inhale it. This project focuses on the toxicity of lunar dust simulant (JSC- 1 A-vf) using WI- 38 human embryonic lung cells. Past {{results show that the}} simulant has toxic effects on small animals using intratracheal instillation. Earlier studies in this lab suggest that the dust remaining in media after low speed centrifugation is toxic. In order to better assess its toxicity, the simulant has been diluted in media, filtered with a 5 micron filter before combining it with media. This filtered dust is compared with dust centrifuged in media. Whole dust toxicity is also tested. Toxicity is estimated using a 3 -(4, 5 -Dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) toxicity test which measures the activity of reducing enzymes in the mitochondria of viable cells. Preliminary results suggest that simulant which is diluted in media at different concentrations is slightly toxic. Interestingly, the cells appear to sweep up and collect the simulant. Whether this contributes to its toxicity is unclear.

40|$|Brush {{scrubbers}} {{are among}} the most commonly used instruments for wafer-cleaning applications nowadays. However, the removal mechanisms of <b>nanosized</b> <b>particles</b> are far from clear, especially because no direct experimental data are available to backup theoretical models in the literature. This study combines a theoretical approach based on a force analysis with an experimental study of the removal of <b>nanosized</b> slurry <b>particles.</b> In the theoretical part, all forces affecting the adhesion and the removal of particles are evaluated to determine which are dominant in two extreme removal mechanisms: lifting and rolling. In the experimental part, the removal efficiency of 34 nm SiO 2 particles is investigated by using the haze approach. Based on a study of the aging of contaminated wafers, conditions are selected where no chemical bonds are formed between a particle and a substrate. Force analysis and experimental observations both show that <b>nanosized</b> <b>particles</b> cannot be lifted directly by a brush. Instead, rolling should be the main particle-removal mechanism. The average fluid film thickness between brush and wafer surface is determined based on power measurements of the brush motor and a friction analysis, indicating that the system is in a hydrodynamic lubrication regime across a wafer in average. In this frame, results also show that the hydrodynamic drag force is the dominant removal force for <b>nanosized</b> <b>particles.</b> (C) 2004 American Vacuum Society. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|A deeper {{understanding}} of how the physical properties of particles regulate specific biological responses is becoming a crucial requirement for their successful biomedical application. To provide insights on their design and application, J 774 A. 1 cells are exposed to particles with different diameters (430 nm, 1. 9 mu m and 4. 8 mu m), and the size effects on a series of cellular responses in macrophages are evaluated. Cellular uptake study demonstrates that <b>nanosized</b> <b>particles</b> accumulate in the cells at a faster rate, and with a higher surface area. Once the data are converted into the expression of particle volume, the maximum value is found with 1. 9 mu m particles instead of nanoparticles. Moreover, the uptake intermediates are also trapped, and the steps of particle internalization include filopodia sensing, skeleton rearrangement, and morphology change. Subsequent cellular trafficking reveals that only <b>nanosized</b> <b>particles</b> transport via lysosomal pathway, which is consistent with their uptake mechanisms. Furthermore, <b>nanosized</b> <b>particles</b> prefer to promote the secretion of Th 1 -specific molecule signals (e. g. IFN, IL- 12) rather than immune suppressors.
