5|$|George and {{his father}} sailed for England from The Hague on 16/27 September 1714 and arrived at Greenwich two days later. The {{following}} day, they formally entered London in a ceremonial procession. George was given the title of Prince of Wales. Caroline followed her husband to Britain in October with their daughters, while Frederick remained in Hanover to be brought up by private tutors. London was like nothing George had seen before: it was 50 times larger than Hanover, and the crowd was estimated at up to {{one and a half}} million spectators. George courted popularity with voluble expressions of praise for the English, and claimed that he had <b>no</b> <b>drop</b> of blood that was not English.|$|E

25|$|In 2016, Carenza Lewis {{reported}} {{the results of}} a new method of assessing the death toll. She argues that pottery before and after the Black Death is datable because there was a change at that time from the high medieval to the late medieval style, and that counts of pottery of each type therefore provide a useful proxy for long term changes in population. She and her colleagues analysed pottery sherds from test pits in over fifty continuously occupied rural settlements in eastern England, and found a {{decline in the number of}} pottery producing pits of 45%. Norfolk had the greatest drop of 65%, while there was <b>no</b> <b>drop</b> in 10% of settlements, mostly commercial centres.|$|E

500|$|Josephson was 22 {{years old}} when he did the work on quantum {{tunnelling}} that won him the Nobel Prize. He discovered that a supercurrent could tunnel through a thin barrier, predicting, according to physicist Andrew Whitaker, that [...] "at a junction of two superconductors, a current will flow even if there is <b>no</b> <b>drop</b> in voltage; that when there is a voltage drop, the current should oscillate at a frequency related to the drop in voltage; {{and that there is a}} dependence on any magnetic field." [...] This became known as the Josephson effect and the junction as a Josephson junction.|$|E
500|$|Himmler's racial groupings {{began with}} the Volksliste, the {{classification}} of people deemed of German blood. These included Germans who had collaborated with Germany before the war, but also those who considered themselves German but had been neutral; those who were partially [...] "Polonized" [...] but [...] "Germanizable"; and Germans who were of Polish nationality. Himmler ordered that those who refused to be classified as ethnic Germans should be deported to concentration camps, have their children taken away, or be assigned to forced labour. Himmler's belief that [...] "it is {{in the nature of}} German blood to resist" [...] led to his conclusion that Balts or Slavs who resisted Germanization were racially superior to more compliant ones. He declared that <b>no</b> <b>drop</b> of German blood would be lost or left behind to mingle with an [...] "alien race".|$|E
