50|$|At {{close of}} nominations, {{there had been}} 15 contenders, with rival {{candidates}} for the 'Social & Liberal Democrats' and 'Continuing Social Democratic Party'. However, the SDP candidate, Tom Edwards, withdrew his candidature before the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>poll.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{geographical}} distance between candidate and voter on vote likelihood in the UK is essentially untested. In systems where constituency representatives vie for local inhabitants’ support in elections, candidates living {{closer to a}} voter {{would be expected to}} have a greater probability of receiving that individual’s support, other things being equal. In this paper, we present a first test of this concept using constituency data (specifically, <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>poll</b> address data) from the British General Election of 2010 and the British Election Survey, together with geographical data from Ordnance Survey and Royal Mail, to test the hypothesis that candidate distance matters in voters ’ choice of candidate. Using a conditional logit model, we find that the distance between voter and candidates from the three main parties (Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat) matters in English constituencies, even when controlling for strong predictors of vote-choice, such as party feeling and incumbency advantage...|$|E
40|$|Julia Gillard’s prime ministership {{was under}} {{relentless}} pressure {{during the entire}} first half <b>of</b> 2013. Opinion <b>polls</b> did not markedly improve for her government and dissatisfaction remained pronounced with her performance as prime minister. Her ministers began to lose confidence in her stoic leadership; caucus became increasingly nervous as the election drew closer; and the media were incessantly critical of her performance, especially the metropolitan tabloids. Some sections of the media even began to publish a regular “Ruddwatch” to monitor the every move the former PM made, likening it to a cat stalking its ill-fated prey. To make matters worse, Gillard’s party colleagues repeatedly questioned her political judgment, especially after she announced on 30 January that the next federal election would be held on 14 September 2013, giving over seven months’ <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the <b>poll</b> and throwing away one of the tactical advantages of incumbency. The plan was cooked up in her private office and she apparently had not told her cabinet colleagues...|$|R
5|$|If, on {{nomination}} day, {{there are}} two or more candidates nominated for election, the returning officer must immediately adjourn the election so that a poll can be taken.

50|$|The Register is {{published}} {{every year on}} 1 December after the annual canvass period (unless {{there has been an}} election during the annual canvass period between 1 July and 1 December, in which case the publication date is 1 February in the following year). However, in 2012, because the Police and Crime Commissioner elections were held on 15 November, the annual canvass in England and Wales (excluding London) was held between July and October and the Electoral Register was published on 16 October. Between January and September, during the 'rolling registration' period, <b>notices</b> <b>of</b> alteration are published on the first working day of each month to add, remove or amend names. <b>Notices</b> <b>of</b> alteration are also published 5 working days before an election at any time of the year and just before the close <b>of</b> <b>poll</b> at any election to correct any clerical errors or to implement any court decisions. With the exception of a deceased elector who is removed from the Register, any individual who is added or removed from the Register must be notified by the Electoral Registration Officer.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} role of {{emotions}} in the (bandwagon) effect <b>of</b> opinion <b>polls</b> on vote choice.

Furthermore, the effect <b>of</b> <b>polls</b> on vote choice is found to be a consequence <b>of</b> how these <b>polls</b> are presented in the media.
