Since ancient times, honey has been used successfully for treatment of broad spectrum of infections with no risk of resistance development. In this study, we investigated the antibacterial activity of two <b>natural</b> <b>honeys,</b> namely honeydew and manuka, against 20 nosocomial multi-drug resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia) isolates from cancer patients. Antibiotic susceptibility test was carried out using disk diffusion method with 20 antibiotic disks. The antibacterial activity of honey was determined using a broth dilution method. The concentration of honey used in study was {{within the range of}} 3. 75 % to 25 % (w/v). All 20 clinical isolates were multi-drug resistant against 11 to 19 antibiotics. The MICs for honeydew honey ranged from 6. 25 % to 17. 5 %, while those for active manuka honey ranged from 7. 5 % to 22. 5 %. Honeydew honey had the lower MICs than manuka honey against 16 of tested isolates. This study showed that Slovak honeydew honey has exceptional antibacterial activity against multi-drug resistant S. maltophilia isolates and was more efficient than manuka honey (UMF 15 +).

For antimicrobial activity determination honey solutions were prepared at three concentrations: 50, 25 and 12. 5 % (by mass per volume). The potential antimicrobial activity of  selected samples against four species of bacteria (Escherichia coli CCM 3988, Pseudomonas aeroginosa CCM 1960, Staphylococcus epidermis CCM 4418, Bacillus cereus CCM 2010) and two species of yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCM 8191, Candida albicans CCM 8216) was studied using the disc diffusion method.
