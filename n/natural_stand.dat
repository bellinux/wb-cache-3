40|$|Biomass {{dynamics}} {{were studied}} in isolated relict stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) {{on the dry}} steppe of Kazakhstan (53 - 54 ° N), where potential evaporation is 500 - 600 mm yr- 1 and the rainfall is 250 - 260 mm yr- 1. Samples were taken from seven plots in <b>natural</b> <b>stands</b> on sandy forest soils (aged 13 - 110 yrs) and ten plots in plantations on dark-chestnut-coloured soils (aged 5 - 50 yrs). Nine or ten sample trees were taken from each plot, giving a total of 68 and 96 sample trees in <b>natural</b> and plantation <b>stands</b> respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Carbohydrate {{concentration}} {{changes in}} below-ground biomass of subalpine tall grasslands with Calamagrostis villosa (Chaix) J. F. Gmelin were monitored during one {{year on the}} slope of Petrovy kameny Mt. (Hrubý Jeseník Mts., Czech Republic). Stands of the community with natural snow conditions were compared with stands on a ski piste. Soil temperature de-velopment and snow melting times were also ob-served in the territory concerned. The difference was stated between mean annual temperature on control stands (4. 21 oC) and ski piste (3. 95 oC) in the upper 5 cm of soil. At the average, snow melted on the ski piste two weeks later than that on the <b>natural</b> <b>stands.</b> The <b>natural</b> <b>stands</b> and the stands on the ski piste differ significantly {{from each other in}} terms of development of carbo-hydrate accumulation in the below-ground bio-mass. Consumption of reserve carbohydrates by the plants at both the ski piste and in the natu-ral stands was nearly similar during the winter. At the beginning of the growing season (July), significant difference in carbohydrate concentra-tion in below-ground organs between stands on the ski piste and <b>natural</b> <b>stands</b> was observed. It was caused by late melting of the snow cover and subsequent delay of the phenologic development and assimilation of the vegetation in the ski piste. Later in season (August, October), the differences in carbohydrate concentration between stands at the ski piste and <b>natural</b> <b>stands</b> disappeared. The mean annual amount of carbohydrates in the up-per (0 – 5 cm) and lower (5 – 10 cm) soil horizons in <b>natural</b> <b>stands</b> and ski piste stands do not differ fundamentally, except for the significant differ-ence in July.

5000|$|The BFS {{contains}} native plant communities {{mixed with}} an array of drought-tolerant Old World species that have become naturalized in southern California. The average annual rainfall in Claremont is about 15 inches and the BFS is located on an alluvial fan which means the soil is fast-draining. Because of these factors, organisms are adapted to low water availability and the landscape is brown and dry much of the year. [...] Approximately two-thirds of the Station is coastal sage scrub. This ecosystem was never common and has largely disappeared due to development. Estimates are that less than 15% of it remains. It is part of the Mediterranean Biome. Coastal sage scrub consists mostly of small to medium shrubs which are adapted to winter rains and long, dry summers, and annuals which complete their life cycle in the spring. There are grasslands in the south and the east. The northeastern portion was at one time a citrus grove and is now a grassland. Oaks were planted along the road to the now-disused Infirmary, which was built in the 1930s to house ill students from Pomona College.

50|$|Projection of stand {{growth and}} {{ecosystem}} dynamics {{is based upon}} {{a representation of the}} rates of key ecological processes regulating the availability of, and competition for, light and nutrient resources (a representation of moisture effects on soil processes, plant physiology and growth, and the consequences of moisture competition is being added). The rates of these processes are calculated from a combination of historical bioassay data (such as biomass accumulation in plant components and changes in stand density over time) and measures of certain ecosystem variables (including decomposition rates, photosynthetic saturation curves, and plant tissue nutrient concentrations) by relating ‘biologically active’ biomass components (foliage and small roots) to calculated values of nutrient uptake, the capture of light energy, and net primary production.Using this ‘internal calibration’ or hybrid approach, the model generates a suite of growth properties for each tree and understory plant species that is to be represented in a subsequent simulation. These growth properties are used to model growth as a function of resource availability and competition. They include (but are not limited to): (1) photosynthetic efficiency per unit foliage biomass and its nitrogen content based on relationships between foliage nitrogen, simulated self-shading, and net primary productivity after accounting for litterfall and mortality; (2) nutrient uptake requirements based on rates of biomass accumulation and literature- or field-based measures of nutrient concentrations in different biomass components on sites of different nutritional quality (i.e. fertility); (3) light-related measures of tree and branch mortality derived from stand density and live canopy height input data in combination with simulated vertical light profiles. Light levels at which mortality of branches and individual trees occur are estimated for each species. Many of FORECAST’s calculations are made at the stand level, but the model includes a sub-model which disaggregates stand-level productivity into the growth of individual stems with user-supplied information on stem size distributions at different stand ages. Top height and DBH are calculated for each stem and used in a taper function to calculate total and individual gross and merchantable volumes. Snags and logs are created in the model from <b>natural</b> <b>stand</b> self-thinning (mainly due to light competition) and from different types of user-defined disturbance events such as insect/disease-induced mortality, windthrow, non-commercial thinning and stand harvesting. Snag fall rates and log-decomposition are simulated using species-specific and tree-size-specific decay parameters derived from the literature, expert opinion, or field measurements.|$|E

40|$|The {{generality}} {{of relationships}} between soil net nitrogen (N) mineralization, aboveground N cycling, and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) for temperate forest ecosystems is unclear. It is also not known whether these variables and their relationships differ between evergreen and deciduous forests, or across soil types. To address these questions we compiled data on annual rates of in situ net N mineralization and ANPP for 16 conifer and 34 hardwood forests, including plantations and <b>natural</b> <b>stands</b> {{on a range of}} soils at six locations in Wisconsin and Minnesota, USA. For 31 <b>natural</b> <b>stands,</b> 48 stands with native species (including plantations), and all data, ANPP increased linearly with annual net N mineralization rates. Native evergreen conifer and two deciduous hardwood types (oaks and mesic hardwoods) followed similar patterns in this regression, indicating common functional relationships at the ecosystem level. The relationship of N mineralization and ANPP differed between finer textured Alfisol soils and sandier Entisols, with higher ANPP at any given N mineralization level in Alfisols. A multiple regression of N mineralization on soil texture (percentage silt plus clay), litterfall N, and mean annual temperature explained 81 % of the variance in annual N mineralization for <b>natural</b> <b>stands,</b> and a multiple regression of ANPP on soil texture and annual N mineralization rate explained 83 % of the variance in ANPP. Naturally regenerated forest types differed in mean annual net N mineralization, litterfall N, and ANPP, and all were greater in oaks than in mesic hardwoods or conifers, respectively. However, differences among the 50 stands and six locations were largely a result of differences in soils and stand origin. For all <b>natural</b> hardwood <b>stands,</b> ANPP and N mineralization were greater on fine-textured Alfisols than on sandy Entisols. For evergreen conifers, ANPP and N mineralization were greater in plantations on Alfisols than in <b>natural</b> <b>stands</b> on Histosols, Entisols, or Spodosols. Hardwood and evergreen conifer stands did not differ significantly in ANPP or N mineralization on comparable soils and stand origin: they differed neither as plantations on Alfisols nor as <b>natural</b> <b>stands</b> on Entisols. This suggests that observed average differences among natural forest types in ANPP and N mineralization resulted largely from variation in their distribution on differing soils, and not from feedback effects on N mineralization or differing productivity per available N. These data suggest that, at a regional scale, {{at least half of the}} variation in ANPP can be attributed to variation in annual N mineralization. Both ANPP and N mineralization differ more strongly with soil type/parent material than with forest type; ANPP at any given level of N mineralization is higher on silty/loamy Alfisols than on sandy Entisols, Histosols, or Spodosols, but not different for coniferous and broad-leaved deciduous species. There is no indication of N saturation of ANPP within the range of natural N availability in these forests...|$|R
