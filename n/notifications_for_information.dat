The service {{is based on the}} dichotomy of interest and privacy Notifications of user activities are a function of relevance in the current work situation and the privacy requirements of the involved users The paper motivates the AREA framework and discusses the system in terms of its formal modeling capabilities and its operational aspects This is followed by practical implementation considerations addressing the role of AREA as a groupware infrastructure Finally, a prototype groupware application is presented, which uses the AREA service to support user awarenes...|$|R
40|$|Facebook is {{a popular}} {{platform}} that may facilitate learning activities at university. In this study, students' perceptions of using 'Facebook pages' within individual university subject offerings were evaluated. Individual 'Facebook pages' were developed for four university courses and used to provide information relevant to the courses and allow opportunities for student interaction. An initial questionnaire administered in the first lecture of semester indicated that nearly all students (n= 161, 93. 1 %) possessed an active Facebook account. Most students (n= 135, 78. 0 %) anticipated that a Facebook page would facilitate their learning, by increased interaction with students and instructors, and <b>notifications</b> <b>for</b> course <b>information.</b> A second questionnaire was completed in the final lecture of semester indicating that 81. 9 % of students engaged with the course Facebook page at some stage. However, perceptions {{of the effectiveness of}} the page as a learning tool were variable, with only 51 % of students stating that it was effective. Despite this, the majority of students (n= 110, 76. 4 %) recommended using Facebook in future courses. This preliminary evaluation of Facebook as a learning aid suggests that {{it has the potential to}} promote collaborative and cooperative learning, but further research is required, specifically to understand if and how it can enhance learning outcomes.

40|$|This papers {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} providing effective, computer-based support for awareness and interaction in the distributed workaday world. We report {{the story of how}} our content-based, pure notifcation server, called Elvin, became widely adopted in our organisation and elsewhere, augmenting the virtual work environment, and providing perceptual resources for awareness. Examples of its uses include: support for interaction via bi-directional chat-like facilities as well as support <b>for</b> uni-directional <b>notifications,</b> <b>for</b> example push-based <b>information</b> from services such as WWW and email, and notifications of the activites of others through rooms bookings, version control changes, and so on. These uses have {{had a significant impact on}} the way people interact with information sources and on social cohesion within the organisation. The attraction of Elvin lies in its conceptual simplicity, absence of built-in policy, expressive power and multilingual range of simple APIs. Its uptake is largely a result of the Tickertape Elvin cleint, which provides asimple, compelling interface usable in numerous different situations. We contend that even though it does not try to be a collaboration-friendly notification service, Elvin is paradoxically very useful for collaborative awareness and interaction support...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe United States has offered free worldwide position, navigation, and timing (PNT) broadcast data through the Global Positioning System (GPS) since its 1993 initial operations capable declaration, and periodic modernization {{efforts have been}} made throughout its 20 -year history. A planned modernized L 5 safety of life GPS signal, combined with the current GPS-enabled device ubiquity, offers an unprecedented opportunity to embed and broadcast other non-PNT information into GPS signals and reach individuals {{on a global scale}} with information in new ways. Adequate additional bandwidth exists in the new L 5 safety of life signal to embed <b>notification</b> <b>information</b> <b>for</b> worldwide natural and technological disasters and add a new communication medium for a possible global disaster notification system. This thesis explores the background, requirements, system design and U. S. policy of a disaster-notification enabled GPS L 5 safety of life signal. Captain, United States Air Forc...|$|R
