40|$|The strain-based failure {{assessment}} diagram (SB-FAD) {{has been developed}} for predicting failure from flaws in components subjected to high plastic strains.

For the CWP specimens tested in this work, the SB-FAD in its unmodified form resulted in over-conservative predictions of failure. This is attributed to the SB-FAD assuming high constraint conditions and the presence of a sharp fatigue crack, whereas the CWP specimens tested in this work were low constraint and contained a shallow <b>machined</b> <b>notch</b> without fatigue cracks. A modification of the SB-FAD is then proposed to account for nonsharp defects loaded to high plastic strains under conditions of low constraint. The resulting predictions of the modified SB-FAD show significantly reduced conservatism compared to the unmodified SB-FAD...|$|R

50|$|The {{advancement}} of a rotor {{other than the}} left-hand one was called a turnover by the British. This was achieved by a ratchet and pawl mechanism. Each rotor had a ratchet with 26 teeth and every time a key was pressed, the set of spring-loaded pawls moved forward in unison, trying to engage with a ratchet. The alphabet ring of the rotor to the right normally prevented this. As this ring rotated with its rotor, a <b>notch</b> <b>machined</b> into it would eventually align itself with the pawl, allowing it to engage with the ratchet, and advance the rotor on its left. The right-hand pawl, having no rotor and ring to its right, stepped its rotor with every key depression. For a single-notch rotor in the right-hand position, the middle rotor stepped once for every 26 steps of the right-hand rotor. Similarly for rotors two and three. For a two-notch rotor, the rotor to its left would turn over twice for each rotation.|$|R

As part of this on-going effort several experiments utilizing a novel optical Moir based concept along with external blade tip clearance and shaft displacement instrumentation were conducted on a simulated turbine engine disk {{as a means of}} demonstrating a potential optical crack detection technique. A Moir pattern results from the overlap of two repetitive patterns with slightly different periods. With this technique, it is possible to detect very small differences in spacing and hence radial growth in a rotating disk due to a flaw such as a crack. The experiment involved etching a circular reference pattern on a subscale engine disk that had a 50. 8 mm (2 in.) long <b>notch</b> <b>machined</b> into it to simulate a crack. The disk was operated at speeds up to 12 000 rpm and the Moir pattern due to the shift with respect to the reference pattern was monitored as a means of detecting the radial growth of the disk due to the defect.

40|$|The {{laminate}} cohesive approach (LCA) is {{a methodology}} {{for the experimental}} characterization of cohesive through-the-thickness damage propagation in fiber-reinforced polymer matrix composites. LCA has several advantages over other existing approaches for cohesive law characterization, including: visual measurements of crack length are not required, structural effects are accounted for, and LCA can be applied when the specimen {{is too small to}} achieve steady-state fracture. In this work, the applicability of this method is investigated for two material systems: IM 7 / 8552, a conventional prepreg, and AS 4 /VRM 34, a non-crimp fabric cured using an out-of-autoclave process.

40|$|Polycrystalline graphites {{are widely}} used in the metallurgical, nuclear and {{aerospace}} industries. Graphites are particulated composites manufactured {{with a mixture of}} coke with pitch, and changes in relative proportions of these materials cause modifications in their mechanical properties. Uniaxial tension tests must be avoided for mechanical characterization in this kind of brittle material, due to difficulties in making the relatively long specimens and premature damages caused during testing set-up. On other types of tests, e. g. bending tests, the specimens are submitted to combined stress states (normal and transverse shear stresses). The Iosipescu shear test, is performed in a beam with two 90 ° opposite <b>notches</b> <b>machined</b> at the mid-length of the specimens, by applying two forces couples, so that a pure and uniform shear stress state is generated at the cross section between the two notches. When a material is isotropic and brittle, a failure at 45 ° in relation to the beam long axis can take place, i. e., the tensile normal stress acts parallel to the lateral surface of the notches, controls the failure and the result of the shear test is numerically equivalent to the tensile strength. This work has evaluated a graphite of the type used in rocket nozzles by the Iosipescu test and the resulted stress, ~ 11 MPa, was found to be equal to the tensile strength. Thus, the tensile strength can be evaluated just by a single and simple experiment, thus avoiding complicated machining of specimen and testing set-up...|$|R

In the present paper, {{it was shown}} that the addition of MWCNTs results in a refinement of the composites microstructure. Moreover, nanoindentation tests were performed in order to monitor the change in elastic modulus and hardness with MWCNT content and {{it was found that}} both properties decrease with the addition of MWCNT content. A novel method was used to measure the true fracture toughness of the composites by producing a shallow surface sharp <b>notch</b> <b>machined</b> by ultra-short pulsed laser ablation on the surface of beam specimens. The true fracture toughness obtained on this laser machined single edge V-notch beam (SEVNB) specimens tested in four point bending was compared to the indentation fracture toughness measured using a Vickers indenter. It was found that the indentation fracture toughness increases with increasing MWCNT content, while the true fracture toughness determined with SEVNB was practically independent of the composition. Finally, it was concluded that the increase in the resistance to indentation cracking of the composites with respect to 3 Y-TZP matrix cannot be associated to higher true fracture toughness. The results were discussed in terms of transformation toughening, damage induced in front of the notch tip, microstructure of the composites, and fracture toughness of 3 Y-TZP.

The size and location distributions of service generated FOD were documented; no FOD exceeded a depth of 0. 5 mm (0. 020 in.). LPB processing of the fan blade leading edge was therefore designed to provide tolerance of 0. 5 mm deep FOD. A zone of – 100 ksi through-thickness compression was achieved extending back 6. 3 mm chord-wise from the leading edge along {{the lower half of}} the blade from the platform to the mid-span damper. Residual stress distributions were measured as functions of depth and position along the leading edge using x-ray diffraction mapping. HCF testing was with the leading edge cantilever loaded under a sustained mean stress (R= 0. 1). FOD was simulated with 60 -degree “V ” <b>notches</b> <b>machined</b> into the leading edge at the point of maximum applied stress. The 620 MPa (90 ksi) endurance limit of as-received blades was reduced to less than half by 0. 5 mm. FOD. LPB produced an HCF strength of 861 MPa (125 ksi) without FOD, and strengths equal or greater than the as-received blades for FOD up to 1. 3 mm (0. 050 in.) deep- an order of magnitude improvement in damage tolerance. Fatigue life modeling confirmed the HCF strength achieved, and suggests FOD tolerance can be further increased by optimizing the size and shape of the compressive zone...|$|R
