40|$|After {{a review}} of the many effects of {{metallicity}} on the evolution of rotating and <b>non-rotating</b> <b>stars,</b> we discuss the consequences of a high metallicity on massive star populations and on stellar nucleosynthesis. The most striking effect of high metallicity is to enhance the amount of mass lost by stellar winds. Typically at a metallicity $Z= 0. 001 $ only 9 % of the total mass returned by <b>non-rotating</b> massive <b>stars</b> is ejected by winds (91 % by supernovae explosion), while at solar metallicity this fraction may amount to more than 40 %. High metallicity favors the formation of Wolf-Rayet stars and of type Ib supernovae. It however disfavors the occurrence of type Ic supernovae. We estimate empirical yields of carbon based on the observed population of WC stars in the solar neighborhood, and obtain that WC stars eject between 0. 2 and 0. 4 % of the mass initially locked into stars under the form of new synthesized carbon. Models give values well in agreement with these empirical yields. Chemical evolution models indicate that such carbon yields may have important impacts on the abundance of carbon at high metallicity.

In addition, these stars have opaque circumstellar material, obscuring the central star, so that no detailed surface abundance studies can be performed. We propose a different indicator for the supergiant status of a B[e] star, based on the enrichment of its circumstellar matter by 13 C, and detectable via its 13 CO band emission in the K band spectra. Based on stellar evolution models, we calculate the variation of the 12 C/ 13 C isotopic surface abundance ratio during the evolution of <b>non-rotating</b> <b>stars</b> with different initial masses. For different values of the 12 C/ 13 C ratio we then compute synthetic first-overtone vibration-rotational band spectra from both the 12 CO and 13 CO molecule at different spectral resolutions. We further discuss the influence of stellar rotation on the variation of the surface 12 C/ 13 C ratio. The surface 12 C/ 13 C isotope ratio is found to decrease strongly during the post-main sequence evolution of <b>non-rotating</b> <b>stars,</b> from its interstellar value of about 70 to a value of about 15 - 20 for stars with initial masses higher than 7 M_sun, and to a value of less than 5 for stars with initial masses higher than 25 M_sun.

The detection of 13 CO band head emission in such mid-resolution K band spectra of a B[e] star thus favours an evolved rather than a young nature of the object.

We use the evolutionary models which describe how a <b>non-rotating</b> <b>star</b> cools down and contracts while neutrino diffusion and thermalization processes dominate the stellar dynamics. For assigned values of the evolution time, we set the star into slow rotation and integrate the equations of stellar perturbations in the Cowling approximation, both in the time domain and in the frequency domain, to find the quasi-normal mode frequencies.

40|$|Several {{classes of}} stars (most notably O and B main-sequence stars, {{as well as}} accreting white dwarfs and neutron stars) rotate quite rapidly, at spin {{frequencies}} greater than the typical g-mode frequencies. We discuss how rapid rotation modifies the κ-mechanism excitation and observability of g-mode oscillations. We find that, by affecting the timescale match between the mode period and the thermal time at the driving zone, rapid rotation stabilizes some of the g-modes that are excited in a <b>non-rotating</b> <b>star,</b> and, conversely, excites g-modes that are damped in absence of rotation. The fluid velocities and temperature perturbations are strongly concentrated near the equator for most g-modes in rapidly rotating stars, which means that a favorable viewing angle {{may be required to}} observe the pulsations. Moreover, the stability of modes of the same l but different m is affected differently by rotation.

As the small expansion parameter epsilon, the ratio of the orbital period to the time scale of the star's evolution is used. The amplitude of the tide is of the order epsilon- 1 / 2 during the passage through resonance and remains of that order afterwards. At time of resonance, the tidal displacement displays a phase delay of 3 pi/ 4 or pi/ 4 with respect to the tide-generating potential according as the frequency of the free oscillation mode increases or decreases due to the star's evolution.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{instability}} for exciting incompressible modes (e. g. gravity or Rossby modes) {{at the surface}} of a star accreting through a boundary layer. The instability excites a stellar mode by sourcing an acoustic wave in the disk at the boundary layer, which carries a flux of energy and angular momentum with the opposite sign as the energy and angular momentum density of the stellar mode. We call this instability the acoustic CFS instability, because of the direct analogy to the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability for exciting modes on a rotating star by emission of energy in the form of gravitational waves. However, the acoustic CFS instability differs from its gravitational wave counterpart in that the fluid medium in which the acoustic wave propagates (i. e. the accretion disk) typically rotates faster than the star in which the incompressible mode is sourced. For this reason, the instability can operate even for a <b>non-rotating</b> <b>star</b> in the presence of an accretion disk.
