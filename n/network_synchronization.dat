The main contribution of this paper is summarized as follows: (1) A more general system was introduced to solve practical problems. (2) Sufficient conditions were obtained to ensure the complex dynamical <b>networks</b> <b>synchronization.</b> (3) The pinning controller is designed to ensure the complex dynamical <b>networks</b> <b>synchronization.</b> (4) The design of the control results can be seen from Figures  1 - 6.

50|$|The Neural <b>network</b> <b>synchronization</b> protocol, {{abbreviated}} as NNSP, {{is built}} on the application-level layer of the OSI upon TCP/IP. Aiming at secure communication, this protocol's design make use of a concept called neural <b>network</b> <b>synchronization.</b> Server and each connected client must create special type of neural network called Tree Parity Machine then compute outputs of their neural networks and exchange them in an iterative manner through the public channel. By learning and exchanging public outputs of their networks, client's and server's neural networks will be synchronized, meaning they will have identical synaptic weights, after some time. Once synchronization is achieved, weights of networks are used for secret key derivation. For the purposes of encryption/decryption of subsequent communication this symmetric key is used.|$|E

MCSG extracts the content-oriented <b>network</b> slice <b>synchronization</b> information which are need to be synchronized and distributes them as the requests of content-oriented <b>network</b> slice <b>synchronization</b> updating information to all the SBSs, UEs, and MBS.

For those who desire stronger Mac OS/CLIÉ integration, the product Missing Sync made by the company Mark/Space is also available. This does make unencrypted Wi-Fi synchronization possible but a bug in the CLIÉ network stack reverses IP addresses which means that the Macintosh involved needs a palindromic IP address such as 10.0.0.10.|$|E
5000|$|The {{holdover}} capability then {{is provided}} either by a free running local oscillator, or a local oscillator that is steered with software that retains knowledge {{of its past}} performance. The earliest documentation of such an effort comes from the then National Bureau of Standards in 1968 Fey, Machlan and Barnes, [...] "An Ultra Precise Time Synchronization System Designed By Computer Simulation", Frequency, where an analog computer consisting of ball-disk integrators implemented a third order control loop to correct for the frequency ageing of an oscillator. The first microprocessor implementation of this concept occurred in 1983 Penrod, [...] "An Analysis of a Microprocessor Controlled Disciplined Frequency Standard", Frequency Control Symposium where Loran-C broadcasts were used to discipline very high quality quartz oscillators as a Cesium replacement in telecommunications wireline <b>network</b> <b>synchronization.</b> The basic aim of a steering mechanism {{is to improve the}} stability of a clock or oscillator while minimizing the number of times it needs calibration. In Holdover the learned behaviour of the OCXO is used to anticipate and correct for future behavior. Effective aging and temperature compensation can be provided by such a mechanism and the system designer is faced with a range of choices for algorithms and techniques to do this correction including extrapolation, interpolation and predictive filters (including Kalman filters).|$|E

30|$|In recent years, complex {{networks}} {{have received a}} lot of research attention since the pioneering work of Watts and Strogatz [1]. The main reason is two-fold: the first reason is that complex networks can be found in almost everywhere in real world, such as the Internet, WWW, the World Trade Web, genetic networks, and social networks; the second reason is that the dynamical behaviors of complex {{networks have}} found numerous applications in various fields such as physics, technology, and so on [2 – 4]. Complex networks are a set of inter-connected nodes, in which each node is a basic unit with specific contents or dynamics. Among all of dynamical behaviors of complex <b>networks,</b> <b>synchronization</b> {{is one of the most}} interesting topics and has been extensively investigated [5, 6]. Synchronization phenomena are very common and important in real world <b>networks,</b> such as <b>synchronization</b> phenomena on the Internet, synchronization transfer of digital or analog signals in communication <b>networks,</b> and <b>synchronization</b> related to biological neural <b>networks.</b> Hence, <b>synchronization</b> analysis in complex networks is important both in theory and application [7, 8].|$|R
5000|$|Ben-Jacob's {{studies in}} {{neuroscience}} are guided by {{an effort to}} simplify the complexity searching for principles of information coding, memory and learning. He has many unique contributions {{in the field of}} Systems Neuroscience and Neural Networks, including the relations between network size and its synchronized activity, the discovery of hidden neuron correlations, function-form relations and mutual synchronization in engineered networks, the effect of DNA damage on <b>network</b> <b>synchronization,</b> neuro-glia communication, new modeling of intra- and inter-cell calcium dynamics, using nano technology for network engineering, discovery and modeling of the dynamical motives (repertoire) of coupled neural networks, development of a novel system-level analysis of neural network activity (the functional holography analysis), mapping and assessments of epileptic foci, and more. Yet, the development of the first neuro-memory-chip with his doctoral student at the time, Itay Baruchi, is Ben-Jacob's most important contribution in systems neuroscience. While previous attempts were based on [...] "teaching by reward" [...] (enhancing excitatory synapses) or [...] "teaching by punishment" [...] (inhibition of excitatory synapses), Baruchi and Ben-Jacob's approach was [...] "teaching by liberation", or [...] "inhibition of inhibition" [...] (inhibition of inhibitory synapses). Being recognized as a groundbreaking discovery in systems neuroscience, the achievement was awarded in 2007 the SciAm 50, The Scientific American Award for the 50 most important achievements in all fields of science and technology.

Different cases of interest on <b>network</b> <b>synchronization</b> are studied, including for a large number of fireflies oscillators; we consider synchronization in small-world networks and outer synchronization among different coupled networks topologies; for all presented cases, we provide appropriate ranges of values for coupling strength and extensive numerical simulations are included.

40|$|<b>Network</b> time <b>synchronization</b> is a {{requirement}} for TD-LTE systems to prevent multi-access and cross-slot interference. Network listening is a technique used for <b>network</b> time <b>synchronization</b> in femto cellular networks. However, femto BSs which use network listening technique for synchronization suffer from interference coming from neighboring femto BSs. In this thesis the possibility to coordinate the reception times of the non-synchronized femto BSs is investigated so as to combat the interference issues in <b>network</b> listening based <b>synchronization</b> for TD-LTE femto BSs. This coordination effectively reduces the interference among the non-synchronized femto BSs and thereby enables the network to converge to a common frame timing. Further coordinated reception is combined with and compared to coordinated transmission methods. Also a proof of concept implementation of a simple <b>network</b> time <b>synchronization</b> scheme based on network listening is done on a test bed {{with the help of}} Software Defined Radios (SDRs) ...|$|R
40|$|We study optimal <b>synchronization</b> of <b>networks</b> of coupled phase oscillators. We extend {{previous}} {{theory for}} optimizing the synchronization properties of undirected networks to the important case of directed networks. We derive a generalized synchrony alignment function that encodes {{the interplay between}} network structure and the oscillators' natural frequencies and serves as an objective measure for the <b>network's</b> degree of <b>synchronization.</b> Using the generalized synchrony alignment function, we show that a <b>network's</b> <b>synchronization</b> properties can be systematically optimized. This framework also allows us to study the properties of synchrony-optimized networks, and in particular, investigate the role of directed network properties such as nodal in- and out-degrees. For instance, we find that in optimally rewired networks the heterogeneity of the in-degree distribution roughly matches the heterogeneity of the natural frequency distribution, but no such relationship emerges for out-degrees. We also observe that a <b>network's</b> <b>synchronization</b> properties are promoted by {{a strong correlation between}} the nodal in-degrees and the natural frequencies of oscillators, whereas the relationship between the nodal out-degrees and the natural frequencies has comparatively little effect. This result is supported by our theory, which indicates that synchronization is promoted by a strong alignment of the natural frequencies with the left singular vectors corresponding to the largest singular values of the Laplacian matrix...|$|R

It {{has been shown that}} with introducing the weak heterogeneity to regular <b>networks,</b> the <b>synchronization</b> may be slightly increased for diffusive couplings, while it is decreased for sigmoid couplings. This increase in the synchronization for diffusive couplings is shown to be due to their local, negative feedback contributions, but not due to the shorten average distance in SW <b>networks.</b> <b>Synchronization</b> of SW <b>networks</b> depends not only on their structure but also on the type of couplings.

We combined electrical recording using multi-electrode array with optical stimulation of cultured channelrhodopsin- 2 transducted hippocampal neurons to study and manipulate <b>network</b> burst <b>synchronization.</b> We found low frequency photo-stimulation protocols that are sufficient to induce potentiation of network bursting, modifying bursting dynamics and increasing interneuronal synchronization. Surprisingly, slowly fading-in light stimulation, which substantially delayed and reduced light driven spiking, was at least as effective in reorganizing network dynamics as much stronger pulsed light stimulation. Our study shows that mild stimulation protocols that do not enforce particular activity patterns onto the network can be highly effective inducers of network-level plasticity...|$|R

Figure  1 presents the evolution of the <b>network</b> <b>synchronization</b> about the window sequential number m, where (a), (b), (c) and (d) are the results in the four cases, namely, Δ t= 30 and δ = 10, Δ t= 30 and δ = 30, Δ t= 45 and δ = 10, Δ t= 45 and δ = 30 respectively. From Fig.  1, {{it can be seen that}} the level of the <b>network</b> <b>synchronization</b> fluctuates slightly around 0.36 under different choices of the window size and the time interval between adjacent windows. And the change of both variables does not cause significant change of the <b>network</b> <b>synchronization.</b> In fact, the mean and the standard deviation in Fig.  1 a–d are 0.3657 and 0.0478, 0.3658 and 0.0462, 0.3635 and 0.0446, 0.3634 and 0.0446 respectively.
