40|$|Chimpanzees {{infected}} with the primary isolate DH 012 mount potent <b>neutralizing</b> antibodies. This DH 012 <b>neutralizing</b> activity is highly strain specific. Immune sera from guinea pigs immunized with recombinant DH 012 gp 120 could also <b>neutralize</b> this primary isolate. The <b>neutralizing</b> activity in chimpanzee and guinea pig sera against wild-type DH 012 appears to be independent of a linear epitope in the V 3 region of gp 120. Interestingly, the neutralization escape mutant derived from growing DH 012 {{in the presence of}} the potent <b>neutralizing</b> chimpanzee serum is at least 50 -fold more sensitive than wild-type DH 012 to neutralization by guinea pig immune sera. The unusually potent <b>neutralizing</b> activity against the DH 012 neutralization-resistant virus is due to the presence of anti-V 3 antibodies in guinea pig sera. These results suggested that recombinant gp 120 could induce <b>neutralizing</b> antibodies against primary isolate DH 012. The V 3 of wild-type DH 012 is poorly immunogenic in infected chimpanzees and is not accessible to <b>neutralizing</b> V 3 antibodies.

To dissect the epitope specificity of the group-specific <b>neutralizing</b> antibodies, CD 4 attachment site-specific antibodies (CD 4 -site Abs) were isolated from total anti-gp 120 Abs by using a CD 4 -blocked gp 120 SF 2 -Sepharose column. The CD 4 -site Abs exhibited group-specific <b>neutralizing</b> activities. Another approach to dissecting type- and group-specific <b>neutralizing</b> activities of total anti-gp 120 Abs was to separate the third variable region (V 3) -specific antibodies (V 3 -region Abs) from non-V 3 -region-specific antibodies (non-V 3 Abs). The results indicated that V 3 -region Abs exhibited type-specific <b>neutralizing</b> activities, whereas non-V 3 Abs exhibited group-specific <b>neutralizing</b> activities. By comparing the <b>neutralizing</b> activities of V 3 -region Abs to those of non-V 3 Abs, we concluded that V 3 -region Abs are more effective than non-V 3 Abs in <b>neutralizing</b> a specific HIV isolate.

At the Battle of Auerstadt in 1806, King Frederick William III of Prussia outnumbered the French by 63,000 to 27,000; however, when he was told, mistakenly, that Napoleon was in command, he ordered a hasty retreat that turned into a rout.

40|$|The {{principal}} <b>neutralizing</b> {{determinant of}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) {{is located in the}} external envelope protein, gp 120, and has previously been mapped to a 24 -amino acid-long sequence (denoted RP 135).

In addition, using synthetic peptide fragments of RP 135, we have mapped the <b>neutralizing</b> determinant to 8 amino acids and found that a peptide of this size elicits <b>neutralizing</b> antibodies. This sequence contains a central Gly-Pro-Gly that is generally conserved between different HIV- 1 isolates and is flanked by amino acids that differ from isolate to isolate.

40|$|Background and aims: The {{behavioural}} addiction {{model of}} obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) proposes that as compulsions successfully reduce obsession-provoked anxiety {{in the early}} stages of the disorder, their performance is rewarding and therefore potentially addictive. According to this theory, the urge to perform a compulsion or neutralization resembles craving in addiction, and ventral fronto-striatal reward circuitry is activated during compulsive or <b>neutralizing</b> behaviour, resembling substance addiction disorders. The current study used EEG source localisation to test this hypothesis by examining brain activity accompanying the urge to <b>neutralize</b> and covert neutralization. Methods: Two groups of non-clinical participants (15 Low-OC, 15 High-OC) performed a task in which the urge to <b>neutralize</b> was induced by supplying participants with an obsessive-compulsive-like thought.

40|$|Background: Although {{there is}} a growing body of {{literature}} to support the importance of understanding self processes in the experience of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), no experimental research has directly examined the relationship between self-construals and phenomena central to OCD. The current study examined the effect that unwanted intrusions and <b>neutralizing</b> responses have on self-worth, distress and urge to <b>neutralize.</b> Methods: After listening to repeated audio recordings of idiosyncratic unwanted intrusions, a combined nonclinical and clinical OCD sample were asked to respond with either their chosen <b>neutralizing</b> strategy (experimental) or a refocus counting strategy (control). Each condition comprised of a 12 -min responding period (respond) followed by an equivalent non-response period (listen). Participants completed each condition, and were randomly allocated into the condition completed first. Ratings of discomfort, urge to <b>neutralize,</b> and self-worth were measured throughout. Results: <b>Neutralizing</b> and refocussing responses were both associated with decreases in discomfort and higher self-worth. The expected rebound effect for discomfort and urge to <b>neutralize</b> for the listen period after <b>neutralizing</b> was found. Limitations: Methodological problems lead to missing data, although this was corrected with the use of Multi Level Modelling (MLM) analysis on a combined sample. The small clinical sample meant that comparison between the two populations was not possible. Conclusions: Findings support cognitive accounts that <b>neutralizing</b> is involved in the development and maintenance of OCD, and suggest that <b>neutralizing</b> is a purposeful response aimed to help reinstate selfworth.
