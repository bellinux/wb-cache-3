40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} effect of regulatory <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> on consumer decision making. Essay 1 explores how regulatory <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> affects expert and novice consumers’ knowledge calibration—the consistency between their ability and confidence. Expert and novice consumers are different in their ability and confidence, but there is lack of unanimous findings {{of the difference in}} their knowledge calibration. To resolve this discrepancy, I propose that regulatory <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> reduces experts’ ability but increases novices’ confidence, each of which reduces knowledge calibration. I conduct a series of experiments to test my hypotheses. The results show that 1) regulatory <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> has stronger negative impact on experts’ ability and stronger positive influence on novices’ confidence; 2) when both ability and confidence are affected by regulatory <b>resource</b> <b>depletion,</b> individuals, regardless of their expertise, are less calibrated; 3) novices are better calibrated when regulatory <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> impacts on ability only while experts are better calibrated when regulatory <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> influences confidence only; 4) {{the effect of}} regulatory <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> of ability on reducing experts’ knowledge calibration is stronger for tasks involving fluid rather than crystallized intelligence; and 5) the effect of regulatory <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> of confidence on reducing novices’ knowledge calibration is stronger when the task is perceived easy versus difficult. Essay 2 examines how regulatory <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> affects the types of transactions in which consumers engage. Unlike traditional wisdom that suggests depleted individuals prefer hedonic over utilitarian products, and become risk seeking due to self-control failure, I propose that regulatory <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> leads to a concrete and practical mindset in consumer transactions. This change in mindset leads consumers to focus on utility and risk minimization. I conduct a series of studies to test my conceptual framework. The results show that under the impact of regulatory <b>resource</b> <b>depletion,</b> consumers are more likely to 1) shop for utilitarian over hedonic products; 2) choose fixed price option over auction; and 3) increase their willingness-to-pay (WTP) and decrease their willingness-to-accept (WTA). The results also show that the influence of regulatory <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> on concrete concerns is mitigated if decision makers focus on a higher mental construal...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a procedure}} for embodying {{the principle of}} resource sustainability in evaluating projects that use significant amounts of natural resources. In this analysis, sustainability requires maintaining the productivity of the resource used over time, either by renewing the resource or by investing its depletion in other capital assets. The basis of a project's evaluation is its net present social value (NPSV), including <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> as a social cost. The social cost of depletion is the amount that must be saved and reinvested annually to accumulate a fund that will yield a perpetual annual income equal to the net output lost by <b>resource</b> <b>depletion.</b> By treating <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> as a social cost in calculating NPSV, projects causing {{a high rate of}} <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> receive a relatively low valuation compared with projects causing less <b>resource</b> <b>depletion.</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>depletion</b> includes environmental damage caused by constructing and operating a project, as well as the direct consumption of natural resources.

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of environmental protection}} in modern communities is vital, the action and implementation of any program requires the sufficient {{knowledge and understanding of}} environment. One of the methods to preserve natural resources and achieving sustainable development, especially sustainable agriculture, is the environmentally evaluation of agriculture production processes. Life cycle assessment approach is an accepted method for determining the side effects of a production process on environment during its complete life cycle. In this research, the impacts of global warming, acidification, fossil <b>resources</b> <b>depletion</b> and water <b>resources</b> <b>depletion</b> of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) production on environment is investigated using life cycle assessment method in Khezri Farming Company, one of the major production areas in South Khorasan province. The final environmental indices for global warming, acidification, fossil <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> and water <b>resources</b> <b>depletion</b> were 0. 0003, 0. 002, 0. 025 and 0. 073, respectively. In other words, the effect of water <b>resources</b> <b>depletion</b> has the greatest damaging potential on environment among others in sugar beet production in this region...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationships between foreign direct investment (FDI) and natural <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> and natural <b>resource</b> rents for a longitudinal (2005 – 2013 : N[*]=[*] 125 nations) sample of less developed countries (LDCs). Theoretically, we argue that FDI contributes to increased ecological withdrawals and dependence on the natural resource sector for economic growth within countries. We hypothesized that LDCs {{with higher levels of}} FDI would also have higher levels of natural <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> and income (i. e., rents). We assess whether this hypothesized relationship holds across nations in our sample for four different natural <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> and rents measures (energy, forest, mineral, and total natural resources). We find strong support for our hypotheses regarding natural <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> and <b>resource</b> rents, with the exception of energy rents. The outcome lends support to the ecological withdrawal and ecostructural theory of foreign investment dependence perspectives...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Research on the {{strength}} model of self-regulation is burgeoning, but little empirical work {{has focused on the}} link between distinct types of daily goal pursuit and the <b>depletion</b> of self-regulatory <b>resources.</b> Here we conducted two studies on the link between avoidance goals and <b>resource</b> <b>depletion.</b> Method: Study 1 (283 [228 female] Caucasians, ages 18 - 51) investigated the concurrent and longitudinal relations between avoidance goals and <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> over a one month period. Study 2 (132 [93 female] Caucasians, ages 18 - 49) investigated the concurrent and longitudinal relations between avoidance goals and <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> over a one month period and explored <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> as a mediator of the avoidance goal to subjective well-being relation. Results: Studies 1 and 2 documented both a concurrent and a longitudinal negative relationship between avoidance goals and self-regulatory resources, and Study 2 additionally showed that self-regulatory resources mediate the negative link between avoidance goals and subjective well-being. Ancillary analyses demonstrated that the results observed in the two studies were independent of neuroticism. Conclusions: These findings advance knowledge in both the <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> and avoidance goal literatures, and bolster the view that avoidance goal pursuit over time represents a self-regulatory vulnerability...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{examine the}} role of regulatory <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> in the effectiveness of social influence techniques aimed at inducing consumer compliance. They test the two-step hypothesis that a) responding to the initial request stage of an influence technique requires self-control, thereby depleting one's limited resource of self-regulatory energy, and b) a state of regulatory <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> fosters the use of heuristics present in the persuasion context, which increases the odds of compliance with the target request of an influence technique. A first field experiment shows that yielding to initial requests (answering a series of questions) induces <b>resource</b> <b>depletion.</b> Experiment 2 demonstrates that {{a lower level of}} self-regulatory resources increases the extent of compliance with a request through the employment of the heuristic principle of authority. Together these results provide support for the prediction that regulatory <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> is important in explaining the effectiveness of social influence techniques. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Resource</b> <b>depletion</b> aspects are {{repeatedly}} used as {{an argument}} for a shift towards new battery technologies. However, whether serious shortages due to the increased demand for traction and stationary batteries can actually be expected is subject to an ongoing discussion. In order to identify the principal drivers of <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> for battery production, we assess different lithium-ion battery types and a new lithium-free battery technology (sodium-ion) under this aspect, applying different assessment methodologies. The findings show that very different results are obtained with existing impact assessment methodologies, which hinders clear interpretation. While cobalt, nickel and copper can generally be considered as critical metals, the magnitude of their depletion impacts in comparison with that of other battery materials like lithium, aluminum or manganese differs substantially. A high importance is also found for indirect <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> effects caused by the co-extraction of metals from mixed ores. Remarkably, the <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> potential per kg of produced battery is driven only partially by the electrode materials and thus depends comparably little on the battery chemistry itself. One of the key drivers for <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> {{seems to be the}} metals (and co-products) in electronic parts required for the battery management system, a component rather independent from the actual battery chemistry. However, when assessing the batteries on a capacity basis (per kWh storage capacity), a high-energy density also turns out to be relevant, since it reduces the mass of battery required for providing one kWh, and thus the associated <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> impacts...|$|R

Published empirical studies of self-control in humans have provided {{evidence suggesting that}} the ability to exert self-control relies on a limited resource. Recent failed replications of the <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> effect, in addition to conflicting meta-analytic evidence, have called the robustness of the <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> effect into question. This dissertation aims to obtain a more accurate estimate of the depletion effect size using both an empirical replication and a novel meta-analytic method, p-curve. Monte Carlo simulations testing the accuracy of p-curve effect size estimates in the presence of publication bias and questionable research practices are also reported. Simulation results show that p-curve effect size estimates are unaffected by publication bias but fluctuate wildly when questionable research practices are simulated. Results from the empirical replication and meta-analysis suggest that the <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> effect is not as robust as previously thought.

40|$|Building on {{conservation}} of resources theory, we cast <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> as a novel explanatory mechanism to explain why employees’ experience of psychological contract violation results in harm to third parties outside the employee-organization exchange dyad. This resource-based perspective extends and complements the dominant social exchange perspective which views employee reactions to psychological contract violation as targeting {{the source of the}} violation – the organization. The present paper reports on three studies. Study 1 conducted an experiment with 109 participants and established the main effect of psychological contract violation on <b>resource</b> <b>depletion.</b> Study 2, using survey data from 315 medical employees and their immediate supervisors, found that after controlling for the social exchange mechanism (i. e., revenge cognitions toward the organization), <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> mediated the indirect effects of psychological contract violation on supervisory reports of employees’ interpersonal harming toward coworkers and decision-making vigilance for clients. Further, we found that organizational and professional identification played opposing moderating roles in the effects of violation on <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> and consequently behavioral outcomes, such that these mediated relationships were stronger when organizational identification was high, and weaker when professional identification was high. Study 3 replicated all the results obtained in Studies 1 and 2 with time-lagged data from 229 medical employees across three measurement points. The findings confirm that <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> is a more effective explanation of the consequences of violation on third parties than revenge cognitions, although both are useful in predicting organization-directed outcomes (i. e., civic virtue and organizational rule compliance) ...|$|R

30|$|Estimating future <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> and {{its impact}} on the economy in {{different}} world regions is a complicated endeavor with uncertain results. Rather than trying to be complete in our assessment, we presented several elements that could eventually become part of a very comprehensive analysis of future material criticality. The elements we included are the global multiregional long-term scope, the consideration of both factor endowments (mineral resources) and mining risk, the decision of actors to expand or maintain production capacity, the coupling between main and accompanying metals, and the consequences of possible drop-outs of major suppliers on global supply chains. We showed that already with a stylized approach as used here, one can quantify the impact of economic growth and supply chain disruptions on <b>resource</b> <b>depletion.</b> Moreover, we extended existing methodology by combining MRIO with dynamic stock models of metal resources and by incorporating mining risk into a <b>resources</b> <b>depletion</b> model. These extensions may be relevant for applications in a different context.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> accompanied aggregation on the Pajarito Plateau. It does so by examining changes in faunal resource availability and resource use during the Coalition and early Classic periods. The prehistoric deer population was estimated using precipitation data, following Young (1979). This estimation {{was used as a}} measure of potential resource availability for the periods concerned. Based upon the model, the mule deer population was expected to increase from the Coalition period to the early Classic period. Resource use was measured using faunal assemblages from 10 sites from the Pajarito Plateau. The sites examined in this thesis support various expectations which would suggest that <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> occurred on the Pajarito Plateau. It was found that changes in resource use could not be explained by environmental change alone. Thus, it appears that <b>resource</b> <b>depletion</b> on the Pajarito Plateau may have been due to human impact on the environment...|$|R
