50|$|The dermanyssid mites {{are visible}} to the naked eye and have long {{powerful}} legs that they use to seek their hosts. These mites live in the nest of their hosts or within the fabric of poultry houses. They infest their hosts whilst feeding for short periods. Their mouthparts are long complex organs adapted for piercing their host's skin and sucking blood. Dermanyssus gallinae, the red chicken mite is typical. Dense infestations of a poultry house cause much biting stress and loss of production to the birds, and human workers in the houses are bitten. Originally a parasite centered on the nest of its host, this species has become a major pest in commercial poultry houses. A similar genus is Ornithonyssus; O.bursa, the tropical fowl mite, and O.sylvarium the <b>northern</b> <b>fowl</b> <b>mite</b> cause similar problems in poultry production.|$|E
50|$|Dermanyssid mites {{are much}} larger than most {{parasitic}} mites and are easily {{visible to the naked}} eye. They have long, powerful legs that they use to seek their hosts and their size and active crawling cause them to resemble larval ticks. Their lifecycle proceeds from egg to larva to nymph to adult, and all of the active stages are only temporarily parasitic. A single blood meal is completed within a few minutes, so they are found on their hosts only for a short time relative to their time off the host. These types of mites naturally live in the nests of their bird hosts. The species of economic importance to poultry-rearing have adapted to living within the fabric of poultry houses. Their mouthparts are adapted for sucking blood with a pair of long piercing chelicerae. Dermanyssus gallinae, the poultry red mite, is typical. A related genus is Ornithonyssus - O. bursa, the tropical fowl mite, and O. sylvarium, the <b>northern</b> <b>fowl</b> <b>mite.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Northern</b> <b>fowl</b> <b>mite</b> {{infestation}} of caged layers, and to {{a lesser}} degree breeding birds, remains a frequent occurrence in poultry production. Successful control of these infestations requires accurate monitoring of mite presence, adequate methods of mite exclusion and removal, and effective as well as timely acaricide application. In the present study, parasiticides currently available for treatment of birds with <b>northern</b> <b>fowl</b> <b>mite</b> infestations were evaluated for effectiveness by index scoring and feather digests; data needed on a regional and periodic basis given the tendency for mite populations to develop and retain resistance.

40|$|Parasite {{populations are}} not evenly {{distributed}} among the hosts they infect. Nest ectoparasites, such as mites, {{are no exception}} as their distribution is highly aggregated with considerable variability between and within sites. Here, I examine the influence of microclimate, nest characteristics, and host condition on ectoparasite population size in a bird-ectoparasite system. I experimentally infested Barn Swallow (Hirundo rusitca erythrogaster) nests with <b>Northern</b> <b>Fowl</b> <b>Mites</b> (Ornithonyssus sylvarium) and analyzed both biotic (nestling mass, wing length, and brood size) and abiotic (temperature, humidity, nest lining, nest dimensions, and substrate upon which the nest was built) predictors of mite population size. Temperature and humidity measurements were collected every ten minutes for 14 days using iButtons (Maxim Integrated), which are small data loggers that collect and store temperature and humidity measurements until retrieved from the field. My results suggest that mite populations are largest in nests that have hosts in good condition, with higher temperatures, lower humidity, and low prevalence of other arthropods. I also found that nests built on wood substrates support larger populations of mites than those constructed on metal or concrete.

The effect of CME injections on <b>northern</b> <b>fowl</b> <b>mite</b> population development was also determined. White Rock and Fayoumi hens developed similar antibody concentrations {{in response to}} intramuscular injections of BSA according to serum samples analyzed with two-dimensional Immunoelectrophoresis. Rocket electrophoresis analyses of pooled serum samples showed significant differences between slopes of White Rock and Fayoumi pools for CME and BSA injections, suggesting differences in antibody-antigen interactions. Fayoumi hens injected with CME, 78, 50, and 14 days prior to experimental infestation with 2, 000 northern fowl mites/bird supported significantly fewer mites than BSA-injected hens, although mite popu-lations were low on both treatment groups. Injections of CME {{had no effect on}} mite population development on White Rock hens, even though CME-specific antibodies were detected.

40|$|<b>Northern</b> <b>fowl</b> <b>mites</b> were {{introduced}} {{in the center of}} each of four rows of cages in a poultry house containing uninfested White Leghorn hens. Individually housed hens (seven per row) were separated by empty cages. The vent regions of all hens were examined every 2 to 4 days for 11 weeks. Light infestations were noted in all four rows within the first 14 days, but mites apparently disappeared from two of the four rows (Rows 1 and 2) in the first 4 weeks. Infestations in the remaining two rows (Rows 3 and 4) increased first on the nearest hens and were detected on more distant hens only after mites had increased to moderate-to-high populations on closer hens. Within 8 to 9 weeks, infestations were heavy for all hens in Rows 3 and 4. By 8 weeks, mites again were evident in Rows 1 and 2; all hens in the house were infested by Week 11. Results demonstrate rapid spread of mites achieved by mite movement across open cage areas rather than direct hen contact. The repeated pattern of mite spread (appearance on a hen after mites on an adjacent hen reached moderate-to-high levels) suggests that movement within a row was probably due to mites walking on cage wires rather than dispersal on rodents or wild birds...|$|R
40|$|Avian {{incubation}} behavior {{involves a}} complex set of decisions to balance off-bouts of self-maintenance and on-bouts of egg temperature regulation. Nest ectoparasites may indirectly affect offspring fitness by directly altering the lengths and frequencies of parental on and off-bouts during incubation. Although parasites are known to impact parental care when nestlings are present, whether parental incubation behavior changes in response to nest ectoparasites is not well understood. To assess whether nest ectoparasites influence incubation behavior, I manipulated <b>northern</b> <b>fowl</b> <b>mites</b> (Ornithonyssus sylviarum) in barn swallow (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster) nests at the start of incubation. I compared disinfected and parasitized nests using model eggs with temperature data loggers to measure incubation rhythms and temperatures. The four main questions were 1) do parasites influence the duration of the incubation period 2) do parasites influence incubation rhythms 3) do parasites influence egg temperature and 4) does incubation behavior change across the incubation period. All variables of interest exhibited high variation across all three phases of incubation regardless of clutch size or treatment, indicating incubation is a highly flexible parental behavior. These results suggest parasites do not directly affect incubation behavior, however clutch size increases time on nest during the early stages of incubation. This suggests incubation is a dynamic behavior possibly constrained by parental fitness and other environmental factors, rather than nest ectoparasite intensity. Although ectoparasites are known to influence barn swallow territory choice and nestling provisioning, my results demonstrate that the presence of this ectoparasite does not influence incubation behavior...|$|R

40|$|SULFAQUINOXALINE, [N 1 —(2 quin-oxalinyl) sulfanilamide] was {{reported}} by Furman and Stratton (1963) to be ef-fective in controlling infestations of north-ern fowl mites, Ornithonyssus sylviarum (Canestrini and Fanzago). Control was ob-tained by using feed containing 0. 033 % of the drug on a continuous basis over a 5 week period. This approach to poultry ecto-parasite control is well suited for applica-tion against a pest such as the <b>northern</b> <b>fowl</b> <b>mite,</b> which frequently spends its entire life on the bird. If it does leave its host it must find another for a blood meal rather quickly. Kirkwood (1963) found that all northern fowl mites died within three weeks when deprived of a host.

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Northern</b> <b>fowl</b> <b>mite</b> {{population}} {{surveys were}} conducted in two large commercial caged-layer houses. Hens were {{selected on the basis}} of number of birds per cage. Hens caged alone were shown to support significantly larger mite populations than hens with at least one cagemate. This phenomenon can be used as a convenient survey tool when checking large poultry flocks for mite infestation, and may prove to be an important consideration in pest management programs. The <b>northern</b> <b>fowl</b> <b>mite,</b> Ornitbonyssus syl-viarum (Canestrini and Fanzago, 1877) (Aca-rina:Macronyssidae), is considered by many specialists to be the most damaging poultry ectoparasite currently present in the United States. These active, blood-feeding mites are capable of completing their life cycle without leaving the body and plumage of the host. Infestations occurring in large flocks may even-tually affect the majority of birds, but chickens with differing levels of susceptibility to north-ern fowl mites have been observed. Payne (1930) stated that occasional hens remained mite-free in infested surroundings. Loomis et al. (1970) noted this phenomenon and theorized that an immune response or hormone activity might be responsible. Environmental factors including levels of social interactions, temperature, and manage-ment techniques have been shown to influence plasma corticosterone levels in poultry (Brown and Nestor, 1970, 1974; Gross and Colmano, 1971). In general, corticosterone levels rise with increasing levels of stress. Hall and Gross (1975) demonstrated that Leghorn roosters genetically selected for high plasma corticosterone re-sponse to a 2 -week period of social stress were significantly more resistant to mite infestation than birds selected for a low corticosterone response.

Using molecular phylogenetic tools we aimed to answer two questions concerning host specificity and synanthropicity: (1) is D. gallinae the only species infesting European layer farms?, and (2) can populations of D. gallinae move from wild to domestic birds and vice versa? Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene sequences were obtained from 73 Dermanyssus populations collected from nests of wild European birds and from poultry farms and these were analyzed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. Mapping of the observed host range on the obtained topology and correlation with behavioural observations revealed that (1) host range is strongly dependent on some ecological parameters (e. g. nest hygiene, exposure to pesticides and predators), that (2) out of five species under test, synanthropic populations were found only in lineages of D. gallinae, and that (3) at least some haplotypes found in wild birds were very close to those found in association with domestic birds...|$|R
40|$|The {{subcutaneous}} acarid parasite Laminosioptes cysticola, the <b>fowl</b> cyst <b>mite,</b> {{has been}} found {{for a number of}} years in free-range chickens of peri-urban and rural Minas Gerais, forming collagen cysts which may be subsequently calcified after the parasite's death. The role of free-range chickens as hosts and the possible risk of food-borne human allergy, as a result of its consumption in feed, are considered. O parasito acarino subcutâneo Laminosioptes cysticola tem sido encontrado em galinhas de subsistência periurbanas e rurais em Minas Gerais, formando cistos arredondados que podem calcificar sob a pele após a morte do parasito. Detalhes do parasitismo e do parasito são discutidos, sendo especulado o risco potencial humano em alergia de origem alimentar pelo consumo da carne da ave contendo os cistos...|$|R
