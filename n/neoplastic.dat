5|$|Dermal and {{subcutaneous}} growths {{result from}} (1) reactive or <b>neoplastic</b> proliferation of cellular {{components of the}} dermis or subcutaneous tissue, or (2) neoplasms invading or aberrantly present in the dermis.|$|E
25|$|Tumors may {{be caused}} by {{conditions}} other than an overgrowth of <b>neoplastic</b> cells, however. Cysts (such as sebaceous cysts) are also referred to as tumors, even though they have no <b>neoplastic</b> cells. This is standard in medical billing terminology (especially when billing for a growth whose pathology has yet to be determined).|$|E
25|$|CD10 {{expression}} {{might be}} one of the characteristics of müllerian system-derived <b>neoplastic</b> mesenchymal cells.|$|E
25|$|RCD 2 {{involves}} <b>neoplastic</b> tissues {{that the}} lack of surface expression of usual T-cell markers.|$|E
25|$|Measurable disease – the {{presence}} {{of at least one}} measurable lesion. If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its <b>neoplastic</b> nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology.|$|E
25|$|Tumor (American English) or tumour (British English), Latin for swelling, {{one of the}} {{cardinal}} signs of inflammation, originally meant any form of swelling, <b>neoplastic</b> or not. Current English, however, both medical and non-medical, uses tumor as a synonym for a neoplasm (a solid or fluid-filled cystic lesion {{that may or may}} not be formed by an abnormal growth of <b>neoplastic</b> cells) that appears enlarged in size. Some neoplasms do not form a tumor; these include leukemia and most forms of carcinoma in situ. Tumor is also not synonymous with cancer. While cancer is by definition malignant, a tumor can be benign, precancerous, or malignant.|$|E
25|$|Chromosomal rearrangements {{and altered}} {{expression}} of this gene have {{been implicated in}} several neurological, <b>neoplastic,</b> {{and other types of}} diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, schwannoma, melanoma, and type I diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Germ cell {{neoplasia}} in situ, abbreviated GCNIS, {{represents the}} precursor lesion for {{many types of}} testicular germ cell tumors. As the name suggests, it represents a <b>neoplastic</b> process of germ cells that is confined to the spermatogonial niche.|$|E
25|$|A {{majority}} of histologically normal fields surrounding <b>neoplastic</b> growths (adenomas and colon cancers) in the colon also show reduced MBD4 mRNA expression (a field defect) compared to histologically normal tissue from individuals {{who never had}} a colonic neoplasm. This finding suggests that epigenetic silencing of MBD4 is an early step in colorectal carcinogenesis.|$|E
25|$|These {{neoplasms}} {{are divided}} into three categories, pineoblastomas, pineocytomas, and mixed tumours, based on their level of differentiation, which, in turn, correlates with their <b>neoplastic</b> aggressiveness. The clinical course of patients with pineocytomas is prolonged, averaging up to several years. The position of these tumours makes them very difficult to remove surgically.|$|E
25|$|Nutrition science (theoretical focus) and {{dietetics}} (practical focus) is {{the study}} of the relationship of food and drink to health and disease, especially in determining an optimal diet. Medical nutrition therapy is done by dietitians and is prescribed for diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, weight and eating disorders, allergies, malnutrition, and <b>neoplastic</b> diseases.|$|E
25|$|Pulmonary {{pathology}} is a subspecialty of anatomic (and especially surgical) pathology {{that deals}} with diagnosis and characterization of <b>neoplastic</b> and non-neoplastic diseases of the lungs and thoracic pleura. Diagnostic specimens are often obtained via bronchoscopic transbronchial biopsy, CT-guided percutaneous biopsy, or video-assisted thoracic surgery. These tests can be necessary to diagnose between infection, inflammation, or fibrotic conditions.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{specific}} miRNAs may {{be associated}} with certain histological subtypes of colorectal cancer. For instance, expression levels of miR-205 and miR-373 {{have been shown to be}} increased in mucinous colorectal cancers and mucin-producing Ulcerative Colitis-associated colon cancers, but not in sporadic colonic adenocarcinoma that lack mucinous components. In-vitro studies suggested that miR-205 and miR-373 may functionally induce different features of mucinous-associated <b>neoplastic</b> progression in intestinal epithelial cells.|$|E
25|$|The role {{of iodine}} in marine fishes (rich in iodine) and {{freshwater}} fishes (iodine-deficient) {{is not completely}} understood, {{but it has been}} reported that freshwater fishes are more susceptible to infectious and, in particular, <b>neoplastic</b> and atherosclerotic diseases, of marine fishes. Marine elasmobranch fishes such as sharks, stingrays etc. are much less affected by cancer than freshwater fishes, and therefore have stimulated medical research to better understand carcinogenesis so it can be useful in other animals and especially in humans.|$|E
25|$|Point {{mutations}} {{have been}} observed in the coding and non-coding region of the mtDNA contained in cancer cells. In individuals with bladder, head/neck and lung cancers, the point mutations within the coding region show signs of resembling each other. This suggests that when a healthy cell transforms into a tumor cell (a <b>neoplastic</b> transformation) the mitochondria seem to become homogenous. Abundant point mutations located within the non-coding region, D-loop, of the cancerous mitochondria suggest that mutations within this region might be an important characteristic in some cancers.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, globally, {{approximately}} 281,500 {{people died}} of leukemia. In 2000, approximately 256,000 {{children and adults}} around the world developed a form of leukemia, and 209,000 died from it. This represents about 3% of the almost seven million deaths due to cancer that year, and about 0.35% of all deaths from any cause. Of the sixteen separate sites the body compared, leukemia was the 12th most common class of <b>neoplastic</b> disease, and the 11th {{most common cause of}} cancer-related death. Leukemia occurs more commonly in the developed world.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 the WHO Classification of Myeloid Neoplasms was published, {{classifying}} CMML into a {{new group}} of diseases, the myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN), reflecting the disease's <b>neoplastic</b> nature. Other diseases in this category are juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia, atypical CML; BCR-ABL1 negative and MDS/MPD unclassifiable. These MDS/MPN overlap syndromes have effective production of some lineages of blood cells, but show ineffective proliferation of other lineages. The 2008 revision of the classification moved cases of CMML with PDGFR gene translocations to a new group, myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia with abnormalities of PDGFRA, PDGFRB or FGFR1.|$|E
25|$|Gastric {{squamous}} cell carcinoma is most often found in the non-glandular region of the stomach of horses greater than 5 years of age, and horses often present with weight loss, anorexia, anemia, and ptyalism. Gastric carcinoma is usually diagnosed via gastroscopy, but may sometimes be felt on rectal if they have metastasized to the peritoneal cavity. Additionally, laparoscopy can also diagnose metastasized cancer, as can presence of <b>neoplastic</b> cells on abdominocentesis. Often the signs of intestinal neoplasia are non-specific, and include weight loss and colic, usually only if obstruction of the intestinal lumen occurs.|$|E
25|$|Drug {{resistance}} {{is a common}} clinical problem that occurs in patients suffering from infectious diseases and in patients suffering from cancer. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms as well as <b>neoplastic</b> cells are often found to be resistant to drugs. MDR is frequently associated with overexpression of ABC transporters. Inhibition of ABC transporters by low-molecular weight compounds has been extensively investigated in cancer patients; however, the clinical results have been disappointing. Recently various RNAi strategies have been applied to reverse MDR in different tumor models and this technology is effective in reversing ABC-transporter-mediated MDR in cancer cells and is therefore a promising strategy for overcoming MDR by gene therapeutic applications. RNAi technology could also be considered for overcoming MDR in infectious diseases caused by microbial pathogens.|$|E
25|$|Often, the {{multiple}} genetic changes {{that result in}} cancer may take many years to accumulate. During this time, the biological behavior of the pre-malignant cells slowly change from the properties of normal cells to cancer-like properties. Pre-malignant tissue can have a distinctive appearance under the microscope. Among the distinguishing traits are an increased number of dividing cells, variation in nuclear size and shape, variation in cell size and shape, loss of specialized cell features, and loss of normal tissue organization. Dysplasia is an abnormal type of excessive cell proliferation characterized by loss of normal tissue arrangement and cell structure in pre-malignant cells. These early <b>neoplastic</b> changes must be distinguished from hyperplasia, a reversible increase in cell division caused by an external stimulus, such as a hormonal imbalance or chronic irritation.|$|E
25|$|The boron atom in bortezomib binds the {{catalytic}} {{site of the}} 26S proteasome with high affinity and specificity. In normal cells, the proteasome regulates protein expression and function by degradation of ubiquitylated proteins, and also cleanses the cell of abnormal or misfolded proteins. Clinical and preclinical data support a role in maintaining the immortal phenotype of myeloma cells, and cell-culture and xenograft data support a similar function in solid tumor cancers. While multiple mechanisms {{are likely to be}} involved, proteasome inhibition may prevent degradation of pro-apoptotic factors, thereby triggering programmed cell death in <b>neoplastic</b> cells. Recently, it was found that bortezomib caused a rapid and dramatic change in the levels of intracellular peptides that are produced by the proteasome. Some intracellular peptides {{have been shown to be}} biologically active, and so the effect of bortezomib on the levels of intracellular peptides may contribute to the biological and/or side effects of the drug.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} leukocytes {{in the blood}} is often an {{indicator}} of disease, and thus the WBC count is an important subset of the complete blood count. The normal white cell count is usually between 4 × 109/L and 11 × 109/L. In the US this is usually expressed as 4,000 to 11,000 white blood cells per microliter of blood. They make up approximately 1% of the total blood volume in a healthy adult, making them substantially less numerous than the RBCs at 40% to 45%. However, this 1% of the blood makes a large difference to health, because immunity depends on it. An {{increase in the number}} of leukocytes over the upper limits is called leukocytosis. It is normal when it is part of healthy immune responses, which happen frequently. It is occasionally abnormal, when it is <b>neoplastic</b> or autoimmune in origin. A decrease below the lower limit is called leukopenia. It weakens the immune system.|$|E
25|$|MPyV {{contains}} three proteins extensively {{studied for}} their ability to induce <b>neoplastic</b> transformation (that is, carcinogenesis); these proteins are expressed from the early region of the viral genome and are known as large, middle, and small tumor antigen. Murine polyomavirus and its close relative hamster polyomavirus are historically the only two known viruses whose genomes contain middle tumor antigen, by far the most efficient of the three early proteins at inducing carcinogenesis. In 2015 the genome sequence of a rat polyomavirus was reported to contain middle tumor antigen as well, consistent with expectations that it evolved uniquely in the rodent lineage of the polyomavirus family. Expression of MT from a transgene or introduction in cell culture can be sufficient to induce transformation. Studies using MT have played key roles in understanding host-cell oncogenes and their effects on carcinogenesis, particularly {{in the study of the}} Src family of tyrosine kinases. Transgenic mice expressing MT are widely used as models for cancer progression and metastasis, particularly of breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|While {{genetic and}} {{epigenetic}} alterations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes change {{the behavior of}} cells, those alterations, in the end, result in cancer through their effects on the population of <b>neoplastic</b> cells and their microenvironment. Mutant cells in neoplasms compete for space and resources. Thus, a clone with a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene or oncogene will expand only in a neoplasm if that mutation gives the clone a competitive advantage over the other clones and normal cells in its microenvironment. Thus, the process of carcinogenesis is formally a process of Darwinian evolution, known as somatic or clonal evolution. Furthermore, {{in light of the}} Darwinistic mechanisms of carcinogenesis, it has been theorized that the various forms of cancer can be categorized as pubertarial and gerontological. Anthropological research is currently being conducted on cancer as a natural evolutionary process through which natural selection destroys environmentally inferior phenotypes while supporting others. According to this theory, cancer comes in two separate types: from birth to the end of puberty (approximately age 20) teleologically inclined toward supportive group dynamics, and from mid-life to death (approximately age 40+) teleologically inclined away from overpopulative group dynamics.|$|E

2500|$|The two {{commonly}} used categories of {{white blood cell}} disorders divide them [...] into those causing excessive numbers (proliferative disorders) and those causing insufficient numbers (leukopenias). Leukocytosis is usually healthy (e.g., fighting an infection), but it also may be dysfunctionally proliferative. WBC proliferative disorders can be classed as myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative. Some are autoimmune, but many are <b>neoplastic.</b>|$|E

For lymphoid neoplasms, e.g. lymphoma and leukemia, clonality is proven by the amplification {{of a single}} rearrangement of their immunoglobulin gene (for B cell lesions) or T cell receptor gene (for T cell lesions). The demonstration of clonality is now considered to be necessary to identify a lymphoid cell proliferation as <b>neoplastic.</b>|$|E
