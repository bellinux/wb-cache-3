25|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>gums</b> are {{vegetable}} exudates {{that are}} released {{as the result}} of damage to the plant such as that resulting from the attack of an insect or a natural or artificial cut. These exudates contain heterogeneous polysaccharides formed of different sugars and usually containing uronic acids. They form viscous colloidal solutions. There are different species that produce gums. The most important of these species belong to the leguminosae. They are widely used in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, food and textile sectors. They also have interesting therapeutic properties; for example gum arabic is antitussive and anti-inflammatory. The most well known gums are tragacanth (Astragalus gummifer), gum arabic (Acacia senegal) and guar gum (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba).|$|E
25|$|Screw press- Grapes {{are loaded}} into an input where a large helical screw {{transfers}} the grape across perforated cylinder {{that allows the}} release juice to escape. As screw moves further down, the cake pomace is subjected to increasing pressure. While the advantage is the high throughput, the harsh pressing and lots of movement causes substantial tearing and grinding of the grape skins and seeds. This causes more minerals (such as potassium, which can affect pH), tannins and <b>natural</b> <b>gums</b> to be extracted into the juice. As much as 4% v/v of the pressed juice from a screw press could be suspended solids that {{may need to be}} treated by clarification and fining agents to be stable and filterable.|$|E
25|$|Usually the pressed juice {{will require}} some {{additional}} treatment, {{which can be}} done separately to the pressed juice alone or to the entire batch of wine if the pressed juice is blended with the free-run. These treatments may include acid adjustments to lower pH, extended settling periods for clarification and additional racking to remove the extra suspended solids {{and the use of}} fining agents to remove extra solids or excess tannins. Grape pulp contains a lot of pectins that create colloid coagulation with these solids that will make the wine difficult to stabilize. Some winemakers will use pectolytic enzymes during the maceration process to help break down the cell walls to allow the release of more juice freely. These enzymes are also used with white wines to assist in clarification. The type of pressing used and the amount of suspended solids plays a particular role in filtering decisions as a high amount of suspended solids (particularly <b>natural</b> <b>gums)</b> can clog and damage expensive filters.|$|E

50|$|The French {{settlements}} in Senegal had little strategic value, {{but they were}} important to France's global trade in slaves. They were also home to a substantial industry in <b>natural</b> <b>gums.</b> The principal object of the expedition was therefore to damage the French economy by cutting access to these industries. Such expeditions were part of Southern Secretary William Pitt's strategy of destroying France's capacity to continue the war by draining her of funds.|$|E

The pale to brownish yellow wood is used to make furniture and durable items such as tools, and it is a low-smoke firewood and good charcoal. The smaller trees and branches are used as living or cut fences because they are resilient and thorny. The tree fixes nitrogen. It is grown for its fruit in plantations in several areas. The bark yields fibers, the <b>natural</b> <b>gums</b> from the branches are used as glue, and the seeds have been used to make jewelry and beads.|$|E

50|$|British gum or dextrin is {{prepared}} by heating starch. It varies considerably in composition, sometimes being only slightly roasted and consequently only partly converted into dextrine, {{and at other}} times being highly torrefied, and almost completely soluble in cold water and very dark in colour. Its thickening power decreases and its gummy nature increases as the temperature at which it is roasted is raised. It is useful for strongly acid colours, and with the exception of gum Senegal, it is the best choice for strongly alkaline colours and discharges. Like the <b>natural</b> <b>gums,</b> it does not penetrate as well into the fibre of the cloth pr as deeply as pure starch or flour and is unsuitable for very dark, strong colours.|$|E
