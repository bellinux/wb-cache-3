2500|$|In Transylvania, {{although}} they formed {{the majority of}} the population, Romanians were merely seen as a [...] "tolerated nation" [...] by the Austrian leadership of the province, and were not proportionally represented in political life and the Transylvanian Diet. At the end of the 18th century an emancipation movement known as the Transylvanian School (Şcoala Ardeleană) formed, which tried to emphasize that the Romanian people were of Roman origin, and also adopted the modern Latin-based Romanian alphabet (which eventually supplanted an earlier Cyrillic script). It also accepted the leadership of the pope over the Romanian church of Transylvania, thus forming the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church. In 1791, they issued a petition to Emperor Leopold II of Austria, named Supplex Libellus Valachorum based on the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, demanding equal political rights with the other ethnicities for the Romanians in Transylvania. This movement, however leaned more towards westernization in general, when in fact the origin of the Romanian people is not only from the peoples of the former Roman Empire, but also from the ancient Dacians, predating the arrival of the Romans, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> from around the 1600s to the 1800s Romanian culture was heavily influenced by Eastern influences as emphasized through the Ottomans, and the Phanariotes.|$|E
2500|$|Khouri is a screenwriter, director, producer, feminist, lecturer, {{and author}} of non-fiction. She also worked as an actress, lecturer, and waiter in Nashville. While working {{for a company that}} made {{commercials}} and music videos, she began writing Thelma & Louise, her first produced screenplay. Thelma & Louise won Khouri the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, a Golden Globe Award, and a PEN Literary Award, as well as the London Film Critics Circle Award for Film of the Year and a nomination for Best Original Screenplay from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. According to an interview done by David Konow, a scholarly author and journalist, Callie Khouri mentioned her experience filming her first major film, Thelma & Louise. “While I was writing Thelma and Louise, it was the most fun I had ever had in my life, bar none,” she says. “It was such a pure experience. There was no self-censorship there, there was no second guessing. From a creative standpoint, it was the freest I had ever been in my life. I loved every moment I got to spend time with those characters. Nothing came close to it, including winning all the awards and everything else. As much fun as all that was, it wasn’t as much fun as sitting alone in a crummy office on Vine at 2 in the morning writing that screenplay.” At the Oscar ceremony she said, [...] "for everyone who wanted to see a happy ending for 'Thelma and Louise', for me this is it," [...] brandishing the statue high. After winning the Academy Awards for her best screenplay, she felt motivated enough to continue on with her career and express [...] "her feelings about the lack of female directors in Hollywood", <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> most of her career began because of her stand on women's rights. In an interview done by The Huffington Post, she addressed that adult women [...] "are a market that I feel is underserved in the entertainment population at large. I don’t see the kind of women represented that I know or that I’m attracted to. I really want to try to write more nuanced, less simplistic kind of stuff, and its hard {{to find a place to}} do that." ...|$|E
