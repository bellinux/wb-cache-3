25|$|Acetylation has {{the effect}} of {{changing}} the overall charge of the histone tail from positive to neutral. Nucleosome formation is dependent on the positive charges of the H4 histones and the negative charge on the surface of H2A histone fold domains. Acetylation of the histone tails disrupts this association, leading to weaker binding of the <b>nucleosomal</b> components. By doing this, the DNA is more accessible and leads to more transcription factors being able to reach the DNA. Thus, acetylation of histones is known to increase the expression of genes through transcription activation. Deacetylation performed by HDAC molecules has the opposite effect. By deacetylating the histone tails, the DNA becomes more tightly wrapped around the histone cores, making it harder for transcription factors to bind to the DNA. This leads to decreased levels of gene expression and is known as gene silencing.|$|E
25|$|Anti-dsDNA {{antibodies}} {{are highly}} associated with glomerulonephritis in SLE, although some patients with high titers of anti-dsDNA antibodies do not develop renal disease. This {{is most likely}} {{due to the fact}} that anti-dsDNA are a heterogeneous population, some of which have been found not to be pathogenic. Anti-dsDNA antibodies can be present in normal individuals, however these antibodies are usually low avidity IgM isotype. In contrast, pathogenic anti-dsDNA antibodies found in SLE are usually of IgG isotype and show high avidity for dsDNA. One possible mechanism for anti-dsDNA and their role in nephritis is the formation of immune complexes that arise by indirect binding to DNA or nucleosomes that are adhered to the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Another mechanism is direct binding of antibodies to GBM antigens such as C1q, <b>nucleosomal</b> proteins, heparin sulphate or laminin, which can initiate an inflammatory response by activating complement. They can also be internalised by certain molecules on the GBM cells and cause inflammatory cascades, proliferation and alteration of cellular functions.|$|E
25|$|MOZ (Monocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein), Ybf2/Sas3, Sas2 and Tip60 (Tat Interacting Protein) {{all make}} up MYST, another well known family that {{exhibits}} acetylating capabilities. This family includes Sas3, essential SAS-related acetyltransferase (Esa1), Sas2, Tip60, MOF, MOZ, MORF, and HBO1. The {{members of this}} family have multiple functions, not only with activating and silencing genes, but also affect development and have implications in human diseases. Sas2 and Sas3 are involved in transcription silencing, MOZ and TIF2 are involved {{with the formation of}} leukemic transclocation products while MOF is involved in dosage compensation in Drosophila. HAT domains for this family are approximately 250 residues which include cysteine-rich, zinc binding domains as well as N-terminal chromodomains. The MYST proteins Esa1, Sas2 and Sas3 are found in yeast, MOF is found in Drosophila while Tip60, MOZ, MORF, and HBO1 are found in humans. Tip60 has roles in the regulation of gene transcription, HBO has been found to impact the DNA replication process, MORF is able to acetylate free histones (especially H3 and H4) as well as <b>nucleosomal</b> histones.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} nuclear {{staining}} patterns seen on HEp-2 cells: homogeneous, speckled, nucleolar, nuclear membranous, centromeric, nuclear dot and pleomorphic. The homogeneous pattern is seen when the condensed chromosomes and interphase chromatin stain. This pattern {{is associated with}} anti-dsDNA antibodies, antibodies to <b>nucleosomal</b> components, and anti-histone antibodies. There are two speckled patterns: fine and coarse. The fine speckled pattern has fine nuclear staining with unstained metaphase chromatin, which is associated with anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. The coarse staining pattern has coarse granular nuclear staining, caused by anti-U1-RNP and anti-Sm antibodies. The nucleolar staining pattern is associated with many antibodies including anti-Scl-70, anti-PM-Scl, anti-fibrillarin and anti-Th/To. Nuclear membrane staining appears as a fluorescent ring around the cell nucleus and are produced by anti-gp210 and anti-p62 antibodies. The centromere pattern shows multiple nuclear dots in interphase and mitotic cells, corresponding {{to the number of}} chromosomes in the cell. Nuclear dot patterns show between 13–25 nuclear dots in interphase cells and are produced by anti-sp100 antibodies. Pleomorphic pattern is caused by antibodies to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Indirect immunofluorescence {{has been shown to be}} slightly superior compared to ELISA in detection of ANA from HEp-2 cells.|$|E
2500|$|In eukaryotes, DNA is {{organized}} {{with the help}} of histones into compact particles called nucleosomes, where sequences of about 147 DNA base pairs make ~1.65 turns around histone protein octamers. DNA within nucleosomes is inaccessible to many transcription factors. Some transcription factors, so-called pioneering factors are still able to bind their DNA binding sites on the <b>nucleosomal</b> DNA. For most other transcription factors, the nucleosome should be actively unwound by molecular motors such as chromatin remodelers. Alternatively, the nucleosome can be partially unwrapped by thermal fluctuations, allowing temporary access to the transcription factor binding site. In many cases, a transcription factor needs to compete for binding to its DNA binding site with other transcription factors and histones or non-histone chromatin proteins. [...] Pairs of transcription factors and other proteins can play antagonistic roles (activator versus repressor) in the regulation of the same gene.|$|E

50|$|The SMART {{signature}} {{describes a}} <b>nucleosomal</b> binding domain, which facilitates binding of proteins to nucleosomes in chromatin. The domain is most {{commonly found in}} the high mobility group (HMG) proteins, HMG14 and HMG17, however, it {{is also found in}} other proteins which bind to nucleosomes, e.g. NBP-45. NBP-45 is a <b>nucleosomal</b> binding protein, first identified in mice, which is related to HMG14 and HMG17. NBP-45 binds specifically to nucleosome core particles, and can function as a transcriptional activator. These findings led to the suggestion that this domain, common to NBP-45, HMG14 and HMG17 is responsible for binding of the proteins to nucleosomes in chromatin.|$|E
5000|$|HATs act as {{transcriptional}} co-activators or gene silencers and {{are most}} often found in large complexes made up of 10 to 20 subunits, some of which shared among different HAT complexes. [...] These complexes include SAGA (Spt/Ada/Gcn5L acetyltransferase), PCAF, ADA (transcriptional adaptor), TFIID (transcription factor II D), TFTC (TBP-free TAF-containing complex), and NuA3/NuA4 (<b>nucleosomal</b> acetyltransferases of H3 and H4). [...] These complexes modulate HAT specificity by bringing HATs to their target genes where they can then acetylate <b>nucleosomal</b> histones. [...] Some HAT transcriptional co-activators contain a bromodomain, a 110-amino acid module that recognizes acetylated lysine residues and is functionally linked to the co-activators in the regulation of transcription.|$|E

[...] In vitro, {{they have been}} {{observed}} to acetylate H2AK5, H2BK12, H2BK15, H3K14, H3K18, H4K5, and H4K8. [...] SRC-1 acetylates H3K9 and H3K14, TAFII230 (Drosophila homolog of human TAFII250) acetylates H3K14, and Rtt109 acetylates H3K9, H3K23, [...] and H3K56 {{in the presence of}} either Asf1 or Vps75.|$|E
50|$|Thus in his wedge model, Trifonov {{supposed}} that each combination of neighboring base pairs form {{a certain angle}} (specific for these base pairs). He called this feature curvature. Moreover, he suggested {{that in addition to}} curvature, each base pairs step could be deformed to different extent being bound to the histone octamer and he called it bending. These two features of DNA present in the nucleosomes - curvature and bending have been now considered major factors playing a role in the nucleosome positioning. Periodicity of other dinucleotides were confirmed later by Alexander Bolshoy and co-workers. Finally, an ideal sequence of the <b>nucleosomal</b> DNA was derived in 2009 by Gabdank, Barash and Trifonov. The proposed sequence CGRAAATTTYCG (R standing for a purine: A or G, Y for a pyrimidine: C or T) expresses the preferential order of the dinucleotides in the sequence of the <b>nucleosomal</b> DNA. However, these inferences are disputed by some scientists.|$|E
50|$|In {{genetics}} a {{hypersensitive site}} is a short region of chromatin and is detected by its super sensitivity to cleavage by DNase I and other various nucleases (DNase II and micrococcal nucleases). In a hypersensitive site, the <b>nucleosomal</b> structure is less compacted, increasing {{the availability of the}} DNA to binding by proteins, such as transcription factors and DNase I. These sites account for many inherited tendencies.|$|E
50|$|RSC (Remodelling the Structure of Chromatin) is {{a member}} of the ATP-dependent {{chromatin}} remodeller family (other members being the SWI/SNF, INO80, ISW1 and CHD complexes). RSC consists of 17 subunits and exhibits a DNA-dependent ATPase activity stimulated by both free and <b>nucleosomal</b> DNA and a capacity to perturb nucleosome structures. It is at least 10-fold more abundant than the SWI/SNF complex and is essential for mitotic growth.|$|E
5000|$|In flies, {{acetylation}} of H4K16 on {{the male}} X chromosome by MOF {{in the context}} of the MSL complex is correlated with transcriptional upregulation as a mechanism for dosage compensation in these organisms. [...] In humans, the MSL complex carries out the majority of genome-wide H4K16 acetylation. In the context of their cognate complexes, Sas2 (SAS) and Esa1 (NuA4) also carry out acetylation of H4K16, in particular in the telomere regions of chromosomes. Sas2 is also observed to acetylate H3K14 in vitro on free histones. [...] Esa1 can also acetylate H3K14 in vitro on free histones as well as H2AK5, H4K5, H4K8, and H4K12 either in vitro or in vivo on <b>nucleosomal</b> histones. H2AK7 and H2BK16 are also observed to be acetylated by Esa1 in vivo. Notably, neither Sas2 nor Esa1 can acetylate <b>nucleosomal</b> histones in vitro as a free enzyme. This happens to be the case as well for Sas3, which is observed to acetylate H3K9 and H3K14 in vivo as well as lysine residues on H2A and H4. MOZ can also acetylate H3K14.|$|E
50|$|Histone {{acetylation}} plays a {{key role}} in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. Histone acetylation and deacetylation are catalyzed by multisubunit complexes. The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the histone deacetylase complex, which includes SIN3A, SAP18, HDAC1, HDAC2, RbAp46, RbAp48, and other polypeptides. This complex is active in deacetylating core histone octamers, but inactive in deacetylating <b>nucleosomal</b> histones. A pseudogene of this gene is located on chromosome 3.|$|E
5000|$|Gcn5 cannot acetylate <b>nucleosomal</b> histones in {{the absence}} of other protein factors. [...] In the context of {{complexes}} like SAGA and ADA, however, Gcn5 is able to acetylate H3K14 among other sites within histones H2B, H3, and H4 (e.g., H3K9, H3K36, H4K8, H4K16). [...] Both Gcn5 and PCAF have the strongest site preference for H3K14, either as a free histone or within a nucleosome. [...] Hat1 acetylates H4K5 and H4K12, and Hpa2 acetylates H3K14 in vitro.|$|E
50|$|Chromosomal protein HMG14 and {{its close}} analog HMG17 (MIM 163910) bind {{to the inner}} side of the <b>nucleosomal</b> DNA, {{potentially}} altering {{the interaction between the}} DNA and the histone octamer. The 2 proteins may be involved in the process that maintains transcribable genes in a unique chromatin conformation. Their ubiquitous distribution and relative abundance, as well as the high evolutionary conservation of the DNA-binding domain of the HMG14 family of proteins, suggest that they may be involved in an important cellular function.|$|E
50|$|Another {{question}} {{closely related}} to the chromatin structure which Trifonov pursued to answer was the length of the DNA helical repeat (turn) within nucleosomes. It is known that in free DNA (i.e. DNA which is not part of a nucleosome), the DNA helix twists 360° per approximately 10.5 bp. In 1979, Trifonov and Thomas Bettecken estimated the length of a <b>nucleosomal</b> DNA repeat to be 10.33-10.4 bp. This value was finally confirmed and refined to 10.4 bp with crystallographic analysis in 2006.|$|E
50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} {{is a type}} B histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that is {{involved}} in the rapid acetylation of newly synthesized cytoplasmic histones, which are, in turn, imported into the nucleus for de novo deposition onto nascent DNA chains. Histone acetylation, in particular, of histone H4, {{plays an important role in}} replication-dependent chromatin assembly. To be specific, this HAT can acetylate soluble but not <b>nucleosomal</b> histone H4 at lysines 5 and 12, and, to a lesser degree, histone H2A at lysine 5.|$|E
50|$|High {{mobility}} group (HMG) proteins {{constitute a}} family of relatively low molecular weight non-histone components in chromatin. HMG14 and HMG17 are highly-similar proteins of about 100 amino acid residues; the sequence of chicken HMG14 is almost as similar to chicken HMG17 {{as it is to}} mammalian HMG14 polypeptides. The proteins bind to the inner side of the <b>nucleosomal</b> DNA, altering the interaction between the DNA and the histone octamer. It is thought that they may be involved in the process that confers specific chromatin conformations to transcribable regions in the genome.|$|E
50|$|HAMLET also targets the nucleus, {{where it}} interacts with histones to {{interfere}} with transcriptional processes. Studies have shown that HAMLET is mostly localized to the nucleus within one hour of invading a tumor cell. Hamlet {{has been shown to}} bind with high affinity to individual histone proteins, to be specific H2a, H2b, H3, and H4, as well as entire <b>nucleosomal</b> units. This interaction irreversibly blocks transcription and leads to activation of p53. This process has been demonstrated to be similar to histone hyperacetylation and it was found that histone de-acetylase inhibitors potentiated the effects of HAMLET.|$|E
50|$|HP1 binding {{affinity}} to nucleosomes containing histone H3 methylated at lysine K9 {{is higher}} than to those with unmethylated lysine K9. HP1 binds nucleosomes as a dimer and in principle can form multimeric complexes. Some studies have interpreted HP1 binding in terms of nearest-neighbor cooperative binding. This mode of chromatin interactions could potentially lead to spreading of HP1 along the nucleosome chain. However, the analysis of available data on HP1 binding to <b>nucleosomal</b> arrays in vitro shows that experimental HP1 binding isotherms {{can be explained by}} a simple model without cooperative interactions between neighboring HP1 dimers.|$|E
50|$|Apoptotic DNA {{fragmentation}} is {{a natural}} fragmentation that cells perform in apoptosis (programmed cell death). DNA fragmentation is a biochemical hallmark of apoptosis. In dying cells, DNA is cleaved by an endonuclease that fragments the chromatin into <b>nucleosomal</b> units, which are multiples of about 180-bp oligomers and appear as a DNA ladder when run on an agarose gel. The enzyme responsible for apoptotic DNA fragmentation is the Caspase-activated DNase. CAD is normally inhibited by another protein, the Inhibitor of Caspase Activated DNase (ICAD). During apoptosis, the apoptotic effector caspase, caspase 3, cleaves ICAD and thus causes CAD to become activated.|$|E
5000|$|The {{formation}} of multisubunit complexes {{has been observed}} to modulate the substrate specificity of HATs. [...] In general, while recombinant HATs are able to acetylate free histones, HATs can acetylate <b>nucleosomal</b> histones only {{when they are in}} their respective in vivo HAT complexes. [...] Some of the proteins that associate with HATs in these complexes function by targeting the HAT complex to nucleosomes at specific regions in the genome. [...] For instance, it has been observed that HAT complexes (e.g. SAGA, NuA3) often use methylated histones as docking sites so that the catalytic HAT subunit can carry out histone acetylation more effectively.|$|E
