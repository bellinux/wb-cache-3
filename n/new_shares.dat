5|$|Small Heath F.C. {{became a}} limited company in 1888; its first share issue {{was to the}} value of £650. The board was made up of local {{businessmen}} and dignitaries until 1965, when the club was sold to Clifford Coombs. By the mid-1980s the club was in financial trouble. Control passed from the Coombs family to former Walsall F.C. chairman Ken Wheldon, who cut costs, made redundancies, and sold off assets, including the club's training ground. Still unable to make the club pay, Wheldon sold it to the Kumar brothers, owners of a clothing chain. Debt was still increasing when matters came to a head; the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) put the Kumars' businesses into receivership. The club continued in administration for four months until Sport Newspapers' proprietor David Sullivan bought the Kumars' 84% holding for £700,000 from BCCI's liquidator in March 1993. Birmingham City plc, of which the football club was a wholly owned subsidiary, was floated on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in 1997 with an issue of 15million <b>new</b> <b>shares,</b> raising £7.5million of new investment. It made a pre-tax profit of £4.3M in the year ending 31 August 2008.|$|E
25|$|Norske Skog {{considered}} both {{selling its}} shares in NorskeCanada or developing the company further. The latter was chosen, resulting in NorskeCanada purchasing Pacifica Papers on 27 August 2001, giving it control over Port Alberni Mill and Powell River Mill. Two months previously Pacifica Papers had sold Mackenzie Mill. The Pacifica Papers acquisition was funded through the issuing of <b>new</b> <b>shares,</b> diluting Norske Skog's ownership to 36.1 percent.

On 1 October 1975 the Statutory Company created a further 24,000 <b>new</b> <b>shares,</b> bringing its issued capital up to £75,000 in £1 shares.

25|$|By 1919 {{the company}} was still not back in production. SS Sydvaranger and several {{locomotives}} were sold to raise capital, and the share capital was depreciated by fifty percent to NOK11.5million, <b>new</b> <b>shares</b> were sold for this amount and bonds were issued for NOK10million. This was not sufficient to save the company's finances, and after negotiations with the creditors, Sydvaranger amortized its shares to NOK3.45million and sold <b>new</b> <b>shares</b> worth NOK21.55million. The company introduced a new production method using sintering, but returned to briquettes from 1926. The company {{was struck by a}} major strike in 1921, which stopped part of the production. By the following year the surplus of export products was down to the pre-war levels and the company had 896 employees. The company also started a policy to lend money to employees to allow them to build their own houses.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1890s Oslo had three private tram companies, of which two, Kristiania Sporveisselskab and Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei, {{operated}} each their network of street trams. This {{led to a}} debate of whether tram operation should be a private or a municipal affair. The two dominant parties too each their stand: the Conservative Party wished to retain the private operations, while the Liberal Party supported a municipalization of the operations. The issue was split: Oslo Municipality taking over the existing two companies and establishing a new company to operate new lines. The municipality had in 1896 been offered to purchase KSS for its nominal share value plus interest in a move initiated by the tram company itself. Its main concern was its concession would expire in 1905 and that the municipality would then have the right expropriate it. Meanwhile, the company {{was in need of}} new capital and offered to issue <b>new</b> <b>shares</b> to the municipality. Oslo Municipality rejected the offer and the <b>new</b> <b>shares</b> were instead sold to Gesellschaft für elektrische Unternehmungen of Berlin.|$|E

25|$|From the issuer's perspective, the {{key benefit}} of raising money by selling {{convertible}} bonds is a reduced cash interest payment. The advantage for companies of issuing convertible bonds is that, if the bonds are converted to stocks, companies' debt vanishes. However, {{in exchange for}} the benefit of reduced interest payments, the value of shareholder's equity is reduced due to the stock dilution expected when bondholders convert their bonds into <b>new</b> <b>shares.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to a European Commission working paper, {{empirical}} {{studies show that}} the UK stamp duty influences the share prices negatively. More frequently traded shares are stronger affected than low-turnover shares. Therefore, the tax revenue capitalizes at least to some extent in lower current share prices. For firms which rely on equity as marginal source of finance this may increase capital costs since the issue price of <b>new</b> <b>shares</b> would be lower than without the tax.|$|E
25|$|Higher {{conversion}} price than a rights issue strike price. Similarly, the {{conversion price}} a company fixes on a convertible can {{be higher than}} the level that the share price ever reached recently. Compare the equity dilution on a convertible issued on, say, a 20 or 30pct premium to the higher equity dilution on a rights issue, when the <b>new</b> <b>shares</b> are offered on, say, a 15 to 20pct discount to the prevailing share price.|$|E

Total costs reached NOK2 billion. A quarter of this was financed through issuing <b>new</b> <b>shares.</b>|$|E
25|$|By 1800, Fletcher {{was worried}} that he might lose his job, {{as a result of}} the {{shortage}} of funds and the levels of compensation paid to landowners. He therefore asked Rennie if he could move on, and in 1801 obtained a post as Superintendent for the construction of Union Bridge in Aberdeen. The project was facing severe financial difficulty and another Act was submitted to Parliament. In the Act, dated 24 March 1801, the company noted that of the £20,000 authorized by the previous Act, only £17,800 had been subscribed. They obtained powers to raise another £20,000, in £20 shares, on which interest at five per cent would be paid. The preamble to the Act stated that much of the canal had been completed, but that the company had tried and failed to raise any more money. Interest on the <b>new</b> <b>shares</b> would be paid once receipts from the tolls allowed, and the full five per cent would be paid before any returns were made against the original shares. The company hoped to sell the <b>new</b> <b>shares</b> to the existing shareholders, but not all of them were keen to expand their holdings. A public sale of shares in September 1801 raised £11,421.|$|E
