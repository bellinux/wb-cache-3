25|$|The {{other main}} match {{on the card}} was Randy Orton versus Rey Mysterio for Mysterio's world {{championship}} match at WrestleMania 22. Their match stemmed from the Royal Rumble, the pay-per-view three weeks before No Way Out. At the Royal Rumble, Mysterio won the 2006 Royal Rumble match and a world championship match at WrestleMania 22 by last eliminating Randy Orton. On the February 3 episode of SmackDown!, Orton claimed that there's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> beat him in a normal match and that he won the match because of some divine intervention. Orton then challenged Mysterio to a match at No Way Out for his title match at WrestleMania 22, and claimed that Eddie Guerrero was not in heaven, but in hell. Later that night, Orton along with Mark Henry defeated Mysterio and Kurt Angle. Midway through the match, Davari confronted Angle and was chased outside the ring and into the crowd. Henry followed, leaving Mysterio and Orton on their own. Orton gained the pinfall after sitting on Mysterio. After the match, Orton claimed that Mysterio had as much chance of defeating him as Guerrero did of coming back to life. Mysterio responded by accepting Orton's challenge on behalf of Guerrero. The next week on SmackDown!, Orton {{set the record straight}} about the comments he made about Eddie Guerrero. Backstage, he said that he only made the comments to get inside Mysterio's head, and {{that he did not know}} or care if Guerrero was in Hell. Orton later entered the arena in a lowrider to further explain his actions, and read an excerpt from Guerrero's book, Cheating Death, Stealing Life – The Eddie Guerrero Story, but Mysterio attacked him, dropkicking his head into the steel ringpost. On the February 17 episode of SmackDown!, Mysterio faced off against Sylvan, which Mysterio won after a West Coast Pop. After the match, Orton came out and said that Mysterio would never main event WrestleMania, he would never become World Champion and that he could never beat him.|$|E

2500|$|In July 1951, the American diplomat Averell Harriman went to Iran to {{negotiate}} an Anglo-Iranian compromise, asking the Shah's help; his reply was that [...] "in {{the face of}} public opinion, there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> say a word against nationalisation".

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, Carpenter {{decided that the}} Phillies needed a new home.

[...] The stadium didn't have nearly enough parking, and the neighborhood around it had already gone to seed. [...] To that end, he sold the park to Philadelphia Eagles owner Jerry Wolman in 1964, taking a million-dollar loss on his purchase of just 10 years earlier. [...] The Phillies remained at the old stadium until 1970. [...] In the last game played there, the Phillies avoided last place by beating the Expos 2–1.|$|E
2500|$|Kerry’s {{crew members}} who were there that day {{do not agree with}} Elliott’s {{characterization}} of the event in his 2004 affidavits. They contend that the enemy soldier, although wounded, was still a threat. For example, one of them, Fred Short, said, [...] "The guy was getting ready to stand up with a rocket on his shoulder, coming up. And Mr. Kerry took him out... he would have been about a 30-yard shot... here's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> miss us." [...] Del Sandusky, Kerry’s second in command, described the consequences to the lightly armored Swift Boat: [...] "Charlie would have lit us up like a Roman candle because we're full of fuel, we're full of ammunition." [...] Another witness stated that the VC [...] "had an entry wound at the side of his chest and exit wound at {{the opposite side of the}} chest cavity, a wound that was consistent with reports of the man turning to fire a second B-40 rocket." ...|$|E

However, post- Union-Pacific, “since {{it is hard to imagine}} that Sam could have used up all of his gold before he started train robbing again, it lends credence to the story that Sam robbed for sport more than for profit” (“City of Round Rock”).With the robbery of the Union Pacific, Bass transformed into a bona fide outlaw, from for-profit to for-pleasure robbery.|$|R

Thomas Roche informed the Duke of Ormonde {{that there was}} <b>no</b> <b>way</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hold the fort against Cromwell {{and that he would}} have to surrender as there were no provisions coming into the fort. The Duke of Ormonde then sent Edward Wogan, himself a defector from Ireton's ranks under Cromwell, along with 120 cavalry to replace Roche. They arrived just in time to save the fort and sent a defiant answer to Cromwell and he abandoned the siege rather than pursue it through the Winter. This saved Waterford from occupation by Oliver Cromwell's army. See main article: Siege of Waterford.|$|R
