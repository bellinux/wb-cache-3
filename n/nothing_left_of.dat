25|$|The trifolium villa, {{named after}} a clover-shaped room that was without a doubt used as a triclinium, is the largest private house {{excavated}} so far at Dougga. The house had two storeys, but there is almost <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> the upper storey. It stands {{in the south of}} the city, halfway up the hill. The house is particularly interesting because {{of the way in which}} it is built to align with the lay of the land; the entrance hall slopes down to a courtyard around which the various rooms were arranged.|$|E

25|$|The {{fireball}} {{rose above}} the houses and moved toward the nearby Glasgow–Carlisle A74 dual carriageway, scorching cars in the southbound lanes and leading motorists and local residents {{to believe that there}} had been a meltdown at the nearby Chapelcross nuclear power station. Father Patrick Keegans, Lockerbie's Roman Catholic priest, was preparing to visit his neighbours Dora and Maurice Henry at approximately 7 pm that evening, after the aircraft wing destroyed their home; there was <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> their bodies to bury. Keegans' house at 1 Sherwood Crescent was the only one on the street that was neither destroyed by the impact nor gutted by fire.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese {{were the}} first colonists to settle in Colombo; {{establishing}} a small trading post, they had laid the foundations for a small fort which in time became the largest colonial fort in the island. The Dutch expanded the fort thus creating a well old fortified harbour. This came into the possession of the British in the late 1700s and by the late 19th century the seeing no threat to the Colombo Harbour, began demolishing the ramparts {{to make way for}} the development of the city. Although now there is <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> the fortifications, the area which was once the fort is still referred to as Fort. The area outside is Pettah or පිටකොටුව in Sinhalese which means outer fort.|$|E
25|$|Study and Core Area {{boundaries}} {{delineate the}} historical extents of a battlefield. POTNR boundaries delineate areas within the Study and Core Area(s) that still retain integrity and {{remain to be}} preserved. The Study and Core Area boundaries define the historic landscape of the battlefield while areas that retain integrity define the modern landscape. For example, if a particular farm field was important during the battle but now is covered by a housing development, {{it would still be}} included in a Core or Study Area boundary because the farm field informs the history of the battle. That same farm field, however, would not be considered for inclusion in an POTNR boundary because it no longer has integrity (i.e. conveys a sense of the historic scene) and there is <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> the original farm field to preserve.|$|E

500|$|A {{series of}} levees on the park's eastern border marks {{the line between}} urban and {{protected}} areas, but development into these areas threatens the park system. Florida still attracts nearly a thousand new residents every day, and building residential, commercial and industrial zones near Everglades National Park stresses the water balance and ecosystems within the park. On the park's western border, Fort Myers, Naples and Cape Coral are expanding, but no system of levees exists to mark that border. National Geographic rated both Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve the lowest-scoring parks in North America, at 32 out of 100. Their scoring system rated 55parks in terms of sustainable tourism, destination quality, and park management. The experts who compiled the results justified the score by stating: [...] "Encroachment by housing and retail development has thrown the precious ecosystem into a tailspin, and if humankind doesn't back off, there will be <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> one of this country's most amazing treasures".|$|E

Both remaining Portals are fenced off from the road, and a sign reading [...] "Marie's Place" [...] hangs over the gate to the Inner Portal, on a ridge just north of State Route 211. A small cemetery holds five graves.|$|E
2500|$|One early recruit to {{join the}} {{regiment}} was named Jack Jackson. Jackson {{was said to be}} very large and strong-willed and quickly became a Sergeant in Company B. At some point Jackson joined the regimental recruiting parties; the officers were having trouble with convincing local field hands to join. Jackson's recruiting method was described as very forceful but ultimately successful. At the Battle of Milliken's Bend one of Jackson´s superior officers, Lieutenant David Cornwell, described the attack; saying that the 23rd Iowa was not behaving courageously but the three black infantry regiments offered great resistance. He said that Jackson, [...] "Laid into a group of Texans... smashing in every head he could reach", and that, [...] "Big Jack Jackson passed me like a rocket. With the fury of a tiger he sprang into that gang and crushed everything before him. There was <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> Jack's gun except the barrel and he was smashing everything he could reach. On {{the other side of the}} levee, they were yelling 'Shoot that big !' while Jack was daring the whole gang to come up and fight him. Then a bullet reached his head and he fell full on the levee." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1973 she was {{a student}} at the University of the Witwatersrand when she met her first husband, the finance magnate and art collector, Gordon Schachat. They married in Mauritius in 1982 and shared a home {{together}} in Linksfield Ridge, an upscale Jewish area in Johannesburg's northern suburbs. Their two-year marriage ended in divorce in 1984. Allan attributed her burgeoning career as a factor: [...] "I was obsessed with my column. I was intent on becoming the best journalist in the country." [...] They remained friends and Schachat supported Allan's testimony in the 1992 libel suit she brought against Channel 4 in London. Allan told a London court that eight years after their marriage breakup, Schachat was her closest friend and described their union as [...] "the right people at the wrong time." [...] Allan writes about the marriage to Schachat in her 2015 memoir, Jani Confidential: [...] "I keep thinking about what happened and what I would have done differently. Pretty much everything I suppose. Gordon had to live through the weekly angst about the column. It was like reinventing the wheel every week. My validity as a partner hinged - or so I thought - on my success as a columnist. I couldn't have got it more wrong. The column was the all-consuming Moloch, when it had been put to bed, there was <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> me." ...|$|E
