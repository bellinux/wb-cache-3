50|$|The diet of the <b>northern</b> <b>madtom</b> {{consists}} of small insects and invertebrates. However, because {{the species is}} found in such small numbers, no real evidence supports the specifics of their diet. Little is known as to the quality or quantity of what the <b>northern</b> <b>madtom</b> eats.|$|E
50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>madtom</b> (Noturus stigmosus) is a {{freshwater}} fish.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>madtom</b> is {{also found}} along the Allegheny River system running from Canada through the Northeast United States to Tennessee. However, over much of its range, the species is found {{in only a few}} streams/creeks in each state. In Canada, the species is {{confined}} to only four distinct locations: St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, Thames River, and Detroit River. [...] The population status of these four locations has been classified as poor by the Canada Fisheries and Oceans department. In Pennsylvania, the <b>northern</b> <b>madtom</b> is only found in one creek on the far western edge of the state. Because of this restricted distribution across most of its range, the species has been labeled as critically imperiled. In Tennessee, the species is more common and is classified as vulnerable, instead. However, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency places the <b>northern</b> <b>madtom</b> on the “Wildlife in Need of Management Proclamation” list. The sporadic distribution of the species across its range suggests that the <b>northern</b> <b>madtom</b> probably has very specific habitat requirements, so is vulnerable to habitat alterations.|$|E
5000|$|The {{life span}} of the female Proterorhinus semilunaris can be up to 5 years. Meanwhile, the males {{generally}} do not live as long. The males will guard their nesting sites to defend their eggs and young. [...] Tubenose gobies will nest under logs and rocks in the shallow fresh waters of the Great Lakes and their connecting rivers. The gobies will spawn multiple times during the warmer {{months of the year}} which makes the species rather prolific. Currently, the species is not rapidly spreading but the prolific spawning could create a threat to the native species of Rainbow Darters and <b>Northern</b> <b>Madtoms.</b>|$|R
50|$|The North American tubenose gony has a {{significant}} overlap in diet with the rainbow darter, <b>northern</b> <b>madtom,</b> and the logperch, which creates competition with these species in their native habitat.|$|E
5000|$|Noturus stigmosus {{is listed}} as “vulnerable” on the federal level. However, {{throughout}} {{the majority of its}} distribution, especially in the northern region, many states have it classified as “critically imperiled”. The reason for this is the sporadic distribution and small numbers associated with the species. These characteristics also show that the <b>northern</b> <b>madtom</b> probably has very specific habitat parameters is probably very sensitive to habitat alterations. One of the main causes for the decline of the <b>northern</b> <b>madtom</b> is loss of suitable habitat. Several factors contribute to this, ranging from the changing of the landscape for anthropogenic purposes to the building of small dams in the creeks where the species occurs. Increases in the amount of stream siltation are also believed to have negative impacts on the species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>madtom</b> {{is found}} in {{different}} habitats throughout its range. In the northern extent of its distribution, the species is found more in larger rivers and even in a few lentic environments such as Lake St. Clair. However, in the lower most stretches of its range, such as in Tennessee, the species is generally more common in small creeks and streams with a somewhat moderate current. Across all regions, the species tends to prefer habitat with sand, gravel, or rock substrates. The species is somewhat tolerant of turbidity, but avoids areas of high siltation. The <b>northern</b> <b>madtom</b> shares its habitat with several similar species ranging from the very similar mountain madtom to some invasive species, which create competition for both food and resources. However, not much {{is known about the}} specifics of the effect of this competition on the northern madtoms because they are found in such small numbers.|$|E
50|$|N. stigmosus can {{be found}} in the Ohio River valley {{stretching}} into distinct locations in Canada, where it is considered endangered. It is a fairly rare species with little data available because such small numbers are observed. The <b>northern</b> <b>madtom</b> prefers habitats with relatively swift currents along with sand, silt, or rocky substrates. The species begins spawning around 23°C, which is sometime in early summer throughout its range. It is a cavity nester and builds its nests under large rocks and logs. Presently, not much is known about the ecology or life history of this species because it is found in such small numbers throughout its range.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mountain}} madtom has a broad distribution. Its native range includes larger {{streams of}} the Mississippi River drainage for the Little River system of southeastern Oklahoma northeastward. [...] East of the Mississippi it appears through the Ohio drainage to western Pennsylvania. In the south-east {{it occurs in}} the Cumberland and Tennessee drainages. In the Tennessee, Cumberland, and Green systems it is confined to the Highland Rim. It {{is also found in}} the North Fork Holston, Clinch, and Powell rivers. Generally the mountain madtom is restricted to ridge and valley areas. In the Ohio river basin the mountain madtom and the <b>northern</b> <b>madtom</b> occur in very similar environments but usually not together. It is not found on the Cumberland Plateau or the high reaches on the Blue Ridge mountain streams, due to large boulders found in the streams that lack vegetation. It is not generally found in glaciated regions, nor is it found with any other madtom species except the pygmy madtom (Noturus stanauli).|$|E
5000|$|Both sexes of N. stigmosus {{come into}} {{reproductive}} condition in early summer. However, spawning {{does not take}} place until the water temperature reaches 23°C. [...] The species is thought to produce only one clutch per year with an average clutch size of 32 to 160 eggs. The wide range of clutch size can possibly be caused by females laying eggs in multiple nests. The <b>northern</b> <b>madtom</b> is a cavity-nesting species; they {{have been found in}} depressions under large rocks, logs, and inside crayfish burrows. Their nests have also been found inside anthropogenic debris such as bottles, cans, and boxes. [...] Males guard the eggs, and when the eggs hatch, the adult males continue to guard them for around one month. In Canada, the juveniles are found mainly in areas with a water temperature between 19.5 and 28°C, a pH of 8.03 to 8.47, a dissolved oxygen content between 6.0 and 10.05, a depth between 0.06 and 0.90 meters, and a near bottom velocity between 0 and 0.55 meters per second. Although this sounds like very specific data, the many species fall into this data set, and {{little is known about the}} specifics of the northern madtom’s life history.|$|E
40|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>madtom</b> (Noturus stigmosus) {{is a small}} Ictalurid catfish {{historically}} {{found in}} isolated populations throughout Western Lake Erie and the Ohio River Basin. Until recently, <b>northern</b> <b>madtom</b> were considered extirpated from most of their historic range in Michigan; however, monitoring of constructed spawning reefs in the St. Clair Detroit River System revealed <b>northern</b> <b>madtom</b> on and near these new reefs. <b>Northern</b> <b>madtom</b> are vulnerable to extinction due to their rare occurrence and {{lack of knowledge about}} their habitat requirements. I investigated selected reefs and rocky substrate sites in the Detroit River and the St. Clair River Delta to determine the presence and abundance of <b>northern</b> <b>madtom.</b> Overall, I collected thirty-seven northern madtoms in 2013 and 2014, and was also able to use data from another twenty-six fish collected in a previous study in 2011. <b>Northern</b> <b>madtom</b> abundance and occurrence was highly correlated (Pearson, r = 0. 803) to preferred locations based on a habitat suitability index using bathymetry and surface current velocity. There was no correlation between age of reef and abundance of <b>northern</b> <b>madtom.</b> However, <b>northern</b> <b>madtom</b> were only observed in close proximity to rocky substrate which supports the notion that they prefer rocky substrate and constructed spawning reefs are helping their populations to recover. I also aged otoliths, pectoral spines, and dorsal spines from northern madtom; ages observed ranged from one to five years. A Von Bertalanffy growth curve was fit to the estimated ages and measured total lengths (mm); results were an asymptotic length (∞) equal to 142 mm and growth rate (K) equal to 0. 4025. I collected five <b>northern</b> <b>madtom</b> that were not aged; these were smaller than the estimated at age one total length (67 mm), which shows evidence of natural reproduction occurring in these waters...|$|E
40|$|The Tennessee River Basin is {{considered}} one of the most important regions for freshwater biodiversity anywhere on the globe. The Tennessee River Basin currently includes populations of at least half of the described contemporary diversity of extant North American freshwater fishes, crayfish, mussel, and gastropod species. However, comparatively little is known about the biodiversity of this basin from the Pleistocene Epoch, particularly the late Pleistocene (∼ 10, 000 to 30, 000 years B. P.) leading to modern Holocene fish diversity patterns. The objective of this study was to describe the fish assemblages of the Tennessee River Basin from the late Pleistocene using a series of faunas from locales throughout the basin documented from published literature, unpublished reports, and an undocumented fauna from Bell Cave (site ACb- 2, Colbert County, AL). Herein we discuss 41 unequivocal taxa from 10 late Pleistocene localities within the basin and include a systematic discussion of 11 families, 19 genera, and 24 identifiable species (28 unequivocal taxa) specific to the Bell Cave locality. Among the described fauna are several extirpated (e. g., Northern Pike Esox lucius, <b>Northern</b> <b>Madtom</b> Noturus stigmosus) and a single extinct (Harelip Sucker Moxostoma lacerum) taxa that suggest a combination of late Pleistocene displacement events coupled with more recent changes in habitat that have resulted in modern basin diversity patterns. The Bell Cave locality represents one of the most intact Pleistocene freshwater fish deposits anywhere in North America. Significant preservational, taphonomic, sampling, and identification biases preclude the identification of additional taxa. Overall, this study provides a detailed look into paleo-river ecology, as well as freshwater fish diversity and distribution leading up to the contemporary biodiversity patterns of the Tennessee River Basin and Mississippi River Basin as a whole...|$|E
40|$|Round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) {{were first}} {{documented}} within the St. Clair River in 1990, and subsequently impacted native benthic fishes, including sculpins and darters, through direct predation and competition for space and prey. In {{order to identify}} long-term impacts on fish species associated with the round goby invasion in the St. Clair River, Michigan, I compared fish community composition and diet overlap between round goby and native species in 1994 with similar data from 2011. All fish were collected by trawls (3 -, 5 -, 7 -, 9 -, 11 -m depths) and seines (1 m) in May, July, and September 2011, and compared to similar data collected in May, June, and September 1994. Catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) for rainbow darter (Etheostoma caeruleum) and round goby significantly decreased in the nearshore zone between 1994 and 2011. In the offshore zone, relative abundance of <b>northern</b> <b>madtom</b> (Noturus stigmosus) decreased significantly between 1994 and 2011, while round goby relative abundance both increased and decreased, depending on month. CPUE of channel darter (Percina copelandi), johnny darter (Etheostoma nigrum), mottled sculpin (Cottus bardii), and round goby also significantly decreased in the offshore zone between 1994 and 2011. There was significant diet overlap between round gobies and native rainbow darter in 1994, suggesting diet overlap and competition for food contributed to rainbow darter population declines in the St. Clair River from 1994 to 2011. However, significant diet overlap was also found in both years between round goby and other native species that did not decline from 1994 to 2011. In 2011, round gobies showed significant diet overlap with rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) in the nearshore zone, and significant overlap with logperch (Percina caprodes) and trout-perch (Percopsis omiscomaycus) in the offshore zone. In 1994, reliance on zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) by adult round goby prevented frequent significant diet overlap from occurring between large round gobies and native species that could not consume zebra mussels, but in 2011, round gobies, logperch, and trout-perch all consumed quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis). These results suggest that differential foraging strategies allowed some native fish to forage without competition from round goby, and that the negative impacts of the round goby invasion and establishment on fish species diversity within the St. Clair River may be isolated to a few species, and due to competition for other resources, such as space. Establishment of the round goby within Great Lakes tributaries, nearshore environments, and more recently the Mississippi River basin will likely have differing impacts on native fish communities based on the pre-existing communities, other environmental stressors, and foraging habits of native fishes...|$|E
