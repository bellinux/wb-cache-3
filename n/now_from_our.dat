60|$|The gospel seed {{which the}} apostle sowed in those rich, luxurious, clever, learned, Romans, {{was like the}} seed which fell on thorny ground; and the cares and pleasures of this life, and the deceitfulness or riches, sprang up, and choked the word, and it {{remained}} unfruitful. But the gospel seed which was sown among our poor, wild, simple, ignorant forefathers, was the seed which fell on an honest and good heart, and took root, and brought forth fruit, some thirty, some fifty, and some one hundred fold. Epiphany came late to us--not for three hundred years after our Lord's birth: but, when it came, the light which it brought remained with us, and lights us even <b>now</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> cradle to our grave: and so again was fulfilled the Scripture, which says, that God chooses the weak things of this world to confound the strong; the foolish to confound the wise; yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought the things which are, that no flesh should glory in his presence.|$|E

60|$|I wish I {{could give}} reality to {{every part of}} that most noble, that most lovably {{beautiful}} temple. We had only a poor half-hour for it, and we could not do more than flutter {{the pages of the}} epic it was and catch here and there a word, a phrase: a word writ in architecture or sculpture, a phrase richly expressed in gold and silver and precious marble, or painted in the dyes of the dawns and sunsets which used to lend themselves so much more willingly to the arts than they seem to do <b>now.</b> <b>From</b> <b>our</b> note-books I find that this cathedral of Toledo appeared more wonderful to one of us than the cathedral of Burgos; but who knows? It might have been that the day was warmer and brighter and had not yet shivered and saddened to the cold rain it ended in. At any rate the vast church filled itself more and more with the solemn glow in which we left it steeped when we went out and took our dreamway through the narrow, winding, wandering streets that seemed to lure us where they would. One of them climbed with us to the Alcazar, which is no longer any great thing to see in itself, but which opens a hospitable space within its court for a prospect of so much of the world around Toledo, the world of yellow river and red fields and blue mountains, and white-clouded azure sky, that we might well have mistaken it for the whole earth. In itself, as I say, the Alcazar is no great thing for where it is, but if we had here in New York an Alcazar that remembered historically back through French, English, Arabic, Gothic. Roman, and Carthaginian occupations to the inarticulate Iberian past we should come, I suppose, from far and near to visit it. Now, however, after gasping at its outlook, we left it hopelessly, and lost ourselves, except for our kindly guide, in the crooked little stony lanes, with the sun hot on our backs and the shade cool in our faces. There were Moorish bits and suggestions in the white walls and the low flat roofs of the houses, but these were not so jealous of their privacy as such houses were once meant to be. Through the gate of one we were led into a garden of simple flowers belted with a world-old parapet, over which we could look at a stretch of the Gothic wall of King Wamba's time, before the miserable Roderick won and lost his kingdom. A pomegranate tree, red with fruit, overhung us, and from the borders of marigolds and zinnias and German clover the gray garden-wife gathered a nosegay for us. She said she was three duros and a half old, as who should say three dollars and a half, and she had a grim amusement in so translating her seventy years.|$|E

30|$|The {{thesis that}} a re-conceptualisation of time can offer us new {{structural}} perspectives is instructive. The {{beginning of the}} 20 th Century heralded a caesura in natural sciences, and especially in physics, that is almost entirely unreflected in future research. As stated above, we are calling this into question purely for practical reasons. Adopting a concept of time based on simultaneity and uncertainty theories (Planck, Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg et al.) as proposed in Luhmann’s evolution theory perspective on organisations, may be highly abstract in theory, but it has heavy practical repercussions. The fact that {{the consequences of this}} shift, which is now almost one hundred years old, have not yet been fathomed makes it all the more urgent that we do so <b>now.</b> <b>From</b> <b>our</b> point of view, the “catch-up modernism” that could refer here to presentism is thus not an implosion of the profession, but a momentous turning point - befitting a discipline that tends toward sudden leaps in conceptional consolidation.|$|E
40|$|Two {{hundred years}} ago in Great Britain, the {{political}} system was dominated by electoral power exercised through rotten boroughs, a system characterized by institutionalized corruption - these electoral boroughs were owned by local elites, and voting was restricted {{to a handful of}} people. Whilst industrially she was the wonder of the world, the political system in Great Britain was restricted, corruption was the norm, and it seemed impossible to imagine that such an ancient system could be changed. By the time of the Reform Act of 1832 however, Britain had already been going through a process of constitutional change lasting for hundreds of years – it is only <b>now,</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> position of 20 / 20 hindsight, that we choose to interpret all of the events since the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215 as if it were some seamless whole, an inevitable process that would lead to the position of superior moral governance that we appear to think we are in now...|$|E

40|$|We are—and {{ought to}} be—forevermore unable {{to draw up}} a {{complete}} blueprint of the fully emancipated society, in all its procedural and consequential details, as we might wish it would emerge here and <b>now</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> ongoing complex social process. However, can’t we at least reflect on the individual dispositions and the interaction mechanisms which would be conducive to the uncontrolled emergence of an emancipated society? Some of us, a minority perhaps, might believe that it need no longer emerge because it already has (Fukuyama [1992]); for the rest of us, however, the political disasters of really existing communism, as well as the philosophical and scientific advancement of ideas about “out-of-control systems” (see e. g. Kelly [1994]), have brought to the fore today’s most pressing epistemological urgency—and not surprisingly, it lacks a simple, linear formulation: we need to understand how to “harness ” the complexity (Axelrod and Cohen [2000]) of a social system whose aggregate states emerge as the partly unintended result of the adaptive interaction of individuals and groups of individuals, each of whom is attempting to act and react on a model intended to “harness ” the system’s complexity for its specific interests.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried out for the deformation and breakup of liquid drop suspended in an oil tank which is decelerated by an impact. The experiments were conducted in a specially designed drop tower, in which the oil tank can be lifted up to about 1. 5 m high and dropped onto ground damper. A high speed camera was used to visualize the temporal development and breakup. Four recognizable different modes of the drop deformation have been found up to <b>now</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> experiments. The transitions between these modes appear {{to be related to}} the density ratio of the drop to the oil, the interfacial tension, the initial drop diameter and the impulse being generated by suddenly decelerating the oil tank. The deformation appears to be more severe if the density ratio, the initial drop diameter, or the impulse is increased, and vice versa. The interfacial tension between the drop and the ambient oil seems to play a suppression role against the drop deformation and breakup. The results of the transitions between these modes were summarized by “deformation and breakup maps ” where different modes are shown in the H-D plane (H is the height of the tank falling freely and D is drop initial diameter) for different values of the density ratio and interfacial tension...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper and}} poster seek to address several {{fundamental}} questions about time. What are the natural phenomena and cognitive structures {{that underlie the}} human perception of time? What social constructs have evolved around questioning its nature? How did they arise and evolve over the ages? I have been exploring the subject of time merging my background as a conceptual artist with principles of scientific study. My {{focus has been on}} the changing visualizations of time through the evolution of human society, from the earliest depictions of the flowing river or the circular uroboros – a snake eating its own tail – to the linear arrow and the paintings of Dali and Magritte, who depict time with modern metaphors of a clock, a train, or the 4 th dimension. How have these images influenced scientific, religious and philosophical thought surrounding time? Drawn by <b>now</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> collective subconscious, do they naturally bias us towards particular conventional models? And finally, how can an analysis of the visual metaphors of time contribute to the larger dialogue, one that involves scientists, technologists and philosophers, each with their own theories on the subject? This project attempts to answer these questions, and to propose that art is an essential voice in any discussion about time. Can artists and scientists working together bring us closer to an answer to the age-old question – what is time...|$|E
