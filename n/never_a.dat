5|$|Aside {{from his}} death, remarkably {{little is known}} of Cooke's circumstances. Even his date of birth is unclear, and unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was <b>never</b> <b>a</b> notable society figure. He was however well {{respected}} in his profession and following his death {{was the subject of}} tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in St Paul's Cathedral and his local church in Wiltshire.|$|E

5|$|Haunting Ground {{has been}} a subject of game studies {{regarding}} the relationship between players and their avatars. It {{was found that the}} altering states of Fiona's subjectivity change the role of the player in the game.

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1865, Melvin was elected prosecuting {{attorney}} of Hardy County in the Potomac Highlands of West Virginia. In 1866 he relocated to Wellsburg in Brooke County where he resumed the practice of law.

5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the small {{population}} of Ch'ol Maya in southern Petén and Belize was forcibly removed to Alta Verapaz, {{where the people}} were absorbed into the Q'eqchi' population. After the conquest, the colonial administration of Petén was divided between the ecclesiastical authorities in Yucatán and secular administration {{as part of the}} Captaincy General of Guatemala. There was <b>never</b> <b>a</b> strong Spanish presence in the area, which remained remote, although the Spanish built a fortress-prison, the Castillo de Arismendi; it was finished in 1700.|$|E
5|$|The Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries, {{formed in}} 1967 by Chile, Peru, Zaire and Zambia, {{operated}} in the copper market as OPEC does in oil, though it never achieved the same influence, particularly because the second-largest producer, the United States, was <b>never</b> <b>a</b> member; it was dissolved in 1988.|$|E
5|$|The Nyasaland African Congress (NAC) was {{particularly}} vocal about increased African {{representation in the}} Nyasaland Legislative Council, demanding in September 1957 an African majority in the council. Nyasaland's inclusion in the federation was <b>never</b> <b>a</b> goal of its proponents, it was there primarily {{because it was not}} economically viable by itself. Welensky did not understand or appreciate the party's goal of increased African representation or secession when it relied on the federation for its well being.|$|E

5|$|The church records {{include an}} {{unbroken}} list of rectors {{dating back to}} 1302, {{during the reign of}} King EdwardI. One notable rector was John Dee, who served from early 1568 until the year 1574, although he was probably <b>never</b> <b>a</b> permanent resident. Dee, a noted mathematician, astrologer, alchemist and astronomer, was on friendly terms with the ruling monarch, Queen ElizabethI, and had given her astrological advice for setting the date of her coronation.|$|E
5|$|The {{country is}} one vast wilderness, blasted out of {{recognition}} where once villages & orchards & fertile land, now tossed about & churned in hopeless disorder with <b>never</b> <b>a</b> landmark {{as far as}} the eye can reach & dotted about in the scrub and untidiness of it all are to be seen here & there singly & in groups little white crosses marking the place where men have fallen and been buried.|$|E
5|$|The {{infantry}} assault lasted {{less than}} an hour.

Jerom and Bessy both were restyled but disappeared {{a few years later}} in 1988 and 1993. Pats, later renamed Tits, already disappeared in 1986.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} {{levels of}} the Quiriguá valley increased rapidly after the successful rebellion against Copán in 738, although it was <b>never</b> <b>a</b> heavily populated site. In the 9thcentury there was a severe decline in population, culminating in the abandonment of the city.|$|E

5|$|A stone pier {{was built}} in 1858 by the Somerset Central Railway. Soon afterwards, in 1860, a steamer service to Wales was inaugurated, but it was <b>never</b> <b>a</b> {{commercial}} success, and ended in 1888. Burnham-on-Sea railway station was the terminus of the Burnham branch of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. It opened in 1858, closed to scheduled passenger traffic in 1951, and stopped being used for excursions in 1962. The former Great Western Railway station {{is now known as}} Highbridge and Burnham. A second pier, built of concrete between 1911 and 1914, is claimed to be the shortest pier in Britain.|$|E
5|$|All {{the while}} Hancock was posted in New York, {{he did his}} best to keep his {{political}} ambitions alive. He received some votes at the Democrats' 1876 convention, but was <b>never</b> <b>a</b> serious contender as New York governor Samuel J. Tilden swept the field on the second ballot. The Republican candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes, won the election, and Hancock refocused his ambition on 1880. The electoral crisis of 1876 and the subsequent end to Reconstruction in 1877 convinced many observers that the election of 1880 would give the Democrats their best chance at victory in a generation.|$|E
