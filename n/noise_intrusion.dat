If, however, the noise encountered differs significantly from the system’s assumptions, performance will suffer. In this work, we propose a novel speech enhancement system based on decomposing the spectrogram into sparse activation of a dictionary of target speech templates, and a low-rank background model, which makes few assumptions about the noise other than its limited spectral variation. A variation of this model specifically designed to handle transient <b>noise</b> <b>intrusions</b> is also proposed.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigated}} how intrusive noises affect local university {{students in their}} communities. The Community Noise Survey solicited information about types of bothersome noises, how often these noises were bothersome, activities intruded upon by these noises, feelings elicited by <b>noise</b> <b>intrusions,</b> and what participants did to abate the noises. Noise pollution in South Florida has become a pervasive issue in recent times due {{to an increase in}} population that has led to an expansion of local airports, increased traffic and construction. Noise pollution is defined as unwanted noise (Berglund & Lindvall, 1995) and has been shown to have negative psychological and physiological effects on those affected most (Blomberg, 2000; Bronzaft, 1998; Staples, 1996). Recent literature has indicated that airplane noise pollution was the most intrusive by those surveyed (Staples, 1996). Noise pollution legislation was passed in the 1970 ’s but was repealed in the early 1980 ’s, and the problem has not been revisited, mostly due to lack of political and financial support (Bronzaft, 1998; Staples...|$|R
5000|$|Corvettes {{have a very}} {{characteristic}} and noticeable exhaust noise, as {{has been}} mentioned earlier in the Design section. Due to the low and shallow angle of the exhaust pipe from the turbocharger plus very limited space, conventional marine silencers are not used on Corvettes, despite attempts by the latest company. Consequently the exterior exhaust noise has a noticeable low frequency booming characteristic. This is very apparent from the rear and flybridge decks. Within the boat, however, this booming noise is much less apparent. Noise levels have been commented on {{in one of the}} earlier press reports ("Reviews in the press" [...] section below - No. 6), saying they were [...] "about average....but the diesel rumble was very apparent". They added that adding a thick carpet would make a [...] "huge difference". These comments referred only to the noise inside the cabins, not the exhaust booming noise mentioned above. Of all the many press reports and tests on Corvettes, however, no other reference singles out noise as a feature of Corvettes, suggesting that <b>noise</b> <b>intrusion</b> can be very subjective and not an issue with the majority of owners.|$|E

It had an optional 4-speed, hydraulically operated transmission that {{was said to be}} rough operating, tended to hunt between gears, and do unnecessary downshifts to second gear. Ride quality was poor, as was cabin <b>noise</b> <b>intrusion.</b> In 1999, Daewoo made revisions to the model. The rough-operating hydraulic auto was replaced by an electronically controlled automatic transmission, which stopped the hunting between gears and random downshifts. The engine was upgraded to the 2.2 l, which boosted power from [...] to , giving better performance, but increasing fuel consumption. The Leganza also gained standard 15-inch alloy wheels, anti-theft alarm, and remote central locking. The suspension was fixed and improved, but sacrificed the smooth ride from the before model and the ability to soak up the bumps. In 2001 the Leganza gained leather upholstery, woodgrain trim, and an electric driver's seat. This was called the [...] "Limited Edition".

40|$|Predictions of the {{prevalence}} of annoyance associated with aircraft noise exposure are heavily influenced by field studies conducted in urban airport neighborhoods. Flyovers heard in such relatively high ambient noise environments are composed in large part of high absolute level, broadband noise. In contrast, noise exposure created en route by aircraft powered by unducted fan engines {{is expected to be}} relatively low in level, but to contain prominent low frequency tonal energy. These tones will be readily audible in rural and other low ambient noise environments. The annoyance of <b>noise</b> <b>intrusions</b> of low absolute level {{has been shown to be}} closely related to their audibility. Thus, one way to predict the annoyance of en route noise generated by unducted fan engines is to estimate its audibility relative to that of conventionally powered aircraft in different ambient noise environments. This may be accomplished by computing the audibility of spectra produced by an aircraft powered by unducted fan engines and comparing predicted probabilities of annoyance for them with those of conventionally powered transport aircraft...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a binaural auditory model for speech recognition, which is robust {{in the presence}} of reverberation and spatially separated noise intrusions. The principle underlying the model is to identify time-frequency regions which constitute reliable evidence of the speech signal. This is achieved both by determining the spatial location of the speech source, and by applying a simple model of reflection masking. Reliable timefrequency regions are passed to a missing data speech recognizer. We show, firstly, that the auditory model improves recognition performance in various reverberation conditions when no <b>noise</b> <b>intrusion</b> is present. Secondly, we demonstrate that the model improves performance when the speech signal is contaminated by noise, both for an anechoic environment and {{in the presence of}} simulated room reverberation. 1...|$|E

Increased coastal pressures demand better governance and this study adopted a dimensional analysis to produce a local management framework for harbour porpoise populations. Having established basic behavioural dynamics and identified critical habitats, a coastal zone use model was developed. This highlighted porpoise and coastal user interaction from a species perspective. Evidence was determined from observations and published research, and an Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) was undertaken. An estimation of consequence probability was determined and revealed that continued coastal use, without mitigation, {{is likely to have}} significant local impacts on porpoise populations. A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis and legislative appraisal highlighted potential opportunities and deficiencies. Mitigation refers principally to industry, fisheries and recreation and suggestions include flexible zoning; speed and vessel restrictions; engineering solutions to <b>noise</b> <b>intrusion</b> and fisheries monitoring.

40|$|In urban environments {{road traffic}} volumes are {{increasing}} and {{the density of}} living is becoming higher. As a consequence the urban community is being exposed to increasing levels of road traffic noise. It is also evident that the noise reduction potential of within-the-road-reserve treatments such as noise barriers, mounding and pavement surfacing has been exhausted. This paper presents a strategy that involves the comparison of noise ameliorative treatments {{both within and outside}} the road reserve. The noise reduction resulting from the within-the-road-reserve component of treatments has been evaluated using a leading application of the CoRTN Model, developed by the UK Department of Transport 1988 [1], and the outside road reserve treatment has been evaluated in accordance with the Australian Standard 3671, Acoustics - Road traffic <b>noise</b> <b>intrusion</b> - Building sitting and construction [5].

40|$|Guest {{rooms in}} a {{historic}} landmark luxury hotel suffered excessive environmental mechanical equipment <b>noise</b> <b>intrusion</b> through windows. Measurements of outdoor-indoor sound transmission loss {{have been carried out}} to compare the performance of four retrofit sound control window fixtures with performance of existing fixtures. The hotel originally opened in 1924 and reopened in 2000, after a multi-million dollar renovation in which original window fixtures were replaced. Several guest rooms overlook the roof of the hotel's adjacent banquet and meetings wing, with rooftop mechanical equipment that includes air-cooled chillers, air handlers, exhaust fans, and cooling tower. Hotel management desired to reduce mechanical noise in guest rooms, and some window fixtures were again replaced or augmented with various retrofit sound control glazing fixtures. Sound transmission loss measurements using outdoor amplified broadband noise source and, separately, mechanical equipment noise sources were conducted on one existing, single-pane guest room window type and four multi-pane sound control glazing fixtures to compare effectiveness. Analysed window types included single-pane, double-pane, and triple-pane systems, and glazing types included laminated glass and plate glass. No specific noise reduction criterion was used, but analyses were conducted to determine which glazing fixture's noise reduction spectrum best matched the tonal noise spectra of the existing mechanical equipment. Noise reduction spectra were also analysed with respect to ASTM (OITC and STC) and ISO (Rw) curve fitting techniques. Noise reduction with amplified broadband noise source was compared to noise reduction with mechanical equipment noise and vibration sources to evaluate possible contributions from equipment vibration. This paper presents photographs and details of the existing and retrofit window conditions with tabular and graphical results from measurement of outdoor-indoor sound transmission through windows and existing interior ambient conditions. 1...|$|E

30|$|The key {{technology}} and main difficulty for optical fiber intrusion pre-warning systems (OFIPS) is {{the extraction of}} harmful-intrusion signals. After being processed by a phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometer (Φ-OTDR), vibration signals can be preliminarily extracted. Generally, these include <b>noises</b> and <b>intrusions.</b> Here, intrusions {{can be divided into}} harmful and harmless intrusions. With respect to the close study of signal characteristics, an effective extraction method of harmful intrusion is proposed in the paper. Firstly, in the part of the background reconstruction, all intrusion signals are first detected by a constant false alarm rate (CFAR). We then reconstruct the backgrounds by extracting two-part information of alarm points, time and amplitude. This ensures that the detection background consists of intrusion signals. Secondly, in the part of the two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, in order to extract harmful ones from all extracted intrusions, we design a separation method. It is based on the signal characteristics of harmful intrusion, which are shorter time interval and higher amplitude. In the actual OFIPS, the detection method is used in some typical scenes, which includes a lot of harmless intrusions, for example construction sites and busy roads. Results show that we can effectively extract harmful intrusions.|$|R
