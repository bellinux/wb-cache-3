Typical discharge parameters during our investigation are pressures between 80 and 200 Pa and current densities up to 7 mA cm- 2. The radial light intensity profiles of some selected copper and argon lines were measured. An {{analysis of these}} profiles gives insigths into the excitation rates of the argon filling gas and the sputtered metal atoms as well as into the radial dimension of the negative glow. The different excitation mechanisms lead to a sharp change of the radial light intensity profiles emitted by many copper spectral lines, which indicates the transition region between the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> and the negative glow.

By laserinduced fluorescence, the particle densities of barium atoms and ions were measured timeresolved at different distances from the spot center. In addition, the time-dependent <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> voltage was measured using an improved band method. The model combines a kinetic part for the electrons with a fluid part for the barium atoms and ions. Both parts are spatially resolved in spherically symmetric geometry. The space-dependent electron Boltzmann equation yields the electron density and the ionization rate coefficient of barium as functions of the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> voltage. These results are used to solve the time-dependent particle balance equations of barium atoms and ions which include the ionization of barium as gain and loss terms, respectively. Good agreement between the measured and calculated particle densities of barium atoms is obtained.

40|$|In this contribution, a photoconductively {{switched}} high-voltage {{spark gap}} {{with an emphasis}} on theswitching behavior is modeled. It is known experimentally that not all of the voltage that is present at the input of the spark gap is switched, but rather a fraction of it drops across the spark gap. This voltage drop depends on the voltage that is present at the input of the spark gap with higher voltages resulting in a smaller drop. We have investigated two possible causes of this: the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> and the resistance of the plasma arc. Using an analytical model of the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall,</b> we have established that the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> can be excluded as the cause of the observed voltage drop. A one-dimensional, time-dependent non-local thermal equilibrium fluid model of the arc plasma has been made.

These relatively new atmospheric plasmas are nonequilibrium plasmas with gas temperature around 100 °C and electron temperature in the 1 – 10 eV range. Their appearance is characteristically diffuse and uniform, and their temporal features are repetitive and stable. Of the reported numerical studies of atmospheric glow discharges, most are based on the hydrodynamic approximation in which electrons are assumed to be in equilibrium with the local electric field.

40|$|Surface discharges, as {{a special}} kind of barrier discharges, occur in {{arrangements}} with small but extended high-voltage electrodes on one side of a dielectric layer and a plane counter electrode on its reverse side. Surface discharges are used e. g. in excimer lamps, in plasmadisplays, for surface treatment of plastic foils and for plasma-chemical applications like ozone production. This work has the aim to model the dynamics of surface discharges and to simulate the spatial and temporal resolved discharge development in oxygen and air at atmospheric pressure. The discharge development is investigated at negative and positive polarity of the surface electrode as well as at AC voltage. Based on the results of the discharge simulation the ozone generation in surface discharge arrangements is analysed. The simulation results reveal a stepwise development of the discharge on the dielectric surface at both polarities in good agreement with experimental findings. In each discharge step, the accumulation of charge carriers on the dielectric surface leads to a reduction of the field strength and the decay of the discharge step. At increased voltage a further step can develop. The discharge development at negative polarity is dominated by a <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> mechanism at the metallic surface electrode. In the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> a maximum reduced field strength of about 2400 Td is found. The propagation of the discharge along the dielectric surface is combined with a field strength maximum of about 260 Td {{at the tip of the}} discharge. At positive polarity a positive streamer propagates along the dielectric surface in each discharge step. At the streamer head, a maximum reduced field strength of about 700 Td is found. In the streamer channel the field strength drops to about 10 Td. A <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> is found as well, which appears near the streamer head on the dielectric surface and has comparable properties as that with negative polarity. The results of a spatial resolved simulation of the plasma-chemical processes in air show, that especially in areas with high field strengths nitrogen is dissociated as well as oxygen. At negative polarity this happens in the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall,</b> at positive polarity at the streamer head. Because of local over-temperatures of up to 80 K found at both polarities nearby the surface electrodes, nitrogen oxides are produced, which destroy effectively ozone in catalytic reaction chains.

The model describes the principle relations between the voltage, current, plasma density, and the axial structure of the discharge. Contrary to standard DC discharges, this discharge does not require electron multiplication in the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> to produce ions, but rather to satisfy the electron energy balance. A self-sustainment condition is obtained from the energy balance per electron-ion pair. From this, it follows {{that there is a}} maximum voltage at which the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> thickness tends to zero and the current density tends asymptotically to infinity. The discharge develops axial non-uniformity and an axial electric field in order to evacuate the created electrons to the anode, such that the characteristic time for transport losses is the same for electrons as for ions. The axial profiles of the current density, plasma density, and potential are obtained from the electron continuity equation. It is shown that additional energy absorption from the axial field, similar to electron heating in DC positive columns, modifies the self-sustainment condition and thus leads to a shift in the voltage-current characteristic, depending on the cathode length...|$|R

40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis {{presents}} a new approach {{to the understanding of the}} collision processes which occur in the vicinity of the cathode of the "cold cathode" arc of which Hg and Cu are taken as examples. The temperature at the cathode spots of such arcs is too low for electrons to be emitted thermionically. None of the theories hitherto suggested, such as the field emission and thermal ionisation theories, can account satisfactorily for the well-established features of the arc: the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> in potential which is often lower than the ionisation potential of the cathode vapour; the concentration of current at the cathode into a small spot where the current density is very large; the short re-ignition tins; the force on the cathode; the evaporation of the cathode substance; the light emitted from the spot; the temperature of the cathode under the spot and the heat losses from the arc, and also the transition to the arc from the glow discharge. Because of the abundance of experimental information which exists, particularly about the mercury arc, this study is essentially a theoretical one. The starting point in the study is to consider the density distribution in the space above the cathode of the metal vapour originating from the spot. Whereas it was previously thought that atoms evaporating from the spot would cross the evacuated vessel without collisions before condensing on the walls, it is suggested here for the first time that the evaporation is controlled by back-scattering of atoms and hence is a diffusion problem. In setting up the equation of diffusion for the steady state, allowance is made for the variation of the diffusion coefficient with the density of the vapour. The solution shows that a large density, corresponding perhaps to 10 atmospheres or more can exist close to the evaporating surface although the density elsewhere in the vessel is very low. Both the magnitude of the force on the cathode and of the net evaporation from the spot are consistent with this picture. The excitation and ionisation processes in the cathode region are consequently regarded as taking place In a dense vapour. On account of the low <b>cathode</b> <b>fall,</b> collisions between electrons and neutral atoms can only lead to excitation: ionisation can therefore occur only by step-wise processes. Electrons from the cathode gain sufficient energy in the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> to excite neutral atoms within a few mean free paths. Elastic losses are shown to be negligible. A large density of excited atoms is produced close to the cathode and these diffuse back to the cathode surface. Since the transit times of the excited atoms are shorter than their free life, they reach the cathode without losing their energy by radiation and there release electrons. This leads to a self-sustaining arc discharge. From a simultaneous consideration of energy balance and number balance, the yield for the emission of electrons by excited atoms is es- timated. It compares favourably with existing experimental and theoretical evidence. Since the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> of a mercury arc is larger than the resonance potential, electrons which have lost energy in an exciting collision can gain further energy in the remainder of the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall.</b> It is shown that because of strong interaction between the electrons an energy distribution is established, so that each electron from the cathode produces, on the average, more than one excited atom in the vapour. Since the density of excited atoms is high, collisions between them are shown to produce electrons and molecular positive ions. The reverse process, that is recombination of ions and electrons to form ex- cited atoms approximately balances the former process. A small difference is sufficient to account for the current of positive ions to the cathode. This current is associated with a positive space charge which predominates close to the cathode, and the ensuing electric field causes the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> in potential. From the known values of current density and <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> and the calculated density distribution of neutral vapour it has been possible to derive how the concentration of electrons, positive ions and excited atoms, and also the axial electric field vary as a function of the distance from the cathode. The transition of the glow discharge into the arc is discussed. It is shown that the final size of the cathode spot can be found from sta- bility considerations associated with the flow of excited atoms to the cathode. The short reignition time is explained in terms of the rapid neutralisation of the positive space charge near the cathode and the subsequent inability of the space-charge region to form when the external potential is re-applied. The light from the cathode region is attributed to the radiation from excited atoms which have diffused up into regions of lower vapour density. The observed spectrum of the spot is re-interpreted on the basis of the new picture. The above treatment can be applied to arcs other than the mercury arc with certain minor modifications. The copper arc is taken as an example. The second part of the thesis presents a new theory of the motion of a cathode spot in a transverse magnetic field. It is known that under certain conditions the spot will move in a direction contrary to Ampere's rule. This reverse motion usually occurs when the ambient gas or vapour pressure is low. If the pressure is increased, the direction of notion changes to the correct, or Ampere direction. The pressure at which the change of direction occurs is the greater the stronger the magnetic field and the lower the current. The effect is found only in cold-cathode arcs. From these observations it is proposed that the apparent violation of Anpere's rule is due to a local reversal of the magnetic field in the cathode region. The magnetic field acting at the cathode spot it thought to consist of two components. The first is the externally applied field, and the second is an opposing field due to the current loop in the deflected positive column. It is shown that the magnitude of the latter may exceed the applied field and thus the spot will be driven in the reverse direction. The behaviour of the arc at low pressure and with argon admitted is explained qualitatively. It is shown here that the reverse driving effect is not confined to low-pressure arcs, but occurs in open air between closely spaced copper electrodes. The separation of the electrodes is shown to be an important parameter of the effect, which supports the view that it is due to a distortion of the arc column rather than to some process occurring in the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> region. </p...|$|R

This paper gives a physical interpretation of the axially symmetric arc spot by a simulation of its properties with a cathodic sheath model which takes into account a reduction in the work function above a critical temperature of the cathode surface by a thorium ion current. At first the optical observation and spectroscopic investigations are recapitulated. Then, an overview is given on the essential elements which are needed to simulate the cathodic arc attachment on a hot electrode. A simulation of a central cathode spot with these elements gives results which are far away from the experimental findings if a constant work function φ is used. Therefore, a temperature-dependent work function φ(T) is introduced. This φ(T) transitions from 4. 55 to 3 eV above temperatures of the order of 3000 K.

Furthermore, it is necessary to understand the relationship between the electrode material and the CFV. Considering the above, we measured the CCL's CFV with an indirect CFV measurement method using a hot cathode fluorescent lamp. By observing the negative glow of the electrode, we investigated the relationship between the CFV and the negative glow condition. The results showed that there is a relationship between the CCL's CFV and the γ coefficient of the electrode. Moreover, they make it clear that there is a relation between the CFV and the negative glow condition of each electrode material. We conclude that the CFV measurement method is useful for estimating the performance of a CCL's electrode...|$|R
40|$|Water {{management}} in cathode catalyst layer (CCL) {{plays an important}} role in the PEM fuel cell operation. A novel anti-flooding CCL is developed with the addition of oxygen permeable and hydrophobic dimethyl silicone oil (DSO) into the catalyst layer (CL) to improve the water balance and oxygen transport within the cathode. With the addition of 0. 5 mg cm- 2 DSO in the CCL, the ability of water management has been enhanced greatly compared to that with a <b>normal</b> <b>cathode.</b> Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has been employed to characterize the electrochemical behavior of the single fuel cell. The results show that the increased hydrophobicity of the CCL by DSO modification effectively expels water out of the voids of CCL. In addition, DSO in the CCL enhances oxygen accessibility to the CCL, thus improving the performance of the PEM fuel cell significantly. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Keine Zusammenfassung in englischer Sprache hinterlegt.) A new highly-sensitive {{method for}} the {{detection}} of the local electric field strength in hydrogen discharges is presented in this Thesis. This method is ideally suited for systems with low electric field strength. Using the intermodulated optogalvanic spectroscopy, Doppler-free spectra of the first Balmer line of Hydrogen were taken in the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> of a low pressure glow discharge. Once the theoretical splitting is known, the electric field strength can be determined from the position of the Doppler-free Stark components of the hydrogen Balmer alpha line. To obtain the electric field strength these profiles were fitted to the Doppler-free optogalvanic spectra. It has been shown {{for the first time that}} by using the Doppler-free intermodulated optogalvanic spectroscopy isolated Stark components may be measured. This novel technique is a key development for the investigation of low electric field strengths in low pressure glow discharges...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{a situation}} which {{is common for}} magnetized technical plasmas such as dc magnetron discharges and HiPIMS systems, where secondary electrons enter the plasma after being accelerated in the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> and encounter a nearly uniform bulk. An analytic calculation of the distribution function of hot electrons is presented; these are described as an initially monoenergetic beam that slows down by Coulomb collisions with a Maxwellian distribution of bulk (cold) electrons, and by inelastic collisions with neutrals. Although this analytical solution {{is based on a}} steady-state assumption, a comparison of the characteristic time-scales suggests that it may be applicable to a variety of practical time-dependent discharges, and it may be used to introduce kinetic effects into models based on the hypothesis of Maxwellian electrons. The results are verified for parameters appropriate to HiPIMS discharges, by means of time-dependent and fully-kinetic numerical calculations...|$|R
