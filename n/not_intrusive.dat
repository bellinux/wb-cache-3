5|$|Because And Yet It Moves was {{originally}} designed to be played with digital controls, the Wii Remote's analog motion controls needed to be implemented such that they felt natural and <b>not</b> <b>intrusive.</b> Broken Rules determined, following a number of tests, that allowing the player to freely rotate to any degree best suited motion controls; originally the player could only rotate in 90 degree intervals. Four different control schemes were implemented to satisfy a wide number of players, three of which either use motion control or the Wii Remote pointer. While the file size limit imposed on WiiWare games was not an issue, the visuals needed to be downsampled to cohere with the Wii hardware. A standard-definition television was used in development; Bohatsch felt the visuals looked nicer on the SDTV than on a PC or Mac with higher display resolution, but warned that some HDTVs might not upsample the Wii resolution properly, recommending that a component cable be used while playing the game. The online leaderboards were omitted from the Wii version because the PC version's leaderboards were not frequently used. Three new levels, unlocked when the player completes the main campaign mode, were added. The near {{final version of the}} game was submitted to Nintendo's Quality Assurance team in May 2010 to inspect and find bugs. And Yet It Moves was released on the Wii Shop Channel in North America on August 23, 2010 and then in Europe on August 27.|$|E

40|$|Given that {{unwanted}} {{thoughts are}} enhanced when suppressed, we tested among college freshmen who {{were about to}} take an academic exam if an acceptance strategy consisting of <b>not</b> suppressing <b>intrusive</b> thoughts will improve test performance. This strategy proved superior to students’ own default strategies {{as much as a}} modified, alternative strategy, avoiding the antecedents of intrusive thoughts. Moreover, the combination of the two strategies counteracted a stronger, negative effect of test anxiety on test performance as compared with each strategy used alone. The results suggest that <b>not</b> only <b>intrusive</b> thoughts per se but also the suppression of these thoughts can disrupt test performance, and hint that approaching such thoughts with acceptance may not interfere with simultaneously working toward avoiding the antecedents of these thoughts...|$|R

5000|$|Prior to Payner, {{there had}} been {{arguments}} that the supervisory power should be thought of only as the judicial branch's self-policing ability. But, Carome argued, {{from the time the}} Court first invoked it in McNabb, [...] "it has been used to counteract improprieties of the executive branch that do not amount to constitutional violations." [...] Courts have also recognized that Congress can limit its application, and have used it sparingly, limiting the power's potential to upset the balance of powers. It also was <b>not</b> <b>intrusive,</b> checking the actions of the executive branch only insofar as it reached criminal prosecutions. Thus the exercise of the supervisory power is a refusal of the courts to participate in the illegalities of the executive branch in an effort to preserve their own integrity.

My duty to be tolerant towards the other effectively means that I should not get too close to him or her, not intrude into his space—in short, that I should respect his intolerance towards my over-proximity. This is increasingly emerging as the central human right of advanced capitalist society: the right not to be harassed, that is, to be kept at a safe distance from others."
