25|$|In {{a report}} by {{scientists}} commissioned by the ICC it was shown that Pakistani bowler Shoaib Akhtar and Indian bowler R. P.

In the report it was seen that R. P.

These actions are not considered to be chucking as they are due to the distinctive architecture of their elbows, possibly a congenital condition. Since these cricketers have no control over this hyperextension, any degree of hyperextension (past zero) is not included in the 15 degree extension tolerance threshold.|$|E

The lack of knowledge about the stagnant region in the cutting with negative rake requires researching new models.

2500|$|On 23 February 2008, B-2 [...] "AV-12" [...] Spirit of Kansas {{crashed on}} the runway shortly after takeoff from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. Spirit of Kansas had been {{operated}} by the 393rd Bomb Squadron, 509th Bomb Wing, Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, and had logged 5,176 flight hours. The two person crew ejected safely from the aircraft and survived the crash. The aircraft was completely destroyed, a hull loss valued at US$1.4billion. After the accident, the Air Force took the B-2 fleet off operational status until clearing the fleet for flight status 53 days later on 15 April 2008. The cause of the crash was later determined to be moisture in the aircraft's Port Transducer Units during air data calibration, which distorted the information {{being sent to the}} bomber's air data system. As a result, the flight control computers calculated an inaccurate airspeed, and a <b>negative</b> <b>angle</b> of attack, causing the aircraft to pitch upward 30 degrees during takeoff.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{demoulding}} of the tire from segmented mould. The optimal number of segments {{will depend on}} a concrete tire tread. In case of small number of segments, the <b>negative</b> <b>angles</b> generate high stress on the material which can cause a damage of the final product, mainly due to lower strength when the rubber is hot. With <b>negative</b> <b>angles</b> rise also the difficulty to shift the segments into radial direction and increase wear of the moving plates due to the friction resistance. On the other hand {{a large number of}} segments provides construction and economic problems. That is why, it is necessary to perform calculation of stress acting on the tire tread surface during mould opening and optimize the number of segments {{in such a way that}} the solution will be economical. The obtained results showed that in this case study, without consideration the wear resistance, all the proposed solutions may be used. If we do not consider the economical part, the optimal segment angle is 23 ° and the number of segments is 11...|$|R
