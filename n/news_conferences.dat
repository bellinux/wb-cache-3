5|$|Stossel grew {{continuously}} more {{frustrated with}} having {{to follow the}} assignment editor's vision of what was news. Perhaps because of his stuttering, he had always avoided covering what others covered, feeling he could not succeed if {{he was forced to}} compete with other reporters by shouting out questions at <b>news</b> <b>conferences.</b> However, this led to the unexpected realization for Stossel that more important events were those that occurred slowly, such as the women's movement, the growth of computer technology, and advancements in contraception, rather than daily events like government pronouncements, elections, fires or crime. One day, Stossel bypassed the assignment editor to give Ed Joyce a list of story ideas the assignment editor had rejected. Joyce agreed that Stossel's ideas were better, and approved them.|$|E

25|$|Powers {{enjoyed the}} limelight, and {{was accused of}} {{scheduling}} <b>news</b> <b>conferences</b> so he could appear live on national television and occasionally twisting the facts. For example, he told reporters the day before Gus Grissom's flight that the astronaut had gone fishing that day and had cooked and eaten his catch, which would have violated his pre-flight diet.|$|E

25|$|Additionally during 2008 {{and early}} 2009 a debate emerged within NASA over the {{presence}} of 'blobs' which appeared on photos of the vehicle's landing struts, which have been variously described as being either water droplets or 'clumps of frost'.

500|$|On April 9, 2012, {{construction}} workers began demolishing legally protected historic structures, even though earlier that year, their safety was guaranteed at several <b>news</b> <b>conferences</b> and the buildings themselves {{were included in}} scale models of the [...] "renovated" [...] descent. The destruction of the buildings took place {{under the guise of}} [...] "reconstruction" [...] efforts, which began in October 2011. Preliminary reports indicate that the buildings directly across from, and next to the Museum of Bulgakov, (Buildings 10a, 10b, and 9/11) were all razed to the ground. The land was being redeveloped to make room for a new office and business complex to house Rinat Akhmetov's Kyiv operations.|$|E
500|$|Lunney {{attracted}} significant {{media attention}} in 1968, {{when he worked}} as lead flight director on Apollo 7, {{the first of the}} manned Apollo flights. Coming as it did after the Apollo 1 fire, the mission was an important test for the Apollo program, and was stressful for astronauts and controllers alike. Lunney had primary responsibility for dealing with the mission commander, Wally Schirra, who repeatedly questioned orders from the ground. Although pressed by reporters in <b>news</b> <b>conferences,</b> Lunney stayed diplomatic and said nothing critical of Schirra. Privately, however, he was extremely exasperated, and later assured his team of young controllers that [...] "manned spaceflight is usually better than this". He was also diplomatic about Donn Eisele's sarcastic comment to the CAPCOM that he would [...] "like to meet the man, or whomever it was, that dreamed up that little gem". The [...] "gem" [...] turned out to be Lunney's.|$|E
500|$|Brosnan {{first became}} aware of nuclear {{disarmament}} {{at the age of}} nine when worldwide condemnation of the 1962 U.S. nuclear tests in Nevada headlined international news. During the 1990s, he participated in <b>news</b> <b>conferences</b> in Washington, D.C. to help Greenpeace draw attention to the issue. [...] Brosnan boycotted the French GoldenEye premiere to support Greenpeace's protest against the French nuclear testing program. From 1997 to 2000, Brosnan and wife Smith worked with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) to stop a proposed salt factory from being built at Laguna San Ignacio. The couple with Halle Berry, Cindy Crawford and Daryl Hannah successfully fought the Cabrillo Port Liquefied Natural Gas facility that was proposed off the coast of Malibu; the State Lands Commission eventually denied the lease to build the terminal. In May 2007, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed the facility. Brosnan is also listed {{as a member of the}} Sea Shepherd Conservation Society's Board of Advisors. Brosnan was named 'Best-dressed Environmentalist' by the Sustainable Style Foundation in 2004.|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, Thomas sat in {{the front}} row and asked the first {{question}} during White House press conferences. However, according to Thomas in a 2006 Daily Show interview, this ended because she no longer represented a wire service. During the Bush administration, Thomas was moved to the back row during press conferences; She was called upon at briefings on a daily basis but no longer ended Presidential <b>news</b> <b>conferences</b> saying, [...] "Thank you, Mr. President."

Shelby's attorney had previously stated that she thought Crutcher might be {{under the influence of}} PCP based on what she learned during her drug-recognition training. Crutcher's father had stated in a 2012 affidavit that his son had a history of PCP use. The police department paid $216,000 in overtime costs for 10 days after the death for services related to increased demonstrations, staffing of patrols, [...] marches, Crutcher’s funeral and <b>news</b> <b>conferences</b> by the district attorney and Crutcher family during which the Incident Management Team also had a command post operating.|$|E

Harper spokesman Kory Teneycke later stated {{that he had not}} seen the incident, but the local candidates {{did not need to be}} interviewed, that [...] "Local candidates' priority is {{campaigning in}} their local ridings, and not talking to the national media", and that it should be enough that they hold daily <b>news</b> <b>conferences</b> with the party's most prominent members.|$|E

2500|$|Four {{prominent}} Afghan politicians, including Ghani and Abdullah, were {{in attendance}} at U.S. President Obama's inauguration in January. Karzai, however, was not. Media reports began appearing {{that suggested that}} the U.S. was eager for a change at the top in Afghanistan. Hamid Karzai was also angered when the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan, Karl W. Eikenberry, appeared beside Ghani and Abdullah at <b>news</b> <b>conferences</b> in June, ahead of the election, though Eikenberry stressed impartiality in his remarks. After Karzai {{did not show up}} at the first televised debate – against Abdullah and Ghani – the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan published an op-ed in The Washington Post calling for [...] "serious debate among the candidates" [...] in Afghanistan.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1990s the Franklin Avenue Shuttle {{was known}} as the [...] "ghost train". It was shrunk in size to only two cars, and the Dean Street station, which had 50 paying riders per day, was closed in 1995. The entire line was under {{consideration}} for abandonment, and community leaders were opposed to the move. They showed up to town hall meetings, <b>news</b> <b>conferences</b> and they sat down with transit officials. They also formed the Committee to Save the Franklin Avenue Shuttle. The coalition included the Straphangers Campaign, a local church, local community boards and the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance. They argued that subway station repair work occurred elsewhere, when no attention was paid to the Franklin Avenue Shuttle.|$|E
2500|$|House {{minority}} {{leaders also}} hold joint <b>news</b> <b>conferences</b> and consult with {{their counterparts in}} the Senate—and with the president if their party controls the White House. The overall objectives are to develop a coordinated communications strategy, to share ideas and information, and to present a united front on issues. Minority leaders also make floor speeches and close debate on major issues before the House; they deliver addresses in diverse forums across the country, and they write books or articles that highlight minority party goals and achievements. They must also be prepared [...] "to debate on the floor, ad lib, no notes, on a moment's notice," [...] remarked Minority Leader Michel. In brief, minority leaders are key strategists in developing and promoting the party's agenda and in outlining ways to neutralize the opposition's arguments and proposals.|$|E
