40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to examine the impact of oil prices on Vietnam's <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> using vector autoregressive (VAR) {{modeling}} and cointegration techniques. We use monthly data for the period 1995 - 2009 and include inflation and the real effective exchange rate as additional determinants of <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> We find evidence of a long-run relationship between oil prices, inflation, exchange rate, and <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> The results suggest that both oil prices and the real effective exchange rates have strongly significant impact on <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> An increase in oil price or depreciation may enhance <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> Vietnamese <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> is influenced more by changes of value of Vietnamese currency than the fluctuations of oil prices.

40|$|The {{notion that}} {{financial}} asset returns are predictors of future <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> is widespread, but detailed analyses provide little support for financial markets ability to reveal future <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> Even though {{the evidence on}} various indicators used by different researchers is mixed, {{the authors of this}} article explore the notion that financial markets reveal useful information about future <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> This article examines and answers two questions: First, what is a good way of extracting information about future <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> from asset prices? Second, do financial asset returns help predict <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> over horizons from one month to five years? To determine whether news of an assets excess return can reveal information about unexpected <b>economic</b> <b>activity,</b> the authors construct a method of extracting the news about future <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> from returns on financial assets.
