Specifically, we explore the Universal Schema (Riedel et al., 2013) and propose a method to induce interpretability.

In this work, we study this problem and propose a method for inducing interpretability <b>in</b> <b>KG</b> embeddings using entity co-occurrence statistics.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of level of yield, causes putting out dairy cows from the breed and age at first calving on fertility and longevity of dairy cows of Holstein cattle in the agribusiness Agropodnik Košetice, a. s. Monitored indicators of dairy cows of Holstein cattle were the amount of milk in the first lactation <b>in</b> <b>kg,</b> functional longevity <b>in</b> <b>kg</b> of milk, functional longevity in days and the causes of elimination of dairy cows from the breed. From the results of monitored herd {{it can be concluded}} that prolongation of age at first calving will increase functional longevity in days statistically significantly. In contrast, there was not found statistically significant effect of age at first calving on functional longevity <b>in</b> <b>kg</b> of milk. Ascertained results of the monitored dairy herd did not confirm that increasing milk yields deteriorated reproductive indicators. The length of the service period was shortened statistically significantly with increasing the yield of milk <b>in</b> <b>kg</b> per one hundred days ((P 0, 05), with the yield for the first entire lactation (P 0, 001) and the order of lactation (P 0, 001). In the monitored herd the dairy cows that were eliminated due to postpartum paresis (2570. 70 days) reached the highest longevity and also reached the highest milk production for functional longevity <b>in</b> <b>kg</b> of milk (49, 919. 95 kg) ...|$|R
