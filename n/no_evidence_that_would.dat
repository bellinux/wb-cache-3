2500|$|Democrat Philip Berg's lawsuit {{allegations}} that Obama {{had lost his}} U.S. citizenship while living in Indonesia were criticized by WND in August 2008 as not supported by U.S. citizenship law. At that time, WND also reported being told by forgery experts that [...] "many of the forgery claims made against the image were inconclusive or falsified, leaving them <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{cast doubt on the}} image's authenticity." [...] However, by December 20, WND publisher Joseph Farah said the authenticity of the birth certificate image was under serious question. Following criticism from the media, Farah defended his apparent reversal saying WNDs August 2008 report had been based on the best information available at the time, and the real issue was not the [...] "veracity of the image", rather it was that information was missing such as the location of the birth {{and the name of the}} delivery physician.|$|E
5000|$|The {{allegations}} that witnesses were threatened to prevent disclosure to this or other investigations were unsubstantiated.

5000|$|In the {{estimation}} of one historian, for all its advocacy of political militance by {{the staff of the}} New York Workers School, the actual outcome was mild: [...] Anticommunist ideologues entertained lurid fantasies of party cadres stepping right out from a classroom discussion of one of Lenin's pamphlets and violently assaulting the U.S. Government. But, despite the rhetoric of direct action, and student-staff willingness to apply communist doctrines on the streets, on picket lines, or in union struggles, there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> suggest that the Workers School, or any other party educational enterprise, was some U.S. equivalent of the Smolny Institute, the academy from which the Russian Bolsheviks made their successful armed seizure of state power in 1917." ...|$|E

Russian President Vladimir Putin indicated that he would support a US-led war if things did not change and Iraq continued to show a reluctance to completely cooperate with inspection teams. However, Putin continued to stress that the US must not go alone in any such military endeavor, but instead must work through the UN Security Council. He also stressed the need for giving the UN inspectors more time. Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov also garnered unusual applause inside the chamber with his speech against the war.|$|E
5000|$|The {{methods of}} parapsychologists are {{regarded}} by critics, {{including those who}} wrote the science standards for the California State Board of Education, to be pseudoscientific. Some of the more specific criticisms state that parapsychology {{does not have a}} clearly defined subject matter, an easily repeatable experiment that can demonstrate a psi effect on demand, nor an underlying theory to explain the paranormal transfer of information. James Alcock has stated that few of parapsychology's experimental results have prompted interdisciplinary research with more mainstream sciences such as physics or biology, and that parapsychology remains an isolated science {{to such an extent that}} its very legitimacy is questionable, and as a whole is not justified in being labeled [...] "scientific".Alcock has written [...] "Parapsychology is indistinguishable from pseudo-science, and its ideas are essentially those of magic... There is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> lead the cautious observer to believe that parapsychologists and paraphysicists are on the track of a real phenomenon, a real energy or power that has so far escaped the attention of those people engaged in [...] "normal" [...] science." ...|$|E
5000|$|Although Margaret’s {{feelings}} for Forteguerri are less clear, as {{none of the}} letters between the two women have survived, her {{lack of interest in}}—and even aversion to—her husbands makes it seem plausible that Margaret could have reciprocated Forteguerri’s feelings. Margaret had no children from her marriage to Alessandro de' Medici and dressed in black for her subsequent marriage to Ottavio Farnese, the Duke of Parma (ostensibly in honor of her recently deceased husband), and she famously refused to consummate the union for five years. [...] After she finally gave birth to twins in 1545, she chose to live separately from her husband, and when modern historian Renato Lefevre sought to defend Margaret’s honor against rumors of sexual impropriety, he stated, perhaps somewhat tellingly, that “not one of the scandalous rumors so frequent at that time touched her. If anything, one could say the contrary about her… that men were of no interest to her as such.” [...] Although there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> suggest that Margaret and Forteguerri ever consummated their relationship, their transgressions of their gender roles and prominent positions within a male-dominated society, their lack of interest in their husbands, and their tender relationship has led many to assume that these women were lovers in all but name.|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} study we {{undertook}} a series of experiments {{to test the hypothesis}} that a monogenic cause of disease may be detectable within a cohort of Finnish young onset Parkinson's disease patients. In the first instance we performed standard genome wide association analyses, and subsequent risk profile analysis. In addition we performed a series of analyses that involved testing measures of global relatedness within the cases compared to controls, searching for excess homozygosity in the cases, and examining the cases for signs of excess local genomic relatedness using a sliding window approach. This work suggested that the previously identified common, low risk alleles, and the risk models associated with these alleles, were generalizable to the Finnish Parkinson's disease population. However, we found <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> suggest a single common high penetrance mutation exists in this cohort of young onset patients...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} 15 years, the Latino {{population}} has expanded {{at a rapid}} pace in the United States. This national trend has been mirrored in Indiana. As a result, school districts within the state have developed structures and supports for {{the growing number of}} Latino students arriving in their schools. This study highlights some programs developed by Indiana school districts to help meet the needs of this quickly increasing minority. ^ This study was completed as a qualitative look at what schools are doing in Indiana to support Latino students. Interviews were conducted with the superintendents and/or the head of ELL programming in 10 different school districts in Indiana. Districts that participated varied in sizes and locations. In each interview, the same scripted set of questions was utilized. The responses were recorded and answers were reviewed for consistency and differences among the districts. While there were some expected differences in programming, overall the districts seemed to follow similar paths in providing support for Latino students. ^ Findings {{of this study indicate that}} most districts in Indiana with a growing Latino population have developed some programming to meet the needs of these students. The most common support in place was the utilization of bilingual support staff to aid students. Other applications put into place include: (1) A class that focuses solely on how to speak English correctly; the class does not include a grammar or literature component. (2) The utilization of bilingual aides called collaborators that are paired with English Language Learners (ELL) students to provide specific help with translation between English and Spanish and aid the student with adapting to the procedures of American education. (3) An English as a New Language (ELL) only summer school program, which focused on helping students to develop a higher English literacy level. (4) Currently there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> indicate that the number of Latino board members in Indiana has reached a significant enough level to exert a political influence on schools. (5) Currently there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> indicate that the number of Latino school administrators has reached a significant enough number to impact school programming. ...|$|E

40|$|From the {{standpoint}} of theoretical physics we can treat Newtonian cosmology as a problem in nonlinear dynamics. The attempt to average the density, {{in search of a}} method of making contact between theory and observation, is replaced by the more systematic idea of coarsegraining. I also explain in this context why two previous attempts at the construction of hierarchical models of the universe are not useful for data analysis. The main ideas behind two older competing data analyses purporting to show evidence from galaxy statistics for either a homogeneous and isotropic universe in one case, and for a mono-fractal universe in the other, are presented and discussed. I also present the method and results of a newer data analysis that shows that visible matter provides <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> allow us to claim that the cosmological principle holds, or that the universe is fractal (or multifractal). 1 In other words, observational data provides us with no evidence that that the universe is either homogeneous and isotropic, or hierarchical...|$|E
40|$|T H E disease {{known as}} chronic nephrosis or lipoid nephrosis {{has been the}} subject of {{continued}} dispute since the initial publications of Munk and of Epstein. Opinion still seems to be divided as to whether it is a type of glomerulonephritis or a distinct clinical and pathological entity. There is apparently an increasing amount of opinion favoring the latter view. In a series of 14 patients, who have been carefully followed since their dismissal from the hospital, all are alive and consider themselves well. All of the 14 show at the present time a normal blood chemistry and are entirely free from edema or any other physical abnormality. Seven of them, how-ever, still have an intermittent albuminuria. These patients have been under observation for periods varying from 10 to two years. What the future course may be would, perhaps, be hazardous to predict. At the present time, however, there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> lead one to expect a recurrence of the old disease.

40|$|We {{report a}} phylogenetic {{analysis}} of primate malaria parasites {{based on the}} gene encoding the cytochrome b protein from the mitochondrial genome. We have studied 17 species of Plasmodium, including 14 parasitic in primates. In our analysis, four species were used for rooting the Plasmodium phylogenetic tree: two from closely related genera (Hepatocystis sp. and Haemoproteus columbae) and two other Apicomplexa (Toxoplasma gondii and Theileria parva). We found that primate malaria parasites form a monophyletic group, with the only exception being the Plasmodium falciparum–Plasmodium reichenowi lineage. Phylogenetic analyses that include two species of non-Plasmodium Haemosporina suggest that the genus Plasmodium is polyphyletic. We conclude that the biologic traits, such as periodicity {{and the capacity to}} relapse, have limited value for assessing the phylogenetic relationships among Plasmodium species. For instance, we found <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> link virulence with the age of the host–parasite association. Our studies also reveal that the primate malaria parasites originated in Africa, which contradicts the presently held opinion of Southeast Asia as their center of origin. We propose that the radiation of Asian monkey parasites is a recent event where several life history traits, like differences in periodicity, appeared de novo...|$|E
