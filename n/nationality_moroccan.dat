30|$|Spain, {{which has}} long been a country of emigration, has become, within a few years, one of the European {{countries}} which welcomes the most foreign nationals onto its territory. These foreign nationals constitute a boon from a demographic point of view, limiting the depopulation of the territory induced by its accelerated ageing. Nevertheless, the establishment of foreign nationals is not a phenomenon that is equally distributed over the area. Indeed, foreign nationals are not equally located over Spanish territory. The spatial inequalities in their distribution merit specific attention, especially as they show significant differences according to countries of origin. Relying on data from municipal population registers (Padrón), this article offers a fine-scale, detailed exploration of the distribution of foreign nationals in Spain, to highlight the logic of differentiated occupation of Spanish space. The results show that certain nationalities occupy the territories without much sharing (Romanians and Bulgarians in rural areas for example), while others cohabit with different nationalities (Germans and English in recreational areas). Finally, certain <b>nationalities</b> (<b>Moroccans</b> in particular) are present in very specific locations, where there is an alternation of shared territories and exclusive occupation.|$|R

We base our assessment on a controlled experiment conducted on the profession of waiter.

First, there is evidence of a significant effect against the candidates with an Arab origin; second, there is evidence of residential discrimination against the candidates that are either the most qualified or of French origin. Overall, discrimination would tend to level down the employment opportunities of the candidates in underprivileged suburbs by putting at a disadvantage the candidates that are usually the most favored...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} aims of {{this study}} are to describe breakfast consumption patterns of south-eastern Spanish adolescents, examine the relationship between breakfast consumption and feelings of well-being and fitness and compare breakfast behaviour between men and women to identify if there is a gender gap. Design: A cross-sectional research with cluster sampling in two primary schools and seven secondary schools. The instrument used was {{a modified version of the}} Kidscreen- 27 questionnaire. Sample: 2, 125 students aged between 10 and 19 years old from different <b>nationalities,</b> mainly Romanian, <b>Moroccan</b> and Spanish. Results: The study identifies some youngsters who skip breakfast and no have no food intake over the course of the morning. About 35 % of the teenagers skip daily breakfast before they leave for school, and a worrying 1, 8 % do not eat any food during the whole morning. Questionnaire outcomes also expresses that the amount of biscuits ingested increased as the number of times that adolescents have breakfast at home decreases. There are significant gender differences, women it less foods than men. Differences are especially significant in case of milk, bread or cereals and butter or oil. Finally, chisquare contrast analysis show students that have breakfast before leaving to school perceive better feelings about how well and fit they are than those student who do not have breakfast daily. Conclusions. Findings supports the need for further enhance health education programs focused on breakfast habits, especially with women.

Curs acadèmic 2016 - 2017 The {{following}} paper {{describes the}} design and implementation of an ESL didactic unit for a 2 ºESO Spanish classroom that makes use of literary material as the core text around which the entire unit revolves around. Firstly, {{the pros and cons}} towards implementing literary texts in the classroom are provided, whether these texts should be authentic or simplified, what features should be taken into account when selecting what literary material will be used in the syllabus, and what were the methodologies used that inspired the design of this didactic unit. Ultimately, the book chosen was ‘‘Percy Jackson and The Lightning Thief’’. This unit is made up of four different sessions that use different fragments of the literary text to teach the appropriate usage of modal verbs ‘‘will’’, ‘‘going to’’, as well as permission modal verbs ‘‘can’’, ‘‘could’’ and ‘may’’, and ability modal verbs ‘‘can’’, ‘‘could’’ and ‘‘able to’’. The unit was implemented in the 2 ºESO B class at Torre del Rei high school, made up of 22 pupils of Spanish, Romanian and <b>Moroccan</b> <b>nationalities.</b> Students were also provided with three surveys: one survey handed in before the implementation process questioned students about their literary tastes and reading habits, and two others were handed in post-implementation, asking students about both implementations and how they would rather learn English. Only two sessions were permitted to be implemented because of time constraints, and due to technical difficulties encountered during the implementation of the first session of the didactic unit, this first session had to be repeated for a second implementation. Both implementation processes are described, recording both flaws and improvements encountered during both implementations, afterwards, proposals for improvement in accordance to the feedback received are provided. Due to lack of implementation, there is ultimately not enough data to decide whether this didactic unit could be considered successful, and further application is required. Nevertheless, since most students seemed thrilled and excited about using authentic literary material, and of learning through innovative tasks and exercises, initial impressions regarding this didactic unit appear to be positive. However, complications such as student refusal towards interacting using the target language, and time control issues are matters that require attention in future implementations...|$|R
40|$|No ISSNIn {{this article}} we {{examined}} the intersection between religious and ethnic border crossing. On the one hand we applied the interactional ‘boundary approach’ of F. Barth, {{and on the other}} hand we assessed the process of ethnic passing by the adoption of ‘surface pointers’ (Nash 1996). It appears from our study that for both groups of ‘converts’, from Islam to Evangelism, and from secular Christianity to Islam, the border crossing entails much more than a merely religious passing and the adoption of purely spiritual values and religious convictions. In both the categories of converts studied we can conclude that the religious ‘border crossing’ also contains ethnic components, without it actually being a complete ethnic transition. It is noteworthy that in both cases the converts also attempt to link their religious conversion process to an ethnic acknowledgement by the new community, in particular by taking on ethnic ‘markers’. The idea that a religious transition can be felt to be imperfect has to do with the connotation that exists between religion and ethnicity (or even nationality), especially in the case of Islam in Morocco where this connotation is given an official construal through the fact that the Moroccan king is also the country’s religious leader. Moroccan Muslims who convert to Christianity in Belgium remain bound to the Umma on the basis of their inalienable <b>Moroccan</b> <b>nationality.</b> By distancing themselves from Islam as a religion, these people enter an area of political and ethnic tension, which explains why informants in this category are extremely difficult to reach. With the secular/Christian converts to Islam, the connotation between religion and ethnicity leads to these converts adopting the cultural-ethnic characteristics of mostly Moroccan Islam, in order to make their religious conversion appear more complete to insiders (ethnic Muslims) and outsiders (secular/Christian westerners). Even though both Christianity and Islam are religions with a universalist message whereby religion transcends ethnic boundaries, yet it is an unavoidable fact that in the multi-ethnic environment in which the study was conducted, ethnic and religious boundaries in part coincide, so that each religious ‘transition’ also supposes an ethnic repositioning within the societal context. While the religious boundary can be crossed with ease, it appears that the ethnic boundary is much more unyielding, and that it is also the components of ethnic identity that ensure that the converts end up with an ‘in-between’ status. Historic case studies (Stallaert 2003; 2007) have shown that the status of ‘convert’ can take the form of a new religious-ethnic category, which in the first place is the product of the perception of outsiders (in this case, the ‘ethnic’ Muslims and Christians). In such cases, however, the ethnic profiling enters also clearly at median and even partly at macro levels, what is currently not the case in Belgium with new Muslims (with the exception of some median profiling, see Leman, Stallaert and Lechkar 2010, in JEMS, see Lirias) and new Christians. status: publishe...|$|R
