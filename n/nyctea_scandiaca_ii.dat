50|$|The {{coloration}} of the owl’s plumage plays a {{key role}} in its ability to sit still and blend into the environment, making it nearly invisible to prey. Owls tend to mimic the colorations and sometimes even the texture patterns of their surroundings, the common barn owl being an exception. <b>Nyctea</b> <b>scandiaca,</b> or the snowy owl, appears nearly bleach-white in color with a few flecks of black, mimicking their snowy surroundings perfectly. Likewise, the mottled wood-owl (Strix ocellata) displays shades of brown, tan, and black, making the owl nearly invisible in the surrounding trees, especially from behind. Usually, the only tell-tale sign of a perched owl is its vocalizations or its vividly colored eyes.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} study of Late Pleistocene fossil bird remains from Ingarano (Apulia, SE Italy), based on the {{revision}} of previously published material {{and the study of}} unpublished fossils bones. New field observations make it possible to simplify the stratigraphy of the deposit compared to previous work. The systematic study of the fossil bird bones revealed the presence of 15 taxa, including two hypothetical ones: Circus aeruginosus, Buteo rufinus, Aquila chrysaëtos, Falco columbarius, Falco cherrug, Alectoris graeca, Perdix perdix, Columba livia, Otus scops, <b>Nyctea</b> <b>scandiaca,</b> <b>Nyctea</b> <b>scandiaca</b> vel Bubo bubo, Athene noctua, Pyrrho corax graculus, Pyrrho corax pyrrho corax, Corvus corone, Corvus corone vel Corvus frugilegus, Corvus corax. Our detailed study also helps improve the taphonomical interpretation of the deposit: the remains from the lower layers were accumulated after mammalian predator activity and were transported over short distances, while the ones from the upper layers show sings of intense transport, such as fractures and surface abrasion. Two different bird assemblages were recognized, respectively from the lowermost and the upper layers of the clastic succession exposed in the Ingarano deposit; this difference is also confirmed by the fossil mammal remains. The systematic study makes it possible to make palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic reconstructions: both assemblages indicate open environments, and the taxa of the lower layers indicate the presence of woods and wetlands with colder characteristics, while birds of the upper layers indicate drier and warmer conditions. This analysis, and the dating established through geochemical analyses and study of lithic artefacts, lead us to date the formation of the Ingarano deposit to the Late Pleistocene, in particular to the MIS 3. The presence of a layer dated to the MIS 2 {{at the base of the}} succession indicated in previous works cannot be confirmed.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that snowy owls <b>Nyctea</b> <b>scandiaca</b> defend an area around their nests against predators, hereby inadvertently creating safe havens for breeding dark-bellied brent geese Branta b. bernicla. However, studies investigating brent goose breeding ecology within the predator-exclusion zones of the snowy owls are absent. In 1999 and 2005, years of high lemming abundance Lemmus sibiricus and Dicrostonyx torquatus, brent geese were primarily breeding in association with snowy owls in the Medusa river catchment on western Taimyr, Russia. Goose nest failure, either as a result of nest abandonment by the adult birds or of nest depredation, increased with increasing distance from the owl nests. Within the brent goose colonies, clutch size as well as egg size increased with decreasing distance from the snowy owl nest, indicating an increasing adult quality closer to owl nests. However, {{as a result of the}} abandonment of eggs and goslings, the increasing clutch size did not result in a higher nest success during this study. Apparently brent geese compete for breeding sitesclose to owl nests, but details of this process remain unknown...|$|R
40|$|Behaviour and {{activity}} levels were measured in varying lemmings experimentally {{infected with the}} heteroxenous parasite, Sarcocystis rauschorum {{to test the hypothesis}} that the parasite alters behaviour of this intermediate host and thereby increases probability of transmission to the definitive host, the snowy owl (<b>Nyctea</b> <b>scandiaca).</b> Measures of short-term activity levels on a running wheel indicated no effect of the parasite, either directly, or indirectly as a result of illness. We observed behaviour of infected lemmings placed in an 'open field' (arena). Lemmings would increase their susceptibility to predators if they spent more time away from cover, used crypsis (stationary postures) less, spent more time exploring (especially in unfamiliar areas), or responded inappropriately to threats from predators. We found that only exploratory activity showed significant change after infection. The frequency of exploratory activity increased and became disassociated from the usual fear response. This may increase the lemmings' susceptibility to aerial predation. The mechanism for this effect is unknown, but neurological lesions have been observed. The examination of the modes of transmission of the S. rauschorum parasite within lemming populations and of a possible fecundity compensation strategy adopted by the lemmings, and their relevance to population control, are suggested as areas for future study.

40|$|Fieldwork in {{different}} parts of Severnaya Zemlya in 1985, 1991, 1992 and 1993 and aerial surveys in 1994 revealed a limited bird fauna with a total of 17 breeding species. The most numerous breeding birds are cliff-nesting seabirds, comprising little auk (Alle alle), 10 000 - 80 000 pairs; kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), 5000 - 10 000; black guillemot (Cepphus grylle), 1000 - 5000; ivory gull (Pagophila eburnea), 1000 - 2000; and glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus), 500 - 1000. They breed all over the archipelago, usually in rather small mixed- or single-species colonies. Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea) 100 - 500, and herring gull (Larus argentatus) 1 - 10, breed as solitary pairs or with a few pairs together. Of tundra birds, only brent goose (Branta bernicla), purple sandpiper (Calidris maritima) and snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis) are found breeding on most of the major islands. The other tundra species-red-throated diver (Gavia stellata), king eider (Somateria spectabilis), sanderling (Calidris alba), Arctic skua (Stercorarius parasiticus), long-tailed skua (Stercorarius longicaudus), snowy owl (<b>Nyctea</b> <b>scandiaca)</b> and Lapland bunting (Calcarius lapponicus) -breed in small numbers and in limited areas, often not every year. Of the even fewer mammal species, reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) occurs occasionally, while Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) and collared lemming (Dicrostonyx torquatus) are locally common in some years...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the sarcocyst of Sarcocystis rauschorum in its intermediate host was studied. Lemmings were orally administered sporocysts of S. rauschorum obtained from snowy owls (<b>Nyctea</b> <b>scandiaca).</b> Beginning at 9 days postinoculation (DPI) and at various intervals to 84 DPI, skeletal muscle tissue taken from the infected lemmings was examined by electron microscopy. At 9 DPI the sarcocysts contained few metrocytes and the cyst wall was flat. The metrocytes underwent endodyogeny, {{and within a few}} days the cyst wall of the rapidly growing sarcocyst developed numerous tubulovesicular invaginations into the electron-dense layer, and the wall had a few irregular infoldings. By 21 DPI, banana-shaped bradyzoites appeared, and by 84 DPI the mature cysts were filled with bradyzoites in groups subdivided by septa and by deep infoldings of the cyst wall. The fine structure of the wall remained simple throughout maturation, with no conspicuous invagination or protrusion. The sarcocyst produced in response to S. rauschorum is unlike those from many species of Sarcocystis, which have complex walls that change markedly as the sarcocysts mature; however, its simple appearance is similar to other species that have rodents as intermediate hosts and raptorial birds as definitive hosts.

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{predator}} protection and similar habitat hypotheses {{in relation to}} red-breasted goose, Branta ruficollis, nesting associations. Geese began laying 1 - 3 weeks after all associated species. In almost all cases they nested on the mainland only if raptors were also present and always followed raptors when they changed eyries between years. They selected peregrines, Falco peregrinus, and snowy owls, <b>Nyctea</b> <b>scandiaca,</b> as associates in preference to rough-legged buzzards, Buteo lagopus, even though the latter were several times more abundant along river corridors. Nest defence experiments with a surrogate Arctic fox, Alopex lagopus, showed {{that this could be}} explained by differences in nest defence intensity, rather than habitat types selected. Similar experiments also suggested that gulls were much less aggressive than owls or falcons. Foxes rarely approached, and were easily repelled from goose colonies associated with owls and peregrines, but gulls were apparently incapable of repelling foxes. Breeding success was much higher for geese nesting with raptors than for those on islands and geese apparently preferred to nest with owls in peak lemming years than to remain on islands. These findings support the hypothesis that red-breasted geese actively choose to nest near raptors; however, they probably associate with gulls primarily because both species select fox-free islands. Compared with other studies, red-breasted geese nesting with raptors and on islands apparently represent two extremes in a continuum of nesting associations generally seen in birds. We discuss why the behaviour might have evolved and argue that this may be the only known bird species whose evolution has been facilitated primarily by the exploitation of the nest defence behaviour of aggressive raptorial hosts.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we aim to}} explain the {{distribution}} of red-breasted geese Branta ruficollis over different nesting habitats. To be safe from land predators red-breasted goose colonies were restricted to i) islands on rivers, ii) cliffs with peregrine falcons Falco peregrinus, and iii) the close proximity of snowy owl <b>Nyctea</b> <b>scandiaca</b> and rough-legged buzzard Buteo lagopus nests. Among years nest site availability varied by fluctuations in numbers of owls and buzzards in association with cycles in lemming abundance, but {{the total number of}} goose nests found in the study area did not vary. The distribution of geese, in combination with data on reproductive success, suggested a despotic mechanism: at cliffs, goose numbers were constant among years with an invariably high reproductive success, whereas large fluctuations in numbers on islands coincided with opposite trends in success. Apparently, geese nesting with owls or buzzards moved to the few islands present in the study area during years when these birds of prey were absent. Consequently, in such years the average density of geese on islands was more than twice as high as at cliff colonies (5. 4 and 2. 3 pairs per ha of foraging habitat, respectively). Colony size at cliffs may have been restricted by territorial behaviour of the geese, though there is evidence that, additionally, the host falcons also limited the number of nesting geese. Apparently rare in closely related species, we observed a negative density-dependent effect on reproductive success during the nest phase, and attribute this to limited food resources, reinforced by the high frequency of territorial interactions. This leads to the conclusion that, in addition to predation pressure, nesting density is an important agent in the link between lemming cycles and goose breeding success...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Wildlife Management, 1975 This thesis {{reports the}} results of a study on the time and {{activity}} patterns, ecological energetics, predatory efficiency, and caching behavior of American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) wintering in the vicinity of Arcata, Humboldt County, California. Several studies on the time and activity budgets of birds have been conducted in recent years. Most were conducted during the breeding season (Orians 1961, Verner 1965, Schartz and Zimmerman 1971, Verbeek 1972); only two (Pearson 1954, Verbeek 1964) involved wintering birds. The study reported here on the American Kestrel also was conducted during the winter. In this study I monitored the behavioral patterns of single birds not involved in reproductive activities. Some time and activity data were reported for White-tailed Kites (Elanus leucurus) (Stendell 1972, Bammann 1975) and breeding Kestrels (Balgooyen 1972). Ueoka (1974) quantified the time and activity patterns of predatory behavior of Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) in relation to the breeding season. Levenson (in progress) is studying the time and activity patterns of Ospreys at their nests. Schnell (1967) studied the influence of environmental conditions on the incidence of flight in Rough-legged Hawks (Buteo lagopus). The energy expenditure of raptorial birds in the field has been estimated only for the Snowy Owl (<b>Nyctea</b> <b>scandiaca)</b> (Gessaman 1972). Gessaman (1973) is currently conducting laboratory research which, when perfected, will provide a sophisticated energy budget for the American Kestrel. In the present study, the energy expenditure of Kestrels was predicted following deterministic models developed by Koplin (1972, and in prep.). The predicted energy expenditure was compared with observed caloric intake as a means of testing the valid-' ity of the deterministic model. The efficiency of predators in obtaining prey recently has interested field biologists. The predatory efficiency of Kestrels was studied during the non-breeding season in Costa Rica (Jenkins 1970) and in Michigan (Sparrowe 1972), and during the breeding season in Califor-nia (Balgooyen 1972). Ueoka (1974) reviewed the literature on hunting efficiency of birds and mammals and presented data on the hunting efficiency of Ospreys. Additional studies concerned with hunting efficiency were conducted on White-tailed Kites (Stendell 1972, Bammann 1975), Snowy Owls (Rohn 1974) and several non-raptorial birds (Orians 1969, Dunn 1972, Recher and Recher 1972, Dinsmore 1973, Schlorff in progress). Prey caching has been documented for many raptors. Among falcon - iforms, prey caching has been reported in American Kestrels (Pierce 1937, Tordoff 1955, Roest 1957, Stendell and Waian 1968, Balgooyen 1972, Mueller 1974), Merlins (Falco columbarius) (Greaves 1968), and Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) (Schnell 1958, Gullion 1965). Prey caching also has been observed in many owls (Allen 1924, Lockley 1938, Wallace 1948, Raber 1950, Mossman 1955, Jansson 1964, Norburg 1964, Grant 1965, Ligon 1968, Catling 1972) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the movement patterns of {{two groups of}} birds which are generally regarded as irruptive migrants, namely (a) boreal finches and others that depend on fluctuating tree-fruit crops, and (b) owls and others that depend on cyclically fluctuating rodent populations. Both groups specialise on food supplies which, in particular regions, fluctuate more than 100 -fold from year to year. However, seed-crops in widely separated regions may fluctuate independently of one another, as may rodent populations, so that poor food supplies in one region may coincide with good supplies in another. If individuals are {{to have access to}} rich food supplies every year, they must often move hundreds or thousands of kilometres from one breeding area to another. In years of widespread food shortage (or high numbers relative to food supplies) extending many thousands or millions of square kilometres, large numbers of individuals migrate to lower latitudes, as an ‘irruptive migration’. For these reasons, the distribution of the population, in both summer and winter, varies greatly from year to year. In particular breeding areas, many species of irruptive migrants fluctuate in density according to food supplies at the time. The facts that the response to food change is rapid, and that increases in numbers from one year to the next are often greater than can be explained by high survival and reproduction from the previous year, imply that such year to year density changes are due mainly to movements. Ring recoveries and other data lend support to this view. In irruptive migrants, in contrast to regular migrants, site fidelity is poor, and few individuals return to the same breeding areas in successive years (apart from owls in the increase phase of a rodent cycle). Moreover, ring recoveries and radio-tracking confirm that the same individuals can breed in different years in areas separated by hundreds or thousands of kilometres. Extreme examples are provided by Common Crossbills Loxia curvirostra, in which individual adults were found in localities up to 3200 km apart in different breeding seasons, and Snowy Owls <b>Nyctea</b> <b>scandiaca</b> found in localities up to nearly 2000 km apart. The implication from irruptive migrations, that individuals can winter in widely separated localities in different years, is also supported by ring recoveries, at least in seed-eaters, in which individuals have been found in one winter hundreds or thousands of kilometres from where they were ringed in a previous winter. Most such shifts could be regarded as lying at different points on the same migration axis, but some were apparently on different axes, as the birds were recovered in winter far to the east or west of where they were ringed in a previous winter. Extreme examples include a Bohemian Waxwing Bombycilla garrulus (6000 km, Ukraine to Siberia), a Siskin Carduelis spinus (3000 km, Sweden to Iran), a Pine Siskin Carduelis pinus (3950 km, Quebec to California), and a Common Redpoll Carduelis flammea (8350 km, Belgium to China). Compared to regular (obligate) migrants, irruptive (facultative) migrants show much greater year to year variations in the proportions of individuals that migrate, and greater individual and year to year variations in the timing, directions and distances of movements. The control systems are flexible in irruptive migrants, enabling individuals to respond to feeding conditions at the time. However, regular and irruptive migrants are probably best regarded, not as distinct categories, but as representing opposite extremes of a continuum of migratory behaviour found among birds, from narrow and consistent at one end to broad and flexible at the other. Both systems are adaptive, the one to conditions in which resource levels are predictable in space and time, and the other to conditions in which resource levels are unpredictable. Depending on the predictability and stability of its food supply, the same species may behave as a resident or regular migrant in one part of its range, and as an irruptive migrant in another, as exemplified by particular species of both seed-eaters and rodent-eaters...|$|R
