5|$|White supremacists, {{such as the}} Ku Klux Klan (KKK), used {{paramilitary}} {{violence to}} prevent blacks from voting. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> were killed at the Colfax massacre of 1873 while attempting to defend their right to vote. The Enforcement Acts were passed by Congress in 1870–1871 to authorize federal prosecution of the KKK and others who violated the amendment. However, as Reconstruction neared its end and federal troops withdrew, prosecutions under the Enforcement Acts dropped significantly. In United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the Supreme Court ruled {{that the federal government}} did not have the authority to prosecute the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre because they were not state actors.|$|E

25|$|In the 1820s, {{when the}} rest of Spain's empire in Latin America rebelled and formed {{independent}} states, Cuba remained loyal. Its economy was based on serving the empire. By 1860, Cuba had 213,167 free people of color, 39% of its non-White population of 550,000. By contrast, Virginia with about the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks,</b> had only 58,042 or 11% who were free; the rest were enslaved. In the antebellum years, Virginia discouraged manumissions after the Nat Turner's Slave Rebellion of 1831 and strengthened restrictions against free blacks, as did other southern states. In addition, there was a high demand for slaves, and Virginia planters sold many in the internal domestic slave trade, to be shipped or taken overland to the Deep South, which had greatly expanded its cotton production.|$|E
25|$|Slave-ownership was {{the primary}} marker of class and even the town's freedmen and other people of color {{typically}} kept slaves {{if they had the}} wealth to do so. Visitors commonly remarked on the sheer <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> in Charleston and their seeming freedom of movement, though in fact—mindful of the Stono Rebellion and the violent slave revolution that established Haiti—the whites closely regulated the behavior of both slaves and free people of color. Wages and hiring practices were fixed, identifying badges were sometimes required, and even work songs were sometimes censored. Punishment was handled out of sight by the city's Work House, whose fees netting the municipal government thousands a year. In 1820, a state law mandated that each individual act of freeing a slave henceforth legislative approval, effectively halting the practice.|$|E

Kaszak endorsed Shiller, although many of Kaszak's followers supported Orbach. Orbach tried to position himself {{on both sides of}} the pro-/anti-Washington political fence, and late in the campaign attempted to stage a public conversion to pro-Washington positions. Some prominent independents, such as Alderman Marion Volini (48th), state Representative Ellis Levin and state Senator William A. Marovitz, endorsed Orbach, as did the Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune. [...] "His [...] relationship to large real estate developers is very important. He's become more of an advocate for people outside of the ward than for people here," [...] Shiller charged. Some of Orbach's allies spread a rumor, aimed at lakefront Jewish voters, that as alderman Shiller would support a Palestinian state. Shiller's forces called Orbach a racist, although a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> backed Orbach in his early campaigns. Shiller later said, ...|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after the}} dam was authorized, {{increasing}} numbers of unemployed people converged on southern Nevada. Las Vegas, then a small city of some 5,000, saw between 10,000 and 20,000 unemployed descend on it. A government camp was established for surveyors and other personnel near the dam site; this soon became surrounded by a squatters' camp. Known as McKeeversville, the camp was home to men hoping for work on the project, together with their families. Another camp, on the flats along the Colorado River, was officially called Williamsville, but was known to its inhabitants as [...] "Ragtown". When construction began, Six Companies hired large numbers of workers, with more than 3,000 on the payroll by 1932 and with employment peaking at 5,251 in July 1934. [...] "Mongolian" [...] (Chinese) labor was prevented by the construction contract, while the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> employed by Six Companies never exceeded thirty, mostly lowest-pay-scale laborers in a segregated crew, who were issued separate water buckets.|$|E
500|$|Still, Blassingame {{concludes that}} {{cross-cultural}} exchanges occurred on southern plantations, arguing that [...] "acculturation in the United States involved the mutual interaction between two cultures, with Europeans and Africans borrowing from each other." [...] Blassingame {{asserts that the}} most significant instance revolved around Protestant Christianity (primarily Baptist and Methodist churches): [...] "The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> who received religious instruction in antebellum white churches is significant because the church was the only institution other than the plantation which {{played a major role}} in acculturating the slave." [...] Christianity and enslaved black ministers slowly replaced African religious survivals and represented another aspect of slave culture which the slaves used to create their own communities. While ministers preached obedience in the presence of the slaveowners and other whites, slaves often met in secret, [...] "invisible" [...] services unsupervised by whites. In these [...] "invisible churches", slaves could discuss freedom, liberty, and the judgment of God against slaveowners.|$|E

2500|$|Starting in the 1930s, the {{demographics}} of the population pivoted toward an African-American and Latino majority. Most of the new residents were poor and socially disadvantaged, especially the new African-American residents, who were mostly migrants from the Jim Crow-era South where they were racially discriminated against. In 1940, black residents made up 6% of Brownsville's population, but by 1950, there were double the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks,</b> most of whom occupied the neighborhood's most undesirable housing. At the same time, new immigration quotas reduced the number of Russian Jews who were able to immigrate to the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Under King Louis XVI, {{the order}} of the Conseil du Roi of 5 April 1778, signed by Antoine de Sartine, forbade [...] "whites of either sex to {{contract}} marriage with blacks, mulattos or other people of color" [...] in the Kingdom, as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> had increased so much in France, mostly in the capital. Nevertheless, it was an interracial marriage prohibition, not an interracial sex prohibition. Moreover, it was an administrative act, not a law. There was never any racial law about marriage in France, with the exception of French Louisiana. But some restricted rules were applied about heritage and nobility. In any case, nobles needed the King's authorization for their marriage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{war years}} contributed to {{additional}} {{dramatic changes in}} city population. The presence of the Union Army attracted many fugitive slaves who escaped from surrounding rural plantations.

2500|$|Cricket was {{traditionally}} {{popular among}} English-speaking whites, and the Asian/Muslim community, though {{the latter were}} not able to compete in top level South African cricket in the Apartheid era. Since the end of the Apartheid era a higher proportion of white players have come from Afrikaans-speaking backgrounds like Lance Klusener, Kepler Wessels, Hansie Cronje, Allan Donald, Boeta Dippenaar, Herschelle Gibbs, AB de Villiers, Quinton de Kock, Francois du Plessis, Rilee Rossouw, JP Duminy, Charl Langeveldt, Morne Morkel, Dale Steyn among others. Its popularity has grown markedly amongst other groups, though cricket remains the favourite sport for Coloured and Asian/Indian/Muslim South Africans as well as people of English descent. This has other reasons, since cricket can be an expensive and is a typically middle class game, it does not appeal to blacks like football or rugby union does. However, a considerable <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> have played cricket for South Africa since the late 1990s, the most notable being Makhaya Ntini, who was the first black cricketer to play for South Africa, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Aaron Phangiso, Kagiso Rabada [...] and Temba Bavuma.|$|E
