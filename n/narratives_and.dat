It was also well received by scientists, who praised its accuracy. Commercially, the film was a box office success. Budgeted at $60 million, Contagion attained $135 million in box office revenue during its theatrical run.|$|E
5|$|Greek mythology is {{explicitly}} embodied {{in a large}} collection of <b>narratives,</b> <b>and</b> implicitly in Greek representational arts, such as ancient vase-paintings and votive gifts. Greek myth attempts to explain {{the origins of the}} world, and details the lives and adventures {{of a wide variety of}} gods, goddesses, heroes, heroines and mythological creatures. These accounts initially were disseminated in an oral-poetic tradition; today the Greek myths are known primarily from ancient Greek literature.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to frame the}} fundamentals by which we tell <b>and</b> preserve history, <b>narrative,</b> <b>and</b> story. The exploration seeks to understand the necessity {{and complexity of the}} preservation of memory <b>and</b> of <b>narrative</b> <b>and</b> story. Culture may be understood as a collection of narratives. Understanding ourselves requires an understanding of how and why we create history, <b>narrative,</b> <b>and</b> story. Two Holocaust <b>narratives</b> of cultural <b>and</b> literary importance are investigated – Primo Levi’s If This Is A Man and Art Spiegelman’s Maus. Two different ways of telling and preserving stories about the Holocaust have had great impact upon Cultural and Holocaust studies, these stories have raised lasting questions on morals and ethics. By framing these works within my own <b>narrative,</b> <b>and</b> <b>narrative</b> theory, I have attempted to personalize and understand the construction of <b>narrative</b> <b>and</b> the relationship between writer/artist, and memory, and the larger relationship to history, <b>narrative,</b> <b>and</b> story...|$|R

5|$|Hamlet {{is one of}} {{the most}} quoted works in the English language, and is often {{included}} on lists of the world's greatest literature. As such, it reverberates through the writing of later centuries. Academic Laurie Osborne identifies the direct influence of Hamlet in numerous modern <b>narratives,</b> <b>and</b> divides them into four main categories: fictional accounts of the play's composition, simplifications of the story for young readers, stories expanding the role of one or more characters, and narratives featuring performances of the play.|$|E
5|$|Dishonored {{received}} positive reviews, {{focusing on}} the missions' individual <b>narratives</b> <b>and</b> the freedom available in completing them. Criticism fell on the overarching narrative, which was considered predictable, and problems in controlling the player's character. The game won several awards, including the 2012 Spike Video Game award for Best Action-Adventure Game and the 2013 BAFTA award for Best Game, and was repeatedly recognized as the best action-adventure game of 2012 and one of that year's best games. Dishonored was initially released on 9 October 2012, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, and was later supplemented with additional content {{focusing on the}} assassin Daud and his quest for redemption. PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game were released in August 2015, and a sequel, Dishonored 2, was released in November 2016.|$|E

Blyton's books are still {{enormously}} popular, and have been translated into 90 languages; her first book, Child Whispers, a 24-page collection of poems, was published in 1922.

5|$|The 1970s, however, {{witnessed}} {{the publication of}} revisionist studies that departed from the traditional historiography of slavery.

Genovese's Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made (1974), Peter H. Wood, Black Majority: Negroes in Colonial South Carolina from 1670 Through the Stono Rebellion (1974), Leslie Howard Owens's This Species of Property: Slave Life and Culture in the Old South (1976), Herbert G. Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom, 1750–1925 (1976), and Lawrence W. Levine's Black Culture and Black Consciousness: Afro-American Folk Thought from Slavery to Freedom (1977). One of the more controversial of these studies was John W. Blassingame's The Slave Community.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{designers}} performed {{extensive research}} in Hong Kong {{to create an}} accurate portrayal of the city. Art designers spent seven days in Hong Kong, where they studied the city's environment, and took more than 20,000 photos as references for the physical environment in the game. They travelled on foot to various locales, such as clubs and malls, and interviewed ex-Triad members and retired members of the Hong Kong Police Force Anti-Triad unit, which inspired <b>narratives</b> <b>and</b> character design. The sound designers spent ten days in the city overseeing the dialogue sessions on weekdays and capturing ambient noises around the city at weekends.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{most people}} in the western world know the planets by names derived from the Olympian pantheon of gods. Although modern Greeks still use their ancient names for the planets, other European languages, because of the {{influence}} of the Roman Empire and, later, the Catholic Church, use the Roman (Latin) names rather than the Greek ones. The Romans, who, like the Greeks, were Indo-Europeans, shared with them a common pantheon under different names but lacked the rich narrative traditions that Greek poetic culture had given their gods. During the later period of the Roman Republic, Roman writers borrowed much of the Greek <b>narratives</b> <b>and</b> applied them to their own pantheon, {{to the point where they}} became virtually indistinguishable. When the Romans studied Greek astronomy, they gave the planets their own gods' names: Mercurius (for Hermes), Venus (Aphrodite), Mars (Ares), Iuppiter (Zeus) and Saturnus (Cronus). When subsequent planets were discovered in the 18th and 19th centuries, the naming practice was retained with Neptūnus (Poseidon). Uranus is unique in that it is named for a Greek deity rather than his Roman counterpart.|$|E
