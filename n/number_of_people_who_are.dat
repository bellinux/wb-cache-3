5|$|Former World Bank Chief Economist {{and former}} Chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Joseph E. Stiglitz {{referred}} {{in the late}} 1990s to a growing consensus {{that something is wrong}} with a system having the capacity to impose high costs on a great <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> hardly even participants in international financial markets, neither speculating on international investments nor borrowing in foreign currencies. He argued that foreign crises have strong worldwide repercussions {{due in part to the}} phenomenon of moral hazard, particularly when many multinational firms deliberately invest in highly risky government bonds in anticipation of a national or international bailout. Although crises can be overcome by emergency financing, employing bailouts places a heavy burden on taxpayers living in the afflicted countries, and the high costs damage standards of living. Stiglitz has advocated finding means of stabilizing short-term international capital flows without adversely affecting long-term foreign direct investment which usually carries new knowledge spillover and technological advancements into economies.|$|E

In some cases, automatic mixers are used to control the levels of the microphones, and turn off the channels for microphones which are not being spoken into, to reduce unwanted background noise and reduce the likelihood of feedback.|$|E
25|$|The {{resurgence}} of prostitution in mainland China has {{coincided with the}} introduction of Deng Xiaoping's liberalisation of Chinese economic policy in 1978. According to the incomplete statistics composed on the basis of nationwide crackdowns, the rate of prostitution in China has been rising every year since 1982. Between 1989 and 1990, 243,183 people were apprehended for prostitution-related activities. Zhang Ping estimates that such police figures only account for around 25–30 percent of the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> actually involved. Prostitution is an increasingly large part of the Chinese economy, employing perhaps 10million people, with an annual level of consumption of possibly 1trillion RMB. Following a 2000 police campaign, Chinese economist Yang Fan estimated that the Chinese GDP slumped by 1%, as a result of decreased spending by newly unemployed female prostitutes.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} an aerial shot of a block in Los Angeles, and clips of radio {{broadcasts}} are heard with disc jockeys stating that U2 is planning on performing a concert downtown and expecting crowds of 30,000 people. Police show up to the set and inform the band's crew of the security issue that the film shoot is causing, due to the large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> coming to watch the performance. [...] Two minutes into the video, U2 are seen {{on the roof of}} a liquor store at the corner of 7th St. and S. Main St., and perform [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] to a large crowd of people standing in the streets surrounding the building. Towards the end of the song, the police tell the crew that the performance is about to be shut down, and eventually police walk onto the roof while the crowd are booing the police.|$|E
500|$|In March 1967, the United States Senate Committee on Labor's Subcommittee on Poverty held {{a series}} of hearings, as part of the ongoing [...] "War on Poverty." [...] One of the testifying {{witnesses}} was Marian Wright, a 27 year-old Yale Law School graduate working with the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund in Mississippi. She told the subcommittee that increased mechanization and requirements that cotton fields lie fallow under federal subsidy stipulations had put thousands of black sharecroppers out of work in the Mississippi Delta. In addition to this, two-parent families were ineligible for many welfare benefits, and most counties in Mississippi had switched welfare programs from one that distributed surplus food to an alternative that required a monthly purchase of food stamps. With little to no income, most households could not produce the necessary funds. As a result, Wright argued, Mississippians were [...] "starving. They're starving, and those who can get the bus fare to go north are trying to go north... I wish that [...] would have a chance to go and just look at the empty cupboards in the Delta and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> going around and begging just to feed their children." ...|$|E

Price testified on March 4, 2014 about his 2012 study that reached a different conclusion than Rosenfeld using the same data set.

60|$|Fortunately we {{have not}} to begin {{absolutely}} from the beginning: we already have, in the Medical Officer of Health, a sort of doctor who is free from the worst hardships, and consequently from the worst vices, of the private practitioner. His position depends, not on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> ill, and whom he can keep ill, but on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> well. He is judged, as all doctors and treatments should be judged, by the vital statistics of his district. When the death rate goes up his credit goes down. As every increase in his salary depends {{on the issue of}} a public debate as {{to the health of the}} constituency under his charge, he has every inducement to strive towards the ideal of a clean bill of health. He has a safe, dignified, responsible, independent position based wholly on the public health; whereas the private practitioner has a precarious, shabby-genteel, irresponsible, servile position, based wholly on the prevalence of illness.|$|E
60|$|Thus I would {{desire that}} the biographies {{of many of}} our most illustrious personages of romance should be {{continued}} by fitting hands, {{and that they should}} be heard of, until at least a decent age.--Look at Mr. James's heroes: they invariably marry young. Look at Mr. Dickens's: they disappear from the scene when they are mere chits. I trust these authors, who are still alive, will see the propriety of telling us something more about people in whom we took a considerable interest, and who must be at present strong and hearty, and in the full vigor of health and intellect. And in the tales of the great Sir Walter (may honor be to his name), I am sure there are a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> untimely carried away from us, and of whom we ought to hear more.|$|E
60|$|Now first I would ask, is any really {{continuous}} and thorough mental process {{going on at}} all about this war? I mean, is there any considerable <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> seeing it as a whole, taking it in as a whole, {{trying to get a}} general idea of it from which they can form directing conclusions for the future? Is there any considerable number of people even trying to do that? At any rate let me point out first that there is quite an enormous mass of people who--in {{spite of the fact that}} their minds are concentrated on aspects of this war, who are at present hearing, talking, experiencing little else than the war--are nevertheless neither doing nor trying to do anything that deserves to be called thinking about it at all. They may even be suffering quite terribly by it. But they are no more mastering its causes, reasons, conditions, and the possibility of its future prevention than a monkey that has been rescued in a scorching condition from the burning of a house will have mastered the problem of a fire. It is just happening to and about them. It may, for anything they have learnt about it, happen to them again.|$|E

60|$|There {{is first}} the old {{traditional}} curriculum, the learning by rote {{of the classics}} without explanation in early youth, followed by a more intelligent study in later years. This is exactly like the traditional study of the classics in this country, as it existed, for example, in the eighteenth century. Men over thirty, even if, in the end, they have secured a thoroughly modern education, have almost all begun by learning reading and writing in old-fashioned schools. Such schools still form the majority, and give most of the elementary education that is given. Every child has to learn by heart every day some portion of the classical text, and repeat it out loud in class. As they all repeat at the same time, the din is deafening. (In Peking I lived {{next to one of}} these schools, so I can speak from experience.) The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> taught to read by these methods is considerable; in the large towns one finds that even coolies can read as often as not. But writing (which is very difficult in Chinese) is a much rarer accomplishment. Probably those who can both read and write form about five per cent, of the population.|$|E

[...] But there was no picking in this case. The great piled banks were all [...] "equal to sample," [...] and beyond them lay piles of small, broken, [...] "smithy" [...] coal. [...] "The Company doesn't sell to the public. This small, broken coal is an exception. That is sold, but the big stuff is for the engines and the shops. It doesn't cost much to get out, as you say; but our men can earn as much as twelve rupees a month. Very often when they've earned enough to go on with they retire from the concern till they've spent their money and then come on again. It's piece-work and they are improvident. If some of them only lived like other natives they would have enough to buy land and cows with. When there's a press of work they make a good deal by overtime, but they don't seem to keep it. You should see Giridih Bazaar on a Sunday {{if you want to know}} where the money goes. About ten thousand rupees change hands once a week there. If you want to get at the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> indirectly dependent or profit by the E. I. R. you'll have to conduct a census of your own. After Sunday is over the men generally lie off on Monday and take it easy on Tuesday. Then they work hard for the next four days and make it up. Of course there's nothing in the wide world to prevent a man from resigning and going away to wherever he came from--behind those hills if he's a Sonthal. He loses his employment, that's all. But they have their own point of honour. A man hates to be told by his friends that he has been guilty of shirking. And now we'll go to breakfast. You shall be 'pitted' to-morrow to any depth you like." ...|$|E
