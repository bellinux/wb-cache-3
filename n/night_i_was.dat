In {{a second}} interview with E4, Lister stated: [...] "I was really surprised when I learned about Zoe's 'master plan' to get Lydia to confess because I think after everything that Zoe's been through [...] the last thing she wants to do is ever see Lydia again, let alone try and make friends with her! But that is her only way, so I think it's really interesting." [...] She continued: [...] "The fight and the chase stuff with Lydia in the graveyard was really good, we filmed it at <b>night.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> dressed as Madonna. We were in a cemetery, it was brilliant!..." ...|$|E
500|$|During live performances, the Beatles {{continued}} the Starr Time routine {{that had been}} popular among his fans: Lennon would place a microphone in front of Starr's kit in preparation for his spotlight moment and audiences would erupt in screams. When the Beatles made their film debut in A Hard Day's Night, Starr garnered much praise from critics, who considered both his delivery of deadpan one-liners and his non-speaking scenes highlights of the movie. The extended non-speaking sequences had to be arranged by director Richard Lester because of Starr's lack of sleep the previous night, Starr commented: [...] "Because I'd been drinking all <b>night</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> incapable of saying a line." [...] Epstein attributed Starr's acclaim to [...] "the little man's quaintness". After {{the release of the}} Beatles' second feature film, Help! (1965), Starr won a Melody Maker poll against his fellow Beatles for his performance as the central character in the film.|$|E

500|$|As a teenager, Cruz became {{interested}} in acting after seeing the film Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990) by Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar. She did casting calls for an agent but was rejected multiple times because the agent {{felt that she was}} too young. Cruz commented on the experience, [...] "I was very extroverted as a kid.... I was studying when I was in high school at <b>night,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in ballet and I was doing castings. I looked for an agent and she sent me away three times because I was a little girl but I kept coming back. I'm still with her after all these years." [...] In 1989, at the age of 15, Cruz won an audition at a talent agency over more than 300 other girls. In 1999, Katrina Bayonas, Cruz's agent, commented, [...] "She was absolutely magic [...] It was obvious there was something very impressive about this kid.... She was very green, but there was a presence. There was just something coming from within." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1958 he {{was second}} {{in the league in}} both wins (17) and ERA (2.68); his seventh two-hitter, a 1–0 win on June 21 against the Baltimore Orioles in which the White Sox scored only an unearned run in the first inning, was {{followed}} by the greatest game of his career. On June 27 against the Senators, he retired the first 26 batters before pinch hitter Ed Fitz Gerald lined Pierce's first pitch down the first base line for an opposite-field double that landed about a foot from the foul line. Pierce then struck out Albie Pearson on three pitches to end the game; only twice did he go to a three-ball count. The lone hit marred what would have been a remarkable accomplishment; not only had no left-hander pitched a perfect game since Lee Richmond in 1880, but only one AL left-hander (Mel Parnell in 1956) pitched even a no-hitter between 1931 and 1962. Although disappointed by the near miss, Pierce praised his teammates for their defensive work, saying, [...] "Give Luis plenty of credit. And Sherm really mixed 'em up beautifully. The big thing is that we won." [...] At a Capitol lunch with several White Sox players during the following year's pennant race, Vice President Richard Nixon told Pierce that he had watched the game on television, saying, [...] "I'm a Washington fan, but that was one <b>night</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> rooting for the White Sox." [...] In a 1982 interview, Pierce said, [...] "The book on Fitz Gerald was that he was a fastball hitter on the first ball and liked it inside where he could pull it. So we threw him a curve away and he hit into right for a solid hit. I didn't feel that badly about it, really. It didn't mean that much at the moment. But now ... well, now I wish I had got it. It would have been nice." [...] His streak of 33 consecutive scoreless innings was ended with an unearned run in the seventh inning on July 1.|$|E

After two singles that failed to make much impression, his career took off when [...] "Hurricane Hattie" [...] became a hit, while he was aged 14. It was produced by Kong, with whom Cliff remained until Kong's death from a heart attack in 1971.|$|E

2500|$|According to Packard, {{the core}} {{idea for the}} series emerged from bedtime stories that he told to his daughters, {{revolving}} around a character named Pete and his adventures. Packard stated, [...] "I had a character named Pete and I usually had him encountering all these different adventures on an isolated island. But that <b>night</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> running out of things for Pete to do, so I just asked what they would do." [...] His two daughters came up with different paths for the story to take and Packard thought up an ending {{for each of the}} paths. [...] "What really struck me was the natural enthusiasm they had for the idea. And I thought: 'Could I write this down?'" ...|$|E

I was summoned to the Cabinet Office, twelve men sitting around a polished table, where it was explained to me why [...] was not being released and we appeal to you as an English gentleman not to release [...]" [...] Irving cooperated and withdrew the chapter, but by this time he had copied enough material from Cherwell's archive to furnish several more books. ULTRA remained secret for another decade.|$|E
2500|$|When Romanian Premier Alexandru Marghiloman {{traveled}} to Bessarabia to canvass for the unionist cause, {{he found the}} Peasant Faction divided between followers of Ion Inculeț, who endorsed the Romanian viewpoint, and deputies who sided with Tsyganko. Zamfirescu, who traveled with Marghiloman, recalls that Tsyganko [...] "thrice in one month" [...] attempted to recall the Republic's Directorate, his moves resisted by Inculeț. He also protested the selection of pro-Romanian students from Kiev and Odessa as representatives of the Transnistrian Moldavians, in which he saw efforts to shake {{the balance of power}} inside the Sfatul. Zamfirescu claims to have saved Tsyganko from an undisclosed mortal danger, and then to have conversed with him, trying to gain insight into his political motivations. The latter, he concluded, were [...] "most phantasmagorical socialist ideas", not dissuaded by the prospect of [...] "death, suffering, military disaster, sheer destitution, or degeneracy". He adds: [...] "It was late at <b>night,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> experiencing chills, and so I believe I have insulted the convictions of this visionary youth, reassuring him that all opinions lead to a ministerial chair, provided one makes sure to discard them on cue." ...|$|E

2500|$|Michael Morpurgo, {{the author}} of the book on which the film is based, visited the set several times while filming was being undertaken: [...] "Spielberg’s a {{wonderful}} storyteller and a kid. He adores stories and that’s what he’s best at. It’s extraordinary to meet someone with that kind of enthusiasm, utterly unspoiled ... When I went to visit him on set, he was clearly enthralled by the countryside. He fell for Devon in a big way. He was warm, kind and open, and utterly without ego ... Spielberg was like a conductor with a very light baton. He hardly had to wave it at all. I was in awe.” Emily Watson also praised Spielberg's approach: [...] "It was intimate, passionate and about the acting. And every single priority that as an actor that you would want to be there was there. It felt very real and focused." [...] On set, he'd come in, in the morning, and say, 'I couldn't sleep last <b>night.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> worrying about this shot!' Which was great! He's human and he's still working in an impassioned way, like a 21-year-old, trying to make the best out of everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Snow Patrol's frontman, Gary Lightbody, {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} writing [...] "Run" [...] in 2000. In an interview with Michael Odell, from Q magazine, Lightbody explained the song was not written about [...] "being a child", as he tended to say. He described: [...] "I was on a massive bender and one <b>night</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> drinking in the bar of the Glasgow School of Art. I fell down a full flight of stairs. Jonny Quinn found me in the stairwell with blood {{coming out of my}} head ... I split my head open and my eye was closed and I lost a few teeth ... I wrote Run soon after on this little guitar I'd tried to smash up in my shitty little room near Hillhead. The words 'Light up, light up' gave me this sense of a beacon." [...] In an interview with Daily Mail in 2009, Lightbody added: [...] "We had nothing. I was in a flat in Glasgow. No doubt it was raining. The song was me writing about an imagined world, projecting myself into better times." [...] Beside Lightbody, it was written by Quinn, Nathan Connolly, Mark McClelland and Iain Archer.|$|E
2500|$|... "In one {{championship}} with Crispa, walo lang kami (there {{were only}} eight of us), some were even fetched from the hospital. In those days, when your team only had seven players, you automatically lose by default. That {{was the fifth}} game, against Toyota. I didn't play the previous game but that <b>night,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a starter. In my entire basketball career, I never practiced as a point guard. Even in that particular game, Baby (Dalupan) did not tell me that I was starting as a point guard. He just sent me out there. In the previous game, I noticed that Hubalde was playing forward. When he attracted a double-team, he'd swing the ball but {{the man at the}} top of the key couldn't deliver. Atoy Co couldn't get the ball because he was also well-covered. So the next game, the whole evening I was the point guard. We won the championship. I dominated the game. It was my show the whole evening. That's the kind of talent Baby has. Baby has some moves that would just change the face or the tempo of the game. I don't know where he got those ideas. Whoever thought I would be playing as a point guard?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Khan {{entered the}} García fight as a heavy {{favourite}} {{and through the}} first two rounds and most of the third he outlanded García while García was finding the range. However, the tide turned against Khan very late in the third round as García was able to land a hard counterpunch off a missed right. Khan hit the canvas and suddenly had to fight to stay alive as García's punch to the neck and jaw badly hurt him. Only the bell saved Khan from a second knockdown and García kept pressing early in round four, forcing Khan to take a second standing eight count after he touched the canvas with his glove. Khan regrouped and was temporarily able to go back at García, but with less than a minute left in the round Khan was dropped a third time. Referee Kenny Bayless stopped the fight despite Khan assuring him he could continue, deciding enough was enough. After the fight, Khan said, [...] "It wasn't my <b>night.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> coming in with my hands down and Danny took advantage of that. He countered very well against me." [...] According to CompuBox stats, Khan landed 92 of 206 punches thrown (45%), with 46 jabs and 46 power shots landed. García landed 65 of his 216 thrown (30%), 60 of which were power shots. Khan earned $950,000, while García had a $520,000 purse. Nevada State Athletic Commission announced the fight generated a total gate of $426,152 from 3,147 tickets sold. The fight averaged 1.3 million viewers on HBO World Championship Boxing.|$|E
2500|$|That night, Louis Martin and his daughters, Léonie, Céline and Thérèse, {{attended}} the midnight mass at the cathedral in Lisieux— [...] "but {{there was very}} little heart left in them. On 1 December, Léonie, covered in eczema and hiding her hair under a short mantilla, had returned to Les Buissonnets after just seven weeks of the Poor Clares regime in Alençon", and her sisters were helping her get over her sense of failure and humiliation. Back at Les Buissonnets as every year, Thérèse [...] "as was the custom for French children, had left her shoes on the hearth, empty in anticipation of gifts, not from Father Christmas but from the Child Jesus, who was imagined to travel through the air bearing toys and cakes." [...] While she and Celine were going up the stairs she heard her father, [...] "perhaps exhausted by the hour, or this reminder of the relentless emotional demands of his weepy youngest daughter", say with some irritation [...] "Therese is far too old for this now. Fortunately this will be the last year!" [...] Thérèse had begun to cry and Céline advised her not to go back downstairs immediately. Then, suddenly, Thérèse pulled herself together and wiped her tears. She ran down the stairs, knelt by the fireplace and unwrapped her surprises as jubilantly as ever. In her account, nine years later, of 1895 : [...] "In an instant Jesus, content with my good will, accomplished the work I {{had not been able to}} do in ten years." [...] After nine sad years she had [...] "recovered the strength of soul she had lost" [...] when her mother died and, she said, [...] "she was to retain it forever". She discovered the joy in self-forgetfulness and added, [...] "I felt, in a word, charity enter my heart, the need to forget myself to make others happy—Since this blessed <b>night</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not defeated in any battle, but instead I went from victory to victory and began, so to speak, [...] "to run a giant's course" [...] (Psalms [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|In June 1918, McKenzie sought {{approval}} from the trustees to raise revenue by using Fisk's campus as a receiving station for Black troops in the Student Army Training Corps (SATC), a precursor to the present-day Reserve Officers' Training Corp (ROTC) program. The Student Army Training Corp allowed students to attend school while they participated in military training exercises during World War I. McKenzie noted that accommodating the troops, [...] "will cramp us very considerably, but the compensation will keep us from any additional indebtedness and probably turn our lodging and boarding department into a self-supporting institution, and enable us to make a number of necessary changes or improvements without cutting into our normal funds. I am glad, too, to be of very direct service to the nation in its persecution of the War." [...] In August 1918, the first of over 600 Black SATC cadets arrived in Nashville. [...] "The boys will live a highly educational military life, centered about Bennett Hall. The girls will live an equally efficient, busy school life, centered about Jubilee Hall," [...] he stated. However the presence of military cadets on Fisk's campus, {{all of whom were}} young men, added to the University's disciplinary problems. While McKenzie appreciated the disciplinary focus of the military's proscribed daily routine, he harshly criticized the military's refusal to acknowledge and abide by Fisk's rules and regulations. At the opening of the 1918 academic year, McKenzie set the tone for a new approach to student conduct by invoking the military's presence and influence on the campus, [...] "We are a military institution. Not that we have been absorbed by the military, but that the essential principles of efficiency exemplified in the military have been absorbed into the university. These principles include concentration of effort, unremitting toil, elimination of all unnecessary activities and motions, regular and insistent schedule of life, promptness, accuracy, reliability thoroughness, instant and complete obedience. With military leaders unwilling to enforce [...] "satisfactory moral standards," [...] their cadets ran rampant, smoking, cursing, and fraternizing with Fisk co-eds. In one significant infraction, a soldier helped a female Fisk student to [...] "escape supervision" [...] of the University and was found with her in a private room. Although the man was arrested, the military administered no punishment. In addition to the poor behavior of cadets, McKenzie strongly criticized the federal government for failing to provide Black soldiers adequate compensation for their service to the nation. [...] "When the immediate aim of efficient fighters was no longer its aim, the Government sought to free itself from its financial obligations and forgot what havoc it would work in the lives of many, many young men," [...] McKenzie lamented in the Fisk News. While the mobilization effort only lasted a few months and World War I ended in November 1918, the military presence had lasting effects on Fisk's campus school discipline. McKenzie continued to experiment the military's model of conduct, but the continued military discipline for student conduct policies after the military's departure from campus angered Fisk students. Viewing the new policies as infringing on their rights, several Fisk students rebelled. McKenzie reported, [...] "The other day the college boys served notice on me that until I was inclined to treat them like men they would refuse to attend the study hall. It did not take very many hours to secure written pledges from all but five of them that they would attend. Since then, one or more of them have attempted to spoil the lights in the study hall, and they have torn down the picture of President Cravath and written an ugly message on the chapel wall where the picture was. McKenzie noted the required study hall also angered certain Fisk alumni, remarking [...] "Only last <b>night</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sent almost direct word to the effect that the alumni would protest against the study hall, and a reminder of the fact that practically no white man is trusted by any Negro." ...|$|E
