25|$|Many of the {{alkaloids}} {{and other}} derivatives of the opium poppy are not opioids or narcotics; {{the best example}} is the smooth-muscle relaxant papaverine. <b>Noscapine</b> is a marginal case as it does have CNS effects but not necessarily similar to morphine, and it is probably in a category all its own.|$|E
25|$|Natural opiates: {{alkaloids}} {{contained in}} the resin of the opium poppy, primarily morphine, codeine, and thebaine, but not papaverine and <b>noscapine</b> which have a different mechanism of action; The following could be considered natural opiates: The leaves from Mitragyna speciosa (also known as kratom) contain a few naturally-occurring opioids, active via Mu- and Delta receptors. Salvinorin A, found naturally in the Salvia divinorum plant, is a kappa-opioid receptor agonist.|$|E
25|$|In Sweden {{preparations}} of codeine {{are sold}} by prescription only. It is sold as pure codeine pills of 25mg in bottles of 100 pills approved {{for treatment of}} pain and cough. In combination tablets and suppositories, most commonly Paracetamol, ibuprofen and acetylsalicylic acid for pain. It is also available as parenteral solution in combination with morphine, papaverin, methylscopolamine and <b>noscapine,</b> approved for treatment against pain in gastrointestinal tract and urogenital tract. Most commonly used against pain from stones.|$|E
25|$|Opium {{contains}} two main groups of alkaloids. Phenanthrenes such as morphine, codeine, and thebaine {{are the main}} psychoactive constituents. Isoquinolines such as papaverine and <b>noscapine</b> have no significant central nervous system effects, and are not regulated under the Controlled Substances Act. Morphine is the most prevalent and important alkaloid in opium, consisting of 10–16 percent of the total, and is {{responsible for most of}} its harmful effects such as lung edema, respiratory difficulties, coma, or cardiac or respiratory collapse. Morphine binds to and activates mu opioid receptor in the brain, spinal cord, stomach and intestine. Regular use can lead to drug tolerance or physical dependence. Chronic opium addicts in 1906 China or modern-day Iran consume an average of eight grams of opium daily.|$|E
25|$|Lavoisier showed {{at the end}} of the 18th {{century that}} organic {{substances}} consisted of a limited number of elements: primarily carbon and hydrogen and supplemented by oxygen and nitrogen. He went quickly focus on the isolation of these substances, often because they had an interesting pharmacological activity. Plants were the main source of such compounds, especially alkaloids and glycosides. It was long been known that opium, a sticky mixture of alkaloids (including codeine, morphine, <b>noscapine,</b> thebaine, and papaverine) from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum), possessed a narcotic and at the same time mind-altering properties. Already in 1805 was morphine isolated by the German chemist Friedrich Sertürner and in the 1870s it was discovered that boiling morphine with acetic anhydride produced a substance with a strong pain suppressive effect: heroin. In 1815, Eugène Chevreul isolated from animal tissue cholesterol, a crystalline substance that belongs to the class of steroids, and in 1820 was strychnine, an alkaloid was isolated.|$|E
25|$|Poppy {{seeds are}} a common and flavorsome topping for breads and cakes. One gram of poppy seeds {{contains}} up to 33 micrograms of morphine and 14 micrograms of codeine, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in the United States formerly mandated that all drug screening laboratories use a standard cutoff of 300 nanograms per milliliter in urine samples. A single poppy seed roll (0.76grams of seeds) usually did not produce a positive drug test, but a positive result was observed from eating two rolls. A slice of poppy seed cake containing nearly five grams of seeds per slice produced positive results for 24 hours. Such results are viewed as false positive indications of drug use and were {{the basis of a}} legal defense. On November 30, 1998, the standard cutoff was increased to 2000 nanograms (two micrograms) per milliliter. Confirmation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry will distinguish amongst opium and variants including poppy seeds, heroin, and morphine and codeine pharmaceuticals by measuring the morphine:codeine ratio and looking for the presence of <b>noscapine</b> and acetylcodeine, the latter of which is only found in illicitly produced heroin, and heroin metabolites such as 6-monoacetylmorphine.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, opium {{tincture}} is marketed {{and distributed}} by several pharmaceutical firms, each producing a single {{formulation of the}} drug, which is deodorized. [...] Each mL contains 10mg of anhydrous morphine (the equivalent of 100mg of powdered opium), other opium alkaloids (except <b>noscapine),</b> and ethanol, 19%. [...] It is available prepackaged in bottles of four ounces (118 mL) and 16 ounces (1 pint or 473 mL).|$|E
2500|$|Laudanum {{is known}} as a [...] "whole opium" [...] {{preparation}} since it historically contained all the opium alkaloids. [...] Today, however, the drug is often processed to remove all or most of the <b>noscapine</b> (also called narcotine) present as this is a strong emetic and does not add appreciably to the analgesic or anti-propulsive properties of opium; the resulting solution is called Denarcotized Tincture of Opium or Deodorized Tincture of Opium (DTO).|$|E
2500|$|Most modern {{formulations}} of opium tincture {{do not contain}} the alkaloid narcotine (also known as <b>noscapine),</b> which has antitussive properties. [...] Even modest doses of narcotine can induce profound nausea and vomiting. Since opium tincture is usually prescribed for its antidiarrheal and analgesic properties (rather than as an antitussive), opium tincture without narcotine is generally preferred. [...] This [...] "de-narcotized" [...] or [...] "deodorized" [...] opium tincture is formulated using a petroleum distillate to remove the narcotine.|$|E
2500|$|Opium poppies {{are popular}} and {{attractive}} garden plants, whose flowers vary greatly in color, size and form. A modest amount of domestic cultivation in private gardens {{is not usually}} subject to legal controls. In part, this tolerance reflects variation in addictive potency. A cultivar for opium production, Papaver somniferum L. elite, contains 91.2 percent morphine, codeine, and thebaine in its latex alkaloids, whereas in the latex of the condiment cultivar [...] "Marianne", these three alkaloids total only 14.0 percent. The remaining alkaloids in the latter cultivar are primarily narcotoline and <b>noscapine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Opium (poppy tears, {{with the}} {{scientific}} name: Lachryma papaveris) is the dried latex {{obtained from the}} opium poppy (scientific name: Papaver somniferum). Opium latex contains approximately 12 percent of the analgesic alkaloid morphine, which is processed chemically to produce heroin and other synthetic opioids for medicinal use and for illegal drug trade. The latex also contains the closely related opiates codeine and thebaine, and non-analgesic alkaloids such as papaverine and <b>noscapine.</b> The traditional, labor-intensive method of obtaining the latex is to scratch ("score") the immature seed pods (fruits) by hand; the latex leaks out and dries to a sticky yellowish residue that is later scraped off and dehydrated. The word [...] "meconium" [...] (derived from the Greek for [...] "opium-like", but now {{used to refer to}} infant stools) historically referred to related, weaker preparations made {{from other parts of the}} opium poppy or different species of poppies.|$|E
2500|$|Globally, opium has {{gradually}} been superseded {{by a variety}} of purified, semi-synthetic, and synthetic opioids with progressively stronger effects, and by other general anesthetics. This process began in 1804, when Friedrich Wilhelm Adam Sertürner first isolated morphine from the opium poppy. The process continued until 1817, when Sertürner published the isolation of pure morphine from opium after at least thirteen years of research and a nearly disastrous trial on himself and three boys. The great advantage of purified morphine was that a patient could be treated with a known dose—whereas with raw plant material, as Gabriel Fallopius once lamented, [...] "if soporifics are weak they do not help; if they are strong they are exceedingly dangerous." [...] Morphine was the first pharmaceutical isolated from a natural product, and this success encouraged the isolation of other alkaloids: by 1820, isolations of <b>noscapine,</b> strychnine, veratrine, colchicine, caffeine, and quinine were reported. Morphine sales began in 1827, by Heinrich Emanuel Merck of Darmstadt, and helped him expand his family pharmacy into the Merck KGaA pharmaceutical company.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1993, papaveretum also {{contained}} <b>noscapine,</b> though this component {{was removed from}} the BP formulation due to the genotoxic potential of <b>noscapine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Noscapine</b> {{is often}} used as an {{antitussive}} medication. A 2012 Dutch guideline, however, does not recommend its use for coughing. <b>Noscapine</b> also has anti-cancer properties, inhibiting microtubule interactions, thereby stopping cell proliferation.|$|E
50|$|Narcotoline is an opiate {{alkaloid}} chemically {{related to}} <b>noscapine.</b> It binds {{to the same}} {{receptors in the brain}} as <b>noscapine</b> to act as an antitussive, and has also been used in tissue culture media.|$|E
50|$|<b>Noscapine</b> {{can survive}} the {{manufacturing}} processes of heroin {{and can be}} found in street heroin. This is useful for law enforcement agencies, as the amounts of contaminants can identify the source of seized drugs. In 2005 in Liège, Belgium, the average <b>noscapine</b> concentration was around 8%.|$|E
5000|$|Noscapine's {{antitussive}} effects {{appear to}} be primarily mediated by its σ-receptor agonist activity. Evidence for this mechanism is suggested by experimental evidence in rats. Pretreatment with rimcazole, a σ-specific antagonist, causes a dose-dependent reduction in antitussive activity of <b>noscapine.</b> <b>Noscapine,</b> and its synthetic derivatives called noscapinoids, are known to interact with microtubules and inhibit cancer cell proliferation ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Noscapine</b> {{has also}} been used to {{identify}} drug users who are taking street heroin {{at the same time}} as prescribed diamorphine. [...] Since the diamorphine in street heroin is the same as the pharmaceutical diamorphine, examination of the contaminants is the only way to test whether street heroin has been used. Other contaminants used in urine samples alongside <b>noscapine</b> include papaverine and acetylcodeine. <b>Noscapine</b> is metabolised by the body, and is itself rarely found in urine, instead being present as the primary metabolites, cotarnine and meconine. Detection is performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) but can also use a variety of other analytical techniques.|$|E
50|$|<b>Noscapine</b> can {{increase}} the effects of centrally sedating substances such as alcohol and hypnotics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Noscapine</b> {{should not}} be taken in {{conjunction}} with warfarin as the anticoagulant effects of warfarin may be increased.|$|E
5000|$|Antitussives, or cough suppressants, are {{substances}} which {{suppress the}} coughing itself. Examples are codeine, pholcodine, dextromethorphan, <b>noscapine,</b> and butamirate.|$|E
5000|$|Many of the enzymes in the <b>noscapine</b> biosynthetic pathway was elucidated by the {{discovery}} of a 10 gene [...] "operon-like cluster" [...] named HN1. In 2016, the biosynthetic pathway of <b>noscapine</b> was reconstituted in yeast cells, allowing the drug to be synthesised. Although produced at low yields, it is hoped this technology could be used in the future as a way of decreasing a drug's production cost, making it more widely available.|$|E
5000|$|... 1-Benzylisoquinoline is a {{chemical}} compound, and the structural backbone of many alkaloids {{with a wide}} variety of structures, including papaverine, <b>noscapine,</b> codeine, morphine, apomorphine, berberine, protopine, tubocurarine, and sanguinarine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Noscapine</b> (also {{known as}} Narcotine, Nectodon, Nospen, Anarcotine and (archaic) Opiane) is a benzylisoquinoline {{alkaloid}} from plants of the poppy family, without painkilling properties. This agent is primarily used for its antitussive (cough-suppressing) effects.|$|E
50|$|Papaverine is {{also present}} in {{combinations}} of opium alkaloid salts such as papaveretum (Omnopon, Pantopon) and others, along with morphine, codeine, {{and in some cases}} <b>noscapine</b> and others in a percentage similar to that in opium, or modified for a given application.|$|E
50|$|There are anecdotal {{reports of}} the {{recreational}} use of over-the-counter drugs in several countries, being readily available from local pharmacies without a prescription. The effects, beginning around 45 to 120 minutes after consumption, are similar to dextromethorphan and alcohol intoxication. Unlike dextromethorphan, <b>noscapine</b> is not an NMDA receptor antagonist.|$|E
50|$|<b>Noscapine</b> is {{currently}} being investigated as an antitumor agent in animal models of several human cancers. At very high doses it may cause polyploidy in animal cells by interfering with the spindles; at low doses - those relevant to medical use {{there seems to be}} a cut off and so it would be safe as used.|$|E
50|$|Side effects {{increase}} with dosage and include drowsiness, mild stomach ache, lethargy, urinary retention, bradypnea, constipation, and nausea. Nausea {{can be attributed}} to the presence of <b>noscapine</b> and is more common in first-time or inexperienced users. At high doses, the side effects are dangerous and can cause death through respiratory arrest or inhalation of vomit. Constipation often results from use (as with any opiate).|$|E

50|$|The lactone ring is {{unstable}} and opens in basic media. The opposite reaction {{is presented in}} acidic media. The bond (C1−C3′) connecting the two optically active carbon atoms is also unstable. In aqueous solution of sulfuric acid and heating it dissociates into cotarnine (4-methoxy-6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1,3dioxolo4,5-gisoquinoline) and opic acid (6-formyl-2,3-dimethoxybenzoic acid). When <b>noscapine</b> is reduced with zinc/HCl, the bond C1−C3′ saturates and the molecule dissociates into hydrocotarnine (2-hydroxycotarnine) and meconine (6,7-dimethoxyisobenzofuran-1(3H)-one).|$|E
