40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{implications}} of different adjustment mechanisms for shadow pricing traded and nontraded goods in a flexible price model. A foreign exchange equivalent rule that can be readily adapted whatever the adjustment mechanism is derived. It is shown that traded commodities are always valued at border prices and <b>nontraded</b> <b>commodities</b> can always be shadow priced in terms of changes in production and consumption of traded goods valued at border prices. The role of the shadow exchange rate and the implications for measuring the balance of payments effect when no tax adjustment policy is assumed are also discussed.

40|$|This paper generalizes {{the notion}} of {{mean-variance}} spanning as de- ned in the seminal paper of Huberman & Kandel (1987) in three di- mensions. It is shown how regression techniques {{can be used to}} test for spanning for more general classes of utility functions, in case some as- sets are nontraded, and in case some of the assets are zero-investment securities such as futures contracts. We then implement these tech- niques to test whether a basic set of three international stock indices, the S&P 500, the FAZ (Germany), and the FTSE (UK), span a set of commodity and currency futures contracts. Depending on whether mean-variance, logarithmic, or power utility functions are considered, the hypothesis of spanning can be rejected for most futures contracts considered. If an investor has a position in a <b>nontraded</b> <b>commodity,</b> then the hypothesis of spanning can almost always be rejected for fu- tures contracts on that commodity for all utility functions considered. For currency futures this is only the case for a power utility function that re ects a preference for skewness. Finally, if we explicitly take into account net futures positions of large traders that are known to have predictive power for futures returns, the hypothesis of spanning can be rejected for most futures contracts. ...|$|R
