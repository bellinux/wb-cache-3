As the fort was not in a state for present service, it would not be difficult for the latter to seize upon his prey in open view of the townsmen and bear it off, in contempt of their feeble means of defence. The position of the two ships was favourable to such an enterprise.

60|$|Richard Middlemas very {{naturally}} renewed his {{intimacy with}} his former comrade, and it was from Hillary's conversation, that he had adopted the enthusiasm respecting India, which we have heard him express. It was indeed impossible for a youth, at once inexperienced in the world, and possessed of a most sanguine disposition, to listen without sympathy to the glowing descriptions of Hillary, who, though only a recruiting captain, had all the eloquence of a recruiting sergeant. Palaces rose like mushrooms in his descriptions; groves of lofty trees, and aromatic shrubs unknown to the chilly soils of Europe, were tenanted by every object of the chase, from the royal tiger down to the jackal. The luxuries of a <b>natch,</b> and the peculiar Oriental beauty of the enchantresses who perfumed their voluptuous Eastern domes, {{for the pleasure of}} the haughty English conquerors, were no less attractive than the battles and sieges on which the Captain at other times expatiated. Not a stream did he mention but flowed over sands of gold, and not a palace that was inferior to those of the celebrated Fata Morgana. His descriptions seemed steeped in odours, and his every phrase perfumed in ottar of roses. The interviews at which these descriptions took place, often ended in a bottle of choicer wine than the Swan Inn afforded, with some other appendages of the table, which the Captain, who was a bon-vivant, had procured from Edinburgh. From this good cheer Middlemas was doomed to retire to the homely evening meal of his master, where not all the simple beauties of Menie were able to overcome his disgust at the coarseness of the provisions, or his unwillingness to answer questions concerning the diseases of the wretched peasants who were subjected to his inspection.|$|E

5|$|The Washington State Legislature {{created the}} State Highway Board in 1905 and {{appropriated}} funds to construct—but not maintain—twelve highways in sparsely settled {{areas of the}} state.

Six of these highways were east-west crossings of the Cascades, including one in the corridor currently served by U.S. Route 12—State Road 5, the Cowlitz Pass State Road, climbing east from a point near Salkum via the Cowlitz River, over Cowlitz Pass, and down towards Yakima. A 1907 amendment renamed State Road 5 the Cowlitz-Natches Road, moved the Cascade crossing north to Carlton Pass, and defined the portion east of the pass to follow the Bumping River and Naches River to a point near Naches. East of the mouth of the American River, this replaced part of State Road 1 (North Yakima and <b>Natches</b> State Road), which had been defined in 1897 to cross the Cascades north of Chinook Pass and included in the 1905 appropriations.|$|R

40|$|AbstractCalcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) {{form the}} {{foundation}} of current graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimens. We hypothesized that a CNI-free regimen consisting of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) and brief-course sirolimus would reduce chronic GVHD and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) after reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). Twenty-six patients (median age, 61 years) underwent unmanipulated PBSCT from an 8 / 8 locus-matched donor (matched related donor, n = 17; <b>natched</b> unrelated donor, n = 9). GVHD prophylaxis consisted of PTCy and brief-course sirolimus. Donor engraftment occurred in all patients. The cumulative incidence (CI) of grade II-IV acute GVHD, grade III-IV acute GVHD, and chronic GVHD was 46 %, 15 %, and 31 % respectively. One-year NRM was 4 %. The median time to immunosuppression discontinuation was day + 138. With a median follow-up of 20 months, the estimated 2 -year overall survival was 71 %, estimated disease-free survival was 64 %, and estimated relapse incidence was 32 %. In patients with a lymphoid malignancy (eg, chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin disease), 2 -year disease-free survival was 100 %, {{and there were no}} relapses. Good immune reconstitution was evidenced by low cytomegalovirus reactivation rate of 21 % (4 of 19 at-risk patients). GVHD prophylaxis with PTCy and sirolimus achieves consistent donor engraftment, low rates of chronic GVHD and NRM, and excellent outcomes in recipients of HLA-identical related and unrelated donor allogeneic PBSCT...|$|R
