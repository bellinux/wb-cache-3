The {{purpose of the present}} study is to systematically explore the economic incentives resulting from the taxation of wealth. The first issue is the effects of the property taxes on the relative attractiveness of different assets. An important influence is the incentive to avoid taxation, and it will also be demonstrated that the marginal rate of taxation could be quite large. In addition, the difference in treatment between citizens and foreigners will be investigated, as well as some implications of the irregular nature of the taxes on wealth...|$|R

Some of the severest criticism came from within the scientific community, as prominent researchers castigated scientists for lacking objectivity, for failing to distinguish between science and policy, and for out-right advocacy of policy positions.

Every day routines and interactions of man and woman are things to be elucidated through verse. Due to his close accounts and evaluations, the role of woman in the poem exemplifies the Victorian theory of Separate spheres. This ideology asserts that women and men are naturally predisposed to excel in a specific realm of society or culture. Women were regarded as being given to aspects of the private or domestic sphere which generally entailed caring for the house and children, while men were made for the public sphere which makes it appropriate for them to leave the home for work and <b>civic</b> <b>obligations.</b>|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{develop a}} {{political}} liberal ethics of citizenship that reconciles conflicting religious and <b>civic</b> <b>obligations</b> concerning political participation and deliberation [...] a liberal-democratic ethics of citizenship that {{is compatible with}} religious integrity. I begin by canvassing {{the current state of}} the debate between political liberals and their religious critics, engaging Rawls's Political Liberalism and the various religious objections Nicholas Wolterstorff, Christopher Eberle, Robert George, John Finnis, Paul Weithman, Jeffrey Stout, and Gerald Gaus and Kevin Vallier develop (Chapter One). I then critically evaluate political liberalism's requirements of citizens in light of the religious objections and the religious objections in light of political liberal norms of reciprocity, concluding that some religious citizens have legitimate complaints against citizenship requirements that forbid citizens from offering religious arguments alone in public political discussions (Chapter Two). Next, I propose an alternative set of guidelines for public political discussions in constitutional democracies, the phased account of democratic decision-making, that, I argue, addresses the religious citizens' legitimate complaints without undermining a constitutional democracy's legitimacy or commitment to public justification (Chapter Three). Then, I argue that a religious practice of political engagement I call prophetic witnessing is compatible with the phased account, can serve as a canonical model to guide religious citizens' political participation, and can help religious citizens navigate the substantive conflicts between their religious and <b>civic</b> <b>obligations</b> that remain possible even in a society that follows the phased account (Chapter Four). Finally, I conclude by imagining three different democracies, each adhering to a different set of guidelines for public political discussions, in order to argue for the benefit of adopting norms that balance citizens' obligations to govern themselves legitimately with citizens' ability to integrate their deepest moral and religious commitments and their public, political argument and advocacy.

50|$|The priesthood {{underwent}} {{profound changes}} with the Second Temple. Under the First Temple the priesthood had been {{subordinate to the}} kings, but in the Second Temple, with the monarchy and even the state no longer available, they became independent. The priesthood under the High Priest (a position largely unknown in earlier times) became the governing authority, making the province of Yehud in a sense a theocracy, although {{it seems unlikely that}} it had any more autonomy than was typical of the empire as a whole. In the Hellenistic period the High Priest continued to play a vital role with both cultic and <b>civic</b> <b>obligations,</b> and the office reached its height under the Hasmoneans, who made themselves priest-kings. Both Herod and the Romans severely reduced the importance of the office, appointing and deposing High Priests to suit their purposes.|$|R
40|$|Much of the {{research}} on citizenship and civics education fails to recognise and explore the importance of individual citizenship practices, institutional performance and the patterning of civic culture. This study uses a single site of an urban Tasmanian government secondary school to examine how students understand and practice citizenship, and how the school functions as a civic community. The study identifies factors which act as facilitators to students developing a sense of membership and entitlement, framing their interests, developing understandings, making commitments and attachments to <b>civic</b> <b>obligations</b> and civil society. The study argues that citizenship education be a major focus in the school's curriculum, and for citizenship practices to be modelled at both the individual and institutional level. A model for examining the school as a civic community is developed in the study, through focusing on the school's pedagogical, leadership, cultural, management and governance practices that enhance its civic outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 2 JUN 2015 This article disputes the recent argument of Dimitry Kochenov advocating an ‘EU Citizenship without Duties’. His thesis rests on an untenable form of philosophical anarchism that overlooks {{the role played}} by our political obligations to state structures in securing rights. At best, his argument suggests a ‘thin’ form of EU citizenship that allows European citizens to choose which of the Member States they wish to become morally obliged to. A ‘thicker’ form of EU level citizenship could only arise by creating <b>civic</b> <b>obligations</b> at the EU level, the position he rejects. To the extent certain Court of Justice judgments in this area reflect parallel reasoning to Kochenov's, they too suffer from a similar failure to appreciate the role of civic duties to particular Member States (or, eventually, the EU) in creating and securing the status of citizens as equal rights bearers...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{perspectives}} on survey participation suggest that survey participation {{is a form}} of community involvement, reflecting a sense of <b>civic</b> <b>obligation</b> that also motivates such behavior as voting, serving on juries, and paying taxes. Using data from the Survey of Census Participation (SCP), we investigate this hypothesis with respect to mail response to the 1990 census. We examine such motivating factors as structural and attitudinal measures of alienation as well as more proximal measures of knowledge of and attitudes toward the census and concerns about privacy and confidentiality. We also examine a variety of constraining factors, including literacy, facility with the English language, and available time to complete the form. Using multivariate analysis, we explore the relative effects of these factors on the likelihood of returning the completed census form by mail and discuss the implications of our findings for participation in the census and political participation more generally...|$|R

40|$|When {{school choice}} {{policies}} position {{young people to}} compete with one another to access public educational resources, students stand to experience these policies in not only academic, but also civic dimensions. Young people’s very encounters with competitive school choice policy through their day-to-day schooling constitute a civic experience. This article, then, explores how students who encounter competitive school choice policies come to understand themselves and other youth as citizens. We pursue this line of inquiry through a critically-oriented, qualitative case study conducted with a racially, ethnically, linguistically and socioeconomically diverse group of 36 students undergoing Chicago’s competitive high school admissions process. Our findings strongly suggest that competitive school choice policies position youth to see their fellow citizens (and themselves) as individuals with unequal degrees of civic entitlement and capacity, who must earn their rights, and who have limited <b>civic</b> <b>obligations</b> to others. This article concludes {{with a discussion of}} implications for school choice policy equity, civic learning, and the role of youth as powerful policy actors...|$|R
40|$|Individualised {{reciprocity}} is {{the moral}} bedrock of recent Australian unemployment policies including the Howard Government’s principle of Mutual Obligation. In this paper I explore the function of reciprocity within unemployment policy {{and the politics of}} redistribution. This exploration allows me to extend existing discussions about Mutual Obligation and include a broader analysis of the <b>civic</b> <b>obligations</b> are framed within it. I argue that temporal and conceptual inconsistencies within Mutual Obligation frame unemployed citizens as perpetual recipients with no past and no future. This artificially static representation justifies the enforced obligations found in current unemployed policy. Other citizens are represented as eternal contributors who are already fulfilling their obligations, a conceptualisation that offers little guidance on general civic responsibilities. Consequently, I argue that reciprocity so-conceived is at best only a partial indicator of whether citizens are fulfilling their obligations to the community. I conclude that individualised reciprocity is an unethical basis on which to administer income support policy in Australia...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{citizenship}} is used {{both as a}} synonym of social action when referencing to an active form of citizenship {{as well as to}} indicate a form of <b>civic</b> <b>obligation</b> (formal citizenship). According to these premises, citizenship can be formalized in a large number of activities that contribute to building it in different ways. The aim of the present work is to explore how the concepts of citizenship and being a citizen are co-built by Italian young adults. Two groups of young adults are considered (engaged vs. not engaged). Eighty-nine young adults participants aged 18 – 36 completed a self-administered mixed-method questionnaire. A content and thematic analysis was conducted and a composite representation of citizenship emerged. Results of the present work can clarify the concept of citizenship by exploring how it is cognitively and socially represented in young adults and how this representation changes in engaged and not engaged young adults...|$|R
40|$|While disagreeing {{over the}} reasons why the {{performance}} of <b>civic</b> <b>obligations</b> seems to be declining, conservatives and liberals agree that people need to be reminded of their duties as citizens for this decline to be halted. But do these exhortations work? This paper tests two theories about how people become volunteers. The “normativist” perspective assumes that volunteer behavior flows from socialization into pro-social attitudes; the “social practice” perspective stresses the formative role of practical experiences and social participation. Using a panel study of high school seniors who were reinterviewed in their mid- 20 s and again in their early 30 s, we show that volunteer work undertaken in high school has long-term benefits as does social participation more generally but that socialization into pro-social attitudes has an even stronger influence on volunteering in middle age. The implications of our study are that mandatory community service programs can boost later volunteer efforts but that socialization into appropriate citizenship attitudes is of equal, if not greater, importance...|$|R
40|$|Survey {{research}} has raised concerns over recent declines in political participation (Putnam, 2000). However, there {{has yet to}} be much research examining reasons for this from a narrative, life history perspective. In the current study, we examined intensive interviews of 94 midlife adults from the MacArthur Foundation Study on Successful Midlife Development, for levels of generative concern using the Loyola Generativity Scale, as well as political behaviours, values and beliefs using measures developed by the authors. This exploratory analysis focused on the accounts that men and women gave of political involvement, as well as predictors of these patterns. Generativity was found to be differentially predictive of traditional political engagement in males and females. More speciﬁcally, generativity was found to be predictive of engagement only in women, as mediated through a sense of <b>civic</b> <b>obligation.</b> Differences were also found in how men and women relate to traditional politics, in that women overall had more desire to engage, but felt less a part of the political process than did men. Implications and directions for future research are discussed...|$|R

As for the irreducible residue of undesirable toil, I owe to my friend the late Professor William James this suggestion of a general conscription and a period of public service for everyone, a suggestion which greatly occupied his thoughts during the last years of his life. He was profoundly convinced of the high educational and disciplinary value of universal compulsory military service, and of the need of something more than a sentimental ideal of duty in public life. He would have had the whole population taught in the schools and prepared for this year (or whatever period it had to be) of patient and heroic labour, the men for the mines, the fisheries, the sanitary services, railway routine, the women for hospital, and perhaps educational work, and so forth.
