The published article is copyrighted by the American Society of Civil Engineers {{and can be found}} at: [URL] paper presents the results of a test program whose goal was to better understand the contribution of individual elements to the performance of typical light-frame wood structures during tsunami loading. The intent was to be able to replicate failures in a structural engineering laboratory that were observed during laboratory experiments of hydraulic loading on wood walls at the NEES Tsunami Facility at Oregon State University. The elastic and inelastic response of shear walls, out-of-plane walls, and a full light-frame wood structural system subjected to varying lateral loads were observed using Digital Image Correlation (DIC). DIC provided a non-contact, three-dimensional measurement system that returned displacement results measured at multiple areas of interest on the wall surface. Overall, these experiments show that the elastic stiffness and ultimate capacity of the shear wall is significantly higher at full height compared to intermediate heights on the wall, and the ultimate lateral capacity was higher in comparison to the a full structural system. The results indicate that the out-of-plane wall behaves like a one way slab with limited contribution from adjacent studs in carrying load. The stud to bottom plate connection failures observed during the wave tank tests were successfully reproduced, and indicate that the <b>nailed</b> <b>connection</b> needs to be reinforced to utilize the available capacity of the individual framing members...|$|E
40|$|The {{strength}} of timber structure will slightly reduce due to long service life or constantly sustained under excessive load. Some {{of the structural}} member {{may need to be}} replaced or rectified. This paper presents findings on the half-lap timber joint strengthened using carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP). The selected timber species are from Malaysian tropical timber, namely Kelampayan (SG 7) and Kempas (SG 2). The size of each specimen was 41 x 100 x 600 mm. Six (6) specimens were tested without and with CFRP sheet. Epoxy glue was used as the bonding agent. The behaviour of the specimen was studied through their load-deformation characteristic upon loading and compared to European Yield Model (EYM). Results show that the strengthened specimens performed better than without CFRP. For Kelampayan, the maximum loads for without and with CFRP were 6. 33 kN and 14. 0 kN respectively. The tensile {{strength of}} the <b>nailed</b> <b>connection</b> with CFRP for Kelampayan has been increased by 121 % compared to without CFRP. As for Kempas, the maximum loads for without and with CFRP are 15. 8 kN and 25. 0 kN respectively and the connection strength with CFRP has been increased by 58 % compared to without CFRP. Both Kelampayan and Kempas failure mode have found failed in mode b for the with CFRP sheet while failure in mode c for the without CFRP sheet. Therefore, it is proven that the use of CFRP sheet has significantly increased the tensile strength of half-lap timber nailed joint for the two-selected species...|$|E

The data and models presented in this study satisfy {{a portion of the}} information intensive requirements of service life prediction models and will be used for continued development of these models. This study investigated single-shear mechanical properties of three <b>nailed</b> <b>connection</b> geometries of biodeteriorated aspen oriented strand board (OSB) sheathing and Douglas-fir framing members, typical in light-framed lateral force resisting systems. Mechanical properties of the nailed connections including ultimate and yield strength, stiffness, and energy dissipation were evaluated at increasing levels of deterioration caused by the brown rot fungus, Postia placenta, through monotonic and quasi-static fully-reversed cyclic testing. The OSB sheathing specific gravity was the strongest explanatory variable for the mechanical properties examined and controlled the behavior of the connections at increasing levels of fungal damage. The data suggested that nailed connections in light-framed lateral force resisting systems can tolerate a moderate amount of fungal attack prior to significant loss of connection capacity. The connection yield mode transitioned from nail bending (mode IIIs) to side member crushing (mode Is) as the weight loss of the OSB sheathing approached 30 percent. Nominal design capacity and yield mode of nailed sheathing to framing member connections with fungal deterioration can be estimated using existing yield models for dowel-type connections through evaluation of the dowel bearing strength of the decay-damaged wood materials. Various physical, mechanical, and chemical properties of the OSB sheathing were monitored in a parallel study at increasing levels of fungal deterioration including dowel bearing strength, shear strength, weight loss, and solubility in an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). These properties were strongly correlated with the OSB sheathing specific gravity. Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, in combination with multivariate statistical methods, was used to develop predictive models for weight loss, shear strength, dowel bearing strength, and solubility. The NIR methods showed considerable promise as a field inspection tool based on the accuracy of models developed in this study...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{approach to}} simulate the behaviour of timber shear walls under both static and dynamic loading is proposed. Because the behaviour of timber shear walls hinges on the behaviour of the <b>nail</b> <b>connections,</b> the force-displacement behaviour of sheathing-to-framing <b>nail</b> <b>connections</b> are first determined and then used to define the hysteretic properties of finite elements representing these <b>connections.</b> The model <b>nails</b> are subsequently implemented into model walls.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to experimentally and analytically investigate the behavior of existing rehabilitated floor and roof wood diaphragms under in-plane lateral loads. The study focused on wood diaphragms characteristic of pre- 1950 ???s unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings found in the central and eastern regions of the United States. Three diaphragm experimental specimens were built, tested, retrofitted and retested again under quasi-static reversed cyclic loading. The specimens differed in the type of sheathing, nailing pattern and the framing orientation with respect to the loading. One specimen represented a floor diaphragm, while the other two were more typical roof diaphragms, with one having a corner opening. A total of four retrofit methods were used on the specimens: (1) steel perimeter strapping and enhanced bolted connections; (2) a steel truss with enhanced bolted connections; (3) an unblocked plywood overlay and (4) a blocked plywood overlay. The in-plane lateral responses measured for the diaphragms were used to develop backbone curves, which were compared with those given in the FEMA 273 and FEMA 356 guidelines for seismic rehabilitation and some differences were found. An analytical study of the diaphragm specimens was undertaken using twodimensional finite element models. Inelastic quasi-static analyses were used to calibrate <b>nailed</b> <b>connection</b> slip behavior, which involves selecting hysteretic parameters for strength deterioration, stiffness degradation and pinching, to correlate with the experimentally measured diaphragm behavior under lateral loads. The analysis was extended to predict the lateral in-plane response for unretrofitted and retrofitted diaphragms of varying aspect ratios. The experimental testing showed that all the retrofit methods provided an increase in strength and stiffness in varying degrees. The steel truss provided the most significant increase in strength and stiffness, followed by the blocked plywood overlay. The analytical data indicated that the FEMA 273 guidelines underpredict yield shear strength and overpredict stiffness, while the FEMA 356 guidelines underpredict the yield shear strength and stiffness of the diaphragm response. The results of the experimental and analytical studies were used to develop a proposed change to some of the parameters used to construct backbone curves for similar wood diaphragms according to the FEMA 356 guidelines.

40|$|Deliberate and {{accidental}} explosions {{along with}} the heightened risk of loss of life and property damage during such events have highlighted the need for research in the behaviour of materials under high strain rates. Where an extensive body of research is available on steel and concrete structures, little to no details on how to address the design or retrofitting of wood structures subjected to a blast threat are available. Studies {{reported in the literature}} that focused on full scale light-frame wood structures did not quantify the increase in capacity due to the dynamic loading while the studies that did quantify the increase mostly stems from small clear specimens that are not representative of the behaviour of structural size members with defects. Tests on larger-scale specimens have mostly focused on the material properties and not the structural behaviour of subsystems. Advancements in design and construction techniques have greatly contributed to the emergence of taller and safer wood structures which increase potential for blast threat. This thesis presents results on the flexural behaviour of light-frame wood stud walls subjected to shock wave loading using the University of Ottawa shock tube. The emphasis is on the overall behaviour of the wall subsystem, especially the interaction between the sheathing and the studs through the <b>nailed</b> <b>connection.</b> The approach employed in this experimental program was holistic, where the specimens were investigated at the component and the subsystem levels. Twenty walls consisting of 38 mm x 140 mm machine stress-rated (MSR) studs spaced 406 mm on center and sheathed with two different types and sheathing thicknesses were tested to failure under static and dynamic loads. The experimental results were used to determine dynamic increase factors (DIFs) and a material predictive model was validated using experimental data. The implications of the code are also discussed and compared to the experimental data. Once validated, an equivalent single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) model incorporating partial composite action was used to evaluate current analysis and design assumptions. The results showed that a shock tube can effectively be used to generate high strain-rate flexural response in wood members and that the material predictive model was found suitable to effectively predict the displacement resulting from shock wave loading. Furthermore, it was found that current analysis and design approaches overestimated the wall displacements...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{aspects of}} the {{installation}} of photovoltaic (PV) modules on existing wood roof framing systems are considered. Often, existing roofs are inadequate to resist even current minimum design loads, much less the extra weight of PV modules. Rather than requiring expensive retrofits, it is desired to bring these under-strength roofs into compliance with current codes by reconsidering composite action, produced by the joist-sheathing interaction of the assembly, on the bending strength of joists. The effect of composite action can be quantified by considering a composite T-beam, with the wood joist being the web and the structural sheathing being the flange. Although this effect has already been considered in the past (under different assumptions and different models), it is hypothesized that an increase in strength can still be achieved even when using a discontinuous flange (due to gaps between sheathing panels), and non-rigid connections like a nailed joint. Laboratory experiments using several 2 ”x 4 ” bare wood joists and 2 ”x 4 ” joists along with 7 / 16 ”-thick OSB panels attached to their tops (using nailed and glued-and-nailed connections) were performed. The experiments showed bending strength increases between 18 to 60 % in T-beams, {{when compared to the}} bending strength of bare joists. Tests also showed that the strength of the T-beam varies {{as a function of the}} random location, with respect to the location of a gap, of a weak knot with lower strength that initiates failure in the joist. The behavior and mechanical properties of the connection are also studied and compared with existing literature. Analytical and finite element analyses of the composite T-beam subjected to constant moment, show nonlinear behavior of the <b>nailed</b> <b>connection</b> when the failure moment is applied to the composite T-beam, hence, developing Nonlinear Partial Composite Action (NPCA). A small decrease in the maximum tensile stress at the bottom of the joist is obtained at sections away from the location of the gap due to NPCA. Also, finite element analysis shows that even at the location of the gap, the tensile stress is slightly reduced due to local effects in the joist produced by the local nail forces. A Monte Carlo simulation is utilized to randomly vary the location of knots along the span of the T-beam and conservatively evaluate the effect that NPCA has in the tensile stress at each knot. Slight increases in the mean bending strength of the joist are predicted, depending upon the 5 % exclusion limit bending strength value for clear wood and the stress grade of the species. However, these predictions of strength increase are small and do not match the 18 to 60 % observed increases in the laboratory experiments. Perhaps the number of laboratory tests was insufficient to produce a statistically significant data set. Finally, generic, easy to install and effective procedures for retrofitting roof joists to enhance the beneficial effects of NPCA are proposed to justify increased roof strength to allow for the loads from the PV modules.

40|$|The {{resistance}} of conventionally constructed wood-framed structures to extreme {{events such as}} earthquakes and hurricanes depends {{in large part on}} the strength and energy absorption characteristics of the shear walls. These shear walls are often sheathed with oriented strand board (OSB) panels, and their performance is primarily a function of the <b>nailed</b> sheathing-to-framing <b>connections</b> at the panel edges. A new sheathing panel called Advanced OSB (AOSB) has been developed at the University of Maine's Advanced Engineered Wood Composites Center. The AOSB panel integrates glass fiberreinforced polymer (GFRP) reinforcing into regions of the OSB panel that have been observed to fail under hurricane or earthquake loading. Structural testing of both single <b>nail</b> <b>connections</b> and full scale shear walls have shown that AOSB has great potential for increasing the energy dissipation capacity and lateral load {{resistance of}} wood-framed structures subjected to extreme wind and seismic events.

This system combines large timber members with unbonded posttensioning for recentering and ductile connections for energy dissipation. This paper describes the experimental, analytical, and numerical investigation of posttensioned laminated veneer lumber (LVL) walls coupled with plywood sheets subjected to both quasi-static cyclic and pseudodynamic seismic testing protocols. Different arrangements of nails, used to connect the plywood coupling panels with the posttensioned timber walls, have been tested to compare their energy dissipation characteristics. Simplified numerical macromodels with rotational spring elements {{have been developed to}} accurately represent the recentering contribution from the posttensioning and the pinched hysteric contribution of the <b>nailed</b> <b>connections.</b> The testing results provided good seismic performance, characterized by negligible damage of the structural members and very small residual deformations following drift levels of 2 - 2. 5 %.

Based on classical laminated plate theory, composite laminates with ± 45 ° laminate alignment patterns produce higher in-plane shear modulus and strength when compared to typical 0 °/ 90 °/ 0 ° laminate alignment. This research consisted of manufacturing 13. 3 mm thick OSB with 0 °/+ 45 °/- 45 °/ 45 °/+ 45 °/ 0 ° and 0 °/ 90 °/ 0 ° alignment patterns and comparing the in-plane shear, bending, <b>nail</b> <b>connection,</b> and small-scale shear wall properties with typical commercial OSB.

40|$|Mechanical timber {{connections}} {{can fail}} both in a brittle and a ductile manner {{depending on the}} joint layout. Plug shear failure in <b>nailed</b> timber <b>connections</b> is a brittle failure mode, which shall be avoided in timber structures. This failure mode occurs in <b>nailed</b> <b>connections</b> loaded in tension parallel to the grain, for instance in the lower chord of a timber truss. The failure mode is not described in the Swedish building code of today, {{but there is an}} informative annex in the upcoming Eurocode 5 concerning the subject. In the thesis, plug shear failure is studied and a new prediction model developed based on experimental work on <b>nailed</b> steel-to-timber <b>connections.</b> The experiments were short-term experiments and the effect of long-term conditions is not considered. The total amount of joints tested was 86, which together with results from other researchers formed the base for the prediction model. The stress state and the effect of fastener placement were analysed and showed that plug shear failure is initiated at the nail farthest from the free end of timber. Increased spacing between fasteners lessens the risk for plug shear failure to occur, especially the spacing perpendicular to the grain is important. The prediction model is based on structural mechanics and suggests that the plug shear resistance R = blfv, where b is the joint width, l the joint length and fv the shear strength of wood. The shear strength is determined through fv = KAs- 0. 25, where As = bl and K is a constant. Furthermore, an analysis based on fracture mechanics was performed showing the importance of the softening behaviour of the joint failure. The overall goal with the development of a prediction model is to avoid brittle failures and promote ductile failures. As a tool to promote ductile failures, a measure was developed to aid the designer in designing ductile and strong joints. Recommendations on nail spacing and overall design of the joint are finally given with the aim to avoid plug shear failure. Godkänd; 2004; 20061030 (haneit...|$|R

A fragility methodology {{was used as a}} tool to probabilistically study the loss of the roof system, and bound an Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale rating of the tornado. The tornado was initially rated as an EF 3 tornado by the U. S. National Weather Service. However, following a detailed site inspection verified with numerical structural models, the tornado was downgraded to an EF 2 tornado. As expected, the use of <b>nail</b> <b>connections</b> in a roof-to-wall connection resulted in a weaker link compared to a hurricane clip. The approach presented in this paper {{can be used as a}} supplement to the EF rating provided by U. S. National Weather Service meteorologists when unusual conditions in either the structure or surroundings exists...|$|R

The objective was {{to provide information about}} simplifying a model of wood-framed shear walls with no significant loss in accuracy. The simplifications concern features such as slips in joints between frame members, slips in hold-down connections, and bearing between adjacent sheathing panels. The results from analyses of a shear wall with an opening of window shape show that the effect of constraint by the bearing between sheathing panels and slips in frame joints on the overall stiffness of the wall is limited. Thus, there are great possibilities for reducing the calculation time by not taking these phenomena into account, avoiding an excessive number of degrees of freedom and iterations. The influence of the simplifications on the distribution of vertical reaction forces along the wall is more significant. Furthermore, if each simplification is introduced separately, the effect on the overall stiffness is greater. The difference, however, is less than 10 %. The failing pattern of the <b>nail</b> <b>connections</b> is also clearly influenced by the simplifications when they are introduced separately. The results from the analyses show that slips in frame joints can be sufficiently represented by those in connection with the opening...|$|R

However, the use of this system is not complemented with adequate research of its strength and behavior. In this study, wooden truss would be examined experimentally. The specimen is a wooden truss joist supporting the floor slab for typical residences with two connection type variations which are nail and glue. These specimens has dimension of 185 cm in length and 36 cm in height with 3 layers of a wooden board in width, and were produced by using Sengon wood with elasticity modulus of 2867 MPa, and specific gravity of 0. 4. Destructive and non-destructive test were performed. From the result, we obtained a higher proportional strength for glue type connection truss which at 1123. 34 kg compared to <b>nail</b> type <b>connection</b> truss which at 767. 07 kg. However, unlike the <b>nail</b> type <b>connection,</b> the glue type connection has a brittle behavior. Moreover, the stiffness connection study resulted with partial fixity value of 0. 07 for nail type and 0. 98 for glue type connection. Furthermore, these results have also been validated using numerical model analysi...|$|R

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{to assess the}} behavior factor of post-and-beam timber structures based on the Capacity Spectrum Method is herein presented {{and the results of}} numerical simulations performed on three different building configurations, two and three storey buildings regular in plan and a two storey building non-regular in plan, are shown. The procedure assumes that the dissipative capacity of the structure is concentrated in the <b>nailed</b> <b>connections</b> of the components, whose non-linear behavior is derived by means of experimental tests. The results obtained, concerning the three types of buildings with three different proportioning criteria for the connections, are compared in terms of force–displacement capacity curves, global ductility, maximum resistant ground acceleration and behavior factor q. The global ductility ranges from 1. 8 to 2. 4. The values of the behavior factor q of the two storey buildings ranges from 2. 4 to 3. 8, depending on the shear redistribution amount among the shear walls; higher values (3. 0 – 4. 4) were obtained for the three storey buildings. Moreover, a nail distribution at each level according to the storey demand increases the dissipative capacity of the structure. The results of the study evidence that the maximum value of the behavior factor allowed in Eurocode 8 for timber structures with nailed shear walls and nailed diaphragms, connected with nails and bolts (q = 5) is in general not possible for post-and-beam timber buildings braced with nailed shear walls...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{theoretical}} and experimental investigations of <b>nailed</b> steel plate <b>connections.</b> For the experimental part, {{a total of}} 43 laboratory tests on connections loaded in tension parallel to the grain are reported. The paper deals also with finite element analysis of the connection, presenting {{a study on the}} 3 D stress distributions within the wood member and a study of the progressive wood fracture course by the use of a 3 D nonlinear fracture mechanics model, more precisely a cohesive zone model. Results of the experimental tests are compared to results of the numerical analyses and to strength predictions according to Eurocode 5. The comparison between theoretical and experimental results indicate that the Eurocode 5 design approach for plug shear failure in <b>nailed</b> steel plate <b>connections</b> might be nonconservative in relation to predicted strength values. Also failure modes predicted by Eurocode 5 are often erroneous. Results of the numerical analyses indicate that load eccentricity has a major influence on the connection strength...|$|R
40|$|Past {{high speed}} wind events have exposed the {{vulnerability}} of the roof systems of existing light-framed wood structures to the uplift forces resulting from high speed winds, contributing greatly to economic and human loss. This research focuses on developing a retrofit system to increase the uplift capacity of these structures using numerical and experimental techniques. The proposed system provides the uplift forces an alternate load path to the ground, reducing the demand placed on the weak, <b>nailed</b> <b>connections</b> within the structure. A three-dimensional finite-element model of a roof system of full-scale wood structure has been developed. The model is compared to the results of a full-scale experiment in both the linear and nonlinear ranges, proving the ability of the model to predict the deflected shape of the structure. The numerical results identify the importance of considering the nonlinear plastic damage that occurs to the roof-to-wall connection under realistic wind loading. The validated numerical model is then extended to include the proposed retrofit idea. A rigorous analysis of the behaviour of the structure after application is then carried out. The model predicts that application of the retrofit system can increase the critical mean hourly wind velocity from 38 m/s to 50 m/s. An experiment has been conducted, proving the retrofit system is effective at increasing the uplift capacity of light-framed wood structures. The results of the experiment have been used to validate the assumptions of the numerical model, proving that the model captures the structural interaction between the retrofit and truss systems...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references: p. 58 - 60. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The goals of this research were {{to gain a better understanding}} of the performance of ring-shank (annularly threaded) <b>nails</b> in lateral <b>connections</b> common to the post-frame industry, and to evaluate the European yield model (EYM), the basis for derivation of allowable design values, for ring-shank nails. Inputs to the EYM include nail bending yield strength, dowel bearing strength, and connection geometry. These parameters as well as single-shear connection strength were determined for nine nail groups tested in Southern Pine lumber. Nail specimens included three suppliers, two shank types (smooth and ringshank), two diameters (3. 76 and 4. 50 mm), and two coatings (galvanized and ungalvanized). Ring-shank nails averaged 85 % higher nail bending yield strength than the common nails for all but two groups. A regression model relating dowel bearing strength to specific gravity was developed based on tests with the nine nail groups loaded parallel-to-grain in Southern Pine. A statistically significant reduction in dowel bearing strength was observed for 4. 50 compared to 3. 76 mm diameter nails. While ring-shank <b>nail</b> <b>connection</b> maximum loads were roughly twice that of common nails for the same diameter, no significant differences were observed for yield loads. The current yield load definition is based on the slope of the initial portion of the load-displacement curve and does not adequately account for increases in connection strength resulting from higher steel quality. As a result, predicted yield loads based on the EYM were significantly higher than observed yield loads. A revised yield load definition is needed which includes yielding predicted by the EYM without including factors extraneous to the model. Ring-shank nails exhibited significantly higher lateral connection strengths than the common nails tested as a result of increased steel strength and gripping action of the threads. Finally, standardization in ringshank nail manufacturing must be instituted to ensure minimum steel and thread quality, before any increase in design values for ring-shank nails is implemented...|$|R
30|$|As a non-wood natural bio-composite, bamboo has {{attracted}} worldwide attention in construction, transportation, stationery commodity and even daily articles {{due to its}} abundant resource, excellent mechanical performances and environmental protection [1]. Based on the better understanding of bamboo structural, physical and mechanical performance [2], bamboo is extremely potential to be utilized as an engineering structure material [3]. However, lack of strong and reliable connection restricts its further application in construction. At present, there are many types of connections used in timber structures in the residential or commercial houses, including <b>nailed</b> <b>connections</b> [4], bolted connections [5], dowel connections [6 – 9] and adhesive bonded steel connection. Epoxy bonded steel connection, which is used in bamboo timbers, is that a threaded steel bar is placed into predrilled holes in timber members and bonded with epoxy resin. The embedded steel bar with the epoxy bonding agent allow a strong connection to be made with increased stiffness of the joint and the structure could be also kept for its excellent esthetic appeal and fire resistance without any cover [10, 11]. So epoxy bonded steel connection has been extensively used in column-base, beam-column and elbow connections [12, 13] {{for quite a long}} time since the first study by Riberholt [14, 15]. There are two different types of the epoxy bonded steel connection classified by the different implant bar number: single bar connecting bar and multitude bar connection. However, there are studies on the epoxy bonded steel connection in bamboo glulam, better analyze the performance of epoxy bonded steel connection into bamboo glulam could explore its utilization [16]. The ratio of depth and diameter of glued-in rods are the main factors influencing pull-out connection strength of timber [17].|$|R
