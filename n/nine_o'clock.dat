5|$|Almost every {{clock is}} set at three or <b>nine</b> <b>o'clock.</b> The point of the clocks was to teach the viewer to view the sundial at the end upside down.|$|E
5|$|The second {{spirit to}} be {{contacted}} {{identified himself as}} Sunex Amures, and claimed that he would {{set fire to the}} rectory at <b>nine</b> <b>o'clock</b> that night, 27 March 1938. He also said that, at that time, the bones of a murdered person would be revealed.|$|E
5|$|Rowan Atkinson and Richard Curtis {{developed}} {{the idea for}} the sitcom while working on Not the <b>Nine</b> <b>O'Clock</b> News. Eager to avoid comparisons to the critically acclaimed Fawlty Towers, they proposed the idea of a historical sitcom. An unaired pilot episode was made in 1982, and a six-episode series was commissioned.|$|E
60|$|It {{was between}} <b>nine</b> and ten <b>o'clock</b> before I reached Fulham, and found {{my way to}} Gower's Walk.|$|R
60|$|As he said this, he {{made some}} {{memorandum}} in his pocket-book in which Mr Mantalini's name figured conspicuously, and finding by his watch that it was between <b>nine</b> and ten <b>o'clock,</b> made all speed home.|$|R
60|$|That {{night it}} fell to Sam's lot to be on guard from <b>nine</b> to ten <b>o'clock.</b> The camp-fire was left burning brightly, and the {{youngest}} Rover sat near it on a log, {{a gun in his}} lap.|$|R
5|$|The Follies of 1919 found Stamper {{branching}} out into writing lyrics {{as well as}} writing comic sketches. 1919 was a very busy year, with Stamper writing songs for the Follies {{as well as the}} Midnight Frolic and the Ziegfeld <b>Nine</b> <b>O'Clock</b> Review both of which appeared in a theater {{on the roof of the}} New Amsterdam theater.|$|E
5|$|That fall, CBS Reports, a news/documentary {{program at}} 7:30(et) on Wednesdays, was blamed {{in the press}} for the sharp drop off in the ratings of The Beverly Hillbillies– the comedy had been number one in its first two seasons, but dropped to eighteenth when CBS Reports became the Hillbillies lead-in for its third season. (Hillbillies had aired at <b>nine</b> <b>o'clock</b> before moving up a half hour in 1964.) CBS responded by moving CBS Reports to Mondays.|$|E
5|$|Production on {{the second}} series was delayed several times. While Adams {{was meant to be}} working on scripts for a stage {{adaptation}} of Hitchhiker's in April 1979, he was also employed as the Script Editor for Doctor Who and turned down an offer from John Lloyd to submit material for Not the <b>Nine</b> <b>O'Clock</b> News. The recording on the first day scheduled for the second radio series, 19 May 1979, was left incomplete because Adams had not yet finished the script. Further scheduled recordings on 11 July and 1 August of that year were also cancelled, this time due in part to Adams trying to work on the LP re-recordings of the first series, as well as its novelisation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello! Is that you, Miller?" [...] Mr. Watling said. [...] "This is Wading. When can I see {{you for a}} {{few minutes}} this evening? Yes, I am leaving for Washington at <b>nine</b> thirty. Eight <b>o'clock.</b> All right, I'll be there." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the last}} {{station on the}} railway the horses were waiting for us. It was a lovely {{moonlight}} night, and we shortened the distance considerably by taking the bridle path over the moor. Between <b>nine</b> and ten <b>o'clock</b> we reached the Abbey.|$|R
60|$|Between <b>nine</b> and ten <b>o'clock</b> that night, Mr. Bashwood {{awoke in}} his bed at the inn in the Borough. He had slept for some hours since he had been brought back from the hospital; and his mind and body were now slowly {{recovering}} together.|$|R
5|$|For Season 17, John Lloyd, a {{frequent}} collaborator with script editor Douglas Adams, adapted material from his unpublished science fiction story GiGax and in October 1978 submitted Shylock, a four-part serial written in Adams' light-hearted style. After providing a second {{draft of the}} storyline to modify parts of the script to avoid {{issues such as the}} rules involving child actors, Lloyd was forced to focus on his commitments as producer of Not the <b>Nine</b> <b>O'Clock</b> News. Williams was still interested enough in the storyline that he made plans to involved writer Allan Prior to work on the scripts. The storyline was commissioned on 7 February 1979 and a script list dated 29 June 1979 links Lloyd and Prior to the project. Lloyd officially agreed to another writer taking on his story on 25 August 1979. In the story, the Doctor is subpoenaed to appear in court when a corporation tries to buy Earth in order to obtain a matter-transmutation device.|$|E
5|$|At <b>nine</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, {{students}} began gathering on the University of Dhaka premises {{in defiance of}} Section 144. The university vice-chancellor and other officials were present as armed police surrounded the campus. By a quarter past eleven, students gathered at the university gate and attempted to break the police line. Police fired tear gas shells towards the gate to warn the students. A section of students ran into the Dhaka Medical College while others rallied towards the university premises cordoned by the police. The vice-chancellor asked police to stop firing and ordered the students to leave the area. However, the police arrested several students for violating section 144 as they attempted to leave. Enraged by the arrests, the students met around the East Bengal Legislative Assembly and blocked the legislators' way, asking them to present their insistence at the assembly. When {{a group of students}} sought to storm into the building, police opened fire and killed a number of students, including Abdus Salam, Rafiq Uddin Ahmed, Abul Barkat and Abdul Jabbar. As the news of the killings spread, disorder erupted across the city. Shops, offices and public transport were shut down and a general strike began. At the assembly, six legislators including Manoranjan Dhar, Boshontokumar Das, Shamsuddin Ahmed and Dhirendranath Datta requested that chief minister Nurul Amin visit wounded students in hospital and that the assembly be adjourned as a sign of mourning. This motion was supported by some treasury bench members including Maulana Abdur Rashid Tarkabagish, Shorfuddin Ahmed, Shamsuddin Ahmed Khondokar and Mosihuddin Ahmed. However, Nurul Amin refused the requests.|$|E
25|$|Another parody {{was in the}} satirical British program Not the <b>Nine</b> <b>O'Clock</b> News, {{portrayed by}} Griff Rhys Jones, showing him as a boy arguing with his parents over breakfast.|$|E
60|$|It {{was between}} <b>nine</b> and ten <b>o'clock</b> when, strolling in a melancholy manner through the town, I stopped at Mr. Omer's door. Mr. Omer {{had taken it}} so much to heart, his {{daughter}} told me, {{that he had been}} very low and poorly all day, and had gone to bed without his pipe.|$|R
50|$|The {{battle was}} carried out by two armies, those of Michael the Brave (Wallachians and Cossacks) {{together}} with Giorgio Basta, on one side and those of Sigismund Báthory on the other side. The battle happened between <b>nine</b> and seven <b>o'clock</b> on 3 August 1601. The Battle of Guruslău took place in the Guruslău River plain.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's chaps in London," [...] {{said a man}} {{across the}} table from me, [...] "that get all the tommy they want, an' they never think o' goin' to the country. Stay in London the year 'round. Nor do they think of lookin' for a kip [place to sleep], till <b>nine</b> or ten <b>o'clock</b> at night." ...|$|R
25|$|Carrington {{was portrayed}} by Rowan Atkinson on Not the <b>Nine</b> <b>O'Clock</b> News in {{a parody of}} Question Time, in which Lord Carrington was portrayed as pedantically {{discussing}} an imminent nuclear holocaust.|$|E
25|$|Angela Rippon {{became the}} first female news {{presenter}} of the <b>Nine</b> <b>O'Clock</b> News in 1975. Her work outside the news was controversial at the time, appearing on The Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show in 1976 singing and dancing.|$|E
25|$|Some {{newspapers}} were criticised for sensationalism and invasion of privacy, but the BBC was criticised by journalists for the opposite: the BBC's evening news programme on the day, the <b>Nine</b> <b>O'Clock</b> News carried {{the story about}} the crash as its third item.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, she'll be {{back again}} between <b>nine</b> and ten <b>o'clock,</b> unless they keep her late," [...] said old Liz, after Sam had {{explained}} who he was, {{and found that}} Susy was indeed his daughter, and chimney-pot Liz the nurse who had tended his wife to her dying day, and afterwards adopted his child.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well! Look {{after him}} for the present, and--let me see--three days from this time let the other woman come here, and we'll {{see if we can}} make a bargain of it. About <b>nine</b> or ten <b>o'clock</b> at night, say. Keep your eye upon him in the meanwhile, and don't talk about it. He's as mad as a March hare!' ...|$|R
60|$|We return {{slowly through}} the city, where we have spent the whole day, from <b>nine</b> till four <b>o'clock.</b> We linger on the way, imploring Ventisei {{if there is not}} {{something}} to be seen in this or that house; we make our weariness an excuse for sitting down, and cannot rend ourselves from the bliss of being in Pompeii.|$|R
25|$|The lessons {{lasted from}} <b>nine</b> <b>o'clock</b> {{in the morning}} to four o'clock in the {{afternoon}} and then he had to return to the farm. There he remembered not having anybody to talk to, as his parents were busy and he had little in common with his brother.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 the UBC Engineers {{were accused}} of hanging another VW Beetle shell off the Lions Gate Bridge {{as well as of}} {{painting}} and disabling the <b>Nine</b> <b>O'clock</b> gun in Stanley Park. Although they have not denied the VW shell hanging, their official statement on the topic insists that the Society was not involved in the vandalism of the gun.|$|E
25|$|The oldest manmade {{landmark}} {{in the park}} is an 1816 naval cannon located near Brockton Point. The <b>Nine</b> <b>O’Clock</b> Gun, {{as it is known}} today, was fired {{for the first time in}} 1898, a tradition that has continued for more than 100 years. The cannon was originally detonated with a stick of dynamite, but is now activated automatically with an electronic trigger.|$|E
60|$|It {{was between}} <b>nine</b> and ten <b>o'clock</b> {{when the driver}} pulled up his horse at last. Midwinter got out, and saw the cab before them waiting at a house door. As soon as he had {{satisfied}} himself that the driver was the man whom Mr. Bashwood had hired, he paid the promised reward, and dismissed his own cab.|$|R
5000|$|The Vicar Thomas Jeffery {{noted the}} {{catastrophe}} {{in the parish}} register: [...] "Memorandum May 16. Between <b>nine</b> and ten <b>o'clock</b> in the forenoon on the Sat. fell down {{the north and south}} sides of the steeple and no person man woman nor child 'yt we hear of yet getting any mischief thereby. Thanks to be to God for his goodness therein." ...|$|R
60|$|Emotions {{would be}} half starved {{if there were}} no candle-light. Probably nine-tenths of the gushing letters of indiscreet {{confession}} are written after <b>nine</b> or ten <b>o'clock</b> in the evening, and sent off before day returns to leer invidiously upon them. Few that remain open to catch our glance as we rise in the morning, survive the frigid criticism of dressing-time.|$|R
25|$|Afternoon {{television}} news bulletins during {{the mid to}} late 1970s were broadcast from the BBC newsroom itself, rather than one of the three news studios. The newsreader would present to camera while {{sitting on the edge of}} a desk; behind him staff would be seen working busily at their desks. This period corresponded with when the <b>Nine</b> <b>O'Clock</b> News got its next makeover, and would use a CSO background of the newsroom from that very same camera each weekday evening.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Connolly's first play, An' Me wi' a Bad Leg, Tae {{opened in}} Irvine and toured in London. It was there that, after {{consuming}} a sizable amount {{of cocaine and}} alcohol, he collapsed {{on the floor of}} a recording studio. In 1979, Connolly met Pamela Stephenson, the New Zealand-born comedy actress, for the first time when he made a cameo appearance on the BBC sketch show Not the <b>Nine</b> <b>O'Clock</b> News, in which she was one of four regular performers.|$|E
25|$|Like the ship's other junior officers, Lowe {{reported}} to White Star's Liverpool offices at <b>nine</b> <b>o'clock</b> {{in the morning}} on 26 March 1912, and travelled to board the Titanic at Belfast the following day. On sailing day (10 April), Lowe assisted (among other things) in the lowering of two of the starboard lifeboats to satisfy the Board of Trade that the Titanic met safety regulations. When the Titanic departed Southampton at noon, Lowe was on the bridge, relaying messages to various parts of the ship by telephone.|$|E
60|$|Thus, I knew once a zealous, pious, {{religious}} tradesman, {{who would}} almost shut up his shop every day about <b>nine</b> or ten <b>o'clock</b> to call all his family together to prayers; {{and yet he}} was no presbyterian, I assure you; I say, he would almost shut up his shop, for he would suffer none of his servants to be absent from his family worship.|$|R
60|$|An {{hour after}} {{we had come to}} this determination, I {{question}} if either of the five knew anything about it. I never slept more profoundly in my life, and my companions subsequently gave the same account of their several conditions. Fatigue, and youth, and health, gave us all refreshing sleep; and, as we lay down at <b>nine,</b> two <b>o'clock</b> came after so much time totally lost in the way of consciousness. I say two o'clock; for my watch told me that was just the hour, when the Indian awoke me, by shaking my shoulder. One gets the habits of watchfulness in the woods, and I was on my feet in an instant.|$|R
25|$|The 5.56mm Conventional Multirole Combat Rifle (CMCR) was {{released}} during the Singapore Airshow 2014. Equipped {{with a unique}} adjustable and foldable buttstock, the CMCR provides ease and comfort for soldiers to manipulate in tight spaces. The CMCR is designed to fire NATO SS109 5.56mm ammunition and ST Kinetics’ Extended Range 5.56mm ammunition, and come standard with MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny Rails at the three, six, <b>nine</b> and 12 <b>o’clock</b> positions.|$|R
