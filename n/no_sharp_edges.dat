The hood, body, fenders, and headlights are integral to the continuously flowing surface, rather than added on. Before the Cisitalia, the prevailing approach followed by automobile designers when defining a volume and shaping the shell was to treat each part of the body as a separate, distinct element—a box to house the passengers, another for the motor, and headlights as appendages. In the Cisitalia, there are <b>no</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>edges.</b> Swellings and depressions maintain the overall flow and unity, creating a sense of speed.|$|E

60|$|Secreting Jewels.--Before {{going to}} a rich but imperfectly civilised country, {{travellers}} sometimes buy jewels and bury them in their flesh. They make a gash, put the jewels in, and allow the flesh to grow over them as it would over a bullet. The operation is more sure to succeed if the jewels are put into a silver tube with rounded ends, for silver does not irritate. If the jewels are buried without the tube, they must have <b>no</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>edges.</b> The best place for burying them is in the left arm, at the spot chosen for vaccination. A traveller who was thus provided would always have a small capital to fall back upon, though robbed of everything he wore.|$|E

But since the permanence of the material justifies exquisiteness of workmanship, whatever delicate ornamentation can be wrought with rounded surfaces may be advisedly introduced; and since the color of bronze or any other metal is not so pleasantly representative of flesh as that of marble, a wise sculptor will depend less on flesh contour, and more on picturesque accessories, which, though they would be vulgar if attempted in stone, are rightly entertaining in bronze or silver. Verrocchio's statue of Colleone at Venice, Cellini's Perseus at Florence, and Ghiberti's gates at Florence, are models of bronze treatment.|$|E
60|$|Now we {{have just}} seen how Turner uses the {{sharp-edged}} cirri when he aims at giving great transparency of air. But it was shown in the preceding chapter that sunbeams, or the appearance of them, are always sharper in their edge in proportion as the air is more misty, as they are most defined in a room where there is most dust flying about in it. Consequently, in the vignette we have been just noticing, where transparency is to be given, {{though there is a}} blaze of light, its beams are never edged; a tendency to rays is visible, but you cannot in any part find a single marked edge of a rising sunbeam, the sky is merely more flushed in one place than another. Now let us see what Turner does when he wants mist. Turn to the Alps at Daybreak, page 193, in the same book. Here we have the cirri used again, but now they have <b>no</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>edges,</b> they are all fleecy and mingling with each other, though every one of them has the most exquisite indication of individual form, and they melt back, not till they are lost in exceeding light, as in the other plate, but into a mysterious, fluctuating, shadowy sky, of which, though the light penetrates through it all, you perceive every part to be charged with vapor. Notice particularly the half-indicated forms even where it is most serene, behind the snowy mountains. And now, how are the sunbeams drawn? no longer indecisive, flushing, palpitating, every one is sharp and clear, and terminated by definite shadow; note especially the marked lines on the upper cloud; finally, observe the difference in the mode of indicating the figures, which are here misty and indistinguishable, telling only as shadows, though they are near and large, while those in the former vignette came clear upon the eye, though they were so far off as to appear mere points.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: In {{this paper}} a {{consistent}} approach to geometric modeling of optimized lattice structures for additive manufacturing technologies is proposed. Design methodology: The proposed method applies subdivision surfaces schemes to an automatically defined initial mesh model of an arbitrarily complex lattice structure. The {{approach has been}} developed for cubic cells. Considering different aspects, five subdivision schemes have been studied: Mid-Edge, an original scheme proposed by the authors, Doo-Sabin, Catmull-Clark and Bi-Quartic. A generalization to other types of cell has also been proposed. Findings: The proposed approach allows to obtain consistent and smooth geometric models of optimized lattice structures, overcoming critical issues on complex models highlighted in literature, such as scalability, robustness and automation. Moreover, <b>no</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>edge</b> is obtained and consequently, stress concentration is reduced, improving static and fatigue resistance of the whole structure. Originality/value: An original and robust method for modeling optimized lattice structures was proposed, allowing to obtain mesh models suitable for additive manufacturing technologies. The method opens new perspectives {{in the development of}} specific CAD tools for additive manufacturing, based on mesh modeling and surface subdivision. These approaches as well as slicing tools are suitable for parallel computation and therefore allows the implementation of algorithms dedicated to graphics cards...|$|R

40|$|Ring-like {{features}} {{have been}} observed in several debris discs. Outside the main ring, while some systems exhibit smooth surface brightness profiles (SB) that fall off roughly as r**- 3. 5, others display large luminosity drops at the ring's outer edge and steeper radial SB profiles. We seek to understand this diversity of outer edge profiles under the "natural" collisional evolution of the system, without invoking external agents such as planets or gas. We use a statistical code to follow {{the evolution of a}} collisional population, ranging from dust grains (submitted to radiation pressure) to planetesimals and initially confined within a belt (the 'birth ring'). The system typically evolves toward a "standard" steady state, with <b>no</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>edge</b> and SB ∝ r**- 3. 5 outside the birth ring. Deviations from this standard profile, {{in the form of a}} <b>sharp</b> outer <b>edge</b> and a steeper fall-off, occur only when two parameters take their extreme values: 1) When the birth ring is so massive that it becomes radially optically thick for the smallest grains. However, the required disc mass is here probably too high to be realistic. 2) When the dynamical excitation of the dust-producing planetesimals is so low (< 0. 01) that the smallest grains, which otherwise dominate the total optical depth, are preferentially depleted. This low-excitation case, although possibly not generic, cannot be ruled out by observations. Our "standard" profile provides a satisfactory explanation for a large group of debris discs with outer edges and SB falling as r**- 3. 5. Systems with <b>sharper</b> outer <b>edges,</b> barring other confining agents, could still be explained by "natural" collisional evolution if their dynamical excitation is very low. We show that such a dynamically-cold case provides a satisfactory fit for HR 4796 AComment: Accepted for publication in A&A (abstract truncated here, full version in the pdf file); v 2 : typos corrected + rephrasing title of Section 5. 1. 2; v 3 :final technical change...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{numerical}} convergence of hydrodynamical simulations of self-gravitating accretion discs, {{in which a}} simple cooling law is balanced by shock heating. It is well-known that there exists a critical cooling time scale for which shock heating can no longer compensate for the energy losses, {{at which point the}} disc fragments. The nu-merical convergence of previous results of this critical cooling time scale was questioned recently using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). We employ a two-dimensional grid-based code to study this problem, and find that for smooth initial conditions, frag-mentation is possible for slower cooling as the resolution is increased, in agreement with recent SPH results. We show that this non-convergence is at least partly due {{to the creation of a}} special location in the disc, the boundary between the turbulent and the laminar region, when cooling towards a gravito-turbulent state. Converged results appear to be obtained in setups where <b>no</b> such <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> appear, and we then find a critical cooling time scale of ∼ 4 Ω− 1, where Ω is the local angular velocity...|$|R
