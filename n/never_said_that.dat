A notable {{witness for the}} defence was Haia Greenberg (aged 29), a local nurse who survived the Proskurov pogroms (now, Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine) and testified about the carnage. She <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Petliura personally participated in the event, but rather some other soldiers who did {{said that they were}} directed by Petliura.

500|$|As the [...] presidential {{election}} of 1792 approached, Washington, {{pleased with the}} progress his administration had made in establishing a strong, stable federal government, was planning to retire rather than seek a second term. He complained of old age, sickness, the in-fighting plaguing his cabinet, and the increasing hostility of the partisan press. However, {{the members of his}} cabinet—especially Jefferson and Hamilton—worked diligently through the summer and fall to persuade Washington not to retire. They apprised him of the potential impact the French Revolutionary Wars might have on the country, and insisted that only someone with his popularity and moderation could lead the nation effectively during the volatile times ahead. In the end, [...] "Washington never announced his candidacy in the election of 1792," [...] writes historian John Ferling, [...] "he simply <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he would not consider a second term." ...|$|E
500|$|Take-Two filed {{a lawsuit}} against 3D Realms over their failure to {{complete}} Duke Nukem Forever, citing that they paid $12 million to Infogrames in 2000 to acquire the publishing rights. 3D Realms argued, however, that they never received that money, as it was a direct agreement between Infogrames and Take-Two. The lawsuit seemed to be over a contractual breach, but not regarding the $12 million mentioned above. Take-Two asked for a restraining order and a preliminary injunction, to make 3D Realms keep the Duke Nukem Forever assets intact during proceedings, but the court denied the publisher's request for a temporary restraining order. In December 2009, Apogee CEO Scott Miller clarified that [...] "we've <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Duke Nukem Forever has ceased development, [...] we released the internal team, but that doesn't correlate to the demise of the project." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{story is}} an {{appealing}} one, {{but it is}} largely fictional. Gilbert was interviewed twice about his inspiration for The Mikado. [...] In both interviews the sword was mentioned, {{and in one of}} them he said it was the inspiration for the opera, although he <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the sword had fallen. What puts the entire story in doubt, moreover, is Cellier and Bridgeman's error concerning the Japanese exhibition in Knightsbridge: It did not open until 10 January 1885, almost two months after Gilbert had already completed Act I. Gilbert scholar Brian Jones, in his article [...] "The Sword that Never Fell", notes that [...] "the further removed in time the writer is from the incident, the more graphically it is recalled." [...] Leslie Baily, for instance, told it this way in 1952: ...|$|E

2500|$|Yet The Watchtowers public {{coverage}} of the same series of conventions was notable for its far more cautious tone. In its summary of the convention talks, the magazine reiterated the teaching that Bible chronology showed 6000 years of human existence would be completed in the mid-1970s, then pointed out: [...] "These publications have <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the world's end would come then. Nevertheless, there has been considerable individual speculation on the matter." [...] What was certain, the magazine said, was that the end would come within the generation of those who saw the beginning of world tribulations in 1914. [...] "So we can be confident that the end is near; {{we do not have}} the slightest doubt that God will bring it about ... we have to wait and see exactly when, in the meantime keeping busy in God's service." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 1949 book, Hindu Rashtra Darshan, Savakar wrote [...] "Nazism proved undeniably {{the savior}} of Germany". Savarkar often {{compared}} Germany's German majority and Jewish minority as analogous to India's Hindu majority and Muslim minority, though Savarkar never mentions the persecution of Jews in Germany. Gandhi himself praised the Nazis {{until the end of}} the War, when the Genocide came to light to the world, and condemnation followed. Savarkar <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he was a proponent of murder and genocide against minorities, and instead desired peaceful assimilation. Savarkar condemned both German Jews and the Indian Muslims for their supposed inability to assimilate. In 1938, he wrote, [...] "if we Hindus in India grow stronger in time, these Moslem friends of the league type will have to play the part of German Jews." [...] He further added that India [...] "must be a Hindu land, reserved for Hindus".|$|E
2500|$|The 5 to 8 percent figure {{put forward}} by Dodes is controversial; Thomas Beresford, MD., writing for the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, says that the book uses [...] "three separate, questionable, {{calculations}} that arrive at the 5-8% figure." [...] This {{is not the only}} criticism the book has received; The New York Times calls The Sober Truth a [...] "polemical and deeply flawed book" [...] and John F. Kelly, an associate professor at Harvard, as well as Gene Beresin, a professor at Harvard, feel that the book's conclusion that [...] " [...] approaches are almost completely ineffective and even harmful in treating substance use disorders" [...] is wrong (Dodes responded by pointing out that [...] "I have <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> AA is harmful in general"), noting that [...] "studies published in prestigious peer-reviewed scientific journals have found that 12-step treatments that facilitate engagement with AA post-discharge [...] produce about one third higher continuous abstinence rates" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{president}} wanted {{what he felt}} was an experienced jurist who could appeal to liberals in the party as well as law-and-order conservatives, noting privately that Warren [...] "represents the kind of political, economic, and social thinking that I believe we need on the Supreme Court.... He has a national name for integrity, uprightness, and courage that, again, I believe we need on the Court". In the next few years, Warren led the Court {{in a series of}} liberal decisions that revolutionized the role of the Court. Some writers believe that Eisenhower once remarked that his appointment was [...] "the biggest damn fool mistake I ever made". However, Eisenhower biographer Jean Edward Smith concluded in 2012 that [...] "Eisenhower <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>that.</b> I have no evidence that he ever made such a statement." [...] Eisenhower gave Warren a recess appointment that began on October 1, 1953. It was made permanent when the Senate acted on March 1, 1954. No serious opposition had appeared and he was confirmed by unanimous voice vote.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{reported}} in the press that the Sauber, Lotus and Force India teams had considered withdrawing from the race to signal a message to Formula One's commercial leaders about the current financial state of the sport following Caterham and Marussia's non-participation in the race. Ecclestone stated that if two of those teams left Formula One then [...] "that is what will happen" [...] and that teams should only be taking part if they were competitive. Force India team principal Bob Fernley said discussions about a boycott but it would only be performed as a final recourse. Lotus owner Gérard Lopez later admitted he had not heard about the proposed boycott and the team insisted that they would contest the Grand Prix. Vijay Mallya, the owner of Force India, severely criticised suggestions of a boycott six days after the race: [...] "Who said that we wanted to boycott the race? Please tell me. If I am wrong, you educate me. I speak on behalf of Force India. I have <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> we are going to boycott, and I have clarified this in Austin. Why would we? We have come to go racing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Feyerabend {{considered}} the possibility of incommensurability, but he was hesitant in his application of the concept. He wrote that [...] "it is hardly ever possible to give an explicit definition of [...] " [...] , because it involves covert classifications and major conceptual changes. He also was critical of attempts to capture incommensurability in a logical framework, since he thought of incommensurability as a phenomenon outside the domain of logic. In the second appendix of Against Method (p.114), Feyerabend states, [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>said...</b> <b>that</b> any two rival theories are incommensurable... What I did say was that certain rival theories, so-called 'universal' theories, or 'non-instantial' theories, if interpreted in a certain way, could not be compared easily." [...] Incommensurability did not concern Feyerabend greatly, because he believed that even when theories are commensurable (i.e. can be compared), {{the outcome of the}} comparison should not necessarily rule out either theory. To rephrase: when theories are incommensurable, they cannot rule each other out, and when theories are commensurable, they cannot rule each other out. Assessments of (in)commensurability, therefore, don't have much effect in Feyerabend's system, and can be more or less passed over in silence.|$|E
