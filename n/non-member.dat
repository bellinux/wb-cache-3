5|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{concurrence}} which {{stated that}} Congress {{was very careful}} to base the changes to the statute on inherent tribal powers and not on a delegation of authority. Kennedy states that {{is all that is}} needed to decide the case, but that the Court went further than was necessary when it decided that Congress had the power under the constitution to authorize tribes to prosecute <b>non-member</b> Indians. Finally, Kennedy was concerned that the court did not address the question of the Equal Protection Clause. He would have reversed the Eighth Circuit without going into the additional detail.|$|E

5|$|This article poses {{two general}} limits to <b>non-member</b> states. First, only European states are {{eligible}} for new membership, and second, these states not only need the approval of all the existing member states, but every member state can put some criteria forward {{that have to be}} attained. In practice, NATO formulates a common set of criteria, but for instance Greece blocks the Republic of Macedonia's accession to NATO, due to the disagreement over the use of the name Macedonia. Turkey similarly opposes the participation of the Republic of Cyprus with NATO institutions as long as the Cyprus dispute is not resolved.|$|E
5|$|Alexander F. Reichert was {{appointed}} by the Supreme Court to argue the case for Lara. Reichert argued that an Indian tribe had no inherent sovereignty in regards to <b>non-member</b> Indians, but only the power that Congress decided to give the tribe, citing Duro, Wheeler, and Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe to support his argument. He stated {{that it was the}} place of the Supreme Court, not Congress, to determine the inherent sovereignty of the tribe. Lara argued that since the tribe had no such inherent sovereignty, it could only prosecute a <b>non-member</b> Indian based upon federal sovereignty, which would make a subsequent Federal prosecution a violation of the prohibition of double jeopardy. It was noted that members of Indian tribes were at the same time United States citizens, and protected under the constitution {{in the same manner as}} any other citizen. Reichert stated that Duro was decided as a constitutional issue, not as a matter of common law, and it was the Court's place to determine the issue, not the place of Congress. To subject Lara to a prosecution by a tribal court, which was not subject to the Bill of Rights, would deprive Lara of his rights as a United States citizen. Lara's position was supported by amicus curiae briefs filed by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Lewis County, Idaho, (along with several other counties), the Citizen's Equal Rights Foundation, and T. Morris, E. Morris, and R. Morris (individual Indians).|$|E
5|$|In 1203 Norreis, {{secure in}} his {{alliance}} {{with his own}} monks, once again began to exploit the monastery for his own profit {{and that of his}} family and friends. His monks became upset at this renewal of their exploitation and sent Thomas, along with other monks, to appropriate the harvest from some lands that had been given by Norreis to a <b>non-member</b> of the community. Norreis protested to King John and to Hubert Walter. Both the king and Walter summoned Thomas to appear before them separately and explain the actions of the monks. Thomas failed to persuade either man and nothing was done about Norreis's exactions and abuse of his monks.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} been {{neglected}} {{the behavior of the}} owners who are <b>non-members</b> when discussing brand community (BC), even though they are substantially larger. This study purposely discuss what are {{the differences between the two}} by using model of goal directed behavior (MGB) and uses the findings as a way to recruit <b>non-members</b> in BC activities. This study also proposes some refinements to the original concept of MGB. This survey-based study, conducted with 201 active members and 226 <b>non-members</b> of a motor club in Indonesia, employs structural equation modeling methodology which supports the proposed model. The findings suggest that <b>non-members</b> have a stronger effect of positive anticipated emotions on attitude and desire to participate, which could be the starting point for marketers to recruit them. While for <b>non-members,</b> the perceived behavioral control and attitude toward BC activities have greater effects. The findings and discussion lead to some managerial and research implications...|$|R

Before its formal dedication, over 50 percent of the Tongan population had toured the temple. The church's Nuku'alofa Tonga Temple was dedicated in 1983 by Gordon B. Hinckley as Kimball was ill and could not attend the dedication. There were seven dedicatory sessions held, most of which took place in the Liahona School gymnasium. 15,000 people were in attendance of these sessions.|$|E
5|$|Justice David Souter wrote a dissenting opinion, {{which was}} joined by Justice Antonin Scalia. Souter {{referenced}} prior cases dealing with sovereignty and jurisdiction, from the decision made in United States v. Kagama, to the opinion made in South Dakota v. Bourland. Souter stated that the decision in this case did not align with precedent established in previous cases. Since Duro held that the tribes had lost their inherent sovereignty, {{the only way for}} the tribes to regain jurisdiction over <b>non-member</b> Indians would be by the delegation of that jurisdiction by Congress. Bourland was even more specific as to that point. Souter believed that the only two ways that the tribes could regain their sovereignty would be for Congress to declare that they were independent of the United States, as it did with the Philippines, or for the Court to overturn the concept of a dependent domestic sovereign.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the goal}} of the Wall of Fame was to induct the {{greatest}} players in Phillies and Athletics history; however, exceptions have been made for non-players who have made significant contributions to the organization. Mack, the Athletics' first inductee, had an 11-year playing career in the National League and the Players' League, but is most remembered for his managerial career, and was honored as such on the Wall. Members have been inducted for contributions in more than one area; Paul Owens, inducted in 1988, spent 48 years {{as a member of the}} Phillies organization, contributing as a scout, manager, general manager, and team executive. The Phillies have inducted four first basemen, four second basemen, five third basemen, three shortstops, one utility infielder, three catchers, 21 outfielders, 18 pitchers, seven managers, one general manager, one coach, two team executives, and two sportscasters. Twenty-one members of the Wall of Fame are also members of the Baseball Hall of Fame.

5|$|Under Protocol 3, Jersey {{is part of}} the European Union Customs Union of the European Community. The common customs tariff, levies {{and other}} {{agricultural}} import measures apply to trade between the island and <b>non-Member</b> States. There is free movement of goods and trade between the island and Member States. EU rules on freedom of movement for workers do not apply in Jersey. However, Article 4 of the Protocol requires the island's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities. In Pereira, the ECJ held that {{the scope of this article}} included any matter governed by the Treaties in a territory where the Treaties are fully applicable. The island is therefore within the scope of the Treaties to a limited extent, as a European Territory. To infer, as the French Ambassador and finance minister have attempted to argue, namely that the island is outside the European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic, in law false. The French blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out. As a result, Jersey is not part of the single market in financial services. It is not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as movement of capital, company law or money laundering. However, the island's close proximity (135km south) and its close association with the financial sector of the U.K. has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with several mainline publications (e.g., The Wall Street Journal) labelling the island a tax haven.|$|E

40|$|Using highly {{detailed}} {{import data}} for Thailand, this paper examines firm-level trade creation and diversion of regional trade agreements (RTAs). Specifically, {{by focusing on}} firm-product pairs in which firms import a particular product from <b>non-members</b> but not from RTA members in the initial year of our sample, we empirically investigate the start of imports from RTA members under RTA schemes and the cessation of imports from <b>non-members</b> at the firm-level. We find that firms {{are more likely to}} stop importing products with low RTA tariff rates or high most-favored-nation tariff rates from <b>non-members</b> and to start importing such products from RTA member countries. However, from the quantitative point of view, there are very few firms that switch import sources from <b>non-members</b> to RTA members when facing the introduction of RTA schemes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationships}} between travel lifestyle preferences and destination activity choices of Slow Food members and <b>non-members.</b> Food {{is an important component}} of Slow Food members 2 ̆ 7 lifestyle, and members practice the Slow Food philosophy in their daily lives. It was therefore expected that lifestyle preferences would influence destination activity choices in different ways for Slow Food members and <b>non-members.</b> This proposition was tested by comparing 337 Slow Food members 2 ̆ 7 and 207 <b>non-members</b> 2 ̆ 7 questionnaire responses. The results suggest that Slow Food members differed significantly from <b>non-members</b> in travel-related lifestyle preferences and destination activity choices. Slow Food members had lower interest in comfortable travel and higher interest in local culture compared with <b>non-members.</b> This study also found travel lifestyle preferences significantly influenced destination activity choices. Independently of the motivation to travel to a destination, this study offered evidence that travel lifestyle preferences influence participants 2 ̆ 7 destination activity choices. An investigation {{of the impact of the}} diverse cultural backgrounds of Slow Food members is suggested as a future area of study...|$|R
