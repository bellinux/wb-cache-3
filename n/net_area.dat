40|$|An {{isotropic}} {{fine grain}} graphite (EK 98) block {{has been exposed}} to the edge plasma in the TEXTOR tokamak and studied by Raman spectroscopy. Spectra from the <b>net</b> erosion <b>area</b> and deposition area where co-deposits (hard layer) were created by the tokamak discharges, are remarkably different. The spectra at the <b>net</b> erosion <b>areas</b> consist of two sharp peaks: the D-peak (1355 cm-') and the G-peak (approximate to 1580 cm(- 1)). The spectra at the <b>net</b> deposition <b>areas</b> were very broad, which are similar to the Raman spectra of amorphous carbon. Fitting analyses of the Raman spectra for the <b>net</b> erosion <b>area</b> exhibit a linear relationship between the G-peak width (FWHMG) and the peak intensity ratio (I-D/I-G). Comparison with the diagram derived for ion-irradiated graphite revealed that thermally unstable defects of single vacancies scarcely remained due to the power loading in this plasma exposure condition but thermally stable defects such as the dislocation dipoles could be accumulated.

40|$|Abstract- Agriculture is an {{economic}} activity that manifests the complex relationship between natural and human resources. The growth of agriculture is prerequisite for overall development of Indian economy. It contributes significantly to the export earnings and affects the performance of other {{sectors of the economy}} through forward and backward linkages. The present paper analysis disparities in agricultural development in Aligarh district at block level during the period of 2011 - 12. The analysis of the study have been carried out by transforming and combining data related to various variable, (percentage of literate people to total population, percentage of agricultural workers to total workers, percentage of <b>net</b> sown <b>area</b> to total geographical area, fertilizers consumption in kg per hectare, percentage of <b>net</b> irrigated <b>area</b> to <b>net</b> sown <b>area,</b> percentage of canal irrigation to the <b>net</b> irrigated <b>area,</b> percentage of tube well irrigation to the <b>net</b> irrigated <b>area,</b> number of agricultural implements per thousand hectare, cropping intensity) using Z score to get composite score, development of blocks have been categorized into three categories i. e., high, medium and low.
