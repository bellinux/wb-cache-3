The {{system is designed}} to produce 440 kW of net electrical power, sized for a typical long-range 300 -passenger civil airplane, at both sea level and cruise flight level (12, 500 m). In addition, a part power level of 250 kW is analyzed at the cruise condition, a requirement of the operating power profile. The challenge of creating a balanced system for the three distinct conditions is presented, along with the compromises necessary for each case. A parametric analysis is described for the cruise part power operating point, in which the system efficiency is maximized by varying the air flow rate. The system is compared to an earlier version that was designed solely for cruise operation.

40|$|The {{idea is to}} {{find out}} whether 2 nd law {{efficiency}} optimization may be a suitable trade-off between maximum work output and maximum 1 st law efficiency designs for a regenerative gas turbine engine operating on the basis of an open Brayton cycle. The primary emphasis is placed on analyzing the ideal cycle to determine the upper limit of the engine. Explicit relationships are established for work and entropy production of the ideal cycle. To examine whether a Brayton cycle may operate at the regime of fully reversible characterized by zero entropy generation condition, the cycle net work is computed. It is shown that an ideal Brayton-type engine with or without a regenerator cannot operate at fully reversible limit. Subsequently, the analysis is expanded to an irreversible cycle and the relevant relationships are obtained for <b>net</b> work, <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency,</b> total entropy production, and second law efficiency defined as the <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the irreversible cycle divided by the <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the ideal cycle. The effects of the compressor and turbine efficiencies, regenerator effectiveness, pressure drop in the cycle and the ratio of maximum-to-minimum cycle temperature on optimum pressure ratios obtained by maximization of 1 st and 2 nd law efficiencies and work output are examined. The results indicate that for the regenerator effectiveness greater than 0. 82, the 2 nd law efficiency optimization may be considered as a trade-off between the maximum work output and the maximum 1 st law efficiency.

The flowsheets were developed for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) program, and couple a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer for the SO 2 -depolarized electrolysis step with a silicon carbide bayonet reactor for the high-temperature decomposition step. One presumes an HTGR reactor outlet temperature (ROT) of 950 C, the other 750 C.

During the process a combustible gas (‘torgas’) consisting of different organic compound is also produced {{in addition to}} the torrefied solid product. In a properly designed and operated torrefaction system the torgas may be combusted to generate heat for the drying and torrefaction steps, thus increasing the overall process efficiency. In this paper, a simple process simulation of a stand-alone torrefaction plant with internal heat integration was performed to assess whether autothermal operation is conceivable for high moisture tomato peel residues (TPs). Results show that for typical torrefaction conditions where about 20 - 30 % of the dry mass is removed in the form of volatile gases (i. e., 285 °C and 30 min for TPs), the process cannot be autothermal and, consequently, an additional utility fuel is required.

On the other side, it is well known that brown coal contains significant amounts of moisture which decreases the overall plant thermal efficiency due to the increased flue gas thermal loses. In order to keep the competitive edge of brown coal, an improvement of the power plant efficiency is required. One way to achieve this target is to dry the moist brown coal before combustion.

Three dryers using steam as a drying agent, e. g. the tubular dryer, the fluidised bed dryer and the mechanical thermal dewatering process are compared to the conventional flue gas drying technology using a computer simulation.

40|$|The {{oxy-fuel}} {{combined cycle}} (OCC) {{is one of}} several carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies being developed to reduce CO 2 emissions from thermal power plants. The OCC consists of a semi-closed topping Bryton cycle, and a traditional bottoming Rankine cycle. The topping cycle operates with a working medium mixture of mainly CO 2 and H 2 O. This CO 2 -rich working fluid has significantly different gas properties compared to a conventional open gas turbine cycle, which thereby affects the aerodynamic turbine design for the gas turbine units. The aerodynamic turbine design for oxyfuel gas turbines is an unexplored research field. The topic of this study was therefore to investigate the aerodynamic turbine design of turbines operating with a CO 2 -rich working fluid. The investigation was performed through a typical turbine aerodesign loop, which covered the 1 D mid-span, 2 D through-flow, 3 D blade profiling design and the steady-state 3 D analysis. The design was performed through the use of conventional design methods and criteria in order to investigate if any significant departures from conventional turbine design methods were required. The survey revealed some minor deviations in design considerations, yet it showed that the design is feasible with today's state-of-the-art technology by using conventional design practice and methods. The performance of the oxy-fuel combined cycle was revised based on the performance figures from the components design. The expected total performance figures for the oxy-fuel combined cycle were calculated to be a net electrical power of 119. 9 MW and a <b>net</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 48. 2 %. These figures include the parasitic consumption for the oxygen production required for the combustion and the CO 2 compression of the CO 2 bleed stream...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{performance}} of 13 working fluids in two Organic Rankine Cycles, which operate as the bottoming cycles for recovering waste heat from gas turbine modular helium reactor (GT-MHR), is investigated. Working fluids are classified in three dry, isentropic and wet fluids. The effect of varying pump temperature and evaporator pressure on the <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency,</b> total exergy loss of the combined cycle is studied for each category, {{and the results are}} compared. The results are calculated for an optimum pressure ratio in which <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> is maximum. According to the results, dry fluids show a higher <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> while wet fluids have the lowest values. However, the highest value for <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> is for R 141 b, which is an isentropic fluid. Furthermore, the results indicate that pump temperature increase, reduces the total <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> and increases the total exergy loss of the combined cycle. Increasing evaporator pressure leads to an optimum pressure that maximizes total <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency.</b> According to the optimized pressure ratio and evaporator pressure, R 141 b in isentropic fluids, R 123 in dry fluids and R 717 in wet fluids have the highest <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> values...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, three typical {{test methods}} for <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of biomass stoves were discussed. The effect {{factors such as}} {{operation}} process, test ending time, pot sizes, amount {{of water on the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of domestic biomass cookstoves were studied. The results show that the test ending time and the amount of water used have major impacts on <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The amount of water is in positive correlation with the <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the stove (R= 0. 92) when the heat needed for the selected amount of water is less than actual power output of stoves. The <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> is more controllable and accurate when the test ending time is 2 ℃ lower than the boiling point and the amount of water is selected according to the actual power output of stoves...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the influence of three significant parameters, namely, swirl flow, loading height, and semi-confined combustion flame, on <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> and CO emissions of a swirl flow gas burner. We focus particularly on the effects of swirl angle and inclination angle on the performance of the swirl flow burner. The results showed that the swirl flow burner yields higher <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> and emits lower CO concentration than those of the conventional radial flow burner. A greater swirl angle results in higher <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> and CO emission. With increasing loading height, the <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> increases but the CO emission decreases. For a lower loading height (2 or 3 [*]cm), the highest efficiency occurs at the inclination angle 15 °. On the other hand, at a higher loading height, 4 [*]cm, <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> increases with the inclination angle. Moreover, the addition of a shield can achieve a great increase in <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency,</b> about 4 - 5 %, and a decrease in CO emissions for the same burner (swirl flow or radial flow) ...|$|R
