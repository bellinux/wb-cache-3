The (average) velocity (v) {{of an object}} {{is defined as the}} quantitative physical property of the object that is directly proportional to the distance (d) traveled by the object and inversely proportional to the time (t) of travel, i.e., v = kd/t, where k is a constant that depends on the units used. Suppose that the meter (m) and the second (s) are base units; then the kilometer (km) and the hour (h) are <b>noncoherent</b> derived units. The meter per second (mps) is defined as the velocity of an object that travels one meter in one second, and the kilometer per hour (kmph) is defined as the velocity of an object that travels one kilometer in one hour. Substituting from the definitions of the units into the defining equation of velocity we obtain, 1 mps = k m/s and 1 kmph = k km/h = 1/3.6 k m/s = 1/3.6 mps. Now choose k = 1; then the meter per second is a coherent derived unit, and the kilometer per hour is a <b>noncoherent</b> derived unit. Suppose that we choose to use the kilometer per hour as the unit of velocity in the system. Then the system becomes <b>noncoherent,</b> and the numerical value equation for velocity becomes {v} = 3.6 {d}/{t}. Coherence may be restored, without changing the units, by choosing k = 3.6; then the kilometer per hour is a coherent derived unit, with 1 kmph = 1 m/s, and the meter per second is a <b>noncoherent</b> derived unit, with 1 mps = 3.6 m/s.|$|E

Unless the coherence interval is large, coherent communication, which requires explicit channel estimation and tracking prior to detection, incurs training overhead which may be excessive, especially for multiple-antenna communication. In contrast, <b>noncoherent</b> detection {{may be viewed as}} a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) which jointly estimates the channel and the data, and hence does not require separate training. The main results in this paper are as follows 1) We develop a “signal space ” criterion for signal and code design for <b>noncoherent</b> communication, in terms of the distances of signal points from the decision boundaries. 2) The <b>noncoherent</b> metric thus obtained is used to guide the design of signals for <b>noncoherent</b> communication that are based on amplitude/phase constellations. These are significantly more efficient than conventional differential phaseshift keying (PSK), especially at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Also, known results on the high-SNR performance of multiple-symbol demodulation of differential PSK are easily inferred from the <b>noncoherent</b> metric. 3) The GLRT interpretation is used to obtain near-optimal lowcomplexity implementations of <b>noncoherent</b> block demodulation. In particular, this gives an implementation of multiple symbol demodulation of differential PSK, which is of linear complexity (in the block length) and whose degradation from the exact, exponential complexity, implementation can be made as small as desired.

Furthermore, the <b>noncoherent</b> optimal receiver includes an inherent estimator for the specular component phasor.
