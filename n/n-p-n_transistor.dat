50|$|Bipolar {{transistors}} are {{so named}} because they conduct by using both majority and minority carriers. The bipolar junction transistor, the first type of transistor to be mass-produced, {{is a combination of}} two junction diodes, and is formed of either a thin layer of p-type semiconductor sandwiched between two n-type semiconductors (an <b>n-p-n</b> <b>transistor),</b> or a thin layer of n-type semiconductor sandwiched between two p-type semiconductors (a p-n-p transistor). This construction produces two p-n junctions: a base-emitter junction and a base-collector junction, separated by a thin region of semiconductor known as the base region (two junction diodes wired together without sharing an intervening semiconducting region will not make a transistor).|$|E
50|$|Because the {{electron}} mobility {{is higher than}} the hole mobility for all semiconductor materials, a given bipolar <b>n-p-n</b> <b>transistor</b> tends to be swifter than an equivalent p-n-p transistor. GaAs has the highest electron mobility of the three semiconductors. It {{is for this reason that}} GaAs is used in high-frequency applications. A relatively recent FET development, the high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT), has a heterostructure (junction between different semiconductor materials) of aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs)-gallium arsenide (GaAs) which has twice {{the electron}} mobility of a GaAs-metal barrier junction. Because of their high speed and low noise, HEMTs are used in satellite receivers working at frequencies around 12 GHz. HEMTs based on gallium nitride and aluminium gallium nitride (AlGaN/GaN HEMTs) provide a still higher electron mobility and are being developed for various applications.|$|E

50|$|BJTs {{have three}} terminals, {{corresponding}} to the three layers of semiconductor—an emitter, a base, and a collector. They are useful in amplifiers because the currents at the emitter and collector are controllable by a relatively small base current. In an <b>n-p-n</b> <b>transistor</b> operating in the active region, the emitter-base junction is forward biased (electrons and holes recombine at the junction), and electrons are injected into the base region. Because the base is narrow, most of these electrons will diffuse into the reverse-biased (electrons and holes are formed at, and {{move away from the}} junction) base-collector junction and be swept into the collector; perhaps one-hundredth of the electrons will recombine in the base, which is the dominant mechanism in the base current. By controlling the number of electrons that can leave the base, the number of electrons entering the collector can be controlled. Collector current is approximately β (common-emitter current gain) times the base current. It is typically greater than 100 for small-signal transistors but can be smaller in transistors designed for high-power applications.|$|E

Moore, Hoerni and Last led three teams working on three alternative technologies. The technology of Moore resulted in a higher yield of operational <b>n-p-n</b> <b>transistors,</b> and in July–September 1958, they went into mass production. The release of p-n-p transistors of Hoerni was delayed until early 1959. This created the Moore-Hoerni conflict at Fairchild: Moore ignored the contribution of Hoerni, and Hoerni believed that his work was unfairly treated.

40|$|A {{differential}} SiGe oscillator circuit uses a resonant ring-oscillator topology {{in order}} to electronically tune the oscillator over multi-octave bandwidths. The oscillator s tuning is extremely linear, because the oscillator s frequency depends on the magnetic tuning of a YIG sphere, whose resonant frequency is equal to a fundamental constant times the DC magnetic field. This extremely simple circuit topology uses two coupling loops connecting a differential pair of SiGe bipolar transistors into a feedback configuration using a YIG tuned filter creating a closed-loop ring oscillator. SiGe device technology is used for this oscillator {{in order to}} keep the transistor s 1 /f noise to an absolute minimum in order to achieve minimum RF phase noise. The single-end resonant ring oscillator currently has an advantage in fewer parts, but when the oscillation frequency is greater than 16 GHz, the package s parasitic behavior couples energy to the sphere and causes holes and poor phase noise performance. This is because the coupling to the YIG is extremely low, so that the oscillator operates at near the unloaded Q. With the differential resonant ring oscillator, the oscillation currents are just in the YIG coupling mechanisms. The phase noise is even better, and the physical size can be reduced to permit monolithic microwave integrated circuit oscillators. This invention is a YIG tuned oscillator circuit making use of a differential topology to simultaneously achieve an extremely broadband electronic tuning range and ultra-low phase noise. As a natural result of its differential circuit topology, all reactive elements, such as tuning stubs, which limit tuning bandwidth by contributing excessive open loop phase shift, have been eliminated. The differential oscillator s open-loop phase shift is associated with completely non-dispersive circuit elements such as the physical angle of the coupling loops, a differential loop crossover, and the high-frequency phase shift of the <b>n-p-n</b> <b>transistors.</b> At the input of the oscillator s feedback loop is a pair of differentially connected <b>n-p-n</b> SiGe <b>transistors</b> that provides extremely high gain, and because they are bulk-effect devices, extremely low 1 /f noise (leading to ultralow RF phase noise).

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 In view {{of recent}} {{developments}} in large-scale, complex digital systems, it is of interest to broaden the study of two-leveled logical systems {{to the study of}} three-leveled systems. This paper introduces the ternary logic system and develops a design approach for ternary digital systems that is based on familiar binary techniques. Ternary number systems are introduced and two base-conversion algorithms are given: one for integral numbers and the other for fractional numbers. Ternary arithmetic is similar to binary arithmetic or to decimal arithmetic. Four algebraic operations, Cycling, Negation, And, and Or, are then defined and the algebra is systematically developed through postulates and theorems. The algebraic method of minimization is difficult for a large number of variables or terms, and the map method is impracticable for more than three variables. Hence a programmable minimization method is developed by analogy with the Quine-McCluskey method for binary minimization. Diode-transistor schemes of circuit realization are presented. In these, the idea is to use p-n-p and <b>n-p-n</b> <b>transistor</b> pairs to provide the three different voltage levels desired. Tristable devices using three Cycling-gates are also described.

40|$|An abrupt p-n junction, such as {{occurs at}} the {{collector}} junction of an <b>n-p-n</b> <b>transistor,</b> is considered. The ratio of n- to p-region conductivity is taken to be very high, so that the transition region is restricted almost entirely to the p-region. The electron density distribution n within the transition region is investigated {{as a function of}} the applied reverse bias V_c, and of the minority carrier electron current density J which is injected into the transition region from the neutral p- region. It is shown that significant departures occur from the conventional solutions in which the presence of current is neglected. In particular, the electron density n_c at the plane of injection and the transition region thickness w_t, used as collector boundary conditions in the analysis of transistor operation, are shown to be current-dependent. Two cases are considered. In Case I, applicable to transistors with an epitaxial layer under the collector, the electron velocity is assumed much less than the limiting drift velocity. For low injection level, where the minority carrier density n is everywhere less than the equilibrium majority carrier density p_p, the transition region is a essentially a depletion region and the injected electrons move in an electric field determined uniquely by the applied voltage. It is shown that n_ ∝ J and w_t ∝ V_c^(l/ 2). For high injection level, hen n >> p_p, the transition region is essentially an accumulation region, and conditions of space-charge-limited current flow are established for which n_c ∝ J^(2 / 3) and w_t ∝ V_c^(2 / 3 /(J^(l-/ 3)). In Case II, applicable to most alloy and diffused-base transistors, the electron velocity is assumed equal to the limiting drift velocity throughout the transition region. Mobile carrier depletion at low injection again gives way to accumulation at high injection. The functional relationships remain as for Case I at low injection, but become n_c ∝ J, w_t ∝ V_c^(l/ 2 /J^(1 / 2)) at high injection.

40|$|Numerical {{iterative}} {{methods of}} {{solution of the}} one-dimensional basic two-carrier transport equations describing the behavior of semiconductor junctions under both steady-state and transient conditions are presented. The methods are of a very general character: none of the conventional assumptions and restrictions are introduced, and freedom {{is available in the}} choice of the doping profile, generation-recombination law, mobility dependencies, injection level., and boundary conditions applied solely at the external contacts. For a specified arbitrary input signal of either current or voltage (as a function of time) the solution yields terminal properties and all the quantities of interest in the interior of the device, such as carrier densities, electric field, electrostatic potential, particle and displacement currents, as functions of position (and time). The work is divided into two parts. In Part I a numerical method of solution of the steady-state problem, already available in the literature, is improved and extended, and is applied to a two-contact and a three-contact device. The analytical formulation of the original method is shown to be unsuitable for generating a sound numerical algorithm sufficiently accurate and valid for high reverse bias conditions. Difficulties and limitations are exposed and overcome by an improved formulation extended to any bias condition. As a simple application of the improved formulation, "exact" and first-order theory results for an idealized N-P structure are presented and compared. The poorness of some of the basic assumptions of the conventional first-order theory is exposed, in spite of a satisfactory agreement between the exact and first-order results of the terminal properties for particular bias conditions. Results for an <b>N-P-N</b> <b>transistor</b> are also reported and the inadequacy of the one-dimensional model discussed. The time-dependent analysis of the problem is presented in Part II. The fundamental equations are rearranged to an equivalent set of three non-linear partial differential equations more suitable for numerical methods. A highly non-uniform two-dimensional mesh, subject to maintenance of constant truncation errors in both spatial and time domains of certain pointwise operations, is chosen for the discretization of the problem, in view of the variation of most quantities over extreme ranges within short regions. Consequently an implicit discretization scheme is selected for the second-order partial differential equations of the parabolic type in order to avoid restrictions on the mesh size, without endangering numerical stability. An iterative procedure is necessary at each instant of time to cope with the several non-linearities of the problem and to achieve consistency between the internal distributions and the generating equations. This procedure is easily generalized to incorporate equations pertinent to networks of passive elements and ideal generators connected to the semiconductor device. Results for a particular single-junction structure under typical time-dependent excitations of external current and terminal voltage, and for an N-P diode interacting with an external resistor under switching conditions., are reported and discussed in detail. Considerable attention is focused on the numerical analysis of the steady-state and transient problems in order to achieve a numerical algorithm sufficiently sound and efficient to cope with the several difficulties of the problem, such as the small differences between nearly equal numbers, the variation of most quantities over extremely wide ranges in short regions, and the stability conditions related to the discretization of partial differential equations of the parabolic type...|$|E
