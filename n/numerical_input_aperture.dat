40|$|Optoelectronic {{microsystems}} {{are more}} and more prevalent as researchers seek to increase transmission bandwidths, implement electrical isolation, enhance security, or take advantage of sensitive optical sensing methods. Board level photonic integration techniques continue to improve, but photonic microsystems and fiber interfaces remain problematic, especially upon size reduction. Optical fiber is unmatched as a transmission medium for distances ranging from tens of centimeters to kilometers. The difficulty with using optical fiber is the small size of the core (approximately 9 {micro}m for the core of single mode telecommunications fiber) and the tight requirement on spot size and <b>input</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture</b> (NA). Coupling to devices such as vertical cavity emitting lasers (VCSELs) and photodetectors presents further difficulties since these elements work in a plane orthogonal to the electronics board and typically require additional optics. This leads to the need for a packaging solution that can incorporate dissimilar materials while maintaining the tight alignment tolerances required by the optics. Over the course of this LDRD project, we have examined the capabilities of components such as VCSELs and photodetectors for high-speed operation and investigated the alignment tolerances required by the optical system. A solder reflow process has been developed to help fulfill these packaging requirements and the results of that work are presented here...|$|R
40|$|The <b>input</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture</b> (NA) of {{multimode}} fiber (MMF) can be effectively increased by placing turbid media at the input {{end of the}} MMF. This provides the potential for high-resolution imaging through the MMF. While the input NA is increased, the number of propagation modes in the MMF and hence the output NA remains the same. This makes the image reconstruction process underdetermined and may limit {{the quality of the}} image reconstruction. In this paper, we aim to improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the image reconstruction in imaging through MMF. We notice that turbid media placed in the input of the MMF transforms the incoming waves into a better format for information transmission and information extraction. We call this transformation as holistic random (HR) encoding of turbid media. By exploiting the HR encoding, we make a considerable improvement on the SNR of the image reconstruction. For efficient utilization of the HR encoding, we employ sparse representation (SR), a relatively new signal reconstruction framework when it is provided with a HR encoded signal. This study shows {{for the first time to}} our knowledge the benefit of utilizing the HR encoding of turbid media for recovery in the optically underdetermined systems where the output NA of it is smaller than the input NA for imaging through MMF.

40|$|Studies have {{stressed}} the importance of counting with children to promote formal numeracy abilities; however little work has investigated when parents begin to engage in this behavior with their young children. In the current study, we investigated whether parents elaborated on numerical information when reading a counting book to their preverbal infants and whether developmental differences in <b>numerical</b> <b>input</b> exist even {{in the first year of}} life. Parents and their 5 - 10 month old infants were asked to read, as they would at home, two books to their infants: a counting book and another book that did not have numerical content. Parents’ spontaneous statements rarely focused on number and those that did consisted primarily of counting, with little emphasis on labeling the cardinality of the set. However, developmental differences were observed even in this age range, such that parents were more likely to make numerical utterances when reading to older infants. Together, results are the first to characterize naturalistic reading behaviors between parents and their preverbal infants in the context of counting books, suggesting that although counting books promote numerical language in parents, infants still receive very little in the way of <b>numerical</b> <b>input</b> before the end of the first year of life.

40|$|Abstract—Since {{controller}} applications must typically satisfy real-time constraints while manipulating real-world variables, their implementation {{often results}} in programs that run ex-tremely fast and manipulate <b>numerical</b> <b>inputs</b> and outputs. These characteristics make them particularly suitable for test case generation. In fact a number of test cases can be easily created, due to the simplicity of <b>numerical</b> <b>inputs,</b> and executed, due to the speed of computations. In this paper we present G-RankTest, a technique for test case generation and prioritization. The key idea is that test case generation can run for long sessions (e. g., days) to accurately sample {{the behavior of a}} controller application and then the generated test cases can be prioritized according to different strategies, and used for regression testing every time the application is modified. In this work we investigate the feasibility of using the gradient of the output as a criterion for selecting the test cases that activate the most tricky behaviors, which we expect easier to break when a change occurs, and thus deserve priority in regression testing.

40|$|In ultra high {{capacity}} WDM, much research interest focuses on {{very large number}} of channels, good filter characteristics for each channel such as flat passing band, ease of implementation and implementation with minimized device size. We propose novel WDM schemes in 2 -D as well as 3 -D geometry. The proposed methods utilize irregular and zero-crossing sampling techniques. The nonuniform-sampling of zero-crossing apertures where phase is zero (or a constant) is realized by choosing the initial nonuniformly distributed points first and then calculating the closest zero-crossing points which satisfy the zero phase condition. Both linear and spherical reference waves can be used. We have a scheme which can be used to suppress higher harmonic order diffractions when used in grating structures and also to improve conventional arrayed waveguide gratings. In order to simplify implementation and achieve better results, we extend our method with MMSE iterative optimization. In this approach, regular arrayed apertures are pre-assigned along the input-focusing plane and then we choose the best end points (sampling points) which satisfy the zero phase condition closely. This approach again results in an irregular array. Next the MMSE algorithm is applied to improve output amplitudes. The aperture points proposed in 2 -D geometry are generalized into aperture points in 3 -D geometry. In addition, a sampled phase modulation method is introduced to generate and to perform multiplexing/demultiplexing. The optical waveguide is located at the sampling quantized point in <b>input</b> <b>aperture</b> plane and all reconstruction images can be achieved through specially chosen quantized points approximating zero-crossing points. An <b>input</b> <b>aperture</b> plane is composed of some sub-input planes, and each sub-input plane is designed to produce one row of image points (corresponding to different channels) on the image plane with a central wavelength. These can be arranged in to M rows with each row having N image points, corresponding to a total of MN channels. ...|$|R

40|$|Random Testing (RT) is a {{fundamental}} software testing technique. Adaptive Random Testing (ART) improves the fault-detection capability of RT by employing the location information of previously executed test cases. Compared with RT, test cases generated in ART are more evenly spread across the input domain. ART has conventionally been applied to programs that have only <b>numerical</b> <b>input</b> types, because the distance between <b>numerical</b> <b>inputs</b> is readily measurable. The vast majority of computer programs, however, involve non-numerical inputs. To apply ART to these programs requires the development of effective new distance measures.

The proposed method enables ART to be applied to all kinds of programs regardless of their input types. Empirical studies are further conducted for the branch coverage Manhattan distance measure using the replace and space programs. Experimental results show that, compared with RT, the proposed method significantly reduces the number of test cases required to detect the first failure.
