Her father reluctantly allows her {{to remain in the}} family home; eventually he too forgives her, although he can <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> shame she has brought on the family. Carry remains with her family {{for the rest of her}} life, but although she has returned to decency, her past ensures that she will never find an honest husband.|$|E
5|$|The {{team was}} {{generally}} very well received outside London, {{and especially in}} north, where rugby was dominated by the working-class. Reaction to the team in the south, where the public school establishment controlled the game, was less positive, and the sportsmanship of the team was criticised. Despite this, Ellison clearly enjoyed the experience of touring with the team, and in 1902 he wrote—"I shall <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> trip, notwithstanding the extremely heavy programme of fixtures {{we had to go}} through. Perhaps the most delightful part of our experiences was tasted not so much on the field of play as off it".|$|E

25|$|It {{was a real}} {{shock for}} Bohr...who, at first, {{could not think of}} a solution. For the entire evening he was {{extremely}} agitated, and he continued passing from one scientist to another, seeking to persuade them that it could not be the case, {{that it would have been}} the end of physics if Einstein were right; but he couldn't come up with any way to resolve the paradox. I will <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> image of the two antagonists as they left the club: Einstein, with his tall and commanding figure, who walked tranquilly, with a mildly ironic smile, and Bohr who trotted along beside him, full of excitement...The morning after saw the triumph of Bohr.|$|E
25|$|In particular, I shall <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> Barbarians game at Cardiff Arms Park to end our Grand Slam tour of 1984. We weren't in {{such good}} shape – our {{discipline}} had surrendered to celebration after beating Scotland {{and we knew}} {{this was to be}} Europe's game of retribution against us. We seemed to be constantly counter-attacking to get out of trouble and then Campese struck. He made a break from within his own half, the defence came at him and he stepped left and right with remarkable speed. And in the twinkling of an eye, the try line was his. But he had one defender to beat, the Welsh centre Robert Ackerman. Ackerman, unfortunately, had criticised the Australian victory after our crushing victory in the Test against Wales and Campo didn't have the words to retaliate then. But he retaliated now, with his feet and hands. He turned Ackerman inside out, threatening to go past, then changing direction, offering himself to be tackled then accelerating away until the crowd erupted, first in disbelief, then in sheer amusement and joy at what they were seeing. One yard from the line, Campo passed to Michael Hawker, and I'm sure, to this day, the pass was forward, but the referee knew he had seen artistry of incomparable dimension at work and the only reward he could offer was a try, which he duly did. It's an image I'll always associate with Campese. It remains for me the metaphor of his career.|$|E

"Nunca Voy a Olvidarte" [...] (English: [...] "I Am Never Going to Forget You") {{is a song}} {{written by}} Roberto Belester and first {{recorded}} by Mexican norteño band Bronco for their album Salvaje y Tierno (1991). In the song, the protagonist is leaving and vows to <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> time he spent with his lover. In 1993, Mexican singer-songwriter Cristian Castro covered the song on his album, Un Segundo en el Tiempo. Castro's version peaked at number-one on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart in the United States became his first number-one single.|$|E

500|$|... "Do or Die" [...] is an {{electronic}} rock song with influences and elements from arena rock. It {{opens with a}} female voiceover introducing the song's title in the Chinese language, after which there is {{an electronic}} introduction. This {{is followed by the}} sound of guitars, drum beats and synthesizers. After the first verse, the pre-chorus follows, with Leto voicing the line, [...] "I will <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> moment". The full-throated chorus then follows, which features heavy use of synthesizers and drums. The song includes a contribution from the band's fans, credited as the Knights of the White Shadow, who provide additional vocals recorded at the band's studio.|$|E
500|$|... "Revolver" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna, Carlos Battey, Steven Battey, Lil Wayne, Justin Franks and Brandon Kitchen, and {{produced}} by Madonna and DJ Frank E. In an interview with Hiphopupdate.com, Frank E recalled that {{he had gone to}} the recording session two hours before his scheduled meeting with Madonna to set up and give the audio files to the recording engineer, and he said that the ensuing wait was incredibly nerve-racking for him. After Madonna arrived, they recorded her vocals and the song was finished the next day. [...] Reminiscing about the session, he said: [...] "I will <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> feeling of leaving that session after vocal producing Madonna, and thinking to myself, 'It can’t it really get any harder than this.' I've taken that mentality into every other session I've been in, and it's helped me make the session and song more of a success. Unfortunately, the mix sounded like crap and the song flopped, but hey, you win some and you lose some." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Waterloo Record {{called the}} album [...] "...a sizzling {{collection}} of new tunes which {{rank among the}} band’s best." [...] Classic Rock Magazine said that [...] "Vagabond Bones rocks hard, but <b>never</b> <b>forgets</b> <b>the</b> value of a memorable chorus." ...|$|R

500|$|She {{had just}} taken on a steady job working for Marianne Faithfull and John Dunbar as the nanny to their little boy Nicholas, and it was while taking care of Nicholas in Marianne’s third floor Chelsea flat that she first {{encountered}} Paul McCartney. He buzzed the intercom to ask if John (Dunbar) was around, and when Paul explained who he was, Maggie invited him straight up. “Paul ran {{up the stairs and}} came in. Very casually I told him that John wasn’t really in and that sent us both into hysterics. We were laughing and chatting. I made a nice lunch for Marianne and a bunch of her friends but they never showed up. Paul and I sat together and ate it instead. I’ll <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> meal – it was chicken casserole. It was such a funny introduction that it threw us both off guard. It could have been very embarrassing, but there was an immediate rapport and we just couldn’t stop talking.” ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1910s, Sacramento County {{improved}} the county road along the levee of the Sacramento River between Sacramento and Rio Vista, which crossed the river twice on free ferries near Paintersville and Isleton. A toll ferry across the San Joaquin River connected Sherman Island, south of Rio Vista, with Antioch, where drivers could head west through the Broadway Tunnel {{to reach the}} San Francisco Bay, but the road between Rio Vista and the ferry was poor. In 1922, the Victory Highway Association selected this [...] "Netherlands Route" [...] (through what was locally promoted as the [...] "Netherlands of America") for the Victory Highway west of Sacramento, as it was both shorter than the Lincoln Highway route via Stockton and more scenic. In particular, the river district would [...] "impress [...] with the enormous productive resources of this state as well as supply him with an unmatched scenic drive", and the Broadway Tunnel approach to the bay would bring him [...] "over the Victory Highway {{to the end of}} his journey in such a fashion that he will <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> view spread before him as he first comes into sight of the San Francisco Bay region".|$|E
500|$|Walsingham {{was driven}} by Protestant zeal to counter Catholicism, and sanctioned the use of torture against Catholic priests and {{suspected}} conspirators. Edmund Campion was among those tortured and found guilty {{on the basis of}} extracted evidence; he was hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn in 1581. Walsingham could <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> atrocities against Protestants he had witnessed in France during the Bartholomew's Day massacre and believed a similar slaughter would occur in England {{in the event of a}} Catholic resurgence. Walsingham's brother-in-law Robert Beale, who was in Paris with Walsingham at the time of the massacre, encapsulated Walsingham's view: [...] "I think it time and more than time for us to awake out of our dead sleep, and take heed lest like mischief as has already overwhelmed the brethren and neighbours in France and Flanders embrace us which be left in such sort as we shall not be able to escape." [...] Walsingham tracked down Catholic priests in England and supposed conspirators by employing informers, and intercepting correspondence. Walsingham's staff in England included the cryptographer Thomas Phelippes, who was an expert in deciphering letters and forgery, and Arthur Gregory, who was skilled at breaking and repairing seals without detection.|$|E
