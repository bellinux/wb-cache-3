40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of four years of the authors’ research on music information retrieval (MIR), omitting technical details. An overview of terminology, music analysis techniques, and research done {{in the last five years}} is also provided. Some of the results achieved by the authors are summarized, for example distinguishing among several genres of music by automatic classification. However, the complete lack of detail in the discussion of MIR research limits the possibility of a deeper understanding of this subject. The paper continues with a section devoted to graphical user interfaces designed for browsing and interacting with audio collections. Last, the authors’ own system, MARSYAS, is introduced. Illustrative of the phase of development that MIR is in is the statement that a database of 1, 000 files is large; in the field of information retrieval, and even for content-based image and video retrieval, such a size is considered small. This illustrates that research toward MIR is still in its early years. Regrettably, no references are provided for the last three years. Nevertheless, for non-experts, this paper provides a <b>nice</b> and easy <b>introduction</b> to the field of MIR, offering some pointers for further reading, and providing a link to public license software...|$|R

5000|$|Kenn Scott {{described}} the album as: [...] "This one’s got the heaviest garage sound for the era, ‘Praise We The Lord’ probably being the closest Christian music ever {{got to the}} raw punk energy of early Who (it’s actually a rip-off of The Yardbird’s tune ‘You’re A Better Man Than I’). The irresistibly catchy twangy pop of ‘With The Lord At Our Side’ coupled with the Association-like title cut prove the band’s own compositions to be the best. Solidly electric sound throughout, plenty of riffs, solid drumming, some Duane Eddy-derived leads on beat interpretations of ‘Battle Hymn’ and ‘Onward Christian Soldiers’ that probably caused a few stirs among the ecclesia. For beat sounds {{this side of the}} Big Pond, this one’s the top banana. Both stereo and mono versions exist with subtle differences (note the two entirely different guitar solos on ‘With The Lord At Our Side’)". Another reviewer described this album: [...] "While this was clearly a secular album (as far as I’m aware one of the first major label releases clearly intended to tap the youth market), the mixture of traditional hymns and handful of originals were cloaked in an extremely mid-1960s pop and garage vibe. While the band didn’t seem to have a true lead singer (most of the songs have ‘group’ vocals), they boasted an accomplished lead guitarist in Altchular (‘Praise We the Lord’ served as a nice showcase for his chops), {{with the rest of the}} band also quite good. It sounds kind of strange, but given the band’s earnestness and talent, if you could overlook the occasionally cringe-inducing lyrics (check out ‘What Is Man’), tracks like ‘Little Drummer Boy‘, ’God Lives’ and ‘Praise We the Lord’ could easily have been confused for something by their better known non-secular competitors (think Tower label mates The Standells). Elsewhere harmony-rich pop tracks like ‘You'll Never Walk Alone’, ‘With the Lord On Your Side’ and ‘ Make a Joyful Noise’ bore more than a passing resemblance to The Association, while their covers of ‘Battle Hymn of the Republic’ and ‘Onward Christian Soldiers’ offered up a <b>nice</b> <b>introduction</b> to Duane Eddy-styled rock".Hi! I am Fred Barnett, and this is 2011. I just want everyone to know that much of this album was vocalized by studio musicians who sounded more like [...] "The Chipmunks" [...] than our actual band.

5000|$|All I Have {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic gave the album the grade {{of two and}} a half out of five stars, stating: [...] "The debut album by 22-year-old Amerie is basically a showcase for writer/producer Rich Harrison, who constructs a series of mid-tempo rhythm tracks and writes lyrics of romantic longing. Harrison's lack of originality is suggested by his inability even to come up with new song titles. Among the tracks here are newly written songs entitled [...] "Need You Tonight" [...] "Got to Be There" [...] and even [...] "I Just Died" [...] (that's right, [...] "in your arms"). Amerie has a pleasant-enough voice that she uses to express a tempered fervor and a degree of eroticism, but she seems to be just another modestly talented performer chosen mostly for her looks; record companies seem to be on an endless search for attractive young women of mixed racial heritage (apparently in hopes of demographic crossover) who can carry a tune, and this willing Georgetown graduate with a Korean mother and African-American father is just {{the latest in a long}} line. None of which is to say that she won't succeed (record companies make a lot of money taking such bets), but at least on the basis of her debut album, Amerie has nothing to recommend her beyond a fairly anonymous surface appeal." [...] Vanessa E. Jones of The Boston Globe gave a mixed review, stating: Amerie's almond eyes come courtesy of her Korean mother, while her caramel skin was inherited from her African-American dad. On her debut CD, All I Have, she proves that the melange makes a soulful combination. If there was a representative sound of the summer this year, it should have been the singer's shimmering single, [...] "Why Don't We Fall in Love". With jazzy horns and romantic strings caressed by Amerie's strong, yearning alto, the song brought to mind beach holidays and summer fun every time it came on the air. Amerie follows up that effort with a 12-song CD with several distinctive cuts. It would be a great debut if it weren't for all the filler, and for lyrics (written by the CD's producer Rich Harrison) that revolve around the tired subjects of love, betrayal, and hate. When Amerie fails to follow her instincts, the results can be disastrous. [...] "Float", for instance, finds her relying on histrionic yelling rather than crooning. But this is definitely a talent to watch, as the songs [...] "Can't Let Go", [...] "Talkin' to Me", [...] "Got to Be There" [...] and [...] "Why Don't We Fall in Love" [...] show." [...] Sarah Rodman of Boston Herald gave the album positive review with the grade of three out of four stars, stating: [...] "This 22-year-old Georgetown grad may be blessed with a lovely, flinty voice and great looks, but even she must have been shocked when her debut album, All I Have, made a Top 5 debut in Billboard. Amerie's music is two parts intriguing (a strong yet sultry R&B growl matched with the off-kilter hip-hop grooves of producer Rich Harrison) and one part run-of-the-mill (banal romance lyrics). There are tunes about Mr. Right, Mr. Right Now and Mr. Wrong. Amerie scores extra points for keeping things short, sweet and free from gratuitous vocal acrobatics. She stands out from the female R&B pack without resorting to affectation or gimmickry." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today gave the album {{two and a half}} out of four stars, stating: [...] "On her strings-laced hit single, [...] "Why Don't We Fall in Love", 22-year-old Amerie shows a talent for subtlety and nuance not often heard from a debut singer. The sultry vocalist lets the intensity build rather than relying on over-the-top flourishes. She shows her versatility with the jazzy [...] "Nothing Like Loving You", the edgy [...] "I Just Died" [...] and the infectious [...] "Talkin' to Me". While the material is not consistently strong, it serves as a <b>nice</b> <b>introduction</b> to a singer with great potential for growth." [...] Felicia Pride from PopMatters gave a mixed review, stating: [...] "I like Amerie. Not that she has much of an image, but she still seems like such a sweet and positive young woman. A Georgetown graduate, her humbleness exudes in interviews as she basks in her childhood dream with the giddiness of a schoolgirl. When her first single exploded, the world was introduced to her sitting on a park bench singing wholeheartedly those rhetorical words, [...] "Why don’t we fall in love?" [...] The hip-hop track with the defined R&B voice, championed upon the winning chemistry mastered by the likes of Mary J. Blige and Faith Evans. Naturally the anticipation was bubbling for her forthcoming All I Have. Even with all her charming characteristics, the brains, the voice and the looks, her debut is, well, boring. As I listened to the 12 tracks (11 if you dismiss the outro), I strained to find some spice, some personality. The tracks run into each other to the point that they become one very long song. The singular topic of love and relationships heightens its monotony, as does her lack of serious vocal experimentation. If you thought she sounded a little flat on [...] "Why Don’t We Fall in Love", prepare yourself for a few more out of range notes. The album is by no means Pretty Girl Who Can't Sing revisited. It is worth the space in your CD collection, and has some bright moments. In terms of mood, it’s very laid-back, with a rainy day or I-just-fell-in-love vibe, and one you can listen to at work. I must warn that you have already heard the most animated track on the album and probably more times than you would’ve liked as her first single was definitely killed by the radio. Her second single, [...] "Talkin’ to Me" [...] is cute, and a little catchy, but a little personality deficient. The songs that really carry the album are [...] "I Just Died" [...] and [...] "Show Me". Both are quiet storm ballads in which her vocals are richer, not as forced (quieter) and dance hand-in-hand with sexy hooks that allow the track to take the lead. The title track [...] "All I Have" [...] would have made a better second single as it shows the potential that Amerie has to explore the love ballad, the real meat and potatoes of the album. Props should go to Rich Harrison who is largely responsible for this project. He performed all the instruments, and wrote and produced all the songs except the outro. Besides being crazy talented, he is certainly a man in tune with his emotions, writing highly sensitive and female-perceptive lyrics perfect for any R&B diva. His tracks are simple yet artful and truly designed to let the singer define them. Unfortunately, this was not a consistent trend on All I Have because Amerie’s vocals were not always compelling enough to fittingly dominate the track. There were times when all was lost. For her first run, it might have been in the label’s best interest to employ a few hit makers. You know the ones that can make a hit for anyone despite their vocal capability. Not saying that Amerie is without, it just might have added a little pizzazz if she would have joined the Jermaine Dupri or even Darkchild roster list. But maybe that is what remixes are for. In her bio, Amerie proudly (as she should be) describes her debut, [...] "The music and lyrics really put you into a zone. When Rich Harrison and I began creating the record, we knew that fusing beautiful melodies with hard, hip-hop beats would move people. I think we’ve accomplished that." [...] I only wish. Well maybe next time—and hopefully there will be another time. Her debut was respectable, simple and unpretentious. The ingredients are there, she just needs to perfect the mix." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{feature of}} many systems of partial differential equations in two variables {{that arise in}} geometry and mechanics is their explicit solvability based on some symmetries or a nonlinear transformation of variables. Such integrable systems include the Korteweg-de-Vries equation, harmonic maps from a sphere to a Lie group, minimal surfaces and certain other conformal constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces, the two dimensional Toda lattice, and the chiral model from physics. The notion of an integrable system is frequently not defined precisely but rather is characterized generally by various inter-related common features including the action of a large Lie group of symmetries to give some algebraic solvability, space-localized solutions (solitons), a nonlinear change of variables transforming to linear equations, solutions generated by a Hamiltonian flow, and a transformation of a solution to a conjugate solution.

It re‡ects that LS problems {{are by far the}} most common case for unconstrained optimization. See also N&W, p. 245 – 250 for typical examples of LS problems. Least Square problems have often their origin in …tting models to observations. In its simplest form, we know this from the problem of …tting a regression line, y = ax + b, through a set of data points fxi; yig; i = 1;; N. When N> 2, it is in general impossible to put the line through all points, but we try to determine an optimal line, for example by determining the pair fa; b g which minimizes the objective function f(a; b) = NX (axi + b yi) 2 : (1) i= 1 In this simple case, it is easy to derive the solution analytically, but in general the solution has to be found numerically. Since these problems are so common, {{there has been a lot}} of wor...|$|E
40|$|This book is an {{important}} monograph for those working on the related structural chemistry of the weak hydrogen bond. It has about 1000 citations. A large number of stick and ball structures are given in the book, depicting the hydrogen bonds and their environments in crystals. Other books, particularly several recently published ones on the hydrogen bond are recommended on page 4. Chapter 1 gives a brief and very <b>nice</b> <b>introduction</b> to the historical background and definition of the hydrogen bond {{in general and the}} weak hydrogen bond in particular. Personally I am fascinated by the hydrogen bond topic because of my great interest in entropy concepts. Pauling's paper on residual entropy of ice [1] is famous as it used the name hydrogen bond for its first time, as also pointed out in this book. In this paper [1] Pauling elegantly applied his resonance concept to the structure of ice. In German speaking countries, chemists normally use "H-Brücke " (H bridge) instead of hydrogen bond. The authors commented that "the use of the word bridge is hardly objectionable. " Normally weak hydrogen bonds are of-C-H⋅⋅⋅X type, where the H donor is from a CH of-C-H, while the normal, typical hydrogen bond has-O-H and-N-H, etc., as H donors. If the acceptor is a structural moiety with several centers, the hydrogen bond is called non-conventional. In some cases...|$|E

It has been also been a topic of debate as to what is an ideal code generator and how an ideal code generator can be created. The biggest challenge while creating a code generator is to maintain a balance between the amount of freedom given to the user and the restrictions imposed on the code generated. These two seemed to be very conflicting requirements while designing the Automated RTL Code Generator. If the code generator tries to be rigid and sticks to well-defined paths and restricted code, the flexibility provided to the also reduces. It is a very interesting task to strike the right amount of balance and generate code of high quality and well-defined standards. Verilog code is a type of RTL (Register Transfer Level) that itself has fewer constructs and variety as compared to pure software languages like Java, or Python so it makes sense to generate it automatically so that the hardware designers are relieved from the mundane tasks of writing repetitive verilog code modules. Also code generator provides a <b>nice</b> <b>introduction</b> to the much wider topic of compiler design. This project also tries to delve deeper into the latest IPXACT XML standard IEEE 1865 - 2009 which is used for hardware description and will provide means of generating verilog code directly from it...|$|E
40|$|The multivariate {{regression}} model Y = XB +U expresses each row Yi · ∈ R p as a linear combination Xi·B of the q columns of X, plus some mean-zero random error Ui·. Perhaps fewer than q terms would suffice to predict Y adequately or, more realistically, perhaps some number m < q of linear combinations of the columns of X would suffice. That {{is the essence}} of Factor Analysis, a method proposed in 1904 by psychologist Charles Spearman in his effort to show that all measures of mental ability (mathematical skill, vocabulary, other verbal skills, artistic skills, logical reasoning ability, etc.) could be explained by a single quantity he called g for “general intelligence” (also the idea behind IQ). The same goal comes up in many application areas — to explain some rather large number q of measurements in terms of a much smaller number m. An extreme example of recent importance is the search for “genes ” within DNA sequence data where q might be many thousands, much larger than the number n of subjects — a challenge for the traditional multivariate tools, leading to the development of “data mining” methodology. The simplest possibility would be for most of the variability of Xi · to be explained by a linear relation to a small number m of “factors, ” an idea we now pursue.
