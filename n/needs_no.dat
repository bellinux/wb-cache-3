25|$|The main {{advantage}} of an electromagnet over a permanent magnet is that the magnetic field can be quickly changed by controlling the amount of electric current in the winding. However, unlike a permanent magnet that <b>needs</b> <b>no</b> power, an electromagnet requires a continuous supply of current to maintain the magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|A crystal radio receiver, {{also called}} a crystal set or cat's whisker receiver, {{is a very}} simple radio receiver, popular {{in the early days}} of radio. It <b>needs</b> <b>no</b> other power source but that {{received}} solely from the power of radio waves received by a wire antenna. It gets its name from its most important component, known as a crystal detector, originally made from a piece of crystalline mineral such as galena. This component is now called a diode.|$|E

25|$|There can be {{no doubt}} the NSW men are {{improving}} a good deal... They cannot be blamed for the farce, for it was nothing else. If the Australian team depends on Queenslanders to strengthen it, one is afraid it will be found wanting. They are quite the weakest lot of footballers I have even seen come down from Queensland. The play <b>needs</b> <b>no</b> detailed description as it was simply a practice match for NSW, and certainly did not advantageously advertise the new game.|$|E
25|$|Baxter {{is a new}} robot {{introduced}} in 2012 which learns by guidance. A worker could teach Baxter how to perform a task by moving its hands in the desired motion and having Baxter memorize them. Extra dials, buttons, and controls are available on Baxter's arm for more precision and features. Any regular worker could program Baxter and it only takes a matter of minutes, unlike usual industrial robots that take extensive programs and coding {{in order to be}} used. This means Baxter <b>needs</b> <b>no</b> programming in order to operate. No software engineers are needed. This also means Baxter can be taught to perform multiple, more complicated tasks. Sawyer was added in 2015 for smaller, more precise tasks.|$|E
25|$|Smoke {{contains}} several carcinogenic pyrolytic {{products that}} bind to DNA and cause genetic mutations. Particularly potent carcinogens are {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAH), which are toxicated to mutagenic epoxides. The first PAH {{to be identified as}} a carcinogen in tobacco smoke was benzopyrene, which has been shown to toxicate into an epoxide that irreversibly attaches to a cell's nuclear DNA, which may either kill the cell or cause a genetic mutation. If the mutation inhibits programmed cell death, the cell can survive to become a cancer cell. Similarly, acrolein, which is abundant in tobacco smoke, also irreversibly binds to DNA, causes mutations and thus also cancer. However, it <b>needs</b> <b>no</b> activation to become carcinogenic.|$|E

25|$|The space-based portion {{will not}} need to support itself against gravity (other than {{relatively}} weak tidal stresses). It <b>needs</b> <b>no</b> protection from terrestrial wind or weather, but will {{have to cope with}} space hazards such as micrometeors and solar flares. Two basic methods of conversion have been studied: photovoltaic (PV) and solar dynamic (SD). Most analyses of SBSP have focused on photovoltaic conversion using solar cells that directly convert sunlight into electricity. Solar dynamic uses mirrors to concentrate light on a boiler. The use of solar dynamic could reduce mass per watt. Wireless power transmission was proposed early on as a means to transfer energy from collection to the Earth's surface, using either microwave or laser radiation at a variety of frequencies.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "no {{decompression}}", or [...] "no stop" [...] dive is a dive that <b>needs</b> <b>no</b> decompression stops {{during the}} ascent {{according to the}} chosen algorithm or tables, and relies on a controlled ascent rate {{for the elimination of}} excess inert gases. In effect, the diver is doing continuous decompression during the ascent.|$|E

500|$|In 2016, {{around the}} 10th {{anniversary of the}} film's release, Vanity Fair did a rundown of some Independence Day weekend movie box results from the {{previous}} 15 years, noting how some better-remembered films had been bested by films that have not {{stood the test of}} time. It called Superman Returns win over The Devil Wears Prada the [...] "most ironic" [...] of these victories.

500|$|Known as a [...] "wash and wear" [...] dog, the Australian Cattle Dog {{requires}} little grooming, and {{an occasional}} brushing {{is all that is}} required to keep the coat clean and odour-free. Even for the show ring it <b>needs</b> <b>no</b> more than wiping down with a moist cloth. It is not a year-round shedder but blows its coat once a year (twice in the case of intact females) and frequent brushing and a warm bath during this period will contain the shedding hair. As with all dogs, regular attention to nails, ears and teeth will help avoid health problems.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of Milford's biography, {{scholars}} and critics began to look at Zelda's work in a new light. In a 1968 edition of Save Me the Waltz, F. Scott Fitzgerald scholar Matthew Bruccoli wrote, [...] "Save Me the Waltz is worth reading partly because anything that illuminates the career of F. Scott Fitzgerald is worth reading—and {{because it is the}} only published novel of a brave and talented woman who is remembered for her defeats." [...] But as Save Me the Waltz was increasingly read alongside Milford's biography, a new perspective emerged. In 1979, scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin wrote rebutting Bruccoli's position: [...] "Save Me the Waltz is a moving and fascinating novel which should be read on its own terms equally as much as Tender Is the Night. It <b>needs</b> <b>no</b> other justification than its comparative excellence." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Mullum Malarum {{was passed}} by the Central Board of Film Certification on 4 August 1978, there were {{problems}} with its release. After Kamal Haasan's intervention, it was released on 15 August, India's Independence Day. The film's commercial performance during its first few weeks was poor. Chettiar, who despaired of the film's success and thought he was [...] "doomed", refused to underwrite any more publicity: [...] "A good product <b>needs</b> <b>no</b> publicity, whereas a bad product cannot be pushed in the market however much you publicise it". During its third or fourth week of release, positive magazine reviews and word of mouth spread; Mullum Malarum became a commercial success, with a 100-day theatrical run. Chettiar apologised to Mahendran and offered him a blank cheque, to which he politely refused. The director instead thanked him for [...] "letting him make a movie with Rajinikanth".|$|E
500|$|In early 2012, Loder made a {{music video}} for [...] "Your Love Alone", {{one of the}} album's tracks, which was {{uploaded}} to YouTube. She later said she had written the song during a difficult phase in her life, and the song's lyrics revolve around {{the idea that the}} grace and mercy of God {{can be found in the}} most difficult situations. Through her experience, she became convinced that knowing God is all-important, expressing this concept in the chorus: [...] "Your love alone is sufficient. It <b>needs</b> <b>no</b> company." [...] She stated that she wrote the song [...] "One Name Away" [...] after having watched The Tyra Banks Show. The episode featured an interview with a girl who had been forced into prostitution at a young age; despite smiling on screen, the girl hopelessly declared that she would probably die before she turned 22.|$|E
500|$|One {{role that}} was not {{difficult}} to cast was Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty, the violent yet thoughtful leader of the replicants. Scott cast Hauer without having met him, based solely on Hauer's performances in Paul Verhoeven's movies Scott had seen (Katie Tippel, Soldier of Orange and Turkish Delight). Hauer's portrayal of Batty was regarded by Philip K. Dick as, [...] "the perfect Batty—cold, Aryan, flawless". Of the many films Hauer has made, Blade Runner is his favorite. As he explained in a live chat in 2001, [...] "Blade Runner <b>needs</b> <b>no</b> explanation. It just [...] All of the best. There is nothing like it. To {{be part of a}} real masterpiece which changed the world's thinking. It's awesome." [...] Hauer rewrote his character's [...] "tears in rain" [...] speech himself and presented the words to Scott on set prior to filming.|$|E
