40|$|Our {{objective}} was to study the prevalence of <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases</b> in Chinese children. A prospective study of <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases</b> in Chinese children was conducted from 1985 to 2001 in Hong Kong, which is a city in southern China. The population census of June 30, 2001, was {{used to calculate the}} prevalence of <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases</b> in Chinese children. Altogether, 332 children aged < 19 years at first assessment with <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases</b> confirmed by using electromyography, muscle biopsy, and/or molecular genetic study were included in the study. Of these, 228 (68 %) had inherited and 104 (32 %) had noninherited <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases.</b> Of the inherited <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases,</b> the most common were the dystrophinopathies, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (n = 66) and Becker muscular dystrophy (n = 8). Spinal muscular atrophy was the second most common (n = 61). Of the noninherited neuromuscular disorders, myasthenia gravis was the most common (n = 62, 60 %). Nearly 88 % of the cases of myasthenia gravis were ocular type. The prevalence rate of <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases</b> in June 2001 (n = 291 surviving) is estimated to be 214 × 10 - 6. The estimated prevalence rate of <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases</b> in our Chinese children is 1 in 4669. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the number of employed people in a group of patients with <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases</b> and in 3 separate subgroups (facioscapulo-humeral dystrophy, hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, and myotonic dystrophy) to investigate any differences in employment status between the patient groups, and to identify factors related to employment status. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PATIENTS: A total of 591 patients with <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases</b> participated in the study, 138 with facioscapulo-humeral dystrophy, 135 with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, and 318 with myotonic dystrophy. METHODS: Self-report questionnaires, the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS) and the Short Form- 36 (SF- 36). RESULTS: Of the patients with <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases</b> in the study, 56. 7 % were employed. Younger age, being male, and higher education contributed significantly to employment status of the <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases</b> group and the hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy and myotonic dystrophy subgroups. Significant between-group differences for employed vs not employed subjects were present in the total <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases</b> group on all subscales of the CIS and SF- 36. Factors related to employment status differed for the 3 <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases</b> subgroups. CONCLUSION: More than half of the patients with <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases</b> were employed. Patients with facioscapulo-humeral dystrophy and patients with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy were more often employed than patients with myotonic dystrophy. Between-group analyses for differences in baseline factors revealed 11 significant factors related to employment.

25|$|Muscle {{strength}} testing {{can be used}} {{to determine}} the presence of a <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>disease,</b> but cannot determine its cause.

25|$|Myasthenia gravis is a <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>disease</b> {{leading to}} {{fluctuating}} muscle weakness and fatigability during simple activities. Weakness is typically caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the post-synaptic neuromuscular junction, inhibiting the stimulative {{effect of the}} neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Myasthenia is treated with immunosuppressants, cholinesterase inhibitors and, in selected cases, thymectomy.|$|E
25|$|Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a {{long-term}} <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>disease</b> that leads to varying degrees of skeletal muscle weakness.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Neuromuscular</b> <b>Diseases</b> are a {{heterogeneous}} molecular, clinical and prognosis group. Progress {{has been achieved}} in the understanding and classification of these diseases. Cardiac involvement in <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases</b> namely conduction disorders, ventricular dilatation and dilated cardiomyopathy with its impact on prognosis, is often dissociated from the peripheral myopathy. Therefore, close surveillance is mandatory in the affected patients. In this context, preventive therapy (beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) has been recently recommended in the most common <b>Neuromuscular</b> <b>Diseases,</b> Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Myotonic Dystrophy. Key Words: Muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy, sudden cardiac death...|$|R
40|$|<b>Neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases</b> are inherited, chronic, {{degenerative}} and progressive. The {{main characteristics}} of <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases</b> are: muscular weakness, contractures, scoliosis, respiratory insufficiency, cardiac affection, nutrition disturbances, {{dependence on the}} help of others, possible social isolation and physiological problems. Appropriate rehabilitation programs should influence all mentioned characteristics. A special unit for rehabilitation of patients with <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases</b> within the Institute for rehabilitation of the Republic of Slovenia was established in 1993 at the initiative of the Muscular Dystrophy Association of Slovenia. The main aim of this establishment {{was to try to}} guide the patient and his family through the course of the disease. The article describes the work of the mentioned unit.

2500|$|Mitochondrial {{diseases}} are sometimes (about 15% of the time) caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA that affect mitochondrial function.

Mitochondrial diseases take on unique characteristics both {{because of the way}} the diseases are often inherited and because mitochondria are so critical to cell function. The subclass of these diseases that have <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>disease</b> symptoms are often called a mitochondrial myopathy.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two ways}} to {{classify}} <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases.</b> The first relies on its mechanism of action, or how the action of the diseases affects normal functioning (whether it is through mutations in genes or more direct pathways such as poisoning).

40|$|We {{investigated}} the immunohistochemical distribution of cytoskeletal proteins in smooth muscles of 15 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), 8 patients with Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), 28 patients with various <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases,</b> and 2 normal controls, performing skin and muscle biopsies. Dystrophin immunostaining confirmed absent {{reaction in the}} arrector pili muscles of DMD patients, faint positive reaction in BMD patients, and strong dystrophin reaction in patients with other <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases</b> and normal controls. Immunostaining of utrophin was positive with variable intensity in the arrector pili muscles in all DMD patients. In BMD patients, utrophin was faintly expressed in the arrector pili muscles in 2 cases, and negative in the other 5 patients. In the other cases of <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases</b> and in normal controls, immunostaining for utrophin was negative in the arrector pili muscles. Staining of the capillary endothelial cells and muscular vessel walls was seen in normal controls, {{as well as in}} DMD, BMD, and other <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases.</b> Vinculin, vimentin and desmin were expressed both in arrector pili smooth muscles and in vessel walls of patients with dystrophinopathy and other <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases,</b> as well as in normal controls. Thus utrophin is normally expressed in the smooth muscle of the vessels and its expression does not vary in <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>diseases.</b> On the contrary, in the arrector pili smooth muscle utrophin is not expressed in normal controls but it is in dystrophinopathies, paralleling the findings in striated muscle, which expresses utrophin in a reciprocal manner with respect to dystrophin...|$|R
