25|$|The impulse of the Moravian Church {{after its}} renewal at Herrnhut was to evangelise. This did not entail {{proselytising}} from other churches.

500|$|On 22 October 2013, Warner Bros. {{released}} a deluxe edition of Moondance.

The packaging included a linen-wrapped folio and a booklet with liner notes written by Scheiner and music journalist Alan Light. The deluxe reissue was met with widespread critical acclaim; Record Collector called it an aural [...] "marvel", while The Independent said the remastering [...] "strips away centuries of digital compression and makes the music sound as if you've <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> properly". In Rolling Stone, Will Hermes felt the numerous outtakes possessed an intimate quality that compensated for lacking the [...] "sublime, brassy" [...] arrangements featured on {{the final version of}} Morrison's [...] "jazzy-pop masterpiece".|$|E

Amy Reiter of Los Angeles Times noted that [...] "her clear, crisp tone, crashed and burned on 'Honesty,' missing notes and losing her way". Laura Prudom of The Huffington Post was mixed about her performance writing, [...] "She was occasionally pitchy on this song, and seemed to be overthinking it in parts and allowing the song to overwhelm her... Unusually, she seemed both nasal and pitchy in the early parts of the performance... her choice of a pantsuit was completely baffling, since it made her look nearer 40 than 20." [...] Later, during an interview, Cavanagh revealed that she had difficulties singing the song because she had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> before.|$|E

500|$|A third {{account was}} made by a private named John Shaw who was in Washington's regiment, but not present at the affair. [...] His account, based on {{detailed}} accounts from others who were present, was made in a sworn statement on August 21; the details on Tanacharison's role in the affair are confirmed in a newspaper account printed on June 27. [...] In his account, the French were surrounded while some still slept. [...] Alerted by a noise, one of the Frenchmen [...] "fired a Gun upon which Col. Washington gave the Word for all his Men to fire. [...] Several of them being killed, the rest betook themselves to flight, but our Indians haveing gone round the French ... they fled back to the English and delivered up their Arms ...

500|$|The album's cover art (known as the 'Screaming Elf') is a {{distorted}} {{photograph of the}} band members, photographed by Kevin Westenberg, above {{a black and white}} upside-down burning forest. Concerning the artwork, Cornell said, [...] "Superunknown relates to birth in a way... Being born or even dying—getting flushed into something that you know nothing about. The hardest thing is to nail down a visual image to put on a title like that. The first thing we thought of was a forest in grey or black. Soundgarden has always been associated with images of flowers and lush colors and this was the opposite. It still seemed organic but it was very dark and cold... I was into those stories as a kid where forests were full of evil and scary things as opposed to being happy gardens that you go camping in." [...] In a 1994 Pulse! magazine interview, Cornell said that the inspiration for the album's title came from his misreading of a video entitled Superclown. He added, [...] "I thought it was a cool title. I'd <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> before, never saw it before, and it inspired me." [...] The album also saw a limited release on 12" [...] colored vinyl (blue, orange, and clear), as a double-LP in a gatefold sleeve. The album's title 'SUPERUNKNOWN' is sometimes displayed with the [...] "UNKNOWN" [...] as semi upside down and reversed lettering (stylized as [...] "SUPER∩ИKИOWИ").|$|E

2500|$|Textbooks and {{dictionaries}} {{indicate the}} length of vowels by putting a macron or horizontal bar above the long vowel, {{but it is not}} generally done in regular texts. Occasionally, mainly in early printed texts up to the 18th century, one may see a circumflex used to indicate a long vowel where this makes a difference to the sense, for instance Româ [...] ('from Rome' ablative) compared to Roma [...] ('Rome' nominative). Sometimes, for instance in Roman Catholic service books, an acute accent over a vowel is used to indicate the stressed syllable. It would be [...] redundant for one who knew the classical rules of accentuation and made the correct distinction between long and short vowels, but most Latin speakers since the 3rd century have not made any distinction between long and short vowels, but they have kept the accents in the same places; thus, the use of accent marks allows speakers to read a word aloud correctly even if they <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> spoken aloud.|$|E
2500|$|Lighthouse {{design was}} the family's profession: Thomas's father (Robert's grandfather) was the famous civil {{engineer}} Robert Stevenson, {{and both of}} Thomas's brothers (Robert's uncles) Alan and David, {{were in the same}} field. Indeed, even Thomas's maternal grandfather, Thomas Smith, had been in the same profession. However, Robert's mother's family were not of the same profession. Margaret's natal family, the Balfours, were gentry, tracing their lineage back to a certain Alexander Balfour who had held the lands of Inchyra in Fife in the fifteenth century. Margaret's father, Lewis Balfour (1777–1860), was a minister of the Church of Scotland at nearby Colinton, and her siblings included the physician George William Balfour and the marine engineer James Balfour. Stevenson spent the greater part of his boyhood holidays in his maternal grandfather's house. [...] "Now I often wonder," [...] wrote Stevenson, [...] "what I inherited from this old minister. I must suppose, indeed, that he was fond of preaching sermons, and so am I, though I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> maintained that either of us loved to hear them." ...|$|E

2500|$|While fraggingthe {{assassination}} of unpopular officers by their subordinatesis generally {{associated with the}} Vietnam War, incidents of this nature occurred during the Civil War as well. Private Matthews speaks of a [...] "Lieut. Col. [...] Keep" [...] in the 3rd Confederate Infantry Regiment, whom he describes as a [...] "tyrant." [...] Keep {{was viewed as a}} martinet by his men after he punished them by ordering them to carry heavy fence rails or wooden poles as they marched; Matthews reports that his soldiers promised that he would not survive his first engagement. Although they did not manage to kill him, they were overjoyed to learn of Keep's departure after the battle. With regard to his own unit, Matthews says: [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> rumored that any of our officers of the 33rd Alabama were ever shot by any of our men intentionally, for there were no tyrannical officers such as Colonel Keep in the regiment." [...] He says that discontented men who did not believe that they could [...] "get justice" [...] from their regimental officers were usually able to obtain a transfer to another unit.|$|E
2500|$|Vliet {{was forced}} to quickly form a new Magic Band to {{complete}} support-tour dates, with musicians who had no experience with his music and in fact had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it.</b> Having {{no knowledge of the}} previous Magic Band style, they simply improvised what they thought would go with each song, playing much slicker versions that have been described as [...] "bar band" [...] versions of Beefheart songs. A review described this incarnation of the Magic Band as the [...] "Tragic Band", a term that has stuck over the years. Mike Barnes said that the description of the new band [...] "grooving along pleasantly", was [...] "...an appropriately banal description of the music of a man who {{only a few years ago}} composed with the expressed intent of shaking listeners out of their torpor". The one album they recorded, Bluejeans & Moonbeams (1974) has, like its predecessor, a completely different, almost soft rock sound from any other Beefheart record. Neither was well received; drummer Art Tripp recalled that when he and the original Magic Band listened to Unconditionally Guaranteed, they [...] "...were horrified. As we listened, it was as though each song was worse than the one which preceded it". Beefheart later disowned both albums, calling them [...] "horrible and vulgar", asking that they not be considered part of his musical output and urging fans who bought them to [...] "take copies back for a refund".|$|E
