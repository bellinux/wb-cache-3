40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a very marked {{increase}} in the number of transnational pairings in Italy. In this paper the authors describe the growing demographic trends concerning the transnational couples and their changing characteristics in terms of assortative mating, mainly using censuses and other official data, while survey micro data are used in order to highlight the mechanisms by which mixed couples are formed, their criteria of mate selection, and their family and fertility behaviour. The specificities of heterogamous unions that distinguish them from couples formed by partners of the same <b>nationality</b> (<b>Italian</b> and/or foreign) are examined with the help of multivariate analysis. The results show the existence of characteristics that are to be ascribed to the condition of ethnic heterogamy, net of other covariates, such as greater fragility and internal conflict, unconventional behavioural patterns, lower and later fertility. The knowledge obtained from the examination of these questions represents a useful glance in a particular path to integration of foreign communities in Italy and a useful basis for policy interventions in this sector...|$|E
40|$|This EuroBroadMap {{working paper}} is issued {{from the final}} report of the work package 3 (migrants and borders). To explore, reveal and analyse the Argentinian's {{representations}} of Europe, a qualitative survey was conducted with : candidates for a European nationality, people standing for emigrate, and Argentinian migrants settled in Spain and France from 2000 s. Indeed, the crisis of corralito (2001) {{has led to a}} strong wave of migration, especially to Spain. This migration is part of the particular history of Argentina : Argentina was a Spanish colony and a land of an important European emigration in the 19 th and early 20 th century. Now, Argentina holds a special place in the North-South international relations. Argentinian national history meets singular family histories of descendants of European migrants. Thus, we analyse the administrative trajectories of Argentinians who want to get a European <b>nationality.</b> <b>Italian</b> and Spanish legislation offer this option to the descendants of their former national who has emigrated to Argentina. Holding a European passport allows free circulation through the world. Migrant experiences are an opportunity to reconstruct family ties with Europe. It also revive the images and sentiments about Europe, forged in school and through the media. If Europe, particularly Spain, is seen as relatively close and attractive, it also draws a positive opposite of the Argentinian crisis. But Europe is seen in a more ambivalent way : a negative vision can be explained by various obstacles (during the administrative phase and during the migration). Indeed, the stories change progressively during the stages of migration : personal projects are redefined downward. Furthermore, the European vision is awakened by restrictive rights for undocumented migrants and racism and xenophobia. To concluded, Spanish crisis (2007 -) is reconfiguring, once again, family memories, identifications, projects and performances...|$|E
