25|$|This engine finally {{allowed the}} Defender to cruise comfortably at high speeds, {{as well as}} tow heavy loads speedily on hills while still being economical. In theory it only {{replaced}} the older Diesel Turbo engine in the range, with the other four-cylinder engines (and the V8 petrol engine) still being available. However, the Tdi's combination of performance and economy meant that it took {{the vast majority of}} sales. Exceptions were the British Army and some commercial operators, who continued to buy vehicles with the 2.5-litre <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> (in the army's case, this was because the Tdi was unable to be fitted with a 24volt generator). Small numbers of V8-engined Defenders were sold to users in countries with low fuel costs or who required as much power as possible (such as in Defenders used as fire engines and ambulances).|$|E
25|$|Land Rover Defender {{vehicles}} {{have been}} used by many of the world's military forces, including the US in some limited capacity, following experience with the vehicle during the first Gulf War, where US forces found the British Army's vehicles to be more capable and better suited to operation in urban areas and for air-lifting than the Humvee. (See U.S. Army Ranger Special Operations Vehicle.) The British Army has used Land Rovers since the 1950s, as have many countries in the Commonwealth of Nations. The British Army replaced its Series III fleet with One Tens in 1985, with a smaller fleet of Nineties following in 1986.

5000|$|In June 1986 the Delica {{underwent}} {{its third}} full model change. More aerodynamic than previous versions, its monocoque body and extensive safety features proved {{very popular in}} Japan's fast-growing recreational vehicle market segment.

50|$|A {{turbocharged}} {{version of}} the 22R-E engine (the 22R-TE) was also introduced in 1986, although this engine is significantly rarer than the base 22R-E. It appears that all turbocharged 4Runner models sold in the US were equipped with an automatic transmission, though a five-speed manual could still be ordered in the turbocharged pickups. Most turbocharged 4Runners were equipped with the SR5 package, and all turbo trucks had as standard a heavier rear differential later used in the V6 model. Low-option models had a small light in the gauge cluster to indicate turbo boost, while more plush vehicles were equipped with an all-digital gauge cluster that included a boost gauge. Turbocharged and <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engines</b> were also available in the pickups at this time as well, {{but it appears that}} no diesel-powered 4Runners were imported to the United States.|$|R

50|$|This has {{the effect}} that a {{turbocharger}} delivers boost, thus increasing power (and fuel consumption) only when such a power increase is demanded by putting the engine under a heavy load. A turbodiesel-powered vehicle accelerating from rest, for example, will put its engine under a heavy load, thus causing high boost pressures to be delivered by the turbocharger. This is detected by the fuel injection system which delivers more fuel to provide more power. Once the vehicle reaches a constant speed and constant engine rpm, the load decreases significantly, and {{the pressure of the}} exhaust gases through the turbo drop. Boost and fuel delivery decrease, thus lowering fuel consumption to near the same levels as a <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engine.</b> If, say, the vehicle starts climbing a gradient, the engine load increases and the turbocharger and fuel system provide more power. Extra fuel is delivered only when needed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe article {{presents}} the results of developing software for calculation and optimization of diesel operating processes and fuel injection.

The software consists of related modules: user interface for data input, running control and calculation results display, data exchange between modules, a module for one-dimensional calculation of processes in the common rail fuel systems, a module for thermodynamic calculation of operational processes and conjugate calculation of the thermal state of combustion chamber parts using finite element method, a module for three-dimensional calculation and optimization of operations in the combustion chamber using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) method. A distinctive feature of the software is a conjugate calculation of fuel injection, operational processes, and thermal state of the combustion chamber parts. The use of this software can significantly reduce the time required to optimize operational processes, solve problems of engine forcing, reduce fuel consumption and reduce emission rates...|$|R
5000|$|The three-cylinder (and some {{two-cylinder}} versions as well) {{continued in}} production until 1993, and this range was also available with a [...] diesel {{version of the}} 1-litre engine. The diesel looked the same, inside and out, as did the regular Minitre. At the time of introduction (April 1984), this engine {{was not only the}} smallest passenger car diesel in the world, but also had the highest specific output of any <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> in series production - it thus made for a surprisingly spirited performer. Introduced {{as part of an effort}} to bring Innocenti production above the threshold of profitability, around 20,000 cars annually, the Minidiesel sold very well. The diesel took thirty percent of the overall production with nearly no negative effect on sales of the petrol versions, a considerably bigger share than the expected twenty percent. It was helped by a lack of real competitors - by 1988 it still only had to compete with the 1.3 litre Fiat Uno and Panda diesels, as well as the Volkswagen Polo diesel, all of which were in a higher tax bracket and had higher fuel consumption.|$|E
50|$|The tractor was {{manufactured}} in 1962, its basic design {{has been adopted}} in several subsequent models. The K-700s were also exported to the Comecon member‚ÄîGDR imported K-700s starting from year 1968. The K-700 is a heavy four-wheel drive tractor-pulling force of 50 kN-class articulated and disconnectable rear wheel drive. The connecting piece of {{the front and rear}} frame part is movable about the vertical and the longitudinal axis, the steering takes place by lateral bending by means of hydraulic. It is powered by an 8-cylinder turbo diesel engine in V configuration with 215 HP. The K-700 1975 was the further development of K-700 A, including the disposal of the next larger fuel tanks (two tanks of 320 liter capacity) due to larger tires for better traction on. The K-700 A provided only a temporary solution. Also in 1975 a successor of K-700 appeared: the K-701. The K-701 has a 12-cylinder <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> with 300 HP. The K-700 tractors were reliable, efficient, particularly large sized, handle well although the noise and vibration load on the driver was relatively high.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{deals with}} usage of linear {{regression}} (LR) and {{artificial neural network}} (ANN) modeling to predict engine performance; torque and exhaust emissions; and carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen (CO, NOx) of a <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> fueled with standard diesel, peanut biodiesel (PME) and biodiesel-alcohol (EME, MME, PME) mixtures. Experimental work was conducted to obtain data to train and test the models. Backpropagation algorithm {{was used as a}} learning algorithm of ANN in the multilayered feedforward networks. Engine speed (rpm) and fuel properties, cetane number (CN), lower heating value (LHV) and density (œÅ) were used as input parameters in order to predict performance and emission parameters. It was shown that while linear regression modeling approach was deficient to predict desired parameters, more accurate results were obtained with the usage of ANN...|$|E
40|$|Rape-seed {{biodiesel}} is {{an interesting}} option {{to address the problem}} of decreasing availability of conventional fossil fuels, as well as to reduce the CO 2 emissions of internal combustion engines. The present paper describes an experimental campaign carried out on a current production 4 -cylinder, 4 -stroke <b>naturally</b> <b>aspirated</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engine,</b> running on standard diesel fuel and on three different blends of rape-seed biodiesel (20 %- 50 %- 100 %). Performance, emissions and in-cylinder pressure traces were measured at full load. It was found that the influence of rape-seed biodiesel in the fuel blend is not constant at each operating condition. However, as the biodiesel content increases, full load performance tends to drop, in particular brake specific fuel consumption (maximum worsening: + 18 %), while soot emission goes down. The maximum improvement observed in terms of soot concentration is 37. 5 %, at 1200 rpm. The combustion analysis revealed that the main differences among the fuels occur in the first phase of combustion: the burn rate is slower for biodiesel blends at low speeds, and faster at high...|$|E
