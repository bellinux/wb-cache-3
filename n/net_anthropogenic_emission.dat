Thus, this study was {{conducted}} with the aim of presenting the methodology developed to inventory the estimated <b>net</b> <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> of carbon dioxide (CO 2). Furthermore we present an assessment of emissions and removals associated with the sector Land Use, Change of Land Use and Forestry (UTMUTF), for São Paulo state, considering the periods from 1994 to 2002, 2002 to 2005 and from 2005 to 2008. 76 TM / ETM+ images for the base years (1994, 2002, 2005 and 2008) were used, generating about 245. 000 polygons, that integrated all different classes of mapping data, through the union and intersection of distinct information layers. It was found that Sao Paulo state, on average, proved to be a CO 2 remover with respect to the sector UTMUTF. The method was found suitable and efficient for those estimates. Pages: 8645 - 865...|$|R
40|$|The goal to {{stabilize}} global average surface temperature at lower than 2 °C above pre-industrial level {{has been extensively}} discussed in climate negotiations. A number of publications state that achieving this goal will require <b>net</b> <b>anthropogenic</b> carbon <b>emissions</b> (defined as <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> minus <b>anthropogenic</b> sinks such as carbon capture and sequestration and reforestation) to be reduced to zero between years 2050 and 2100. At the same time, it is also shown in the literature that decreases of non-CO 2 emissions can significantly affect the allowable carbon budget. In this study, we explore possible emission pathways under which surface warming will not exceed 2 °C, by means of emission-driven climate simulations with an Earth System Model of Intermediate Complexity linked to an Economic Projection and Policy Analysis Model. We carried {{out a number of}} simulations from 1861 to 2500 for different values of parameters defining the strength of the climate system response to radiative forcing and the strength of the natural carbon sources and sinks under different <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emission</b> projections. Although <b>net</b> <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> need to be reduced to zero eventually to achieve climate stabilization, the results of our simulations suggest that, by including significant reductions in non-CO 2 emissions, net carbon emissions {{do not have to be}} zero by 2050 or even 2100 to meet the 2 °C target because of offsets due to the natural carbon sinks in the oceans and terrestrial ecosystems. We show that <b>net</b> <b>anthropogenic</b> carbon <b>emissions</b> falling from today’s 9. 5 GtC/year to 2. 5 – 7 GtC/year by 2050 and then to 1 – 2. 8 GtC/year by 2100 are consistent with a 2 °C target for a range of climate sensitivities (2. 0 – 4. 5 °C) similar to the IPCC likely range. Changes in the surface temperature beyond 2100 depend on the emission profiles after 2100. For post- 2100 carbon emissions decreasing at a rate of about 1. 5 % per year along with continued decreases in non-CO 2 emissions, our projections indicate that natural ecosystems will be able to absorb enough carbon to prevent surface temperature from rising further. A major reason for our results is that the land and ocean uptake rates are a function of the total atmospheric CO 2 concentration and, due to the very long lifetime of CO 2, this does not decrease anywhere near as fast as the imposed CO 2 emissions. The required mixes of energy technologies and the overall costs to achieve the 2 °C target are highly dependent on the assumptions about the future costs of low-carbon and zero-carbon emitting technologies.

This study demonstrates the feasibility of using the decoupled direct method (DDM) to calculate first- and second-order sensitivity of ozone to anthropogenic NO x and VOC emissions in annual PGM simulations at continental scale.

The AFOLU sector (Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use) contributes roughly a quarter (∼ 10 – 12 Pg CO 2 e yr− 1) of the <b>net</b> <b>anthropogenic</b> GHG <b>emissions</b> mainly from de- forestation, fire, wood harvesting, and agricultural emissions including croplands, paddy rice, and livestock. In spite {{of the importance of}} this sector, it is unclear where the regions with hotspots of AFOLU emissions are and how uncertain these emissions are. Here we present a novel, spatially com- parable dataset containing annual mean estimates of gross AFOLU emissions (CO 2, CH 4, N 2 O), associated uncertain- ties, and leading emission sources, in a spatially disaggre-gated manner (0. 5 ◦) for the tropics for the period 2000 – 2005. Our data highlight the following: (i) the existence of AFOLU emissions hotspots on all continents, with particular impor- tance of evergreen rainforest deforestation in Central and South America, fire in dry forests in Africa, and both peat- land emissions and agriculture in Asia; (ii) a predominant contribution of forests and CO 2 to the total AFOLU emis- sions (69 %) and to their uncertainties (98 %); (iii) higher gross fluxes from forests, which coincide with higher uncer- tainties, making agricultural hotspots appealing for effective mitigation action; and (iv) a lower contribution of non-CO 2 agricultural emissions to the total gross emissions (ca. 25 %), with livestock (15. 5 %) and rice (7 %) leading the emissions. Gross AFOLU tropical emissions of 8. 0 (5. 5 – 12. 2) were in the range of other databases (8. 4 and 8. 0 Pg CO 2 e yr− 1 in FAOSTAT and the Emissions Database for Global Atmo- spheric Research (EDGAR) respectively), but we offer a spa- tially detailed benchmark for monitoring progress in reduc- ing emissions from the land sector in the tropics.

In this work, we apply different <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emission</b> inventories in the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) version 3. 3 using Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers (MOZART) gas-phase chemistry and Global Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) aerosols to examine the differences in predicted carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O 3) surface mixing ratios for Southeast Asia in March and December 2008. The <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emission</b> inventories include the Reanalysis of the TROpospheric chemical composition (RETRO), the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment-Phase B (INTEX-B), the MACCity emissions (adapted from the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate and megacity Zoom for the Environment projects), the Southeast Asia Composition, Cloud, Climate Coupling Regional Study (SEAC 4 RS) emissions, and a combination of MACCity and SEAC 4 RS emissions. Biomass-burning emissions are from the Fire Inventory from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) (FINNv 1) model. WRF-Chem reasonably predicts the 2 m temperature, 10 m wind, and precipitation. In general, surface CO is underpredicted by WRF-Chem while surface O 3 is overpredicted. The NO 2 tropospheric column predicted by WRF-Chem has the same magnitude as observations, but tends to underpredict the NO 2 column over the equatorial ocean and near Indonesia. Simulations using different <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> produce only a slight variability of O 3 and CO mixing ratios, while biomass-burning emissions add more variability. The different <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> differ by up to 30 % in CO emissions, but O 3 and CO mixing ratios averaged over the land areas of the model domain differ by ~ 4. 5 % and ~ 8 %, respectively, among the simulations.

Impacts of regional <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> on the domain-mean surface pollutant levels (up to 17 % for summertime O 3 and 52 % for wintertime fine particulate matter, PM 2. 5 ) are much higher than those from Istanbul and Athens together (~ 1 % for O 3 and ~ 6 % for PM 2. 5 , respectively). Regional biogenic emissions are found to limit the production of secondary inorganic aerosol species in summer up to 13 % (non-sea-salt sulfate (nss-SO 4 2 &minus;) in rural Athens) due to their impact on oxidant levels while they have negligible impact in winter. Finally, the responses to country-based <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emission</b> mitigation scenarios inside the studied region show increases in O 3 mixing ratios in the urban areas of GIA and GAA, higher in winter (~ 13 % for GIA and 2 % for GAA) than in summer (~ 7 % for GIA and 2. 5 concentrations decrease by up to 30 % in GIA and by 20 % in GAA with the highest improvements computed for winter. The emission reduction strategy also leads to domain-wide decreases in most primary pollutants like carbon monoxide (CO) or nitrogen oxides (NOx) for both seasons.

We performed coupled photochemistry and aerosol microphysics simulations for the period 1980 - 2005 using the aerosol-chemistry-climate model ECHAM 5 -HAMMOZ, to assess our understanding of long-term changes and interannual variability of the chemical composition of the troposphere, and in particular of ozone and sulfate concentrations, for which long-term surface observations are available. In order to separate {{the impact of the}} <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> and natural variability on atmospheric chemistry, we compare two model experiments, driven by the same ECMWF re-analysis data, but with varying and constant <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions,</b> respectively. Our model analysis indicates an increase of ca. 1 ppbv (0. 055 +/- 0. 002 ppbv yr(- 1)) in global average surface O- 3 concentrations due to <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions,</b> but this trend is largely masked by the larger O- 3 anomalies due to the variability of meteorology and natural emissions. The changes in meteorology (not including stratospheric variations) and natural emissions account for the 75 % of the total variability of global average surface O- 3 concentrations. Regionally, annual mean surface O- 3 concentrations increased by 1. 3 and 1. 6 ppbv over Europe and North America, respectively, despite the large <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emission</b> reductions between 1980 and 2005. A comparison of winter and summer O- 3 trends with measurements shows a qualitative agreement, except in North America, where our model erroneously computed a positive trend. Simulated O- 3 increases of more than 4 ppbv in East Asia and 5 ppbv in South Asia can not be corroborated with long-term observations. Global average sulfate surface concentrations are largely controlled by <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions.</b> Globally natural emissions are an important driver determining AOD variations. Regionally, AOD decreased by 28 % over Europe, while it increased by 19 % and 26 % in East and South Asia. The global radiative perturbation calculated in our model for the period 1980 - 2005 was rather small (0. 05 W m(- 2) for O- 3 and 0. 02 W m(- 2) for total aerosol direct effect), but larger perturbations ranging from - 0. 54 to 1. 26 W m(- 2) are estimated in those regions where <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> largely varied...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{contribution}} of North American (NA) lightning and <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> to ozone concentrations, radiative forcing, and export fluxes from North America during summers 2002 and 2004 using the University of Maryland Chemical Transport Model (UMD-CTM) driven by GEOS- 4 reanalysis. Reduced power plant emissions (NOx SIP Call) and cooler temperatures in 2004 compared to 2002 resulted in lower ambient ozone concentrations over the eastern United States. Lightning flash rates in early summer 2004 were 50 % higher than 2002 over the United States. Over the North Atlantic, changes in ozone column between early summer 2002 and 2004 due to changes in lightning and meteorology exceeded the change due to emission reductions {{by a factor of}} 7. Late summer changes in lightning had a much smaller impact on ozone columns. In summer 2004, net downward radiative flux at the tropopause due to ozone produced from <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> ranged from 0. 15 to 0. 30 W m− 2 across the North Atlantic, while that due to ozone produced from lightning NO emissions ranged from 0. 20 to 0. 50 W m− 2. Enhanced lofting of polluted air followed by stronger westerly winds led to more net export of NOx, NOy, and ozone in early summer 2004 than 2002 despite reduced <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions.</b> Ozone export fluxes across the eastern NA boundary due to <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> were factors of 1. 6 and 2 larger than those due to lightning in 2004 and 2002, respectively. Doubling the NA lightning NO source increased downwind ozone enhancements due to lightning NO emissions by one third...|$|R
