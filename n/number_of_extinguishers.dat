40|$|The {{turnings}} {{have proved}} to be highly inflammable and subject to spontaneous ignition. Several experiments have been conducted at Herring-Hall-Marvin Safe Company, Hamilton, Ohio, and Baker Brothers, Inc., Toledo, Ohio, and in addition {{there have been a number}} of accidental fires, of which at least three were spontaneous. Fires of quantities ranging from several pounds to several hundred pounds have been experienced and a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinguishers</b> have been tried.

40|$|In {{industrial}} conditions, {{there are}} different kinds of installations endangered by an explosion of dust-gas mixtures [1, 2]. In order {{to prevent them from}} severe consequences of potential explosions, active protection systems, which use various kinds of suppressing materials, like suppressing powders and water, are increasingly widely applied [3, 4, 5, 6]. Results of the experiments are presented in the work. The main objective of the research was to investigate influence of various parameters like triggering overpressure, type of gas generator, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinguishers</b> etc. on efficiency of suppression system. Efficiency of dust explosion suppression of two various types of the extinguishers, using water or suppressing powder, was compared. The main conclusion of this research is that water can be a very effective suppressing medium in suppression of dust-air mixtures explosion. Activating overpressure has very strong influence on the explosion suppression efficiency and the best suppression efficiency was obtained in experiments in which the suppression system was triggered by a signal from photodiode...|$|E

50|$|In 1975 Chubb Fire {{launched}} their new range <b>of</b> <b>extinguishers</b> {{under the banner}} 'Seize and Squeeze'! These extinguishers, fitted with a new style of head, enabled them to be operated by simply withdrawing a pin and squeezing a lever-no matter which type <b>of</b> <b>extinguisher</b> in the Chubb range was being used. Previously, different operating methods were needed for different fire fighting media and the new concept ensured that training, especially where multi-purpose risks were involved, became extremely simplified, reducing the possible confusion at a critical time when immediate action is necessary to control a fire outbreak. Operating instructions were made clearer for instant response and colour codes ensured immediate identification of the right type <b>of</b> <b>extinguisher</b> for the appropriate risk. This range <b>of</b> <b>extinguishers</b> was launched at 'Interfire' exhibition in Olympia in July 1975 and in 1976 won the Design Council Award.|$|R
