25|$|There {{are three}} classes of {{components}} for oxide glasses: network formers, intermediates, and modifiers. The network formers (silicon, boron, germanium) form a highly cross-linked network of chemical bonds. The intermediates (titanium, aluminium, zirconium, beryllium, magnesium, zinc) {{can act as}} both network formers and modifiers, according to the glass composition. The modifiers (calcium, lead, lithium, sodium, potassium) alter the network structure; they are usually present as ions, compensated by nearby non-bridging oxygen atoms, bound by one covalent bond to the glass network and holding one negative charge {{to compensate for the}} positive ion nearby. Some elements can play multiple roles; e.g. lead can act both as a <b>network</b> <b>former</b> (Pb4+ replacing Si4+), or as a modifier.|$|E
2500|$|Back when The Simpsons was {{developed}} as a half hour show, co-creator James L. Brooks negotiated an unusual provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content. He {{was able to do}} that, because Fox back then was a minor fledgling <b>network.</b> <b>Former</b> showrunner Bill Oakley considered working on the show to be similar to working in a bubble {{due to the lack of}} interference from the Fox network's executives, as is commonplace on other shows. This allowed them to produce any episodes they wanted, as showrunner Josh Weinstein commented: [...] "The great thing about The Simpsons is that we pretty much were able to get away with everything, so there weren't any episodes we really wanted to do that we couldn't do. Even the crazy high-concept ones like 'Two Bad Neighbors' and 'Homer's Enemy' we managed to put on the air because honestly there were no network execs there to stop us." ...|$|E
