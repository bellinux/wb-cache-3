40|$|A {{straight}} or <b>non-negotiable</b> <b>bill</b> of lading {{is a bill}} of lading {{which is}} made out to a named consignee only. Under English law this bill – although physically transferable from the shipper to the named consignee – cannot be endorsed by the latter to a third party on-buyer. On the other hand the position under American law is different and allows the transferability of the <b>non-negotiable</b> <b>bill</b> by delivery and agreement to transfer title to the bill or to the goods represented by it (49 USC 80106). This article investigates the English and the American approach {{on the issue of}} transferability and negotiability of straight bills of lading and places this significant difference between two major Common Law jurisdictions in its proper context, i. e. the sale of commodities. Three questions are addressed: (a) can a straight bill of lading be tendered by the seller to its buyer for payment? (b) Can a straight bill be tendered under the newly adopted Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 600) ? And (c) does the buyer need to present the straight bill to the carrier in order to obtain redelivery of the cargo carried under it...|$|E
50|$|Waybills are <b>non-negotiable</b> {{documents}} unlike <b>bills</b> of lading {{which are}} negotiable. The words non-negotiable are printed clearly {{at the top}} of the air waybill. This means that the air waybill is a contract for transportation only and does not represent (the value of) merchandise mentioned in the box nature and quantity of goods. The ocean bill of lading, if negotiated, may represent (the value of) the goods and must be endorsed by the party ultimately accepting the goods.Although the AWB is a non-negotiable document, it can be used as a means of payment. This can be done only through the intermediary of a bank and only when the carriage is subject to a letter of credit. The air waybill executed according to the terms of a letter of credit allows the shipper to present the original of the air waybill to the bank and collect the billed value of the shipped goods from the bank. The amount paid by the bank to the shipper will be debited to the consignee who ordered the goods. At the destination the carrier will only hand over the goods to the consignee on receipt of a bank release order from the consignee's bankers.|$|R
