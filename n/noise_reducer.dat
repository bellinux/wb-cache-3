30|$|All HDTV sets in {{use today}} receive {{broadcasting}} bit streams, such as MPEG- 2 or MPEG- 4, and decode them. After decoding, the sets have different functions to produce better image quality for LCDs. The functions, such as enhancers and <b>noise</b> <b>reducers</b> and so on, {{vary depending on the}} manufacturer and set in question. It is impossible to access the video signal inside an HDTV set and show it on another display. If we want to compare individual HDTV sets, we have to compare them with only their displays and with their functions. Although consumers want to buy HDTV sets with better image quality, the methods including the paired comparisons that {{have been reported in the}} literature are not useful to compare more than two displays at the same time. For this comparison, HDTV sets should be assessed with all of their functions and on their own displays.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The <b>noise</b> of main <b>reducer</b> is {{the radiant}} energy of its {{structure}} vibration in the air. There are abundant running messages in its noise {{and this can}} be used as an important index to evaluate its assembly quality. The <b>noise</b> of main <b>reducer</b> is detected on-line and the gained noise signal is dealt with and analyzed. Dimensionless parameters in time/frequency domain and wave packet frequency band energy are extracted from vibration signals as the evaluation indexes of the fault diagnosis to the implementing of on-line diagnosis based on the pattern recognition. The availability of this method is demonstrated by the experiments...|$|R
40|$|The Formation Design of <b>Noise</b> <b>Reducers</b> from Plywood, Foam, Tray, dan Coconut Fiber for Static Sources. Research was {{conducted}} in a semi-anechoic room using a method referring to the ISO 3745. The design used is the Hemisphere in which the source of noise is analogous to engines in an industry. The value reduction {{in the rate of}} sound power is obtained by comparing the sound power level before and after control is given. The noise control test materials used consist of layers of plywood, foam, fiber and tray (egg box). The effectiveness of these materials is tested by measuring the sound transmission loss (STL). Test results reveal that the sound power level (Lw) of the source of noise produces a high Lw which is 99. 6 dB. at a frequency of 8000 Hz. The measurement of Lw on the source of noise which is covered by plywood produces a total of 78. 66 dB Lw with an Lw reduction of 21. 02 %. The measurement on the sound source covered by plywood and foam materials produces a total of 47. 79 dB Lw with an Lw reduction of 52. 02 %. The measurement of Lw by combining plywood, foam, and tray produces a total of 33. 02 dB Lw with an Lw reduction of 66. 84 %. The measurement of the total Lw after being covered by plywood, foam, fiber, and tray is a total of 31. 94 Lw dB with an Lw reduction of 67. 93 %...|$|R

5000|$|The Robert Bosch GmbH, Fernseh Div., {{which later}} became BTS inc. - Philips Digital Video Systems, Thomson's Grass Valley {{and now is}} DFT Digital Film Technology {{introduced}} the world's first CCD telecine in 1979, the FDL-60. The FDL-60 was designed and made in Darmstadt West Germany, {{this was the first}} all solid state Telecine. [...] FDL is short for Film Digital Line. The FDL-60 uses a three CCD single-line array system, whereby three lines, Red Green Blue (RGB) each with 1,024 pixels per line to record a single line of the film image. FDL60A uses three Fairchild Semiconductor CCD 133 CCDs for the image pickup. FDL60A released in 1979 used a 115 Volt lamp to light the film. The FDL60B released in 1982 added improve video quality features to the FDL60. The FDL60C released in 1987 used a Fairchild CCD 134 and a 24 volt light source. In 1983 an optional Grain Reduce was introduced by Bosch for the FDL-60, model FDGR 60. This was the first all digital <b>noise</b> <b>reducer.</b> The FDL 60 could operate stand alone or with a color grade system. Bosch made a scene by scene color corrector, model FRP 60, as an option for the FDL-60. About 568 FDL-60 telecines were manufacture from 1979 to 1989. FDL 60 were ordered in PAL or NTSC or Secam, a few were multi standard by changing a few electronic circuit cards.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of the formulation is to allow to evaluate easily {{the costs of the}} urban distribution of goods by means of wheeled vehicles, and to formalize a methodological outline for the mentioned evaluation, which allows its updating and amplification when it was necessary. The sensitivity of the model illustrates the behaviour of the social costs in front of variations of the parameters which intervene in the model. The social costs which are analyzed in this article are the costs of the polluting emissions of the commercial vehicles, the costs of the noise emitted by the same ones, the costs which generate these vehicles in congestion and the costs of the accidents associated to their circulation. The costs of polluting emissions are considered with a matrix model based on an updating of the deliverable 22 of the project MEET. The costs of the noise are associated to the cost of using asphalt <b>noise</b> <b>reducer</b> in the streets with a high daily average intensity.

40|$|The Semiconductor optical {{amplifier}} (SOA) technology has a promising commercial value and viability in fiber optic communication systems. The SOA is usually {{employed as a}} booster or pre-amplifier in various optical communication networks. On the other hand, SOAs is also a strong option when operation as multi-functional elements in future all-optical networks is concerned. However with this in mind, {{the purpose of this}} project is to design a system employing SOAs as functional devices, for instance the <b>noise</b> <b>reducer</b> utilizing spectrum slicing source. The SOA is therefore modeled and simulated using the OptiSystem software. The SOA gain characteristic is also used to assist the design of the modeled SOA in order to prove a saturation gain case to reduce the Intensity noise. The performances of the systems are thus analyzed in terms of the Q-factor and bit-error-rate (BER) of the eye diagram, Relative intensity noise (RIN) and the optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). The study of the SOA gain characteristics is in large agreement with the numerical simulation results by about 2. 47 % and therefore proves the means of the modeled SOA network used in this particular work. The SOA presents a promising option when operating as a functional device in all optical communication network...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the sources}} of noise in urban areas is {{motorized}} vehicles. An attempt to deal with noise is to control it in its tract by setting up barriers in a form of fence, especially that in Balinese traditional architecture. The research aims to study the effectiveness of different kinds of fence and to study the effects of these fences and the number of vehicles on the noise level produced. The research was conducted based on the (ISO) R 1996 standard, namely the equivalence of noise level of n number of sample. It adopted a purposive sampling select the type of barrier, and focused on the following research objects: (1) type of fence, (2) distance of measurement from a noise source, and (3) type number of vehicles. The effectiveness of a barrier is expressed in the amount of noise reduction from a noise, either with or without barrier, and the coefficient of muting from each barrier. The tests to analyze the data are the correlation test to know the effectiveness of barrier and the regression test to know the kind of relationship between the type of vehicle and the noise level. The research found that a massive fence is the most effective <b>noise</b> <b>reducer</b> among different tyes of fence, with coefficient of 0. 12. However, it offers less aesthetic element as it gives a impression of individualsm in addition to its structure that obstructs the eyes to see what is happening ourtside. A fence with gaps covered with vegetation is better both from the esthetic point of view and from physical function that is to reduce noise, with a coefficient of 0. 09. The relation between the noise level and the number of vehicle can be identified by using a linear equation approach by putting the equivalence of the number of vehicle with that of motorcycle. Salah satu sumber kebisingan di daerah urban adalah kendaraan bermotor. Upaya untuk menghadapi kebisingan ini adalah mengendalikannya dengan cara memasang penghalang (barrier) dalam bentuk pagar, seperti misalnya pada arsitektur tradisional Bali. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk melakukan studi tentang efektivitas berbagai macam pagar dan tentang efek pagar ini dan jumlah kendaraan bermotor terhadap tingkat kebisingan yang ditimbulkan. Penelitian ini dilaksanakan berdasar pada standar (ISO) R 1996, atau Equivalence of Noise Level of n number of sample. Penelitian ini mengadopsi sampling purposif untuk memilih jenis penghalang, dan berfokus pada objek berikut: (1) jenis pagar, (2) jarak dari sumber kebisingan, dan (3) jumlah jenis kendaraan. Efektivitas penghalang diekspresikan dalam jumlah reduksi kebisingan dari suatu kebisingan, baik menggunakan atau tidak menggunakan penghalang, serta koefisien keheningan (coefficient of muting) dari setiap penghalang. Tes untuk menganalisis data meliputi korelasi untuk mengetahui efektifitas penghalang, dan tes regresi untuk mengetahui hubungan antara jenis kendaraan dan tingkat kebisingan. Penelitian ini menemukan bahwa pagar masif merupakan pengurang kebisingan yang paling efektif diantara jenis-jenis pagar yang ada, dengan koefisien 0, 12, tetapi jenis ini memiliki kekurangan elemen estetika dan memberikan kesan individualistik ditambah lagi bahwa struktur tersebut menghalangi pandangan apa yang terjadi diluar. Pagar yang berselang-seling dan ditutupi dengan vegetasi lebih baik ditinjau dari sisi estetika maupun fungsi fisik untuk mengurangi kebisingan, dengan koefisien 0, 09. Relasi antara tingkat kebisingan dan jumlah kendaraan dapat diidentifikasi dengan menggunakan persamaan linier dengan memberikan jumlah kendaraan yang equivalen dengan jumlah sepeda motor...|$|E
