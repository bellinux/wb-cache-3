5|$|By mid-1841, {{the federal}} {{government}} faced a projected budget deficit of $11 million. Tyler recognized the need for higher tariffs, but wished {{to stay within the}} 20 percent rate created by the 1833 Compromise Tariff. He also supported a plan to distribute to the states any revenue from the sales of public land, as an emergency measure to manage the states' growing debt, even though this would cut federal revenue. The Whigs supported high protectionist tariffs and <b>national</b> <b>funding</b> of state infrastructure, and so there was enough overlap to forge a compromise. The Distribution Act of 1841 created a distribution program, with a ceiling on tariffs at 20 percent; a second bill increased tariffs to that figure on previously low-tax goods. Despite these measures, by March 1842 it had become clear that {{the federal government}} was still in dire fiscal straits.|$|E

25|$|A 2005 {{report found}} serious {{shortcomings}} to China’s national innovation system. There were problems with services to help turn S work into {{results and the}} allocation of <b>national</b> <b>funding</b> to support S was far from optimal. Sometimes researchers became short-sighted if they {{get too close to}} the market. Another serious problem was that companies facing severe competition looked first to purchase foreign technology rather than investing in developing technology and technology development capacity at home in China. Many of the patent applications came from medium-sized enterprises (70%) since small enterprises invest little in research. China's hierarchical, top-down society where authority is greatly respected and feared has been argued to stifle creative debate.|$|E

25|$|The council subsidy was halved in 2011 {{at the end}} of {{the three-year}} deal, with the council stating that with the large {{increase}} in passenger numbers, such a large subsidy was no longer necessary. Local groups, including FOSBR and the Green Party claimed that services became less reliable following the cut, but First Great Western and the council stated that reliability problems were not due to the cut in subsidy, but instead due to breakdowns and track maintenance. The council subsidies, for both increased services and Sunday services, are due to be replaced by <b>national</b> <b>funding</b> in 2015. An additional evening service was agreed in February 2012, to start in September 2012, after protests about a 100-minute gap in the timetable.

25|$|Proposals for {{a railway}} to Brevik were first put forward in 1875, {{but not until}} 4 July 1891 did Parliament pass {{legislation}} to build the line. With <b>national</b> <b>funding</b> secured, the political debate moved {{to the location of}} the station in Brevik. Locations at Setretangen and Strømtangen were proposed. Setretangen would give a station closer to the village center, while Strømtangen would give access to docks which had less ice during winter. A public meeting was called in January 1892 by the proponents of the former to secure public support. As the public seemed to support Strømtangen, the organizers never let the issue come to a vote. The issue was then discussed in the municipal council's executive board, where four against one members supported the Strømtangen alternative. The location was finally decided by the municipal council on 25 June 1892, when sixteen against four aldermen voted in favor of Strømtangen, and subsequently approved by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB).|$|E

500|$|Because of the 1983 rejection, {{an earlier}} idea {{that had been}} tried and failed in 1979 was revisited: Creating {{regional}} Federations for the Americas, Europe, Oceania and Asia, regional groupings mirroring that of the Olympic organisers. [...] This was implemented by 1987, which was rejected later that year because the sport did not meet all the criteria established {{and it was not}} yet a global sport. [...] The IOC viewed the sport as one belonging only to the Commonwealth of Nations. While the netball was rejected for a third time, the New Zealand hosts of the 1990 Commonwealth Games managed to get the sport to have demonstration status, with the news of this being announced in 1987. [...] That same year, netball also gained full member status from the General Assembly of International Sports Federations In the mean time, the IOC did provide the Federation with a [...] grant, though none of this grant money was used by 1991.
