5|$|Chauvel {{appended}} 32 {{names of}} soldiers he recommended for awards {{that had been}} ignored. Two New Zealanders recommended for a Bar to their Distinguished Service Orders (DSO) were <b>not</b> <b>even</b> mentioned in despatches and an outstanding Australian regimental commander recommended for the CMG was also <b>not</b> <b>even</b> mentioned in despatches, while a brigade commander and a staff officer Chauvel recommended for DSOs received mentions.|$|E
5|$|A catchy jingle and ad campaign, it {{has come}} to embody a piece of Americana, and has even seeped into the {{consciousness}} of people who were too young (or <b>not</b> <b>even</b> alive) to remember the campaign when it occurred. The slogan was so well-remembered that it was added to Simpson's Contemporary Quotations in 1988.|$|E
5|$|A related {{objection}} is {{that evolution}} {{is based on}} unreliable evidence, claiming that evolution is <b>not</b> <b>even</b> well-evidenced. Typically, this is either based on the argument that evolution's evidence is full of frauds and hoaxes, that current evidence for evolution {{is likely to be}} overturned as some past evidence has been, or that certain types of evidence are inconsistent and dubious.|$|E

5|$|By 1939, Low Fell {{had become}} the select suburb of Gateshead and had {{substantial}} and independent shopping facilities. All of the houses between Shipcote and the village were private and the owners added 'Low Fell' to their addresses, at times <b>not</b> <b>even</b> mentioning Gateshead, although, if we adhere to the original boundaries, they did not live in Low Fell at all".|$|E
5|$|Chinatown {{was finally}} {{released}} in October 1980, and reached no. 7 in the UK, but {{by this time}} Thin Lizzy albums were <b>not</b> <b>even</b> reaching the top 100 in the US.

5|$|Donal {{meanwhile}} {{turns to}} alcohol, devastated {{at the fact}} that he has brought about a god who, according to Donal's religion, should <b>not</b> <b>even</b> exist. However, Reed's analysis leads him to believe that the final component needed to deal with the rift is lightning, and Donal is convinced to turn into the Viking god once more.|$|E

50|$|Another {{example of}} a {{molecule}} which is <b>not</b> antiaromatic <b>even</b> though it might initially appear to be so is cyclooctatetraene. Cyclooctatetraene assumes a tub (i.e., boat-like) conformation. As it is <b>not</b> planar, <b>even</b> though it has 4n π-electrons, these electrons are not delocalized and conjugated. The molecule is therefore nonaromatic.|$|R
5|$|During the Gulf War of 1991, the {{air superiority}} of the {{coalition}} forces {{was so great that}} the majority of Iraqi Su-25s did <b>not</b> <b>even</b> manage to get airborne. On 25 January 1991, seven Iraqi Air Force Su-25s fled from Iraq and landed in Iran.|$|E
5|$|France {{eventually}} {{also failed}} to obtain orders from the remaining two FINABEL nations, Belgium and the Netherlands: the Dutch did <b>not</b> <b>even</b> test the type and the Belgians ordered the Leopard when France refused to allow partial component production of the AMX-30 in Belgium, fearing it would increase the unit cost.|$|E
5|$|If Cuthbert was at Hereford, {{he served}} in that {{capacity}} for four years before his elevation to the See of Canterbury in 740. He is credited with the composition of an epitaph for the tomb of his three predecessors at Hereford.

5|$|Loring {{was also}} home to an administrations support base of a Green Pine {{communications}} crew from Naval Station Argentia.

5|$|Middlesbrough manager Steve McClaren had <b>not</b> <b>even</b> {{sat down}} when his team took the lead. Mendieta's pass let Zenden {{run down the}} left wing and cross for striker Joseph-Désiré Job to put Middlesbrough ahead in the second minute. It was the fastest goal scored in a final, a record broken the {{following}} year by Liverpool's John Arne Riise.|$|E

5|$|The Morris Academy is {{entitled}} {{to be called a}} pioneer institution because of its 'open door' policy in coeducation.

No other coeducational academy spread its influence so far.|$|E
