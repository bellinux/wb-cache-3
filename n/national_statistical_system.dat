40|$|The {{preparation}} of over 564 Human Development Reports (HDRs) {{at various levels}} and, more recently, over 100 Millennium Development Goal Reports (MDGRs) have placed enormous demands on the <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>systems</b> across countries. While the evolving of newer indices designed to capture more qualitative dimensions of living pose one set of challenges, the need to compile data on much more specific indicators that are monitored {{over a long period}} of time in the MDGRs poses another set of challenges. Moreover, the spread of Right to Information and similar movements across countries has meant that, increasingly, questions are being raised about the ways in which information is collected and disseminated. The main objectives of the paper are to examine: the emerging statistical requirements for reporting on National HDRs and MDGRs, to examine their implications for generation and dissemination of data by <b>National</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Systems,</b> and to suggest alternatives to ensure that the 'process' that enables the <b>National</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Systems</b> to collate and disseminate data are in keeping with the principles of participation and transparency.

The views {{expressed in this}} document, which has been reproduced without formal editing, {{are those of the}} authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Organization. Summary This document synthesizes and updates the results of a research programme conducted at the request of the Statistical Conference of the Americas (SCA). It builds upon a first report, available in Spanish, which was prepared by José L. Cervera-Ferri, consultant at the Statistics and Economic Projections Division of the ECLAC. It was based, inter alia, on the answers to an ECLAC questionnaire circulated to the <b>National</b> <b>Statistical</b> Offices (NSOs) of the region in 2005 regarding the "institutional aspects of monitoring the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the response of the <b>National</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Systems</b> (NSS) in producing the necessary indicators. The objective was to analyze the way information gathered by the diverse entities that form the NSS in the region is systematized at national level, and identify the role NSOs should take as rector and coordinator of the NSS. This questionnaire was the first step in a 2005 - 2007 programme of research and technical assistance conducted by the Statistics and Economic Projections Division of the ECLAC, with a view of strengthening technical and institutional capacities in the region. Intermediary results were presented and discussed at the Third Statistical Conference of the Americas, in June 2005. In November 2006, a regional seminar was organized by ECLAC to update the evaluation of the NSOs' situation with regard to the MDGs. This meeting was the opportunity to review the changes that occur since 2005, and analyse the best regional practices. The present document identifies six main challenges facing the <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>systems</b> in following-up the MDGs, ranging from expanding the availability of data to securing the proper institutional and financial context. These challenges are interrelated, and therefore the coordination of the <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>systems</b> should be viewed as a strategic priority. In addition to strengthening the systemic coherence of the various <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> actors, the report identifies a series of technical issues that require specific attention in view of coordinating the monitoring of the MDGs. Monitoring the MDGs provides also opportunities for strengthening <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>systems.</b> Indeed, the follow-up to the MDGs has helped generating national, regional and international discussions a policy level on the importance of statistical information in the development process. The document revises these opportunities and proposes a strategy that engages all the statistics-generating agencies in each Latin American and Caribbean country. The Statistical Conference of the Americas has taken the lead in this respect, by formally including the monitoring of the MDGs as one of the main dimension of its 2005 - 2015 strategic plan. The document underlines the specific role of the SCA for the development of the statistical capabilities in Latin America and the Caribbean and for bridging the existing gaps between national and international MDG indicators. It is also offers some preliminary and partial answers from Latin America and the Caribbean to the call of the United Nations Statistical Commission' s Friends of the Chair on MDGs indicators asking Regional Commissions to "conduct studies of the ability of countries to provide reliable data on MDG indicators".

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the census is to provide information on the population and its characteristics. This information is a key input used {{as a basis for}} a wide variety of planning decisions in a country and the quality of this information is paramount. It is also serves to underpin the <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>system,</b> with the census being used as a denominator for other statistics, such as the gross domestic product. However, with the fast-changing pace of modern life, in combination with increased mobility of the population to be counted, the traditional census which counted the resident population has had to adapt to account for this and also evaluate the resulting impact on the measurement of quality. Furthermore, as the <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>system</b> of a country develops, it is found that an increasing amount of information is collected about the country through registers and surveys. As such, many countries have been considering innovative ways of using such existing information to augment their censuses and improve their quality.

The Chairperson of the Executive Committee of the Statistical Conference of the Americas presented a document (LC/L. 2215); entitled Reflections on the Meeting of the Statistical Conference of the Americas of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. There ensued a round- table discussion during which  participants adopted the proposal to produce a guideline document to respond  to countries' needs. For that  purpose, they agreed to set up working groups composed of representatives of the countries and of multilateral agencies to work on the following topics: (i); legal and institutional aspects, including questions of financing and budgeting, as well as coordination of <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> systems; (ii); development of statistical capacity with long-run targets in terms of production, quality and dissemination of statistics, using a step-by-step approach to achieve those targets; (iii); training and human resources management policies; (iv); modernization of the management processes of national institutes of statistics, {{in order to make the}} best possible use of resources;  (v); relationships between producers and users of statistics in general; and (vi); strengthening international cooperation.

One of the three pillars of the Global Strategy is the integration of agriculture into the <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>system</b> which is obtained through three methodological tools: (i) an integrated survey framework, that defines the mix and frequency of data collection initiatives needed to meet the predefined data requirements; (ii) an integrated statistical data base, that provides data management system for different data sources (censuses, surveys, administrative data), using common definitions and classifications and ensuring that only one number is agreed as official statistics; (iii) a master sampling frame, that is the basis for selecting the sample of all agriculture-related surveys across the <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>system,</b> thus allowing coordinated data collections. Little guidance is currently available on buiding a Master Sample Frame for agricultural surveys in different country contexts. The FAO and UNFPA Guidelines for Linking Population and Housing Censuses with Agricultura Censuses aim to fill this gap.
