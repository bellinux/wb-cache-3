40|$|SummaryThe {{long-term}} {{balance between}} <b>net</b> <b>precipitation</b> and net groundwater exchange that maintains thousands of seepage lakes in Florida’s karst terrain is explored at a representative lake basin and then regionally for the State’s peninsular lake district. The 15 -year water budget of Lake Starr includes El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) -related extremes in rainfall, {{and provides the}} longest record of Bowen ratio energy-budget (BREB) lake evaporation and lake-groundwater exchanges in the southeastern United States. Negative <b>net</b> <b>precipitation</b> averaging − 25 cm/yr at Lake Starr overturns the previously-held conclusion that lakes in this region receive surplus <b>net</b> <b>precipitation.</b> Net groundwater exchange with the lake was positive on average but too small to balance the <b>net</b> <b>precipitation</b> deficit. Groundwater pumping effects and surface-water withdrawals from the lake widened the imbalance. Satellite-based regional estimates of potential evapotranspiration at five large lakes in peninsular Florida compared well with basin-scale evaporation measurements from seven open-water sites that used BREB methods. The regional average lake evaporation estimated for Lake Starr during 1996 – 2011 was within 5 % of its measured average, and regional <b>net</b> <b>precipitation</b> agreed within 10 %. Regional <b>net</b> <b>precipitation</b> to lakes was negative throughout central peninsular Florida and the <b>net</b> <b>precipitation</b> deficit increased by about 20 cm from north to south. Results indicate that seepage lakes farther south on the peninsula receive greater net groundwater inflow than northern lakes and imply that northern lakes are in comparatively leakier hydrogeologic settings.

40|$|Transport {{of water}} vapor in the {{atmosphere}} generates substantial spatial variability of <b>net</b> <b>precipitation</b> (precipitation minus evaporation). Over half of the total spatial variability in annual-mean <b>net</b> <b>precipitation</b> is accounted for by deviations from the zonal mean. Over land, these regional differences determine differences in surface water availability. Over oceans, they account, for example, for the Pacific–Atlantic difference in sea surface salinity, with implications for the deep overturning circulation. This study analyzes the atmospheric water budget in reanalyses from ERA-Interim and MERRA, to investigate which physical balances lead to zonal variation in <b>net</b> <b>precipitation.</b> It is found that the leading-order contribution is zonal variation in stationary-eddy vertical motion. Transient eddies modify the pattern of zonally anomalous <b>net</b> <b>precipitation</b> by moving moisture from the subtropical and tropical oceans onto land and poleward across the Northern Hemisphere storm tracks. Zonal variation in specific humidity and stationary-eddy horizontal advection play a secondary role. The dy-namics leading to <b>net</b> <b>precipitation</b> via vertical motion in stationary eddies can be understood from a lower-tropospheric vorticity budget. The large-scale variations of vertical motion are primarily described by Sverdrup balance and Ekman pumping, with some modification by transient eddies.

A broad range of mountain dimensions and moist stabilities are considered to encompass a spectrum of physically plausible flows. The simulations reveal that convection only enhances orographic precipitation in cap clouds that are otherwise unable to efficiently convert cloud condensate into precipitate. For tall and wide mountains (e. g. the Washington Cascades or the southern Andes), precipitate forms efficiently through vapour deposition and collection, {{even in the absence}} of embedded convection. When embedded convection develops in such clouds, it produces competing effects (enhanced condensation in updraughts and enhanced evaporation through turbulent mixing and compensating subsidence) that cancel to yield little <b>net</b> change in <b>precipitation.</b> By contrast, convection strongly enhances precipitation over short and narrow mountains (e. g. the UK Pennines or the Oregon Coastal Range) where precipitation formation is otherwise highly inefficient. Although cancellation between increased condensation and evaporation still occurs, the enhanced precipitation formation within the convective updraughts leads to a <b>net</b> increase in <b>precipitation</b> efficiency.

Its small-scale heterogeneity impacts the partitioning of precipitation (e. g., deep percolation or transpiration) by triggering threshold processes and connecting flow paths. Forest hydrologists frequently hypothesized that throughfall and stemflow patterns induce soil water content heterogeneity, yet experimental validation is limited. Here, we pursued a pattern-oriented approach to explore the relationship between <b>net</b> <b>precipitation</b> and soil water content. Both were measured in independent high-resolution stratified random designs on a 1 -ha temperate mixed beech forest plot in Germany. We recorded throughfall (350 locations) and stemflow (65 trees) for 16 precipitation events in 2015. Soil water content was measured continuously in topsoil and subsoil (210 profiles). Soil wetting was only weakly related to <b>net</b> <b>precipitation</b> patterns. The precipitation-induced pattern quickly dissipates and returns to a basic pattern, which is temporally stable. Instead, soil hydraulic properties (by the proxy of field capacity) were significantly correlated with this stable soil water content pattern, indicating that soil structure more than <b>net</b> <b>precipitation</b> drives soil water content heterogeneity. Also, both field capacity and soil water content were lower {{in the immediate vicinity}} of tree stems compared to further away at all times, including winter, despite stemflow occurrence. Thus, soil structure varies systematically according to vegetation in our site. We conclude that enhanced macroporosity increases gravity-driven flow in stem proximal areas.

The investigated period is slightly warmer and wetter than the climatological mean.

For throughfall and stemflow quantification, 25 rain gauges and collectors were installed in trees having circumference higher than 15 cm, in each plot. An additional rain gauge was installed in an open area to quantify gross precipitation. Gross precipitation in the studied period was 1934 mm.

The methodology identifies the contribution of humidity to the moisture budget in a region by computing the changes in specific humidity along backward (or forward) trajectories of air masses over a period of ten days beforehand (afterwards), thereby allowing the calculation of monthly, seasonal and annual averages. The current study calculates as an example the climatological seasonal mean and variance of the <b>net</b> <b>precipitation</b> for regions in which precipitation exceeds evaporation (E-P 0) can be discounted after when the integration of E-P is done without affecting the general <b>net</b> <b>precipitation</b> patterns when it is discounted in a monthly or longer time scale...|$|E
30|$|The Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI; Keetch and Byram 1968) {{was used}} as a proxy for soil {{moisture}} availability at each of the study sites. KBDI is used extensively in fire planning to index the moisture content of the upper soil layer {{as well as that of}} the duff layer, which affect potential fire intensity and difficulty of control. The index represents the <b>net</b> effect of <b>precipitation</b> and evapotranspiration on soil moisture content in the top 20.3 cm (8 in) of soil. For each day without more than 5.1 mm (0.2 in) of rainfall, the index is increased. More substantial increases are made when air temperature is high. The index is reduced for every 0.254 mm (0.01 in) above 5.1 mm (0.2 in) of rainfall received on the previous day. The minimum KBDI value is zero and the maximum value is 800.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{developed}} a technique for studying seasonal and interannual variation in pyrogenic carbon emissions from Africa using a modelling approach that scales burned area es-timates from L 3 JRC, a map recently generated from remote sensing of burn scars instead of active fires. Carbon fluxes were calculated by the novel fire model SPITFIRE embed-ded within the dynamic vegetation model framework LPJ-GUESS, using daily climate input. For {{the time period}} from 2001 to 2005 an average area of 195. 5 ± 24 × 104 km 2 was burned annually, releasing an aver-age of 723 ± 70 Tg C to the atmosphere; these estimates for the biomass burned are {{within the range of}} previously pub-lished estimates. Despite the fact that the majority of wild-fires are ignited by humans, strong relationships between cli-matic conditions (particularly <b>precipitation),</b> <b>net</b> primary pro...|$|R
40|$|RiskView {{is a tool}} {{developed}} by the World Food Programme (WFP) to translate weather data (real-time and historical) and other spatial information (e. g., crops, drought risk, population, etc.) into food security needs and response costs. It serves as a swift way of estimating costs in advance of food insecurity outlooks for financial planning, and for facilitating better resource allocations to disasters before on-the-ground needs assessments are produced. One of the cores of RiskView is the calculation of Water Requirement Satisfaction Index (WRSI) to estimate drought risks at the aggregate scale. WRSI is {{used to determine the}} risk of a region being food insecure in a coming season. To accomplish this, RiskView applies a forward- looking approach in which observed rainfall from the current season is used to calculate WRSI up to the current date, then samples rainfall from historical years to calculate WRSI for the remaining part of the cropping season. This forward-looking approach allows RiskView to include estimates of uncertainty in the calculations of WRSI from historical information. However, this capability could potentially be enhanced by using seasonal climate forecasts to weight historical years instead of assigning them equal weights. For this reason, WFP partnered with IRI to develop weights to be applied to WRSI values calculated for administrative regions in Africa. These would weight projections of end-of-season WRSI values based on the IRI <b>Net</b> Assessment seasonal <b>precipitation</b> forecasts. In RiskView, for a particular agricultural or pastoral season and administrative region, WFP calculates projected end-of-season WRSI values based upon historical RFE precipitation estimates from previous seasons (beginning with 1996) to reflect potential uncertainty in the projected WRSI estimate. The IRI weights based upon the latest IRI <b>Net</b> Assessment seasonal <b>precipitation</b> forecast would be applied to the historical end-of-season WRSI values from previous seasons to provide a forecast-based shift in the PDF to adjust the projected end-of-season WRSI values for the current agricultural or pastoral season of interest. This report outlines the procedure used to develop these weights and how it can be incorporated within Africa RiskView and its outputs...|$|R
