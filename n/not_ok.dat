500|$|Attanasio, Levinson and Fontana {{strove to}} make Homicide more {{realistic}} than other police dramas, even in minor details. For example, Levinson specifically asked that {{a dead body}} found by detectives in [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] be badly decomposing and attracting flies because he felt other shows did not portray corpses in a realistic way. Some episodes, like [...] "Ghost of a Chance", focus on murders {{that take place in}} wealthy rural settings, rather than an urban or predominantly poorer location as most police dramas did. Homicide was noted for demonstrating better than most American television police shows that murders can take place in various socioeconomic circumstances. In striving for realism, some cases in Homicide remain unsolved and murderers go free, most notably in the Adena Watson case. This theme often put the show's producers at odds with NBC executives, who wanted happier endings with more closure. Fontana said of the Watson investigation, [...] "We never solved it because we felt {{that it would be a}} disservice to the real girl, to have this fake TV solution. Because it's <b>not</b> <b>O.K.</b> that she died, that no one took responsibility." ...|$|E
500|$|Thompson {{has also}} criticized a Christian video game {{based on the}} Left Behind series. In , players {{participate}} in [...] "battles raging {{in the streets of}} New York," [...] according to the game's fact sheet. They engage in [...] "physical and spiritual warfare: using the power of prayer to strengthen your troops in combat and wield modern military weaponry throughout the game world." [...] Thompson claims that the makers of the game are sacrificing their values. He said, [...] "Because of the Christian context, somehow it's OK? It's <b>not</b> <b>OK.</b> The context is irrelevant. It's a mass-killing game." [...] Left Behind author Tim LaHaye disagrees, saying [...] "Rather than forbid young people from viewing their favorite pastime, I prefer to give them something that's positive." [...] The dispute over the game has caused Thompson to sever ties with Tyndale House, which publishes both the Left Behind books and Thompson's book, Out of Harm's Way. Thompson has not seen the game, which he says has [...] "personally broken my heart," [...] but claims, [...] "I don't have to meet Abraham Lincoln to know that he was the 16th president of the United States." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2013, The Islamic Society in Denmark {{stated that}} they regretted their visit to Lebanon and Egypt in 2006 to show the caricatures because the {{consequences}} had been much more serious than they expected. In August 2013, Ahmed Akkari expressed his regret {{for his role in}} the Imams' tour of the Middle East, stating [...] "I want to be clear today about the trip: It was totally wrong. At that time, I was so fascinated with this logical force in the Islamic mindset that I could not see the greater picture. I was convinced it was a fight for my faith, Islam." [...] Still a practising Muslim, he said that printing the cartoons was ok and he personally apologised to the cartoonist Westergaard. Westergaard responded by saying [...] "I met a man who has converted from being an Islamist to become a humanist who understands the values of our society. To me, he is really sincere, convincing and strong in his views." [...] A spokesman for the Islamic Society of Denmark said [...] "It is still <b>not</b> <b>OK</b> to publish drawings of Muhammad.

500|$|... "Three Men and Adena" [...] {{marked the}} {{conclusion}} of the Adena Watson murder case, a story arc which began {{at the start of the}} first season. The Watson case was based on the real-life 1988 Baltimore slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace, which is chronicled in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book that served as the basis of the Homicide series. Elements of the interview in [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] were incorporated from real-life police interrogations in that case. The Wallace case was never solved, and Fontana insisted that the Watson case in Homicide remain unsolved as well, despite pressure from NBC for a more satisfying conclusion. Fontana said, [...] "We never solved it because we felt that it would be a disservice to the real girl, to have this fake TV solution. Because it's <b>not</b> <b>O.K.</b> that she died, that no one took responsibility." [...] The scene when Tucker admits for a moment he is not sure in his own mind that he didn't commit the murder was inspired by a similar real-life interaction Fontana found in a police interrogation transcript during his research. Fontana said, [...] "It was so chilling (and) I was like, 'Oh man, how do you get there?'" ...|$|E

500|$|... "200" [...] {{features}} {{jokes and}} references to past South Park episodes, storylines, characters and controversies. The episode revolves heavily around {{efforts to bring}} Muhammad into public view. This is based on two past controversies in 2005 (Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy) and 2007 (Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy), when European newspapers published cartoons of Muhammad, which was responded to with reactions of violent riots, global protests and death threats toward the artists. As a result of those incidents, many publications and television studios have refused to broadcast images of Muhammad whatsoever, which was the inspiration behind Tom Cruise's efforts to harvest Muhammad's apparent immunity to satire and ridicule. Parker and Stone addressed the Muhammad issue in their two-part tenth season episode [...] "Cartoon Wars", during which they attempt to show {{an image of the}} prophet, only to reveal that Comedy Central has forbidden any such image from being broadcast on their network. However, Muhammad had already been featured on-screen in the fifth season episode [...] "Super Best Friends", in which he is among a band of religious figures modeled after the superheroes in the Super Friends cartoons from the 1970s and 1980s. (The Super Best Friends are featured once again in [...] "200".) The episode [...] "Super Best Friends" [...] aired in 2001, before the Jyllands-Posten and Vilks controversies. Stan makes reference to that past use of Muhammad's image in [...] "200" [...] by saying of Muhammad, [...] "I saw him once...a while ago..." [...] This reference was purposely included to reflect the irony that an image that was previously not a problem had suddenly become an issue due to new circumstances. Stone said, [...] "Something that was OK is now <b>not</b> <b>OK,</b> and that's just fucked up." [...] The [...] "Super Best Friends" [...] episode continues to be run uncensored by Comedy Central in repeats, even though new images of Muhammad remained prohibited.|$|E

During a rematch at the inaugural SummerSlam at Madison Square Garden in August, Martin distracted Bravo's opponent Muraco to allow Bravo to get the victory (Muraco's usual manager Superstar Billy Graham was doing commentary for the event alongside Gorilla Monsoon as Ventura was assigned as the guest referee for the main event, thus Graham, who was not at ringside, could only look on in frustration at Bravo and Martin's illegal tactics). In October at the King of the Ring, Bravo lost to Jim Duggan in a flag match. At the Royal Rumble in January 1989, Bravo, accompanied by Martin, teamed with The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers (Jacques and Raymond) but lost a two out of three falls match against Jim Duggan and The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart).
