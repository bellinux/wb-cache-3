40|$|Abstract—The {{accuracy}} of first-order Euler and higher-order time-integration algorithms for grid-based Langevin equations collision models {{in a specific}} relaxation test problem is assessed. We show that statistical <b>noise</b> <b>errors</b> can overshadow time-step errors and argue that statistical <b>noise</b> <b>errors</b> can be conflated with time-step effects. Using a higher-order integration scheme may not achieve any benefit in accuracy for examples of practical interest. We also investigate the collisional relaxation of an initial electron-ion relative drift and the collisional relaxation to a resistive steady-state in which a quasi-steady current is driven by a constant applied electric field, as functions of the time step used to resolve the collision processes using binary and grid-based, testparticle Langevin equations models. We compare results from two grid-based Langevin equations collision algorithms to results from a binary collision algorithm for modeling electron-ion collisions. Some guidance is provided on how large a time step can be used compared to the inverse of the characteristic collision frequency for specific relaxation processes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a detailed {{statistical analysis of}} one year (September 2003 to August 2004) of global Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY) carbon monoxide (CO) total column retrievals from the Iterative Maximum Likelihood Method (IMLM) algorithm, version 6. 3. SCIAMACHY provides the first solar reflectance measurements of CO and is uniquely sensitive down to the boundary layer. SCIAMACHY measurements and chemistry transport model (CTM) results are compared and jointly evaluated. Significant improvements in agreement occur, especially close to biomass burning emission regions, when the new Global Fire Emissions Database version 2 (GFEDv 2) is used with the CTM. Globally, the seasonal variation of the model {{is very similar to}} that of the SCIAMACHY measurements. For certain locations, significant differences were found, which are likely related to modeling errors due to CO emission uncertainties. Statistical analysis shows that differences between single SCIAMACHY CO total column measurements and corresponding model results are primarily explained by random instrument <b>noise</b> <b>errors.</b> This strongly suggests that the random instrument <b>noise</b> <b>errors</b> are a good diagnostic for the precision of the measurements. The analysis also indicates that noise in single SCIAMACHY CO measurements is generally greater than actual variations in total columns. It is thus required to average SCIAMACHY data over larger temporal and spatial scales to obtain valuable information. Analyses of monthly averaged SCIAMACHY measurements over 3 ° × 2 ° geographical regions indicates that they are of sufficient accuracy to reveal valuable information about spatial and temporal variations in CO columns and provide an important tool for model validation. A large spatial and temporal variation in instrument <b>noise</b> <b>errors</b> exists which shows a close correspondence with the spatial distribution of surface albedo and cloud cover. This large spatial variability is important for the use of monthly and annual mean SCIAMACHY CO total column measurements. The smallest instrument <b>noise</b> <b>errors</b> of monthly mean 3 ° × 2 ° SCIAMACHY CO total columns measurements are 0. 01 × 1018 molecules/cm 2 for high surface albedo areas over the Sahara. Errors in SCIAMACHY CO total column retrievals due to errors other than instrument noise, like cloud cover, calibration, retrieval uncertainties and averaging kernels are estimated to be about 0. 05 – 0. 1 × 1018 molecules/cm 2 in total. The bias found between model and observations is around 0. 05 – 0. 1 1018 molecules/cm 2 (or about 5 %) which also includes model errors. This thus provides a best estimate of the currently achievable measurement accuracy for SCIAMACHY CO monthly mean averages...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) {{reflects the}} electrical {{activity in the}} brain {{on the surface of}} scalp. A major challenge in this field is the localization of sources in the brain responsible for eliciting the EEG signal measured at the scalp. In order to estimate the location of these sources, one must correctly model the sources, i. e., dipoles, as well as the volume conductor in which the resulting currents flow. In this study, we investigate the effects of dipole depth and orientation on source localization with varying sets of simulated random noise in 4 realistic head models. Methods Dipole simulations were performed using realistic head models and using the boundary element method (BEM). In all, 92 dipole locations placed in temporal and parietal regions of the head with varying depth and orientation were investigated along with 6 different levels of simulated random <b>noise.</b> Localization <b>errors</b> due to dipole depth, orientation and noise were investigated. Results The results indicate that there are no significant differences in localization error due tangential and radial dipoles. With high levels of simulated Gaussian <b>noise,</b> localization <b>errors</b> are depth-dependant. For low levels of added <b>noise,</b> <b>errors</b> are similar for both deep and superficial sources. Conclusion It was found that if the signal-to-noise ratio is above a certain threshold, localization errors in realistic head models are, on average the same for deep and superficial sources. As the <b>noise</b> increases, localization <b>errors</b> increase, particularly for deep sources. </p...|$|R

This method achieves better performance in reducing computational complexity and selecting satellites. The condition of the baseline length is combined with the ambiguity function method (AFM) to search for integer ambiguity, and it is validated in reducing the span of candidates. The <b>noise</b> <b>error</b> is always the key factor to the success rate. It {{is closely related to}} the satellite geometry model. In contrast to the AFM, the LAMBDA (Least-squares AMBiguity Decorrelation Adjustment) method gets better results in solving the relationship of the geometric model and the <b>noise</b> <b>error.</b> Although the AFM is more flexible, it is lack of analysis on this aspect. In this study, the influence of the satellite geometry model on the success rate is analyzed in detail. The computation error and the <b>noise</b> <b>error</b> are effectively treated.
