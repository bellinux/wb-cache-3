500|$|... "Død Kalm" [...] {{received}} mostly mixed to moderately positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Død Kalm" [...] a B, noting that, [...] "Despite clumsy makeup, isolation {{pays off}} again, and Mulder and Scully get {{to try a}} little tenderness." [...] Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club, despite noting his original dislike for the episode, awarded it a B rating and wrote, [...] "This episode works, almost in spite of itself. There are so many <b>nice</b> <b>little</b> moments here [...] it's a script that pauses from the constant horror the show had been serving up for several episodes in a row to just tell an unsettling, ultimately moving tale of two friends who look into the abyss and somehow don't fall." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{next morning}} gay leaders convened in a {{committee}} {{room in the}} Civic Center. Supervisor Harry Britt, who had replaced Milk, along with the more militant gays of the Harvey Milk Democratic Club, {{made it clear that}} nobody was to apologize for the riots. Britt informed a press conference, [...] "Harvey Milk's people do not have anything to apologize for. Now the society {{is going to have to}} deal with us not as <b>nice</b> <b>little</b> fairies who have hairdressing salons, but as people capable of violence. We're not going to put up with Dan Whites anymore." [...] Reporters were surprised that a public official would condone the violent acts of the previous night, expecting an apology from Britt. Subsequent attempts to find a gay leader who would give an apologetic statement proved unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|Some reviews {{were less}} favorable. David Ansen of Newsweek said, [...] "While one respects the filmmaker's small-is-beautiful philosophy, this story {{may indeed be}} too small for its britches.... Beresford's <b>nice</b> <b>little</b> movie seems so afraid to make a false move that it runs the danger of not moving at all." [...] Linda Beath of The Globe and Mail said Duvall's {{performance}} was [...] "fabulous," [...] but that the film was [...] "very slight" [...] compared to Beresford's Australian pictures. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post panned the film, criticizing its mood and tempo and describing Buckley as its only true asset: [...] "Tender Mercies fails because of an apparent dimness of perception that frequently overcomes dramatists: they don't always know when they've got ahold of {{the wrong end of}} the story they want to tell." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{our time}} was {{published}} {{as part of}} Pound's modernist series by Three Mountains Press, Paris in 1924. The work was well received by critics; Edmund Wilson described the writing as [...] "of the first distinction", and in the 1940s he again wrote of [...] "Big Two-Hearted River", [...] "along with the mottled trout... the boy from the American Middle West fishes up a <b>nice</b> <b>little</b> masterpiece." [...] When the story {{was published in the}} United States, critics asserted Hemingway had reinvigorated the short story by his use of declarative sentences and his crisp style. [...] In 1952, reviewing The Old Man and the Sea—for which Hemingway would win the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize in Literature—The New York Times said of [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] {{that it was one of}} the [...] "best and happiest of his early short stories".|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of its initial release, the film had a mixed reception, with both {{positive}} and negative reviews. Bosley Crowther of the New York Times enjoyed the film, calling it [...] "... a <b>nice</b> <b>little</b> package of morbidity, all wrapped around in gloom." [...] Paul Meehan calls it [...] "a tepid potboiler of malfeasance and murder on the high seas." [...] John Brosnan described The Ghost Ship as [...] "a more conventional mystery-thriller involving a number of deaths on board a ship, but was produced with Lewton's customary attention to atmosphere." [...] The script has come in for significant praise, with Captain Stone being compared to Captain Queeg in The Caine Mutiny, Captain Ahab in Moby-Dick, and Captain Wolf Larsen in The Sea-Wolf. Other critics have pointed out that Stone and Merriam seem to have a father-son relationship, but that the perverseness of the script is that the father-figure becomes so enraged at his [...] "son's" [...] failings that he seeks to murder him.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the episode was not entirely favorable. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club noted a general decline in the show's quality in the fourth season, and after a return to form in its previous episode, [...] "Dealbreakers Talk Show #0001", he found [...] "Secret Santa" [...] disappointing, {{and gave it a}} grade B. [...] "It was cute and nicely plotted", he wrote [...] "but it felt a little rote and familiar." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning was more positively inclined. He appreciated Julianne Moore's appearance, but he found that some of the story lines, [...] "though sprinkled with funny moments, were more successful as sweet tales made for the holiday." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was glad to see Cheyenne Jackson's Danny back on 30 Rock, and noted that the plots concerning Jack and Nancy and Kenneth and the TGS writers, respectively, were [...] "home runs". He liked that Tina Fey's character Liz [...] "was more of a supporting player" [...] in [...] "Secret Santa". Sassone also enjoyed Moore's appearance on the show, commenting that she was [...] "wicked good" [...] as Jack's new love interest. Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons wrote that this episode [...] "had some awesome Liz/Jack moments, a <b>nice</b> <b>little</b> storyline for Pete and Danny, and the invention of a whole new pizza-loving religion." ...|$|E

FYI". During the promotional campaign {{leading up to the}} release of Reclassified, Azalea revealed that she would be collaborating with Ellie Goulding on a track titled [...] "Heavy Crown" [...] featured in the film [...] In October 2014, while giving an interview with Radio.com, Azalea mentioned her longtime desire to work with Goulding, and after meeting her several times, was approached about a song that would eventually become [...] "Heavy Crown". She recalled one meeting, [...] "she played it for me and I was in love with it and just felt it was so kind of appropriate for this to be our collaboration", because it [...] "brings out something different in both artists that you don't usually see." [...] On 14 November, a preview of [...] "Heavy Crown" [...] was uploaded to Azalea's VEVO channel. In December 2014, [...] "Trouble" [...] was announced to be the next single from Reclassified, as opposed to [...] "Heavy Crown".

500|$|... "The Wild and the Innocent" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Writing for The A.V. Club, Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a B-, {{noting that he}} was unsure whether it was [...] "one of the series' very best episodes or one of its very worst". VanDerWerff praised McComb's performance, but felt that Donovan was [...] "a kid playing dress-up as the bad guy"; he also noted the episode's similarity to the works of Flannery O'Connor, and described it as [...] "nicely baroque, filled with lots of <b>nice</b> <b>little</b> moments and characters along the way". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 1 out of 5, describing it as [...] "irritating, poorly cast and terribly written". Gibron felt that the episode's setting [...] "reduces Millennium to a ridiculous movie of the week", adding that the voice-over narration makes it [...] "a chore to sit through". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five, describing it as [...] "a quirky failure". Shearman and Pearson felt that [...] "The Wild and the Innocent" [...] was a [...] "curious mix of the cloyingly sentimental and the unremittingly bleak", finding similarities to the works of Cormac McCarthy; however, they felt {{that it did not}} work well as an episode of Millennium, finding the minimal involvement of the series' main characters and the distinct difference in setting to detract from the episode as a whole.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} many positive reviews. John Preston, writing for The Daily Telegraph, called the episode an [...] "undiluted triumph". Opening his review, he said [...] "last night's episode {{struck me as}} being as close to 50minutes of pure pleasure as you're likely to get on television". He noted the episode's clever tackling of the topical theme of obesity, and its mixture of emotion and special effects. In closing, he said [...] "the dejected critic, denied even the smallest nit to pick, walks glumly away". Scott Matthewman of The Stage lamented that the Adipose were not threatening enough. He liked the Adipose's execution of Miss Foster, a [...] "momentary pause in mid-air, gravity only kicking in when the character looks down", comparing it to Wile E. Coyote and Chuck Jones, which [...] " [...] a <b>nice</b> <b>little</b> touch in an episode... full of them". He also appreciated Tate, saying that [...] "David Tennant finally has a partner who is approaching an equal". [...] Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote that Tate was [...] "not right for this role" [...] and [...] "too hysterical, too comedy, not cool enough", and felt her inclusion {{was an attempt to}} trade on the popularity of her own series and [...] "broaden the appeal of [...] still further". He also found the music [...] "a bit oppressive" [...] but concluded that, despite these criticisms, the show was [...] "still awfully nice television". Keith Watson of Metro gave the episode 4 stars out of 5. He admitted that despite his dislike of Tate, [...] "she isn't that bad". His review of the Adipose was positive, citing them as a reason {{of the quality of the}} show. Closing, he said [...] "it split [...] sides".|$|E

500|$|Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV {{reviewed}} each mobisode. [...] "The Watch" [...] {{was called}} [...] "a fun couple minutes of character work", but [...] "relatively worthless". [...] "The Adventures of Hurley and Frogurt" [...] {{was thought to}} be better than [...] "The Watch". [...] "King of the Castle" [...] was reviewed better than the previous two mobisodes and the reviewer noted that [...] "it's a testament to ... Fox and ... Emerson's acting abilities that [...] is so intense". [...] "The Deal" [...] was said to be even better than [...] "King of the Castle". [...] While Dahl [...] "always like what Juliet brings to the table", he thought that [...] "Operation: Sleeper" [...] "serves little purpose". [...] "Room 23" [...] was called the [...] "best mobisode ever". [...] In regard to [...] "Arzt and Crafts", Dahl wrote that [...] "Lindelof wrote this mobisode ... and as a result ... it has the best dialogue of any mobisode so far". [...] He commented that [...] "Tropical Depression" [...] is [...] "not totally superfluous, though the new information isn't very enlightening". [...] Dahl [...] "liked" [...] "Jack, Meet Ethan. [...] Ethan? [...] Jack", but decided [...] "that it's not 's best work". [...] Dahl wrote that [...] "Jin Has a Temper-Tantrum on the Golf Course" [...] is [...] "a <b>nice</b> <b>little</b> scene", but the reviewer pointed out an inaccuracy in the scene's golf gameplay. [...] When reviewing [...] "The Envelope", Dahl wrote that [...] "The people over at Lost have cheated a little bit ... it's still a pretty cool deleted scene". [...] After seeing [...] "So It Begins", Dahl was [...] "not entirely sure what to think" [...] because the reviewer liked [...] "showing the moments before the pilot began" [...] and [...] "doing a mobisode from Vincent's perspective, but adding a supposed-to-be-dead Christian to the mix is confusing".|$|E
500|$|Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly {{was also}} positive, writing that Beyoncé [...] "pants and sweats and grunts (except, you know, sexy-like), her voice {{climbing}} ever higher {{in search of}} an octave big enough to hold it". Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes wrote that [...] "" [...] if sung by anyone else, 'I Miss You' would be a thin wisp of a ballad, but Beyoncé allows her voice to crack at the right moments, moving tenuously, self-consciously through the soft, circular melody." [...] He concluded that songs like [...] "I Miss You" [...] and [...] "Start Over" [...] would earn deserved spots in [...] "the Beyoncé pantheon" [...] once fans take the time to grow attached to them. Andrew Unterberger of PopCrush praised the way Beyoncé delivers the line [...] "Why is that?", writing that it is [...] "a <b>nice</b> <b>little</b> nod to the confusion of heartbreak, and a rare, welcome glimpse of vulnerability for an artist who too often seems to have all of the answers." [...] Referring to [...] "I Miss You", Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that [...] "the 80s influence is not always a bad thing." [...] He considered the song to be [...] "a woozy update of an old-fashioned slow jam", further stating that [...] "it is probably pushing it a bit to call it an R equivalent of Ariel Pink's hypnagogic pop, but there's something enveloping and dream-like about it." [...] Ian Walker of AbsolutePunk commented that [...] " [...] hollow beat and dismal synthesizers, allow Beyoncé and her morosely beautiful voice center stage. [...] Beyoncé delivers a believable performance effortlessly." [...] By contrast, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune was negative, writing that [...] " [...] easily overlooked with its forlorn keyboard and beat-box chintziness." [...] Similarly, Consequence of Sound writer Chris Coplan felt that the ballad is [...] "too-saccharine-for-its-own-good." [...] The Guardians critics Ben Beaumont Thomas and Rebecca Nicholson ranked [...] "I Miss You" [...] at numbers four and nine respectively on their lists of The 10 Best Tracks of 2011.|$|E
500|$|... "Tallahassee" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many {{noting that the}} Florida story-line gave the series a focus. TV Equals noted that the episode was [...] "one of the best episodes of The Office this the season and [...] {{one of the better}} episodes from the last couple of seasons." [...] Brian Marder from Hollywood.com wrote a largely positive review, noting that [...] "Overall, tonight represented a significant step back in the right direction – and hope that maybe the series still has hope... More promisingly, the humor was top-notch, funnily similar to the effortless comedy of early seasons and refreshingly dissimilar to the forced, uncharacteristic stuff that has pervaded season 8." [...] Bret Davinger from the California Literary Review noted that [...] "A couple of weeks ago, I complained about The Office spending too much time away from the office. How was I to know that taking a trip to Tallahassee would produce probably the best episode of the season and maybe one of the best episodes of the past couple of seasons?" [...] Davinger went on to note that the change in scenery from the office set to Tallahassee was working for the series. In addition, he noted that episode did not feature any hints of Erin's desire to stay in Florida or Cathy's attempt to seduce Jim, a move he hoped would be permanent. [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave awarded the episode an 8 out of 10 and wrote that [...] "between 'Special Project' and 'Tallahassee' it’s fair to say that The Office is on a <b>nice</b> <b>little</b> run. Everything good and funny about last week's episode spilled over to 'Tallahassee'." [...] TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella awarded the episode four out of five stars. Despite praising the episode for coming [...] "together {{as one of the best}} Office episodes of the season," [...] he criticized Dwight's main plot, calling it [...] "not funny." [...] The Filtered Lens reviewer Matt Dougherty called the episode [...] "solid" [...] and noted [...] "While 'Tallahassee' was not quite as good as last week, it still is a step in the right direction for this struggling show." [...] He ultimately awarded the episode a 7 out of 10. Many reviews praised the episode's cold opening, with many critics calling it one of the funniest openings of the eighth season. What Culture! reviewer Jeffrey Kratzer, despite awarding the episode three out of five stars, wrote, Tallahassee' was so enjoyable (for the most part) that [...] next few episodes look to be the excitement and focused momentum we've been waiting for all season." ...|$|E
