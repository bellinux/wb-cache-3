30|$|To {{show this}} we {{simulated}} 10, 000 randomly generated OFDM symbols with 64 subcarriers, each modulated with 16 -QAM, using a MATLAB simulation. The clipping ratio {{is defined as}} the ratio <b>of</b> the <b>clipping</b> threshold A to the root mean square (RMS) value σ of the OFDM signal. The clipping threshold was varied from 0.4 to 0.7 which correspond to a <b>clipping</b> ratio <b>of</b> between approximately 1.01 and 1.79 since the average power of the OFDM signal was 0.156 over the 10, 000 symbols. The range <b>of</b> <b>clipping</b> thresholds therefore encompasses mild to very severe clipping. For each clipping threshold we recorded the average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> correctly snapped constellation symbols and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>clipped</b> time-domain samples.|$|R

5000|$|The {{format of}} the series {{is similar to that}} of some of Brooker's other works, such as the {{abovementioned}} Screenwipe and Charlie Brooker's Weekly Wipe, with Brooker effectively narrating from a living room set while watching TV.

Each episode is loosely chronological, starting with earlier TV programmes and adverts, with Brooker commenting on the changes in these over time. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>clips</b> relevant to the subject and time period at hand are shown, which Brooker usually criticises for being hyperbolic or overly fanciful. Each episode contains a few sketches or fake news broadcasts satirising a particular aspect of the topic discussed. For example, in the first episode, Fear, there is a sketch parodying hyperbolic disaster docudramas, wherein mundane items - first pens, then keyboards, then people's 'voices' - begin to get [...] "hot", scalding their users and plunging the Earth into a new dark age before causing it to explode.
