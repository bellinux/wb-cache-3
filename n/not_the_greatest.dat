The episode was also significant because it featured an on-screen kiss by Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany (Heather Morris), which was the show's first lesbian kiss.|$|E
5|$|The Rights of Men indicts monarchy and {{hereditary}} distinctions {{and promotes}} a republican ideology. Relying on 17th- and early 18th-century notions of republicanism, Wollstonecraft maintains that virtue {{is at the}} core of citizenship. However, her notion of virtue is more individualistic and moralistic than traditional Commonwealth ideology. The goals of Wollstonecraft's republicanism are the happiness and prosperity of the individual, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> good for the greatest number or the greatest benefits for the propertied. While she emphasizes the benefits that will accrue to the individual under republicanism, she also maintains that reform can only be effected at a societal level. This marks a change from her earlier texts, such as Original Stories from Real Life (1788), in which the individual plays the primary role in social reform.|$|E

25|$|The longest {{successful}} post-war breakaway by {{a single}} rider was by Albert Bourlon in the 1947 Tour de France. In the stage Carcassone-Luchon, he stayed away for 253km. It was one of seven breakaways longer than 200km, the last being Thierry Marie's 234km escape in 1991. Bourlon finished 16m 30s ahead. This {{is one of the}} biggest time gaps but <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest.</b> That record belongs to José-Luis Viejo, who beat the peloton by 22m 50s in the 1976 stage Montgenèvre-Manosque.

25|$|Throughout the 18th century, the {{appreciation}} of Bach's music was mostly limited to distinguished connoisseurs. The 19th century started with the first biography of the composer being published and ended with {{the completion of the}} publication of all of Bach's known works by the Bach Gesellschaft. A Bach Revival had started from Mendelssohn's performance of the St. Matthew Passion in 1829. Soon after that performance, Bach started to become {{regarded as one of the}} greatest composers of all times, if <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest,</b> a reputation he has retained ever since.

For long periods Tipp looked like they were going to end the reign of Brian Cody's side. Tipperary had to play almost twenty minutes with fourteen men following the dismissal of Benny Dunne, and their resolve was finally broken in the final stages, when late goals from Henry Shefflin and substitute Martin Comerford finally killed off their heroic efforts to secure a 2-22 to 0-23 victory.|$|E

500|$|While Johnny Depp was Burton's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Ichabod Crane, Paramount {{required}} him to consider Brad Pitt, Liam Neeson and Daniel Day-Lewis. Depp was cast in July 1998 for his third collaboration with Burton. The actor wanted Ichabod to parallel Irving's description of the character in the short story. This included a long prosthetic snipe nose, huge ears, and elongated fingers. Paramount turned down his suggestions, and after Depp read Tom Stoppard's rewrite of the script, he was inspired to take the character even further. [...] "I always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl," [...] Depp explained. He did not wish to portray the character as a typical action star would have, and instead took inspiration by Angela Lansbury's performance in Death on the Nile. [...] "It's good," [...] Burton reasoned, [...] "because I'm <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> action director in the world, and he's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> action star." [...] Depp modeled Ichabod's detective personality from Basil Rathbone in the 1939 Sherlock Holmes film series. He also studied Roddy McDowall's acting for additional influence. Burton added that [...] "the idea was to try to find an elegance in action of the kind that Christopher Lee or Peter Cushing or Vincent Price had." [...] Christina Ricci, who worked with producer Scott Rudin on The Addams Family, was cast as Katrina Van Tassel. Sleepy Hollow also reunited Burton with Jeffrey Jones (from Beetlejuice and Ed Wood) as Reverend Steenwyck, Christopher Walken (Max Schreck in Batman Returns) as the Hessian Horseman, Martin Landau (Ed Wood) in a cameo role, and Hammer veteran Michael Gough (Alfred in Burton's Batman films), whom Burton tempted out of retirement. The Hammer influence was further confirmed by the casting of Christopher Lee in a small role as the Burgomaster who sends Crane to Sleepy Hollow.|$|E
500|$|In {{comparing}} Olivier and {{the other}} leading actors of his generation, Ustinov wrote, [...] "It is of course vain to talk of who is and who is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> actor. There is simply {{no such thing as}} a greatest actor, or painter or composer". Nonetheless, some colleagues, particularly film actors such as Spencer Tracy, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, came to regard Olivier as the finest of his peers. Peter Hall, though acknowledging Olivier as the head of the theatrical profession, thought Richardson the greater actor. Others, such as the critic Michael Coveney, awarded the palm to Gielgud. Olivier's claim to theatrical greatness lay not only in his acting, but as, in Hall's words, [...] "the supreme man of the theatre of our time", pioneering Britain's National Theatre. As Bragg identified, [...] "no one doubts that the National is perhaps his most enduring monument".|$|E

Warren recalls that although Ashley [...] "was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> actress, she was very enthusiastic and very easy to work with." [...] The professional relationship between Warren and Clarke broke down during the filming of sequences such as Dean's incapacitation inside the caves, when the director and actor disagreed {{about the extent to}} which Clarke needed to respond to the script when his character raises his voice to a shout. Warren asserts that Clarke's [...] "high opinion of himself" [...] made the actor [...] "a nightmare to work with", and adds that he [...] "could be extremely difficult, making every scene with him an uphill struggle." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the singer}} has never {{mentioned}} physical abuse in her family, she had mentioned {{that her father}} was a disciplinarian and her stepmother was hard on her. Author Lucy O'Brien wrote in her book Madonna: Like an Icon that the song stemmed more from the emotional neglect that Madonna faced, with her father locked up in grief after Mrs. Ciccone died. When he married again, his new wife was wrapped up with her own children, so the older kids were often left to their own devices. O'Brien believed that for this reason, Madonna's girlhood would have been without much joy, and that [...] "Oh Father" [...] was a potent example of the singer using her imagination to escape from her troubled childhood, while blaming it on her father. Tony later said, [...] "Maybe I'm <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> father in the world, but life wasn't easy for us, and Nonni [...] knows all of this." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{consumer}} {{magazines and}} newspapers generally gave Gone with the Wind excellent reviews. However, while its production values, technical achievements, and scale of ambition were universally recognized, some reviewers of the time found the film to be too long and dramatically unconvincing. Frank S. Nugent for The New York Times best summed up the general sentiment by acknowledging that while {{it was the most}} ambitious film production made up to that point, it probably was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> film ever made, but he nevertheless found it to be an [...] "interesting story beautifully told". Franz Hoellering of The Nation was of the same opinion: [...] "The result is a film which is a major event {{in the history of the}} industry but only a minor achievement in motion-picture art. There are moments when the two categories meet on good terms, but the long stretches between are filled with mere spectacular efficiency." ...|$|E

500|$|Delius's first orchestral {{compositions}} were, in Christopher Palmer's words, {{the work}} of [...] "an insipid if charming water-colourist". The Florida Suite (1887, revised 1889) is [...] "an expertly crafted synthesis of Grieg and Negroid Americana", while Delius's first opera Irmelin (1890–92) lacks any identifiably Delian passages. Its harmony and modulation are conventional, and the work bears the clear fingerprints of Wagner and Grieg. Payne asserts {{that none of the}} works prior to 1895 are of lasting interest. The first noticeable stylistic advance is evident in Koanga (1895–97), with richer chords and faster harmonic rhythms; here we find Delius [...] "feeling his way towards the vein that he was soon to tap so surely". In Paris (1899), the orchestration owes a debt to Richard Strauss; its passages of quiet beauty, says Payne, nevertheless lack the deep personal involvement of the later works. Paris, the final work of Delius's apprentice years, is described by Foss as [...] "one of the most complete, if <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest,</b> of Delius's musical paintings".|$|E
500|$|In June 1927 Gernsback {{published}} Amazing Stories Annual, {{twice the}} size (and twice the price) of the regular Amazing Stories. [...] It carried a new Mars novel, The Mastermind of Mars, by Edgar Rice Burroughs, which Burroughs {{had been unable to}} sell elsewhere, perhaps because it contained satirical elements aimed at religious fundamentalism. [...] Burroughs' name was a powerful aid to sales, and since Gernsback had secured two stories by Abraham Merritt, who was also very popular, the magazine sold out all 150,000 copies, despite the high price. [...] This success convinced Gernsback to launch another science fiction title, and the first issue of Amazing Stories Quarterly appeared in 1928 with a Spring cover date. [...] In the same year Gernsback printed E.E. Smith's first novel, in Amazing, titled The Skylark of Space. [...] It was enormously successful, and on the strength of Smith's Skylark series of novels, and his later Lensman series, Smith became [...] "one of the greatest names, if <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> of all" [...] to sf readers of the 1930s.|$|E
