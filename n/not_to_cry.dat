5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} her resistance to pain he would drop hot sealing wax {{on her back and}} arms or stick pins in her, commanding her <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> out. He would test her ability to keep secrets by telling her that his life was in danger and she should tell no one. To increase her resistance to the cold, Day instructed Sabrina to wade into Stowe Pool until the water reached her neck, then lie in the nearby meadow until her clothes and hair had dried in the sun. Finally, to test her resistance to luxury, he gave her a big box of handmade silk clothes and had her throw them on a fire. Day had limited success with these techniques. Sabrina became able to endure hot wax dripped on her arm without flinching, but she did tell others of his secret techniques, and could not help screaming whenever he fired his gun at her.|$|E

His father finds himself re-examining his life and seeing it more the result of random chance and accident than any ability on his part. Beth tries to control it like everything else in her life. She and Conrad were, Calvin notes, the only people <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> at Buck's funeral.|$|E

500|$|Kate McCann's {{appearance}} and demeanour were widely discussed, {{with much of}} the commentary coming from other women, including Booker Prize-winner Anne Enright in the London Review of Books. Kate was deemed cold and controlled, too attractive, too thin, too well-dressed, too intense. She had apparently been advised by abduction experts <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> on camera because the kidnapper might enjoy her distress, and this led to more criticism: the Portuguese tabloid Correio da Manhã cited sources complaining that she had not [...] "shed a single tear". Journalism professor Nicola Goc argued that Kate had joined a long list of mothers deemed killers because of unacceptable maternal behaviour. Commentators compared her experience to that of Lindy Chamberlain, convicted of murder after her baby was killed by a dingo. Like Kate, she was suspected, in part, because she did not weep in public. There was even a similar (false) story about supposedly relevant Bible passages the women were said to have highlighted. Chamberlain asked: [...] "How can you apologise to me and do this again to someone else?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the song comes from an epitaph on a plaque at Eva Perón's grave in the La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires. The plaque was {{presented}} by the city's taxi drivers' union and roughly translates as: [...] "Don't cry for me Argentina, I remain quite near to you." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote [...] "For years I have wondered, during 'Don't Cry for Me, Argentina,' why we were <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b> Now I understand: We need not cry because (a) Evita got everything out of life she dreamed of, and (b) Argentina should cry for itself. Even poor Juan Peron [...] should shed a tear or two; he is relegated...to {{the status of a}} 'walker,' a presentable man who adorns the arm of a rich and powerful woman as a human fashion accessory." [...] The song's lyrics are a [...] "string of meaningless platitudes" [...] according to Rice, who felt that it worked as an emotionally intense but empty speech by a [...] "megalomaniac woman" [...] trying to win the favor of the Argentines. It features the lyrics [...] "And as for fortune, and as for fame / I never invited them in / Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired / They are illusions".|$|E

500|$|Cruz {{has donated}} {{money and time}} to charity. In {{addition}} to work in Nepal, she has volunteered in Uganda and India, where she spent a week working with Mother Teresa that included assisting in a leprosy clinic. That trip inspired Cruz to help start a foundation to support homeless girls in India, where she sponsors two young women. She donated her salary from her first Hollywood film, The Hi-Lo Country, to Mother Teresa's mission. In the early 2000s, she spent time in Nepal photographing Tibetan children for an exhibition attended by the Dalai Lama. She also photographed residents at the Pacific Lodge Boys' Home, {{most of whom are}} former gang members and recovering substance abusers. She said: [...] "These kids break my heart. I have to control myself <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b> Not out of pity, but seeing how tricky life is and {{how hard it is to}} make the right choices." [...] A pregnant Cruz showed her support for the battle against AIDS by lighting up the Empire State Building with red lights in New York City on 1 December 2010 on International AIDS Day, as part of (RED)'s new awareness campaign, 'An AIDS Free Generation is Due in 2015,' which aims to eradicate the HIV virus from pregnant mothers to their babies. [...] In 2012, she posed for an ad supporting PETA's anti-fur campaign.|$|E
500|$|After Gilly {{eventually}} {{starts a}} relationship with Steph, she is diagnosed with cervical cancer and initially keeps the news a secret from him. Stenson spoke of Steph's reasoning stating: [...] "With Gilly, she's embarrassed and doesn't want him to look after her." [...] Speaking of the storyline Quinlan stated during an interview with Inside Soap: [...] "I think Gilly's really gutted that he didn't get together with Steph sooner - he wasted so much time with Cheryl and Jem, when really {{he was in love}} with her." [...] At one point Steph cancels her wedding to Gilly because he cannot accept she is dying, of this Quinlan states: [...] "His denial is not helping her. She's tying to take this in her stride and wants to spend quality time with the people she loves before she goes. She tells him he has to accept she's going to die or the wedding is off. and she hands back her engagement ring." [...] Quinlan has also stated he was eager for the pair to marry because of the [...] "tear jerking" [...] scenes it would create. Steph is killed off during a special week of episodes dubbed [...] "fire week". The cast filmed many stunts themselves, and Quinlan filmed scenes in front of a burning set, and he stated he [...] "was very manly about it" [...] whilst filming a ladder rescue scene. Gilly's immediate grief resulted in the characters name trending on Twitter, of this Quinlan stated: [...] "So glad that the ep had the impact that was desired! Buzzing Gilly is trended again!" [...] Gilly's grief is made worse because of Steph making the decision to die prematurely. Conversing this Quinlan said: [...] "He's grieving - he just can't understand why she took her life like that." [...] He added that Gilly's grief turns to anger because he cannot get the answers to his questions. Quinlan opined that he wanted Gilly to take a different root stating: [...] "I'd like to see Gilly go down a bit of a different route because he’s been a bit of a push-over in the past. I'd like to see his character progress a bit more and I'd like to see a side of him that we haven't seen before." [...] Gilly's grief then continued to get worse with Quinlan adding: [...] "The poor guy's heading off on a very dark journey that I'm sure he'll live to regret." [...] As Gilly is still so angry, at Steph's funeral, the director of the episode asked Quinlan <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> at all during the ceremony. Quinlan added [...] "It was all so heartfelt, though, that I broke down for real a few times - and I think that's going to come across in the final episode." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the trials, Jesus {{made his}} way to Calvary (the path is {{traditionally}} called via Dolorosa) and the three synoptic gospels indicate that he was assisted by Simon of Cyrene, the Romans compelling him to do so. In [...] Jesus tells the women in multitude of people following him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> for him but for themselves and their children. Once at Calvary (Golgotha), Jesus was offered wine mixed with gall to drink— usually offered as a form of painkiller. Matthew's and Mark's gospels state that he refused this.|$|E

Kay pushes the horses into a race, knocking Gerda off the sled, but she tries <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b> Kay ties his sled to the sleigh of the Snow Queen, which has suddenly appeared, to Gerda's horror. The Snow Queen pulls Kay on his sled out of the city, where she stops and confronts him, taking him into her arms as her willing captive, since his heart is as cold as ice. The Snow Queen's presence freezes a mother bird to death as she protects her young under her. These young birds will appear later in the story.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the request}} of Liz Kirschner, wife of film {{producer}} David Kirschner, he obtained the role of Cornelius in 20th Century Fox's animated film Once Upon a Forest, which was produced by David Kirschner. During his voice over sessions, Michael stated {{that he had a}} terrible time singing one of the musical numbers called [...] "Please Wake Up". This was because he had to struggle <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> when this was being completed, as the scenario was that his character Cornelius was singing to a child who {{was on the verge of}} death. The film was released in cinemas over the summer of 1993. 1993 also saw the release of his special, A Touch of Music In The Night, to coincide with the release of his new album of the same name.|$|E
