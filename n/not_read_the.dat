5|$|After Australia {{ended with}} 509 {{and took a}} 334-run lead, Tallon took two {{difficult}} catches to dismiss key batsmen {{at the start of}} England's second innings. Miller removed Cyril Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot to Tallon. Bill Edrich was then caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson. He did <b>not</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> arm ball that went straight on and the ball took the outside edge, leaving England at 2/39. He thus helped Australia to seize the initiative by denying England a good start, but they recovered. Later, he caught Godfrey Evans for 50 from Johnson as England ended at 441. Australia reached their target of 98 with two wickets down, completing an eight-wicket victory. Tallon conceded five and 12 byes in the two innings respectively.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the pre-production phase, Carter and Bowman were busy with the television series, leaving Sackheim to work alone. Sackheim hired executive producer Lata Ryan, who had previously collaborated with Steven Spielberg for his 1993 film, Jurassic Park. Once hired, Ryan was allowed to read the script in front of the Ten Thirteen Productions staff members—but not to take it away. At this time, most of the staff members had <b>not</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> script for themselves. After Ryan accepted the offer of becoming executive producer, Chris Nowak was hired as production designer, Ward Russell as director of photography and Bill Liams as construction coordinator. According to Ryan, they had secured all key personnel six weeks before principal filming began.|$|E
5|$|England {{began their}} second innings {{on the third}} afternoon. Late in the day, after scoring 13 in 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind by Don Tallon after {{attempting}} a cut shot from Johnson’s bowling. Edrich did <b>not</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> arm ball, which went straight on and took the outside edge, leaving England at 2/39. Denis Compton came in and he ran down the pitch before the first ball was bowled; he had to quickly block {{the ball on the}} run. He then survived a confident lbw appeal from the bowling of Johnson when he was on eight. Compton appeared resigned to his fate and ready to walk, but umpire Frank Chester declined the appeal. During this passage of play, Johnson extracted a substantial amount of spin from the surface. England closed the day at 2/121.|$|E

50|$|According to Tom Fortunato, one of {{the extras}} on the set, told The Westfield Leader (newspaper for Westfield, New Jersey) that despite <b>not</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> script, he feels that {{production}} will be similar to Richard Elfman's 1980 cult classic The Forbidden Zone.|$|R
5|$|Four of {{the first}} five runs were leg byes; Miller then removed Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot that was caught by Tallon. The batsman was displeased with the umpire's {{decision}} and gestured to a red mark on his shirt, indicating he felt the ball had touched his body and not the bat. Edrich came in and while he continued to struggle, he defiantly held up {{his end of the}} pitch. After scoring 13 from 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson. He did <b>not</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> arm ball, which went straight on and took the outside edge, leaving England 39/2. Johnson was extracting a substantial amount of spin from the surface.|$|E
5|$|Tom Kenderson (Alan Autry), an {{old friend}} and {{baseball}} teammate of bartender Sam Malone (Ted Danson), announces in his forthcoming autobiography that he is homosexual. At a press conference held at the bar, Sam, having <b>not</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> book in advance, is shocked about Tom's revelation. Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) helps Sam to calm down, and they discuss Tom. Moments later, Sam publicly accepts and supports Tom and his sexuality, which local newspapers report on their front pages. The next day, as they read the newspaper, the bar's regular patronsincluding Norm (George Wendt)express their disdain toward homosexuals and their worries that Sam's support for his old friend will turn Cheers into a gay bar. Diane criticizes their homophobia and says that there are actually two gay men in the bar.|$|E
5|$|Even after publication, the book's status {{remained}} vague {{because the}} king had not given his full support to it. In a draft letter, Henry noted that he had <b>not</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> book, but supported its printing. His attention was most likely occupied by the pregnancy of Jane Seymour {{and the birth of}} the male heir, Edward, that Henry had sought for so long. Jane died shortly after giving birth and her funeral was held on 12 November. That month Henry started to work on the Bishops' Book; his amendments were sent to Cranmer, Sampson, and others for comment. Cranmer's responses to the king were far more confrontational than his colleagues' and he wrote at much greater length. They reveal unambiguous statements supporting reformed theology such as justification by faith or sola fide (faith alone) and predestination. However, his words did not convince the king. A new statement of faith would be delayed until 1543 with the publication of the King's Book.|$|E

5|$|When Universal {{cancelled}} King Kong in 1997, Jackson and Walsh immediately received {{support from}} Weinstein {{and began a}} six-week process of sorting out the rights. Jackson and Walsh asked Costa Botes to write a synopsis {{of the book and}} they began to re-read the book. Two to three months later, they had written their treatment. The first film would have dealt with what would become , , and the beginning of , ending with Saruman's death, and Gandalf and Pippin going to Minas Tirith. In this treatment, Gwaihir and Gandalf visit Edoras after escaping Saruman, Gollum attacks Frodo when the Fellowship is still united, and Farmer Maggot, Glorfindel, Radagast, Elladan and Elrohir are present. Bilbo attends the Council of Elrond, Sam looks into Galadriel's mirror, Saruman is redeemed before he dies and the Nazgûl just make it into Mount Doom before they fall. They presented their treatment to Harvey and Bob Weinstein, the latter of whom they focused on impressing with their screenwriting as he had <b>not</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> book. They agreed upon two films and a total budget of $75million.|$|E
5|$|Wyler felt Tunberg's {{draft was}} too much of a {{morality}} play overlaid with current Western political overtones, and that the dialogue was too modern-sounding. Zimbalist brought in playwright S. N. Behrman (who also wrote the script for Quo Vadis) and then playwright Maxwell Anderson to write drafts. Gore Vidal biographer Fred Kaplan states that British poet and playwright Christopher Fry was hired simultaneously with Vidal, although most sources (including Vidal himself) state that Vidal followed Anderson, and that Fry did not come aboard until Vidal was close to leaving the picture. Vidal arrived in Rome in early March 1958 to meet with Wyler. Vidal claimed that Wyler had <b>not</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> script, and that when he did so (at Vidal's urging) on his flight from the U.S. to Italy, he was upset with the modernist dialogue. Vidal agreed to work on the script for three months so that he would come off suspension and fulfill his contract with MGM, although Zimbalist pushed him to stay throughout the entire production. Vidal was researching a book on the 4th century Roman emperor Julian and knew a great deal about ancient Rome.|$|E
