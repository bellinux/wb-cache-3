5|$|The poem {{discusses}} {{the nature of}} time and what humanity's place is within time. Life is described metaphorically as travelling in a boat and humanity's fixation on science and future gain keeping the travellers from reaching their destination. Within the poem, Eliot invokes the image of Krishna to emphasise the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the divine will instead of seeking personal gain.|$|E
5|$|At the school, {{they find}} a secure {{building}} and leave Randall there with a knife. As they leave, Randall pleads to take them back, and then says {{he had gone to}} school with Maggie Greene (Lauren Cohan) and knows her father Hershel (Scott Wilson), suggesting he knows the farm's location. Shane prepares to kill Randall, but Rick tackles him. During the fight that follows, Rick is able to defeat Shane, who angrily breaks a window that releases a horde of walkers in the building. Shane takes safety in a school bus while Rick rescues Randall back to their vehicle. After contemplating leaving Shane, Rick returns to help Shane get to safety as well. They regag Randall and return to the farm. Rick tells Shane that he will <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> his orders to remain part of the group.|$|E

His real interest lay in the instantaneous transformation of live instrumental sounds but the technology did not become available until the late 1970s and the founding of IRCAM. Before then he composed two short pieces on tape (the Deux Etudes of 1951, withdrawn) and a large-scale piece for live orchestra with tape, Poésie pour pouvoir (1958), but he disliked {{the fact that the}} orchestra was straitjacketed by the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the tape and never returned to the piece.|$|E

Infighting between good people begins, ultimately leading to the destruction of the Yadava dynasty. The end comes through a senseless but brutal internecine war, described as a drunken fight, which kills all the Yadavas along with Krishna's human form. The last chapter describes Krishna's ascent to Vaikuntha. Book eleven also includes the so-called Uddhava Gita, the last discourse of Krishna which he addresses to Uddhava. Book 11 section 7-9 discusses the pastimes and realizations of an Avadhuta.|$|E
25|$|In {{compliance}} with the Supreme Court order of 15 April 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests has constituted a panel for deciding {{the best course of}} action in translocation of animals to Gir. The panel comprises 12 members including member secretary National Tiger Conservation Authority, the Chief Wildlife Wardens of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, member Wildlife Institute of India, and scientists Drs Ravi Chellam, Y.V. Jhala, NK Ranjeet Singh and PR Sinha. The panel will advice both the states on technical aspect of transloction, decide the composition of animals to be translocated, select the prides and animals, supervise the translocation, monitor it and periodically report to the Ministry. During the first deliberations on 29 July 2013, the panel acceded the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the recent IUCN translocation guidelines but brushed aside Gujarat's objections against the process. A two-member team comprising Dr Ravi Chellam and Dr Y.V. Jhala has been set up to decide the translocation protocol and report within six weeks.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union {{denied the}} {{existence}} of the secret protocols to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, even though they were widely published by western scholars after surfacing during the Nuremberg Trials. Soviet propaganda also maintained that there was no occupation and that all three Baltic states voluntarily joined the Union – the People's Parliaments expressed people's will when they petitioned the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to be admitted into the Union. The Baltic states claimed that they were forcefully and illegally incorporated into the Soviet Union. Popular opinion was that the secret protocols proved that the occupation was illegal. Such an interpretation of the Pact had major implications in the Baltic public policy. If Baltic diplomats could link the Pact and the occupation, they could claim that the Soviet rule in the republics had no legal basis and therefore all Soviet laws were null and void since 1940. Such a position would automatically terminate the debate over reforming Baltic sovereignty or establishing autonomy within the Soviet Union – the states never de jure belonged to the union in the first place. This would open the possibility of restoring legal continuity of the independent states that existed in the interwar period. Claiming all Soviet laws had no legal power in the Baltics would also cancel the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the Constitution of the Soviet Union and other formal secession procedures.|$|E

Jennifer Konerman of The Hollywood Reporter called the video [...] "timely" [...] and its contents [...] "especially relevant considering the storyline" [...] of Civil War. Three days later, a teaser debuted during Super Bowl 50, which received the most social media activity out of all the film trailers released that day. Anthony Breznican of Entertainment Weekly said the footage [...] "actually feels a little more like a teaser , since it shows some new shots, but really doesn’t reveal much more about the story." [...] Additionally, he felt the chanting [...] "unseen voices calling out, 'United...We...Stand' and 'Divided...We...Fall'" [...] had [...] "a football stadium vibe", complimenting it appearing during the Super Bowl. Mendelson added that Marvel did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the model used for The Winter Soldier during Super Bowl XLVIII of showing a longer trailer after the teaser since Civil War was [...] "frankly [...] higher-profile sequel." [...] Overall, Mendelson felt the spot was [...] "only a little less low-key and small(er)-scale as the trailer that debuted in" [...] November 2015, and sold the [...] "real world" [...] aspect [...] "with character drama and mostly real-world action between would-be superheroes." ...|$|E
