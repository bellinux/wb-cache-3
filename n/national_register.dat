5|$|Although not {{described}} in detail in the 1966 act, SHPOs eventually became integral {{to the process of}} listing properties on the <b>National</b> <b>Register.</b> The 1980 amendments of the 1966 law further defined the responsibilities of SHPOs concerning the <b>National</b> <b>Register.</b> Several 1992 amendments of the NHPA added a category to the <b>National</b> <b>Register,</b> known as Traditional Cultural Properties: those properties associated with Native American or Hawaiian groups.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the two types of}} classification within historic districts, properties listed on the <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> of Historic Places are classified into five broad categories. They are, building, structure, site, district and object; each one has a specific definition in relation to the <b>National</b> <b>Register.</b> All but the eponymous district category are also applied to historic districts listed on the <b>National</b> <b>Register.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> of Historic Places (NRHP) is the United States federal government's {{official}} list of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects deemed worthy of preservation.

5|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> of Historic Places {{has grown}} {{considerably}} from its legislative origins in 1966. In 1986, citizens and groups nominated 3,623 separate properties, sites, and districts for inclusion on the <b>National</b> <b>Register,</b> {{a total of}} 75,000 separate properties. Of the {{more than one million}} properties on the <b>National</b> <b>Register,</b> 80,000 are listed individually. Others are listed as contributing members within historic districts.|$|E
5|$|To {{administer}} {{the newly created}} <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> of Historic Places, the National Park Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior, with director George B. Hartzog Jr., established an administrative division named the Office of Archeology and Historic Preservation (OAHP). Hartzog charged OAHP with creating the <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> program mandated by the 1966 law. Ernest Connally was the Office's first director. Within OAHP new divisions were created {{to deal with the}} <b>National</b> <b>Register.</b> The division administered several existing programs, including the Historic Sites Survey and the Historic American Buildings Survey, as well as the new <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> and Historic Preservation Fund.|$|E

5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> of Historic Places. The <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E
5|$|For a {{property}} {{to be eligible}} for the <b>National</b> <b>Register,</b> it must meet {{at least one of the}} four <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> main criteria.

Each nomination contains a narrative section that provides a detailed physical description of the property and justifies why it is significant historically with regard either to local, state, or national history. The four <b>National</b> <b>Register</b> of Historic Places criteria are the following.|$|E
