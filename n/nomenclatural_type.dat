Prochlorococcus PCC 9511 differs from the latter in possessing horseshoe-shaped thylakoids, exhibiting a low chlorophyll b(2) content and lacking phycoerythrin, but shares these phenotypic properties with Prochlorococcus strain CCMP 1378. This relationship was confirmed by 16 S rRNA sequence analyses, which clearly demonstrated that the axenic isolate is not co-identic with the <b>nomenclatural</b> <b>type.</b> Strain PCC 9511 has a low mean DNA base composition (32 mol% G+C) and harbours the smallest genome of all known oxyphotobacteria (genome complexity 1. 3 GDa = 2 Mbp).

40|$|Type’ {{in biology}} is a polysemous term. In a {{landmark}} article, Paul Farber (Journal of the History of Biology 9 (1) : 93 – 119, 1976) {{argued that this}} deceptively plain term had acquired three different meanings in early nineteenth century natural history alone. ‘Type’ was used in relation to three distinct type concepts, each of them associated with {{a different set of}} practices. Important as Farber’s analysis has been for the historiography of natural history, his account conceals an important dimension of early nineteenth century ‘type talk. ’ Farber’s taxonomy of type concepts passes over the fact that certain uses of ‘type’ began to take on a new meaning in this period. At the closing of the eighteenth century, terms like ‘type specimen,’ ‘type species,’ and ‘type genus’ were universally recognized as referring to typical, model members of their encompassing taxa. But {{in the course of the}} nineteenth century, the same terms were co-opted for a different purpose. As part of an effort to drive out nomenclatural synonymy – the confusing state of a taxon being known to different people by different names – these terms started to signify the fixed and potentially atypical name-bearing elements of taxa. A new type concept was born: the <b>nomenclatural</b> <b>type.</b> In this article, I retrace this perplexing nineteenth century shift in meaning of ‘type. ’ I uncover the nomenclatural disorder that the new <b>nomenclatural</b> <b>type</b> concept dissolved, and expose the conceptual confusion it left in its tracks. What emerges is an account of how synonymy was suppressed through the coinage of a homonym...|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{examination of}} a variety of isolates of the bacterial endoparasite Bdellovibrio has revealed extensive molecular diversity. The quantity of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polynucleotide homology ranges from more than 90 % among the isolates with DNA containing 50 to 51 % guanine plus cytosine (GC) to undetectable levels between the 43 % GC and 51 % GC isolates. The two isolates with low GC-containing DNA (H-I Bdellovibrio A 3. 12 and UKi 2) have only 16 % DNA homology. H-I Bdellovibrio A 3. 12 and 109 have barely detectable ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) homology, whereas the homology approaches 100 % among all the high GC isolates tested. Cases of high DNA/DNA and DNA/rRNA homologies are reflected in low dissimilarities of enzyme migration patterns in starch gel electrophoresis. The dissimilarities exhibited among the high GC Bdellovibrio isolates are as low as those previously reported for different Escherichia coli strains. The zymograms of H-I Bdellovibrio A 3. 12 and UKi 2 are completely different from each other as well as from all other bdellovibrios (100 % dissimilarity). Genome sizes determined for the representative isolates demonstrate three size ranges which coincide with group differences based on the above measurements. Enzyme assays reveal that all isolates possess a tricarboxylic acid cycle and most contain an alanine and glutamic dehydrogenase. We conclude that the use of bacterial endoparasitism as a defining trait has resulted in a molecularly diverse collection of isolates. It is recommended that the specific epitaph bacteriovorus be used only for the type specimen (Bdellovibrio 100 of Stolp and Starr, 1963) and for other related 50 to 51 % GC isolates. The heterogeneity of the group warrants two new species.

It was isolated from black granules of the discharging sinuses on the lower jaw of a 27 -year-old patient from China. Based on se-quence data of the multiloci of ribosomal DNA (rDNA), {{the ability of the}} isolate to ferment some carbohydrates, as well as analyses of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and D 1 /D 2 hypervariable region of the 28 S ribosomal gene sequences, the isolate was considered by the authors to be sufficiently different to warrant its designation as a new species (2). However, the proposed binomial is not in accordance with the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN) (1) and violates articles 36, 37, 37 A, and 9. 5. Article 36 states that in order to be validly published, a name of a new taxon pub-lished on or after 1 January 1935 must be accompanied by a Latin description or diagnosis. Article 37 requires that publi-cation on or after 1 January 1958 of the name of a new taxon of the rank of family or below is valid only when the nomen-clatural type is indicated. In addition, the <b>nomenclatural</b> <b>type</b> should immediately follow the Latin description and should be given by insertion of the Latin word typus immediately before or after the particulars of the type so designated (article 37 A).

40|$|A phytosociological {{study on}} the most {{extensive}} dry grassland communities of the coastal limestone massif of the Ausoni-Aurunci mountains (southern Latium, central Italy) is here presented. Violo pseudogracilis-Koelerietum splendentis ass. nova is restricted to the montane belt of the Aurunci mountains where it is dynamically related to the mesophilous Ostrya carpinifolia or Fagus sylvatica woodlands. Helichryso italici-Brometum erecti ass. nova is found within the upper hilly and submontane belt of both the Ausoni mountains (typical aspect) and the Aurunci mountains (subassociation saturejetosum montanae), where it is dynamically related with termophilous Ostrya carpinifolia woods and mesophilous Quercus ilex woods. Helichryso-Brometum is differentiated from Violo-Koelerietum in {{that it has a}} higher incidence of the steno-Mediterranean therophytic component. As far as the higher rank syntaxa are concerned, in this study the following changes were made in accordance with the rules of ICPN: the name Phleo ambigui-Bromion erecti Biondi et al. 1995 was considered invalid due to the invalidity of its <b>nomenclatural</b> <b>type</b> Asperulo purpureae-Brometum erecti. In contrast, the validity of the old name Cytiso spinescentis-Bromion erecti Bonin 1978 was demonstrated and its <b>nomenclatural</b> <b>type,</b> Lavandulo-Asphodelinetum luteae Bonin 1978, was lectotypified. Thus Cytiso spinescenti-Bromion erecti Bonin 1978 henceforth substitutes Phleo ambigui-Bromion erecti (nom. inval.) as the syntaxonomical reference for the endemic alliance of the hilly and montane limestone dry grasslands of the central and southern Apennines. Cytiso-Bromion is here divided into two suballiances: Sideritidenion italicae Biondi et al. 1995, Phleo ambigui-Bromenion erecti Biondi et al. ex Di Pietro suball. nov. Cytiso-Bromion belong to the new suborder Festuco circummediterraneae- Seslerienalia nitidae (Ubaldi 2003) stat. nov. and to the order Artemisio albae-Brometalia erecti Ubaldi ex Mucina & Dengler 2009. New and updated packages of characteristic and differential species for both Cytiso spinescenti-Bromion erecti and its related suballiances are proposed. Furthermore the validity of the name Astragaletum calabrici Giacomini & Gentile ex Bonin 1978, was proved and the association lectotypified. This association, which was previously included in Cytiso-Bromion erecti, is moved into Koelerio brutiae-Astragalion calabrici.
