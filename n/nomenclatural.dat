5|$|The {{species has}} an uneventful <b>nomenclatural</b> history: {{it has no}} synonyms, and no {{subspecies}} or varieties have been published.|$|E
5|$|No {{subspecies}} or {{varieties of}} Banksia verticillata have been identified; {{it has no}} taxonomic synonyms; and its only <b>nomenclatural</b> synonym is Sirmuellera verticillata (R.Br.) Kuntze, which arose from Otto Kuntze's unsuccessful 1891 attempt to replace Banksia with the new name Sirmuellera.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} an uneventful <b>nomenclatural</b> history: {{it has no}} synonyms, and no {{subspecies}} or varieties have been published. It bears the common names of Matchstick Banksia or Quairading Banksia.|$|E
5|$|Also synonymised {{with this}} species is Adenanthos crenata, {{published}} by Carl Ludwig Willdenow's in Kurt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel's 1825 16th edition of Systema Vegetabilium. Willdenow published both A.cuneata and A.crenata, giving them different descriptions but designating {{the same type}} specimen for both. Thus A.crenata was rejected under the principle of priority, and is now regarded as a <b>nomenclatural</b> synonym of A.cuneatus.|$|E
5|$|Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele {{initiated}} a rearrangement of Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and publishing B.subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's <b>nomenclatural</b> changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B.grossa {{is placed in}} B.subg. Spathulatae.|$|E
5|$|Most species {{historically}} {{named as}} Mycenastrum {{have since been}} transferred to other genera, usually Scleroderma, but also Glyptoderma, Bovista, and Gastropila. Many, including those species {{that have not been}} reclassified are poorly known; the <b>nomenclatural</b> authority Index Fungorum considers only four of these former Mycenastrum species to be currently valid: Bovista bovistoides, B.lycoperdoides, Gastropila fragilis, and Glyptoderma coelatum.|$|E
5|$|Calbovista {{is usually}} {{classified}} in the family Lycoperdaceae, although the <b>nomenclatural</b> status of this group is unclear, as some authorities lump it into the Agaricaceae. By contrast, Sanford Myron Zeller placed Calbovista in Mycenastracae, a family erected by him in 1948 to contain Calbovista and Mycenastrum, two genera united by similarities in capillitial morphology. Mycenastraceae is not currently considered to have independent taxonomic significance and is folded into synonymy with the Agaricaceae.|$|E
5|$|Early in 2007 Mast and Thiele {{initiated}} a rearrangement by transferring Dryandra to Banksia, and publishing B.subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons; {{in this way}} they also redefined the autonym B.subg. Banksia. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's <b>nomenclatural</b> changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. lemanniana is placed in B.subg. Banksia.|$|E
5|$|Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged {{the genus}} Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and {{published}} B.subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons; thus B.subg. Banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's <b>nomenclatural</b> changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B.attenuata {{is placed in}} B.subg. Banksia.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, German {{botanist}} Otto Kuntze published Revisio generum plantarum, {{his response}} to what he perceived {{as a lack of}} method in existing <b>nomenclatural</b> practice. He revived the genus Atylus on the grounds of priority, and correctly made the combination Atylus anemonifolius. However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists. Ultimately, the genus Isopogon was nomenclaturally conserved over Atylus by the International Botanical Congress of 1905.|$|E
5|$|The 1891 {{publication}} Revisio generum plantarum was German botanist Otto Kuntze's {{response to}} what he perceived as poor method in existing <b>nomenclatural</b> practice. Because Isopogon was based on Isopogon anemonifolius, and that species had already been placed by Salisbury in the segregate genus Atylus in 1807, Kuntze revived the latter genus {{on the grounds of}} priority, and made the new combination Atylus anethifolius. However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists. Ultimately, the genus Isopogon was nomenclaturally conserved over Atylus by the International Botanical Congress of 1905.|$|E
5|$|The early {{development}} of cultigen taxonomy follows that of plant taxonomy in general {{as the early}} listing and documentation of plants made little distinction between those that were anthropogenic and those that were natural wild kinds. Formal botanical nomenclature and classification evolved from the simple binomial system of folk taxonomy {{and it was not}} until the mid-19th century that the <b>nomenclatural</b> path of cultigens began to diverge from mainstream plant taxonomy.|$|E
5|$|The first correct {{name was}} {{published}} in 1803 by Heinrich Christian Friedrich Schumacher, who called the species Agaricus cirrhatus. French mycologist Lucien Quélet transferred it to Collybia in 1879, resulting in the binomial by which it is currently known. The species had also been transferred to Microcollybia by Georges Métrod in 1952 and again by Lennox in 1979 (because Métrod's transfer was considered a nomen nudum, and thus invalid according to <b>nomenclatural</b> rules); the genus Microcollybia has since been wrapped into Collybia.|$|E
5|$|The species, {{originally}} named Agaricus marginatus by the Danish naturalist Heinrich Christian Friedrich Schumacher in 1803, {{has several}} synonyms. Elias Magnus Fries renamed it Agaricus aurantio-marginatus in his 1821 Systema Mycologicum, while Christiaan Hendrik Persoon called it Agaricus schumacheri in 1828. Although Schumacher had the earliest publication date, Fries's name is sanctioned, {{and so the}} specific epithet he used is given <b>nomenclatural</b> precedence. French mycologist Lucien Quélet transferred the species to the genus Mycena in 1872. In 1930 Karel Cejp considered {{it to be a}} variety of Mycena elegans.|$|E
5|$|First officially {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 Species Plantarum, Hydnum repandum was sanctioned by Elias Fries in 1821. The species has been shuffled to several genera: Hypothele by Jean-Jacques Paulet in 1812; Dentinum by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821; Tyrodon by Petter Karsten in 1881 Sarcodon by Lucien Quélet in 1886. After a 1977 <b>nomenclatural</b> proposal by mycologist Ronald H. Petersen was accepted, Hydnum repandum became the official type {{species of the}} genus Hydnum. Previously, supporting arguments for making H.repandum the type were made by Marinus Anton Donk (1958) and Petersen (1973), while Zdeněk Pouzar (1958) and Kenneth Harrison (1971) thought that H.imbricatum should be the type.|$|E
5|$|Fries himself {{declined}} {{to keep the}} genus separate, instead classifying Gomphus as a tribus (subgenus) within the genus Cantharellus in his 1821 work Systema Mycologicum, the species becoming Cantharellus clavatus. He recognized four varieties: violaceo-spadiceus, carneus, purpurascens and umbrinus. Swiss mycologist Louis Secretan described three taxa—Merulius clavatus carneus, M.clavatus violaceus and M.clavatus purpurascens—in his 1833 work Mycographie Suisse. Many of his names have been rejected for <b>nomenclatural</b> purposes because Secretan had a narrow species concept, dividing many taxa into multiple species that were not supported by other authorities, and his works did not use binomial nomenclature consistently. Fries revised his classification in his 1838 book Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici seu Synopsis Hymenomycetum, placing it in a series—Deformes—in the genus Craterellus.|$|E
5|$|George's {{arrangement}} remained current until 2007, when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred Dryandra into Banksia. They {{also published}} B.subg. Spathulatae for the Banksia taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons, thus redefining B.subg. Banksia as comprising {{those that do}} not. They were not ready, however, to tender an infrageneric arrangement encompassing Dryandra, so as an interim measure they transferred Dryandra into Banksia at series rank. This minimised the <b>nomenclatural</b> disruption of the transfer, but also caused George's rich infrageneric arrangement to be set aside. Thus under the interim arrangements implemented by Mast and Thiele, B.sessilis is placed in B.subg. Banksia, ser. Dryandra.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Austin Mast, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery {{published}} {{the results of}} their cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for Banksia. They inferred a phylogeny very greatly different from the accepted taxonomic arrangement, including finding Banksia to be paraphyletic with respect to Dryandra. A new taxonomic arrangement was not published at the time, but early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring Dryandra to Banksia, and publishing B.subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's <b>nomenclatural</b> changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B.spinulosa is placed in B.subg. Spathulatae.|$|E

5|$|In their 1914 Flora of Jamaica, William Fawcett and Alfred Barton Rendle linked Sloane's {{illustration}} to {{the tree}} species that was then known as Ficus suffocans, a name that {{had been assigned to}} it in August Grisebach's Flora of the British West Indian Islands. Gordon DeWolf agreed with their conclusion and used the name F. maxima for that species in the 1960 Flora of Panama. Since this use has become widespread, Berg proposed that the name Ficus maxima be conserved in the way DeWolf had used it, a proposal that was accepted by the <b>nomenclatural</b> committee.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the work}} of the {{cultivated}} plant taxonomist is concerned with the naming of plants as prescribed by two plant <b>nomenclatural</b> Codes. The provisions of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Botanical Code) serve primarily scientific ends and the objectives of the scientific community, while those of the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (Cultivated Plant Code) are designed to serve both scientific and utilitarian ends by making provision for the names of plants used in commerce — the cultigens that have arisen in agriculture, forestry and horticulture. These names, sometimes called variety names, are not in Latin but are added onto the scientific Latin names, and they assist communication among the community of foresters, farmers and horticulturists.|$|E
5|$|Paul Kummer raised many of Fries' tribi (subgenera) to genus rank in his 1871 work Der Führer in die Pilzkunde, {{classifying}} the violet chanterelle in {{the genus}} Thelephora. Jacques Emile Doassans and Narcisse Théophile Patouillard {{placed it in}} the genus Neurophyllum (also spelt Nevrophyllum) in 1886, removing it from Cantharellus on account of its orange spores. Charles Horton Peck discarded the name in 1887 and returned G.clavatus to Cantharellus. In 1891, German botanist Otto Kuntze published Revisio generum plantarum, his response to what he perceived as poor method in existing <b>nomenclatural</b> practice. He coined the genus Trombetta to incorporate the violet chanterelle, hence giving it the name Trombetta clavata. However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted {{by the majority of}} botanists.|$|E
5|$|Shaffer {{defined the}} Russula brevipes {{varieties}} acrior and megaspora in 1964 from Californian specimens. The former {{is characterized by}} a greenish-blue band that forms {{at the top of the}} stipe, while the latter variety has large spores. The <b>nomenclatural</b> database Index Fungorum does not consider these varieties to have independent taxonomical significance. In a 2012 publication, mycologist Mike Davis and colleagues suggest that western North American Russula brevipes comprise a complex of at least four distinct species. According to MycoBank, the European species Russula chloroides is synonymous with R.brevipes, although Index Fungorum and other sources consider them distinct species.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, American {{botanist}} Austin Mast {{and co-authors}} have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for Banksia and Dryandra. Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. Banksia aquilonia formed a clade with B.plagiocarpa, B.oblongifolia and B.robur, rather than B.integrifolia. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and published B.subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons; thus B.subg. Banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's <b>nomenclatural</b> changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B.aquilonia {{is placed in}} B.subg. Spathulatae.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, American {{botanist}} Austin Mast {{and co-authors}} have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae, which then comprised genera Banksia and Dryandra. Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. Banksia canei resolves as an early offshoot within the series Salicinae. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and published B.subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons; thus B.subg. Banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's <b>nomenclatural</b> changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B.canei is placed in B.subg. Spathulatae.|$|E
5|$|Stropharia caerulea {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in the scientific literature by James Bolton in 1788, under the name Agaricus politus. This usage is not considered valid according to <b>nomenclatural</b> rules, because it was used by Christian Hendrik Persoon to refer to another species in his 1801 Synopsis methodica fungorum, which is a sanctioned work. Stropharia caerulea was officially described by mycologist Hanns Kreisel in 1979 from collections made near Woldegk, Germany. Machiel Noordeloos transferred the species to Psilocybe in 1995, but today this genus is mostly reserved for species that contain the psychoactive compounds psilocybin and psilocin. Although psilocybin had once been reported from S.caerulea, subsequent analyses have not revealed any traces of the substance in the fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis in 1853. The type collection {{was made by}} American botanist Henry William Ravenel in South Carolina. Joseph Ammirati and Howard Bigelow considered Cortinarius heliotropicus, described by Charles Horton Peck 1914, {{to be the same}} species as C.iodes after examining the holotype specimens of both. According to the <b>nomenclatural</b> databases MycoBank and Index Fungorum, however, Cortinarius iodes does not have any synonyms. If they are indeed the same species, the name C.iodes has priority. C.iodes is classified in the subgenus Myxacium, along with other Cortinarius species that have a slimy cap and stem.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Verbascum has not undergone any significant revision since Svanve Mürbeck's monographies in the 1930s, {{with the exception}} of the work of Arthur Huber-Morath, who used informal group in organizing the genus for the florae of Iran and Turkey to account for many intermediate species. Since Huber-Morath's groups are not taxonomical, Mürbeck's treatment is the most current one available, as no study has yet sought to apply genetic or molecular data extensively to the genus. In Mürbeck's classification, V.thapsus is placed in section Bothrospermae subsect. Fasciculata (or sect. Verbascum subsect. Verbascum depending on <b>nomenclatural</b> choices) alongside species such as Verbascum nigrum (black or dark mullein), Verbascum lychnitis (white mullein) and Verbascum sinuatum (wavy-leaved mullein).|$|E
5|$|This {{arrangement}} remained current until 2007, when botanists Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred Dryandra into Banksia. They {{also published}} B.subgenus Spathulatae for the Banksia taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons, thus redefining the subgenus Banksia as comprising {{those that do}} not. They were not ready, however, to tender an infrageneric arrangement encompassing Dryandra, so as an interim measure they transferred Dryandra into Banksia at series rank. This minimised the <b>nomenclatural</b> disruption of the transfer, but also caused George's rich infrageneric arrangement to be set aside. Thus under the interim arrangements implemented by Mast and Thiele, B.acanthopoda is placed in B.subg. Banksia, ser. Dryandra.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Pacioni and Giorgio Lalli {{described}} the forms roseus and vinosus from Italy in 2003; roseus has a greyish-whitish cap discolouration, while f. vinosus has a less clearly zonate cap that lacks green tones, and gills with a lilac-pinkish sheen. However, form vinosus, originally described by Lucien Quélet as a variety (Lactarius sanguifluus var. vinosus) in 1881, was invalid, because Quélet's basionym was an illegitimate <b>nomenclatural</b> synonym {{of a species}} named in 1855 by Jean-Baptiste Barla. Later authors {{did not agree with}} the delimitation of these forms as distinct taxa, suggesting that the alternations in appearance represent normal morphological variations brought about by differences in age, and environmental factors such as levels of sunlight and humidity. Lactarius vinosus has often been considered as a variety of L.sanguifluus, but morphological (especially macroscopic characters and spore-ornamentation) and molecular evidence (based on internal transcribed spacer-sequencing) has confirmed that they are separate species.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} decades of his careers, Moser sought to clarify the taxonomic {{identity}} of European fungi by collecting specimens to be described as neotypes in the localities studied by Elias Magnus Fries, but this was no longer necessary after changes to <b>nomenclatural</b> rules that took effect in 1981. Among the Agaricales, Moser's interest was primarily in the complex genus Cortinarius. He published book-length works addressing Cortinarius taxa found in Europe and, co-writing with Horak, South America. Moser, working with Joe Ammirati, contributed to research on the genus in North America, and also examined Asian and Australasian taxa. He had a particular interest in Arctic–alpine habitats, and he documented, painted and published on his collections in these and other sites around the world. Moser initially doubted the usefulness of molecular phylogenetic analysis of the Agaricales, but later contributed to research in this area.|$|E
5|$|Reassigning {{the name}} Ficus maxima {{did not leave}} F. aurea as the oldest name for this species, as German naturalist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link had {{described}} Ficus ciliolosa in 1822. Berg concluded that the species Link described was actually F. aurea, and since Link's description predated Nuttall's by 24 years, priority should {{have been given to}} the name F. ciliolosa. Since the former name was widely used and the name F. ciliolosa had not been, Berg proposed that the name F. aurea be conserved. In response to this, the <b>nomenclatural</b> committee ruled that rather than conserving F. aurea, {{that it would be better}} to reject F. ciliolosa. Conserving F. aurea would mean that precedence would be given to that name over all others. By simply rejecting F. ciliolosa, the committee left open the possibility that the name F. aurea could be supplanted by another older name, if one were to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Robert Shaffer defined four {{forms of}} R.densifolia in a 1962 {{monograph}} on section Compactae, differentiating them by spore print color, fruiting pattern, odor, gill spacing, {{and the intensity}} of the color change with bruising. Three forms are from the Pacific Northwest region of North America: form dilatoria has fruit bodies that darken to lavender gray to brownish gray; form fragrans has a fragrant odor and widely spaced gills; form cremeispora produces a light yellow spore print and has an obscurely two-layered cap cuticle. Form gregata, found in the eastern United States, grows gregariously in jack pine and Scotch pine forests. The <b>nomenclatural</b> database Index Fungorum lumps these forms, as well as f. subrubescen, published by Patrick Reumaux in 1996, together into synonymy. Other synonyms include Rolf Singer's 1931 variety caucasica, Roger Heim's 1938 variety latericola, and C. Dagron's 1999 variety colettarum.|$|E
5|$|Russula virescens {{was first}} {{described}} by German polymath Jacob Christian Schaeffer in 1774 as Agaricus virescens. The species was subsequently {{transferred to the}} genus Russula by Elias Fries in 1836. According to the <b>nomenclatural</b> authority MycoBank, Russula furcata var. aeruginosa (published by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1796) and Agaricus caseosus (published by Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wallroth in 1883) are synonyms of Russula virescens. The variety albidocitrina, defined by Claude Casimir Gillet in 1876, is no longer considered to have independent taxonomic significance. According to Rolf Singer's 1986 classification of Russula, R.virescens is the type species of subsection Virescentinae in section Rigidae, a grouping of mushrooms characterized by a cap surface that breaks into patches of bran-like (furfuraceous) particles. In a molecular phylogenetic analysis of European Russula, R.virescens formed a clade with R.mustelina; these two species were sister to a clade containing R.amoenicolor and R.violeipes.|$|E
