40|$|Many perovskite-structured ceramic {{materials}} {{are known to}} have useful microwave dielectric properties, with promising applications in mobile telecommunications, an industry which will be worth an estimated $ 341 billion by 2015. Current mathematical models used to predict the functional properties of specific perovskites are poorly suited to complex or defective structures. In the present study, a solid-state processing method was used to synthesize perovskite ceramics in the system [(Ca,Sr) 1 - 3 n/ 2 Lnn]TiO 3 (Ln = La or Nd). Single-phase powder samples were produced at 1300 ºC and characterized using X-ray diffraction. The resulting products were then uniaxially pressed to form pellets which were sintered at temperatures up to 1600 ºC. This work investigates the effect of point defects on the structure of the resultant perovskites. The ultimate goal is to develop a predictive model, based solely on composition <b>and</b> <b>easily-obtainable</b> published reference data, for the effect of point defects on the structure and, by extension, dielectric properties of perovskites...|$|R

Rat CBF values, which were noninvasively quantified using chest dynamic planar imaging and head SPECT, were {{nearly identical to}} conventionally determined rat CBF using arterial blood and brain sampling. These findings indicate that rat CBF could be <b>noninvasively</b> <b>and</b> quantitatively assessed by combining 99 mTc-HMPAO-planar imaging and SPECT, thereby avoiding arterial blood sampling.|$|R

40|$|The common {{procedure}} for detecting potentially malignant (PMOL) or malignant oral lesions consists of visual inspection, followed by biopsy of any suspicious lesions found. However, {{the processing of}} biopsy material and {{the interpretation of the}} results inevitably leads to diagnostic delay and the added possibility of taking an unrepresentative sample. Therefore, techniques that can distinguish between benign from malignant types in a reliable and noninvasive way would be very useful.

40|$|ObjectivesSepsis-associated {{encephalopathy}} (SAE) is {{the most}} widespread metabolic encephalopathy, which continues to be clinically evaluated with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). This study aimed to determine the clinical utility of serum tau protein as an effective and easily attainable biochemical marker {{of morbidity and mortality}} for patients with SAE. MethodsThis prospective cohort study included 70 patients admitted to the emergency department with sepsis or septic shock, who were then diagnosed with SAE based on the GCS between February 2, 2009 and July 30, 2009. Statistical analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between serum tau levels, the development of SAE and subsequent patient morbidity and mortality. ResultsOut {{of the total number of}} patients enrolled in the study, 50 % received the diagnosis of SAE based on GCS upon admission. Of the patients admitted to the hospital for further observation, 2. 9 % developed SAE over the course of several days using GCS criteria. Even though tau levels were higher in patients with SAE, there was no statistically significant difference with tau levels in patients that did not develop SAE. In addition, there were no significant correlations between tau levels, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and patient mortality. ConclusionsSerum tau levels do not reflect brain damage and encephalopathy for SAE patients. Moreover, this protein does not correlate with patient morbidity and mortality and the SOFA score. Thus, serum tau protein cannot be utilized as a reliable biochemical marker of SAE. Further research is needed to identify effective <b>and</b> <b>easily-obtainable</b> biomarkers to supplement the GCS in SAE diagnosis...|$|R

Evaluation of muscle fatigue is required not only for muscle suit but also for rehabilitation, muscle training and human physical support, estimation of muscle fatigue is required. In order to prevent the economic losses such as the compensation of the work-related injuries, the fatigue evaluation for workers is also desired. Although the frequency transition of electromyogram (EMG) method is generally used for fatigue assessment, it has certain drawbacks depending on conditions and environment. For instances, it is impossible to apply in the case of isotonic contraction. Thus, there are no apparatus or methods which measure muscle fatigue <b>noninvasively</b> <b>and</b> simply [10].|$|R
