5|$|SvalSat {{is owned}} and {{operated}} by Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT), which is again equally owned by Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace and the Norwegian Space Centre, the latter which is again owned by the Ministry of Trade and Industry. KSAT is <b>not</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> a particular operator of satellites and the antennas communicate with multiple satellites, thus reducing costs compared to dedicated ground stations. For a typical satellite, data is delivered to the end customer no more than thirty minutes after downloading.|$|E

5|$|The Pacific swift has a {{very large}} range, {{exceeding}} 10,000,000km2 (3,800,000mi2). Its population is unknown, although it is common throughout its breeding range with {{no evidence of any}} decline. It is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. There appear to be no significant threats to this bird; predation is low, and this swift is <b>not</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> a particular habitat. Some birds may die through misadventure or become exhausted when lost on migration (the first record for the Western Palaearctic was found resting on a North Sea gas platform), but swifts have high survival rates and are generally long-lived. The common swift, a close relative of the Pacific swift, has been recorded as reaching 21years old.|$|E

5|$|WWV {{had been}} {{broadcasting}} second pulses since 1937, but these pulses were <b>not</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> actual time. In June 1944, the United States Naval Observatory allowed WWV {{to use the}} USNO's clock {{as a source for}} its time signals. Over a year later, in October 1945, WWV broadcast Morse code time announcements every five minutes. Voice announcements started on January 1, 1950, and were broadcast every five minutes. Frequencies of 600Hz and 440Hz were broadcast during alternating minutes. By this time, WWV was broadcasting on 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35MHz. The 30 and 35MHz broadcasts were ended in 1953.|$|E
5|$|On December 4, 2011, {{the final}} Bowl Championship Series standings were {{unveiled}} with LSU ranked first, followed by Alabama, {{to set up}} a rematch between the two teams in the 2012 BCS National Championship Game. In the weeks that led up to the game, the notion of a split national championship became a major storyline. This was the case as the AP Poll is <b>not</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> the Bowl Championship Series and some AP voters expressed they might vote LSU national champions even if they lost as they defeated Alabama in their regular season game. However, after Alabama shut out LSU 21–0 in the BCS National Championship Game, the AP voted them national champions to give the Crimson Tide the consensus national championship and thus avoid a split title with LSU.|$|E

25|$|A normal {{platelet}} count {{is considered to}} be in the range of 150,000450,000 per microlitre (μl) of blood for most healthy individuals.

25|$|In 2014, the Federal Administrative Court of Switzerland invalidated a {{governmental}} decision of 2010 which allowed only absinthe {{made in the}} Val-de-Travers region to be labeled as absinthe in Switzerland.

25|$|Because of Nietzsche's evocative {{style and}} provocative ideas, his {{philosophy}} generates passionate reactions. His works remain controversial, due to varying interpretations and misinterpretations of his work.

We explored the facts surrounding Blandon's sentence reductions and found through our interviews of DEA and federal prosecutors that his reductions in sentence were based on his substantial cooperation with prosecutors and investigators, <b>not</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> the Contras or the CIA. We made no attempt independently to measure the value of Blandon's cooperation; instead we sought to determine whether his cooperation {{was the reason for}} his lenient treatment.|$|R

25|$|The Soviet Union was the world's sole {{communist}} {{state with}} very little international trade. Its economy was <b>not</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> {{the rest of the}} world and was only slightly affected by the Great Depression.

25|$|DNA {{sequence}} databases like GenBank contain many sequences {{that are}} <b>not</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> vouchered specimens (for example, herbarium specimens, cultured cell lines, or sometimes images). This is problematic {{in the face}} of taxonomic issues such as whether several species should be split or combined, or whether past identifications were sound.

25|$|Real burdens (onroerende belastingen): Any bonded or unfree feuar (cijnsplichtige) of the manor's {{dependent}} holdings {{was required}} to pay a yearly feu-duty (cijns or cijnsgeld), which {{is comparable to the}} payment of property taxes today. The amount of the cijns was proportional {{to the size of the}} burdened land.

25|$|In 1998, {{silicone}} hydrogels became available.

Because silicone allows more oxygen permeability than water, oxygen permeability of silicone hydrogels is <b>not</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> the lenses' water content. Lenses have now been developed with so much oxygen permeability that they are approved for overnight wear (extended wear). Lenses approved for daily wear are also available in silicone hydrogel materials.|$|E
