5|$|Seeing <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> avoid further bloodshed, the Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman {{decided to}} expel Singapore from the federation. Goh Keng Swee, {{who had become}} skeptical of merger's {{economic}} benefits for Singapore, convinced Lee Kuan Yew that the separation had to take place. UMNO and PAP representatives worked out the terms of separation in extreme secrecy in order to present the British government, in particular, with a fait accompli.|$|E
5|$|The Police Directorate {{sees the}} use of the {{encrypted}} communication as the system's greatest benefit, and has stated that it sees no reason for the implementation to stop while it is being evaluated, and that there is <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> implementing it nationally. The system was first taken into use in Østfold and Follo in December 2009, and by Oslo in March 2010. In Oslo, the police chose to close the analog network down before the TETRA system had been installed in all vehicles, and instead give all officers hand-held devices, to speed up the closing of the old network, which is regarded as a security hazard. Traditionally, journalists have learned about events by listening to the police radios. The police have appointed press officers who will inform the press about newsworthy incidents. The alarm center for the fire departments in Østfold and Follo started using the system in June 2010.|$|E

25|$|On 7 August 1965, Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman, seeing <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> avoid further bloodshed, {{advised the}} Parliament of Malaysia {{that it should}} vote to expel Singapore from Malaysia.

Ostdeutsche Albatros Werke, {{which had been}} engaged in production of the D.III, received orders for 600 D.Va aircraft in October. Deliveries of the D.Va commenced in October 1917. The structural problems of the Fokker Dr.I and the mediocre performance of the Pfalz D.III left the Luftstreitkräfte with <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> the D.Va until the Fokker D.VII entered service in mid-1918.|$|E

25|$|The Second Bank of the United States {{was closed}} during Noble's first term, leaving the state without a bank to hold {{government}} deposits or to supply paper money. There {{had been no}} banks operating in Indiana for a decade, so with <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> the situation the General Assembly passed a bill to create the Bank of Indiana. Noble had not taken {{a position on the}} bill, but signed it into law. The bank eventually turned out to be very profitable {{and one of the most}} important acts of his time in office. Noble also oversaw the creation of plans to build Indiana's third statehouse in 1831. The building was completed in 1835, and he also oversaw the move of the government's offices.|$|E
25|$|There {{were many}} heated ideological {{conflicts}} between the two governments, even on the economic front. Despite an earlier agreement to establish a common market, Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading {{with the rest of}} Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore did not extend to Sabah and Sarawak {{the full extent of the}} loans agreed to for economic development of the two eastern states. The situation escalated to such an intensity that talks soon broke down and abusive speeches and writing became rife on both sides. Because of this, on 7 August 1965,the then Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman, seeing <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> avoid further bloodshed, advised the Parliament of Malaysia that it should vote to expel Singapore from Malaysia. On 9 August 1965, the Malaysian Parliament voted 126 to 0 (with Singaporean delegates not present) to move a bill to amend the constitution providing for Singapore to separate from the Federation of Malaysia.|$|E
25|$|However, many {{argue that}} the British were forced to {{expedite}} the Partition by events on the ground. Once in office, Mountbatten quickly became aware if Britain were to avoid involvement in a civil war, which seemed increasingly likely, there was <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> partition and a hasty exit from India. Law and order had broken down many times before Partition, with much bloodshed on both sides. A massive civil war was looming by the time Mountbatten became Viceroy. After the Second World War, Britain had limited resources, perhaps insufficient {{to the task of}} keeping order. Another viewpoint is that while Mountbatten may have been too hasty he had no real options left and achieved the best he could under difficult circumstances. The historian Lawrence James concurs that in 1947 Mountbatten was left with no option but to cut and run. The alternative seemed to be involvement in a potentially bloody civil war from which {{it would be difficult to}} get out.|$|E

25|$|Churchill was {{appointed}} Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1924 under Stanley Baldwin and oversaw Britain's disastrous {{return to the}} gold standard, which resulted in deflation, unemployment, and the miners' strike {{that led to the}} General Strike of 1926. His decision, announced in the 1924 budget, came after long consultation with treasury officials, various economists, and the board of the Bank of England. Churchill was sceptical about the benefits of returning to the gold standard, and widely questioned the almost unanimous advice he was receiving that it was necessary. The governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman, said that 'there was <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> a return to gold'. The permanent secretary to the treasury, Sir Otto Niemeyer said that not to do so would show Britain had never 'meant business' about the gold standard, and that 'our nerve had failed'. The parliamentary joint select committee on Currency and Banking under its chairman Lord Bradbury (former permanent secretary to the treasury) supported a return, as did the Labour shadow chancellor, Snowden.|$|E

[...] Franck then took the report to Washington, D.C., where the Interim Committee met on June 21 to re-examine its earlier conclusions; but it reaffirmed that there was <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> the use of the bomb on a military target.|$|E

500|$|PEDs, in {{combination}} with price elasticity of supply (PES), {{can be used to}} assess where the incidence (or [...] "burden") of a per-unit tax is falling or to predict where it will fall if the tax is imposed. For example, when demand is perfectly inelastic, by definition consumers have <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> purchasing the good or service if the price increases, so the quantity demanded would remain constant. [...] Hence, suppliers can increase the price by the full amount of the tax, and the consumer would end up paying the entirety. In the opposite case, when demand is perfectly elastic, by definition consumers have an infinite ability to switch to alternatives if the price increases, so they would stop buying the good or service in question completely—quantity demanded would fall to zero. [...] As a result, firms cannot pass on any part of the tax by raising prices, so they would be forced to pay all of it themselves.|$|E
500|$|By-election losses eroded {{and finally}} removed Labour's small {{parliamentary}} majority, and in March 1977 Callaghan {{was in danger}} of losing a confidence vote that would have precipitated a general election. Opinion polls indicated that an election at that time would have been equally disastrous for the Labour and Liberal parties; to ensure mutual survival, a [...] "Lib-Lab pact" [...] was agreed, whereby in return for certain policy concessions the Liberals would support the Government. [...] Thorpe used his influence to insist that legislation for direct elections to the European Parliament was part of the pact, but was unable to secure his principal objective, a commitment to a proportional basis in these elections. [...] In parliament, Thorpe spoke in favour of Scottish and Welsh devolution, arguing that there was <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> home rule except total separation. In the various debates related to the unresolved issue of Rhodesia, Thorpe pressed for the involvement of representatives from the African nationalists, {{in the form of the}} Patriotic Front, in negotiations for a peaceful settlement to the long-running Rhodesian Bush War.|$|E
500|$|The counterattack on {{the police}} station failed but delayed the Syrian attack on the Deganias by twenty-four hours. In the evening of May 19, a {{delegation}} from the Deganias arrived in Tel Aviv to ask for reinforcements and heavy weapons. One of its members later wrote that David Ben-Gurion told them he could not spare them anything, as [...] "The whole country is a front line". He also wrote that Yigael Yadin, the Chief Operations Officer of the Haganah, told him that there was <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> letting the Arabs approach to within twenty to thirty meters of the gates of Degania and fight their tanks in close combat. Yadin prepared reinforcements, and gave an order: [...] "No point should be abandoned. [...] must fight at each site". He and Ben-Gurion argued over where to send the Yishuv's only battery of four pre-World War I 65mm mountain guns (nicknamed [...] "Napoleonchikim"), which had no proper sights. Ben-Gurion wanted {{to send them to}} Jerusalem, but Yadin insisted that they be sent to the Kinarot valley, and Ben-Gurion eventually agreed.|$|E
