40|$|Abstract—An {{inherent}} characteristic of most translinear (TL) filters is <b>instantaneous</b> <b>companding.</b> This brief describes a distortionless syllabic companding TL filter {{based on the}} “analog floating-point technique” [1]. Through {{the addition of a}} compensation current to each of the capacitances in the filter, distortion is eliminated. By applying syllabic companding to a TL filter, the input current can be much larger than the quiescent current, thus increasing the dynamic range.

Standing for Near <b>Instantaneous</b> <b>Companded</b> Audio Multiplex and used for digital stereo TV broadcasts to the public, it used the NICAM digital audio system used since the early 1970s for transmitting the audio carrier signal of a broadcast between two or more regional broadcasters and sometimes to the transmitters, where it was converted back to an analogue FM audio carrier 6 MHz above the video carrier signal.|$|R

40|$|Data {{transmission}} technologies changes rapidly {{these days}} {{due to increased}} requirements in bandwidth and reliability. NICAM standard (which stands for Near <b>Instantaneous</b> <b>Companded</b> Audio Multiplex) {{was designed to be}} a digital audio transmission standard and later it was used by the BBC to convey digital stereo sound for TV. It was obvious that allowing data transmission would be, if not a must, at least a welcome feature and in consequence it was extended to allow raw data or mixed data and sound to be transmitted. NICAM is feasible for terrestrial, cable, microwave links and satellites. This paper introduces some basic notions about NICAM datacasting and presents the results of a project whose aim was to design two PC-cards that allow unidirectional data transmission using the NICAM standard...|$|R

40|$|This chapter covers {{device and}} circuit aspects of {{low-power}} analog CMOS circuit design. The fundamental limits constraining {{the design of}} low-power circuits are first recalled {{with an emphasis on}} the implications of supply voltage reduction. Biasing MOS transistors at very low current provides new features but requires dedicated models valid in all regions of operation including weak, moderate and strong inversion. Low-current biasing also has a strong influence on noise and matching properties. All these issues are discussed, together with the particular aspects related to passive devices and parasitic effects. The design process has to be supported by efficient and accurate circuit simulation. To this end, the EKV compact MOST model for circuit simulation is shortly presented. The use of the basic concepts such as pinch-off voltage, inversion factor and specific current are highlighted thanks to some very simple but fundamental circuits and to an effective use of the model. New design techniques that are appropriate for low-power and/or low-voltage circuits are presented with an emphasis on the analog floating point technique, the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>companding</b> principle, and their application to filters...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} seventh-order 0. 05 ° equiripple linear-phase continuous-time filter employing, {{for the first}} time, <b>instantaneous</b> <b>companding.</b> The filter was {{designed}} and integrated in a mature bipolar process. The amount of boost (up to 13 dB) and group-delay adjustment (+/- 30 %) are digitally programmable. The DC gain is controllable up to 10 dB, and the - 3 dB frequency (fc) is tunable from 5 to 70 MHz. The output swing for 1 % THD is higher than 100 mVpp, with a 1. 5 V supply. The filter consumes very low power (5 [...] 13 mW for fc = 70 MHz), compared to state-of-the-art implementations (e. g. 120 mW for fc = 100 MHz [1]). An approach to estimate the distortion in log-domain filters is also presented. The models used for the bipolar transistors include the C pi and Csub parasitic capacitors, the beta effect, and the parasitic emitter resistances. Simple closed-form expressions describing the effect of each nonideality on distortion are derived and compared to simulations.
