50|$|The {{pantograph}} was, {{in keeping}} with most pantographs at the time, spring operated with an elementary head suspension. It featured <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> at the base and knuckle. The operating rods were cleverly hidden inside the hollow arms making an excellent aesthetically pleasing design.|$|E
50|$|The {{front brake}} caliper was resited {{to the rear}} of the fork leg and the front master {{cylinder}} reservoir shape was changed. A hazard switch was added. <b>Needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> were fitted to the swingarm instead of the earlier plain bushings. Tuning modifications were made to the carbs to improve low speed operation. The manual operation fuel tap was replaced with an automatic diaphragm unit. A rear disc brake replaced the earlier drum.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{concerns}} certain phenomena {{that take place}} in the <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing.</b> The friction that generates the anti-torque of a friction pair is the major factor that influences the needle bearing’s wear. In the needle bearing there occur two predominant types of friction: the rolling friction and the sliding friction, and both are subject to examination. The study presents recordings and analysis of the movements of all needle bearing’s rolling elements. The examination was carried out on a special examination stand that precisely emulates the real conditions of the needle bearing’s work. Carefully prepared examination methods enable recording and analyzing frictions in the bearing, estimating a sphere within which the load is shifted, and calculating the coefficient of friction...|$|R
50|$|The 808 is a {{conventional}} three-cylinder engine that weighs 130 lb in its L95 and L100 aircraft versions. The engine features dual capacitor discharge ignition, liquid cooling, fuel pump, a cast iron cylinder liner, ball, <b>needle</b> and <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> throughout. The aircraft version was offered with an optional gearbox reduction system. Starting is electric starter only.|$|R
50|$|<b>Needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> use {{very long}} and thin cylinders. Often {{the ends of the}} rollers taper to points, and these are used to keep the rollers captive, or they may be {{hemispherical}} and not captive but held by the shaft itself or a similar arrangement. Since the rollers are thin, the outside diameter of the bearing is only slightly larger than the hole in the middle. However, the small-diameter rollers must bend sharply where they contact the races, and thus the bearing fatigues relatively quickly.|$|E
50|$|With roots tracing back to 1963, NTN Bearing Corporation of America of Mount Prospect, Illinois {{produces}} and distributes roller {{and ball}} bearings to the United States industrial, automotive and recreational clientele. Products manufactured {{by the company}} include agricultural and farm implement bearings, angular contact ball bearings, automotive bearings, ball and roller bearing mounted units, cylindrical roller bearings, electrical motor bearings, heavy industrial bearings, machine tool bearings, micro and miniature ball bearings, <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> radial ball bearings, spherical roller bearings, tapered roller bearings and ultra-class bearing units.|$|E
50|$|Some manufacturers, such as Cannondale and Strida, offer a fork with {{a single}} leg. Many of Cannondale's single bladed forks, called Lefty, are {{suspension}} forks, in either conventional or inverted configurations. These forks use linear <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> on octagonal races to transmit the steering torque to the wheel, while conventional two bladed suspension forks use tubular linear plain bearings. Use of a Lefty fork requires a special Lefty hub, which attaches to the fork end {{by means of a}} screw that presses the hub onto the axle that is fixed to the fork.|$|E
5000|$|The SB.1 glider was {{designed}} to be an inexpensive, simple machine, constructed primarily of spruce with reinforced sections using light alloy steel. The all-important wing controls had [...] "elevons" [...] pivoted on long, tapered light-alloy tubes extending from {{the leading edge of the}} tip, just inside the fixed part of the wing (illustrated by photographs in the Short SB.4 Sherpa article). The pivoting mechanism had a double-ball bearing unit on the inboard end with main loads transferred to a <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> at the outboard end of the fixed wing. Anti-balance tabs were fitted along trailing edges along with small pneumatically actuated flaps under the inboard sections. When the elevons were rotated in the same direction they functioned as elevators; when rotated in opposite directions they functioned as ailerons.|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} stage, the {{bearings}} of Structures 1 through 5 were repaired. The heavily polluted <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> were completely replaced. The <b>needle</b> <b>bearings</b> (compact <b>roller</b> <b>bearings)</b> were opened and cleaned and the abrasive contact surfaces were reground. The bearings were then greased and closed again.|$|R
50|$|The 230 is a {{conventional}} single-cylinder engine that weighs only 36 lb in its A20 version. The engine features single capacitor discharge ignition, piston porting, tuned exhaust system, slide venturi-type carburetor, fuel pump, a cast iron cylinder liner, ball, <b>needle</b> and <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> throughout.

5000|$|Founded in 1898 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, as the Star Ball Retainer Company, Star Ball Retainer Company {{merged with}} the Bretz Company in 1910 to form the Bearing Corporation of America. NTN Corporation then {{acquired}} Bearing Corporation of America in 1996, establishing NTN-BCA Corporation in Lititz, Pennsylvania the following year. [...] The company produced ball, mounted and <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> used in clutch releases, engines and heavy industrial equipment in addition to constant velocity joints for aerospace, automobile, forklift and manufacturing customers. The company made an announcement that they had plans to close the plant in 2009.|$|E
5000|$|Established in 2003, NTN Bearing Service Co. {{was formed}} by Higashinihon NTN Service Corporation, who was a wholly owned {{subsidiary}} of NTN Corporation at the time. Kyushu NTN Corporation was absorbed into the wholly owned subsidiary, which also took control of Osaka NTN Pillow Center Corporation in Kansai. The consolidation was part of structural reform plan [...] "NEW Plan 21", {{which is based on}} the philosophy that growth in distributor size will improve the organization's capability to deliver product. The company sells and distributes ball bearings, bearing units, <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> parts feeders and plummer blocks. The company has facilities in Hokkaido, Kyushu, Osaka and Tohoku.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of cars were {{fitted with a}} Borg-Warner 3-speed automatic transmission. The other choice was a derivative of the ancient Triumph TR2 gearbox which had been modified and improved over the years {{for use in the}} TR4/A/IRS/TR5/250/6. The first gear ratio was raised and <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> were used in place of the bronze bushings on the layshaft. Early 4-speed manual transmission models could be ordered with an A-type Laycock overdrive unit and later ones frequently came with a J-type Laycock unit. The overdrive option is highly desirable as the engine RPM drops significantly with this option in 3rd and 4th (top) gears.|$|E
50|$|The 540 is a {{conventional}} twin-cylinder engine that weighs 90 lb in its L70 aircraft version. The engine features dual {{capacitor discharge ignition}} (single in the sport vehicle version), reed valve porting, tuned exhaust system, two slide venturi-type carburetors, liquid cooling, fuel pump, a cast iron cylinder liner, ball, <b>needle</b> and <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> throughout. The aircraft version was offered with an optional gearbox reduction system. Starting is electric starter or recoil starter.|$|R
5000|$|Today, the Triumph Vitesse is much sought-after car by enthusiasts; parts {{supply is}} excellent, and the cars have a {{reputation}} for near [...] "bullet-proof" [...] mechanics. This is not completely warranted. The gearbox of the 2 litre suffered from wear of the output shaft [...] "nose" [...] that mates with the input shaft. It was under engineered from the first and frequently wore through the hardened surface necessitating a rebuild with metal spraying and resurfacing. Nowadays it is possible to buy 'Heavy-duty' mainshafts for the overdrive gearboxes with a bigger 18mm diameter tip and a much stronger <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing.</b> This upgrade is based on the re-designed 4-speed gearbox for later TR7 and Dolomite 1850 models, which are basically the same gearbox. The differentials were never up to the power of even the 2 litre and would not stand regular 0-60 blasts without either crown wheel tooth loss or shearing of half shafts. The idiosyncratic threaded front suspension setup is also an area where incorrect maintenance (grease instead of gear oil or no regular lubrication) leads to dramatic failures.|$|R

50|$|Universal joints let {{the shaft}} keep {{rotating}} while allowing for changes due to suspension movement, such as shaft length and horizontal angle, and shaft angle as the steering turns. Constant-velocity universal joints are normally used to transfer power smoothly between the components. The inner universal {{can be a}} plunge or tripod type joint. The tripod is splined to the intermediate shaft and held by a circlip. A ball, supported on <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> is fitted to each post of the tripod, and these slide in a trunion inside the yoke. This caters for changes in shaft length and horizontal angle. The drive is transferred through the trunion and balls to rotate the shaft.|$|E
50|$|Two trains {{consisted}} of white-painted trucks each coupled together. Each 10 tonne train {{consisted of}} 10 trucks each taking 1 tonne. The locomotive was the modified Boxer 532DX mini-skid {{upon which the}} driver stood, either pushing or pulling the coupled trucks. The trucks had plastic wheels designed either to ride along the cylindrical track or along a flat surface. The wheels had <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings.</b> The Boxer obtained traction by means of its rubber track bearing upon the sleepers, but at the rear it had two wheels riding upon the track, the height {{of which could be}} adjusted hydraulically. They could also be raised to free the Boxer from the track whilst it was negotiating points.|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} {{variants of}} an original parallel kinematics machine-tool structure are explored in this article. A new Hooke's universal joint design based on <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> {{with the ability}} of a preload setting is proposed. The bearing stiffness modeling is carried out using a variety of methods. The elastic deformation modeling of a Hook’s joint and a spherical rolling joint have been developed to assess the possibility of using these joints in machine tools with parallel kinematics...|$|E
5000|$|Brinelling can {{be caused}} by a heavy load resting on a {{stationary}} bearing for an extended length of time. The result is a permanent dent or [...] "brinell mark". The brinell marks will often appear in evenly spaced patterns along the bearing races, resembling the primary elements of the bearing, such as rows of indented lines for <b>needle</b> or <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> or rounded indentations in ball bearings. It is a common cause of <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> failures, and loss of preload in bolted joints when a hardened washer is not used. For example, brinelling occurs in casters when the ball bearings within the swivel head produce grooves in the hard cap, thus degrading performance by increasing the required swivel force.|$|R
50|$|The Trabant 601 was {{a modern}} {{automobile}} when introduced in 1963, with 150 Pre-Production examples. The body was modified {{from the previous}} P50/P60 variants of the Trabant, with a heavy emphasis {{on the front and}} roof area. The back of the car was also modified with different taillights and a higher trunk loading height as compared to previous models. Overall the design was praised, particularly on the then modern double trapezoid design. Originally production was planned to run from 1967 to 1971, but in practice continued until 1990.The original engine was only 17 kW (23 hp), but in 1969 a new version was offered with a 19.1 kW (26 hp) engine. In 1974 a <b>Needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> was added to the connecting rod, allowing for a 50/1 lubricant to be used. Through the addition of a 2-stage carburetor in 1984, the fuel consumption was brought down by 1/100 l/km. With these additions, the top speed measured was measured to be 107 km/h. Even with these improvements the fuel consumption could still rise rapidly with extended acceleration or when towing a trailer. The P601 also had an overrunning clutch when running in 4th gear.|$|R

40|$|A fully {{articulated}} four-point bend loading fixture for Modulus of Rupture (MOR) and {{fracture toughness}} specimens utilizes an upper loading plate {{in combination with}} a lower loading plate. The lower plate has a pair of spring loaded ball bearings which seat in V-shaped grooves located in the upper plate. The ball bearings are carried {{in the arms of}} the lower plate. A load is applied to the specimen through steel rollers, one large roller and one smaller roller each located on both the upper and lower plates.

40|$|A {{needle roller}} bearing is a bearing which uses small {{cylindrical}} rollers. Bearings are used to reduce friction of any rotating surface. Needle bearings have a large surface {{in contact with the}} bearing outer surfaces as compared to ball bearings. There is less added clearance(Diameter of the shaft and the diameter of the bearing are different) so they are much compact. The structure consists of a needle cage which contains the needle rollersthemselves and an outer race (The housing itself). Radial bearings are cylindrical and they use rollers parallel to the axis of the shaft. Radial pattern of needle are being used by thrust needles. Complement bearings have solid inner as well as outer rings and rib-guided cylindrical rollers. The bearings have the largest number of rolling elements and also have extremely high radial load carrying capacity and are suitable for compact designs. <b>Needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> have relatively small diameter cylindrical rolling elements whose length is much larger than their diameter. As compared to other types of rolling bearings, <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> possess a small cross-sectional height and significant load-bearing capacity and rigidity relative to their volume. Also, because the inertial force acting on them is limited, needle bearings are an ideal choice for applications with oscillating motion. These bearings also work well in compact and lightweight machine designs and they serve as a ready replacement for sliding bearings. Needle bearings features are great rigidity, smaller cross-section, higher loadcarrying capacity, and has lower inertia forces that facilitate to size and weight reductions in machinery. Needle bearings are designed to stand in oscillation, performwell under any conditions, and interchange with the sliding of bearings...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This articlepresents ahigh-acceleration rotarybondhead {{to improve}} theefficiencyand {{precision}} of thermosonic bonding.

They can reduce the efficiency of the ultrasonic energy transmission and even result in the bonder working abnormally. To avoid these vibration modes, high-frequency harmonic components of the driving signals were eliminated by adding a notch filter to the control system.

50|$|All <b>bearings</b> {{were either}} <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> or <b>needle</b> <b>rollers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> use conical <b>rollers</b> {{that run}} on conical races. Most <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> only take radial or axial loads, but tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> support both radial and axial loads, and {{generally}} can carry higher loads than ball bearings due to greater contact area. Tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are used, for example, as the wheel bearings of most wheeled land vehicles. The downsides to this bearing is that due to manufacturing complexities, tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are usually more expensive than ball bearings; and additionally under heavy loads the tapered roller is like a wedge and bearing loads tend to try to eject the roller; the force from the collar which keeps the <b>roller</b> in the <b>bearing</b> adds to bearing friction compared to ball bearings.|$|R
