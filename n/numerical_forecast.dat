40|$|The use {{of dense}} {{networks}} of rain gauges {{to verify the}} skill of quantitative <b>numerical</b> precipitation <b>forecasts</b> requires bridging the scale gap between the finite resolution of the forecast fields and the point measurements provided by each gauge. This is usually achieved either by interpolating the <b>numerical</b> <b>forecasts</b> to the rain gauge positions, or by upscaling the rain gauge measurements by averaging techniques. Both approaches are affected by uncertainties and sampling errors due to the limited density of most rain gauge networks and to the high spatiotemporal variability of precipitation. For this reason, {{an estimate of the}} sampling errors is crucial for obtaining a meaningful comparison. This work presents the application of a stochastic rainfall downscaling technique that allows a quantitative comparison between <b>numerical</b> <b>forecasts</b> and rain gauge measurements, in both downscaling and upscaling approaches, and allows a quanti- tative assessment of the significance {{of the results of the}} verification procedure...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of various {{combinations}} of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes and the microphysics schemes on the <b>numerical</b> <b>forecasting</b> of tropical cyclones (TCs). Using different combinations of three PBL schemes (YSU, MYJ and MYNN 2) and four microphysics schemes (Ferrier, Goddard, WSM 6 and Lin), a number of experiments are carried out for five landed TCs in the South China Sea during 2012. Results show {{that the combination of}} the YSU and Ferrier schemes performs the best for the TC track forecasting, although it does not perform the best for the forecast of precipitation. Further analysis reveals that the best performance of the track forecast by the combination of the YSU and Ferrier schemes mainly attributes to a more accurate steering flow as well as TC wind structure produced by this combination. These results provide a valuable reference to the operational <b>numerical</b> <b>forecasting</b> of TC tracks in the future...|$|R

40|$|GPS {{data from}} Shanghai GPS Comprehensive and Application Network(SGCAN) {{in the summer}} of 2002 are analyzed. The Ultra-rapid orbit of IGS(IGU) is used {{directly}} in real-time processing. Reliable Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) series can be obtained with the assistant of remote stations. Considering the effect of ocean tide, the accuracy of PWV can be improved. The difference between GPS/PVFV and Radiosonde observations is about 2 mm. Comparison between the outputs of MM 5 and GPS/PWV shows that GPS can be regarded as one means to real-time check up the result of MM 5 numerical prediction. Continuous GPS/PWV series in the whole Meiyu season reflects the changing processes of PWV in detail before and after the onset of the Meiyu Season in the Yangtz River Delta in 2002 summer. The variations of GPS/PWV show that the onset of the Meiyu season was from southwest to northeast and completed in about 7 similar to 8 hours. The rainband moved back and forth among the Yangtz River Delta, Huaihe area and the south to the Yangtz river area in the Meiyu season. The statistics of PWV peaks and one-hour rain explain some short-term forecast ability of GPS/PWV for rainstorms. The humidity condition of <b>numerical</b> <b>forecast</b> model is optimized after GPS/PWV being interpolated to the grids of the initial field using the Cressman method.

40|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} to evaluate fixed-event forecast revisions in macroeconomics by regressing current forecast revisions on one-period lagged forecast revisions. Under weak-form (forecast) efficiency, {{the correlation between}} the current and one-period lagged revisions should be zero. The empirical findings in the literature suggest that this null hypothesis of zero correlation is rejected frequently, and the correlation can be either positive (which is widely interpreted in the literature as “smoothing”) or negative (which is widely interpreted as “over-reacting”). We propose a methodology for interpreting such non-zero correlations in a straightforward and clear manner. Our approach {{is based on the assumption}} that <b>numerical</b> <b>forecasts</b> can be decomposed into both an econometric model and random expert intuition. We show that the interpretation of the sign of {{the correlation between the}} current and one-period lagged revisions depends on the process governing intuition, and the current and lagged correlations between intuition and news (or shocks to the <b>numerical</b> <b>forecasts).</b> It follows that the estimated non-zero correlation cannot be given a direct interpretation in terms of either smoothing or over-reaction...|$|R
