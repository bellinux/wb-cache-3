50|$|The Robeez baby shoe {{company was}} started by Sandra Wilson in the {{basement}} of her Vancouver, Canada home. While being a stay-at-home-mom after a recent layoff, Wilson was unable to find baby shoes that would stay on her son’s feet properly, she came up with an idea for a pair of soft-soled leather booties that would not slip off. The suede <b>non-slip</b> <b>sole</b> allowed her toddler, named Robert, to walk without sliding and the elastic ankle band ensured the shoes didn't easily fall off. The inspiration for the Robeez name came from her son. Now owned and produced by McCubbin Hosiery, LLC, a 60-year industry veteran, Robeez sets the trends for children's footwear, socks and apparel as we create products that parents and babies love.|$|E

This uniform {{consisted}} of a long-sleeved shirt and long pants made of a slightly tougher polyester, and does away with almost all metal parts via the use of Velcro and plastic buttons. They don a blue beret, but are permitted to wear a baseball cap while on operational duties. Footwear {{is in the form}} of lace-up leather shoes with <b>non-slip</b> <b>soles.</b> Unlike the Combat Uniform worn by other units in the police force, the uniform adopted hidden plastic buttons to avoid entanglements, and does away with garters since shoes, and not boots, are worn to allow rapid removal should water entry be required.|$|R
