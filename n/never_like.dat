[...] the actual finale of the Enterprise storyline. Berman said [...] "I've read a lot of the criticisms and I understand how some people feel, but [...] and I {{spent a lot of time}} coming up with the idea and a somewhat, I would say, unique ending to a series, especially when you’re ending it prematurely. [...] You <b>never</b> <b>like</b> to disappoint people, but I think it's nonsense to say that it was more a Next Generation episode than an Enterprise episode. The only elements of [...] that were present were there as a sounding board to allow us to look at a mission that took place six years after [...] "Terra Prime"." ...|$|E
500|$|The Daily Telegraphs Gavin Fuller praised Pullman's {{portrayal}} of Danes, singling {{it out as}} the strongest of the series next to lead female actor Eve Myles. Fuller also felt that giving such an unlikeable character a prominent focus and allowing him a shot at redemption in the final episode [...] "was certainly a brave move from Davies." [...] In a post-series review of what worked and what did not during Torchwood's fourth series, Digital Spys Morgan Jeffrey stated that [...] "Bill Pullman {{made the most of}} his tenure as Oswald Danes, being both extremely charismatic and utterly repellent throughout." [...] Jeffrey stated that [...] "we <b>never</b> <b>like</b> Oswald, but Pullman's layered performance ensures that we do often sympathise with him, before having the rug pulled swiftly out from under us as he commits yet another heinous crime." [...] For his performance as Danes, Pullman received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor In Television.|$|E
500|$|Daft Punk {{have said}} that they donned their robot outfits to easily merge the {{characteristics}} of humans and machines. However, Bangalter later stated that the costumes were initially the result of shyness. [...] "But then it became exciting from the audience's point of view. It's the idea of being an average guy with some kind of superpower." [...] When asked whether the duo expressed themselves differently within the robotic suits, Bangalter stated [...] "No, we don't need to. It's not about having inhibitions. It's more like an advanced version of glam, where it's definitely not you." [...] With the release of Human After All, the musical duo's outfits became slightly less complicated by consisting of black leather jacket and pants and simplified versions of the Discovery headgear. The attire was designed by Hedi Slimane. Bangalter stated that, [...] "We <b>never</b> <b>like</b> {{to do the same thing}} twice. It's more fun and entertaining for us to do something different, whether it's wearing masks or developing a persona that merges fiction and reality. We're happy to give back to the masses".|$|E

500|$|Two critics from Pitchfork Media {{reviewed}} [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] {{separately from}} Night Time, My Time. Jenn Pelly ranked the track as the twelfth-best song released in 2013. She spoke favorably of its lyrical content, commending the chorus lyrics [...] "How could {{you know what}} it feels like to fight the hounds of hell?" [...] and [...] "You think you know me so well" [...] for painting Ferreira as an exemplar for [...] "bullied high school weirdos", and appreciating that the lines [...] "I know it's not your fault / That you don't understand / I blame myself" [...] for acknowledging her own wrongdoings with the intention of starting anew. Jillian Mapes complimented the [...] "bluntness" [...] that was delivered throughout the song, and suggested that the track had [...] "anthem potential". She praised the verses for verbalizing self-confidence issues that are often associated with young women, with particular acclaim being placed on the lines [...] "I’m just a face without a choice / Trust you’d <b>never</b> <b>like</b> to guess what I think above the shoulders." [...] She concluded her review by noting that the song should be recognized as a [...] "declaration of force [...] a song about the power of vulnerability" [...] rather than confusing it for an [...] "admission of weakness".|$|E
500|$|PewDiePie {{originally}} registered a YouTube account {{under the}} name [...] "Pewdie"; he explains that [...] "pew" [...] represents the sound of lasers and [...] "die" [...] means death. After forgetting the password to this account, he then registered the [...] "PewDiePie" [...] YouTube channel on 29 April 2010. After {{he dropped out of}} Chalmers, his parents refused to support him, and as a result he funded his early videos by selling prints of his Photoshop art, as well as working at a hot dog stand. On having to work at the stand, PewDiePie stated, [...] "the fact that I could make videos was so much more important to me than [...] I had to spend a few hours a day doing a job that wasn’t that prestigious." [...] Five years later, PewDiePie recalled, [...] "I knew people were big at other types of videos, but there was no one big in gaming, and I didn’t know you could make money out of it. It was <b>never</b> <b>like</b> a career that I could just quit college to pursue. It was just something I loved to do. And here we are five years later and it’s exploded." [...] By December 2011, PewDiePie's channel had around 60,000 subscribers. Around the time his channel earned 700,000 subscribers, PewDiePie spoke at Nonick Conference 2012. On 11 July 2012, the channel reached 1 million subscribers, and it reached 2 million subscribers in September. In October, OpenSlate ranked the PewDiePie channel as the #1 YouTube channel. That December, PewDiePie signed with Maker Studios.|$|E

Female impersonation had begun during their stage show, because they found themselves writing female characters but had no female member to play them.

2500|$|In November 2013, Schoolboy Q {{expressed}} he {{felt there}} were no more gangsta rappers. In an interview, Schoolboy Q discussed his status as a gangsta rapper: [...] "I'm not one of them rappers that's scared to put a title on their name," [...] Schoolboy Q said during an interview with MTV." [...] Conscious rappers <b>never</b> <b>like</b> to be called conscious rappers and a lyrical rapper <b>never</b> <b>like</b> to be a party rapper. I'm a gangsta rapper, that's who I am. I happen to make fun records at the same time, that's what I do. I joke, I bag on niggas, my personality is like that, but I am a gangsta rapper and that's what I'm gonna bring to the table." [...] During the interview, Schoolboy Q then added that gangsta rappers are nowhere to be found today: [...] "There's no more gangsta rappers. It's just trap music now. So I wanna get that old feeling back that I do naturally. I'm not necessarily trying to bring gangsta rap back. I'm just trying to let you know it's still here and I'm a part of it. I feel like I'm the only one out of the coast that's doing this gangsta rap shit the way that it used to be done...how niggas used to put detail in their music, not just going to the club and turning up." [...] Schoolboy Q said {{that he is going to}} bring that style in Oxymoron: [...] "I'm just telling my story and what I grew up around and what I seen and what I did and I wanna put that in the light instead of everybody just smiling. Like Eminem said, 'Whatever happened to wildin' out and being violent? / Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned passionate ass-whoopin' and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken?' [...] "I'm one of them niggas," [...] Schoolboy Q continued. [...] "Whatever happened to that? I don't want niggas to get beat up or no shit like that, but at the end of the day, that is a part of life and I like that type of music. That's what pushed West Coast music to where it was at like when Dre, Snoop and all them...Dogg Pound. That's what they was doin' and that's what they was talking about and that's what I was raised off of." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peter May won the toss for {{the third}} time in a row and again decided to bat {{regardless}} of the ill-omens as the wicket looked easy going and was expected to take spin. Stonewaller Trevor Bailey who had been promoted in the batting order from 6 to 3, then 2 and was now asked to go in first with Arthur Milton. They were both out for 8 to Ian Meckiff and Alan Davidson and England were 23/2. Once again the England opening partnership had failed and Bailey, a considerable stumbling block for the bowlers down the order had been sacrificed at the top of the order. Tom Graveney (33) and Peter May (42) restored the innings as the fast bowlers found little swing, but Benaud kept them on for over an hour and May edged a ball past Neil Harvey at slip. With the shine taken off the new ball the pacemen were taken off and the spinners brought on, Richie Benaud getting turn almost at once and appealed for leg before wicket against May, but it was turned down. Keith Slater's first Test wicket was May after he had been hit for 4 and 2 and the captain looked in fine form, Slater getting the ball to hang back and it was hit where Benaud had placed Ken Mackay in the covers a few balls before, where he took a fine catch. Graveney edged Benaud just past Harvey which he managed to take for another stunning catch and Dexter was l.b.w. offering no stroke to Slater (2/40) and England were 98/5. The debutant Roy Swetman joined Colin Cowdrey to a great ovation from the 50,000 in the stands and survived a difficult catch to Harvey and another to Colin McDonald who had replaced [...] "The Claw" [...] at leg-slip, both chances off Benaud. The young wicket-keeper used his feet to go down the wicket, so when he padded up he could not given l.b.w., and began to make some runs with Cowdrey stroking the ball through the covers. After tea the vice-captain (34) gave Harvey another catch off Benaud, but Swetman and Tony Lock saw England safely to stumps with 190/6. The next day's start was delayed to past tea because of rain, made worse by the inadequate covering of the infield. When they finally resumed Benaud was spinning the ball more than ever and declined to take the new ball. Lock was out l.b.w. to Mackay, who ended Swetman's fine innings of 41 with another great catch off Benaud. Harvey also accounted for Jim Laker when he knocked the ball up into the air on the first attempt and ran five yards to catch it. Seeing the end was near Fred Trueman scattered the close fielders with a few powerful strokes and heaved the ball into the stands, but he was caught by Burke off Benaud to give the Australian captain 5/83 and England were out for 219. The first day was watched by John Mills and Trevor Howard, who were acting in Australia at the time. Howard compared the England collapse to the final act of the play he was in, saying [...] "Hamlet was <b>never</b> <b>like</b> this".|$|E
