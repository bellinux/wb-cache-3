40|$|Objective 					Disinfection {{procedures}} often cause {{deterioration in}} a maxillofacial prosthesis. Color and hardness alterations {{could lead to}} a replacement of the prosthesis. 		 				Material and Methods 					An experimental chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) and a commercial polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) sample were treated with four different disinfection procedures for a period which simulates 1 year of clinical service. The applied disinfection procedures included microwave exposure and immersion in three solutions, sodium hypochlorite, <b>neutral</b> <b>soap</b> and a commercial disinfecting soap. Shore A hardness (&# 8710;H) and color differences (&# 8710;E) were determined before and after each procedure. All data were analyzed by Two Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's post hoc tests at a level of &# 945;= 0. 05. 				Results 					The samples presented significant alterations in color and hardness after the different disinfection treatments. The color differences (&# 8710;E) were at least eye detectable in all cases and clinically unacceptable in most of the cases, with values ranging from 1. 51 to 4. 15 and from 1. 54 to 5. 92 for the PDMS and CPE material, respectively. Hardness was decreased after all the disinfection procedures in the PDMS, while for the CPE, a decrement was observed after disinfection with sodium hypochlorite and <b>neutral</b> <b>soap</b> and an increment after microwave exposure and the disinfection with a commercial antimicrobial agent. The PDMS samples presented greater alterations in color and hardness after disinfection with sodium hypochlorite solution, while the microwave exposure caused negligible effects. The CPE samples were affected most after disinfection when treated with <b>neutral</b> <b>soap,</b> and more slightly when disinfected with sodium hypochlorite solution. 		 		 					Conclusions 					The disinfection procedures caused alterations in color and hardness of the examined materials. The most suitable disinfection procedure for the PDMS material is microwave exposure, while disinfection with sodium hypochlorite solution is not recommended. The CPE material is suggested to be disinfected with sodium hypochlorite solution and the use of <b>neutral</b> <b>soap</b> is not recommended. Comparing the two materials, the PDMS material is most color stable, while the CPE material presented fewer changes in hardness...|$|E

40|$|A {{molecular}} complex is formed between long-chain carboxylic acids and their alkali salts in a 1 : 1 mixture. These so-called 2 ̆ 01 cacid soaps 2 ̆ 01 d or carboxylate ionomers have multilamellar bilayer-type structures in solid state, which are {{retained in the}} presence of excess water, resembling the dispersions (gels) formed by typical two-chain amphiphiles, e. g. lipids. The special arrangement of hydrogen-bonded pairs of carboxylic acid and carboxylate groups into a unique 2 ̆ 01 chead-group 2 ̆ 01 d is supported by frequency shifts and partial or total disappearance of the characteristic vibrations of carboxylic acid dimers and of carboxylate groups. The existence of well-ordered hydrocarbon chains is demonstrated by the existence and polarization properties of the methylene rocking and wagging propagation modes.

40|$|Purpose: we {{compared}} {{the effectiveness of a}} 3 -in- 1 perineal care washcloth versus standard of care (water and pH <b>neutral</b> <b>soap)</b> to prevent and treat incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD). The product under study was a soft, premoistened washcloth, including a 3 % dimethicone formula, with cleansing, moisturizing, and barrier protection properties. Design: randomized, controlled clinical trial. Subjects and setting: the study sample comprised a random sample of 11 nursing home wards (6 experimental and 5 control) in a convenience sample of 4 nursing homes in Belgium. The sample included nursing home residents at risk for and/or affected by IAD defined as incontinent of urine, feces, urine/feces, and/or having erythema of the perineal skin (not caused by pressure/shear), and/or having an edematous skin in the genital area. Methods: participants in the experimental group were treated according to a standardized protocol, including the use of a 3 -in- 1 perineal care washcloth impregnated with a 3 % dimethicone skin protectant. Participants in the control group received perineal skin care with water and pH <b>neutral</b> <b>soap,</b> the standard of care in Belgian nursing homes. The study period was 120 days. Data were collected between February and May 2010. Incontinence-associated dermatitis prevalence and severity were assessed using the IAD Skin Condition Assessment Tool. The surface (cm 2), redness, and depth of the perineal lesion were assessed daily by the nurses. This tool generates a cumulative severity score (maximum score = 10) based on area of skin affected, degree of redness, and depth of erosion. Results: four hundred sixty-four nursing home residents were assessed and 32. 9 % (n = 141) met the criteria for inclusion, including 73 subjects in the experimental group and 68 in the control group. Baseline IAD prevalence was comparable in both groups (experimental: 22. 3 % vs control: 22. 8 %, P =. 76). Baseline IAD severity was 6. 9 / 10 in the experimental group and 7. 3 / 10 in the control group. A significant intervention effect on IAD prevalence was found (experimental: 8. 1 % vs control: 27. 1 %, F = 3. 1, P =. 003). A nonsignificant effect on IAD severity could be determined (experimental: 3. 8 / 10 vs control: 6. 9 / 10, F = 0. 8, P =. 06). Conclusion: the use of a 3 -in- 1 washcloth, impregnated with a 3 % dimethicone formula, resulted in a significantly reduced prevalence of IAD and a trend toward less severe lesions. These findings provide indicative evidence for the use of 3 -in- 1 perineal care washcloth as an effective intervention against the use of water and a pH <b>neutral</b> <b>soap</b> to prevent and/or treat IA...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was histopathological evaluation of the effect of sodium sulfonate application as <b>neutral</b> <b>soap</b> on the cat's dental pulp after an ideal composite restorative treatment.   Methods: Ten adult cats with 40 caries-free canine teeth were selected for the study. Class V cavities were prepared in the buccal surfaces of all the teeth. The teeth of the right quadrants were treated with composite, whereas the teeth of the left quadrants were primarily etched, after using of sodium sulfonate solution, they treated with composite. The first five cats were killed after one week and the other five cats after one month. The teeth were fixed, decalcified and after being sliced, paraffined blocks were made and microscopic slides were prepared and histologically evaluated. Results: The results of the histological evaluation showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the intensity of inflammation in the pulp of the teeth in the right and left quadrants after one week (P= 1. 000) and one month (P= 0. 773). However, there was significant difference after one week regarding predentin formation (P= 0. 017) and in the teeth of the left quadrants, the formation of predentin was more that the right quadrants, but no meaningful difference was observed after one month (P= 0. 203).    Conclusion: It seems that the sodium sulfonate in composite restorative treatments without fear of damage to the pulp can be used...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of the regular use of a hand cream after washing hands on skin hydration and skin roughness. Methods Twenty-five subjects washed hands and forearms with a <b>neutral</b> <b>soap</b> four times per day, for 2 minutes each time, for a total of two weeks. One part of them used a hand cream after each hand wash, the others did not (cross over design after a wash out period of two weeks). Skin roughness and skin hydration were determined on the forearms on days 2, 7, 9 and 14. For skin roughness, twelve silicon imprint per subject and time point were taken from the stratum corneum and assessed with a 3 D skin analyzer for depth of the skin relief. For skin hydration, five measurements per subject and time point were taken with a corneometer. Results Washing hands lead to a gradual increase of skin roughness from 100 (baseline) to a maximum of 108. 5 after 9 days. Use of a hand cream after each hand wash entailed a decrease of skin roughness which the lowest means after 2 (94. 5) and 14 days (94. 8). Skin hydration was gradually decreased after washing hands from 79 (baseline) to 65. 5 after 14 days. The hand wash, followed by use of a hand cream, still decreased skin hydration after 2 days (76. 1). Over the next 12 days, however, skin hydration did not change significantly (75. 6 after 14 days). Conclusion Repetitive and frequent hand washing increases skin dryness and roughness. Use of a hand cream immediately after each hand wash can confine both skin dryness and skin roughness. Regular use of skin care preparations should therefore help to prevent both dry and rough skin among healthcare workers in clinical practice. </p...|$|E

The phenol had considerably greater activity in both test methods when emulsified with the <b>neutral</b> <b>soap</b> than when converted to the phenate and dissolved in water. Use dilution test results against Salmonella choleraesuis with both the phenol and the phenate were within the range which would have been predicted from the Salmonella typhosa coefficient results employing the conventional conversion multiple of 20 to determine the maximal number of parts of water to which one part of germicide could be added. With the emulsified phenol this was also true where Staphylococcus aureus was employed in both procedures. With the aqueous solution of the phenate the maximal safe use-dilution by the phenol coefficient found for S. aureus and the same conventional conversion procedure was roughly five times higher than the maximal safe use-dilution found by the use-dilution method. Results with aqueous solutions of the phenate to which increasing amounts of excess NaOH were added showed no significant differences in the phenol coefficient method with either S. typhosa or S. aureus. In the use-dilution method, significant decreases in activity were found as the excess NaOH was increased to 4 % with both S. choleraesuis and S. aureus. Although the pH values of aqueous solutions of the phenate were raised as the amount of free NaOH was increased, the decreases in pH observed as the dilution with water was increased were such that only small differences existed at the high critical killing dilutions found in the low challenge phenol coefficient method, whereas rather large differences existed at the lower critical killing dilutions in the high challenge use-dilution method...|$|E
40|$|There is no {{standard}} {{technique for}} the analysis of dyes on historic textiles. After reviewing all available techniques for analysis of dyes, a technique of identification by thin-layer chromatography was derived {{that could be used in}} a museum laboratory. This technique was used with moderate success on textiles recovered from a 1965 Missouri river boat, the “Bertrand. ” Major problems were not with the technique itself but with the known dyeings—too few were available and some were not detectable after the identifications had been completed. The procedure followed in this technique was: clean the textiles thoroughly in a <b>neutral</b> <b>soap</b> wash then scour in carbon tetrachloride, ethanol and water; dry; extract the dyestuffs from the textile successfully with hydrochloric acid, ethanol, and water; dry; extract the dyestuffs from the textile successfully with hydrochloric acid, ethanol, carbon tetrachloride and glacial acetic acid; concentrate the extractions; spot the extracts onto precoated polyamide sheets with fluorescent indicator; develop in a solvent system of ethanol, water, and formic acid 85 : 10 : 10 (V:V:V) after development, examine the developed chromatographs of the known and unknown dyeings under longwave ultraviolet light; identifications are based on a comparison of Rf values and fluorescence of the developed spots. Revisions suggested for the technique were to obtain a more complete library of known dyeings; combine the hydrochloric acid and the ethanol extracts; employ more than one absorbent and solvent system; and utilize certain sprays as an aid in the detection of the spots after development. The question is raised and briefly examined as to when a dye analysis that identifies the specific dyestuff on a textile would be desirable and when other tests might be more appropriate. The final conclusion was that this technique could be used in a museum laboratory, but the problems of colorant identification might be more satisfactorily solved either by laboratories associated with the commercial dye houses or in a yet-to-be established central laboratory for museum work of this nature.
