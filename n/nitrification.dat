5|$|The {{relative}} abundance of 14N and 15N is practically constant {{in the atmosphere}} but can vary elsewhere, due to natural isotopic fractionation from biological redox reactions and the evaporation of natural ammonia or nitric acid. Biologically mediated reactions (e.g., assimilation, <b>nitrification,</b> and denitrification) strongly control nitrogen dynamics in the soil. These reactions typically result in 15N enrichment of the substrate and depletion of the product.|$|E
5|$|Chemolithotrophy {{is a type}} of {{metabolism}} {{found in}} prokaryotes where energy is obtained from the oxidation of inorganic compounds. These organisms can use hydrogen, reduced sulfur compounds (such as sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and thiosulfate), ferrous iron (FeII) or ammonia as sources of reducing power and they gain energy from the oxidation of these compounds with electron acceptors such as oxygen or nitrite. These microbial processes are important in global biogeochemical cycles such as acetogenesis, <b>nitrification</b> and denitrification and are critical for soil fertility.|$|E
5|$|Lithotrophic {{bacteria}} can use inorganic compounds {{as a source}} of energy. Common inorganic electron donors are hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia (leading to <b>nitrification),</b> ferrous iron and other reduced metal ions, and several reduced sulfur compounds. In unusual circumstances, the gas methane can be used by methanotrophic bacteria as both a source of electrons and a substrate for carbon anabolism. In both aerobic phototrophy and chemolithotrophy, oxygen is used as a terminal electron acceptor, whereas under anaerobic conditions inorganic compounds are used instead. Most lithotrophic organisms are autotrophic, whereas organotrophic organisms are heterotrophic.|$|E
5|$|Significant discoveries {{relating}} to nitrogen assimilation and metabolism, including ammonification, <b>nitrification</b> and nitrogen fixation (the uptake of atmospheric nitrogen by symbiotic soil microorganisms) {{had to wait}} for advances in chemistry and bacteriology in the late 19th century and this was followed in the early 20th century by the elucidation of protein and amino-acid synthesis and their role in plant metabolism. With this knowledge it was then possible to outline the global nitrogen cycle.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{several studies}} have shown that archaea exist not only in {{mesophilic}} and thermophilic environments but are also present, sometimes in high numbers, at low temperatures as well. For example, archaea are common in cold oceanic environments such as polar seas. Even more significant are the large numbers of archaea found throughout the world's oceans in non-extreme habitats among the plankton community (as part of the picoplankton). Although these archaea can be present in extremely high numbers (up to 40% of the microbial biomass), almost none of these species have been isolated and studied in pure culture. Consequently, our understanding of the role of archaea in ocean ecology is rudimentary, so their full influence on global biogeochemical cycles remains largely unexplored. Some marine Crenarchaeota are capable of <b>nitrification,</b> suggesting these organisms may affect the oceanic nitrogen cycle, although these oceanic Crenarchaeota may also use other sources of energy. Vast numbers of archaea are also found in the sediments that cover the sea floor, with these organisms making up the majority of living cells at depths over 1 meter below the ocean bottom. It has been demonstrated that in all oceanic surface sediments (from 1000- to 10,000-m water depth), the impact of viral infection is higher on archaea than on bacteria and virus-induced lysis of archaea accounts for up to one-third of the total microbial biomass killed, resulting in the release of ~0.3 to 0.5 gigatons of carbon per year globally.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, {{two groups}} {{independently}} showed the microbial genus Nitrospira {{is capable of}} complete <b>nitrification</b> (Comammox).|$|E
25|$|Hydroxylamine is an {{inorganic}} compound with the formula NH2OH. The pure material is a white, unstable crystalline, hygroscopic compound. However, hydroxylamine {{is almost always}} provided and used as an aqueous solution. It is used to prepare oximes, an important functional group. It is also an intermediate in biological <b>nitrification.</b> In biological <b>nitrification,</b> the oxidation of NH3 to hydroxylamine is mediated by the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase (AMO). Hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) further oxidizes hydroxylamine to nitrite.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{livestock}} {{is responsible}} for 64 percent of man-made ammonia emissions, which contribute significantly to acid rain. By extension, animal waste contributes to environmental pollution through <b>nitrification</b> and acidification of soil.|$|E
25|$|In some {{wastewater}} treatment plants, {{a small amount}} of methanol is added to wastewater to provide a carbon food source for the denitrifying bacteria, which convert nitrates to nitrogen gas and reduce the <b>nitrification</b> of sensitive aquifers.|$|E
25|$|Nitrogen {{is removed}} through the {{biological}} oxidation of nitrogen from ammonia to nitrate (<b>nitrification),</b> followed by denitrification, {{the reduction of}} nitrate to nitrogen gas. Nitrogen gas is released to the atmosphere and thus removed from the water.|$|E
25|$|Ammonia (NH3) {{is highly}} toxic {{to fish and}} the level of ammonia {{discharged}} from wastewater treatment facilities must be closely monitored. To prevent fish deaths, <b>nitrification</b> via aeration prior to discharge is often desirable. Land application can be an attractive alternative to the aeration.|$|E
25|$|Combined {{biological}} and mechanical aquarium filtration systems are common. These either convert ammonia to nitrate (removing nitrogen {{at the expense}} of aquatic plants), or to sometimes remove phosphate. Filter media can house microbes that mediate <b>nitrification.</b> Filtration systems are sometimes the most complex component of home aquaria.|$|E
25|$|The {{catchment}} {{area of the}} river is industrial and urban, and was the location for 48 sewage treatment works, the discharges from which fed into the river. Of these, eleven were deemed to be unsatisfactory in 1974, and a program of rationalisation and improvement had {{reduced the number of}} works to 29 by 1996. Those closed included all of the unsatisfactory ones. Many of the remaining works are small, but the three major ones are located at Old Whittington, Staveley and Woodhouse Mill. Major upgrading of the Old Whittington sewage treatment works was carried out in the late 1980s and again in 1993, and has included the addition of a <b>nitrification</b> plant to remove ammonia from the effluent. This has resulted in a dramatic increase in water quality since 1993. Staveley works was built in 1993, and also includes a <b>nitrification</b> plant, while Woodhouse Mill works was commissioned in 1979, and replaced a number of poorly-performing smaller works to the south-east of Sheffield.|$|E
25|$|In older {{plants and}} those {{receiving}} variable loadings, trickling filter beds are used where the settled sewage liquor is spread {{onto the surface}} of a bed made up of coke (carbonized coal), limestone chips or specially fabricated plastic media. Such media must have large surface areas to support the biofilms that form. The liquor is typically distributed through perforated spray arms. The distributed liquor trickles through the bed and is collected in drains at the base. These drains also provide a source of air which percolates up through the bed, keeping it aerobic. Biofilms of bacteria, protozoa and fungi form on the media’s surfaces and eat or otherwise reduce the organic content. The filter removes {{a small percentage of the}} suspended organic matter, while the majority of the organic matter supports microorganism reproduction and cell growth from the biological oxidation and <b>nitrification</b> taking place in the filter. With this aerobic oxidation and <b>nitrification,</b> the organic solids are converted into biofilm grazed by insect larvae, snails, and worms which help maintain an optimal thickness. Overloading of beds may increase biofilm thickness leading to anaerobic conditions and possible bioclogging of the filter media and ponding on the surface.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} of ammonium to nitrate is performed primarily by soil-living bacteria and other nitrifying bacteria. In the primary stage of <b>nitrification,</b> the oxidation of ammonium (NH) is performed by bacteria {{such as the}} Nitrosomonas species, which converts ammonia to nitrites (NO). Other bacterial species such as Nitrobacter, {{are responsible for the}} oxidation of the nitrites (NO) into nitrates (NO). It is important for the ammonia (NH) to be converted to nitrates or nitrites because ammonia gas is toxic to plants.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{chloramine}} {{is becoming}} more common as a disinfectant. Although chloramine is not as strong an oxidant, it does provide a longer-lasting residual than free chlorine {{and it will not}} readily form THMs or haloacetic acids. It is possible to convert chlorine to chloramine by adding ammonia to the water after addition of chlorine. The chlorine and ammonia react to form chloramine. Water distribution systems disinfected with chloramines may experience <b>nitrification,</b> as ammonia is a nutrient for bacterial growth, with nitrates being generated as a by-product.|$|E
25|$|Ammonium and nitrite show {{a maximum}} {{concentration}} at 50–80 m (lower {{end of the}} euphotic zone) with decreasing concentration below that depth. This distribution can {{be accounted for by}} the fact that nitrite and ammonium are intermediate species. They are both rapidly produced and consumed through the water column. The amount of ammonium in the ocean is about 3 orders of magnitude less than nitrate. Between ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate, nitrite has the fastest turnover rate. It can be produced during nitrate assimilation, <b>nitrification,</b> and denitrification; however, it is immediately consumed again.|$|E
25|$|Biological Aerated (or Anoxic) Filter (BAF) or Biofilters combine {{filtration}} with biological carbon reduction, <b>nitrification</b> or denitrification. BAF usually {{includes a}} reactor {{filled with a}} filter media. The media is either in suspension or supported by a gravel layer {{at the foot of}} the filter. The dual purpose of this media is to support highly active biomass that is attached to it and to filter suspended solids. Carbon reduction and ammonia conversion occurs in aerobic mode and sometime achieved in a single reactor while nitrate conversion occurs in anoxic mode. BAF is operated either in upflow or downflow configuration depending on design specified by manufacturer.|$|E
25|$|The {{nitrogen}} cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which nitrogen is converted into various chemical forms as it circulates among the atmosphere, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems. The conversion of nitrogen {{can be carried}} out through both biological and physical processes. Important processes in the {{nitrogen cycle}} include fixation, ammonification, <b>nitrification,</b> and denitrification. The majority of Earth's atmosphere (78%) is nitrogen, making it the largest source of nitrogen. However, atmospheric nitrogen has limited availability for biological use, leading to a scarcity of usable nitrogen in many types of ecosystems. The nitrogen cycle is of particular interest to ecologists because nitrogen availability can affect the rate of key ecosystem processes, including primary production and decomposition. Human activities such as fossil fuel combustion, use of artificial nitrogen fertilizers, and release of nitrogen in wastewater have dramatically altered the global nitrogen cycle.|$|E
25|$|Membrane bioreactors (MBR) are {{activated}} sludge systems using a membrane liquid-solid phase separation process. The membrane component uses low pressure microfiltration or ultrafiltration membranes and {{eliminates the need}} for a secondary clarifier or filtration. The membranes are typically immersed in the aeration tank; however, some applications utilize a separate membrane tank. One of the key benefits of an MBR system is that it effectively overcomes the limitations associated with poor settling of sludge in conventional {{activated sludge}} (CAS) processes. The technology permits bioreactor operation with considerably higher mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration than CAS systems, which are limited by sludge settling. The process is typically operated at MLSS in the range of 8,000–12,000mg/L, while CAS are operated in the range of 2,000–3,000mg/L. The elevated biomass concentration in the MBR process allows for very effective removal of both soluble and particulate biodegradable materials at higher loading rates. Thus increased sludge retention times, usually exceeding 15 days, ensure complete <b>nitrification</b> even in extremely cold weather.|$|E
500|$|Light is {{only able}} to {{penetrate}} the top [...] {{so this is the}} only part of the sea where plants can grow. The surface layers are often deficient in biologically-active nitrogen compounds. The marine nitrogen cycle consists of complex microbial transformations which include the fixation of nitrogen, its assimilation, <b>nitrification,</b> anammox, and denitrification. Some of these processes take place in deep water so that where there is an upwelling of cold waters or near estuaries where land-sourced nutrients are present, plant growth is higher. This means that the most productive areas, rich in plankton and therefore also in fish, are mainly coastal.|$|E
2500|$|Natural {{processes}} that generate nitrous oxide may {{be classified as}} <b>nitrification</b> and denitrification. Specifically, they include: ...|$|E
2500|$|... aerobic {{autotrophic}} <b>nitrification,</b> the stepwise oxidation {{of ammonia}} (...) to nitrite (...) and to nitrate (...) (e.g., Kowalchuk and Stephen, 2001), ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Nitrification</b> is {{the process}} by which ammonia (...) is {{converted}} to nitrate (...) [...] [...] <b>Nitrification</b> is actually the net result of two distinct processes: oxidation of ammonia to nitrite (...) by nitrosifying bacteria (e.g. Nitrosomonas) and oxidation of nitrite to nitrate by the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (e.g. Nitrobacter). [...] Both of these processes are extremely energetically poor leading to very slow growth rates for both types of organisms. [...] Biochemically, ammonia oxidation occurs by the stepwise oxidation of ammonia to hydroxylamine (...) by the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase in the cytoplasm, followed by the oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite by the enzyme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase in the periplasm.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{chemicals}} {{are used to}} enhance the efficiency of nitrogen-based fertilizers. [...] In this way farmers can limit the polluting effects of nitrogen run-off. [...] <b>Nitrification</b> inhibitors (also known as nitrogen stabilizers) suppress the conversion of ammonia into nitrate, an anion that is more prone to leaching. [...] 1-Carbamoyl-3-methylpyrazole (CMP), dicyandiamide, and nitrapyrin (2-chloro-6-trichloromethylpyridine) are popular. Urease inhibitors are used to slow the hydrolytic conversion of urea into ammonia, which is prone to evaporation as well as <b>nitrification.</b> [...] The conversion of urea to ammonia catalyzed by enzymes called ureases. [...] A popular inhibitor of ureases is N-(n-butyl)thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Nitrification</b> {{itself is}} a two-step aerobic process, each step {{facilitated}} by {{a different type of}} bacteria. The oxidation of ammonia (NH3) to nitrite (NO2−) is most often facilitated by Nitrosomonas spp. ("nitroso" [...] referring to the formation of a nitroso functional group). Nitrite oxidation to nitrate (NO3−), though traditionally believed to be facilitated by Nitrobacter spp. (nitro referring the formation of a nitro functional group), is now known to be facilitated in the environment almost exclusively by Nitrospira spp.|$|E
2500|$|In 1912, Dr. Gilbert Fowler, a {{scientist}} at the University of Manchester, observed experiments being conducted at the Lawrence Experiment Station at Massachusetts involving the aeration of sewage in a bottle that had been coated with algae. Fowler's engineering colleagues, Ardern and Lockett, experimented on treating sewage in a draw-and-fill reactor, which produced a highly treated effluent. They aerated the waste-water continuously {{for about a month}} and were able to achieve a complete <b>nitrification</b> of the sample material. Believing that the sludge had been activated (in a similar manner to activated carbon) the process was named activated sludge. Not until much later was it realized that what had actually occurred was a means to concentrate biological organisms, decoupling the liquid retention time (ideally, low, for a compact treatment system) from the solids retention time (ideally, fairly high, for an effluent low in BOD5 and ammonia.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Further {{modifications}} to the MLE were to come: [...] Bardenpho and Biodenipho processes include additional anoxic and oxidative processes to further polish the conversion of nitrate ion to molecular nitrogen gas. [...] Use of an anaerobic tank following the initial anoxic process allows for luxury uptake of phosphorus by bacteria, thereby biologically reducing orthophosphate ion in the treated wastewater. [...] Even newer improvements, such as Anammox Process, interrupt the formation of nitrate at the nitrite stage of <b>nitrification,</b> shunting nitrite-rich mixed liquor activated sludge to treatment where nitrite is then converted to molecular nitrogen gas, saving energy, alkalinity, and secondary carbon sourcing. Anammox™ (ANaerobic AMMonia OXidation) works by artificially extending detention time and preserving denitrifiying bacteria {{through the use of}} substrate added to the mixed liquor and continuously recycled from it prior to secondary clarification. Many other proprietary schemes are being deployed, including DEMON™, Sharon-ANAMMOX™, ANITA-Mox™, and DeAmmon™. The bacteria Brocadia anammoxidans can remove ammonium from waste water [...] through anaerobic oxidation of ammonium to hydrazine, a form of rocket fuel.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nitrogen}} cycle {{is an important}} process in the ocean as well. While the overall cycle is similar, there are different players and modes of transfer for nitrogen in the ocean. Nitrogen enters the water through the precipitation, runoff, or as N2 from the atmosphere. Nitrogen cannot be utilized by phytoplankton as N2 so it must undergo nitrogen fixation which is performed predominately by cyanobacteria. Without supplies of fixed nitrogen entering the marine cycle, the fixed nitrogen would be used up in about 2000 years. Phytoplankton need nitrogen in biologically available forms for the initial synthesis of organic matter. [...] Ammonia and urea are released into the water by excretion from plankton. Nitrogen sources are removed from the euphotic zone by the downward movement of the organic matter. This can occur from sinking of phytoplankton, vertical mixing, or sinking of waste of vertical migrators. The sinking results in ammonia being introduced at lower depths below the euphotic zone. Bacteria are able to convert ammonia to nitrite and nitrate but they are inhibited by light so this must occur below the euphotic zone. Ammonification or Mineralization is performed by bacteria to convert organic nitrogen to ammonia. <b>Nitrification</b> can then occur to convert the ammonium to nitrite and nitrate. Nitrate can {{be returned to the}} euphotic zone by vertical mixing and upwelling where it can be taken up by phytoplankton to continue the cycle. N2 can be returned to the atmosphere through denitrification.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nitrogen}} cycle {{refers to the}} conversion of toxic ammonia to nitrite and finally nitrate. While fish waste (urine and feces) and decaying matter release ammonia, the majority of ammonia released (approximately 60%) in both marine and freshwater aquariums is excreted directly into {{the water from the}} fishes' gills. Biological (bacterial) <b>nitrification</b> converts the ammonia into nitrite ions, NO2-, and then to nitrate ions, NO3-. Nitrate is readily taken up and assimilated by algae and hermatypic corals. Some nitrate is converted via an anaerobic bacterial process to free nitrogen, but this process is very difficult to maintain. In the recent past, most nitrate, which is less toxic to fishes and most invertebrates than nitrites, accumulated in the water until it was physically removed by a water change. [...] However, many marine aquarists are now employing the use of a special section of the tank or separate tank altogether, called a [...] "refugium." [...] A refugium is, as its name suggests, a sheltered area that shares water with the primary, or display, tank. [...] Refugiums usually contain a deep sand bed to allow anoxic zones to develop within them where anaerobic bacteria can convert nitrate into nitrogen gas, a useful means of nitrate removal. [...] Various types of macroalgae can be grown and harvested from the refugium as another means of nitrate export. [...] As refugiums become more common in marine aquaria, nitrate levels are easily manageable for even the novice hobbyist. [...] Ammonia and nitrite should be tested regularly; any detectable levels (i.e., over 0 ppm) can be indicative of a problem. Nitrates should not exceed 2 ppm in reef tanks, or 20 ppm in fish-only tanks. It is sometimes acceptable to have a small amount of nitrate buildup, as some livestock, especially fish, are fairly tolerant of nitrate. Most corals, while able to assimilate nitrate, cannot be expected to survive, much less thrive, with high nitrate concentrations.|$|E
60|$|Worms {{prepare the}} ground {82} in an {{excellent}} manner {{for the growth}} of fibrous-rooted plants and for seedlings of all kinds. They periodically expose the mould to the air, and sift it so that no stones larger than the particles which they can swallow are left in it. They mingle the whole intimately together, like a gardener who prepares fine soil for his choicest plants. In this state it is well fitted to retain moisture and to absorb all soluble substances, {{as well as for the}} process of <b>nitrification.</b> The bones of dead animals, the harder parts of insects, the shells of land- molluscs, leaves, twigs, &c., are before long all buried beneath the accumulated castings of worms, and are thus brought in a more or less decayed state within reach of the roots of plants. Worms likewise drag an infinite number of dead leaves and other parts of plants into their burrows, partly for the sake of plugging them up and partly as food.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nitrification</b> is the {{biological}} oxidation of ammonia or ammonium to nitrite {{followed by the}} oxidation of the nitrite to nitrate. The transformation of ammonia to nitrite is usually the rate limiting step of <b>nitrification.</b> <b>Nitrification</b> {{is an important step}} in the nitrogen cycle in soil. <b>Nitrification</b> is an aerobic process performed by small groups of autotrophic bacteria and archaea. This process was discovered by the Russian microbiologist Sergei Winogradsky.|$|E
5000|$|A {{fundamental}} assumption in {{this interpretation}} of the f-ratio is the spatial separation of primary production and <b>nitrification.</b> Indeed, in their original paper, Eppley & Peterson noted that: [...] "To relate new production to export requires that <b>nitrification</b> in the euphotic zone be negligible". [...] However, subsequent observational work {{on the distribution of}} <b>nitrification</b> has found that <b>nitrification</b> can occur at shallower depths, and even within the photic zone.|$|E
50|$|The {{environmental}} concerns of <b>nitrification</b> {{also contribute to}} interest {{in the use of}} <b>nitrification</b> inhibitors: the primary product, nitrate, leaches into groundwater, producing acute toxicity in multiple species of wildlife and contributing to the eutrophication of standing water.
