30|$|Comparisons {{of level}} of {{clinical}} sleep problem between the ASSQ and the SMP were performed using weighted kappa [19 – 21]. Weighted kappa {{was used as}} kappa (unweighted) does not consider the degree of disagreement. Reliability was estimated for the ASSQ scoring system with Cronbach’s alpha. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value [22] were estimated from the ASSQ scoring system sleep problem categories to the SMP categories after the clinical interview. Sensitivity was estimated {{as the number of}} subjects determined by the ASSQ scoring system as <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention from the SMP (moderate and severe) divided by the number of subjects <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention as determined by the SMP. Specificity was estimated by the number of subjects determined by the ASSQ scoring system as not <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical sleep intervention (none, mild categories) divided by the number of subjects not <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention as determined by the SMP. The positive predictive value was estimated by dividing the subjects for which there was agreement on <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention (moderate, severe categories) by the actual number of subjects <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention as determined by the SMP. The negative predictive value was estimated by dividing the subjects for which there was agreement on not <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention by the actual number of subjects not <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention as determined by the SMP.|$|R

For out-of-province first year undergraduate students, a high school average of 95% is required to receive a guaranteed one-year entrance scholarship.

In general, entrance scholarship recipients rank in the top 1–2% of their class.|$|E

Some (like the Arabian oryx, Bali mynah, rhinoceros hornbill, Mexican gray wolf, and white rhinoceros) participate in captive breeding programs, some (such as the African spotted dogs) have retired from such programs and <b>need</b> <b>a</b> home, some have behavioral problems, and some are being rehabilitated {{to return to the}} wild. Animals that are in sanctuary are treated somewhat differently from other animals by the zoo. While normal exhibits balance the needs of the animals with those of visitors (for example, incorporating large viewing areas), the sanctuary exhibits are almost completely focused on the comfort and well-being of the animals.|$|E

The city engineer estimated it would <b>need</b> <b>a</b> subsidy of NOK2 million in 2006, and the politicians, who wanted the airport to run without subsidies, demanded that Vildanden guarantee for the deficit. This was rejected by Vildanden—on the contrary, the company was in dire need for more capital, and issued a private placement for NOK4 million in December 2005. The company had since the start been losing money, and needed extra capital to get through the rough until it could make an operating profit. After the placement, 15% of the company was owned by DAT, while Coast Air sold their shares. In 2005, Vildanden had a revenue of NOK15 million.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} there were two {{suburban}} tramways on the east side, the Ekeberg Line (opened in 1919) and the Østensjø Line (1923). Only the latter would {{be connected to the}} T-bane; the Ekeberg Line would remain a tramway, but three new lines were to be built—the Grorud Line on the north side and the Furuset Line {{on the south side of}} Groruddalen and the Lambertseter Line on the east of Nordstrand. These areas were all chosen as new suburbs for Oslo, and would quickly <b>need</b> <b>a</b> good public transport system; suburban lines would first be built out extending from the existing tramway, and later a final section with tunnel to the central station would be built. The Lambertseter Line was opened in 1957, from Brynseng to Bergkrystallen while the Østensjø Line was extended to Bøler in 1958.|$|E

This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E

5|$|Crusader (AV2767) was an Australian Army amphibious {{operations}} support ship of World War II. She was launched {{shortly before the}} war ended and entered service in late 1945. From 1945 to 1947 she was mainly used to return Australian Army equipment from the islands off New Guinea. She was also loaned to the Australian Shipping Board in early 1947 and transported earth moving equipment and timber between Melbourne and Tasmania. However, the Army did not <b>need</b> <b>a</b> ship with Crusaders capabilities after the war, and she was sold in 1947 to the Queensland Cement and Lime Company which operated her as a coral barge on the Brisbane River until the mid-1980s. The ship was scuttled in 1986 and subsequently became a popular dive wreck.|$|E
