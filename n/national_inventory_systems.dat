40|$|There are {{two aspects}} {{to this report}} - general {{issues related to the}} {{adoption}} of computer-facilitated learning (CFL) resources, and specific issues relating to setting up a useful and usable inventory of CFL resources. The project team began the project with the idea that we could develop a prototype <b>national</b> <b>inventory</b> using 'snapshots' obtained from institutional surveys, case studies and literature work. However, sufficient data about existing CFL resources is simply not yet available. The emphasis in this report evolved into the development of a framework about how a successful <b>national</b> <b>inventory</b> could be set up and maintained. As we outline later, we are recommending a system of distributed databases 'held together' by metadata standards. The report relates to key themes which emerged from the five case studies conducted in this study. These themes are Policy, Culture and Support. We have woven these themes into the report because we have been convinced that Australian university teachers will look for and use existing CFL resources only when these policy, culture and support issues are addressed.

40|$|The United States has {{identified}} national key categories {{based on the}} estimates presented in this report.

In addition, when an entire time series of emission estimates is prepared, a determination of key categories must also account for the influence of the trends of individual categories. Therefore, a trend assessment is conducted to identify source and sink categories for which significant uncertainty in the estimate would have considerable effects on overall emission trends. Finally, a qualitative evaluation of key categories should be performed, in order to capture any key categories that were not identified in either of the quantitative analyses, but can be considered key because of the unique country-specific estimation methods...|$|R

Key category names can differ from those used elsewhere in the inventory report, due to naming conventions necessary to comply with UNFCCC reporting guidelines. Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Non-Energy Use of Fuels Rather than being combusted for energy, fuels consumed for non-energy purposes act as building blocks or reagents in fabricating other materials. These fossil-fuel-derived materials are important from an emissions perspective since they often provide long-term storage of the fuel’s carbon.

Not {{only do they}} cover a large range of biotic and abiotic conditions, but they are spread over 46 countries, each with their own (forest) policies, <b>inventory</b> <b>systems</b> (Tomppo et al. 2010) and national forest resource projection systems (Barreiro et al. 2016; Barreiro et al. 2017). <b>National</b> forest <b>inventory</b> <b>systems</b> (NFIs), if existing at all, differ considerably in design, size thresholds, definitions, estimation methods, census interval, and importantly, in data access policy. A few countries have made their raw measurements available on the web (Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain), a few make them available on request (e.g. Norway, Sweden), but still most results are only available in aggregated tables and reports. Even when the data are accessible, standardisation and harmonisation between NFIs remains difficult (Köhl et al. 2000; McRoberts et al. 2009; Dunger et al. 2012). Data collection efforts like FOREST EUROPE (FOREST EUROPE 2015) and the Global Forest Resource Assessments by FAO (FAO 2015) try to improve the harmonisation, but it remains a challenge (COSTE 43 2011). National forest resource projection systems show an even larger variety in design, methodologies, processes and update cycles (Barreiro et al. 2016; Barreiro et al. 2017), which makes {{it almost impossible to}} compare projections among countries.|$|R

Its primary purpose is to track data availability and the status of geographic information system (GIS) implementation in state and local governments to aid the planning and building of statewide spatial data infrastructures (SSDI). The Random Access Metadata for Online Nationwide Assessment (RAMONA) database is a critical component of the GIS Inventory. RAMONA moves its FGDC-compliant metadata (CSDGM Standard) for each data layer to a web folder and a Catalog Service for the Web (CSW) that can be harvested by Federal programs and others. This provides far greater opportunities for discovery of user information. The GIS Inventory website was originally created in 2006 by NSGIC under award NA04NOS4730011 from the Coastal Services Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce. The Department of Homeland Security has been the principal funding source since 2008 and they supported the development of the Version 5 during 2011/2012 under Order Number HSHQDC-11-P-00177. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have provided additional resources to maintain and improve the GIS Inventory. Some US Federal programs require submission of CSDGM-Compliant Metadata for data created under grants and contracts that they issue. The GIS Inventory provides a very simple interface to create the required Metadata.|$|R

But the most dangerous effect of climate change is the melting of ice caps on the poles due to which sea levels are rising dangerously and life at the poles is threatened. It is also a reality that habitation in several countries, not very much above the sea-level, for example, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Indonesia, which have a threat of huge displacement of human beings and domestic animals due to global warming. The survival of millions of people in developing countries like India is more vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change because of their limited capacity {{in terms of}} human financial and institutional resources. India is the world’s fourth largest economy and fifth largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, accounting for about 5 % of global emissions. India’s emissions increased 65 % between 1990 and 2005 and are projected to grow another 70 % by 2020.

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Geology) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2014. Non-point source (NPS) control {{strategies}} were initiated in California {{in the late}} 1980 ???s {{under the authority of}} the Porter-Cologne Act and eventually for the development of total maximum daily load (TMDL) plans. Most of the NPS TMDLs developed for California???s Central Valley region (CV) were related to pesticides. Efforts to reduce pesticide loads and concentrations began in earnest around 1990. The NPS control strategies either encouraged or mandated the use of management practices (MPs). Although TMDLs were largely developed for pesticides, the resultant MPs would likely have affected the runoff of other potential pollutants (specifically, nutrients). This study evaluates the effectiveness of agricultural NPS control strategies implemented in California???s CV between 1990 and 2013 by comparing surface-water nutrient concentration and load trends between two periods. In general, use of MPs were encouraged during a ???voluntary??? period (1990 to 2004) and mandated during an ???enforcement??? period (2004 to 2013). Nutrient water-quality data were obtained from U. S. Geological Survey <b>National</b> Water <b>Inventory</b> <b>System</b> (NWIS) and the California Environmental Data Exchange Network (CEDEN). Nutrient concentrations, loads, and trends were estimated by using the recently developed Weighted Regressions on Time Discharge and Season (WRTDS) model. Sufficient total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN) and nitrate (NO 3) data were available to compare the voluntary and enforcement periods for seven sites within the lower Sacramento and San Joaquin basins. For six of the seven sites, flow-normalized mean annual concentrations of TP and NO 3 decreased at a faster rate during the enforcement period than during the voluntary period. Concentration changes during similar years and ranges of flow conditions suggest that MPs designed for pesticides, reduced nutrient loads. Results show that enforceable NPS policies, and accelerated MP implementation, limits NPS pollution, and may control runoff of non-targeted constituents such as nutrients. Geolog...|$|R

Studies on forest biomass in China has only been implemented since the late 1970 s when some related articles were published (e.g., Li [1978]), i.e., a century after the earliest study abroad. Due to special historical reasons, China did not participate in the International Biological Program (IBP), initiated by the International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO), during the period of 1964 – 1974 and thus missed the golden development stage of forest biomass research. Reviewing the development of more than 30  years in China, these preliminary studies started with estimating biomass and productivity of major forest types, gradually covering various other forest types in the country and then focused on the assessment of carbon stock of all our forest ecosystems. To monitor forest biomass and carbon storage in our <b>national</b> forest <b>inventory</b> (NFI) <b>system,</b> and to assure coordination between forest biomass and forest volume, compatible biomass models for individual trees of our major species were developed gradually. Monitoring and assessment of forest biomass and carbon storage based on the NFI data were subsequently conducted.|$|R
