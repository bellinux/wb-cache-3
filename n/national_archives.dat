40|$|Effectively {{integrating}} archive {{resources for}} their optimal utilization {{is becoming increasingly}} important. There is, however, a lack of studies on the mechanisms and frameworks for facilitating the integration of archival resources towards their optimal utilization. This paper proposes a knowledge management based framework for facilitating the optimal utilization of <b>national</b> <b>archive</b> resources through their effective integration in China. Such a framework can rearrange the role of knowledge management in collaboration to protect the value of <b>national</b> <b>archive</b> resources as the knowledge asset of a state. It can reengineer knowledge management activities in communication to share the value of <b>national</b> <b>archive</b> resources as the knowledge asset in a society. Furthermore, the framework can reconfigure knowledge management artifacts in connectivity to increase the value of <b>national</b> <b>archive</b> resources as the knowledge asset of the public. The framework takes the advantages of existed mechanisms on the integration of <b>national</b> <b>archive</b> resources to facilitate their optimal utilization. It {{can be used to}} guide the development of a national strategy for the integration of <b>national</b> <b>archive</b> resources to ensure the provision of public-centric knowledge services...|$|R

5|$|Prior to 1953, {{the office}} of the National Herald (Riksheraldiker) was {{responsible}} for preparing municipal arms and the royal arms of Sweden, but today these duties are carried out by the Heraldry Board of the <b>National</b> <b>Archives,</b> including the State Herald (Statsheraldiker). In order to register new municipal arms, a municipality must submit its proposal to both the <b>National</b> <b>Archives</b> Heraldry Board, which consults and renders an opinion, and to the PRV for registration. Once the board has completed its consultation process and provided a warrant of arms, the arms thus warranted may then be registered by the PRV and implemented by the municipality. Apart from municipal arms, heraldic arms registered by counties and by military and other government bodies are also handled by the <b>National</b> <b>Archives</b> Heraldry Board and the PRV.|$|E
