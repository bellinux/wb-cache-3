40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of bilateral hearing aids (HA) in subjects with mild and moderate-to-severe hearing loss. This study was designed as a within-subject feasibility study. Bilateral HA use was assessed using different laboratory tests on speech reception, listening effort, noise tolerance, and localization. All data were evaluated with bilateral and unilateral HA fittings. Forty experienced bilateral HA users were included with hearing impairment ranging from mild to moderate-to-severe. Subjects were stratified into two groups based on the degree of hearing loss. Speech reception in <b>noise,</b> <b>listening</b> effort, and localization tests showed a bilateral benefit for the moderate-to-severely hearing-impaired subjects. A bilateral benefit was also observed for listening effort in the mildly hearing-impaired group. The assessment of listening effort shows promise as a measure of bilateral HA benefit for mild hearing impairment. Localization and speech reception in noise tests provide additional value for larger losses. The next step is to compare experienced unilateral with bilateral HA user...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{different}} kinds of music on information searching in a crowded cafeteria. Our experiment employs four texts that differ in length only, not in content or syntactic complexity. Each text is loaded on a web page and displayed on a PDA. We ask to participants 20 questions about each text and then compare their accuracy and performance time. Participants carry out their task in three different background conditions: normal environmental noise, earphones with classical symphonic music or earphones with modern Italian songs. We assume that classical symphonic music improves information searching by isolating the participant from the noise and background chitchatting of the cafeteria, while modern Italian music compromises performance, because processing the lyrics interferes with the task. In line with our expectations, classical music significantly improves information searching, but contrary to our hypotheses, Italian music improves performance, although not in a significant way. We conclude that in a situation with background <b>noise,</b> <b>listening</b> to classical music increases the speed of information searching with respect to a condition without music...|$|E

For adults with aphasia it may become difficult to understand spoken language, especially in noise, and listening can become difficult. However, it is unclear as to what listening conditions might {{be more or less}} difficult for adults with aphasia. Past work on speech recognition in quiet versus noise, and past work on speech recognition in auditory-only versus auditory-visual conditions has yielded mixed results.

To assess the annoyance generated by such <b>noise,</b> <b>listening</b> tests were performed on binaural recordings made from different brands of inverters in various operating conditions. 42 participants judged how unpleasant each of 40 sound samples appeared when compared to a reference using the method of magnitude estimation. In addition, they performed all possible paired comparisons on {{a subset of the}} sounds. The paired-comparison data were largely consistent with the Bradley-Terry-Luce model implying that auditory unpleasantness of these sounds is ratio-scalable. The magnitude estimates were highly reliable, showed systematic dependencies on the type of solar inverter, and increased monotonically with the electrical power converted. They further indicated that the noise components due to cooling ventilation emerging in the mid-frequency range have a greater impact on perceived unpleasantness than the high-frequency peaks near 16 – 18 kHz. When trying to predict mean unpleasantness scale values on the basis of psychoacoustical metrics, a linear combination of (binaural) loudness, roughness, and sharpness accounted for over 90 % {{of the variance in the}} subjective data. By contrast, A-weighted sound pressure level and other purely acoustical measures performed poorly in this respect.

40|$|Recent {{findings}} {{have shown that}} listening to white noise can improve memory in people with ADHD or low levels of attention. The current study explored whether white noise can improve performance on a test of sustained attention. Participants (N= 19) were divided into an attentive (N= 10) and inattentive group (N= 9) based on the inattention sub-section of the ASRS (Adult Self-Report ADHD Scale). Participants completed four blocks of a Three-Stimulus Oddball task. Participants completed the task under four conditions: in silence, while listening to continuous white <b>noise,</b> <b>listening</b> to a tone and listening to short bursts of white noise. It {{was found that the}} inattentive group performed worse in all four conditions compared to the attentive group by making more errors and having a higher variability in response times. There was no positive effect of listening to white noise or the tone for either group. The results of the study did not lend support towards the hypothesis that inattentive participants benefit from white noise on a test of sustained attention. It was suggested that future research should replicate the current experiment using more participants, more noise manipulations and by increasing motivation through including continuous feedback. It was also suggested that white noise should be tested in conjunction with working memory tasks and test of inhibition and interference handling since impairments in these processes are also implicated in the ADHD symptom profile...|$|E

Combination of cognitive with neurophysiological stimulations has been successfully employed to modulate responses of specific brain regions. The present research combined a neurophysiological pre-conditioning with a cognitive conditioning stimulation to modulate behavior. We applied this new state-dependency approach to investigate the cerebellar role in musical and spatial information processing, given that a link between musical perception and visuo-spatial abilities and a clear cerebellar involvement in music perception and visuo-spatial tasks have been reported. Cathodal, anodal or sham transcranial cerebellar Direct Current Stimulation (tcDCS) pre-conditioning was applied on the left cerebellar hemisphere followed by conditioning stimulation through music or white <b>noise</b> <b>listening</b> in a sample of healthy subjects performing a Line Bisection Task (LBT). The combination of the cathodal stimulation with music listening resulted in a marked attentional shift toward the right hemispace, compensating thus the natural leftward bias of the baseline condition (pseudoneglect). Conversely, the anodal or sham pre-conditioning stimulations combined with either music and white noise conditioning listening did not modulate spatial attention. The efficacy of the combined stimulation (cathodal pre-conditioning and music conditioning) and the absence of any effect of the single stimulations provide a strong support to the state-dependency theory. They propose that tcDCS in combination with music listening could act as a rehabilitative tool to improve cognitive functions in the presence of neglect or other spatial disorders. cerebellum; music listening; pseudoneglect; state dependency; tcDC...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} free, improvised music in London and its practitioners. The {{dissertation}} {{is divided into}} a discussion of different conceptions of the avant-garde with particular reference to critical theory and post-modernism, and transcribed interviews with musicians, making up an oral history of free music. It includes material on {{the historical development of}} the avant-garde and the histories of jazz and contemporary composition. There are also considerations of the specific problems of music and language and the problem of methodology and elaborations of the musical/cultural concepts of <b>noise,</b> <b>listening</b> and silence, and also the idea of music as a form of prophecy. The theoretical section outlines the pessimistic cultural/musical theory of Theodor W. Adorno and also discusses the work of Renato Poggioli, Peter Burger, Jacques Attali, Ernst Bloch, Mikhail Bakhtin and Roland Barthes, considering ways in which it is possible to go beyond Adorno. It is proposed that the avant-garde be regarded not as an element of elite or institutionalised culture but of contemporary popular culture and that culture be understood as a source of a polyphonic, dialogic diversity. Contra Adorno, jazz is considered as one form which has historically produced an avant garde and a multiplicity of form. The prehistory and path of development of free music are briefly considered an ideal-theoretical model of its character as an avant-garde cultural activity proposed. The open-ended oral histories and discussions with musicians in the extensive appendices help reflect the multiplistic character of the avant-garde and provide many perspectives and discourses which support, conflict, and counterpoint the arguments developed by the author.

40|$|The {{mobility}} that is {{made possible}} with a cordless handset introduces {{the issues of the}} handset being used in different environments concerning background noise. This Master thesis investigates what essential frequency regions that are most important for intelligibility within the telephone bandwidth when the handset is used as a receiver in industry <b>noise.</b> <b>Listening</b> tests were performed for the investigations. A measure called Speech Reception Threshold in Noise (SRTN) was chosen for the investigation of speech perception in the handset. These measures were concluded with Parameter Estimation by Sequential Testing (PEST). A Swedish sentence material was used for the measures and the background noise was binaurally recorded with a manikin head. Performing the listening test included a graphical computer interface developed in Matlab that let the test subject control the pace of the test procedure. The data analysis was performed in SPSS. The overall results show the attenuation of low to mid frequency content results in lower SRTN than attenuation of the high frequency content within the telephone bandwidth. The main causes for these results depend on two coinciding factors. The background noise in this study is stronger for lower frequency content and thus performs more masking of low frequency to mid frequency content in the speech signals. Furthermore,the frequency region up to 2000 Hz is important for the formants F 1 and F 2 in vowel sounds as well as in consonant sounds. The best results in SRTN were obtained for two speech programs with 6 dB attenuation around the 1 / 3 octave bands ranging from 315 - 1000 Hz and 630 - 2000 Hz. The overall SRTN results in these speech programs were approximately 3 dB less compared to no attenuation,which resulted in - 19 dB (SRTN). 6 dB attenuation around the 1 / 3 -octave band centred at 2 kHz resulted in the lowest SRTN of about 6 dB less than with no attenuation. Low SRTN was also produced by 6 dB attenuation around the 1 / 3 -octave bands ranging between 1600 - 3200 Hz, resulting in values of about 5 dB less than with no attenuation...|$|E

Objective: To relate noises from cervical and pulmonary auscultations. Method: Prospective, clinical and experimental, quantitative and comparative study between the cervical and the pulmonary auscultations and sample composed by 19 adult patients with clinical diagnosis of oropharyngeal neurogenic dysphagia, after encephalic vascular accident, with mean age of 59. 11 years. We established percentages for variables considering two evaluators. The statistical analysis confirms the presence of slight dysphagia in 66. 67 %; moderate dysphagia in 16. 67 % and severe dysphagia in 16. 67 %. In the cervical auscultation the presence of dry clicks occurred between 42. 11 % and 78. 95 % for the different evaluators, and we observed a higher frequency of alterations for evaluator 1. In the pulmonary auscultation the higher frequency was of normal vesicular respiration for both evaluators. We also verified {{a significant difference between}} the levels of dysphagia for the cervical and pulmonary auscultations variables, whose correlation shows a low concordance; and a significant discordance between the evaluators for the cervical auscultation and perfect concordance for the pulmonary auscultation. Conclusion: there is no relationship between the <b>noises</b> <b>listened,</b> even with the respiratory function as a base and with the evaluation region being close; but we confirm a relation between dysphagia and pulmonary auscultation, whose results set a frequency of 100 % of alterations in the pulmonary auscultation in the dysphagia pictures, with moderate and severe affection levels...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} tasks of speech signal {{processing}} aims at increasing the intelligibility of speech.

Recent research results indicate a correlation between listening effort and speech intelligibility. Therefore, we propose to use our measure for both intelligibility enhancement for algorithms being operated at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and listening effort improvement at high SNRs.

40|$|An Empirical Mode Decomposition based {{filtering}} (EMDF) {{approach is}} presented as a post-processing stage for speech enhancement. This method is particularly effective in low frequency noise environments. Unlike previous EMD based denoising methods, this approach does not make the assumption that the contaminating noise signal is fractional Gaussian Noise. An adaptive method is developed to select the IMF index for separating the noise components from the speech based on the second-order IMF statistics. The low frequency noise components are then separated by a partial reconstruction from the IMFs. It is shown that the proposed EMDF technique is able to suppress residual noise from speech signals that were enhanced by the conventional optimallymodified log-spectral amplitude approach which uses a minimum statistics based noise estimate. A comparative performance study is included that demonstrates the effectiveness of the EMDF system in various noise environments, such as car interior noise, military vehicle noise and babble noise.

These six tests were realised by 64 subjects. Different items were examined for each test: its perceived and real duration, its estimated difficulty, the accuracy of merit scores attributed to noises, the perceptual spaces which could be built and the accuracy of a pleasantness indicator computed from the results. It appeared that:- the second procedure can propose a good compromise between the accuracy of the results and the time needed for subjects to realise the test. Thus, it can be recommended for many industrial purposes;- however, the not-forced choice paired comparisons enable a greater discrimination between stimuli;- perceptual spaces built from the paired comparison tests and the similarity rating one were similar, indicating a great stability of sound features used by listeners, whatever their task. ...|$|R
