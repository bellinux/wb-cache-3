500|$|... 1939 was a {{bad year}} for Benchley's career. Besides the {{cancellation}} of his radio show, Benchley learned that MGM did not plan to renew his contract, and The New Yorker, frustrated with Benchley's film career taking precedence over his theatre column, appointed Wolcott Gibbs to take over in his stead. Following his final New Yorker column in 1940, Benchley signed with Paramount Pictures for another series of one-reel shorts, all filmed at Paramount's Long Island studio in Astoria, New York. Most of them were adapted from his old essays ("Take the Witness!," [...] with Benchley fantasizing about conquering a tough cross-examination, was filmed as The Witness; [...] "The Real Public Enemies," [...] showing the criminal tendencies of sinister household objects, was filmed as Crime Control, etc.). In 1940 Benchley appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent {{for which he is}} also credited as one of the dialogue writers. In 1941 Benchley received two more feature-length roles: Walt Disney's The Reluctant Dragon, in which Benchley tours the various departments of the Disney studio, and <b>Nice</b> <b>Girl?</b> with Deanna Durbin, noteworthy for a rare dramatic performance by Benchley.|$|E

Michael D. Klemm of cinemaqueer.com reflected on how the film broke many of the taboos with interracial sexuality and homosexuality. He praised Cardinale's [...] "terrific" [...] acting and portrayal of the [...] "overbearing" [...] mother, likening one scene, where she [...] "brings home a <b>nice</b> <b>girl</b> for Malik (Antonin Stahly) to meet", to Harold and Maude (1971).
