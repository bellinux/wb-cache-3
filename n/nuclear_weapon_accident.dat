40|$|The {{source term}} {{literature}} was reviewed to estimate aerosolized and respirable release fractions for accidents involving plutonium in high-explosive (HE) detonation and in fuel fires. For HE detonation, all estimates {{are based on}} the total amount of Pu. For fuel fires, all estimates {{are based on the}} amount of Pu oxidized. I based my estimates for HE detonation primarily upon the results from the Roller Coaster experiment. For hydrocarbon fuel fire oxidation of plutonium, I based lower bound values on laboratory experiments which represent accident scenarios with very little turbulence and updraft of a fire. Expected values for aerosolization were obtained from the Vixen A field tests, which represent a realistic case for modest turbulence and updraft, and for respirable fractions from some laboratory experiments involving large samples of Pu. Upper bound estimates for credible accidents are based on experiments involving combustion of molten plutonium droplets. In May of 1991 the DOE Pilot Safety Study Program established a group of experts to estimate the fractions of plutonium which would be aerosolized and respirable for certain <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>accident</b> scenarios...|$|E

40|$|The Atmospheric Release Advisory Capability (ARAC) was {{requested}} to estimate credible worst-case dose, air concentration, and deposition of airborne hazardous materials {{that would result}} from a worst-case detonation accident at the proposed Advanced Hydrotest Facility (AHT) at the Nevada Test Site (NTS). Consequences were estimated at the closest onsite facility, the Device Assembly Facility (DOFF), and offsite location (intersection of Highway and U. S. 95). The materials considered in this analysis were weapon-grade plutonium, beryllium, and hydrogen fluoride which is a combustion product whose concentration is dependent upon the quantity of high explosives. The analysis compares the calculated results with action guidelines published by the Department of Defense in DoD 5100. 52 -M (<b>Nuclear</b> <b>Weapon</b> <b>Accident</b> Response Procedures). Results indicate that based on a one kg release of plutonium the whole body radiation dose {{could be as high}} as 3 Rem at the DOFF. This level approaches the 5 Rem level for which the Department of Defense requires respiratory protection, recommends sheltering and the consideration of evacuation. Deposition levels at the DOFF could approach 6 uCi/m{sup 2 } for which the Department of Defense recommends access on a need-only basis and suggests that a possible controlled evacuation might be required. For a one kg release of plutonium, the dose at the nearest off-site location could reach 0. 5. At this level, the Department of Defense suggests that sheltering be considered. For a one kg release of beryllium, the peak 5 -minute concentration at the DOFF could be as as 20 % of 6 xlO{sup - 3 } mg/m{sup 2 } which is the applicable by Response Planning Guideline (ERPG- 1). At the nearest offsite location, the beryllium concentrations from a one kg release would be two orders of magnitude less than the same guideline. For the detonation of 100 kg of the explosive LX- 17, the concentration of hydrogen fluoride at both the DOFF and the nearest offsite location would be four orders of magnitude less than the lowest applicable Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG- 1). The calculations and analysis reported here indicate that emergency response planning for such an accident at the present proposed location of the ABF should include provisions for the protection of personnel located at the DOFF and their possible evacuation...|$|E

Because of their political and military importance, destructive power, and the potential consequences of an accident or unauthorized act, <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> and <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> systems require special consideration and protection against risks and threats inherent in their peacetime and wartime environments. The Air Force, {{in conjunction with other}} entities within the Departments of Defense or Energy, achieves a high standard of protection through a stringent nuclear surety program.

The Air Force continues to pursue safe, secure and effective <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> consistent with operational requirements.

S. <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>accidents</b> are classified for national security reasons and cannot be disposed in WIPP. The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) sought an alternative disposal method for these "special case " TRU wastes and from 1984 to 1987, four Greater Confinement Disposal (GCD) boreholes were used to place these special case TRU wastes a minimum of 21 m (70 ft) below the land surface and a minimum of 200 m (650 ft) above the water table. The GCD boreholes are located in arid alluvium at the DOE's Nevada Test Site (NTS). Because of state regulatory concerns, the GCD boreholes have not been used for waste disposal since 1989. DOE requires that TRU waste disposal facilities meet the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) requirements for disposal of TRU wastes, which are contained in 40 CFR 191.

The sedimentation rates in the lakes varied from 0. 4 mm a(- 1) (5 a a(- 1) to 1. 6 mm a(- 1) (82 mg cm(- 2) a(- 1)). With these sedimentation rates, {{it is not possible to}} resolve the Pu- 239,Pu- 240 global fallout peak from a possible Pu- 239,Pu- 240 "accident" peak in the sediment depth profiles. However, the Pu- 239,Pu- 240 /Cs- 137 and the Pu- 238 /Pu- 239,Pu- 240 ratios agreed well with global fallout ratios, indicating that plutonium originating from the accident had not reached these lakes. This also indicates that the Thule air base community has probably only been exposed to radionuclides from the accident to a very limited extent. A limited study showed that Pb- 210 could not be used as a normalizing nuclide to explain the transport of transuranic elements from the catchment area to the lake, i. e.
