25|$|The public {{transportation}} is well {{developed in the}} city. Buses are the major means of public transport in Guwahati. The Assam State Transport Corporation (ASTC) and private operators provide the city bus services within the city. ASTC operates the Volvo air-conditioned bus services within the city {{as well as to}} the LGBI airport. In addition to this, there are a number of bus operators which regularly run day and night buses from Guwahati to neighbouring towns and cities. Rupnath Brahma Inter-State Bus Terminus (ISBT), located at Betkuchi area on NH-37, is the most significant terminal cum transit point for buses plying between Guwahati and other destinations in Assam and Northeast India. The areas of Adabari and Paltan Bazaar also act as <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> in providing bus services to towns and cities in Assam and adjoining states.|$|E

2500|$|Material {{is ground}} away from {{underside}} of the bars in an arch shape to lower the pitch. [...] This allows the lower-pitched bars to be a manageable length. It is also {{the key to the}} [...] "mellow" [...] sound of the vibraphone (and marimba, which uses the same deep arch) compared with the xylophone, which uses a shallower arch, and the glockenspiel, which has no arch at all. [...] Vibrating rectangular bars have three primary modes of vibration. The deep arch causes these modes to align and create a consonant arrangement of intervals: a fundamental pitch, a pitch two octaves above that, and a third pitch an octave and a major third above the second. [...] For the F3 bar that usually forms the lowest note on a vibraphone, there would be F3 as the fundamental, F5 as the first overtone and A6 as the second overtone. As a side effect, the arch causes the <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> of the fundamental vibration to shift closer towards the ends of the bar.|$|E
50|$|The {{front and}} rear <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> have the {{property}} that a ray aimed at {{one of them will}} be refracted by the lens such that it appears to have come from the other, and with the same angle with respect to the optical axis.

If the medium {{on both sides of the}} optical system is the same (e.g., air), then the {{front and rear}} <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> coincide with the front and rear principal points, respectively.|$|E

30|$|Nodal {{analysis}} {{can be used}} to estimate the onset of liquid loading in gas wells with more accuracy since it considers the complete flow path of fluids from reservoir to wellhead (Nallaparaju et al. 2012). In nodal analysis, the system is divided into two subsystems at a certain location called <b>nodal</b> <b>point.</b> The first subsystem takes into account inflow from reservoir to <b>nodal</b> <b>point</b> (IPR), while the other subsystem considers outflow from the <b>nodal</b> <b>point</b> to the surface (TPR). The curves formed by this relation on the pressure–rate graph are called the inflow curve and the outflow curve, respectively. The point where these two curves intersect denotes the optimum operating point where pressure and flow rate are equal for both of the curves. Turner’s critical rate prediction in relation with the IPR and TPR curves {{can be used to}} predict liquid loading.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>nodal</b> <b>point</b> {{in the eye}} is {{the point}} at which [...] "lines {{connecting}} points in the scene and corresponding points in the image intersect." [...] In chameleons, the <b>nodal</b> <b>point</b> is located a significant distance before the center of rotation, the point around which the eye rotates in the eye socket. As a result of this <b>nodal</b> <b>point</b> separation, images of objects move more or less on the retina based on whether they are farther or closer away. The position of an image on the retina is the [...] "primary means by which chameleons judge distance." [...] Therefore, the rotation of one eye informs the chameleon of the [...] "relative distances of different objects." [...] An important effect of the ability to judge distance with one eye is that the head {{does not have to be}} turned to allow stereoptic viewing of the object.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} ray optics of {{generalized}} lenses (glenses), which are ideal thin lenses generalized {{to have different}} object- and image-sided focal lengths, and the most general light-ray-direction-changing surfaces that stigmatically image any point in object space to a corresponding point in image space. Gabor superlenses [UK patent 541, 753 (1940); J. Opt. A 1, 94 (1999) [CrossRef]] {{can be seen as}} pixelated realizations of glenses. Our analysis is centered on the <b>nodal</b> <b>point.</b> Whereas the <b>nodal</b> <b>point</b> of a thin lens always resides in the lens plane, that of a glens can reside anywhere on the optical axis. Utilizing the <b>nodal</b> <b>point,</b> we derive simple equations that describe the mapping between object and image space and the light-ray-direction change.

Glenses allow novel optical instruments to be realized, at least theoretically, and our results facilitate the design and analysis of such devices...|$|R
