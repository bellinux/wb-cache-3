The style has become known as the iceberg theory, because, as Baker describes it, in Hemingway's writing the hard facts float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight. Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices to write about life in general—not only his life. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the [...] "theory of omission". Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface.|$|E

500|$|Hemingway was {{inspired}} by Ezra Pound's writings and applied the principles of imagism to his own work. Pound's influence {{can be seen in}} the stripped-down, minimalist style [...] characteristic in Hemingway's early fiction. Betraying his admiration for the older writer, he admitted that Pound [...] "taught [...] more about how to write and how not to write than any son of a bitch alive". He also learned from James Joyce, who further instilled the idea of stripped down economic prose. Hemingway's short stories from the 1920s adhere to Pound's tight definition of imagism; biographer Carlos Baker writes that in his short stories Hemingway tried to learn how to [...] "get the most from the least, [...] prune language, [...] multiply intensities, [...] tell <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth". Hemingway adapted this style into a technique he called his iceberg theory: as Baker describes it, the hard facts float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight.|$|E
500|$|Because {{he began}} as a writer of short stories, Baker {{believes}} Hemingway learned to [...] "get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities and how to tell <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> {{in a way that}} allowed for telling more than the truth." [...] Hemingway called his style the Iceberg Theory: the facts float above water; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out of sight. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the [...] "theory of omission". Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing (such as Nick Adams fishing in [...] "The Big Two-Hearted River") though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface (Nick Adams concentrating on fishing {{to the extent that he}} does not have to think about anything else). [...] Paul Smith writes that Hemingway's first stories, collected as In Our Time, showed he was still experimenting with his writing style. He avoided complicated syntax. About 70 percent of the sentences are simple sentences—a childlike syntax without subordination.|$|E

In his packet Mr. Prendergast sent copies of documents and of verbal evidence which he had managed to obtain; <b>but</b> with <b>the</b> actual details of these it is not necessary that I should trouble those who are following me in this story.

[...] Beckinsale received a Critic's Choice Award nomination for her performance. The film never received a full theatrical release after the distributor filed for bankruptcy and the film has grossed just $186,702 worldwide. [...] "I have prayed—prayed—for film companies to go bankrupt on films I've made, and then this happens on the one I love," [...] said Beckinsale.

One of the first orders of business on that Monday was to deal with Wheelwright, whose case had been long deferred by Winthrop in hopes that he might finally see the error of his ways. When asked if he was ready to confess his offenses, Wheelwright responded that [...] "he was not guilty, that he had preached <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> of Christ, and he was not responsible for the application they [...] made of it". Winthrop painted a picture of a peaceful colony before Wheelwright's arrival, and how after his fast-day sermon Boston men refused to join the Pequot War effort, Pastor Wilson was often slighted, and controversy arose in town meetings. The court urged him to leave the colony voluntarily, but this he would not do, seeing such a move as being an admission of guilt. Wheelwright was steadfast in his demeanor, but was not sentenced as the court adjourned for the evening. On Tuesday, after further argument in the case, the court declared him guilty and read the sentence: ...|$|E

6000|$|... “Another {{point on}} {{which there is}} much misapprehension {{on the part of}} Socialists, as well as of trades-unionists and other partisans of labor against capital, relates to the {{proportion}} in which the produce of the country is really shared and the amount of what is actually diverted from those who produce it, to enrich other persons. When, for instance, a capitalist invests £20,000 in his business, and draws from it an income of (suppose) £2,000 a year, the common impression is {{as if he were the}} beneficial owner both of the £20,000 and of the £2,000, while <b>the</b> laborers own <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> their wages. <b>The</b> <b>truth,</b> however, is that he only obtains the £2,000 on condition of applying no part of the £20,000 to his own use. He has the legal control over it, and might squander it if he chose, but if he did he would not have the £2,000 a year also. For all personal purposes they have the capital and he has <b>but</b> <b>the</b> profits, which it only yields to him on condition that the capital itself is employed in satisfying not his own wants, but those of laborers. Even of his own share a small part only belongs to him as the owner of capital. The portion of the produce which falls to capital merely as capital is measured by the interest of money, since that is all that the owner of capital obtains when he contributes to production nothing except the capital itself.|$|R
60|$|Another {{peculiarity}} of the German coachman is that {{he never}} attempts to pull in or to pull up. He regulates his rate of speed, not by the pace of <b>the</b> horse, <b>but</b> by manipulation of the brake. For eight miles an hour he puts it on slightly, so that it only scrapes the wheel, producing a continuous sound as of the sharpening of a saw; for four miles an hour he screws it down harder, and you travel to an accompaniment of groans and shrieks, suggestive of a symphony of dying pigs. When he desires {{to come to a}} full stop, he puts it on to its full. If his brake be a good one, he calculates he can stop his carriage, unless the horse be an extra powerful animal, in less than twice its own length. Neither the German driver nor the German horse knows, apparently, that you can stop a carriage by any other method. The German horse continues to pull with his full strength until he finds it impossible to move the vehicle another inch; then he rests. Horses of other countries are quite willing to stop when the idea is suggested to them. I have known horses content to go even quite slowly. But your German horse, seemingly, is built for one particular speed, and is unable to depart from it. I am stating <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> literal, unadorned <b>truth,</b> when I say I have seen a German coachman, with the reins lying loose over the splash-board, working his brake with both hands, in terror lest he would not be in time to avoid a collision.|$|R
