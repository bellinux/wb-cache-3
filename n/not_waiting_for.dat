5|$|After his acquittal, Blackburn {{remained}} in Canada to avoid arrest and prosecution by U.S. authorities. When {{he learned of}} a yellow fever outbreak in New Orleans and the Texas Gulf Coast, Blackburn wrote to President Andrew Johnson on September 4, 1867, asking permission {{to return to the}} U.S. and help treat the disease. <b>Not</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> Johnson's response—which never came—Blackburn returned to the U.S., arriving in Louisville on September 25, 1867, en route to New Orleans. After rendering aid during the epidemic, he and his family moved to an Arkansas plantation owned by his wife.|$|E

25|$|Generally {{a loaf of}} leavened {{bread is}} used as an emblem of Christ's body – though many {{assemblies}} use unleavened bread or matzos. After giving thanks for the loaf, it is broken and circulated to the quiet, seated congregation. Congregants will break off small pieces, or take small pieces of broken unleavened bread, as it is passed, and eat them individually (i.e. <b>not</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> a group invitation to consume it together). At this time, the worshipper usually engages in silent prayerful worship of the Lord Jesus Christ.|$|E

25|$|After Emperor Charles's {{death on}} 20 October, Frederick quickly {{resolved}} to strike first; on 8 November {{he ordered the}} mobilization of the Prussian army, and on 11 December he issued an ultimatum to Maria Theresa demanding the surrender of Silesia. In return, he promised to acknowledge the Pragmatic Sanction and to give his vote as elector of Brandenburg in the imperial election to Maria Theresa's husband, Duke Francis Stephen of Lorraine. <b>Not</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> a response, he then led his troops across the lightly defended Silesian frontier on 16 December 1740, beginning the First Silesian War.|$|E
25|$|The Cubists are <b>not</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> {{the war to}} end to recommence {{hostilities}} against good sense. They are exhibiting at the Galerie Poiret naked {{women whose}} scattered parts are represented in all {{four corners of the}} canvas: here an eye, there an ear, over there a hand, a foot on top, a mouth below. M. Picasso, their leader, is possibly the least disheveled of the lot. He has painted, or rather daubed, five women who are, if the truth be told, all hacked up, and yet their limbs somehow manage to hold together. They have, moreover, piggish faces with eyes wandering negligently above their ears. An enthusiastic art-lover offered the artist 20,000 francs for this masterpiece. M. Picasso wanted more. The art-lover did not insist.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom {{planned to}} launch a two-pronged attack on Madrid {{in the fall of}} 1809. In the west, Del Parque's Army of the Left enjoyed some success against Marchand's weak VI Corps. When the Spanish general learned that the other {{offensive}} prong had been crushed at Ocaña, he turned around and began retreating rapidly to the south. At the same time, Marchand was reinforced by a dragoon division under Kellermann. Taking command, Kellermann raced in pursuit of the Army of the Left, catching up with it at Alba de Tormes. <b>Not</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> their own foot soldiers, the French dragoons and light cavalry fell upon the Spanish infantry and defeated it. Marchand's infantry arrived in time to mop up, but the cavalry had done most of the fighting. Del Parque's men retreated into the mountains where they spent a miserable few months.|$|E

25|$|At Liberty Gap, 6 {{miles to}} the west, a similar battle occurred. The leading {{elements}} of McCook's advance was the 39th Indiana, commanded by Col. Thomas J. Harrison, which was also mounted and armed with Spencer rifles. Taking a few prisoners of the Confederate pickets that opposed them, they {{found that there were}} only two Confederate regiments in the Gap. <b>Not</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the main infantry support to arrive, McCook ordered the brigade of Brig. Gen. August Willich to move forward as quickly as possible. Deploying a regiment {{on each side of the}} road, Willich's men drove up the slope. A frontal assault against the breastworks was not feasible, so a fierce battle of flanking maneuvers resulted against the Confederate brigades of Brig. Gens. St. John R. Liddell and Patrick R. Cleburne. As a second Union brigade arrived in the evening to support Willich, the Union troops had pushed a half mile beyond the southern entrance to the Gap.|$|E
25|$|Rommel {{lost contact}} with General Hermann Hoth, having disobeyed orders by <b>not</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the French to {{establish}} a new line of defence. The 7th Panzer Division continued to advance north-west to Avesnes-sur-Helpe, just ahead of the 1st and 2nd Panzer divisions. The French 5th Motorised Infantry Division had bivouacked {{in the path of the}} German division, with its vehicles neatly lined up along the roadsides and the 7th Panzer Division dashed through them. The slow speed, overloaded crews and lack of battlefield communications undid the French. The 5th Panzer Division joined in the fight. The French inflicted many losses on the division but could not cope with the speed of the German mobile units, which closed fast and destroyed the French armour at close range. The remaining elements of the 1st DCR, resting after losing all but 16 of its tanks in Belgium, were also engaged and defeated, the 1st DCR retiring with three operational tanks for a German loss of 50 out of 500 tanks.|$|E
25|$|On July 17 at Money in the Bank, Bryan won the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match {{which earned}} him a World Heavyweight Championship match at any point within the {{following}} year. On the July 22 episode of SmackDown, Bryan declared he would cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase at WrestleMania XXVIII. After several months of losing matches, Bryan began a feud with then World Heavyweight Champion Mark Henry on the November 4 episode of SmackDown, after Henry challenged Bryan to a non-title match to prove that Bryan could not become champion. During the match, Big Show knocked out Henry, making Bryan lose by disqualification. Big Show, {{as a friend of}} Bryan, then urged a groggy Bryan to cash in his championship match, but Henry recovered and attacked both Bryan and Big Show before the match could start. After losing a rematch, Bryan suffered attacks from Henry the following two weeks. On November 25 at SmackDown, Henry was knocked out again by Big Show, at which point Bryan cashed in his briefcase for a title match and quickly pinned Henry. However, SmackDown authority figure Theodore Long revealed that Henry was not medically cleared to compete and voided the match, so Henry remained champion and the briefcase was returned to Bryan. Bryan later admitted he betrayed his principles by <b>not</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> WrestleMania, but explained he felt strongly about exacting revenge on Henry and realised he may not make it to WrestleMania due to Henry's continued attacks. Regardless of his briefcase, Bryan won a four-way match on the same episode of SmackDown to become the contender for Henry's championship. On the live November 29 episode of SmackDown, Henry managed to pin Bryan to retain his title in a steel cage match. Also in November, Bryan started being involved in a romantic storyline with AJ.|$|E

500|$|Soon, Major-Generals Bruce and Bergholtz {{turned to}} Apraksin with a {{proposal}} to assault the fort, <b>not</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> [...] "the production of an opening". Their reasoning was that they could end up losing more soldiers from injuries and disease than they would during an assault. Peter, having found out about this from a letter by Apraksin, decided it to be [...] "very significant, but also very dangerous." [...] In the end he left the decision up to General Apraksin who, not wanting to bear the responsibility for a failure, decided to wait for reinforcements to arrive by sea once the ice had opened up.|$|E
500|$|In the Tests, Chapman scored 165 runs at 23.57, {{and in all}} {{first-class}} matches {{he reached}} 533 runs and averaged 33.31. Southerton summarised his performance: [...] "Chapman himself began well in batting but in the later matches was too prone to lash out at the off ball and, as the tour progressed, the Australian bowlers discovered his weakness." [...] On his captaincy, Southerton wrote: [...] "Chapman captained the side uncommonly well, improving out of all knowledge as the tour progressed." [...] Socially, Chapman enjoyed the tour; he attended many functions and events; Bill Ferguson, the team scorer, only saw him annoyed once on the tour: when his accustomed drink was <b>not</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> him at a lunch interval.|$|E
500|$|Gottesman {{was one of}} the presenters at the 1995 {{conference at}} the Aspen Institute in Maryland on how {{strongly}} genes controlled a person's leaning toward violence and crime. Gottesman presented results from studies on the influence of genes in criminality, stating that identical twins separated at birth were likely to show similar levels of criminal behavior. This concordance indicated that genes influenced such behavior. He did point out that behavioral patterns were strongly influenced by the environment and not set by genes alone. [...] The conference, funded by the National Institutes of Health, was contentious, with detractors arguing that such studies would lead to minority groups, more likely to be criminals because they had lower social status or were poor, being targeted with gene therapy for violence. Protesters disrupted the conference and swarmed into the auditorium. Gottesman reasserted his belief that scientists should proceed with the research, <b>not</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> humanity to become ethical enough not to misuse it.|$|E

500|$|On {{arriving}} back in England, Trenchard visited Lady Dudley {{to thank her}} and then set about engineering his return to South Africa. [...] His lung was not fully healed, causing him pain and leaving him breathless. [...] Furthermore, the War Office were sceptical about Trenchard's claim to be fully fit and were disinclined {{to allow him to}} forgo his remaining nine months of sick leave. [...] Trenchard then took several months of tennis coaching in order to strengthen his remaining lung. [...] Early in the summer of 1901 he entered two tennis competitions, reaching the semi-finals both times and gaining favourable press coverage. [...] He then sent the newspaper clippings to the doctors at the War Office, arguing that this tennis ability proved he was fit for active service. [...] <b>Not</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> a reply, Trenchard boarded a troop ship in May 1901, passing himself off as a volunteer for a second tour of duty.|$|E
500|$|The New Zealand riflemen soon {{gained a}} footing on Mount Royston, aided by {{accurate}} and rapid shooting from the Somerset Royal Horse Artillery Battery. By 16:00, the attack had proceeded {{to a point}} where Chaytor arranged with the 5th Mounted Brigade for a squadron of Royal Gloucestershire Hussars and two troops of the Worcestershire Yeomanry to gallop against the southern spur of Mount Royston. They easily took the spur, the defenders <b>not</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the onslaught of the mounted charge. [...] From the crest of the spur, the Gloucestershire squadron shot down the horse teams of an Austrian, German or Ottoman battery of pack guns concentrated in the hollow behind the spur, and the attacking force began to surrender. The New Zealand Mounted Rifle and 5th Mounted Brigades were supported by leading infantry battalions of the 127th (Manchester) Brigade (which had just arrived) when Ottoman and German soldiers began to surrender en masse. At about 18:00, 500 prisoners, two machine guns and the pack battery were captured, and the outer flank of the attacking force was completely routed.|$|E
