5|$|Initially, Cruz {{focused on}} dance, having studied {{classical}} ballet {{for nine years}} at Spain's National Conservatory. She took three years of Spanish ballet training and four years of theatre at Cristina Rota's <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>school.</b> She says that ballet instilled in her discipline that would be important in her future acting career. When she became a cinephile at 10 or 11, her father bought a Betamax machine, which was then a very rare thing to own in her neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the only}} {{galleries}} who {{were prepared to}} show the so-called <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>School</b> (Robert Motherwell's term) were Parsons Gallery, the Samuel Kootz Gallery and the Charles Egan Gallery. To these fledgling galleries it was a financial disaster. The highest price paid for a Pollock, before 1947, was $740 and Rothko had peaked with {{the sale of a}} $120 painting in 1946. At the Kootz Gallery, from 1946 to 1948, Hans Hoffman, William Baziotes and Robert Motherwell were offered at between $100 and $950, likely fetching much lower actual sales prices. Kootz closed in 1948 {{as a result of the}} financial strain. The critical and financial success of the group would only come after a series of popularising articles in Life magazine, most notably a feature on Jackson Pollock in 1949 and the Irascibles article and photograph of 1951.|$|E

25|$|After {{his return}} in 1953, Twombly {{served in the}} U.S. army as a cryptologist, an {{activity}} that left a distinct mark on his artistic style. From 1955 to 1959, he worked in New York, where he became a prominent figure {{among a group of}} artists including Robert Rauschenberg, with whom he was sharing a studio, and Jasper Johns. Exposure to the emerging <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>School</b> purged figurative aspects from his work, encouraging a simplified form of abstraction. He became fascinated with tribal art, using the painterly language of the early 1950s to invoke primitivism, reversing the normal evolution of the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>School.</b> Twombly soon developed a technique of gestural drawing that was characterized by thin white lines on a dark canvas that appear to be scratched onto the surface. His early sculptures, assembled from discarded objects, similarly cast their gaze back to Europe and North Africa. He stopped making sculptures in 1959 and did not take up sculpting again until 1976.|$|E
25|$|Hopper began art {{studies with}} a {{correspondence}} course in 1899. Soon {{he transferred to}} the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>School</b> of Art and Design, the forerunner of Parsons The New School for Design. There he studied for six years, with teachers including William Merritt Chase, who instructed him in oil painting. Early on, Hopper modeled his style after Chase and French Impressionist masters Édouard Manet and Edgar Degas. Sketching from live models proved a challenge and a shock for the conservatively raised Hopper.|$|E

25|$|While the {{movement}} is closely associated with painting, and painters such as Arshile Gorky, Franz Kline, Clyfford Still, Hans Hofmann, Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, and others, collagist Anne Ryan and certain sculptors in particular were also integral to abstract expressionism. David Smith, and his wife Dorothy Dehner, Herbert Ferber, Isamu Noguchi, Ibram Lassaw, Theodore Roszak, Phillip Pavia, Mary Callery, Richard Stankiewicz, Louise Bourgeois, and Louise Nevelson in particular {{were some of the}} sculptors considered as being important members of {{the movement}}. In addition, the artists David Hare, John Chamberlain, James Rosati, Mark di Suvero, and sculptors Richard Lippold, Raoul Hague, George Rickey, Reuben Nakian, and even Tony Smith, Seymour Lipton, Joseph Cornell, and several others were integral parts of the Abstract expressionist movement. Many of the sculptors listed participated in the Ninth Street Show, a famous exhibition curated by Leo Castelli on East Ninth Street in New York City in 1951. Besides the painters and sculptors of the period the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>School</b> of Abstract expressionism also generated a number of supportive poets, including Frank O'Hara and photographers such as Aaron Siskind and Fred McDarrah, (whose book The Artist's World in Pictures documented the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>School</b> during the 1950s), and filmmakers—notably Robert Frank—as well.|$|E
25|$|Two Japanese {{international}} day schools serving {{elementary and}} junior high school levels, the Japanese School of New York in Greenwich, Connecticut and the New Jersey Japanese School in Oakland, New Jersey serve the Greater New York City area. Prior to 1991, the Japanese School of New York was in New York City. The New Jersey school opened in 1992 as a branch campus of the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>school</b> and became its own school in 1999. The Keio Academy of New York, a Japanese boarding high school, is located in Harrison, New York.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} after World War II, {{a group of young}} New York artists known as the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>School</b> formed the first truly {{original}} school of painting in America that exerted a major influence on foreign artists: abstract expressionism. Among the movement's leaders were Jackson Pollock (1912–1956), Willem de Kooning (1904–1997), and Mark Rothko (1903–1970). The abstract expressionists abandoned formal composition and representation of real objects to concentrate on instinctual arrangements of space and color and to demonstrate the effects of the physical action of painting on the canvas.|$|E

New York City has been considered the dance capital of the world. The city is also frequently the setting for novels, movies (see List of films set in New York City), and television programs.

25|$|D'Ascenzo {{dabbled in}} stained glass {{on his own}} for several years, and studied the craft at the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>School</b> of Design, {{sometime}} around 1900. He completed his first stained glass commission in 1904. Initially, he bought glass from local manufacturers, but soon began making his own. Beginning in 1911, he spent his summers in Europe, making a comprehensive study of stained glass in cathedrals. In 1921, he was granted permission to set up scaffolding inside Chartres Cathedral for several weeks, to sketch and examine the windows up close. The following summer {{he did the same}} at Leon Cathedral in Spain.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s Richard Diebenkorn began his Ocean Park series; created {{during the final}} 25 years of his career and they are {{important}} examples of color field painting. The Ocean Park series exemplified by Ocean Park No.129, connects his earlier abstract expressionist works with Color field painting. During the early 1950s, Richard Diebenkorn was known as an abstract expressionist, and his gestural abstractions were close to the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>School</b> in sensibility but firmly based in the San Francisco abstract expressionist sensibility; a place where Clyfford Still has a considerable influence on younger artists {{by virtue of his}} teaching at the San Francisco Art Institute.|$|E

25|$|In a {{broad and}} general sense, one finds European roots of minimalism in the {{geometric}} abstractions of painters associated with the Bauhaus, {{in the works of}} Kazimir Malevich, Piet Mondrian and other artists associated with the De Stijl movement, and the Russian Constructivist movement, and {{in the work of the}} Romanian sculptor Constantin Brâncuși. Minimal art is also inspired in part by the paintings of Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt, Josef Albers, and the works of artists as diverse as Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, Giorgio Morandi, and others. Minimalism was also a reaction against the painterly subjectivity of Abstract Expressionism that had been dominant in the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>School</b> during the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
