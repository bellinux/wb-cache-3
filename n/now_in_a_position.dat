5|$|Another {{part of the}} 5th Division had {{gathered}} unseen below Courtnay's Post, which was held by the 14th Battalion, and at 04:00 they rushed the trench, throwing hand grenades. The post was only defended by an Australian section, two of whom were killed and another two wounded; as the Turks occupied {{that part of the}} post the surviving Australians retreated. The Turks were <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> to observe and bring fire down on Monash Valley. However, from another section of the post Private Albert Jacka led a small group of men in a counter-attack on the Turks. Jacka shot five of the Turks, bayoneted another two, and chased the rest out of the post. For this feat he was awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the {{rebellion}} in August 1948 the Colorado Party, which had been out of power since 1904, had almost total control in Paraguay. The fighting had simplified politics by eliminating all other parties and by reducing the size of the army. As 90% of the officer corps had joined the rebels, fewer individuals were <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> to compete for power.|$|E
25|$|Colour maps {{were sent}} to {{commercial}} printers for printing in five colours, with the overprinting being added after the map had been printed. This process was chosen as it gave a higher quality for the fine line-work than the industry standard four-colour process (CMYK). As computer and software technology has advanced, and the cost reduced, many clubs are <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> to print their own maps. This enables clubs to print the six colours together (map and overprinting symbols) using that same four-colour process, but with a reduction in quality over traditional printing. Printing costs can be minimised by using standard stock sizes of paper e.g. A4 or Letter. It is important to use the correct type of paper: both the weight and the coating affect the usability of the final map.|$|E

25|$|The Southwestern Front Red Army, and the South-Western Front, VVS, had {{suffered}} heavily {{and the three}} armies were effectively destroyed. But their delaying strategy tied down German forces for a month. They even succeeded in pushing back the 10th Panzer to Yelnya. The VVS, having suffered terrible losses, was <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> of numerical and qualitative inferiority. The Germans outnumbered the Soviets five to one in tanks, and two to one in artillery, but also two to one in serviceable aircraft. On 20 July the VVS KOVO had only 389 aircraft (103 fighters 286 bombers). The effectiveness of German fighter units, particularly JG 51, saw the new Pe-2 units nearly wiped out. 410 BAP lost 33 out of 38 bombers it had brought with it on 5 July. The IL-2 equipped 4 ShAP had only 10 of the 65 aircraft after just three weeks. The Soviets had cleverly concentrated their air power at Yelnya, and the mixture of a decline in Luftwaffe strength (to 600 in the central sector) compelled the Germans {{to withdraw from the}} salient.|$|E
25|$|The Kriegsmarine—Luftwaffe {{conflict}} continued {{along the}} same lines as before over the course of 1937 and 1938. Göring did not openly reject the claims of the navy, nor did he deny the importance of air power in sea warfare, which gave him plenty of latitude in discussions. Göring continued to show willingness to cooperate, but only in matters that the Luftwaffe could profit from the suggestions and research of the Kriegsmarine. He ordered the dismemberment of naval–air activities and organisations at his own discretion and according to his own plans. The position of the navy became weaker. Göring had been named Hitler's deputy for the Four Year Plan and he was <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> to govern all policy concerning the allocation of aerial resources. Under those circumstances it appears Raeder and the navy accepted that a naval air arm was not going to become a reality. The final confirmation of how the air and sea arms were to interact was decided at a conference on 27 February 1939 and ratified by a memorandum drawn up by Karl Bodenschatz (adjutant to Göring) signed by Göring and Raeder. The former would retain all control over naval air units and operational control would be exercised by a Luftwaffe officer assigned to the Kriegsmarine.|$|E
500|$|After {{holding onto}} the Albert Canal's west bank for nearly 36 hours, the 4th and 7th Belgian {{infantry}} divisions withdrew. The capture of Eben-Emael allowed the Germans to force through the Panzers of the 6th Army. The situation for the Belgian divisions was either to withdraw or be encircled. The Germans had advanced beyond Tongeren and were <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> to sweep south to Namur, which would threaten to envelop the entire Albert Canal and Liège positions. Under the circumstances, both divisions withdrew. On the evening of 11 May, the Belgian Command withdrew its forces behind the Namur–Antwerp line. The following day, the French 1st Army arrived at Gembloux, between Wavre and Namur, to cover the [...] "Gembloux gap". It was a flat area, devoid of prepared or entrenched positions.|$|E

500|$|With {{necessary}} funding available, the Airbus Supervisory Board {{approved the}} development of the A330 and A340 with potential customers on 27 January 1986. Its chairman Franz Josef Strauß stated afterwards that [...] "Airbus Industrie is <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, which is now officially designated the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments". The designations were originally reversed and were switched so the quad-jet airliner would have a [...] "4" [...] in its name. Airbus hoped for five airlines to sign for both the A330 and A340, and on 12 May sent sale proposals to the most likely candidates, including Lufthansa and Swissair.|$|E
500|$|Following the breakout, Middleton {{found himself}} in a doctrinally uncomfortable situation, as the allies were <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> to pursue the Germans. The {{cautious}} and methodical Middleton was in command of two infantry divisions and two armored divisions within his corps, and the impatient and audacious Patton could not understand why Middleton was not moving his armor quickly in pursuit. In early August Patton wrote in his diary, [...] "I cannot make out why Middleton was so apathetic or dumb. I don't know what was the matter with him." [...] Despite his wealth of battlefield experience and years of military schooling, Middleton had only limited experience in conducting pursuit operations, and was a bit overwhelmed by them. Ultimately he allowed his armored divisions some autonomy in their operations, while using his infantry to clean up pockets of resistance en route to Brest. His estimates of enemy strength turned out to be much more accurate than those provided to him by Patton, and Patton ultimately acknowledged Middleton's value as a corps commander by presenting him with a Distinguished Service Medal within seven weeks of calling him [...] "dumb" [...] in his diary.|$|E

While gaining leverage with Ralea, Herseni had lost backing from Constantinescu, who perceived him as a personal rival and, possibly, as a superior thinker, and worked to keep him away from sociological research.|$|E

2500|$|Drexler {{argues that}} {{we may need to}} wait until our {{conventional}} nanotechnology improves before solving these issues: [...] "Molecular manufacturing will result from a series of advances in molecular machine systems, much as the first Moon landing resulted from a series of advances in liquid-fuel rocket systems. We are <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> like that of the British Interplanetary Society of the 1930s which described how multistage liquid-fueled rockets could reach the Moon and pointed to early rockets as illustrations of the basic principle." [...] However, Freitas and Merkle argue [...] that a focused effort to achieve diamond mechanosynthesis (DMS) can begin now, using existing technology, and might achieve success in less than a decade if their [...] "direct-to-DMS approach is pursued rather than a more circuitous development approach that seeks to implement less efficacious nondiamondoid molecular manufacturing technologies before progressing to diamondoid".|$|E

They deployed considerable forces {{in their effort to}} catch her and so break the last remaining link with London. After 3 months, she was betrayed to the Gestapo and taken to their H.Q. in the Avenue Foch. The Gestapo had found her codes and messages and were <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> to work back to London. They asked her to co-operate, but she refused and gave them no information of any kind. She was imprisoned in one of the cells on the 5th floor of the Gestapo H.Q. and remained there for several weeks during which time she made two unsuccessful attempts at escape. She was asked to sign a declaration that she would make no further attempts, but she refused and the Chief of the Gestapo obtained permission from Berlin to send her to Germany for [...] "safe custody". She was the first agent to be sent to Germany.|$|E

2500|$|The Sherbs's second album, Defying Gravity, {{followed}} in 1981, {{but failed to}} produce a single that charted in the either the US or Australian top100. The band did, however, [...] chart on Billboards Rock Tracks Chart with the album cut [...] "We Ride Tonight" [...] peaking at No.26 in 1982. The track's mild AOR success {{was not enough to}} ignite album sales in the US, though, and Defying Gravity only reached No.202 on the album charts. A mini-album, Shaping Up, appeared in 1982. It was critically well received and spawned two minor hits in Australia, but the US issue missed the chart completely. The Sherbs were <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> where the US listening public were largely indifferent to their releases, and – despite their newer, more contemporary sound – the Australian audience had seemingly written them off as a relic of the 1970s. Porter has said that he found this especially frustrating, as he felt The Sherbs were actually writing and performing better material during this era than in their 1970s heyday.|$|E
2500|$|To {{handle the}} {{paramedic}} shortage, Deputy Mayor Paul Quander announced {{a major shift}} in DCFEMS hiring policy in mid-August. In the past, the city always hired paramedics who were also firefighters. Quander said that the city would now hire [...] "civilian" [...] paramedics—those who were not also trained as firefighters. Because of long-standing animosity between the firefighter and EMS divisions (which had different pay, fringe benefit, and scheduling differences), the city had a policy of hiring only firefighter-trained paramedics. [...] "Civilian" [...] paramedics were lost through attrition. However, DCFEMS gave no indication of when [...] "civilian" [...] paramedic hiring would begin, or how many it would hire. However, the Washington Post reported that the policy change allowed the city to hire 22 paramedics within just a few days, a 10 percent increase in staffing levels. The Associated Press, however, reported that just nine of the 22 would be working {{by the end of the}} year. Nonetheless, Ellerbe declared, [...] "Earlier this year, the department's ability to respond to emergency medical calls was at a tipping point. We're <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> to turn the corner".|$|E
2500|$|He was <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> {{to spend}} time {{composing}} works for which ideas had been germinating for years. [...] He interrupted his work on Les Béatitudes to produce (among many shorter works) the oratorio Rédemption (1871, revised 1874), the secular cantata Les Éolides (1876), the Trois Pièces for organ (1878), and the piano Quintet (1879). [...] Les Béatitudes itself finally saw its first performance in 1879. [...] As with many other premiers of Franck's larger choral and orchestral works, it was not successful: the work was highly sectionalized and lent itself to performance of excerpts {{rather than as a}} whole. [...] There was no orchestra available, and those sections that were performed were accompanied by piano. [...] Further, even d'Indy points out that Franck seemed incapable of musically expressing an evil contrasting to the virtues expressed in the Gospel beatitudes: [...] "This personification of ideal evil--if it is permissible to link these terms—was a conception so alien to Franck's nature that he never succeeded in giving it adequate expression." [...] The resulting [...] "impression of monotony", as Vallas puts it, caused even Franck's devoted pupils to speculate on Les Béatitudes viability as a single unified work.|$|E

2500|$|Coming Home {{garnered}} {{many positive}} reviews from music critics upon its release {{and has become}} widely {{regarded as one of}} the band's best releases. Praise often centered on the album's [...] "matured, nuanced songwriting" [...] and slower musicianship. Seen as a departure from their previous work, the songs have been described as the most [...] "mellow" [...] of New Found Glory's career, yet still employing [...] "the group's firmly established talent for writing strong melodies." [...] The Daily Trojan writer Nick Mindicino has asserted that while the album is often overlooked in the band's discography, it remains [...] "truly their best work." [...] AbsolutePunk founder Jason Tate paid compliment to the album's change in direction from earlier material, noting how [...] "the album hits us as the summer months fade and the air bends to the onslaught of fall. Incidentally, the band's musical thermometer is still intact. Instead of an album full of summer-fist-pumping-anthems they've released the perfect music by which to watch the leaves fall from the trees." [...] He went on to add that Coming Home [...] "certainly has the qualities that could make it a classic in time". Corey Apar of AllMusic awarded the album a four star rating and praised the [...] "at-ease spirit of Coming Home". He emphasised the new approach by adding, [...] "the band is <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> to simply enjoy itself without needing to forcibly shove saccharine-saturated hooks down the throats of anyone standing nearby. Make no mistake - this is a New Found Glory album through and through. It's full of melody, personality, and all the best attributes of their earlier work presented in a way that grows more memorable with each listen." [...] Brendan Manley of Alternative Press was unanimously positive and awarded a perfect five-star rating. He noted that the album [...] "extracts their finest qualities. Launching with the excellent [...] "Oxygen", Coming Home boasts stuttering rhythms, full-bodied guitars and gold plated vocal harmonies. NFG have made the best album of their career." [...] Paul Hagen of Big Cheese magazine awarded a four-star rating and commended the band's experimentation. He offered particular praise to the guitar work, of which he described as [...] "rousing and memorable." [...] He later summed up Coming Home as a [...] "creative, earnest and emotive" [...] record. Texas based newspaper, The Dallas Morning News also gave a favorable review and described the album as a [...] "sober, but happy record that recalls the band's formative days in sound and spirit." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson, critic for Entertainment Weekly, awarded the album a [...] "B" [...] grade and noted the maturity found amongst the songs; [...] "Like Green Day and Blink-182 before them, Florida-bred five-some New Found Glory has outgrown the bratty attitude that made them famous".|$|E
