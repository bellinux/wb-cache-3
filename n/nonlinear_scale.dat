Although this connection may appear superficial for a reader not familiar with differential equations, it is indeed the case that the main scale-space formulation in terms of non-enhancement of local extrema is expressed in terms of a sign condition on partial derivatives in the 2+1-D volume generated by the scale space, thus within the framework of partial differential equations. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the discrete case shows that the diffusion equation provides a unifying link between continuous and discrete scale spaces, which also generalizes to <b>nonlinear</b> <b>scale</b> spaces, for example, using anisotropic diffusion. Hence, one may say that the primary way to generate a scale space is by the diffusion equation, and that the Gaussian kernel arises as the Green's function of this specific partial differential equation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{introduce}} KAZE features, a novel multiscale 2 D {{feature detection}} and description algorithm in <b>nonlinear</b> <b>scale</b> spaces. Previous approaches detect and describe features at different scale levels by building or approximating the Gaussian scale space of an image. However, Gaussian blurring does not respect the natural boundaries {{of objects and}} smoothes {{to the same degree}} both details and noise, reducing localization accuracy and distinctiveness. In contrast, we detect and describe 2 D features in a <b>nonlinear</b> <b>scale</b> space by means of nonlinear diffusion filtering. In this way, we can make blurring locally adaptive to the image data, reducing noise but retaining object boundaries, obtaining superior localization accuracy and distinctiviness. The <b>nonlinear</b> <b>scale</b> space is built using efficient Additive Operator Splitting (AOS) techniques and variable conductance diffusion. We present an extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets and a practical matching application on deformable surfaces. Even though our features are somewhat more expensive to compute than SURF due to the construction of the <b>nonlinear</b> <b>scale</b> space, but comparable to SIFT, our results reveal a step forward in performance both in detection and description against previous state-of-the-art methods. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of pairwise, relative peculiar velocities, f(u;r), on small <b>nonlinear</b> <b>scales,</b> r, {{is derived from}} the Press [...] Schechter approach. This derivation assumes that Press [...] Schechter clumps are virialized and isothermal. The virialized assumption requires that the circular velocity, V_c ∝ M^ 1 / 3, where M denotes the mass of the clump. The isothermal assumption means that the circular velocity is independent of radius. Further, it is assumed that the velocity distribution within a clump is Maxwellian, that the pairwise relative velocity distribution is isotropic, and that on <b>nonlinear</b> <b>scales</b> clump-clump motions are unimportant when calculating the {{distribution of}} velocity differences. Comparison with N-body simulations shows that, on small <b>nonlinear</b> <b>scales,</b> all these assumptions are accurate. For most power spectra of interest, the resulting line of sight, pairwise, relative velocity distribution, f(u_ r), is well approximated by an exponential, rather than a Gaussian distribution. This simple Press [...] Schechter model is also able to provide a natural explanation for the observed, non-Maxwellian shape of f(v), the distribution of peculiar velocities.

This parameterisation applies to the $f(R) $ models and more generally to screened modified gravity models.

This allows us to estimate the matter density power spectrum and bispectrum from linear to highly <b>nonlinear</b> <b>scales,</b> the full probability distribution of the density contrast on weakly <b>nonlinear</b> <b>scales,</b> and the halo mass function.

We report a GPGPU implementation of the KAZE algorithm without resorting to binary descriptors for gaining speedup.

One way to achieve this is to model <b>nonlinear</b> <b>scales</b> perturbatively. Unfortunately, this involves high-dimensional loop integrals that are cumbersome to evaluate. Trying to simplify this, we show how two-loop (next-to-next-to-leading order) corrections to the density power spectrum can be reduced to low-dimensional, radial integrals. Many of those can be evaluated with a one-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform, which is significantly faster than the five-dimensional Monte-Carlo integrals that are needed otherwise. The general idea of this FFT-PT method is to switch between Fourier and position space to avoid convolutions and integrate over orientations, leaving only radial integrals. This reformulation is independent of the underlying shape of the initial linear density power spectrum and should easily accommodate features such as those from baryonic acoustic oscillations.
