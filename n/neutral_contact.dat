One hundred New Zealand based participants watched a video of actual online poker hands being played between a New Zealand (ingroup) and Russian (outgroup) player. Participants either saw positive, negative, or <b>neutral</b> <b>contact</b> occur between the players. Although there were no overall differences in outgroup attitudes, trust, or perceived group variability towards Russians, there was evidence of intergroup attitudes and trust when considering attitudes and trust toward Russians relative to New Zealanders.

40|$|Abstract. This paper takes metal-insulator-metal {{system as}} example and investigates the main types of {{electrical}} contact through {{the view of}} energy band structure, to analyze {{the whole process of}} the transition from ohm contact to barrier contact. Ohm contact, which promotes charges injection from electrode (metal) to insulator, can be used as storage of charge carrier, which is body limited; it can also be regarded as a type of contact that forms an accumulation layer extending from the interface to the interior of the insulator. Whereas, barrier contact is a type of contact which forms a depletion region extending from the interface to the interior of insulator. As for this type of contact, electron injection from metal tends to the state of saturation. The characteristic of <b>neutral</b> <b>contact</b> {{is that there is no}} space charge in the insulator, nor band bending, which means the boundary of conduction band and valence band up to the interface is flat...|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} design of a haptic {{computer}} accessory that adds the experience of touch to online conversations. It enables dyads to exchange the physical experience of holding hands regardless of distance and location. Text, speech and video communication systems support the transmission of several nonverbal affective aspects of communication but not the impression of physical proximity which is essential to experience a more intimate conversation. In real life touching hands is an important empathic experience for dyads that elicits a strong sense of togetherness, while signaling trust, understanding and social support. We analyzed hand-holding behavior of parent-child dyads and classified these into five categories implemented by the device: (1) child holding parent’s finger, (2) fingers on fingers (both on the inside), (3) palm on palm, (4) palm on outside of hand, and (5) child holding parent’s fingers and palm. For each hand holding position there are distinct sending, receiving and <b>neutral</b> <b>contact</b> points. Adding the haptic sensation of holding hands to online conversations may foster a sense of proximity or “togetherness”.

Methods: Data collected for 18 individuals using a 20 -s momentary time-sample from 08 : 00 to 19 : 00 {{over a number of}} days for each person were analysed. Duration of behaviours was compared when estimated from a 2 -h period between 16 : 00 and 18 : 00 and the period 08 : 00 - 16 : 00 and 18 : 00 - 19 : 00. Results: No significant differences at P < 0. 01 were found for engagement in meaningful activity, two-way interaction or 24 of the 26 behaviour codes used.

40|$|This {{research}} paper is about Armenian Diasporic paper "Vahagn" and Azerbaijan Diasporic paper "Ojag" published in Estonia in period 1989 - 1991. According to historical period - "perestroika" and Soviet Union's collapse – in new republics formed new Diasporas. Because {{of the new}} Diasporic status ethnic groups started own institutions inside the host-countries, established own media and tried to stay closer to Homeland {{and participate in the}} political process of independency that takes place in Homeland and host-country. Aim of this {{research paper}} is to see through the materials of those two papers how Diasporic media in Estonia understand and fulfil own role based on term of Minority Media role defined by Stephen Harold Riggins. Study is based on quantitative and qualitative content-analysis, where all articles published in defined period in both papers were studied. Present study focused on genre, subjects and source of articles. Study found out that both papers "Vahagn" and "Ojag" more or less fulfilled their role and actually turned to be not exactly Diasporic Media channel, but a small independent political newspaper in a context of their countries: Estonia (host-country) and predominated Homeland (Armenia or Azerbaijan). The Diasporic papers were the easiest way to avoid censorship that still occupied very strong positions in post-Soviet republics and to publish the materials that were suppress. Both Diasporic papers directed to Homeland a half of circulation with intention to bring "true information", revolutionary and agressive articls - opinions of people, who cannot express themselfs in Central Media. Author concluded that it is hard for Diasporas and their Media to stay away from political process that take place in their Homeland and focus only on Diaspora and its activity in host- country, keeping <b>neutral</b> <b>contact</b> to their Homeland without making the context politic and conflict...|$|E
40|$|This thesis applies {{principles}} of statistical physics and non-equilibrium dynamics to problems of scale, randomness, and growth in plant communities. It includes three projects related by their methodology and distinct {{in the nature}} of their applications. In the first project, we analyze the relationship between resource availability and species richness in community and regional level models of plant/tree communities. At local scales, vegetative communities tend to follow a unimodal relationship between resources and species richness. However, as per the results of species-energy theory, they tend to obey a monotonically increasing relationship at large scales. We use a multi-species <b>neutral</b> <b>contact</b> process coupled to a heterogeneous resource landscape to explain the scale-dependent transition. We find that the unimodal curve at the community scale may be understood as a tradeoff between colonization of and competition for limited resources. We then construct statistical aggregates of community level ecosystems and find two necessary conditions for a scale-dependent transition: (i) the spatial distribution of resources is highly correlated and (ii) the extent of species pools increases in regions with higher overall resources. The second project integrates the analysis of size-structured populations into the study of the contact process. We introduce the contact process with ontogeny to describe the growth and spread of organisms with size-structured juvenile and adult stages. We derive a mean field theory of the contact process with ontogeny, which we solve yielding an additional oscillatory phase. The mean field phase diagram is found in terms of A, the dimensionless reproductive rate, and 0, the dimensionless growth rate. (cont.) However, the oscillatory phase is not borne out in explicitly spatial Monte Carlo simulations, in contrast to the regularity with which oscillations are observed for well-stirred models of size-structured populations. Instead we find a "corralled" phase where the growth of new seeds interfere with one another, limiting basal area and number of adults, and leading to a unimodal relationship between density p and reproductive rate A. We analyze the onset of the corralled phase by analyzing spatial correlations and find that this self-limiting phase is characterized by distinct peaks in the radial distribution function. We also determine the universality class of the transition between life and death and point out where generalizations of the model may be applied to plant/tree communities. The final project addresses the size distributions of systems where growth is limited by geometric constraints. We develop a model termed packing limited growth (PLG) which describes the interaction and growth of sessile organisms. We show that a class of models previously introduced in the context of growth and nucleation kinetics may be mapped onto PLG. We develop a scaling theory which connects the fractal dimension of packings to the approach to the fully packed state. The equilibrium size distribution of PLG models is shown to depend on dimensionality, anisotropy, and geometric shape. Numerical estimates of fractal dimensions are calculated in d = 2, 3, and 4. by Joshua Stephen Weitz. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Physics, 2003.
