5|$|After Theophrastus, though {{interest}} in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly. It is {{not until the}} age of Alexandria under the Ptolemies that advances in biology resumed. The first medical teacher at Alexandria, Herophilus of Chalcedon, corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries, <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> latter pulse while the former do not.|$|E

5|$|However, other taxonomists {{challenged}} {{the validity of}} the species as early as 1939, <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Lānai hookbill was only known from one specimen and arguing that it was merely an aberrant and partially albino female ōū. The hookbill's validity was not confirmed until 1989 when the specimen's skull was removed and examined. The bird's cranial osteology, myology, plumage, and bill morphology confirmed the distinctness of the species.|$|E

5|$|In 1985 {{biochemist}} David Dolphin {{proposed a}} link between the rare blood disorder porphyria and vampire folklore. <b>Noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> condition is treated by intravenous haem, he suggested that the consumption of large amounts of blood may result in haem being transported somehow across the stomach wall and into the bloodstream. Thus vampires were merely sufferers of porphyria seeking to replace haem and alleviate their symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Initially the Augusta National Invitational {{field was}} {{composed}} of Bobby Jones' close associates. Jones had petitioned the USGA to hold the U.S. Open at Augusta but the USGA denied the petition, <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hot Georgia summers would create difficult playing conditions.|$|E

5|$|Capaldi's actions {{received}} favourable {{coverage from}} the Autism Daily Newscast, an official Google News website reporting on current events and news {{of interest to}} those on the autism spectrum, with site journalist Jo Worgan <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> actor had devoted himself while {{on the set of}} Doctor Who to spending time with an autistic girl who was a fan of the show.

5|$|Elton {{does not}} believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, {{pointing}} out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of specific information about the battle—no-one even knows exactly where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.|$|E
5|$|Following {{several years}} of {{relative}} inactivity as the band maintained their relaxed touring pace, Perry began writing material for a new Daddies album in early 2006, claiming to {{have come to the}} realization of a cathartic reliance on songwriting. In an April 2006 radio interview, he confirmed that the band was in preparation over recording a new studio album, <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> music would cover new territory for the Daddies, drawing heavily on tropical themes. This was followed shortly thereafter by the band's first U.S. tour since 2000, where much of this new material was debuted.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, the {{astronomer}} Giuseppe Piazzi discovered an object which he initially {{believed to be}} a comet. Shortly thereafter he announced his observations of this object, <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> slow, uniform motion was uncharacteristic of a comet, suggesting it was a different type of object. This was lost from sight for several months, but was recovered later that year by the Baron von Zach and Heinrich W. M. Olbers after a preliminary orbit was computed by Carl Friedrich Gauss. This object came to be named Ceres, and was the first asteroid to be discovered.|$|E

5|$|In September 2013, Mayor Rahm Emanuel {{terminated}} {{negotiations to}} privatize the airport, <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> process {{was no longer}} competitive {{after one of the}} two finalists had backed out. The one remaining was Great Lakes Airport Alliance – a partnership of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets and Ferrovial. Macquarie was one of the investors in the Chicago Skyway. The group that had backed out was a group that included the Australia-based Industry Funds Management and Manchester Airports Group. The Great Lakes proposal had been valued at $2 billion and would have involved a 40-year lease.|$|E
5|$|Mihardja {{later wrote}} that he {{intended}} the novel {{to deal with the}} question of the existence of God. Mahayana et al. agree, <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> theme of faith– a theme unknown in modern Indonesian literature at the time– is found throughout the novel. Maier notes that the psychological concepts of guilt, fear, and remorse drive the novel. Teeuw describes the work as taking up the classic theme of modernity versus tradition in a new, more worldly manner. Balfas writes that this approach to the theme was soon followed by other writers.|$|E
5|$|On 25 July, Visscher's {{replacement}} Abraham Roos—sent in late June because Visscher {{was considered}} mentally unstable—arrived in Semarang with 170 men, <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> company only controlled the fortress, European quarters and beachhead. After Roos' arrival, the Dutch government began sending more reinforcements, eventually totalling at least 1,400 Dutch and 1,600 Indonesian soldiers. By November 1741, the company's fortress in Semarang {{was surrounded by}} 3,500 Chinese and 20,000 Javanese troops, who were armed with 30 cannons, as opposed to 3,400 Dutch and loyalist troops. With the superior Dutch firepower and tactics causing 's troops to scatter, the siege was eventually broken and an expedition was able to reclaim Jepara.|$|E

50|$|The verse {{is careful}} to <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> persecuted are blessed only when they are reproached and slandered falsely.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} project {{received}} the {{cease and desist}} letter, an alpha version of the patch was leaked on the internet. ZeaLitY expressed his disapproval and embarrassment on the Crimson Echoes website, <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> alpha version was extremely buggy and lacked many of the improvements made in the beta version. In January 2011, a more complete beta version was leaked which could be played from beginning to end, {{believed to be the}} final build of the project prior to cancellation.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Kellogg's Grove, {{like many}} of the battles and skirmishes during the Black Hawk War, had no real order or strategy. Early sources {{indicated}} that the battle was a complete victory for the state militia, declaring the battle a rout and <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Sauk lost 15 while the militia only suffered 5 men killed. Conversely, according to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, the result, essentially, was that the band of approximately 50 Sauk warriors routed the 300 or so ill-disciplined white troops.|$|E
5|$|The Flames were {{inundated}} with complaints from season ticket holders upset by their seat assignments {{and the cost}} of tickets. King responded to the concerns by <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> league had purchased the game from the Flames, and the team was given a limited allotment of seats for its ticket holders. He also noted that it was possible that the event would lose money, even at ticket prices ranging between $49 and $249, but that the team brought the Heritage Classic to Calgary because the fans wanted the game to return to Canada. The Pittsburgh Penguins and Buffalo Sabres encountered similar issues allocating tickets for the Winter Classic.|$|E
