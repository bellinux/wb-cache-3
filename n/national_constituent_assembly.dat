5|$|Citizens in {{the south}} were opposed to a {{centralised}} government, and to the decrees of its rule, which resulted in rebellion. Prior to the revolution France had been divided into provinces with local governments. In 1790 the government, the <b>National</b> <b>Constituent</b> <b>Assembly,</b> reorganised France into administrative departments in order to rebalance the uneven distribution of French wealth, which had been subject to feudalism under the monarchical Ancien Régime.|$|E
5|$|After {{involving}} {{itself in}} the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War, France found itself financially ruined. Attempts to pass an economic plan to alleviate this in the Estates-General of 1789 led instead to the third estate—the commoners—forking to form the National Assembly. Succeeded in turn by the <b>National</b> <b>Constituent</b> <b>Assembly</b> and the Legislative Assembly, the various legislative bodies succeeded in rendering the monarchy constitutional, limited by democratic institutions. Attempts to remove the monarch entirely, although thwarted on 20 June 1792, led to the effective overthrow of Louis XVI on 10 August. On 21 October, France was formally declared a republic.|$|E
5|$|Provence {{urged the}} king to act {{strongly}} against the declaration, while the king's popular minister Jacques Necker intended to {{compromise with the}} new assembly. Louis XVI was characteristically indecisive. On 9 July, the assembly declared itself a <b>National</b> <b>Constituent</b> <b>Assembly</b> that would give France a Constitution. On 11 July, Louis XVI dismissed Necker, which led to widespread rioting across Paris. On 12 July, the sabre charge of the cavalry regiment of Charles-Eugène de Lorraine, prince de Lambesc, on a crowd gathered at the Tuileries gardens, sparked the Storming of the Bastille two days later.|$|E
50|$|In Elected to the States-General for the Third Estate in Douai, {{he was one}} of {{the chief}} of those who applied the {{principles}} of liberty and equality embodied in the <b>National</b> <b>Constituent</b> <b>Assembly's</b> Tennis Court Oath of 4 August 1789.|$|R
50|$|Delegated to the {{provisional}} consultive assembly, {{he was then}} appointed to the two <b>national</b> <b>constituent</b> <b>assemblies</b> {{as a member of}} the French Communist Party, then to the French National Assembly from 1946. He was constantly re-elected in Allier until 1978 (except during the 1962 - 1967 term when his seat was occupied by the socialist Charles Magne, mayor of Gannat). He was also an active member of the Peace Movement.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the liberation (August 1944), he was elected to be a {{delegate}} for Seine-et-Marne to two <b>national</b> <b>constituent</b> <b>assemblies</b> and then to the National Assembly of France itself, a position he held {{for the duration of the}} French Fourth Republic (1946-1958). He was Minister for Veterans and War Victims in the provisional governments of Félix Gouin and Georges Bidault from 26 January to 8 July 1946.|$|R
5|$|The {{rest of the}} <b>National</b> <b>Constituent</b> <b>Assembly</b> {{followed}} the king within two weeks to new quarters in Paris. In short order, the entire body settled {{in only a few}} steps from the Tuileries at a former riding school, the Salle du Manège. However, some fifty-six monarchien deputies did not come with them, believing the mob threat in the capital to be personally dangerous. The October journées thus effectively deprived the monarchist faction of significant representation in the Assembly as most of these deputies retreated from the political scene; many, like Mounier, fled the country altogether.|$|E
5|$|Blérancourt's {{traditional}} {{power structure}} was reshaped {{by the events}} of 1789. The notary Gellé, previously an undisputed town leader, was challenged by a group of reformists who were led by several of Saint-Just's friends, including the husband of his sister Louise. Their attempts were not successful until 1790 when Blérancourt held its first open municipal elections. Mandated by the <b>National</b> <b>Constituent</b> <b>Assembly,</b> the new electoral structure allowed Saint-Just's friends to assume authority in the village as mayor, secretary, and, in the case of his brother-in-law, head of the local National Guard. The jobless Saint-Just, despite not meeting the legal age and tax qualifications, was allowed to join the Guard.|$|E
5|$|In 1789, the bailliage (bailiwick) of Metz elected Custine to the Estates-General; {{upon his}} election, he {{resigned}} his military commission, judging that his responsibilities {{in the national}} assembly required his full attention. In July 1789, as the French Revolution gained momentum, he remained in the <b>National</b> <b>Constituent</b> <b>Assembly.</b> There, he supported {{the creation of a}} constitution espousing the principles of representative government and often voted with such liberal (constitutional) nobility as the Marquis de Lafayette. Although he supported the abolition of some seigniorial rights, he strongly defended royal prerogative and the rights of the nobility who fled during the Great Fear, especially their rights of property. He offered limited support of the nineteen decrees that abolished game-laws, seigniorial courts, the purchase and sale of posts in the magistracy, pecuniary immunities, favoritism in taxation, surplice money, first-fruits, pluralities, and unmerited pensions.|$|E
5000|$|As the French Revolution progressed, {{he became}} alarmed at the {{increase}} of the <b>National</b> <b>Constituent</b> <b>Assembly's</b> power {{at the expense of}} the King's royal authority. He became a special object of popular hatred when he was alleged to have replied to women begging for bread: [...] "You had enough while you had only one king; demand bread of your twelve hundred sovereigns". Nevertheless, he held office until January 1791.|$|R

25|$|When {{the war was}} over, {{following}} de Gaulle's entourage's {{advice and}} the approbation of the archbishop of Paris, Abbé Pierre was elected deputy for Meurthe-et-Moselle department in both <b>National</b> <b>Constituent</b> <b>Assemblies</b> in 1945–1946 as an independent close to the Popular Republican Movement (MRP), mainly consisting of Christian democratic members of the Resistance. In 1946, he was re-elected {{as a member of}} the National Assembly, but this time {{as a member of the}} MRP. Abbé Pierre became vice-president of the Confédération mondiale in 1947, a universal federalist movement.|$|R
5|$|The king's {{court and}} the deputies of the <b>National</b> <b>Constituent</b> <b>Assembly</b> were all in {{comfortable}} residence at the royal city of Versailles, where they were considering momentous changes to the French political system. Reformist deputies had managed to pass sweeping legislation {{in the weeks after}} the Bastille's fall, including the revolutionary August Decrees (which formally abolished most noble and clerical privileges) and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. Now their attention was turned {{to the creation of a}} permanent constitution. Monarchists and conservatives of all degrees had thus far been unable to resist the surging strength of the reformers, but by September their positions were beginning, however slightly, to improve. In constitutional negotiations they were able to secure a legislative veto power for the king. Many of the reformers were left aghast by this, and further negotiations were hobbled by contentiousness.|$|E

5000|$|Locke {{is known}} for his {{statement}} that individuals have a right to [...] "Life, Liberty and Property", and his belief that the natural right to property is derived from labor. Tutored by Locke, Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury wrote in 1706: [...] "There is a mighty Light which spreads its self over the world especially in those two free Nations of England and Holland; on whom the Affairs of Europe now turn". Locke's theory of natural rights has influenced many political documents, including the United States Declaration of Independence and the French <b>National</b> <b>Constituent</b> <b>Assembly's</b> Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.|$|R
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the French Revolution in 1789, Latouche-Tréville was elected deputy of the Nobility for the bailiwick of Montargis; he went on to sit at the <b>National</b> <b>Constituent</b> <b>Assembly</b> and held this position until it adjourned on 10 October 1791. Latouche took a liberal posture and was among the first nobles to join forces with the Third Estate. In September 1791, after king Louis XVI approved the new constitution, the <b>National</b> <b>Constituent</b> <b>Assembly</b> disbanded, and Latouche-Tréville resumed his naval activities.|$|E

5000|$|The {{remaining}} {{candidates that}} were {{submitted by the}} <b>National</b> <b>Constituent</b> <b>Assembly's</b> elders to the TSC were rejected for failing to meet specific criteria agreed upon by stakeholders that partook in earlier agreements, including the Galkayo and Garowe Principles accords.
