The corellas were {{given the opportunity to}} exchange a favoured food item (in this case a pecan <b>nut)</b> <b>for</b> an even more desirable nut (a cashew), if they were only able to hold the first <b>nut</b> <b>for</b> a period of time and then return it to the human researcher's hand uneaten - at which point the nuts would be exchanged. Although pecan nuts are normally consumed instantly, it was discovered that the corellas could resist the temptation to eat the <b>nut</b> <b>for</b> periods of time for up to 80 seconds once aware that a cashew was also on offer. This behaviour (having also previously been demonstrated in corvids) further disproves the previous belief that birds are incapable of self-control.|$|R
