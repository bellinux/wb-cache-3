50|$|Wheel speed {{transducers}} in each {{main wheel}} axle induce an AC frequency on the DC voltage input proportionate to the wheel speed as they are driven by the wheels. This frequency is compared to a <b>normal</b> <b>deceleration</b> curve and if it deviates it activates a small torque motor in the affected wheel control valve which shunts braking pressure to the return line {{by means of a}} spool valve. As the wheel rotation speed accelerates to normal tolerance limits, normal braking pressure is restored.|$|E
30|$|Authors {{observed}} that in staggered driving conditions, the headways {{can be much}} lower than that required for a <b>normal</b> <b>deceleration</b> process. This suggests that drivers often keep a minimum gap considering maximum deceleration capabilities of vehicles while following. Also, as the subject vehicle’s speed would be limited by safe gap (braking rule), the erratic deceleration behaviour of conventional CA models is avoided. This increases {{the scope of the}} model as it can now simulate sudden braking of the leader vehicle without causing collision or unrealistic deceleration of the subject vehicle.|$|E
40|$|A brake {{which is}} {{designed}} to provide a limited proportion of the total braking force at <b>normal</b> <b>decelerations</b> may be able to brake the car at high decelerations but may suffer damage when used for emergency braking. A conventional braking system uses 100 % of friction braking to retard a moving car while with regenerative braking the friction brakes will supply less than 100 %. This paper starts to establish the working limitations of lightweight brakes for regenerative braking in extreme deceleration. Thermo-mechanical analysis can be used to predict the temperature profile on disc surfaces and analytical and experimental methods can be used to predict the thermal braking performance to calculate temperature rises under emergency braking conditions and brake cooling. The aim is to establish an analytical and experimental procedure to design a lightweight disc rotor for general use at high duty levels...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{assess the}} {{relations}} between early filling deceleration time, left ventricular remodelling, and cardiac mortality in an unselected group of postinfarction patients.  DESIGN AND PATIENTS—Prospective evaluation of 131  consecutive patients with first acute myocardial infarction. Echocardiography was performed on day 1, day 2, day 3, day 7, at three and six weeks, and at three, six, and 12  months after infarction. According to deceleration time on day 1, patients were divided into groups with short (< 150  ms) and <b>normal</b> <b>deceleration</b> time (⩾  150 ms).  SETTING—Tertiary care centre.  RESULTS—Patients with a short deceleration time had higher end systolic and end diastolic volume indices and a higher wall motion score index, but a lower ejection fraction, in the year after infarction. These patients also showed {{a significant increase in}} end diastolic (p <  0. 001) and end systolic volume indices (p =  0. 007) during the follow up period, while ejection fraction and wall motion score index remained unchanged. In the group with <b>normal</b> <b>deceleration</b> time, end diastolic volume index increased (p <  0. 001) but end systolic volume index did not change; in addition, the ejection fraction increased (p =  0. 002) and the wall motion score index decreased (p <  0. 001). One year and five year survival analysis showed greater cardiac mortality in patients with a short deceleration time (p =  0. 04 and p =  0. 02, respectively). In a Cox model, which included initial ejection fraction, infarct location, and infarct size, deceleration time on day 1  was the only significant predictor of five year mortality.  CONCLUSIONS—A short deceleration time on day 1  after acute myocardial infarction can identify patients who are likely to undergo left ventricular remodelling in the following year. These patients have a higher one year and five year cardiac mortality.    Keywords: deceleration time; left ventricular remodelling; acute myocardial infarctio...|$|E

It is based on specific oligonucleotides used as starting segments (primers) of {{both sides of the}} genomic region to be studied. This chain reaction is characterized by three steps: denaturation of DNA by increasing the temperature; renaturation of the DNA allowing for competition between the two original DNA segments and the numerous primers, and finally synthesis of DNA by the polymerase. The cycle is repeated from 25 to 35 times in order to exponentially duplicate the DNA-fragments between the two primers. Usage of a thermoresistant polymerase permitted automatization of the procedure. This technique represents a revolution for practical molecular biology and medicine. Its very high sensitivity, however, may cause errors that have to be recognized. Several practical examples are described and analyzed in order to illustrate the PCR-concept to physicians in practise...|$|E
40|$|The {{transverse}} motion inside a Stark decelerator plays {{a large role}} in the total efficiency of deceleration. We differentiate between two separate regimes of molecule loss during the slowing process. The first mechanism involves distributed loss due to coupling of transverse and longitudinal motion, while the second {{is a result of the}} rapid decrease of the molecular velocity within the final few stages. In this work, we describe these effects and present means for overcoming them. Solutions based on modified switching time sequences with the existing decelerator geometry lead to a large gain of stable molecules in the intermediate velocity regime, but fail to address the loss at very low final velocities. We propose a new decelerator design, the quadrupole-guiding decelerator, which eliminates distributed loss due to transverse/longitudinal couplings throughout the slowing process and also exhibits gain over <b>normal</b> <b>deceleration</b> to the lowest velocities.

40|$|Abstract: This paper mainly {{focuses on}} {{integrated}} {{control of the}} brake system of a hybrid electric vehicle, i. e. the integration of friction braking and regenerative braking during anti-lock braking control and series brake blending during <b>normal</b> <b>deceleration.</b> Based on a series regenerative braking system, the structure of an integrated brake system is proposed. The models of each part of a hybrid electric bus are built in MATLAB–Simulink, taking authorized articles as references.

The integrated control strategy is proposed {{on the basis of a}} pneumatic anti-lock braking strategy. Simulation results show that the participation of regenerative braking in the anti-lock braking control can be beneficial to both the ride comfort and the braking performance of the vehicle.

40|$|Fine {{particulate}} matter from traffic increases mortality and morbidity. An {{important source of}} traffic particles is brake wear. American studies reported cars to emit break wear particles {{at a rate of}} about 11 mg/km to 20 mg/km of driven distance. A German study estimated that break wear contributes about 12. 5 % to 21 % of the total traffic particle emissions. The goal of this study was to build a system that allows the study of brake wear particle emissions during different braking behaviours of different car and brake types. The particles should be characterize in terms of size, number, metal, and elemental and organic carbon composition. In addition, the influence of different deceleration schemes on the particle composition and size distribution should be studied. Finally, this system should allow exposing human cell cultures to these particles. An exposure-box (0. 25 cubic-m volume) was built that can be mounted around a car's braking system. This allows exposing cells to fresh brake wear particles. Concentrations of particle numbers, mass and surface, metals, and carbon compounds were quantified. Tests were conducted with A 549 lung epithelial cells. Five different cars and two typical braking behaviours (full stop and <b>normal</b> <b>deceleration)</b> were tested. Particle number and size distribution was analysed for the first six minutes. In this time, two braking events occurred. Full stop produced significantly higher particle concentrations than <b>normal</b> <b>deceleration</b> (average of 23 ' 000 vs. 10 ' 400 #/cm 3, p= 0. 016). The particle number distribution was bi-modal with one peak at 60 to 100 nm (depending on the tested car and braking behaviour) and a second peak at 200 to 400 nm. Metal concentrations varied depending on the tested car type. Iron (range of 163 to 15 ' 600 μg/m 3) and Manganese (range of 0. 9 to 135 μg/m 3) were present in all samples, while Copper was absent in some samples (< 6 to 1220 μg/m 3). The overall "fleet" metal ratio was Fe:Cu:Mn = 128 : 14 : 1. Temperature and humidity varied little. A 549 -cells were successfully exposed in the various experimental settings and retained their viability. Culture supernatant was stored and cell culture samples were fixated to test for inflammatory response. Analysis of these samples is ongoing. The established system allowed testing brake wear particle emissions from real-world cars. The large variability of chemical composition and emitted amounts of brake wear particles between car models seems to be related to differences between brake pad compositions of different producers. Initial results suggest that the conditions inside the exposure box allow exposing human lung epithelial cells to freshly produced brake wear particles...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} communication (Hall-Craggs 1968) {{the results of}} experimental epiphysiodesis of {{the upper and lower}} ends of the rabbit tibia were reported. It was found that when growth in length at either the proximal or distal extremity of the bone was restricted by epiphysiodesis a reduction in the <b>normal</b> <b>deceleration</b> of growth rate occurred at the opposite end. As a result the undamaged epiphysis contributed a greater amount to the final length of the bone than the corresponding epiphysis of the other limb of the animal. These findings, together with the fact that no change in foot length was observed in the experimental limb, suggested that the phenomenon was limited to the experimental bone, and that it provided evidence of a local growth-controlling system. Although the additional contribution made by the uninjured epiphysis was never sufficient to compensate for the loss which followed epiphysiodesis, there was reasonable evidence to suggest that the degree of failure of the injured epiphysis to grow was directly related to the additional contribution {{at the other end of}} the bone. As each experimental bone was submitted to the same degree of trauma whatever the success of the epiphysiodesis, it was also argued that the trauma per se was not responsible for the increase in growth. However, one sequel to the epiphysiodesi...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To examine left {{ventricular}} function after surgical resection of subaortic stenosis during childhood. DESIGN [...] Left ventricular performance was measured non-invasively in all patients {{who responded to}} an invitation for formal assessment. SETTING [...] Outpatient study, tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS [...] Twenty three (12 male and 11 female) patients (age range 3 to 31 years) of 43 consecutive patients with fixed subaortic stenosis undergoing surgical resection between 1975 and 1989 reattended for formal assessment 16 months to 15 years (median 4 years 4 months) after operation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Left ventricular dimension, {{left ventricular}} wall thickness, left ventricular Doppler inflow velocities, and left ventricular diastolic pressure (measured from apexcardiograms). Results were compared with those in controls individually matched for age and sex. RESULTS [...] All patients were symptom free. Left ventricular cavity dimensions were normal, as was the mean fractional shortening. Posterior wall thickness tended to be greater in the patients {{and there was a}} significant increase in septal thickness. Normalised peak rate of posterior wall thinning was significantly lower in the patients and the isovolumic relaxation time was significantly shorter. Doppler inflow velocity measurements showed that early diastolic mitral flow acceleration time was <b>normal</b> but <b>deceleration</b> time was significantly shorter in the patients. The ratio of mitral flow in early diastole (E) to E plus mitral flow in late diastole (A) was significantly higher in the patients and in two patients there was complete absence of A wave flow despite large A waves on the apexcardiogram. CONCLUSIONS [...] Systolic function was well preserved in patients after operation for subaortic stenosis. A restrictive pattern of left ventricular filling was common, however, and presumably reflected a response to the chronic pressure load and to surgery in the paediatric heart...|$|R
40|$|Powered {{models of}} three {{different}} flying boats were landed in oncoming wave of various heights and lengths. The resulting motions and acceleration were recorded to survey the effects of varying the trim at landing, the deceleration after landing, {{and the size of}} the waves. One of the models had an unusually long afterbody. The data for landing with <b>normal</b> rates of <b>deceleration</b> indicated that the most severe motions and accelerations were likely to occur at some period of the landing run subsequent to the initial impact. Landings made at abnormally low trims led to unusually severe bounces during the runout. The least severe landing occurred after a small lending when the model was rapidly decelerated at about 0. 4 g in a simulation of the proposed use of braking devices. The severity of the landings increased with wave height and was at a maximum when the wave length was of the order of from one and one-half to twice the over-all length of the model. The models with afterbodies of moderate length frequently bounced clear of the water into a stalled attitude at speeds below flying speed. The model with the long afterbody had less tendency to bounce from the waves and consequently showed less severe accelerations during the landing run than the models with moderate lengths of afterbody...|$|R

We tested {{the effects of}} A-V delay modification on Doppler derived filling pattern in 7 hypertensive patients (pts) who implanted DDD pacemaker (Cosmos II Intermedicsl for Sick Sinus Syndrome (SSS). All had normal ejection fraction (64 ± 6 %), but abnormal filling pattern (at nominal values of 200 msec) due either to left ventricular hypertrophy and electrically induced left bundle branch block. This group was compared with a similar one of 7 pts (group 21 with DDD-PM for SSS but <b>normal</b> filling pattern. (<b>Deceleration</b> time Group 1 = 302. 86 ± 42, Group 2 = 212. 86 ± 17. 04 p= 0. 01). Group 1 normalized filling pattern reducing Dec t and A peak increasing E peak velocity at 100 msec A-V delay, with less modification at 75 and 150 msec, whereas group 1 showed umpredictable modification. DDD pacing of pts with abnormal filling presented a “normalised pattern”, at 100 A-V delay probably due to increased atrial pressure resulting from anticipation of ventricular spike, which avoids complete atrial relaxation and makes mitral valve to open earlier. It seems that DDD pacing of pts with LV hypertrophy, abnormal relaxation and normal performance needs of short A-V delay to improve filling, whereas pts with normal filling at nominal values, do not...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare postures of male and female vehicle occupants, tested in both front seat positions, during <b>normal</b> driving and <b>deceleration</b> onset. These data are useful for the {{development}} and initialisation of computational human body models. A secondary aim was to examine the effect of reversible, motorised seat belts in these events. Kinematics were analysed for volunteers driving on rural roads, prior to autonomous braking (11 m/s 2 deceleration). Two restraint configurations were tested: a standard versus a motorized belt, activated 200 ms before braking initiation. Kinematic metric comparison via ANCOVA was performed to understand postural differences across gender, role (driver/passenger), and belt type (standard/motorised). Data was analysed prior to and at vehicle deceleration, termed typical riding and initial braking, respectively. While males and females displayed similar postures during typical riding, differences existed between drivers and passengers, especially with respect to neck posture. Drivers displayed more protracted neck postures, with significantly smaller (by 22 ‐ 27 mm, depending on gender) head‐to‐sternum horizontal distances, than passengers. Motorised belts significantly changed posture during initial braking, notably of the chest (which was shifted posteriorly by approximately 13 mm, depending on gender and role), while standard belts did not. Within a given belt type, occupants’ change in posture was similar across gender and role during initial braking...|$|R
40|$|Comets {{have long}} been {{proposed}} as a potential means for the transport of complex organic compounds to early Earth. For {{this to be a}} viable mechanism, a significant fraction of organic compounds must survive the high temperatures due to impact. We have undertaken three-dimensional numerical simulations to track the thermodynamic state of a comet during oblique impacts. The comet was modeled as a 1 -km water-ice sphere impacting a basalt plane at 11. 2 km/s; impact angles of 15 {sup o} (from horizontal), 30 {sup o}, 45 {sup o}, 65 {sup o}, and 90 {sup o} (normal impact) were examined. The survival of organic cometary material, modeled as water ice for simplicity, was calculated using three criteria: (1) peak temperatures, (2) the thermodynamic phase of H{sub 2 }O, and (3) final temperature upon isentropic unloading. For impact angles {{greater than or equal to}} 30 {sup o}, no organic material is expected to survive the impact. For the 15 {sup o} impact, most of the material survives the initial impact and significant fractions (55 %, 25 %, and 44 %, respectively) satisfy each survival criterion at 1 second. Heating due to deceleration, in addition to shock heating, plays a role in the heating of the cometary material for nonnormal impacts. This effect is more noticeable for more oblique impacts, resulting in significant deviations from estimates using scaling of <b>normal</b> impacts. The <b>deceleration</b> heating of the material at late times requires further modeling of breakup and mixing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—With {{the growing}} concern for driving safety, many driving-assistance {{systems have been}} developed. In this paper, we develop a reasoning-based {{framework}} for the monitoring of driving safety. The main objective is to present drivers with an intuitively understood green/yellow/red indicator of their danger level. Because the danger level may change owing to {{the interaction of the}} host vehicle and the environment, the proposed framework involves two stages of danger-level alerts. The first stage collects lane bias, the distance to the front car, longitudinal and lateral accelerations, and speed data from sensors installed in a real vehicle. All data were recorded in a normal driving environment for the training of hidden Markov models of driving events, including <b>normal</b> driving, acceleration, <b>deceleration,</b> changing to the left or right lanes, zigzag driving, and approaching the car in front. In addition to recognizing these driving events, the degree of each event is estimated according to its character. In the second stage, the danger-level indicator, which warns the driver of a dangerous situation, is inferred by fuzzy logic rules that address the recognized driving events and their degrees. A hierarchical decision strategy is also designed {{to reduce the number of}} rules that are triggered. The proposed framework was successfully implemented on a TI DM 3730 -based embedded platform and was fully evaluated in a real road environment. The experimental results achieved a detection ratio of 99 % for event recognition, compared with that achieved by four conventional methods.
