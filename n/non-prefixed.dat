40|$|A letter-search {{task was}} used to test the {{hypothesis}} that affixes are chunked during morphological processing and that such chunking might operate differently for prefixes and suffixes. Participants had to detect a letter target that was embedded either in a prefix or suffix (e. g., ‘R’ in propoint or filmure) or in a <b>non-prefix</b> beginning or non-suffix ending (e. g., ‘R’ in cropoint or filmire). Prefixed and suffixed letter-strings comprised real stems and affixes but never formed a real word. Effects of letter cluster frequency were also investigated by manipulating the frequency of non-affix beginnings and endings. Letter search took longer in suffixes compared with non-suffix endings but not for prefixes compared with <b>non-prefix</b> beginnings. Moreover, performance was not affected by letter cluster frequency. We interpret our findings in the light of recent accounts of morpho-orthographic segmentation and the different function of prefixes and suffixes. 14 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Mapping ontologies is {{a crucial}} process when facilitating system {{interoperability}} and information ex-change. Ontology Mapping systems commonly utilize string metrics in the mapping process to compare concept names. String metrics can be extended using the Winkler method, which increases the similarity value of two strings if these have a common prefix. A common occurrence for two corresponding ontology concepts is that {{the name of the}} first concept is a <b>non-prefix</b> sub-string of the name of the second concept. The Winkler extension does not allocate a higher similarity value to these pairs of strings, however intu-itively this indicates that the two names have a similar meaning. This paper proposes a generalization of the Winkler extension, such that pairs of names with large common <b>non-prefix</b> sub-strings receive a higher similarity value as well. The proposed metric is evaluated on a record-matching dataset and a dataset from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative. The experiments reveal that metrics applying our proposed generalization outperform the same metrics when applying the Winkler extension. ...|$|R

Optimal third-order coding rates are derived for general fixed-to-variable codes and for prefix codes.

40|$|Recently, we have {{proposed}} two complementary approaches, top-down and bottom-up, to multilevel supervisory control of discrete-event systems. In this paper, we compare and combine these approaches. The combined approach has strong features of both approaches, namely, a lower {{complexity of the}} top-down approach with the generality of the bottom-up approach. We show that, for prefix-closed languages, a posteriori supervisors computed in the bottom-up manner do not alter maximal permissiveness within the three-level coordination control architecture, that is, the supremal three-level conditionally-controllable and conditionally-normal language can always be computed in a distributed way using multilevel coordination. Moreover, a general polynomial-time procedure for <b>non-prefix</b> closed case is proposed based on coordinators for nonblockingness and a posteriori supervisors...|$|R
40|$|The work {{is based}} on a novel {{approach}} of associating verbs with various affixes on the basis of similar meanings. Using electronic sources data, the thesis paper captures the system of verbal derivatives of the -pad- radix in 53 entries that comprise their dictionary definition, an analysis of characteristic valence structures and, above all, a large number of examples. More than thousand various records extracted from the Czech National Corpus and the internet may be found in this paper. Verbs with the -pad- radix exist in three aspectual forms - as -nou- suffix perfectives, -a- suffix imperfectives, and -va- suffix secondary imperfectives. Moreover, these forms form combinations with 14 various prefixes (in addition to <b>non-prefix</b> forms and povy- and zprodouble- prefix forms) : do-, na-, o-, od-, po-, pro-, pře-, při-, roz-, s-, u-, v-, vy-, za-.

40|$|The {{question}} of how word morphology is coded and retrieved during visual word recognition {{has given rise to}} a large number of empirical studies. The results, however, do not enable one to decide between alternative models of morphological representation and processing. It is argued in this paper that the contrast between pseudoprefixed words and <b>non-prefixed</b> control words can provide an empirical basis for deciding between hypotheses of morphology representation as sublexical or lexical. This contrast has been used in the three lexical decision experiments reported here, which show that decision times for pseudoprefixed words are significantly slower than for <b>non-prefixed</b> control words. This pseudoprefixation effect strongly supports the hypothesis that morphology is coded and processed sublexically during word recognition. The experimental conditions employed allow both strategic and strictly orthographic explanations for the pseudoprefixation effect to be dismissed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the importance of prefixes as sublexical cues for stress assignment during reading aloud English disyllabic words. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that prefixes repel stress (Rastle & Coltheart, 2000) by investigating the likelihood with which patients with surface dyslexia assign second-syllable stress to prefixed words. Five such patients were presented with three types of disyllabic words for reading aloud: 'regular' prefixed words with weak-strong stress pattern (e. g., remind); 'irregular' prefixed words with strong-weak stress pattern (e. g., reflex); and <b>non-prefixed</b> words with strong-weak stress pattern (e. g., scandal). Results showed that all five patients frequently regularized the strong-weak prefixed words by pronouncing them with second syllable stress. These regularization errors provide strong evidence for the functional role of prefixes in stress assignment during reading. Additional computational simulations using the rule-based algorithm for pronouncing disyllables developed by Rastle and Coltheart (2000) and the CDP++ model of reading aloud (Perry et al., 2010) allowed us to evaluate how these two opponent approaches to reading aloud fare in respect of the patient data. 15 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} valency {{increase}} and decrease mechanisms in Agul (Lezgic, Nakh-Daghestanian). We deal with agentivization of intransitive and deagentivization of transitive predicates; {{in other words}} the problem setting {{is limited to the}} conventional causative ~ labile ~ decausative domain. The paper focuses on non-derived (i. e. <b>non-prefixed</b> and non-composite) Agul verbs. 1. CAUSATIVES. The only productive causativization pattern in Agul is a combination of the infinitive of the main verb with (a) q’as ‘do ’ (‘do’-causatives below). The causer NP is Ergative. With an intransitive predicate, the causee NP keeps its Nominative or (with experiential predicates) Dative marking. With a transitive predicate the causee NP is marked Apudessive (one of the spatial cases). The ‘do’-causative is a default causativization pattern. It is available for all verbal lexemes except stative verbs (which do not form causatives); only ‘do’-causatives are available for transitive predicates. With intransitive predicates, there are three non-productive valency-increasing patterns in addition to ‘do’-causatives.

40|$|Ternary Content Addressable Memories (TCAMs) {{have become}} the de facto {{standard}} in industry for fast packet classification. Unfortunately, TCAMs have limitations of small capacity, high power consumption, high heat generation, and high cost. The well-known range expansion problem exacerbates the problem of smaller TCAMs by significantly decreasing the already limited capacity of these TCAMs as each classifier rule typically has to be converted to multiple TCAM rules. One method for coping with smaller TCAMs is to use compression schemes {{to reduce the number}} of TCAM rules required to represent a classifier. Although several TCAM-based classifier compression schemes have been proposed, they are all limited to producing prefix classifiers, which means that they all miss the compression opportunities created by <b>non-prefix</b> ternary classifiers. In this paper, we propose bit weaving, the first nonprefix classifier compression scheme. Bit weaving is based on the observation that adjacent TCAM entries that have a hamming distance of one (i. e., differ by only one bit) can be merged into one entry by replacing the bit in question with *. Bit weaving consists of two new techniques, bit swapping and bit merging, to first identify and then merge such rules together. The key advantages of bit weaving are that it runs fast, and it is composable with other TCAM optimization methods as a pre/postprocessing routine. We implemented bit weaving and conducted experiments on both real-world and synthetic packet classifiers. Our experimental results show the following: (i) bit weaving is an effective stand-alone compression technique (it achieves an average compression ratio of 23. 6 %) and (ii) bit weaving finds compression opportunities that other methods miss. Specifically, bit weaving improves the prior TCAM optimization techniques of TCAM Razor and Topological Transformation by an average of 12. 8 % and 36. 5 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Set {{within the}} {{generative}} syntactic tradition, {{the present article}} examines the interchange in the lay­out of the reflexive/ reciprocal marker (RM) and the verb in prefixed and prefixless Lithuanian verbs, a long-standing historical puzzle. It is first shown that the RM is obligatorily coreferential with {{the subject of the}} sentence. Given the generative premise that all subjects are merged within the verb, it is argued that the RM is a physically manifest trace of the subject and forms a binding domain with its antecedent, which stipulates the layout of morphemes within the verb. In addition, the position of the RM also depends on whether its antecedent is an agent, experiencer, or theme, since these have different merging, i. e. original, positions. After the relationship between the RM, the sentence subject and the verb has been defined, prefixes are examined since they form the left boundary of the RM in prefixed verbs. Given their resultative meaning, verbal prefixes are argued to occupy an aspectual position AspP, placed immediately above the verbal complex, i. e. v/VP and the RM within it. Since in non-contrastive contexts, the negative clitic is attached to the verb and consequently affects the position of the RM in otherwise prefixless verbs, inducing change just as the resultative prefixes, the binding domain is determined for the following types of the morphological composition of the verb: prefixed and <b>non-prefixed</b> positive and negative verb forms...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} {{semantics}} of the Russian prefix вы- in so-called natural perfective verbs. Traditionally {{it is considered}} that prefixes of natural perfective verbs do not change {{the meaning of the}} base verb and thus do not have lexical meaning, i. e. they are “empty”. The only meaning they are supposed to have is the meaning “to bring an action to the end”, which is claimed to be a “purely aspectual” meaning. In the present work, we argue that verbal prefixes have lexical meaning. We use the apparatus of cognitive linguistics and Construction Grammar to defend our argument. With the help of cognitive semantics we show that the meanings of the вы- prefixes of the natural perfectives are interrelated. We accommodate all the meanings in a coherent network. It is furthermore shown that the meaning “to bring an action to the end” is a part of this network, and thus it is a lexical and not “purely aspectual” meaning. The idea behind “empty” prefixes is that they are devoid of content because the prefixed verb has the same lexical meaning as the corresponding <b>non-prefixed</b> verb. However, we propose that the prefix have a lexical meaning, but that this meaning is “masked” because it repeats the meaning of the verb stem. In our analysis of constructions we argue that the meaning of the prefix is always repeated somewhere else in the construction – either in the semantics of the verb stem or in a preposition phrase. Proponents of “empty” prefixes would therefore be forced to maintain the slightly absurd position that the prefix is always empty. In this way, our analysis contributes to solving the problem of “empty” prefixes...|$|E
40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityLearning to read consists of processes that allow the reader to recognize print, understand words and comprehend text. Thus, vocabulary {{is one of the}} most fundamental elements for reading comprehension. Learners can acquire new words from text upon the first encounter with a new word on the basis of fast mapping. Teachers also contribute to students' vocabulary growth by teaching them words and strategies such as word analysis, to help them become independent vocabulary learners. For English language learners (ELLs), the task of learning English words may be increasingly difficult as they may not have had the same oral exposure to vocabulary as their native English speaking peers. Thus, ELLs who have less experience with the English language, but who use the strategy of word analysis to decipher the meaning of unknown morphologically complex words, may experience errors of fast mapping. Hence, the purpose of this study was to determine whether ELL third-grade students make errors of fast mapping when using the strategy of word analysis to decipher the meaning of unknown words. Four-eight year old third grade ELL students completed the 4 -Stage Method for Prefixed and Suffixed Words and the 3 -Stage Method for Compound Words to learn word analysis to decipher the meaning of prefixed, suffixed and compound words. Students were administered the Prefix Assessment, a measure of knowledge about prefixes, the Suffix Assessment, a measure of knowledge about suffixes, and the Compound Words Assessments, a measure of knowledge about compound words, to identify errors of fast mapping of identification and definition of words. Data were analyzed using Chi-Square, One Sample Binomial test and percent of errors of fast mapping were calculated. Findings suggest that participants presented more errors of fast mapping with prefixed and suffixed words than with <b>non-prefixed</b> and non-suffixed words. Participants identified more new prefixes and suffixes in words, and transparent compound words than defined new prefixed, suffixed and transparent compound words. However, participants were able to identify and define transparent compound words to a greater extent than prefixed and suffixed words.
