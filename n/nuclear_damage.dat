It is often argued that this potential shortfall in liability represents an external cost not included in the cost of nuclear electricity; but the cost is small, amounting to about 0.1% of the levelized cost of electricity, according to a CBO study.|$|E
40|$|Pyrethroids {{are one of}} {{the most}} widely used class of {{insecticides}} and their toxicity is dominated by pharmacological actions upon the CNS. This study reports as the subchronic treatment (60 days) with permethrin (PERM) (1 / 10 of LD 50) induced <b>nuclear</b> DNA <b>damage</b> in rat striatum cells. Comet assay outcomes showed that PERM produced singleand double–strand breaks in striatum cells, the DNA damage was not related to oxidation at pyrimidine and purine bases. Vitamin E (280 mg/kg body weight/day) and vitamin Ecoenzyme Q 10 (10 mg/kg/ 3 ml) supplementation could protect PERM treated rats against <b>nuclear</b> DNA <b>damage.</b> With the aim to evaluate the cause of <b>nuclear</b> DNA <b>damage</b> observed in striatum of rat treated with PERM, in vitro studies on striatum submitochondrial particles (SMPs) and on striatum cells treated with 10 M PERM alone or plus 16 or 32 nM GSH were performed. SMPs incubated with PERM showed a decrease in superoxide anion release from the electron transport chain by inhibition of mitochondrial complex I. The effect could be related to the decrease of membrane fluidity measured in the hydrophilic- hydrophobic region of the mitochondrial membrane. This result discarded the involvement of the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in the <b>nuclear</b> DNA <b>damage.</b> On the contrary, GSH played a crucial role on striatum since it was able to protect the cells against <b>nuclear</b> DNA <b>damage</b> induced by PERM. In conclusion our outcomes suggested that <b>nuclear</b> DNA <b>damage</b> of striatum cells was directly related to GSH depletion due to PERM insecticide...|$|R

The research has found that the species representatives living in the small rivers demonstrated worse cytogenetic homeostasis indicators compared to the fish from the medium rivers: the lowest frequency of P. fluviatilis’ <b>nuclear</b> <b>damages</b> appeared to be 4. 25 times higher for the individuals living in the small rivers given the noticeable excess of spontaneous mutations by average damage frequency. Fish morphological homeostasis demonstrates a tendency to injuries in small rivers as well. The functional relationships between the studied parameters which have been established by the author were “close” for the fish from the small rivers and primary “moderate” for the fish from the medium rivers. It is concluded that the enhanced activity of the stressors existing in the water environment affects the physiological state of the P. fluviatilis species...|$|R

40|$|Pollution has {{no limits}} and its local (national) effects could quickly evolve into regional, {{continental}} or worldly effects. That is why {{protecting the environment}} from the aggressive factors must be a concern for each human being on the planet and especially for those who take decisions regarding issues of this field. [3] One {{of the most dangerous}} forms of aggression over the living and non-living world is nuclear pollution, an almost perfect aggression, with a multiple and universal character, because all of the components of environment are affected: earth, water, air, life. It is the most perfidious destructive force because it destroys in a slow but certain fashion any form of life. It is invisible, without color or smell, it doesn’t cause immediate pain and has no established or known limits in time. Regarding the risks briefly presented earlier, a careful survey is required, but above all, elaborate legal regulations of nuclear power production and utilization, to avoid accidents that can cause serious damage to people and to the environment. Sometimes nuclear pollution can’t be avoided even though security measures are taken. The danger and also possible <b>nuclear</b> <b>damages</b> caused to the environment, persist. That is why the issue of the legal responsibility for <b>nuclear</b> <b>damages</b> arises, and also the legal responsibility of damage repairs in the field of nuclear power production and employment...|$|R

TEPCO’s stock price lost the largest for direct <b>damage</b> of its <b>nuclear</b> plants in Fukushima. Also nuclear business stock prices drooped. We find that the more a power company depends on nuclear energy; its stock price dropped more after the accident. In contrast, alternative energy stock prices gained from the accident. The abnormal returns depend on business compositions of energy stocks and nuclear business stocks. We find that the market believes the primary beneficiary of the Act was TEPCO but other power companies did not gained much...|$|R

Defects in DNA damage-induced apoptosis contribute to tumorigenesis and to the resistance of cancer cells to a variety of therapeutic agents. The intranuclear mechanisms that signal apoptosis after DNA damage overlap with those that initiate cell cycle arrest and DNA repair, and the early events in these pathways are highly conserved. In addition, multiple independent routes have recently been traced by which <b>nuclear</b> DNA <b>damage</b> can be signalled to the mitochondria, tipping the balance in favour of cell death rather than repair and survival.
