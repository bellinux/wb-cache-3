5|$|Twenty {{isotopes}} {{of sodium}} are known, but only 23Na is stable. 23Na is {{created in the}} carbon-burning process in stars by fusing two carbon atoms together; this requires temperatures above 600 megakelvins and a star {{of at least three}} solar masses. Two radioactive, cosmogenic isotopes are the byproduct of cosmic ray spallation: 22Na has a half-life of 2.6 years and 24Na, a half-life of 15 hours; all other isotopes have a half-life of less than one minute. Two nuclear isomers have been discovered, the longer-lived one being 24mNa with a half-life of around 20.2 milliseconds. Acute <b>neutron</b> <b>radiation,</b> as from a nuclear criticality accident, converts some of the stable 23Na in human blood to 24Na; the <b>neutron</b> <b>radiation</b> dosage of a victim can be calculated by measuring the concentration of 24Na relative to 23Na.|$|E

40|$|International audienceGadolinium-covered {{modified}} plastic scintillators show a {{high potential}} for the deployment of cost-effective neutron detectors. Taking advantage of the low-energy photon and electron signature of thermal neutron captures in gadolinium- 155 and gadolinium- 157 however requires a background correction. In order to display a trustable rate, dual compensation schemes appear {{as an alternative to}} Pulse Shape Discrimination. This paper presents the application of such a compensation scheme to a two-bismuth loaded plastic scintillator system. A detection scintillator interacts with incident photon and fast <b>neutron</b> <b>radiations</b> and is covered with a gadolinium converter to become thermal neutron-sensitive as well. In the meantime, an identical compensation scintillator, covered with terbium, solely interacts with the photon and fast neutron part of incident radiations. After the acquisition and the treatment of the counting signals from both sensors, a hypothesis test determines whether the resulting count rate after subtraction falls into statistical fluctuations or provides a robust image of neutron activity. A laboratory prototype is tested under both photon and <b>neutron</b> <b>radiations,</b> allowing us to investigate the performance of the overall compensation system. The study reveals satisfactory results in terms of robustness to a cesium- 137 background and in terms of sensitivity in presence of a californium- 252 source...|$|R

5|$|Isotopes of {{californium}} {{with mass}} numbers 237–256 are formed in nuclear reactors; californium-253 is a β-emitter {{and the rest}} are α-emitters. The isotopes with even mass numbers (250Cf, 252Cf and 254Cf) have {{a high rate of}} spontaneous fission, especially 254Cf of which 99.7% decays by spontaneous fission. Californium-249 has a relatively long half-life (352 years), weak spontaneous fission and strong γ-emission that facilitates its identification. 249Cf is not formed in large quantities in a nuclear reactor because of the slow β-decay of the parent isotope 249Bk and a large cross section of interaction with neutrons, but it can be accumulated in the isotopically pure form as the β-decay product of (pre-selected) 249Bk. Californium produced by reactor-irradiation of plutonium mostly consists of 250Cf and 252Cf, the latter being predominant for large neutron fluences, and its study is hindered by the strong <b>neutron</b> <b>radiation.</b>|$|E

25|$|A neutron bomb, {{technically}} {{referred to}} as an enhanced radiation weapon (ERW), {{is a type of}} tactical nuclear weapon designed specifically to release a large portion of its energy as energetic <b>neutron</b> <b>radiation.</b> This contrasts with standard thermonuclear weapons, which are designed to capture this intense <b>neutron</b> <b>radiation</b> to increase its overall explosive yield. In terms of yield, ERWs typically produce about one-tenth that of a fission-type atomic weapon. Even with their significantly lower explosive power, ERWs are still capable of much greater destruction than any conventional bomb. Meanwhile, relative to other nuclear weapons, damage is more focused on biological material than on material infrastructure (though extreme blast and heat effects are not eliminated).|$|E
25|$|The <b>neutron</b> <b>radiation</b> {{serves to}} transmute the {{surrounding}} matter, often rendering it radioactive.

25|$|Alpha and beta {{radiation}} have low penetrating power and {{are unlikely to}} affect vital internal organs from outside the body.

Gamma and <b>neutron</b> <b>radiation</b> can travel much further distances and penetrate the body easily, so whole-body irradiation generally causes ARS before skin effects are evident.

The main distinction is that fusion power produces no high-level radioactive waste (though activated station materials {{still need to be}} disposed of).

40|$|Preliminary {{evaluations}} of the DT- 236 /PD U. S. Army battlefield personnel dosimeter were performed at the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI) from the summer of 1984 to the spring of 1985. This personnel dosimetry system is being procured by the U. S. Army for use by combat forces in theaters of operation where tactical nuclear weapons could be used. In operation, the wristwatch-style dosimeter is worn by a soldier to record both instantaneous and residual gamma and <b>neutron</b> <b>radiations</b> that are released from the detonation of a nuclear weapon, plus gamma radiation from fallout. The dosimeter contains a block of radiophotoluminescent glass as the gamma detector and a silicon diode as the neutron detector. Properties of these detectors have been described in various review articles (1). The reader unit simultaneously evaluates both of the radiation detectors and presents a total dose reading on a panel meter. Earlier tests of this dosimetry system at the U. S.
