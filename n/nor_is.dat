Her Majesty's Government responded that the local planning authorities are responsible for general control of development in their areas and are required to take into consideration the views of interested persons and particularly local communities. In regard to this specific proposal, the government was informed by the Newham London Borough Council that there is neither a current planning permission or application for a mosque, <b>nor</b> <b>is</b> one expected in the near future. In September 2012, a planning application was submitted to Newham Council and is under consideration by them.|$|E

Design {{management is}} multifaceted, {{and so are the}} different applications of and views on design management. The function of design management in an organisation depends on its tasks, authority, and practice.|$|E

No signal conversion is necessary, <b>nor</b> <b>is</b> there a loss of video quality when a DVI-to-HDMI adapter is used.

The hospital is part of University Hospital of North Norway, while the airport is operated by state-owned Avinor. Ny-Ålesund and Barentsburg remain company towns with all infrastructure owned by Kings Bay and Arktikugol, respectively. Other public offices with presence on Svalbard are the Norwegian Directorate of Mining, the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Tax Administration and the Church of Norway. Svalbard is subordinate to Nord-Troms District Court and Hålogaland Court of Appeal, both located in Tromsø.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have suggested that}} Muḥammad used the term Allah in addressing both pagan Arabs and Jews or Christians {{in order to establish}} a common ground for the understanding of the name for God, a claim Gerhard Böwering says is doubtful. According to Böwering, in contrast with pre-Islamic Arabian polytheism, God in Islam does not have associates and companions, <b>nor</b> <b>is</b> there any kinship between God and jinn. Pre-Islamic pagan Arabs believed in a blind, powerful, inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control. This was replaced with the Islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful God.|$|E

It is not merely a landscaped or ornamental garden, although it may be artistic, <b>nor</b> <b>is</b> it an experiment station or yet a park with labels on the plants. The essential element is the intention of the enterprise, which is the acquisition and dissemination of botanical knowledge.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no reason}} why the writ of error should be {{confined}} to civil cases. A man's life, his liberty, and his good name, are as dear to him as his property; and inferior courts are as liable to err in one case as in the other.

They have been frequent in that country from which we have drawn almost all our forms of judicial proceedings.|$|E
5|$|When {{multiple}} different alleles for a gene {{are present}} in a species's population it is called polymorphic. Most different alleles are functionally equivalent, however some alleles can give rise to different phenotypic traits. A gene's most common allele is called the wild type, and rare alleles are called mutants. The genetic variation in relative frequencies of different alleles in a population is due to both natural selection and genetic drift. The wild-type allele {{is not necessarily the}} ancestor of less common alleles, <b>nor</b> <b>is</b> it necessarily fitter.|$|E
