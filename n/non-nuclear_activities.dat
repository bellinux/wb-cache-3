The potential for a nuclear criticality accident is one concern that is unique to the nuclear industry. However, if managed properly, the risk of a criticality accident can be reduced to an acceptable level.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{attempts}} {{to show how}} Lean Thinking and Strategic Logistics concepts applied to Orga-nization’s design and structure can result on an effective and efficient approach. A Strategic Logistics organi-zation model was developed, in accordance with Lean Thinking principles. A pilot project was implemented in {{a small group of}} SME’s and now it is being prepared to be implemented in a technological park. The model addresses a simplified organization structure with two branches or dimensions- Logistics and Mission- based on Business Process Management (BPM) and Activity Based Cost and Management (ABCM); it eases the outsourcing of <b>non-nuclear</b> <b>activities</b> and establishes a proper framework to increase the focus on organiza-tion’s core business. With this approach considerable advantages are expected to be achieved, such as fewer activities, less processes, less people and less costs. In addition, higher service level, effectiveness, efficiency, more flexible organization, and a better image are expected. The innovation work related to this paper is an attempt to implement Lean Principles at a superior level of the organization: the organization design level...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Considering {{the risk}} of radiation, the {{measurement}} of the natural radiation sources seems to be necessary. In this study, the concentrations of the natural radionuclides, namely 226 Ra, 232 Th, and 40 K, were measured in the soil samples taken from different locations of Golestan, Iran. The measurement results {{can also be used}} as a baseline to evaluate the impact of <b>non-nuclear</b> <b>activities</b> and the routine releases of nuclear installations. Materials and Methods: A total of 42 soil samples were collected. The samples were sealed for at least three weeks to ensure the secular equilibrium between 226 Ra and 232 Th and their respective radioactive progenies. The activity concentrations of natural radionuclides in soil samples were measured using a shielded HPGe detector. Results: The average activity concentrations of 226 Ra, 232 Th, and 40 K were 23, 31, and 453 Bq. kg- 1, respectively. To assess the radiological hazards, the Ra equivalent activity as well as the external and internal hazard indices were estimated. Radium equivalent varied within the range of 58. 4 - 142. 6 Bq. kg- 1 with a mean value of 102. 4 Bq. kg- 1. The estimated mean values of Hex and Hin (0. 28 and 0. 34, respectively) in the area under investigation were lower than unity as desirable. Therefore, it did not pose any health risks to the population of the area. Conclusion: The results of this study were compared with those of other studies carried out in other countries. As the findings of the present study indicated, the health-related risks causing by the naturally accruing radionuclides was very low in the investigated area...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNuclear type 1 protein {{phosphatase}} (PP 1) {{activity in}} primary culture of EGF-stimulated hepatocytes was significantly and transiently increased at the G 1 /S transition, being about 2. 5 -fold, while that in non-stimulated hepatocytes showed almost no change. On the other hand, <b>non-nuclear</b> PP 1 <b>activity</b> was gradually increased until the G 1 /S transition, but the activity showed {{no difference between}} EGF-stimulated and non-stimulated hepatocytes. Under growth-inhibited conditions {{in the presence of}} TGFβ 1, the increase in nuclear PP 1 activity was completely suppressed, whereas <b>non-nuclear</b> PP 1 <b>activity</b> was little affected. Such close correlation between nuclear PP 1 activity and growth factor-induced positive or negative growth signaling strongly suggests an involvement of PP 1 in progression from G 1 to S phase of hepatocytes. On Western immunoblotting using antisera for PP 1 α, PP 1 γ 1, and PP 1 δ, no isoform showed any change in amount under these conditions. Mechanism(s) of growth-associated alterations in nuclear PP 1 activity is discussed...|$|R
