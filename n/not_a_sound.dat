25|$|Jaffe et al. {{were able}} to perform an {{experiment}} in which they discovered how O. bauri recognizes one another. The recognition signal does not pertain to environmental cues, since O. bauri attacked ants which were kept in the colony surrounded by a wire mesh capsule more than the controls, which were kept inside the colony. To further rule out environmental cues as an option, Jaffe et al. fed two different colonies the same diet and fed a single colony two different diets. When the trap jaw ants from the single colony but different diets met they did not attack each other. However, when the ants from two different colonies but same diets met they attacked each other roughly 75% of the time. Additionally, the recognition signal is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> or a particular behavior since O. bauri is able to recognize dead nestmates. Jaffe et al. was able to determine that the recognition signal must be a type of smell, since ants which were freeze dried or in a plastic wire mesh capsule were never attacked.|$|E
500|$|The {{eruption}} {{was heard}} {{hundreds of miles}} away, but {{some of those who}} survived the eruption declared that the landslide and pyroclastic flows were silent as they raced down the mountain.

500|$|In March2015, Iwata put part of Nintendo's {{focus on}} the growing mobile game market, {{creating}} a landmark partnership with mobile provider DeNA to publish titles, as traditional hardware console sales began to falter. This came {{in stark contrast to}} the company's previous business model which put focus on console exclusive titles to prompt people to buy their platforms. Iwata emphasized that although Nintendo IPs would be utilized in mobile games, the company would not compromise their integrity. He also stressed that the main goal would be to reach as many people as possible rather than which options would earn the most money, similar to the idea behind the Wii. After the partnership with DeNA was established, Iwata reiterated his stance that the common free-to-play type mobile games, which he referred to as [...] "free-to-start," [...] threatened the future quality of games. Although he acknowledged the practice as a viable means of promoting titles in the short-term, he considered the model outdated and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> direction for core development. He also emphasized that the business model for these games did not match with the core values of Nintendo and could not serve as the basis of [...] "long-lasting relationship with [...] customers".|$|E
