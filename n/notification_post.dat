(2) Some safety-related services that desire multihops of message forwarding (e.g., road caution hazard <b>notification,</b> and <b>post</b> crash <b>notification)</b> can be transmitted as routine safety message because delay requirement for the services is relatively longer (0.5 – 2 seconds).

A boy {{appeared}} within, and the porter or keeper, at a distance, along the inner passage, called to us to enter; and, opening the door of the great hall, left us to view it till he should be at leisure to attend to us. Truly it is a most magnificent apartment; very lofty,--so lofty, indeed, that the antique oak roof was quite hidden, as regarded all its details, in the sombre gloom that brooded under its rafters. The hall was lighted by four great windows, I think, on each of the two sides, descending half-way from the ceiling to the floor, leaving all beneath enclosed by oaken panelling, which, on three sides, was carved with escutcheons of such members of the society as have held the office of reader. There is likewise, in a large recess or transept, a great window, occupying the full height of the hall, and splendidly emblazoned with the arms of the Templars who have attained to the dignity of Chief Justices. The other windows are pictured, in like manner, with coats of arms of local dignitaries connected with the Temple; and besides all these there are arched lights, high towards the roof, at either end full of richly and chastely colored glass, and all the illumination that the great hall had come through these glorious panes, and they seemed the richer for the sombreness in which we stood. I cannot describe, or even intimate, the effect of this transparent glory, glowing down upon us in that gloomy depth of the hall. The screen at the lower end was of carved oak, very dark and highly polished, and as old as Queen Elizabeth's time. The keeper told us that the story of the Armada was said to be represented in these carvings, but in the imperfect light we could trace nothing of it out. Along the length of the apartment were set two oaken tables for the students of law to dine upon; and on the dais, at the upper end, there was a cross-table for the big-wigs of the society; the latter being provided with comfortable chairs, and the former with oaken benches. From a <b>notification,</b> <b>posted</b> near the door, I gathered that the cost of dinners is two shillings to each gentleman, including, as the attendant told me, ale and wine. I am reluctant to leave this hall without expressing how grave, how grand, how sombre, and how magnificent I feel it to be.

However, limited {{progress has been made}} to consolidate the management of their assets. According to department officials, when Congress established the Treasury Forfeiture Fund in 1992, it recognized the differences in the programs' missions, which warranted creating separate programs, and this encouraged independent operational decisions that eventually created differences between the programs. There are some differences between the programs, but both departments seize similar assets such as vehicles. Nevertheless, the departments have not assessed the feasibility of consolidation, including whether such efforts would be cost-effective, and continue to duplicate efforts by separately managing and disposing of their seized and forfeited property. Specifically, Justice and Treasury maintain four separate information technology (IT) asset tracking systems, which perform similar functions to support their respective asset forfeiture program activities. In addition, both departments procure separate national contracts for the management of real property and they separately store assets seized under each program that are in some cases located within the same geographic area. For example, both the United States Marshals Service (Marshals) [...] the primary custodian of Justice's seized assets [...] and Treasury maintain vehicle storage facilities, 40 percent of which are within 20 miles of each other. GAO recognizes the separate legal authorities of the asset forfeiture funds, but those authorities do not preclude consolidating certain management activities within the programs. Conducting a study to evaluate the feasibility of consolidation that considers associated costs and benefits, among other things, could help Justice and Treasury effectively identify the extent to which consolidation would help increase efficiency, effectiveness, and cost savings. ...|$|R
3000|$|GMO {{monitoring}} {{should take}} place in areas exposed to GMO, preferably cultivated fields and their environment, but should include also regions with no or unknown GMO exposure. On a case-by-case basis depending on the GMO characteristics, the selected indicators, checkpoints and related analytical methods should consider relevant different spatial and temporal scales [49, 22]. Hence, the monitoring of ecological effects of GMO must be standardised with regard to parameters, methods, survey intervals and sites so that data are comparable in terms of measurement methods and, thus, can be analysed statistically and interpreted meaningfully [22]. This comprises standards concerning molecular-biological detection methods, vegetation mapping and faunistic surveys to evaluate changes in population density and behaviour of endangered species, for example. This standardisation is to ensure a Germany-wide comparability of sampling data and to provide legal certainty for the user [50]. Accordingly, the WebGIS GMO monitoring should support realisation of particular parts of the guideline VDI 4330 [22]: [...] "Monitoring the ecological effects of genetically modified organisms - Basic principles and strategies" [...] (VDI 4330, part 1), [...] "Pollen monitoring: Pollen sampling using pollen mass filters (PMF) and Sigma- 2 samplers" [...] (VDI 4330, part 3), [...] "Pollen monitoring: Biological sampling by honey bees" [...] (VDI 4330, part 4). In this context, Reuter et al. (2006, 2010) [23, 24] developed a concept of an information system for GMO monitoring (ISMO). The database concept encompasses three components: The [...] "Knowledge Database" [...] comprises information related to different levels of biological organisation being affected by GMO cultivation.

40|$|Today we have {{a plethora}} of {{telecommunication}} gadgets within our grasp, with many higher education institutions are using them to ‘push’ content to students. Pushing can be describe as transferring real-time content {{in the form of}} a short message to a user. In the past, push-technology was used primarily to indicate a web page had been updated. The subscriber (willing or not) was sent an alert via email or a web pop-up notifying them that web content had just been updated. We have moved on from this, and are now pushing content to a user via their mobile phone. The modern mobile phone is used not only for voice calls but can be used for text, video and image messages, as well as web browsing, applications, and locationawareness. Therefore it is a device in which an array of content can be delivered. But what content do higher education students want pushed to their mobile phones? The study reported here has taken an open approach,in that it investigated what students want pushed to their mobile phones, and whether the content should be sent automatically or only if they requested it (that is via subscription). Additionally, the study compared what university administrators perceive students want pushed to their mobile phones to what students wanted. The study found that administrators’ perceptions of what and when student wanted particular content pushed to their mobile phones often differed to what the students wanted. Findings show that students would like automatically pushed short messages that covered areas such as crisis messages, outages, census dates, and lecture cancellations. This however differed somewhat to what administrators’ perceived students wanted. Furthermore, when you add the option of subscribing to particular services, their notification type (automatic or subscription), students and administrators had differing opinions.

40|$|Presentations I Attended “The One” Project – University of Toronto Mississauga In 2005 UofT Mississauga (part of University of Toronto) began “The One” Project. The {{goal was}} to enhance student {{services}} by providing one identity, one card, one phone number, and one helpdesk. UofT has a highly decentralized IT structure. For example they have 128 distinct email systems. A central IT department provides the network backbone {{and access to the}} internet. 60 % of the IT expenditures are done at the divisional level. The Mississauga has a more centralized IT structure providing all IT services. Staff and students had to deal with two or more login ideas; UTMid was used by Mississauga and UTORid was used by the main campus. Mostly due to the budget the Mississauga campus began using the UTORid and the UofT’s mail system (UTORmail). One ID and one mail system allowed helpdesk’s from both facilities to provide support. Due to the available resources, the migration was handled in two steps: Students followed by faculty and staff. They were able to take the lessoned learned and ease the transition for faculty and staff. The Mississauga Compute Services department managed 21, 500 employee and student accounts. They had to deal with approximately 200 account name clashes in UofT system. They could not afford to revamp their desktops or servers. Changes were tested in a virtual environment. In addition to the UTORid they needed to support Kerberos. Unix/Linux servers supported Kerberos with minimal modification. They considered running Linux desktops with Citrix providing access to Windows applications. One application did not work with Citrix so they settled on Microsoft’s Active Directory. The change was advertised to students through email, flyers and <b>notifications</b> <b>posted</b> on the websites. When the changes were put in to place the Mississauga websites redirected students to the UofT websites where the new login information was supplied. In addition to a single sign on they also implemented a speech recognition telephone system from Nuance. The University of Toronto’s ID cards system was adopted by the Mississauga campus which allowed students from each campus to grant/deny access and/or pay for services at each campus. Lessons learned: •	They allocated enough resources; 5 Mississauga IT staff and 2 UofT staff. •	Clear communication and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances (e. g. getting nowhere with a vendor) was required. •	Not all practices could be adapted in to existing systems. For example the home-built Mississauga Helpdesk tracking software was replaced by “Request Tracker”. Request Tracker is an open source helpdesk application which they tailored to their needs. •	One general phone number resulted in 93 % of calls to be routed to the correct department •	Effective project management allowed critical timelines to be met. They feel that the ease of use of the systems has been improved. Other divisional IT groups are looking to adopt some of the pieces of the project (mostly the identity and authentication piece. Reduce Response Time: Get “Hooked” on a Wiki - Valparaiso University The IT department tackled the knowledge base issue. They were faced with the challenge of how to communicate the right information to internal and external customers. The {{goal was to}} improve service and also encourage the flow of information. They began by evaluating the tools that they were using to facilitate the flow of information. They were using First Level Support (FLS) – a component that is included with HEAT as their knowledge base. Articles are stored and searched in a tree structure. The small plain text search window is not resizable and readily displays tree structure information rather than information that describes the article. The professionals and student employees needed something more robust, user friendly that was more interactive and not platform dependant. With the help of a Unix admin they decided on MediaWiki, an open source web based application that is also used by Wikipedia. MediaWiki provides search results by page name and content. It organizes results in what it thinks are the most likely matches. Pages can be bookmarked for future reference. Using the wiki, staff can accumulate knowledge independently. They are able to offer feedback on existing pages. The wiki offers real time, account or system specific information such as account quotas and alias information. Helpdesk policies and procedures are available on the wiki in an indexed and searchable arrangement. Helpdesk staff first search the wiki when they do not know the answer to the problem. If the information does not exist, they create a page (without having knowledge of HTML) when they have the solution. MediaWiki includes moderation options that can prevent incorrect information from being published. The system can send email notifications to users or groups who are responsible for information. There is version control that allows moderators to view and compare past documents. They needed groups within the organization to have authority over their respective sections. Since the employees are encouraged to update the information it help to eliminate the bottleneck and free up the time of the employees who were previously responsible for updates to the knowledge base. FLS did not have the capability to monitor who was making changes so if all staff were allowed to make changes {{there was no way to}} keep unapproved information from being visible to staff. When they made the transition to MediaWiki they found that over 50 % of their knowledge base articles were out date - requiring updates or obsolete. LDAP support was not included with MediaWiki out of the box but an extension was available. Since there is no built in way to hide information they have decided to run two instances of the wiki. One that is considered internal for staff (including students on the helpdesk) and the other that is viewable by the public. Unrelated to the wiki, they have been are continuing to use HEAT as their call tracking tool. Since the 90 ’s they’ve been using it pretty much out of the box. Their goal is to move towards ITIL and they have recently revamped their call classification from 1 tier to seven tier. Their new classification system aims to help prompt Helpdesk attendants with the common questions to ask – they want them to ask questions. E. g. : 	-Device (PC) 		-Person (Student or Staff) 			-Application Name 				-Do they have access, corruption, etc. The overhaul for their classification system took approximately six weeks. American ITIL – Hobart and William Smith Colleges ITIL stands for Information Technology Infrastructure Library. It is a set of concepts and techniques for managing IT infrastructure, development and operations. In other words it provides a set of best practices. Hobart and William Smith Colleges (HWS) explained how ITIL is influencing how they handle incident management, problem management, service level agreements (SLA), operating level agreements (OLA), creation of metrics, and the beginning stages of how to design a service catalog. ITIL can be considered a framework that can be adapted to suit the needs of an organization. Published benefits included: •	Reduced costs •	Improved customer satisfaction due to a more professional approach to service delivery •	Improved productivity •	Improved use of skills and experience Hobart and William Smith Colleges is selectively choosing which components of the framework to use. The best practices that make up ITIL are documented in a series of books which are updated as the concepts evolve. The five core titles are service strategy, service design, service transition, service operation and continual service improvement. The service strategy explains how service management should be designed, developed and implemented. Service design targets the design and development of services offered and how the services will be managed. A service catalog (either a database structured document) lists what services are offered and includes information such as deliverables, prices, contact points, and how to order. Hobart and William Smith Colleges currently has a service catalog in its early stages in the form of a excel spreadsheet. Operation level agreements document define the workflow and procedures for the IT services department and other departments within the organization. HWS does not publish their OLAs. A service level agreement is an agreement between the IT services department and the customer. SLAs basically define what a customer can expect in terms of timeframe and deliverables but also serve to communicate the IT department’s expectations in terms of required information and how much notice is required. HWS publishes their SLAs. Service transition is essentially another name for change management. The aim is to control the lifecycle of all changes and prevent disruption of other services. Service operation refers to the delivery of support services to ensure they are of value for the customer and the service provider. Incident management is responsible for managing the lifecycle of all reported incidents. HWS is implementing an enterprise information system that will provide college constituents with information tools and processes that support a broad set of mission critical operations. In Computing Services and other departments in AU we use HEAT to log incidents and to assist with the workflow process. As with our Helpdesk, HWS’s service desk is the single point of contact for all IT service related requests not including project work. Problem management, the other major component of service operation is the process responsible for managing the lifecycle of all problems. The basic goal is to prevent incidents from happening and minimize the impact of incidents that cannot be prevented. When a large scale problem occurs HWS pulls together the team that solve the problem and investigates the|$|R
