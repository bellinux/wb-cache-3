5|$|Initially, forecasters at the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center {{predicted}} that Matthew {{would take a}} more eastern track and hit the Florida Panhandle. Because the track shifted westward, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center issued a Tropical Storm Warning from the Florida/Alabama border to Intracoastal City, Louisiana {{on the day before}} landfall.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on July 27 as detected by Meteosat imagery. By July 31 the tropical wave began being classified, using the Dvorak Technique, by satellite analysts at the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center, in part due to persistent deep convection. Shortly thereafter the system organized enough that the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center began classifying it as Tropical Depression Five, roughly halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. The depression moved westward at 17mph (28km/h), intensifying as it did so, and eventually intensified enough to be upgraded to a tropical storm, which was named Dean by the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center.|$|E
5|$|After {{weakening}} to a Category1 hurricane on September30, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center {{noted that}} very cold cloud tops still existed, though IR imagery {{indicated that the}} convection and circulation associated with the storm was becoming asymmetrical. Isaac remained a Category1 hurricane for almost 24hours, at which time the storm began to accelerate east-northeastward. Early on October1, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center noted that minimal deep convection persisted near the center {{and much of it}} was displaced to the north. Mid-level dry air and low-level cold air began entering the western quadrant of the storm, which caused it to begin its extratropical transition. By 0600UTC on October1, Isaac weakened to a tropical storm. The <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center noted that further weakening would be slow, due to the large wind field associated with the storm. At 1500UTC on October1, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center issued its final advisory on the storm; Isaac fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about three hours later, while located about halfway between Newfoundland and the Azores. The extratropical remnants tracked rapidly east-northeastward and affected the British Isles on October3 and October4, eventually merging with another extratropical low while north of Scotland early on October4.|$|E

5|$|Fourteen hours {{prior to}} Edith making {{landfall}} in Central America, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center warned citizens about the extreme {{danger of the}} approaching hurricane, {{and asked them to}} prepare for hurricane conditions. While the storm was located in the Gulf of Mexico, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center issued a Hurricane Warning from Cameron to Morgan City, Louisiana eighteen hours before the hurricane made landfall. Edith later struck land in the middle portion of the warning area.|$|E
5|$|In Bermuda, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch on August 5. The hurricane watch was later {{changed to a}} hurricane warning the following day.

5|$|Later on September22, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center began {{noting the}} {{possibility}} of increasing wind shear due to a large upper trough. Despite this, the intensity predictions did not forecast weakening within the next three days. Isaac continued to strengthen and reached hurricane status at 1200UTC on September23. However, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center did not operationally upgrade Isaac until 2100UTC on September23, at which time the storm was a Category2 hurricane. Thereafter, Isaac significantly intensified, and on the following day, it reached an initial peak intensity with winds of 120mph (205km/h). The <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center then predicted Isaac would become a Category4 hurricane on September25, though this did not materialize.|$|E
5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa, on September7. The system passed south of Cape Verde on September8, with disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Around that time, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center gave the system a medium chance of tropical cyclogenesis within 48hours. A low pressure area developed along the axis of the tropical wave on September9, which caused convective activity to increase further. The system was assessed with a high chance for tropical cyclone formation on September10. Based on satellite intensity estimates, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center declared the disturbance as Tropical Depression Fourteen at 1200UTC on September10, while located about 885miles (1,425km) west of Cape Verde.|$|E
5|$|At 0000UTC on September20, the {{depression}} made landfall near Punta Cabezas, Nicaragua with winds of 35mph (55km/h) and weakening was immediately forecast. Three hours later, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center issued its final advisory, as {{the lower level}} center became poorly defined because of interaction with the mountains of Central America and deep thunderstorm activity had significantly diminished. The <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center noted the possibility of regeneration, if the circulation entered into the Pacific Ocean within a few days. Although {{the depression}} never redeveloped, the remnant tropical wave emerged into the Pacific Ocean {{and contributed to the}} development of Hurricane Juliette on September21.|$|E

5|$|By 1500UTC on September 27, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center {{declared}} Bonnie extratropical, {{since it}} was losing tropical characteristics. Bonnie re-acquired tropical characteristics, and the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center resumed advisories on the storm by 2100UTC on September 28. However, post-analysis indicated that Bonnie remained tropical during that time period. Bonnie re-strengthened to a strong tropical storm before vertical wind shear weakened it while approaching the Azores. Shortly before becoming extratropical on September 30, Bonnie passed through the Azores as a moderately weak tropical storm. One location in the Azores reported tropical storm force winds. In addition, one man {{was killed by a}} rock fall on the island of São Miguel. No damage was reported in association with Bonnie.|$|E
5|$|By 4 {{days before}} Isabel made landfall, most {{computer}} models predicted Isabel {{to make landfall}} between North Carolina and New Jersey, and the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center consistently forecast a landfall on North Carolina. Initially, forecasters predicted a landfall in the northeastern portion of the state, though as the hurricane neared land the predicted landfall position was much closer to where it ultimately was. From three days in advance, the average track forecast error for its landfall was only 36miles (58km), and for 48hours in advance the average track error was 18miles (29km). Strong confidence in Isabel's final landfall prompted the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center to issue a hurricane watch for the entire North Carolina coastline about 50hours before Isabel struck land. 38hours before the hurricane made landfall, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the landfall area. The Newport Weather Forecast Office issued a flood potential statement two days before landfall, which indicated a threat for flash flooding. The office began preparing for the hurricane one week before landfall, and brought additional staff members to assist with hurricane related duties.|$|E
5|$|Information is sparse for {{earlier years}} due to {{limitations}} in tropical cyclone observation, though as coastlines became more populated, more data became available.

5|$|On September 9, about 16hours before Florence made landfall, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch from Port Arthur, Texas to Pensacola, Florida. Three hours later, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning from Pensacola to Cameron, Louisiana, with {{a tropical storm}} warning issued from Pensacola eastward to Apalachicola, Florida. Around the time of Florence moving ashore, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center limited the hurricane warning from Pensacola, Florida to Morgan City, Louisiana. Hours after the hurricane made landfall, the warning {{was replaced by a}} tropical storm warning from Mobile, Alabama to Grand Isle, Louisiana, which was discontinued two hours later.|$|E
5|$|Operationally Erika {{was never}} {{upgraded}} to hurricane status. Based on a persistent eye feature on radar and Doppler weather radar-estimated surface winds of 75mph (120km/h), the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center posthumously upgraded Erika to a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} storm formed, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center issued a {{tropical}} storm watch from {{the southern end of}} Galveston Island to Morgan City, Louisiana. As a more northward motion occurred, the watch was canceled and replaced with a tropical storm warning from High Island, Texas, to Pascagoula, Mississippi. Shortly before the storm made landfall, the warning was discontinued between High Island and Cameron, Louisiana. The <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center briefly issued a hurricane watch from Intracoastal City to Morgan City, but it was discontinued when Tropical Storm Bill failed to strengthen. Prior the storm making landfall, local National Weather Service offices issued flash flood watches and a tornado watch for large portions of the Gulf Coast.|$|E
50|$|According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the <b>national</b> {{impact of}} <b>Hurricane</b> Katrina on Gulf Coast crops was minimal, {{with most of}} the damage borne by minor {{producers}} of major crops (corn, soybeans, and cotton). The main impact of the storm on agriculture is likely to involve ocean shipping and exports. In 2004, 22% of U.S. wheat exports, 71% of corn exports, and 65% of soybean exports passed through Gulf ports. Shipping did not occur until later in the fall, when ports would again be operational.|$|R

5|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center {{stated in}} its {{forecast}} on September3 that Gabrielle had a 10percent chance of affecting the Leeward Islands in three days. On September5, meteorologists forecast the storm to bypass {{north of the}} Virgin Islands and told the press {{that it is too}} early to suggest that the storm might hit the United States four or five days ahead of its current position. As Hurricane Gabrielle moved west-northwest, forecasters at the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center advised residents along the East Coast of the United States to monitor the storm because of its large size and strong swells it is producing. When Gabrielle, recurved northwestward, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center forecast the outer edge of the hurricane to graze Bermuda, bringing tropical storm force winds and strong waves to the island. In Bermuda, cruise ships and other water craft were advised of rough seas and many residents rushed to stores to buy emergency supplies.|$|E
