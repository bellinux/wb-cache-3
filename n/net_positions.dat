40|$|This thesis {{contains}} three {{essays on}} mathematical finance. The first discusses approximation methods for pricing swaptions based on moment expansions with multi-factor affine jump-diffusion models in Chapter 2. Two methods are examined. One {{is based on}} a Gram-Charlier expansion and the other {{is based on a}} generalized Edgeworth expansion. The density function of the forward swap is replaced with more tractable functions and their moments. Numerical simulations are conducted to confirm their accuracy. Models with a Gaussian-type or CIR-type volatility with an exponentially, normally or truncated normally distributed jump size are employed. The second essay proposes a framework to study the spot and forward relationship in carbon allowances markets and the third deals with the same problem in a different setting. The framework is based on the no-arbitrage principle. The value of the spot price depends on two underlying variables: the forward price and the <b>net</b> <b>position</b> of the zone defined as the difference between allocated carbon allowances and emissions. In Chapter 3, the <b>net</b> <b>position</b> of the market is modelled as a Markov chain and in Chapter 4, as a linear diffusion. Two kinds of filtration used in pricing are considered: complete information where market participants observe both processes continuously and incomplete information where they observe the forward price continuously and the <b>net</b> <b>position</b> of the zone periodically. Pricing problems occur in an incomplete market, since the <b>net</b> <b>position</b> of the zone is not tradable. A locally risk-minimization approach is used to fix the martingale measure. Under the complete information setting, The analytical spot price is obtained. Under the incomplete information setting, a filtered process is used for pricing, leading to the use of filtering theory. The spot price is computed numerically. Chapter 5 concludes...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to gather some {{evidence}} {{about the relationship between}} crude prices and speculation in oil futures and options markets focusing on WTI markets. In order to shed some light on this link, a brief characterization of what a speculative bubble is and how it works is given. It is also shown that the major reason behind the great inflow of capital into oil derivatives markets is that they became much more attractive to investors than other financial markets (i. e. stocks and bonds) between 2000 and 2007. The reasoning behind the speculative bubble argument is stated and a brief discussion about the strategies commercials and non-commercials adopted in WTI futures and options markets during 1995 - 2007 period is made.

40|$|This study {{gives an}} insight into the {{behaviour}} and performance of large speculators and large hedgers in 29 US futures markets. Using a trading determinant model and priced risk factors such as <b>net</b> <b>positions</b> and sentiment index, results suggest hedgers (speculators) exhibit significant positive feedback trading in 15 (7) markets. Information variables like the S&P 500 index dividend yield, corporate yield spread and the three months treasury bill rate were mostly unimportant in large players’ trading decisions. Hedgers had better market timing abilities than speculators in judging {{the direction of the}} market in one month. The poor market timing abilities and poor significance of positive feedback results suggest higher trading frequency intervals for speculators. Hedging pressures, which measure the presence of risk premium in futures markets, were insignificant mostly in agricultural markets. As a robust test of hedging pressures, price pressure tests found risk premium to be still significant for silver, crude oil and live cattle. The positive feedback behaviour and negative market timing abilities suggest hedgers in heating oil and Japanese yen destabilize futures prices, and points to a need to check CFTC’s (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) position limits regulation in these markets. In fact, large hedgers in these two markets {{are more likely to be}} leading behaviour, in that they have more absolute <b>net</b> <b>positions</b> than speculators. Alternatively stated, positive feedback hedgers in these two markets are more likely to lead institutions and investors to buy (sell) overpriced (underpriced) contracts, eventually leading to divergence of prices away from fundamentals. Atlhought hedgers in crude oil had significant positive feedback behaviour and negative market timing skills, they would not have much of a destabilizing effect over remaining players because the mean <b>net</b> <b>positions</b> of hedgers and speculators were not far apart. While the results are statistically significant, it is suggested these could be economically significant, in that there have been no regulation on position limits at all for hedgers compared to speculators who are imposed with strict limits from the CFTC. Further, mean equations were regressed against decomposed variables, to see how much of the futures returns are attributed to expected components of variables such as <b>net</b> <b>positions,</b> sentiment and information variables. While the expected components of variables are derived by ensuring there are enough ARMA (autoregressive and moving average) terms to make them statistically and economically reliable, the unexpected components of variables measure the residual on differences of the series from its mean. When decomposing <b>net</b> <b>positions</b> against returns, it was found expected <b>net</b> <b>positions</b> to be negatively related to hedgers’ returns in mostly agricultural markets. Speculators’ expected (unexpected) positions were less (more) significant in explaining actual returns, suggesting hedgers are more prone in setting an expected net position at the start of the trading month to determine actual returns rather than readjusting their <b>net</b> <b>positions</b> frequently all throughout the remaining days of the month. While it important to see how futures returns are determined by expected and unexpected values, it is also essential to see how volatility is affected as well. In an attempt to cover three broad types of volatility measures, idiosyncratic volatility, GARCH based volatility (variance based), and PARCH based volatility (standard deviation) are used. <b>Net</b> <b>positions</b> of hedgers (expected and unexpected) tend to have less effect on idiosyncratic volatility than speculators that tended to add to volatility, reinforcing that hedgers trading activity hardly affect the volatility in their returns. This suggest they are better informed by having a better control over their risk (volatility) measures. The GARCH model showed more reliance of news of volatility from previous month in speculators’ volatility. Hedgers’ and speculators’ volatility had a tendency to decay over time except for hedgers’ volatility in Treasury bonds and coffee, and gold and S&P 500 for speculators’ volatility. The PARCH model exhibited more negative components in explaining current volatility. Only in crude oil, heating oil and wheat (Chicago) were idiosyncratic volatility positively related to return, reinforcing the suggestion for stringent regulation in the heating oil market. Expected idiosyncratic volatility was lower (higher) for hedgers (speculators) as expected under portfolio theory. Markets where variance or standard deviation are smaller than those of speculators support the price insurance theory where hedging enables traders to insure against the risk of price fluctuations. Where variance or standard deviation of hedgers is greater than speculators, this suggest the motivation to use futures contracts not primarily to reduce risk, but by institutional characteristics of the futures exchanges like regulation ensuring liquidity. Results were also supportive that there was higher fluctuations in currency and financial markets due to the higher number of contracts traded and players present. Further, the four models (GARCH normal, GARCH t, PARCH normal and PARCH t) showed returns were leptokurtic. The PARCH model, under normal distribution, produced the best forecast of one-month return in ten markets. Standard deviation and variance for both hedgers’ and speculators’ results were mixed, explained by a desire to reduce risk or other institutional characteristics like regulation ensuring liquidity. Moreover, idiosyncratic volatility failed to accurately forecast the risk (standard deviation or variance based) that provided a good forecast of one-month return. This supports not only the superiority of ARCH based models over models that assume equally weighted average of past squared residuals, but also the presence of time varying volatility in futures prices time series. The last section of the study involved a stability and events analysis, using recursive estimation methods. The trading determinant model, mean equation model, return and risk model, trading activity model and volatility models were all found to be stable following the effect of major global economic events of the 1990 s. Models with risk being proxied as standard deviation showed more structural breaks than where variance was used. Overall, major macroeconomic events didn’t have any significant effect upon the large hedgers’ and speculators’ behaviour and performance over the last decade...|$|E
