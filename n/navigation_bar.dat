Rather, on selecting the category in the left pane, the contents appear on the right, in a graphical manner with thumbnails—a departure from textual presentation of information. Missing album art can be added directly to the placeholders in the Library itself (though the program re-renders all album art imported this way into 1:1 pixel ratio, 200x200 resolution JPEG images). Views for Music, Pictures, Video and Recorded TV are separate and can be chosen individually from the <b>navigation</b> <b>bar.</b> Entries for Pictures and Video show their thumbnails.

40|$|Understanding {{what are}} the regions of a webpage and the {{functions}} of those regions is important for many services over web pages, including screen readers, web search, and assessing web-page similarity. In this thesis, we present an approach to identify the regions of a webpage based on image processing techniques and to identify the portions of the DOM tree corresponding to these regions. We then present and compare a rule-based approach and a SVM-based approach using the visual and markup information to classify regions based on their roles. A corpus of 150 web pages exhibiting {{a wide variety of}} designs was collected. Each page was provided human-assigned regions and their roles to use in training and for evaluating results. The segmentation algorithm accurately identified 77. 8 % of the 1222 web page regions in the corpus but its performance was not even across different types of regions. Segmentation accuracy was above 80 % for headers, footers, body regions, and top <b>navigation</b> <b>bars.</b> The algorithm had more difficulty with left, right, and bottom <b>navigation</b> <b>bars</b> and dynamic content, having lower than 70 % accuracy for locating these segments. The correctly segmented web page components were used as a test collection to compare the rule-based and SVM-based approach to assigning the role of each segment. The SVM-based and the rule-based approach both achieved between 74 and 75 % accuracy over 951 classifications. The SVM-based approach was better at classifying left and bottom <b>navigation</b> <b>bars</b> while the rule-based approach did better at recognizing dynamic content. Moreover, an accuracy of 81. 3 % is obtained when we used both the methods to identify regions correctly. In this case, we considered a region correctly identified if the region is identified correctly either by the rule-based or SVM-based method. Overall, these results are promising for incorporating these segmentation and segment role classifications into web services...|$|R

While Expression Web {{serves as the}} full-featured successor to FrontPage, SharePoint Designer focuses on designing and customizing Microsoft SharePoint websites.

The first version, SharePoint Designer 2007, retains more FrontPage features than Expression Web (such as web components, database, marquee, hit counter, <b>navigation</b> <b>bars</b> and map insert). SharePoint Designer 2007 was initially a commercial software product. On March 31, 2009, however, SharePoint Designer 2007 was made available as freeware.|$|R

This paper applies the DUIS approach which was initially developed for area features to linear features. Moreover, we enhance the DUIS approach with new tools to navigate within embedded texts: The sidebar, the information petals and <b>navigation</b> <b>bars.</b> These tools provide the context {{as well as the}} structure of the entire textual information space at a glance thereby reducing the cognitive overheads associated with navigating within large texts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Web data {{analysis}} {{applications such as}} extracting mutual funds information from a website, daily extracting opening and closing price of stock from a web page involves web data extraction. Every time you need analyze data, you need to visit number of web sites. It is very time consuming process to construct wrapper to visit those sites and collect data. In this paper, we propose technique called DEUDS, a page level data extraction system that automatically discovers extraction pattern from web pages for selected data section and extracts data. DEUDS uses visual cues to identify data records while ignoring noise items such as advertises and <b>navigation</b> <b>bars...</b>|$|R
2500|$|For devices with screens 128 pixels wide or smaller, {{the default}} {{rendering}} mode is Small-Screen Rendering (SSR). In this mode, the page is reformatted {{into a single}} vertical column so that it need only be scrolled vertically. Long lists and <b>navigation</b> <b>bars</b> are automatically collapsed (hiding most of the list or bar) by a feature known as [...] "content folding". A plus (+) sign is displayed next to the collapsed content; when clicked, it toggles content folding. Web developers can turn on SSR on the desktop edition of Opera to see how their websites will be displayed on mobile editions of Opera. In SSR mode images are scaled down {{to no more than}} 70% of the screen size in either direction.|$|R

Current tools, however, {{are limited in}} the size and complexity of interaction that can be specified. We have created an advanced sketchbased visual language that allows for easy prototyping of large, complex interactive designs. In its current embodiment in the DENIM web design tool, the visual language allows designers to sketch reusable components for recurring page elements, such as <b>navigation</b> <b>bars,</b> as well as conditionals to illustrate and test transitions that depend on a user’s input. Designers can also specify sites that accept richer user input than simple clicking. Our informal evaluation shows that these features allow designers with little programming experience to quickly create prototypes of large, complex web sites while still working inside an informal, sketch-based environment...|$|R

40|$|An {{existing}} {{car wash}} user interface was evaluated and redesigned to improve novice and experienced-user performance by implementing human factors methods.

Results revealed five areas of difficulty within the existing system: organization, visibility, visual distractions, system feedback, and error correction. Researchers generated design strategies to mitigate the aforementioned areas of difficulty, and incorporated them into prototype iterations. A/B usability testing was conducted with the prototype iterations to compare novice and experienced-user performance with horizontal and vertical <b>navigation</b> <b>bars</b> containing and excluding price information. Results indicated that overall the revised system was a success, with the horizontal no price iteration being most effective.
