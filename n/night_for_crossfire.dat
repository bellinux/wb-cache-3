50|$|Some {{motherboards}} {{have two}} or more PCI-E 16x slots, to allow more than 2 monitors without special hardware, or use a special graphics technology called SLI (<b>for</b> Nvidia) and <b>Crossfire</b> (<b>for</b> AMD). These allow 2 to 4 graphics cards to be linked together, to allow better performance in intensive graphical computing tasks, such as gaming, video editing, etc.|$|R
50|$|Radeon Graphics is the {{successor}} to the Rage line. Three different families of microarchitectures can be roughly distinguished, the fixed-pipeline family, the unified shader model-families of TeraScale and Graphics Core Next. ATI/AMD have developed different technologies, such as TruForm, HyperMemory, HyperZ, XGP, Eyefinity for multi-monitor setups, PowerPlay <b>for</b> power-saving, <b>CrossFire</b> (<b>for</b> multi-GPU) or Hybrid Graphics. A range of SIP blocks is also to be found on certain models in the Radeon products line: Unified Video Decoder, Video Coding Engine and TrueAudio.|$|R

50|$|Grahame {{began her}} acting career in theatre, and in 1944 made her first film for MGM. Despite a {{featured}} role in It's a Wonderful Life (1946), MGM {{did not believe}} she had the potential for major success, and sold her contract to RKO Studios. Often cast in film noir projects, Grahame received a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress <b>for</b> <b>Crossfire</b> (1947), and she won this award for her work in The Bad and the Beautiful (1952). She achieved her highest profile with Sudden Fear (1952), Human Desire (1953), The Big Heat (1953), and Oklahoma! (1955), but her film career began to wane soon afterwards.|$|R
50|$|Violence can {{induce a}} hot zone, as {{occupants}} {{are subject to}} attacks, crossfire, or even direct fire targeted at them specifically. The most identifiable violent hot zones are in war zones, such as the war in Afghanistan. Soldiers are constantly fighting with other soldiers and insurgents to attempt to accomplish tactical goals. Hot zones are not good places to appear {{as a member of}} either of the opposing teams, because one may be prone to attacks or capture. Although war zones may have the most targeted attacks, crime ridden neighborhoods are the most common areas <b>for</b> <b>crossfire</b> to occur, and subsequently the most victims of crossfire are here.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 1974, {{the maximum}} speed limit on Tennessee's Interstate {{highways}} was 75 mph day or <b>night</b> <b>for</b> cars and 65 mph day or <b>night</b> <b>for</b> trucks. Other rural highways had a maximum speed limit of 65 mph day and 55 mph <b>night</b> <b>for</b> cars and 50 mph day or <b>night</b> <b>for</b> trucks. Many of these other class roadways also had separate day and night speed limits as well.|$|R

5000|$|SLI {{does not}} always give a {{performance}} benefit - in some extreme cases, it can lower the frame rate due to the particulars of an application's coding. This is also true <b>for</b> AMD's <b>CrossFire,</b> as the problem is inherent in multi-GPU systems. This is often witnessed when running an application at low resolutions.|$|R
50|$|With {{the release}} of the Radeon X1950 Pro (RV570 GPU), ATI has {{completely}} revised CrossFire's connection infrastructure to further eliminate the need for past Y-dongle/Master card and slave card configurations <b>for</b> <b>CrossFire</b> to operate. ATI's CrossFire connector is now a ribbon-like connector attached to the top of each graphics adapter, similar to nVidia's SLI bridges, but different in physical and logical natures. As such, Master Cards no longer exist, and are not required for maximum performance. Two dongles can be used per card; these were put to full use with {{the release of}} CrossFireX. Radeon HD 2900 and HD 3000 series cards use the same ribbon connectors, but the HD 3800 series of cards only require one ribbon connector, to facilitate CrossFireX. Unlike older series of Radeon cards, different HD 3800 series cards can be combined in CrossFire, each with separate clock control.|$|R
