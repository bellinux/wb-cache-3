Although various localization algorithms have been proposed recently, most of them require nodes be equipped with range-determining hardware to obtain distance information. In this paper, we propose a concentric anchor-beacons (CAB) localization algorithm for wireless sensor <b>networks.</b> <b>CAB</b> is a range-free approach and uses {{a small number of}} anchor nodes. Each anchor emits beacons at different power levels. From the information received by each beacon heard, nodes determine which annular ring they are located within each anchor. Each node uses the approximated center of intersection of the rings as its position estimate. Simulation results show that the estimation error reduces by half when anchors transmit beacons at two different power levels instead of at a single level. CAB also gives a lower estimation error than other range-free localization schemes (e. g., Centroid, APIT) when the anchor-to-node range ratio is less than four. I...|$|R

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Through {{observations}} from real life hub networks, we introduce the multimodal hub location and hub network design problem. We approach the hub location problem from a network design perspective. In {{addition to the}} location and allocation decisions, we also study the decision on how the hub networks with different possible transportation modes must be designed. In this multimodal hub location and hub network design problem, we jointly consider transportation costs and travel times, which are studied separately in most hub location problems presented in the literature. We allow different transportation modes between hubs and different types of service time promises between origin–destination pairs while designing the hub network in the multimodal problem. We first propose a linear mixed integer programming model for this problem and then derive variants of the problem that might arise in certain applications. The models are enhanced via a set of effective valid inequalities and an efficient heuristic is developed. Computational analyses are presented on the various instances from the Turkish <b>network</b> and <b>CAB</b> data set...|$|R

This manuscript version is made available under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4. 0 license [URL] this study, we allow using alternative transportation modes and different types of vehicles in the hub networks to be designed. The aim {{of the problem is}} to determine the locations and capacities of hubs, which transportation modes to serve at hubs, allocation of non-hub nodes to hubs, and the number of vehicles of each type to operate on the hub network to route the demand between origin-destination pairs with minimum total cost. Total cost includes fixed costs of establishing hubs with different capacities, purchasing and operational costs of vehicles, transportation costs, and material handling costs. A mixed-integer programming model is developed and a variable neighborhood search algorithm is proposed for the solution of this problem. The heuristic algorithm is tested on instances from the Turkish <b>network</b> and <b>CAB</b> data set. Extensive computational analyzes are conducted in order to observe the effects of changes in various problem parameters on the resulting hub networks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Hubs are {{facilities}} that consolidate and disseminate flow in many-to-many distribution systems. The hub location problem considers decisions {{that include the}} locations of hubs in a network and also the allocations of the demand (non-hub) nodes to these hubs. We propose a hierarchical multimodal hub network. Based on this network, we define a hub covering problem with a service time bound. The hierarchical network consists of three layers. We consider two different structures: ring-star-star (RSS) and ring-ring-star (RRS). The multimodal network has three different types of vehicles in each layer: airplanes, large trucks and small trucks. For the proposed problems (RSS and RRS), we present and strengthen two mathematical models with some variable fixing rules and valid inequalities. We conduct the computational analysis over the Turkish <b>network</b> and the <b>CAB</b> data sets...|$|R
40|$|Location {{data can}} be {{extremely}} useful to study commuting patterns and disruptions, {{as well as to}} predict real-time traffic volumes. At the same time, however, the fine-grained collection of user locations raises serious privacy concerns, as this can reveal sensitive information about the users, such as, life style, political and religious inclinations, or even identities. In this paper, we study the feasibility of crowd-sourced mobility analytics over aggregate location information: users periodically report their location, using a privacy-preserving aggregation protocol, so that the server can only recover aggregates [...] i. e., how many, but not which, users are in a region at a given time. We experiment with real-world mobility datasets obtained from the Transport For London authority and the San Francisco <b>Cabs</b> <b>network,</b> and present a novel methodology based on time series modeling that is geared to forecast traffic volumes in regions of interest and to detect mobility anomalies in them. In the presence of anomalies, we also make enhanced traffic volume predictions by feeding our model with additional information from correlated regions. Finally, we present and evaluate a mobile app prototype, called Mobility Data Donors (MDD), in terms of computation, communication, and energy overhead, demonstrating the real-world deployability of our techniques.

40|$|Introduction: Welfare {{advice is}} {{suggested}} to improve people’s health through {{action on the}} wider determinants of health and reducing stress and anxiety. However, due to the distal nature of health outcomes, and as advice services are highly tailored and nested in a wider system of health provision, evidencing the potential health impact of advice services has proven difficult. Methods: A realist evaluation will test if, how, for whom and in what circumstances an intensive programme for clients with complex needs provided by the Citizens Advice Bureau impacts on various socio-economic determinants of health. Sixteen initial programme theories were developed based on the advice service literature and interviews with staff from the citizen’s advice bureau who deliver the programme. Theoretical literature was used to support theory development, where empirical evidence was not available. The programme theories were tested using a mixed methods design in phase 2 of the research, using questionnaire data and realist interviews with staff and clients. Findings: We describe three emerging findings: (1) 	Formal brief health interventions were often not used by case workers, who instead provided health advice through anecdotes and personal experience (resource). This was due to health interventions sometimes being perceived as intrusive and ‘preaching’. CAB case workers felt that they weren’t medically trained and therefore health interventions were not within their remit (context). The use of anecdotes avoided clients feeling judged for their health behaviour (reasoning) and resulted in them being more receptive to health information and engaged in discussions (outcome). This allowed case workers to retain {{the trust of the}} clients whilst still delivering health advice. (2) 	One route to health impact as a result of CAB advice and increased finances may be a reduction in social isolation. Often clients are socially isolated due to low income (context) which is increased after advice from CAB (resource). This prompted a decision by clients to engage in social activities they may have previously not been able to (reasoning), resulting in increased wellbeing (outcome). (3) 	In the context of a distrust of agents of the state (context 1) and/or where clients have a weak social support <b>network</b> (context 2) <b>CAB</b> acts as a ‘person of standing’ offering impartial and non-judgemental services (resource). This allows clients to feel supported and develop trust (reasoning). This results in a buffer between the person and the state (outcome 1) which allows access to benefits (outcome 2), less stress and anxiety (outcome 3) and potential re-referrals for longer standing issues related to health (such as counselling) (outcome 3). Conclusions: Emerging findings are beginning to make explicit the mechanisms through and contexts within which intensive advice services may impact on health. Although the chain of causality is likely to be long and convoluted, early findings suggest that key steps in the process seem to be trust development, engagement and stress reduction. Another pivotal factor in identifying health outcomes in this project is to take a broader definition of health which includes decreased social isolation and increased wellbeing...|$|R
