A preliminary simplification of the list was achieved by categorization and ranking of the chemically oriented environments into chemical families. Further ranking and priorization of the pertinent environmental factors (and factor combinations) is recommended using such tools as failure mode effects critically analysis (FMECA) and fault tree analysis (FTA). Other key environmental factors addressed include installation and operational factors.

30|$|This study {{develops}} a bottom-up model to quantitatively assess the comprehensive effects of replacing traditional petroleum-powered <b>vehicles</b> with <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles</b> (NGVs) in China {{based on an}} investigation of the direct energy consumption and critical air pollutant (CAP) emission intensity, life-cycle energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity of NGV fleets. The results indicate that, on average, there are no net energy savings from replacing a traditional <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicle</b> with an NGV. Interestingly, an NGV results in significant reductions in direct CAP and life-cycle GHG emissions compared to those of a traditional <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicle,</b> ranging from 61 % to 76 % and 12 % to 29 %, respectively. Due to the increasing use of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> as a <b>vehicle</b> <b>fuel</b> in China (i.e. approximately 28.2 billion cubic metres of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in 2015), the total petroleum substituted with <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> was approximately 23.8 million tonnes (Mt), which generated a GHG emission reduction of 16.9 Mt of CO 2 equivalent and a CAP emission reduction of 1.8 Mt in 2015. Given the significant contribution of NGVs, growing the NGV population in 2020 will further increase the petroleum substitution benefits and CAP and GHG emission reduction benefits by approximately 42.5 Mt of petroleum-based fuel, 3.1 Mt of CAPs and 28.0 Mt of GHGs.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate development of a low-cost liquid <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> (LNG) <b>vehicle</b> <b>fuel</b> storage tank with low fuel boil-off, low tank pressure, and high safety margin. One of the largest contributors to the cost of converting a vehicle to LNG is the cost of the LNG fuel tank. To minimize heat leak from the surroundings into the low-temperature fuel, these tanks are designed as cryogenic dewars with double walls separated by an evacuated insulation space containing multi-layer insulation. The cost of these fuel tanks is driven by this double-walled construction, both in terms of materials and labor. The primary focus of the analysis was to try to devise a fuel tank concept that would allow for the elimination of the double-wall requirement. Results of this study have validated the benefit of vacuum/MLI insulation for LNG fuel tanks and the difficulty in identifying viable alternatives. The thickness of a non-vacuum insulation layer would have to be unreasonably large to achieve an acceptable non-venting hold time. Reasonable hold times could be achieved by using an auxiliary tank to accept boil-off vapor from a non-vacuum insulated primary tank, if the vapor in the auxiliary tank can be stored at high pressure. The primary focus of the analysis was to try to devise a fuel tank concept that allowed for the elimination of the double-wall requirement. Thermodynamic relations were developed for analyzing the fuel tank transient response to heat transfer, venting of vapor, and out-flow of either vapor or liquid. One of the major costs associated with conversion of a <b>vehicle</b> to LNG <b>fuel</b> is the cost of the LNG fuel tank.

In November 2010, EPA introduced MPGe as comparison metric on its new sticker for fuel economy for the Nissan Leaf and the Chevrolet Volt.In May 2011, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and EPA issued a joint final rule establishing new requirements for a fuel economy and environment label that is mandatory for all new passenger cars and trucks starting with model year 2013. The ruling includes new labels for alternative fuel and alternative propulsion vehicles available in the US market, such as plug-in hybrids, electric vehicles, flexible-fuel <b>vehicles,</b> hydrogen <b>fuel</b> cell <b>vehicle,</b> and <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The common <b>fuel</b> economy metric adopted to allow the comparison of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles is miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent (MPGe). A gallon of gasoline equivalent means the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity, cubic feet of compressed <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> (CNG), or kilograms of hydrogen that is equal to the energy in a gallon of gasoline.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the performance of multi-transition metal (Cu, Cr, Ni and Co) ions exchanged zeolite 13 X catalysts on methane emission abatement, especially at methane level of the exhaust from <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>fueled</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Catalytic activity of methane combustion using multi-ions exchanged catalyst was studied under different parameters: mole % of metal loading, inlet velocity and inlet methane concentration at atmospheric pressure and 500 °C. Performance of the catalysts was investigated and {{explained in terms of}} the apparent activation energy, number of active sites and BET surface area of the catalyst. This study showed that the multi-ions exchanged catalyst outperformed the single-ions exchanged and the acidified 13 X catalysts. Lengthening the residence time could also lead to higher methane conversion %. Catalytic activity of the catalysts was influenced by the mole % of metal loading which played important roles in affecting the apparent activation energy of methane combustion, active sites and also the BET surface area of the catalyst. Increasing mole % of metal loading in the catalyst decreased the apparent activation energy for methane combustion and also the BET surface area of the catalyst. In view of these, there existed an optimized mole % of metal loading where the highest catalytic activity was observed. Copyright © 2007 by ASME...|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> as a <b>vehicle</b> <b>fuel</b> has {{benefits}} over petroleum-based fuels {{in reducing}} the primary emission of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and particulate matter (PM). The objective {{of this research was}} to provide information concerning the relative PM forming potential of exhaust emissions from <b>vehicles</b> <b>fueled</b> with <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> compared with that from gasoline and diesel-fueled vehicles. A dualreactor, large (~ 20 m 3 each) indoor environmental chamber was constructed to allow for growth and measurement under controlled conditions simulating the atmosphere. A chassis dynamometer facility was used to generate and characterize exhausts from a <b>natural</b> <b>gas,</b> a gasoline, and from a diesel-fueled <b>vehicle.</b> The exhaust <b>gases</b> were added to propene - NO x - air mixtures to simulate gas-phase pollutants from other sources in polluted urban atmospheres. Cold-start exhaust was injected into one reactor and hot start exhaust from the same vehicle was injected into the other, and the two mixtures were irradiated with blacklights for 4 - 6 hours, with gas-phase species measured before and during the irradiations. A Differential Mobility Analyzer (DMA) was used to obtain particle number and volume information throughout the experiments, and the final aerosol mass was also determined by passing the contents of the reactors through filters which were weighed {{at the end of the}} experiments. Significant small particle formation was observed in control experiments due to nucleation by background contaminants, which prevented quantitative particle growth information to be obtained from the DMA data. The particle mass emitted or formed from the <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>vehicle</b> was found to be not significantly different from the control experiments, while significantly higher particle mass was form [...] ...|$|R
30|$|Our {{findings}} indicate that on average, there are no net energy savings from replacing a traditional <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicle</b> with an NGV. Therefore, appropriate measures {{need to be taken}} to improve transportation system efficiency based on the resources consumed. Interestingly, an NG-powered vehicle results in significant direct CAP and life-cycle GHG emissions reductions compared to that of a traditional <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicle,</b> ranging from 61 % to 76 % and ranging from 12 % to 29 %, respectively. An NGV results in significant reductions in petroleum consumption compared to a gasoline/diesel vehicle, ranging from 1.2 to 8.9 tonnes and 20.3 – 40.8 tonnes, respectively. Due to the increasing use of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> as a <b>vehicle</b> <b>fuel</b> in China (i.e. approximately 28.2 billion cubic metres of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in 2015), the total gasoline/diesel fuel substituted with <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> was approximately 23.8 Mt, which generated a GHG emissions reduction of 16.9 Mt of CO 2 equivalent and a CAP emissions reduction of 1.8 Mt in 2015. Given the significant contribution of NGVs, growing the NGV population in 2020 will further increase the petroleum substitution benefits and CAP and GHG emissions reduction benefits by approximately 3.1 Mt of CAPs and 28.0 Mt of GHGs, respectively. By 2030, these benefits will reach 81.5 Mt of traditional fuel, 5.6 Mt of CAPs and 50.5 Mt of GHGs, representing a significant contribution to energy security and emissions reduction for China. Therefore, China should increase its efforts to promote the use of NGVs to replace traditional <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R
40|$|This report explores {{consumer}} preferences among four different alternative-fuel vehicles (AFVs) : hybrid electric <b>vehicles</b> (HEVs), compressed <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> (CNG) <b>vehicles,</b> hydrogen <b>fuel</b> cell (HFC) <b>vehicles,</b> and electric vehicles (EVs). Although {{researchers have been}} interested in understanding {{consumer preferences}} for AFVs for more than three decades, it is important to update our estimates of the trade-offs people are willing to make between cost, environmental performance, vehicle range, and refuel¬ing convenience. We conducted a nationwide, Internet-based survey to assess consumer preferences for AFVs. Respondents participated in a stated-preference ranking exercise in which they ranked a series of five vehicles (four AFVs and a traditional gasoline-fueled vehicle) that differ primarily in fuel type, price, environmental performance, vehicle range, and refueling conve¬nience. Our findings indicate that, in general, gasoline-fueled vehicles are still preferred over AFVs, however there is a strong interest in AFVs. No AFV type is overwhelmingly preferred, although HEVs seem to have an edge. Using a panel rank-ordered mixed logit model, we assessed the trade-offs people make between key AFV characteristics. We found that, in order to leave a person’s utility unchanged, a $ 1, 000 increase in AFV cost needs to be compensated by either: (1) a $ 300 savings in driving cost over 12, 000 miles; (2) a 17. 5 mile increase in vehicle range; or (3) a 7. 8 -minute decrease in total refueling time (e. g. finding a gas station and refueling) ...|$|R
