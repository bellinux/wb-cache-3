5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{original}} working titles of the film were first The Beatles and then Beatlemania, the group's name is <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> in the movie—it is, however, visible on Ringo's drum kit, on the stage lighting, and on the helicopter in the final scene. The television performance scene also contains a visual pun on the group's name, with photos of beetles visible on the wall behind the dancers.|$|E
5|$|Willard Isenbaum, {{a lonely}} {{insurance}} man with wild sexual fantasies, decides to propose {{to the new}} secretary, Susie, whom he has only known {{for a day and}} to whom he has <b>never</b> <b>spoken.</b> He spends the entire morning before work fantasizing about having sex with her, but his attempts to approach her fail. His female boss sends him to investigate a claim filed by Painless Martha, an aging tattoo artist, who works in a prison. Martha believes in a Ouija board message saying that she will be killed by a wizard on a Tuesday.|$|E

25|$|The {{major theme}} of The Scarlet Letter is shaming and social stigmatizing, both Hester's public humiliation and Dimmesdale's private shame {{and fear of}} exposure. Notably, their liaison is <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> of, so the {{circumstances}} that lead to Hester's pregnancy, and how their affair was kept secret never {{become part of the}} plot.|$|E

Darling's brother Warren, not having seen her in years and unaware {{that she had been}} living as a woman, was said to have been visibly shaken by her feminine appearance.

25|$|Doughty {{grew up in}} Oahu, Hawaii, {{where she}} had no {{exposure}} to death until, at age 8, she witnessed the death of another child in an accident. She was quickly taken {{from the scene of}} the accident and it was <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> of again. For several years, she became obsessed with fears of her own or her family's deaths. Doughty says she could have recovered better from the incident had she been given the opportunity to face the reality of the child's death.|$|E
25|$|Medieval Latin is {{the written}} Latin in use during {{that portion of}} the postclassical period when no {{corresponding}} Latin vernacular existed. The spoken language had developed into the various incipient Romance languages; however, in the educated and official world Latin continued without its natural spoken base. Moreover, this Latin spread into lands that had <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> Latin, such as the Germanic and Slavic nations. It became useful for international communication between the member states of the Holy Roman Empire and its allies.|$|E

25|$|As a child, Steve Jr. {{had heard}} his late father's stories of adventures with Wonder Woman during World War II. It is {{essentially}} confirmed {{in the second}} season première that his father never introduced him to Wonder Woman {{and that he had}} never even seen her photographed. It is similarly implied that he and YN1 Diana Prince were unaware of each other. Diana is taken aback by the younger Steve's existence, implying that his father had <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> of the boy to either Wonder Woman or YN1 Prince. This was particularly striking when she spoke to Steve Jr. about knowing his father well, from the j-shaped burn scar on his right shoulder, to the 20mm shell casing that he used as a paperweight.|$|E
25|$|Falcone {{received}} an effusive congratulatory {{phone call from}} Giulio Andreotti after the narrow escape. Falcone privately thought it odd that Andreotti, who he had <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> to, would suddenly contact him, and he mused {{about the significance of}} the incident to a friend. Unknown to Falcone the efforts to kill him were suspended while the Maxi trial verdicts went through the appeals process that had often set convicted Mafia members free. Later investigations into the murders of two police officers, Antonino Agostino and Emanuele Piazza, who worked for the secret service, revealed that they had secretly defused the bombs that had been placed by a Mafia commando aided by other secret service men. Agostino and his wife were killed on 5 August 1989 outside their home, and Piazza on 15 March 1990.|$|E
25|$|David Blanchflower is the Bruce V Rauner {{professor}} of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, part-time professor at the University of Stirling, a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, and a contributing editor for Bloomberg TV. On September 27, 2015, it was announced that he had been appointed to the British Labour Party's Economic Advisory Committee, convened by Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell and reporting to Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn, for whom he is undertaking an independent review of the Bank of England, although he has stated that he is not a Corbyn supporter and has <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> to him. Blanchflower quit the panel and said he would also wind up his review {{of the role of the}} Bank of England on 28 June 2016 following the mass resignations of the Shadow Cabinet, joining them in calling for Corbyn to step down.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} film, when Gizmo multiplied, his off-spring closely resembled himself, {{except for the}} leader, Stripe. Here, the four mogwai Gizmo {{produces}} each possess their own distinct personalities and physical features. Additionally, each mogwai has a name, although the names {{were used in the}} script and <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> aloud in the film. Two of the mogwais were George, black without a stripe and a caricature of Edward G. Robinson, and Lenny, buck-toothed, named for the principal characters in Of Mice and Men, whom they resemble in both appearance and demeanor. Daffy was named for his manic behaviour, and the leader, Mohawk, for his mohawk hairstyle. Based on the original film's character, Stripe, Frank Welker also voices Mohawk. While both the mogwai and gremlin versions of Stripe had fur stripes, Baker hit upon the idea of giving the Mohawk mogwai a fur stripe and giving the Mohawk gremlin something scalier. Gizmo was also redesigned; the puppet was generally larger and its design was simplified. Dante commented Gizmo may look less real in Gremlins 2, but the result was that Gizmo could convey more emotion.|$|E
500|$|Haywood's {{industrial}} unionism {{was much}} broader than formulating {{a more effective}} method of conducting strikes.

Lucky and Squash decide to run away hoping that, when their owners come rescue them, the two owners will meet, fall in love, and get married, thereby making the dogs [...] "brothers" [...] and allowing them to play together whenever they wish. Lucky and Squash escape from their respective yards three days in a row and go on adventures. The owners do meet and fall in love.|$|E

The celebration derives from Nani's {{background}} in capoeira, which he used to practice as a child.

Nani denounced the reports in August 2007, stating it was [...] "not true" [...] and that [...] "Ferguson has <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> to me about this subject and I am going to continue to celebrate goals in this way.

500|$|The {{two friends}} {{confirmed}} to the Post that they remembered meeting Jackie {{on the night}} of the incident, that she was distraught but not visibly injured or bloodied, and that details she provided then were different from those in the Rolling Stone article. One friend, Ryan Duffin (called [...] "Randall" [...] in the Rolling Stone article), told The Washington Post that he had <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> to any reporter from Rolling Stone, although Erdely had claimed him as a source to corroborate the accuser's story. Sandra Menendez, a student who claimed to have been interviewed by Erdely but who was not directly quoted in the article, told CNN that she and others became uncomfortable after speaking with Erdely, concluding she had [...] "an agenda".|$|E

[...] The song became a subject of some controversy when fans and critics noted connections between its theme and the attacks of September 2001, months after the song's release, which resulted in the FBI investigating Arjona. The singer later commented that [...] "Mesías" [...] had no relationship to the attacks, and that the lyrics were pure coincidence. He further stated the FBI had <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> directly to him, but instead to somebody on his team.|$|E
