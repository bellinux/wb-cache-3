Dr. Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) investigates into his death and whilst investigating, it is {{revealed}} Ted had surgery just before he died, and Megan finds three surgical staples that weren't closed fully, causing him to bleed out internally, causing Megan to think that Ted was murdered. Megan visits her old hospital, where she was once a neurosurgeon. Ted's surgeon, Doctor Chandler (Marc Blucas) {{has a reputation for}} recklessness whilst performing surgeries and Megan finds out that the video was <b>never</b> <b>turned</b> on, meaning the surgery was never recorded. Whilst at the hospital, Megan meets her old friend and the hospital administrator Gwen Baldwin (Carolyn McCormick) and whilst there Gwen reveals her son died of an overdose. Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, Ethan (Geoffrey Arend) and Curtis (Windell Middlebrooks) autopsy Jessica Archer (Christina Hendricks), with both Ethan and Curtis unsure how she died.

25|$|Crawley {{went with}} MCC to the Caribbean {{in the winter}} of 1925-26, {{although}} as West Indies had yet to attain Test status this was not considered a major tour, and he played no first-class games. Upon his return he joined Essex, with whom he remained until the end of his county career. Although he <b>never</b> <b>turned</b> out {{for more than a few}} games each summer, he produced some notable feats of batting, such as the second-innings 176 not out he hit, under pressure of time, to beat Sussex in 1927.|$|E
25|$|Transplant {{recipients}} {{must take}} immunosuppressive anti-rejection drugs {{for as long}} as the transplanted kidney functions. The routine immunosuppressives are tacrolimus (Prograf), mycophenolate (Cellcept), and prednisolone; these drugs cost US$1,500 per month. In 1999 the United States Congress passed a law that restricts Medicare from paying for more than three years for these drugs, unless the patient is otherwise Medicare-eligible. Transplant programs may not transplant a patient unless the patient has a reasonable plan to pay for medication after the Medicare expires; however, patients are almost <b>never</b> <b>turned</b> down for financial reasons alone.

25|$|Although the {{freighting}} business remained brisk and {{the cars}} were a favourite with travelers, they <b>never</b> <b>turned</b> a very large profit for the company. Although private operators could discontinue their services when the road conditions were poor, the BC Express Company had advertised automobile services in all weather conditions from May to October. Fulfilling that promise meant that a large crew of mechanics and drivers had to be kept on staff. In 1913, it cost the company $67,233 to maintain their fleet of 8 Wintons. The largest sum went for repairs, but $15,835.53 was spent on tires alone. Furthermore the total profits that were made that season was only $3,337.23, which the company believed was not a large figure considering the risk and investment involved.|$|E

25|$|Phase I (338–280 BC) was {{dominated}} by the three Samnite Wars, the result {{of which was the}} subjugation of the Romans' main military rival on the peninsula, the Samnite league. The loyalty of the then socii during this period appears to have remained largely solid. There were sporadic revolts: in 315, 306, 269, 264 BC by some Campanian cities, the Aurunci, Hernici and Piceni respectively. But these were isolated cases and <b>never</b> <b>turned</b> into a general revolt of the socii. Most importantly, when in 297–3 Rome faced its gravest threat in this period, a coalition of Samnites and Gauls, the socii of the time did not abandon Rome. At the Battle of Sentinum (295), where a huge combined army of Samnites and Gauls suffered a crushing defeat, the socii contingents actually outnumbered the 18,000 Romans (4 legions deployed).|$|E
25|$|While {{the public}} image of SWAT first became known through the LAPD, {{perhaps because of}} its {{proximity}} to the mass media and the size and professionalism of the Department itself, the first actual SWAT-type operations were conducted north of Los Angeles in the farming community of Delano, California {{on the border between}} Kern and Tulare Counties in the San Joaquin Valley. At the time, the United Farm Workers union led by César Chavez was staging numerous protests in Delano, in a strike that would last over five years. Though the strike <b>never</b> <b>turned</b> violent, the Delano Police Department responded by forming ad-hoc SWAT-type units involving crowd and riot control, sniper skills and surveillance. Television news stations and print media carried live and delayed reportage of these events across the United States. Personnel from the LAPD, having seen these broadcasts, contacted Delano and inquired about the program. One officer then obtained permission to observe the Delano Police Department's special weapons and tactics units in action, and afterwards, he took what he had learned back to Los Angeles, where his knowledge was used and expanded on to form the LAPD's own first SWAT unit.|$|E
25|$|This {{language}} revival had {{exposed the}} Tamils to {{the richness of}} their literature and more than two thousand years of history. It was seen by Tamils that Hindi, an undeveloped language, was being imposed on them. This renaissance, coupled with the new-found awareness of its uniqueness {{when compared to the}} Northern Indian languages, led to suspicion of anything that was Northern. Anti-Brahminism sentiments that had arisen further complicated the antipathy to the North, since it was seen by leaders like Periyar as an import from the North. Periyar and his DK, as did the DK’s predecessor Justice Party, saw the British Raj as the only alternative to Brahmin dominance. The resultant Tamil nationalism had until then not been expressed as violence. Both under the British and in independent India the Tamils have had a somewhat privileged position, since they were much sought after as labour, partly because the standard of education and knowledge of English have been to some extent higher than elsewhere in India; consequently Tamils have secured a large share of appointments in government service and education. Perhaps because of this, Tamil linguistic feelings had <b>never</b> <b>turned</b> against English. As Tamils saw English not as a threat, but a tool for advancement and protection of their interest, replacing English with Hindi, even as a suggestion, provoked violently adverse reactions, in particular, amongst students. Thus the introduction of Hindi as a national language was seen as direct measure of the North to dominate the South culturally, economically, and politically. For them the use of English as an official language meant social equality where a Northerner and a Southerner start at a same point in English.|$|E

25|$|The storyline {{rivalry between}} Rey Escorpión and Último Guerrero {{that led to}} the main event match began back in the summer of 2011. While working under the ring name Escorpión he was teamed up with Último Guerrero for the 2011 Gran Alternativa tournament, a tag team tournament where a rookie (Escorpión) would team up with an {{experienced}} wrestler (Guerrero) for the tournament. The duo defeated the teams of Magnus and Brazo de Plata, Mortiz]and El Terrible, and Diamante and La Sombra to earn a spot in the final match. On April 8, 2011 Escorpión and Guerrero defeated Máscara Dorada and Metal Blanco to win the 2011 Gran Alternativa tournament. Shortly after the Gran Alternativa victory Escorpión changed his name to Rey Escorpión ("Scorpion King") and joined Último Guerrero's Los Guerreros del Infierno group that also included Dragón Rojo, Jr. at the time. In the summer of 2012 Rey Escorpión began having problems with other members of Los Guerreros, especially with the new Guerrero associates Euforia and Niebla Roja. The tension let to Escorpión being kicked out of the group, although the confrontations <b>never</b> <b>turned</b> to an actual fight, leading to Último Guerrero introducing both Euforia and Niebla Roja as full fledge members. On August 31, 2012, during CMLL's weekly Super Viernes show Rey Escorpión teamed with his former Los Guerreros team mates for a Trios tournament, actually winning the tournament despite not getting along with his team mates. Two weeks later the team were unsuccessful in their challenge for the CMLL World Trios Championship, which only furthered the issues between Rey Escorpión and Los Guerreros. The tension finally erupted into a physical encounter as Dragón Rojo, Jr. turned on Los Guerreros, siding with Rey Escorpión as they attacked Euforia after a match on the October 5th Super Viernes show. Afterward Escorpión and Dragón Rojo, Jr. announced that they were forming their own group, targeting Los Guerreros del Infierno. The team of Rey Escorpión, Dragón Rojo, Jr., and Pólvora was unveiled as Los Revolucionarios del Terror ("The Revolutionaries of Terror"). Following the formation of Los Revolucionarios the two factions faced off on several shows, but at the time the storyline never developed further.|$|E
25|$|The Pacers {{started off}} the playoffs against the Atlanta Hawks, whom managed to secure an eighth {{seed in the}} playoffs with a 38-44 record. In Game 1, the Pacers {{suffered}} a devastating loss at home to the Hawks, 101-93. The Pacers bounced back in Game 2, winning 101-85. With the series shifting to Atlanta, the Hawks won Game 3 by 13 points. Indiana then took back the homecourt advantage in the series, winning Game 4 by 3 points in Atlanta. Back in Indianapolis, the Pacers jumped out to an early lead, but the Hawks had a monstrous second quarter, outscoring the Pacers 41-19. With the hometown crowd behind their backs, the Pacers cut the once 30-point lead to 9 late in the fourth quarter, but the rally wasn't enough to win Game 5, losing 107-97. Three days later in Atlanta, the Hawks jumped out to an early 10 point lead, but Indiana led at the half by five. The Pacers got the lead up to nine in the third quarter, but the Hawks came back and had a three-point lead {{at the end of}} the quarter. The game was back and forth throughout the fourth quarter. With three minutes remaining and the Pacers down five, it looked as if their season would come to an end. Then, behind David West, the Pacers ended the game on a 16-4 and won the game by seven to extend the series to a seventh game in Indianapolis. On May 3, 2014, the Pacers hosted a Game 7 at home for the first time in franchise history. A sellout crowd of 18,165 came to watch the Pacers and Hawks play in a win or go home situation. Atlanta led by as many as six in the first quarter, but the Pacers had the lead {{at the end of the}} first by a point. Throughout the second and third quarters, the Pacers went on a 24-6 run to give the Pacers a 17-point lead, and Indiana <b>never</b> <b>turned</b> back, winning the game 92-80. The Pacers then defeated Washington in 6 games in the semifinals, then a rematch with the second-seeded and defending champion Miami in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Pacers surprised many critics, taking Game 1 in the Eastern Conference Finals with a score of 107-95. Unfortunately for the Pacers they ended up losing the next 3 to the Heat before managing to avoid elimination in Game 5 with a close win over the Heat. In the game, LeBron James got into early foul trouble and played less than 30 minutes, while Paul George exploded in the second half to finish the night with 37 points. The game was notable for the infamous incident where Lance Stephenson blew into LeBron James' ear. Despite the win, the Pacers were eliminated in Game 6 by the Miami Heat for the third straight year.|$|E
