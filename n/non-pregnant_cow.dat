40|$|A <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cow</b> is a {{liability}} to a producer. Over {{the last four}} years, cow-calf producers have had an increased number of non-pregnant cows due to factors like environmental conditions and diseases like trichomoniasis. While most {{research has indicated that}} culling a non-pregnant female and replacing the cow with retained heifers, purchased heifers, or purchased cows are the only economic alternatives, recent trends in the cattle market have suggested that keeping a <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cow</b> may also be an alternative. Annual beef cow budgets were created based on typical Nebraska Sandhills conditions. Revenues and costs in these budgets vary according to different classes and age of cattle and replacement strategy. Cash flows are then projected for five years to compare the replacement alternatives. Five-year averages from 2006 - 2010, as well as an additional analysis that used Winter 2010 / 2011 prices, were used to determine the cash flow values. The Total 5 -year Discounted Cash Flow values showed unprofitable levels in the cow-calf industry based on five-year averages whereas the Winter 2010 / 2011 price data resulted in profits. Based on the Total 5 -year Discounted Cash Flow values using five-year averages, the replacement alternative of purchasing cows surfaced as the highest return. Retaining heifers was the highest return replacement alternative when Winter 2011 prices were used. Keeping the <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cow</b> alternative did not prove to be the highest return alternative in either price data used. However, it was not the lowest return either. Different replacement alternatives become attractive at different cull cow values. Lower cull cow values created higher cash flow values when keeping a <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cow,</b> whereas extremely valuable cull cows negated this alternative. Furthermore, Winter 2011 prices suggested that keeping a <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cow</b> was a more feasible alternative than that of purchasing a bred heifer. Advisor: Darrell R. Mar...|$|E
40|$|Fertility {{issues are}} {{a large part of}} {{economic}} losses for the dairy farmers. Early identification of pregnant and non-pregnant cows is a key element to improve reproductive performances and reduce costs for the farmer. The mid-infrared (MIR) spectrum obtained from milk recording routines is an inexpensive and quick method to obtain a fingerprint of the milk composition. This study was conducted {{in the context of the}} European project OptiMIR (INTERREG IVB North West Europe Program). The objective was to investigate the potential use of the entire milk spectrum to identify if a cow is pregnant or not. Investigation was based on 7, 840 spectral records linked to confirmed pregnancy status coming from Luxembourg milk recording. The method was based on comparing a given spectrum to the expected spectrum if the cow would have been non-pregnant. The expected spectra were obtained from solutions of a mixed model (fixed effects: parity, herd, milking moment and days in milk; random effects: animal across lactations) applied to MIR spectra from a subset of <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cow.</b> Therefore the solutions obtained in the model were used on the whole dataset to obtain predicted MIR spectral values for all test-days and prediction errors (residuals) representing the factors not present in the model (reproductive status, unaccounted factors, and error). A predictive quadratic discriminant function was then constructed on the residual spectra to predict the pregnancy status. Leave one out cross-validation showed promising results with an error rate equal to 1. 8 % and 6. 8 % for <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cow</b> and for pregnant cow respectively. Results have shown that MIR milk spectra might be used as a pregnancy diagnosis tool. Therefore, this kind of diagnosis could be made routinely and at a low cost for farmers. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{length of}} the oestrous cycle is reduced in the cow {{following}} daily sub-cutaneous injections of oxytocin during the week after oestrus (Armstrong & Hansel, 1959) but not after hysterectomy (Armstrong & Hansel, 1959; Anderson, Bowerman & Melampy, 1965). Ginther (1967) reported a unilateral luteolytic effect of the uterus in cows given oxytocin, suggesting a local utero-ovarian mechanism. The uterus of the <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cow</b> exhibited considerable muscular activity soon after intravenous injection of oxytocin (Simmons, Dracy & Essler, 1965). Uterine contractions became tetanic and began to subside 17 min later. Armstrong & Hansel (1959) have suggested that uterine afferent impulses may influence indirectly the secretion of hypophysial luteotrophin after the injection of oxytocin. It {{has been shown that}} electrical stimulation through the rectum can induce oestrous activity in anoestrous cows (Hays & Carlevaro, 1959). In the present study, uterine contractions were induced by electrical stimulation to determine if resulting uterine afferent impulses reduce the perio...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this project was to {{investigate}} the differences in monocyte population and function between pregnant and <b>non-pregnant</b> dairy <b>cows.</b> Evaluating the differences in monocyte function may help to understand the immunosuppression of periparturient dairy cows. Blood was collected from three pregnant <b>cows</b> and four <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cows.</b> The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were incubated in six well plates for 3 hours, after which the monocytes were collected. Each cow was sampled twice, with 2 - 5 days in between. There was no difference in the total blood monocyte population {{as a percentage of the}} circulating PMBCs between pregnant and <b>non-pregnant</b> dairy <b>cows,</b> but pregnant cows showed a slightly increase in CD 14 + cells as a percentage of the whole blood monocyte population. Dairy cows in late gestation (270 days) showed a decrease in MHCII expression on the CD 14 + subpopulation compared with <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> and cows in early gestation (120 days). This project showed that monocytes function of non-pregnant, early pregnant and late pregnant dairy cows are different. More research is needed to determine the magnitude of the differences and the consequences for cow health...|$|R
40|$|Kenya’s {{smallholder}} {{dairy sector}} produces 85 % {{of the total}} milk marketed in the country. A major constraint to milk production and number of calves born from the cows is the long calving intervals. Determining <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> early by measuring progesterone levels by day 23 after insemination can help reduce calving intervals, thus improving productivity. A sample of 481 cows was inseminated and 10 ml milk samples collected from each cow on day 0, 13 and 23 after insemination to determine progesterone levels using radioimmunoassay and using I 125 as the tracer. This was to determine timeliness of artificial insemination (AI), cyclicity and pregnancy by day 24 after AI. Rectal palpation was done 90 days after insemination to confirm hormone predictions for non-pregnancy. Conception rates of 53 % were recorded. Mean progesterone levels were 0, 5. 3 and 10. 1 nm/litre at the three stages of sampling respectively for pregnant <b>cows,</b> while <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> recorded 0. 59, 2. 69, 0. 46 nm/litres respectively. Of cows inseminated at the right time, 38 % did not conceive, showing a problem of cyclicity or early embryonic loss. Embryonic loss was recorded in 32 % of <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cows.</b> The post-partum period averaged 5 months. Breeds were similar for conception while cows inseminated during April to June had higher conceptions than those of July to September. Prediction accuracy of <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> was 96 %, thus, open cows can be identified early, reducing {{the time required to}} re-breed and hence reduce calving intervals...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown {{significant}} associations between prepartum energy status and postpartum fertility in dairy cows; therefore, the assessment of energy status by blood metabolites and metabolic hormones and suitable improvement of management during the prepartum period may enhance reproductive performance. Rumen fill score (RFS) is associated with feed intake; however, it is unknown whether RFS is also related to blood parameters. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between RFS and energy status during the prepartum period, and their associations with conception at first artificial insemination (AI) after parturition. In 42 multiparous Holstein cows, RFS assessment and blood sampling were carried out twice a week during 3 weeks of the peripartum period. Ovarian cycles until AI were evaluated by measuring milk progesterone levels. Before calving, positive correlations were observed between RFS and total cholesterol, and RFS did not change in pregnant cows at first AI after parturition, whereas in <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cows,</b> RFS decreased gradually as the calving day approached. After calving, <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> showed lower energy status compared with pregnant <b>cows,</b> and some <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> showed anovulation and cessation of estrous cycle. In conclusion, RFS during the close-up dry period is related to real-time energy status, and is associated with postpartum energy status and conception at first AI in dairy cows...|$|R
40|$|To confirm {{pregnancy}} at {{the early}} stage is quite important in cattle breeding. For this purpose, biological or clinical methods have been adopted. The data obtained through the present chemical process seem to be reliable in confirming cow's pregnancy. (1) Fresh cow's urine was gathered and examined for {{the tone of the}} color and pH. Pale or acidified urine was excluded. (2) The precipitate obtained by adding acetone to cow's urine was separated with a centrifuge. Next, glacial acetic acid was added to the aqueous solution of the precipitate. If the precipitate is found in the solution, it can be decided that the original urine came from a <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cow.</b> (3) The urine which did not give the precipitate in the process mentioned in (2) was treated {{in the same way as}} in (2), adding a different amout of acetone from (2). In this case, too, the solution from the non-pregnant cow's urine gave the precipitate. On the contrary, when glacial acetic acid is used, the solution from a pregnant cow's urine produced no precipitate both in (2) and in (3). (4) The solution wich did not give any precipitate by means of glacial acetic acid in (2) and (3) was tested with 2. 5 % aqueous solution of ninhydrin. In this case, if the solution shows a purplish color, it can be decided that the solution was from a pregnant cow's urine. (5) By this method the writer found　 23 out of 82 subjects to be pregnant. This value is identical to the results given by biological or physiological reserchers. The urine from pregnant cows responded clearly to this test, and it seems to remains positive throughout pregnancy. Four out of the above mentioned 23 pregnant cases were detected as early as from seven to thirty days after artificial insemination. This method, therefore, may be useful in early confirmation of pregnancy. (6) The urine from <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cow</b> showed no response to the test even at the oestrus. 家畜における妊娠の早期診断は,その増産上,非常に重要なことである。これを判定する方法に生理的または臨床的検査法が採用されている。著者のえた資料は化学的な処理にもとづくものであるが,これによっても,牛の妊娠診断が可能であると思われる。 (1) 新鮮尿を採取し,その尿色及びpHを検し,尿色の薄いもの,酸性を呈する尿は本試験の対象から除外する。 (2) 尿にアセトンを加え,生じた沈殿を遠心分離して集める。つぎにその沈殿の水溶液に氷酢酸を添加し,その結果,沈殿を生じたならばその原尿は非妊尿と判定する。 (3) (2) において沈殿を生じなかったものの尿につき,アセトンの量を変えて(2) と同様アセトンを加え,沈殿を集め,その水溶液に氷酢酸を添加し,沈殿を生じたならば,その原尿は非妊尿である。結局,妊娠尿からえられた水溶液は(2) でも(3) でも氷酢酸によって沈殿を生じない。 (4) 以上において氷酢酸によって全く沈殿を生じなかった溶液について, 2. 5 %ニンヒドリン水溶液で呈色試験を行う。このとき紫色を呈するものは妊娠尿である。 (5) 本法の試験結果では 82 例中 23 例の妊娠牛を検出した。この結果は生理的方法,もしくは臨床的方法によって確認したものと全く一致する。しかも 23 例中 4 例は種付後 7 ~ 30 日で妊娠反応陽性を明瞭に示した。なお,妊娠期間中を通して陽性を持続するように推定される。 (6) 非妊尿では発情期においても非妊反応を呈する...|$|E
40|$|The New Zealand (NZ) dairy {{industry}} is reliant on seasonal pasture production and a concentrated calving interval to best match pasture supply and animal demand. To achieve this goal, some farmers induce lactation in late calving cows. This has animal welfare implications, which {{could result in}} non-tariff trade barriers to NZ dairy products (Blackett, Compton and Glassey, C. 2006, Stevens, J., Burton, L, Rendel, J. 2000). Additionally there are concerns with drug residues in the milk from herds where {{a large percentage of}} cows are induced. New standards were introduced in the 2010 - 11 season by the NZ Veterinarians Association (NZVA), Dairy NZ, Dairy Companies Association of NZ (DCANZ) and Federated Farmers. In the 2011 - 12 season the level of inductions within an individual herd will not exceed 8 % reducing to 4 % in 2012 - 13. There will be requirements for information about the stage of pregnancy; the age of the cow (under eight years old) and body condition score (4. 5 to 6. 5). Although this reduction may seem onerous, the NZVA has stated that only 3 % of the national herd was induced in the season just finished, with 98 % of farms being under 15 % (Benny 2011). A survey of Canterbury dairy farmers in 2008 found that 36 % operate a nil induction policy (Pangborn, 2008). With reduced levels of inductions farmers will be forced to adopt an eight week mating system if they are to maintain the traditional calving patterns. If the number of late calving cows cannot be reduced to fewer than 4 %, then a larger number of cows will be culled. If a pregnant cow is worth $ 2, 000 and a <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cow</b> $ 500 there could be significant capital losses. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review the basics of getting cows in calf and strategies for reduced inductions, discuss the results of the nil induction policy of the Lincoln University Dairy Farm (LUDF), and look at the plan of one Canterbury farm to meet the new guidelines...|$|E
40|$|The cervix uteri is a {{rigid tube}} which connects the uterus with the vagina and {{during most of}} the time it is firmly closed. During oestrus, late {{pregnancy}} and parturition, the morphological appearance in the cervix changes markedly, resulting in a softer cervix, which during parturition can even be stretched open to a diameter that is more than a tenfold larger than before. During gyneacological interventions, such as artificial inseminations in several animal species, or in women it would be beneficial to penetrate the cervix with ease. Clinical obsterical problems occur when insufficient closure of the cervix during pregnancy causes premature birth, or when the cervix fails to dilate during birth. Collagen is one of the most important components of the cervix that causes the rigidness of the cervix and during softening of the cervix, collagen has been shown to undergo significant changes in its structure. Several hormones are involved in regulating these changes, by stimulating or depressing processes that are mostly associated with the inflammation cascade. So far studies that aimed to get more insight into the many factors involved in cervical softening have been using cross-sectional study protocols. Ethical and practical considerations in the subjects that are mostly used (women, small laboratory animals or small ruminants) make it almost impossible to perform longitudinal studies in these species. Another limiting factor in these type of studies is the fact that functional changes in the cervix are usually related to the gestational age, rather than the stage of gestation, relative to parturition. The hormonal changes in the maternal blood and the changes that take place in the cervix during parturition are more dramatic compared towhat happens during late pregnancy or the oestous phase of the cycle. It is therefore, logic to assume that during parturition functional changes in the cervix are differently regulated than during the other two stages, that they may differ in several biochemical and cellular aspects, and that timing of these changes relative to the moment of birth is critical. With the studies described in this thesis we aimed to find out if the cow could be a more suitable model for longitudinal studies of the cervix. By using a newly described biopsy technique to study samples that were repeatedly obtained from cows during different stages of gestation we were able to differentiate the biochemical changes that occur in the collagen of the bovine cervix during cervical ripening and during parturition. By adapting an ultrasound cervimetry technique, previously used in women, combining it with frequent blood-sampling and electromyographic (EMG) measurements of the uterus, we were able to continuosly monitor cervical dilatation during parturition and relate this to temporal changes in hormone levels and myometrial activity. In addition, studies of the cervix of the <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cow</b> have shown that regional differences exist in biochemical aspects of collagen and expression of oestrogen and progesterone receptors, indicating that it is critical for the interpration of studies on cellular or biochemical changes, to describe in detail the area were samples were obtained...|$|E

The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the long-term effect of I and Se supplementation on <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cows,</b> pregnant cows and their calves. The hypothalamus pituitary axis was investigated (TSH, T 4, T 3 assays) during a TRH challenge on <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cows.</b> Twenty-four cows, half of them pregnant, were assigned into 2 diet-groups, one group with a low I (0. 45 ppm) and Se (0. 15 ppm) diet (LISe), the other with a high I (5. 45 ppm) and Se (0. 45 ppm) diet (HISe), for a period of 120 days. Nutritional (plasma iodide, urinary I, plasma Se, I content in colostrum and foetal fluids) and functional (thyrotropin, thyroid hormones, glutathione-peroxidase activity in erythrocytes) markers of I and Se status were assayed in dams at regular intervals for 120 days and in their calves at birth. A TRH challenge was performed on 8 <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> at day 110 of the trial. At the end of the study, I and Se nutritional markers were higher in dams in the HISe group, compared to the LISe group, except for plasma Se. At birth, I nutritional markers in calves in the HISe group were higher compared to the LISe group. Reactivity of the pituitary–thyroid-axis was not influenced by I and Se supplementation.

Seasonal differences in pasture composition and nutritional implications. Dairyfarming Annual, Massey University: 46 - 56. This thesis {{presents the results of}} seven experiments or trials between August 1990 and November 1994 designed to study the causes and effects of the variation in nutrient content within dairy pasture in New Zealand and their impact on dairy cow lactation and reproductive performance. The work includes the results of two observational studies; a survey of seasonal variation in dairy pasture nutrients on four dairy farms; two controlled field trials of supplementation of pasture fed cows in seven commercial dairy herds (involving 1650 cows); an experiment recording changes in pasture nutrients with grazing, maturity and soil phosphate levels; and a replicated split plot trial measuring changes in pasture nutrients after nitrogen (N) application. Trials or experiments involved aspects of agronomy and pasture management, herd reproductive performance and dairy cow nutrition. A common theme of the work was examination of factors affecting the high crude protein levels present in the diets of dairy cows consuming fresh ryegrass/white clover pasture, measurement of this and testing of some practices that may affect the productive penalties caused by these high protein levels. Section 1 of the thesis deals with the initial observations (Chapter 1) and a survey of pasture nutrient changes through all seasons on four dairy farms (Chapter 2). The first chapter describes the initial observational studies over two springs (1990 and 1991) in nine commercial dairy herds and additional survey information from 35 herds (1991). There was a strong negative relationship between urea levels in blood (or milk) and milk production in three separate datasets using principal component analysis (PCA). Milk urea levels related closely to pasture protein levels and especially protein/soluble carbohydrate ratios in pasture. Herd reproductive performance was also worse in the herds with higher urea levels. For example, the four herds observed in 1990 averaged 23. 62, 24. 09, 20. 91 and 21. 88 % for pasture crude protein; 7. 38, 8. 20, 5. 85 and 6. 20 mmol/l for serum urea; and 0. 74, 0. 75, 0. 94 and 0. 91 kg milkfat/cow/day respectively over the 17 week period. "Empty" (<b>non-pregnant)</b> <b>cow</b> percentages for the herds were 10. 6 %, 4. 2 %, 1. 8 % and 3. 1 % respectively. Tentative conclusions were {{made on the basis of}} these findings relating especially to the potential negative effects of excess dietary crude protein in pasture on milk production and on herd reproductive performance. These conclusions were then explored in more depth and reported in subsequent chapters. Seasonal changes in pasture nutrients on dairy farms were measured by analysing pasture collected over two years from four dairy farms of varying soil type and climate (Chapter 2). Two of the farms were at Massey University and two in the Waikato district. All farms were of above average productivity for their district. Samples were collected every two weeks from each farm and represented pasture about to be consumed by cows on these farms. These were analysed for major nutrients or analytes (crude protein (CP), acid detergent fibre (ADF), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), soluble carbohydrates (SOLCHO), pectin, digestibility (DOMD), potassium, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium) using near infra red spectrometry (NIRS). Highest pasture CP, DOMD, and SOLCHO levels were found in spring and autumn (ranging from 23. 6 - 25. 8 %, 75. 4 - 78. 1 % and 9 - 12 % DM respectively) with lowest ADF, NDF and pectin levels (ranging from 27 - 28 %, 36 - 38 % and 1. 8 % respectively). The converse applied to the summer period with 20 - 22 % CP, 70 - 71 % DOMD, 8 - 10 % SOLCHO, and 29 - 31 % ADF, 42 - 45 % NDF and 2 - 2. 5 % pectin. Calcium and magnesium levels were highest in summer (0. 8 % and 0. 2 % respectively compared to 0. 65 % and 0. 19 % respectively), and potassium higher in spring and winter (3. 2 %). The potential consequences for milk production from dairy cows calving seasonally are discussed, with particular reference to the imbalance in the rumen between rumen degraded protein and fermentable carbohydrates. Especially notable were the seasonal differences in protein levels and the changes in the type of carbohydrate available in late spring/summer. Soluble carbohydrate decreased, and fibre expressed as NDF and ADF increased in late spring and summer. Section 2 of the thesis deals with supplementation trials on 6 commercial dairy herds (Chapter 3) and another supplementation trial on a 7 th herd involving maize silage and concentrates (Chapter 4). Controlled supplementation trials on six commercial dairy herds (total 1380 cows) were carried out in spring 1992 to examine the reproductive and productive effects of supplementing pasture-fed cows with carbohydrates (either soluble carbohydrate or starch). Herds were split into treated and control groups on each farm to remove individual farm factors from the experiment and relatively low levels of either molasses (3 herds, 700 mls molasses/cow/day) or concentrate (3 herds, 1. 3 kg concentrate/cow/day) were fed for an extended period in spring (approximately 90 days, from 1 September to 25 November). Significant milk production and reproductive effects were measured when results were pooled for all herds. Immediate responses were approximately 0. 5 litres of milk per kg of supplement on average, but the main milk production response was observed later in the experiment (October and November) and was higher in better fed herds and those in better body condition. No effect was found on non-return rate or submission rate, but empty cow rates at the end of the mating season in the supplemented group were half those of the control groups (2. 7 % vs 5 %). These results may indicate considerable productive and reproductive advantage in supporting pasture fed cows through October/November with appropriate supplement when ryegrass is in the reproductive phase, and has reduced digestibility which is likely to limit intake of ME. Improving diet quality or ME concentration at this stage may help reduce the monthly decline from peak lactation which typically occurs at this time in most districts in New Zealand. Chapter 4 describes a controlled supplementation trial which was carried out in spring 1993 on a 240 cow commercial dairy herd where the diet was formulated according to recommended nutrient levels for high production (NRC, 1989). The diet was improved in content of "bypass" protein, soluble carbohydrate, lipid and minerals. The base diet for control and treated groups was pasture and maize silage. Both control and treated herds were offered the same amount of metabolisable energy (ME) - ie. the diets were iso-energetic. Improved milk production (2 litres milk) and reproduction (2. 7 % empty vs 6 %) occurred in response to the addition of the balancing concentrate in the treated group. There was a large carryover effect when the concentrate feeding ceased and the sole diet was pasture. Pasture dry matter assessment indicated the supplemented cows continued to consume more dry matter than control cows. The immediate response to supplementation was 1. 25 litres/kg DM of supplement, and with the carryover response added exceeded 2. 5 litres/kg DM of supplement. The immediate response improved after supplementation had continued for 2 - 3 weeks. This trial did not show substitution for pasture, but the converse. Improving the balance of dietary nutrients in pasture did improve performance. Section 3 of the thesis deals with aspects of grazing management, agronomy and the effects of application of nitrogen to pasture on the nutrients within pasture (Chapters 5 and 6). Variation in pasture nutrients from week to week was evident in the seasonal study presented in Chapter 2. More information regarding changes in pasture nutrients after grazing and as pasture matures was sought because this was considered a likely source of variation in productivity. In Chapter 5 nutrient levels in pasture were determined after grazing or in pasture left ungrazed by sampling every five days during spring from five sites located on two dairy farms. Sites were either grazed as part of normal rotation (3 sites) on the farm or were caged (2 sites) to prevent grazing. Conclusions from this study were limited by a lack of replication, but nevertheless highlighted reduced CP with maturity, increased NDF with maturity and immediately after grazing, reduced SOLCHO just after grazing and reduced digestibility with the advancement of spring into October. Pectin and calcium levels increased as spring advanced. The results were consistent with literature on the subject. The effects of the level of nitrogen fertiliser and the timing of application in spring on pasture nutrient composition were examined in the final experiment reported in Chapter 6. Nitrogen was identified from the literature as one of the main external influences likely to affect pasture protein levels. Nitrogen was applied as urea to small (2 m 2) plots at 0, 20, 40 and 80 kg N/ha and at varying times (15 August, 31 August and 14 September) in late winter/early spring to dairy pasture at the Massey University Dairy Research Unit. The trial was a replicated split plot design with levels of N randomised within starting dates. Significantly reduced ADF and NDF levels, reduced SOLCHO, reduced dry matter %, and increased CP levels occurred after N application. Higher N rates produced greater changes. Application of N earlier in winter resulted in greater effects on ADF (2 % difference vs 6 %), NDF (2 % difference vs 6 %) and CP (5 % vs 7 %) but lesser effects on SOLCHO (1. 5 % difference vs 0. 5 %) and these lasted longer in wintery conditions. Effects on SOLCHO were more marked later in the experiment. Brix values (a refractometer measurement of juice squeezed from the herbage sample) were also examined as part of this study to evaluate their usefulness as a rapid measure of SOLCHO concentration; results were inconclusive. The consequences of the effects of N on pasture for dairy cows are discussed and possible dietary or management improvements to minimise the consequences are suggested. The increased protein and reduced fermentable carbohydrate (reduced SOLCHO and reduced ADF or NDF) mean that poorer rumen fermentation could occur after N application, with lower amounts of bacterial tissue presented to the small intestine from ruminal fluid. A final summarising chapter (Chapter 7) combines the conclusions from the various studies, indicates the need for further information and discusses how this might be obtained. Studies presented in this thesis have not conclusively shown that high CP in pasture has damaging effects on productivity, but have indicated strong associations and various factors influencing pasture CP and also other pasture nutrients...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{oxytocin}} and oestradiol on progesterone production by dispersed luteal cells of <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> were studied. In acute incubation (3 h), oxytocin, at {{a concentration of}} 800 mIU/ml, significantly inhibited the production of progesterone induced by HCG (10 IU/ml). Suppression of basal progesterone production was evident in some corpora lutea. Lower oxytocin concentrations (4 and 40 mIU/ml) had no effect. At a concentration of 400 mIU/ml, oxytocin may be inhibitory to basal and HCG-induced progesterone production. Oestradiol (1 μkg/ml) {{had no effect on}} basal progesterone production but may suppress the production of progesterone induced by HCG. However, incubation with oxytocin (400 mIU/ml) plus oestradiol (1 μg/ml) resulted in a significant inhibition of HCG-induced progesterone production. These data provide evidence for an inhibitory effect of oxytocin on the corpus luteum of <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cows.</b> Oestradiol may interact with oxytocin to inhibit the bovine corpus luteum function...|$|R

Between Days 14 and 18 of pregnancy {{blood flow to the}} uterine horn containing the conceptus increased (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) 2 - to 3 -fold, whereas blood flow to the non-gravid uterine horn in these cows remained constant. No corresponding increase in blood flow to the uterine horn ipsilateral to the ovary bearing the CL was observed in <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> during this 4 -day period. By Day 19 of pregnancy, blood flow to the gravid uterine horn had returned to a level similar to that observed on Day 13.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present field study was to establish the beneficial effects of re-insemination of <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> using ultrasonography 20 to 23 days after the artificial insemination. A total of 245 Japanese Black cows were artificially inseminated and early pregnancy diagnosis (EPD) was performed on 92 cows 20 days after insemination, using ultrasonography. The remaining 153 cows were considered as negative controls in which routine rectal palpation was performed for pregnancy diagnosis 45 - 50 days post-insemination. EPD revealed that eleven of the 92 cows (12 %) were infertile due to ovarian abnormalities and were thus excluded {{from the rest of}} the study. Forty-eight (59 %) of the remaining 81 cows were diagnosed as pregnant, while the other 33 (41 %) were diagnosed as non-pregnant. Of these <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cows,</b> 17 of them received a dose of an analogue of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH analogue) and were then timed-inseminated, while the other 16 were observed for estrus signs, and 13 of them (81 %) were artificially inseminated. Rates of conception were 35 % and 38 % in the GnRH and the artificially inseminated groups, respectively (P> 0. 05). Total pregnancy rate for the EPD group increased significantly (74 %) (P< 0. 01) when compared to the control cows (54 %) within the same period. In conclusion, our field study demonstrated that re-insemination of <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> following EPD is highly efficacious not only in improving the rate of fertility via reducing inter-insemination and inter-calving intervals, but also aids in the early detection of ovarian disorders...|$|R

However, there are still limited studies regarding improvement of production efficiency in this category, mainly in developing countries and in tropical areas. One of the limiting factors is the difficulty to obtain reliable estimates of weight variation in mature cows. This occurs due to the interaction of weight of maternal tissues with specific physiological stages such as pregnancy. Moreover, variation in gastrointestinal contents due to feeding status in ruminant animals is {{a major source of}} error in body weight measurements. Develop approaches to estimate the individual proportion of weight from maternal tissues and from gestation in pregnant cows, adjusting for feeding status and stage of gestation. Dataset of 49 multiparous non-lactating Nellore cows (32 pregnant and 17 non-pregnant) were used. To establish the relationships between the body weight, depending on the feeding status of pregnant and <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cows</b> as a function of days of pregnancy, a set of general equations was tested, based on theoretical suppositions. We proposed the concept of pregnant compound (PREG), which represents the weight that is genuinely related to pregnancy. The PREG includes the gravid uterus minus the non-pregnant uterus plus the accretion in udder related to pregnancy. There was no accretion in udder weight up to 238 days of pregnancy. By subtracting the PREG from live weight of a pregnant cow, we obtained estimates of the weight of only maternal tissues in pregnant cows. Non-linear functions were adjusted to estimate the relationship between fasted, non-fasted and empty body weight, for pregnant and <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cows.</b> Our results allow for estimating the actual live weight of pregnant cows and their body constituents, and subsequent comparison as a function of days of gestation and feeding status...|$|R

In both populations, warble larvae numbers were highest in calves and higher in <b>non-pregnant</b> than pregnant <b>cows.</b> Nose bots showed no relationship with pregnancy or lactation; KS calves had higher nose bot loads than cows, a pattern not observed in AM. Pregnant cows had more rump fat than <b>non-pregnant</b> <b>cows.</b> KS cows lacking rump fat entirely had the highest warble burdens. We observed lactating pregnant cows with moderate larval burdens. Projected energy cost of the heaviest observed combined larvae burdens was equivalent to 2 - 5 days basal metabolic rate (BMR) for a cow, and 7 - 12 days BMR for a calf. Foregone fattening in adult cows with average burdens was 0. 2 to 0. 5 kg, but almost doubled with the heaviest infestations to 0. 4 and 0. 8 kg. Average burdens in calves resulted in forgone fattening of about 0. 5 kg, with peak costs equivalent to 0. 7 and 1. 1 kg fat for AM and KS calves respectively. Although modest, these projected energy costs of hosting larvae for cows support the negative relationship between rump fat and larvae burden. For calves, hosting high burdens of warble larvae could affect winter survival, specifically those weaned normally in October or in early winter. Harmful effects of oestrid larvae burdens may remain subtle but clearly cumulative in relation to seasonal forage availability and incidence of other parasites...|$|R
