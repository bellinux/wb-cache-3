The throttle valve was fully closed. When the parameters were changed, the stepper motor was adjusted automatically to control the engine speed at 800 r/min. When the θi is changed from 40 to 10 o BTDC, the maximum ITE and the maximum power are observed at λ= 1. 1. As λ increases, the maximum ITE is corresponding to a greater θi. The COVimep will be increased if the θi is too advanced or too small. When λ is more than 1. 3, the COVimep increases obviously. When λ= 1. 1, NOx emissions get the highest level.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze various cooking fuel options {{commonly}} used in Indian households, namely, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG CO) derived from crude oil and (LPG <b>NG)</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas,</b> kerosene, coal, electricity, firewood, charcoal, crop residues, dung cake and biogas. In this paper, we used life cycle energy analysis approach to determine the life cycle energy efficiency (LCEE) of cooking fuels. The daily heat energy requirement by the Indian households for cooking activities is about 2150 kcal. Amongst the analyzed fossil fuels, LPG derived from natural gas has the highest energy efficiency of 45 % and coal with 14. 7 % is the least energy efficient fossil fuel option for household cooking. The life cycle energy efficiency of traditional biomass fuels is 11. 9 - 7. 5 %, which is much lower than those of commercial cooking fuels like LPG and kerosene. The life cycle energy efficiency of charcoal is found to be 9 % and is lower than that of firewood. The energy efficiency of biogas is found to be comparable to that of LPG and is potentially a sustainable cooking fuel option in Indian context...|$|E

The proposed Gas Electricity Planning (GEP) model considers the NG value chain, i. e., from the supply to end-consumers through NG pipelines and the electrical systems value chain, i. e., power generation and transmission, in an integrated way. The sources of NG can be represented by <b>NG</b> wells, liquefied <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> (LNG) terminals and storages of NG and LNG. The electricity generation may be composed by hydro plants, wind farms, or thermal plants where the latter represent {{the link between the}} gas and the electricity chain. The proposed model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear optimization problem which minimizes the investment and operation costs to determine the optimal location, technologies, and installation times of any new facilities for power generation, power interconnections, and the complete <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> chain value (supply/transmission/storage) as well as the optimal dispatch of existing and new facilities over a long range planning horizon.

In this study, based on the current (2009) and predicted (2020) situations of China, ICEVs (internal combustion engine vehicles), EVs (electric vehicles) and FCVs (fuel cell vehicles) are assessed through a life cycle analysis in terms of energy consumption, carbon emission, PM 2. 5 and well-to-wheel efficiency. The results show that FCVs using hydrogen from <b>NG</b> (<b>natural</b> <b>gas)</b> reforming (no electrolysis of water) are suitable for the short-term energy conservation and emission reduction in China, because they are less dependent on the Chinese electricity mix dominated by coal-fired energy. EVs and FCVs using water-electrolyzed hydrogen powered by the Chinese electricity grids may cause serious energy and environmental issues, and {{the requirements of the}} electricity mix before the commercialization of these vehicles are estimated. For the vehicle price, ICEV s and EVs (with subsidies) are less expensive than FCVs in 2009, but it remains debated for 2020 with the development of technology and change of policy.

Waiting for the cutting-edge appliances (i. e.

Additionally, due to the higher water content in exhaust gas when H 2 NG is burned, it was investigated on how heat recovery efficiency has been affected by condensing operating conditions. Finally, to estimate this benefit, an expeditious procedure was developed building three maps for H 2 NG blends condensing properties from 0 % up to 30 % vol. of H 2.

A question arises of what is the optimal use of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> as a transportation fuel. Is it more efficient to use <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in a stationary power application to generate electricity to charge electric vehicles, compress <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> for onboard combustion in vehicles, or re-form <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> into a denser transportation fuel? This study investigates the well-to-wheels energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from various <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> to transportation fuel pathways and compares the results to conventional gasoline vehicles and electric vehicles using the US electrical generation mix. Specifically, <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> vehicles running on compressed <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> are compared against electric vehicles charged with electricity produced solely from <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> combustion in stationary power plants.
