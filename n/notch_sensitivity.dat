A pivoting arm is raised to a specific height (constant potential energy) and then released. The arm swings down hitting a notched sample, breaking the specimen.

40|$|SummaryThe role of Notch {{signaling}} in {{the maintenance}} of adult murine prostate epithelial homeostasis remains unclear. We found that Notch ligands are mainly expressed within the basal cell lineage, while active Notch signaling is detected in both the prostate basal and luminal cell lineages. Disrupting the canonical Notch effector Rbp-j impairs the differentiation of prostate basal stem cells and increases their proliferation in vitro and in vivo, but does not affect luminal cell biology. Conversely, ectopic Notch activation in adult prostates results in a decrease in basal cell number and luminal cell hyperproliferation. TGFβ dominates over Notch signaling and overrides Notch ablation-induced proliferation of prostate basal cells.  However, <b>Notch</b> confers <b>sensitivity</b> and positive feedback by upregulating a plethora of TGFβ signaling components including TgfβR 1. These findings reveal crucial roles of the self-enforced positive reciprocal regulatory loop between TGFβ and Notch in maintaining prostate basal stem cell dormancy...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe Notch {{receptor}} is a {{key component}} of a core metazoan signaling pathway activated by Delta/Serrate/Lag- 2 ligands expressed on an adjacent cell. This results in a short-range signal with profound effects on cell-fate determination, cell proliferation, and cell death. Key to understanding receptor function is structural knowledge of the large extracellular portion of Notch which contains multiple repeats of epidermal growth factor (EGF) -like domains. Here we investigate the EGF 4 - 13 region of human Notch 1 (hN 1) using a multidisciplinary approach. Ca 2 +-binding measurements, X-ray crystallography, { 1 H}- 15 N heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser effects, and residual dipolar couplings support a non-linear organization for the EGF 4 - 13 region with a rigid, bent conformation for EGF 4 - 7 and a single flexible linkage between EGF 9 and EGF 10. These data allow us to construct an informed model for EGF 10 - 13 which, in conjunction with comparative binding studies, demonstrates that EGF 10 has an important role in determining <b>Notch</b> receptor <b>sensitivity</b> to Dll- 4...|$|R

From the experiments, {{it is found that}} the <b>notch</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the film increases with the increase {{in the size of the}} hole, but the <b>notch</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and the stress concentration of the notch are insignificant and there is a decrease of only about 4 %- 10 % in tensile strength for the notched specimens with different hole sizes in diameter compared with the unnotched specimen.

All the patients underwent FMD and Doppler of uterine arteries between their 24 th and 28 th gestational weeks. Calculations of sensitivity and specificity for both isolated and associated methods were performed. ResultsNineteen out of the 91 patients developed preeclampsia, while the rest remained normotensive. Doppler flowmetry of uterine arteries with presence of bilateral protodiastolic <b>notch</b> had <b>sensitivity</b> of 63. 1 % and specificity of 87. 5 % for the prediction of preeclampsia.

The performance, in this respect, {{of the most commonly}} used alloys at Volvo Aero Corporation (VAC), 718 and the higher temperature capacity Waspaloy, are therefore the main subjects for this thesis. The emerging Allvac 718 ® PLUSTM (718 Plus) is also included due to the prospect of replacing the expensive Waspaloy. The overall emphasis is on weldability through Varestraint testing but limited work was initially carried out on <b>notch</b> rupture <b>sensitivity</b> of 718 Plus. The notch rupture testing of 718 Plus emphasized the importance of the secondary phases like delta-phase in the grain boundaries. Hot cracks were observed in all alloys with re-solidified products on the liquated and re-solidified grain boundaries. Grain boundary liquation and segregation of alloying elements was considered to be the primary reason for liquation of HAZ grain boundaries which caused cracking. Evidence of constitutional liquation of Nb rich MC type carbides in alloy 718 and 718 Plus were found in the region adjacent to the fusion zone and also on the cracked grain boundaries.

The Wöhler S-N curves were determined by reversed bending for the different experimental conditions. A different improvement of the fatigue strength was found, depending on the peening intensity, and, particularly, a different effectiveness of the treatments for different notch geometries: the more critical notches received the larger beneficial effect by the shot peening treatment in terms of reduction of the <b>notch</b> fatigue <b>sensitivity</b> and increment of the notch fatigue strength. The fatigue improvements {{with respect to the}} unpeened condition and the influence of the peening intensity on fatigue were discussed accounting for the residual stress effects. The extent of the residual stress redistribution during loading was investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements on plain specimens.

METHODS AND MATERIAL: This prospective study in a setup of tertiary-level care center includes 500 high-risk pregnant women from rural and urban sectors and evaluates the predictive values of various Doppler indices. RESULTS: Out of 500 patients, 110 patients had abnormal Doppler among them, 70 patients had abnormal uterine artery Doppler, and 50 patients had abnormal umbilical artery Doppler flow indices. In all, 10 patients had both umbilical artery and uterine artery abnormal Doppler indices. When uterine artery was abnormal (70 patients), 20 patients had preeclampsia, 10 patients had pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), and 25 patients had intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Systolic/diastolic (S/D) ratio and <b>notch</b> had <b>sensitivity</b> of 60 % and positive predictive value of 33. 3 % and 37. 5 %, respectively. When umbilical artery was abnormal (50 patients), 10 had preeclampsia, 15 had PIH, and 15 had IUGR. S/D ratio had the highest positive predictive value of 40 %; sensitivity is same for all. In uterine artery, combination of parameters had the best sensitivity of 80 %, followed by notch and S/D ratio. In umbilical artery, combination of parameters, S/D ratio, and RI (resistance index) had sensitivity of 40 %; specificity of all the indices was 91 – 96 %. In all, 20 patients had bilateral notch, and among them 15 developed preeclampsia and 15 developed IUGR.

SEM fractography was used to reveal the different mechanisms of crack initiation and propagation. The investigated materials were: Distaloy AE, Distaloy DC, Distaloy HP, Fe + 2, 0 % Cu + 0, 8 % C, Astaloy Mo, and Astaloy CrL. All materials were pressed to a green density of 7, 05 - 7, 10 g/cm 3 and sintered 30 min at 1120 deg C. CrL was also sintered at 1250 deg C. The results showed that the heterogeneous materials (Distaloys and FeCuC) showed low <b>notch</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> q= 0, 6 - 0, 8 and that the homogeneous materials (Astaloys) showed notch sensitivities in the range q= 0, 6 - 1. Thus, no general rule that covers all PM steels can be stated. High temperature sintering of Astaloy CrL increased both the fatigue limit and the <b>notch</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> SEM fractography showed that the materials with low <b>notch</b> <b>sensitivity</b> displayed a more trans-particle crack initiation and the materials with high notch sensitivitiy displayed more sinter-neck crack nucleation.

40|$|To {{systematically}} {{compare the}} notches of the lateral femoral condyle (LFC) {{in patients with}} and without complete tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in MR studies by (1) evaluating {{the dimensions of the}} lateral condylopatellar sulcus; (2) evaluating the presence and appearance of an extra or a double notch and its association with such tears. This retrospective study was approved by our institutional review board, and informed written patient consent was waived. in 58 cases of complete ACL tears and 37 control cases with intact ACL, the number of notches on the LFC was determined, and the depth and anteroposterior (AP) length of each notch were measured in each third of the LFC. the chi-square test, t-test, and logistic regression model were used to analyze demographic data and image findings, as appropriate. Presence of more than one <b>notch</b> demonstrated a <b>sensitivity</b> of 17. 2 %, specificity of 100 %, positive predictive value of 100 %, and negative predictive value of 43. 5 % for detecting a complete ACL tear. Lateral third depth measurement (p = 0. 028) was a significant associated finding with a complete ACL tear. A deep notch in the lateral third of the LFC is a significant associated finding with a complete ACL tear when compared with an ACL-intact control group, and the presence of more than one notch is a specific but insensitive sign of such a tear.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{retrospectively}} evaluate {{magnetic resonance}} (MR) imaging for {{the depiction of}} meniscal tears with partially detached meniscal fragments displaced in the intercondylar notch or in the meniscal recesses of the knee. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board required neither its approval nor informed patient consent for the retrospective review of patient data; however, informed patient consent had been obtained before the MR imaging examinations were performed. The presence of meniscal tears with notch and recess fragments was determined at MR imaging and at subsequent arthroscopy in 101 consecutive knees to determine the value of MR imaging for the depiction of these lesions. Initial reports were reviewed to evaluate results of initial interpretations. MR images were retrospectively analyzed to determine the value of several MR image signs {{for the detection of}} displaced tears with notch or recess fragments. RESULTS: At arthroscopy, 37 (41 %) of 91 torn menisci had partially detached fragments. Twenty-six torn menisci had notch fragments, and 14 had recess fragments; three torn menisci had one notch and one recess fragment each. At initial MR image analysis, 38 (36 %) of 105 torn menisci had partially detached fragments. Twenty-eight torn menisci had notch fragments, and 13 had recess fragments; one torn meniscus had two recess fragments, and three torn menisci had one notch and one recess fragment each. At initial analysis, sensitivities and specificities were, respectively, 69 % and 94 % for detection of tears with notch fragments and 71 % and 98 % for detection of tears with recess fragments. At retrospective analysis of sagittal MR images, the presence of at least one sign indicative of meniscal tear with a <b>notch</b> fragment had <b>sensitivities</b> and specificities, respectively, of 65 % and 78 % for observer 1 and 77 % and 73 % for observer 2. The presence of at least one sign indicative of a meniscal tear with a recess fragment had sensitivities and specificities, respectively, of 64 % and 77 % for observer 1 and 64 % and 76 % for observer 2. CONCLUSION: Meniscal tears with notch and recess fragments are frequently seen at arthroscopy and can be depicted at knee MR imaging with moderate sensitivity and high specificity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} high cycle fatigue resistance associated to notches {{and the role of}} short crack propagation in the fatigue <b>notch</b> <b>sensitivity</b> quantified by the notch factor kf. An integrated fracture mechanics approach is proposed to estimate the fatigue <b>notch</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> by including the effect of both blunt and sharp notches. Whether fatigue strength at a given life is controlled by crack initiation (very blunt notches, kf = kt), by microstructuraly short cracks (blunt notches, kf < kt), or by mechanically short crack propagation (sharp notches, kf << kt), depends on the stress concentration kt, the notch length D and the material threshold to crack initiation ΔσeR, to short crack propagation ΔKth and to long crack propagation ΔKthR. The approach includes the prediction of the fatigue crack propagation threshold for short cracks, previously developed to analyze the short crack behavior in metallic materials with or without blunt notches, and is integrated adding the influence of sharp notches and accounting for the controlling parameters. It estimates the fatigue resistance of the component by comparing the threshold for fatigue crack propagation as a function of crack length, ΔKth, with the applied ΔK for the given configuration. Estimations for results reported in published bibliography are presented. The proposed fracture mechanics approach allows accounting for the effects of notch acuity, notch size and intrinsic material fatigue properties on fatigue <b>notch</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> It opens the door to a new simple method for predicting fatigue <b>notch</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and fatigue strength of components with geometric concentrators by using parameters that can be easily measured or estimated, without the necessity of any fitting parameter...|$|E
