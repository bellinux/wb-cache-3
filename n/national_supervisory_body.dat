Current financial and economic crisis accentuates high unemployment, fulminate bankruptcy of many firms and impossibility of quantification of negative economic and social consequences. That's why, fiscal specialists believe that taxation of insurance represents an important issue both for insurers and the European or/and <b>national</b> <b>supervisory</b> <b>body</b> of insurance market, and also for individuals or/and legal entities. EU attempts to harmonize first the national legislations regarding the taxation and then those relating to insurance, aiming to ensure the specific solvency of insurance companies. Estimating that, the significance of fiscal considerations {{in the decision to}} subscribe insurances contracts, different European countries, including Romania, have tried and managed through its fiscal laws to apply different ways for fiscal deductibility of insurance expenses. The taxation of insurance should be regarded and analyzed both from the perspective of gross premiums subscribed and received by insurance companies and services from the insurer. Insurers ‘benefits may take various forms (daily allowances, sums insured in case of life or death, rents, amounts provided for single-premium policy, those with capitalization) depending on the policy and concluded the nature of risk covered. Taxation of these benefits are achieved with the principles and logic of tax (a tax or insurance premiums or benefits), but depends on the binding and/or voluntary policy. Legislation regarding taxation is changing frequently. Besides this, we assist now at several changes, both in legislation regarding the accounting and insurance domain. To avoid failure of these entities, the European Commission, through its agencies, helped to create the legal framework to ensure the solvency of insurance companies. The implementation of IAS/IFRS in our country, for insurance companies, helped supervisors and local decision makers to use XRL in order to disclosure the accounting information's in financial statements understandable for the investor. Between taxation – legislation – accounting – solvency exist a real connection, which positive evolution will help the standard of live. In order to do so I performed an analysis on a sample of 32 countries and a horizon of 6 years (2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011). During our work, we tested 4 linear regression models (life gross written premiums, non-life gross written premiums, number of insurance companies and number of employees in the insurance sector). The results will confirm the existing link between development level of countries and insurance, but exclude the relationship between taxation and insurance. The conclusions of the paper will help the practitioners and The Financial Supervisory Authority in their decisions. We must point out that this study is a continuation of our work started in 2009...|$|E

40|$|On the 6 th January 2011, the European Commission’s DG Internal Market and Services {{issued an}} ambitious {{consultation}} document, Technical Details of a Possible EU Framework for Bank Recovery and Resolution which elaborates further on its bank rescue proposals. This paper critically reviews these proposals. Following {{the receipt of}} responses to this consultation, the EU proposes to release draft bank rescue legislation by June 2011. A harmonised European financial institution rescue regime is proposed to build upon national laws and <b>national</b> <b>supervisory</b> <b>bodies.</b> The proposed resolution framework will require adherence to seven key principles, including the reduction of moral hazard and risk reduction. Other principles include an emphasis upon prevention and preparation; providing credible resolution tools, enabling fast and decisive action by authorities and contributing to a smooth resolution of cross border groups. Investment firms that are not currently subject to prudential regulation will not be covered, {{but there will be}} new group resolution procedures. Due to the influence of prevailing laissez-faire market ideas, little room seems to exist in these proposals for continued state involvement in the banking sector, even though excessive adherence to these narrowly market-oriented ideas was a cause of the recent global financial crisis; some {{other parts of the world}} were able to more effectively weathered the storm of the recent financial crisis with some degree of government involvement in markets...|$|R

The proposal also aims at paying close attention to the economics of public administration and international relations in allocating competences among <b>national</b> and supranational <b>supervisory</b> <b>bodies.</b> Before detailing the own proposition, this paper looks into the relationship between sovereign debt and banking crises that drive regulatory reactions to the financial turmoil in the Euro area. These initiatives inter alia affirm effective prudential supervision as a pivotal element of crisis prevention. In order to arrive at a more informed idea, which determinants apart from a perceived appetite for regulatory arbitrage drive banks 2 ̆ 019 organizational choices, this paper scrutinizes the merits of either a branch or subsidiary structure for the cross-border business of financial institutions. In doing so, it also considers the policy-makers perspective. The analysis shows that no one size fits all organizational structure is available and concludes that banks 2 ̆ 019 choices should generally not be second-guessed, particularly because they are subject to (some) market discipline. The analysis proceeds with describing and evaluating how competences in prudential supervision are currently allocated among <b>national</b> and supranational <b>supervisory</b> authorities. In order to assess the findings the appraisal adopts insights form the economics of public administration and international relations. It argues that the supervisory architecture has to be more aligned with bureaucrats 2 ̆ 019 incentives and that inefficient requirements to cooperate and share information should be reduced. Contrary to a widespread perception, shifting responsibility to a supranational authority cannot solve all the problems identified. Resting on these foundations, the last part of this paper finally sketches an alternative solution that dwells on far-reaching mutual recognition of <b>national</b> <b>supervisory</b> regimes and allocates competences in line with supervisors 2 ̆ 019 incentives and the risk inherent in crossborder banking groups...|$|R
