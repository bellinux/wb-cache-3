50|$|Most of the {{activity}} in Canada is found in research. In 2001, the Canadian government established the National Institute for Nanotechnology in Edmonton. The Institute conducts nano-research {{in a number of}} fields including the life sciences, supramolecular assembly, molecular scale devices and nano-sensors. As of 2010, a number of Canadian universities offer engineering degrees in nanotechnology. Of particular note is the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology which will be in operation in 2011 and will conduct research related to nano-engineered materials, <b>nano-electronics</b> design and fabrication, nano-instrumentation and nano-biosystems.|$|E
50|$|Power {{dissipation}} within traditional {{metal oxide}} semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) generates a bottleneck when dealing with <b>nano-electronics.</b> Tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs) may become an alternative to traditional MOSFETs because {{they can have a}} smaller subthreshold slope and supply voltage, which reduce power dissipation. Computational studies showed that silicene based TFETs outperform traditional silicon based MOSFETs. Silicene TFETs have an on-state current over 1mA/μm, a sub-threshold slope of 77 mV/decade and a supply voltage of 1.7 V. With this much increased on-state current and reduced supply voltage, power dissipation within these devices is far below that of traditional MOSFETs and its peer TFETs.|$|E

Her most widely cited work includes at least four areas of fundamental research (see Selected Publications below); structure-transport relationships in graphene, surface morphology and step fluctuations, electronic interactions with surface defects, and adsorbate-interactions.|$|E
5000|$|The early {{versions}} of bio-electrosprays {{were employed in}} several areas of research, most notably self-assembly of carbon nanotubes. Although the self-assembly mechanism is not clear yet, [...] "elucidating electrosprays as a competing nanofabrication route for forming self-assemblies {{with a wide range}} of nanomaterials in the nanoscale for top-down based bottom-up assembly of structures." [...] Future research may reveal important interactions between migrating cells and self-assembled nanostructures. Such nano-assemblies formed by means of this top-down approach could be explored as a bottom-up methodology for encouraging cell migration to those architectures for forming cell patterns to <b>nano-electronics,</b> which are a few examples, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Carbon nanotubes, {{also called}} buckytubes, are {{cylindrical}} carbon molecules with novel properties {{that make them}} potentially useful {{in a wide variety}} of applications (e.g., <b>nano-electronics,</b> optics, materials applications, etc.). They exhibit extraordinary strength, unique electrical properties, and are efficient conductors of heat. Inorganic nanotubes have also been synthesized.A nanotube is a member of the fullerene structural family, which also includes buckyballs. Whereas buckyballs are spherical in shape, a nanotube is cylindrical, with at least one end typically capped with a hemisphere of the buckyball structure. Their name is derived from their size, since the diameter of a nanotube is on the order of a few nanometers (approximately 50,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair), while they can be up to several centimeters in length. There are two main types of nanotubes: single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs).|$|E
5000|$|Neural {{networks}} are {{the wave of}} the future. They start with no knowledge, and learn from experience. Often {{there is no reason for}} them to stop learning, which means they can accumulate a vast amount of experience. Radar and antenna systems are much more capable and powerful in this way, and sometimes better at making decisions than a human. There is a large amount of research on neural networks in communications theory today. [...] It is only one type of artificial intelligence. Other techniques have been applied to large arrays of MIMO systems. These include estimation theory and Markov chains. [...] Quantum particle swarm optimization is another approach. [...] Another is the stochastic pooling network. It is said to be [...] "applicable to examples in biological neural coding, <b>nano-electronics,</b> distributed sensor networks, digital beamforming arrays, image processing, and multiaccess communication".|$|E

It will study a wide range of nanoscale phenomena, including the synthesis of nanocrystals, nanowires and supramolecular-based nanomaterials, the fabrication of molecular-scale devices, the development of nano-scaled materials for chemical reactions at semiconductor surfaces, protein design, genetic engineering and nanoelectromechanical systems. Of particular recent note is the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology, which will be in operation in 2011 conducting research related to nano-engineered materials, <b>nano-electronics</b> design and fabrication, nano-instrumentation and nano-biosystems.

40|$|While {{most of the}} {{electronics}} industry {{is dependent on the}} ever-decreasing size of lithographic transistors, this scaling cannot continue indefinitely. <b>Nano-electronics</b> (circuits built with components on the scale of 10 nm) seem to be the most promising successor to lithographic based ICs. Molecular scale devices including diodes, bistable switches, carbon nanotubes, and nanowires have been fabricated and characterized in chemistry labs. Techniques for self-assembling these devices into different architectures have also been demonstrated and used to build small scale prototypes. While these devices and assembly techniques will lead to nanoscale electronics, they also have the drawback of being prone to defects and transient faults. Fault tolerance techniques will be crucial to the use of <b>nano-electronics.</b> Finally, changes to the software tools that support the fabrication and use of ICs will be needed to extend them to support nanoelectronics. This survey introduces <b>nano-electronics</b> and reviews the current progress made in research in the areas of technologies, architectures, fault tolerance, and software tools. 1...|$|E
