5|$|The lack of prokaryotic <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{limited the}} growth of ocean eukaryotes, which require {{oxidized}} nitrogen suitable {{for the production of}} organic nitrogen compounds or the organics themselves (like proteins) from prokaryotic bacteria.|$|E
5|$|The work of Pasteur and Koch did not {{accurately}} reflect the true {{diversity of the}} microbial world because of their exclusive focus on microorganisms having direct medical relevance. It {{was not until the}} work of Martinus Beijerinck and Sergei Winogradsky late in the 19th century that the true breadth of microbiology was revealed. Beijerinck made two major contributions to microbiology: the discovery of viruses and the development of enrichment culture techniques. While his work on the Tobacco Mosaic Virus established the basic principles of virology, it was his development of enrichment culturing that had the most immediate impact on microbiology by allowing for the cultivation {{of a wide range of}} microbes with wildly different physiologies. Winogradsky was the first to develop the concept of chemolithotrophy and to thereby reveal the essential role played by microorganisms in geochemical processes. He was responsible for the first isolation and description of both nitrifying and <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>bacteria.</b> French-Canadian microbiologist Felix d'Herelle co-discovered bacteriophages and was one of the earliest applied microbiologists.|$|E
25|$|Other organisms require {{additional}} metals as enzyme cofactors, such as vanadium in the nitrogenase of the <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{of the genus}} Azotobacter, tungsten in the aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase of the thermophilic archaean Pyrococcus furiosus, and even cadmium in the carbonic anhydrase from the marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii.|$|E

50|$|Some Dryas {{plants have}} root nodules that host the <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>bacterium</b> Frankia.|$|R
50|$|Pseudomonas azotifigens is a Gram-negative, <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>bacterium</b> {{isolated}} from a compost pile in Japan.|$|R
25|$|Coppicing of the {{riverside}} alder trees is still carried out, often unintentionally by the anglers. Alders grow well in wet soils and are specially adapted {{for the low}} nutrient conditions through having large root nodules containing <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>bacteria</b> that enrich the soil {{in the same way}} as clover plants and other legumes.|$|E
25|$|Certain plants, namely Fabaceae, form root nodules {{in order}} to {{associate}} and form a symbiotic relationship with <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>bacteria</b> called rhizobia. Due to the high energy required to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, the bacteria take carbon compounds from the plant to fuel the process. In return, the plant takes nitrogen compounds produced from ammonia by the bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The final {{carnivore}} with a pitfall-like trap is the bromeliad Brocchinia reducta. Like most {{relatives of}} the pineapple, the tightly packed, waxy leaf bases of the strap-like leaves of this species form an urn. In most bromeliads, water collects readily in this urn and may provide habitats for frogs, insects and, more useful for the plant, diazotrophic (<b>nitrogen-fixing)</b> <b>bacteria.</b> In Brocchinia, the urn is a specialised insect trap, with a loose, waxy lining and a population of digestive bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Azospirillum canadense is a <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>bacterium</b> {{isolated}} from corn rhizospheres. Its type strain is DS2T (=NCCB 100108T =LMG 23617T).|$|R

25|$|Kudzu {{has been}} used as a form of erosion control as well as to enhance the soil. As a legume, it {{increases}} the nitrogen in the soil by a symbiotic relationship with <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Its deep taproots also transfer valuable minerals from the subsoil to the topsoil, thereby improving the topsoil. In the deforested section of the central Amazon Basin in Brazil, it {{has been used}} for improving the soil pore-space in clay latosols, thus freeing even more water for plants than in the soil prior to deforestation.|$|E
500|$|The lack of {{dissolved}} molybdenum {{limited the}} growth of prokaryotic <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>bacteria,</b> which require molybdenum-bearing enzymes for the process ...|$|E
500|$|However, once oxygen {{had been}} created in {{seawater}} by the limited eukaryotes, it reacted with water and the molybdenum in minerals on the sea bottom to produce soluble molybdate, making it available to <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>bacteria.</b> [...] Those bacteria provided fixed usable nitrogen compounds for higher forms of life.|$|E

500|$|The first chapter, [...] "Birth", {{begins with}} {{lightning}} starting a forest fire. The heat dries the Douglas-fir cones enough for their scales to spread and release winged seeds. Rain water transports one seed to a sunlit area with well-drained soil. Rodents and insectivores, whose food stashes were {{destroyed in the}} fire, eat truffles, which survived underground, and leave feces containing <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>bacteria</b> in the soil. Following one dormant winter stage, the seed begins to germinate.|$|E
2500|$|An endosymbiont or endobiont is any {{organism}} {{that lives}} to mutual benefit {{within the body}} or cells of another organism, i.e. in an endosymbiosis (Greek: ἔνδον endon [...] "within", σύν syn [...] "together" [...] and βίωσις biosis [...] "living"). [...] Examples are <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>bacteria</b> (called rhizobia), which live in root nodules on legume roots, single-cell algae inside reef-building corals, and bacterial endosymbionts that provide essential nutrients to about 10–15% of insects.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{beneficial}} symbionts are acquired horizontally, {{from the}} environment or unrelated individuals. This requires that host and symbiont have some method of recognizing each other or each other’s products or services. Often, horizontally acquired symbionts are relevant to secondary rather than primary metabolism, for example for use in defense against pathogens, but some primary nutritional symbionts are also horizontally (environmentally) acquired. Additional examples of horizontally transmitted beneficial symbionts include [...] bioluminescent bacteria associated with bobtail squid and <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>bacteria</b> in plants.|$|E
50|$|Bradyrhizobium kavangense is a <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>bacterium</b> {{from the}} genus of Bradyrhizobium {{which has been}} {{isolated}} from the nodules of the cowpea Vigna unguiculata in the Kavango region in Namibia.|$|R
50|$|Cupriavidus taiwanensis is a Gram-negative, <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>bacterium</b> of {{the genus}} Cupriavidus and family Burkholderiaceae, which forms {{indeterminate}} nodules on Mimosa pudica. The genome of C. taiwanensis is completely sequenced.|$|R
50|$|Bradyrhizobium liaoningense is {{a species}} of legume-root nodulating, microsymbiotic <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>bacterium.</b> It was first {{isolated}} from Glycine soja and Glycine max root nodules in China. Its type strain is strain 2281.|$|R
2500|$|Kudzu {{is a very}} stress-{{tolerant}} plant. Kudzu is {{drought tolerant}} and only the above ground portions of the plant are damaged by frost. [...] Kudzu also forms symbiotic relationships with <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>bacteria</b> to convert atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonium {{which can be used}} by surrounding plants. [...] Now the dominant nitrogen-fixing plant in the eastern United States, kudzu fixes an estimated 235kg of nitrogen per hectare per year, which is an order of magnitude higher than the rates of native species. [...] This ability allows it to flourish in nitrogen-poor sites where other plants are unable to grow. [...] In the absence of other plants, nitrogen then builds up in the soil, allowing the maintenance of large leaf areas and high photosynthetic rates.|$|E
2500|$|Atmospheric {{nitrogen}} must be processed, or [...] "fixed", in a usable form to {{be taken}} up by plants. Between 5x1012 and 10x1012 g per year are fixed by lightning strikes, but most fixation is done by free-living or symbiotic bacteria known as diazotrophs. These bacteria have the nitrogenase enzyme that combines gaseous nitrogen with hydrogen to produce ammonia, which is converted by the bacteria into other organic compounds. Most biological nitrogen fixation occurs by the activity of Mo-nitrogenase, found {{in a wide variety}} of bacteria and some Archaea. Mo-nitrogenase is a complex two-component enzyme that has multiple metal-containing prosthetic groups. An example of the free-living bacteria is Azotobacter. [...] Symbiotic <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>bacteria</b> such as Rhizobium usually live in the root nodules of legumes (such as peas, alfalfa, and locust trees). Here they form a mutualistic relationship with the plant, producing ammonia in exchange for carbohydrates. Because of this relationship, legumes will often increase the nitrogen content of nitrogen-poor soils. A few non-legumes can also form such symbioses. Today, about 30% of the total fixed nitrogen is produced industrially using the Haber-Bosch process, which uses high temperatures and pressures to convert nitrogen gas and a hydrogen source (natural gas or petroleum) into ammonia.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the term}} [...] "weed" [...] {{generally}} {{has a negative}} connotation, many plants known as weeds can have beneficial properties. A number of weeds, such as the dandelion (Taraxacum) and lamb's quarter, are edible, and their leaves or roots {{may be used for}} food or herbal medicine. Burdock is common over much of the world, and is sometimes used to make soup and medicine in East Asia. Some weeds attract beneficial insects, which in turn can protect crops from harmful pests. Weeds can also prevent pest insects from finding a crop, because their presence disrupts the incidence of positive cues which pests use to locate their food. Weeds may also act as a [...] "living mulch", providing ground cover that reduces moisture loss and prevents erosion. Weeds may also improve soil fertility; dandelions, for example, bring up nutrients like calcium and nitrogen from deep in the soil with their tap root, and clover hosts <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>bacteria</b> in its roots, fertilizing the soil directly. The dandelion is also one of several species which break up hardpan in overly cultivated fields, helping crops grow deeper root systems. Some garden flowers originated as weeds in cultivated fields and have been selectively bred for their garden-worthy flowers or foliage. An example of a crop weed that is grown in gardens is the corncockle, (Agrostemma githago), which was a common weed in European wheat fields, but is now sometimes grown as a garden plant.|$|E
