40|$|The {{estimation}} of the discount rate is decisive for a reliable economic valuation. The discount rate has to be adjusted for the risks related to the company, the sector which the company has its market, and the risks related to the investment project. We present a proposal to incorporate the risk premium to the discount rate. The novelty of the methodology is that difference risk groups according to activity as a factor to adjust the cost of capital to companies. The study applies the methodology to the Agro-Industrial Complex (AIC) in Spain. The AIC is formed by industries that add value to farming production. This sector’s economic success demands financial management techniques that assess risk. The conventional method responds neither to the heterogeneity <b>of</b> the economic <b>activities</b> {{that make up the}} AIC, nor to differentiating risk by groups. The proposed methodology distinguishes activity groups in accordance with the <b>NACE</b> (National <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> Economic <b>Activities)</b> and uses net profitability variability to distinguish the risk in each group. Our results demonstrate the various levels of risk per group. The results show that among all the groups that form the AIC there are wide differences between levels of risk; thus, the risk neutral groups present risk levels on the order of 150 times lower than the groups extreme risk levels...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{show how}} {{internationalization}} and foreign-owned firms influence synergies {{in the regional}} innovation systems of Hungary. We first distinguish three innovation system functions (knowledge exploitation, knowledge exploration, and organizational control) operating in regions and study their interactions using entropy statistics. The functions and their interactions are measured by analysing the distribution of firms in terms of geographical location, organizational size (number <b>of</b> employees), technologies (<b>NACE</b> <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> the OECD), and ownership (foreign versus domestic share in registered stock) in the 2005. Synergy is defined as mutual information among the three dimensions; a fourth dimension is added {{in order to bring}} internationalization (FDI) into the model. The factor is relevant since the four-dimensional model explains the GDP contributions to regional development in Hungary, whereas the three-dimensional model does not. We find that regional innovation systems in Hungary are self-organized differently, in relation to {{a relatively small number of}} foreign firms. These firms have a large positive effect on synergy in regions between the Hungarian capital and the Austrian border.

However, <b>NACE</b> <b>codes</b> are often inappropriate tools to distinguish between logistics facilities operated by logistics providers depending on their activities, for two reasons. First, some <b>NACE</b> <b>codes</b> are too broad compared to the segmentation of the logistics market.

Second, <b>NACE</b> <b>codes</b> are self-referenced by the companies, and two facilities operated by the same kind of company (and sometimes the same company) for the same activity can be described by two different <b>NACE</b> <b>codes.</b> Even if some <b>NACE</b> <b>codes</b> describe a specific activity (as 59.29 A, see Table 1), some facilities that are used for this activity may not be described by these codes but by generic ones (as 49.41 B, 49.41 A or 52.29 B, see Table 1).|$|R

The hypothesis of the study is to reveal how tourism functionality of a territory is a dominant or a complementary one. On the other hand it also shows the role of the tourism phenomena in shaping the basic functionality of some local economies. The methodology consists in a series of statistical analysis of data, for a period of 13 years (2000 - 2012), containing at administrative unit level and <b>NACE</b> <b>code,</b> evolution <b>of</b> the number of companies, particularly those operating in Tourism, the number of employees, turnover and profit. The results are represented by a series of statistical and cartographic detailed analysis, showing some correlation variations. For example: how the variation of the total profit is influenced by the variation of the turnover, of the number of companies and of number of employees. This are able to widely conclude the present contribution of the tourism sector in the local economy, to show if the economic functionality of a territorial systems belong to the tourism sector or there is also other economic activities that contribute to the complexity of the economic profile...|$|R

Previous studies have compared prediction methods to daily PA record scores over 7  days [83] and PAEE estimated from the adapted PA compendium over 24  h [75]. Again the PASIPD was poorly correlated with the reference standard, whereas outputs from a tri-axial Actiwatch demonstrated a stronger correlation, r[*]=[*] 0.51 [83]. Nightingale and colleagues [75] supported their earlier laboratory findings, demonstrating that the Actiheart™ with individual HR calibration explained more {{of the variance in}} free-living PAEE than using the Actiheart™ with proprietary algorithms.

However, not only striatothalamocortical motor circuits but also other interconnected pathways could be implicated in its pathogenesis. METHODS: In a series of experiments, we applied repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the lateral cerebellum {{in a group of}} patients with advanced Parkinson disease, to investigate whether modulation of cerebellothalamocortical circuits by means of rTMS may result in a modification of a dyskinetic state induced by levodopa ingestion. RESULTS: We found that a single session of cerebellar continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) was capable of transiently reducing LID. In the same patients, we observed that cerebellar cTBS changed the profile of activation of intracortical circuits in the contralateral primary motor cortex. Cerebellar cTBS reduced short intracortical inhibition and increased long intracortical inhibition, inducing a cortical reorganization that is associated with a reduction of LID. Furthermore, in another experiment, we observed that a 2 -week course of bilateral cerebellar cTBS induced persistent clinical beneficial effects, reducing peak-dose LID for up to 4 weeks {{after the end of the}} daily stimulation period. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that cerebellar continuous theta burst stimulation has an antidyskinetic effect in Parkinson disease patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesia, possibly due to modulation of cerebellothalamocortical pathways...|$|R
