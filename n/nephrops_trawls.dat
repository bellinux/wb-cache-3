40|$|Abundance and biomass of cod, haddock, and whiting in thewaters off of {{the west}} coast of Scotland (wcoS) have {{undergone}} large changes in recent years, most notably a recent decline. These three species contribute a considerable part of Scottish demersal landings from this area and as such {{it is important to understand}} why these stocks are behaving theway they are. A number of explanations for the decline have been proposed, including: seal predation, pressure from <b>Nephrops</b> <b>trawls,</b> and fishing pressure more generally. We used an ecosystem model of the wcoS continental shelf (, 200 m depth) to investigate whether these proposed explanations for declining gadoid stocks are feasible. Results suggest that the rise in the grey seal population over recent years has not led to the decline in gadoid stocks; there is insufficient bycatch by the Nephrops fleet to have a large impact on gadoid stocks; however, fishing, as a key driver of thewest of Scotland shelf ecosystem, has impacted stocks and by decreasing fishing levels to maximum sustainable yield cod biomass may increase slightly though not returning to previous levels. Although this means we are little further forward in understanding the cause of recent gadoid declines in the area, the development of this model has enabled us to further our knowledge and understanding of aspects of trophic structure and the impacts of fishing on the wcoS.

The Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) {{is the most important}} shellfish resource in UK waters and although the fishing effort has increased considerably over past decades the ecosystem effects of this fishery have yet to be evaluated. This study provides the first assessment of the catch and discard composition from <b>Nephrops</b> <b>trawls</b> in the Clyde Sea area with particular emphasis on invertebrate discards. Nephrops constituted only between 14 and 23 % of the total catch (volume); other invertebrates and fish accounted {{for the remainder of the}} catch. On an average, 9 kg of discards were produced per kilogram of Nephrops. The catch composition differed markedly between samples from the north and south Clyde Sea areas. Trawls from the south yielded a significantly higher biomass of Nephrops (30 % cf. 4 % in the north) and fish discards (55 % cf. 36 % in the north) whereas catches from the north contained more invertebrates (60 % cf. 15 % in the south). Crustaceans and echinoderms accounted for up to 83 and 73 % of the discards, respectively. Samples from the north also contained a greater variety of invertebrate species (93 taxa cf. 51 taxa in the south). The differences between the two study areas are likely to be a reflection of differing bathymetries, hydrographic conditions and ground types in each area...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePoor {{selective}} gears like bottom trawlers {{are known}} to induce joint productions ie catch of several categories of fish by targeting one category in particular. Joint productions can be inter-species or intra-species. They can be retained to be sold or discarded {{most of the time}} with high mortality rates when caught by trawlers. Joint productions make management more complicated as they make classical solutions known to reduce or negate the effects of negative externalities difficult to apply. In this paper, the bio-economic impact of changing gear to reduce joint productions and so limit the external effects is studied {{in the case of the}} <b>Nephrops</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery in the bay of Biscay. The example of the Nephrops pot fishery of Loch Torridon (Scotland) compared to the <b>Nephrops</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery in the bay of Biscay enables to discuss the exploitation conditions leading to the success of an alternative gear.

40|$|Eco-labelling {{schemes that}} focus on {{sustainable}} fisheries {{have the potential to}} influence behavioural changes in fishing practices, which hopefully lead to the long term goal of productive, environmentally sound and sustainable fisheries. This thesis presents a case study of a <b>Nephrops</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery. Despite being a bottom trawl fishery, it has been certified as sustainable and well managed by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), a leading wild capture fisheries certification programme for sustainable seafood. In addition this thesis presents an overview of seafood eco-labelling schemes and discusses how bycatch data obtained through a partnership between science and industry can inform fisheries management. The research on the fished ecosystem comprised an analysis of random sub-samples received from the fleet of certified trawlers. This involved evaluating a self-assessment scheme that was initially implemented to provide additional bycatch data across the whole fleet. Analysis showed that the scheme could produce robust results, conditional on {{the quantity and quality of}} the sub-samples collected by the fishermen being maintained at specified levels. Biological processing of the sub-samples also allowed the establishment of an extensive database, quantitatively detailing the amount of bycatch typically produced by a <b>Nephrops</b> <b>trawl</b> vessel in the region. Overall, the bycatch represented 37 % of the whole catch by weight, with low catch rates of two sensitive species, Atlantic cod and Spurdog being recorded. The results from analyses of these sub-samples compare well with those from previous studies on this fishery in which the entire catch had been analysed. Similarity of the catch compositions found in the sub-samples also suggests a high degree of uniformity in the fishing process across this fleet. Two small studies on spurdog survivability and on fishing gear interactions with the sea pen Funiculina quadrangularis provided biological information relevant to satisfying the conditions of certification. This case study highlights how the MSC approach can be an effective tool for fisheries management and has the potential to generate more benefits than current non-participatory legislation...|$|R
40|$|Age {{at length}} keys (ALKs), which give the {{probability}} of age given length, are a fundamental component of many age-based fish stock assessment methods. Usually, ALKs are compiled from readings of otoliths or scales taken from length-stratified sub-samples of fishery landings or research vessel trawls catches. The assessment process is data intensive when there are numerous fleets assessment sub-regions to be sampled over an annual cycle, making the collection and analysis of material costly and time consuming. Hence, the data are almost always sparse, often with voids that require in-filling before use in assessments. Though robust statistical procedures for automatically in-filling data voids have been developed, {{they have not been}} widely adopted, and procedures often remain manual. Here we use Generalized Linear Models to derive {{the probability of}} age given length from sparse data gathered during the International Bottom Trawl Survey and Scottish commercial sampling program. The keys are used to test statistically for differences between ALKs from different sampling regions, differing gear geometries, different sampling programs and fish at different life stages. The results of the comparisons suggest that ALKs from the commercial sampling program are not, in general, comparable to those generated by the IBTS program. We also found that ALKs from <b>Nephrops</b> <b>trawls</b> are significantly different from those generated by other trawls over the same sampling region. The tests also suggest that age at length distributions differ not only between but also within IBTS roundfish areas, in part due to differences between ALKs for mature and immature fish. These differences are an important factor when considering a reduction in the resolution of sampling areas and when combining data from countries with differing fleet compositions. They also raise important questions about present protocol for collection of otolith data from IBTS survey trawls...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe <b>Nephrops</b> <b>trawl</b> {{fishery is}} one of the most {{important}} fisheries in the Bay of Biscay. The fishery management essentially relies on conservation measures, a total allowed catch (TAC) for Nephrops together with a minimum landing size (MLS) and minimum trawl mesh size (70 mm stretched mesh). These measures have failed to prevent high discard levels of many species that characterize the fishery. Nephrops trawlers thus discard about half of their Nephrops catches in numbers (a third in weight) of which only 30 % survive. Nephrops discards mainly occur in younger Nephrops age groups below the MLS. This is a waste for the already overexploited Nephrops stock as well as for the fleet. Based on a bio-economic simulation model, the paper analyses the consequences of several scenarios of improving Nephrops selectivity. The potential impacts of these scenarios on Nephrops biomass, landings, discards and economic indicators (e. g. rent) are examined and a cost‚Äìbenefit analysis of each scenario is carried out. We show that a better exploitation pattern would benefit fisheries that have high level of discards. Reducing non-commercial Nephrops discards leads to positive net present values of rent with better value realized from the production potential and limited short-term losses for the fishing units. By taking account of the economic dynamics of increasing effort however, we show that selectivity measures are insufficient. Regulating access to the fishery is also required to ensure the sustainability of the fishery and a better exploitation of the production potential...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDemersal fish {{landings}} {{from the}} Firth of Clyde peaked in 1973, then declined rapidly until the targeted demersal fishery ceased in 2005. The abundance of large fish decreased during this period, and their numbers have not recovered since 2005. We aim {{to determine whether}} changing growth rates {{have contributed to the}} decline in the abundance of large fish. Bottom trawl survey data from 1980 to 2012 was used to calculate the annual mean length-at-age and time series of von Bertalanffy growth parameters of five demersal species; cod, haddock, whiting, Norway pout and saithe. Two regions were considered: the Firth of Clyde and the neighbouring seas west of Scotland (the western shelf). There have been substantial decreases in the lengths of most age groups of Clyde haddock and whiting due to declines in both asymptotic length and von Bertalanffy growth rate. Lengths-at-age have also declined in western shelf populations, but at markedly slower rates than within the Clyde. Trends in temperature and year class strength tended to contribute little to changes in the growth parameters, so declines in length-at-age have been largely due to other factors. Fishing intensity is greater in the Clyde than western shelf, and the size selectivity of the fisheries differ as more Clyde vessels use <b>Nephrops</b> <b>trawling</b> gear. Since trends in growth were also more extreme in the Clyde, it appears as though size-selective fishing may have caused reductions in the lengths of these fish. If the changes in growth are partially due to fishing induced evolution then it may take many generations for the changes to reverse...|$|R
40|$|The Study Group on Nephrops Surveys (SGNEPS) met in Ancona, Italy from 6 ‚Äì 8 March 2012. The group {{consisted}} of 12 scientists from Ireland, Scotland, England, Northern Ireland, Spain, Denmark, Portugal and Italy under the chairmanship of Colm Lordan, Ireland. SGNEPS has an important role as the international coordina-tion group for Nephrops UWTV surveys in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean. Heretofore SGNEPS has focused on planning, protocols, quality control, design and survey development issues. At the 2012 meeting group compiled a table summarizing the station densities and precision levels of most annual Nephrops UWTV surveys. Large variations in survey station densities occur across the grounds currently sur-veyed. Station density, accuracy and precision trade-offs were investigated and dis-cussed in detail for the two main survey design types (random stratifies and grids). The main outcome of these deliberation was that a minimum precision level of < 20 % CV (also known as Relative Standard Error) should be attained for these types of surveys. There may be operational reasons why individual surveys should aim for higher precision than that (e. g. to ensure good coverage and accurate burrow surfac-es). In some areas station densities could be reduce to allow for improved coverage to previously unsurveyed Nephrops grounds. Progress towards integrated stock assess-ments for Nephrops which make use of all sources of fisheries dependent and inde-pendent information was reported to the group. There was consensus that the current ICES framework for assessing and providing catch options based on the UWTV sur-veys remains the most appropriate methodology for the moment. There has been significant progress since WKNEPH (ICES, 2007) in addressing many of the per-ceived uncertainties in the methodology. The remaining assumptions on burrow occupancy, burrow size, growth, discard survival can only be addressed through dedicated research projects of which there have been few. Several video enhancement and technological developments were presented to the group and these look very promising in terms of improving certainty of burrow identification and facilitating validation counts. The group also discussed the various <b>Nephrops</b> <b>trawl</b> surveys and biological sampling requirements under the DCF {{and concluded that the}} role of the group should be expanded to cover these in future.

40|$|The density, size {{composition}} {{and growth of}} Nephrops norvegicus were examined at six sites in part of the Firth of Clyde, SW Scotland, between 1990 and 1992. Sampling was carried out using small mesh trawls and by an underwater television camera. The growth of male Nephrops at each site was investigated by analysis of length‚Äìfrequency distributions using the computer program ‚Äò‚ÄòMultifan‚Äô‚Äô. Estimates of Nephrops density at each station were obtained from TV counts of burrows and from relative trawl catch rates. Both density measures were correlated and showed a similar pattern between stations, although burrow counts exceeded trawl catches by roughly two orders of magnitude. Marked geographical variations were recorded in both the growth (L ÔøΩ and K) and density parameters, and L ÔøΩ {{was found to be}} inversely correlated with burrow density, suggesting that growth may be density-dependent. The weighted annual mean carapace length of <b>Nephrops</b> in <b>trawl</b> samples was significantly correlated with L ÔøΩ, suggesting that mean size data may provide a useful indicator of growth variability within and between populations. On the other hand, the maximum carapace length (L max) ofNephrops in samples was found to provide an unreliable estimate of L ÔøΩ. The results are discussed in relation to possible environmental influences on growth and population density...|$|R
40|$|Baltic Sea Benthic {{ecosystem}} impacts from demersal {{fishery in}} the western Baltic is assumed to come mainly from <b>Nephrops</b> <b>trawling</b> in the central and southern Kattegat, mussel dredging in the Belt Sea, and mixed cod trawling {{in the western}} Baltic Sea. These fisheries both impact the seabed, as well as produce substantial amounts of discards. The western Baltic Sea offer {{a unique opportunity to}} analyse the benthic effects of fishingthanks to the closure of √òresund to towed gears since the 1920 s, and the introduction of the Kattegat MPA in 2009 (including cod closure) and the western Baltic Sea Natura- 2000 areas. Furthermore an extensive benthic nationalmonitoring and data collection effort has taken place in the area over a number of years, which can be usedto investigate spatial and temporal differences in the development of benthic communities in (chronically) towed and non-towed areas. To evaluate benthic impacts of towed gears in the Baltic Sea a number of gear technological innovations to reduce effort, benthic contact of fishing gears, and discarding are evaluated. There are conducted experimental fisheries in relation to evaluation and comparison of direct ecosystem and habitat impacts, catch efficiency (target/by-catch/discard/invertebrates), selectivity (discard), energy efficiency, and economic efficiency (vessel specific cost-efficiency/cost-benefit analyses) of different gear modifications compared to standard gears. Furthermore, the case study evaluates potential fishing closures directed towards sensitive benthic habitats and communities. A review of known regional benthic impacts of fishery with demersal towed gears in the area is evaluated with focus on the mussel dredging, demersal cod <b>trawl</b> fishery and <b>Nephrops</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery, where latter is also compared to Nephrops creel fishery. Subtidal dredging and benthic trawling in the area has been reported to affect the benthic fauna and flora as well as to change the structure of the sea bed. The impact of towed gears may also reduce substrate complexity owing to by-catch and movement of shells and stones. Among other this has been demonstrated to locally reduce survival of juvenile blue mussels as well as the population structure of sessile epibenthic organisms. Benthic towing also potentially impact on water transparency either directly owing to resuspension of sediment or {{as a result of a}} reduction in the filtering biomasser. Resuspension is induced at the bottom and in the water column during towing and at the surface when by-catch of sediment is released when heaving/washing the catch. Besides reducing transparency, resuspension of sediment has been found to increase levels of ammonia and silicate in the water column and to reduce the oxygen content. The innovations evaluated comprise: A) Lighter mussel dredges with less benthic impact; B) Smart mussel and cod fishery with previous acoustic or video monitoring or test fishery on the resources before fishery to optimize the catch and to reduce total effort as well as effort on more sensitive habitats resulting in reduced benthic impact; C) Semi-pelagic doors and alternative gear riggings to lift the doors off the seafloor in the western Baltic trawl mixed cod trawl fishery. For species like cod and plaice, which are herded by the sweeps/bridles, an off-bottom door rigging where these other gear components are on the bottom, may be a solution to maintain catchability and eliminate the seabed impact of the doors. The technical challenge with such rigging is to keep the trawl door distance above bottom nearly constant. D) Another focus is scenario evaluation of different effort (re-) allocation schemes with respect to benthic impacts and catch efficiency of W. Baltic mixed trawl fishery by reduction of overall effort or effort in more sensitive habitats through potential closures. The evaluation use the DISPLACE spatial explicit bio-ecomic model (Bastardie et al. 2013; 2014). E) Use short sweep lengths to reduce benthic impacts in the <b>Nephrops</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery (standard of 74 m compared to 5 - 10 m sweeps). Shorter sweeps are not expected to change the selectivity and catch of Nephrops, because Nephrops are not herded by the sweeps, while fish by-catch and discard is expected to be reduced because of less herding. Benthic impacts of demersal trawl fishing in an open fishing area, a short-term closed area, and a long term closed area in the Kattegat and the Sound is investigated. F) Evaluate benthic impacts of creels to be compared to benthic impacts of the Nephrops-fish mixed trawl fishery through overlapping fishery, creel fishery on soft bottom, and test attachment points of creels and inside creel shelters. The comparative analysis of all the above points of changed fishing methods with less benthic impact will involve comparative analyses of catchefficiency, benthic impacts, cost benefit (CBA), energy efficiency, and by-catch and discard. Pilot investigations on use of a light mussel dredge indicate that: a) the weight of sediment retained and re-reduction in energy transfer to the sediment, c) catch efficiency tend to increase ‚Äì reducing effort and area of impact and reducing fuel consumption - and accordingly increasing economic efficiency, and d) Sea floor tracks made by the two dredges could be distinguished by use of a side-scan sonar and the tracks were still detectable two months after fishing. Pilot investigations in relation to use of semi-pelagic trawl doors indicate similar catch rates between door settings, however, there are area and seasonal differences in the catch efficiency when using pelagic doors, possibly due to substrate or seasonal related behavior differences of cod in reaction to the gears. Pilot investigations with evaluation of mixed trawl fishery impact on W. Baltic and Kattegat sensitive habitats with respect to effort pressure is presented here and will be made finally reported under WP 2 when the actual impact of the specific gear is known. Pilot investigations of bio-diversity and presence/absence of species from benthic sampling in open and short term closed trawl fishing areas in Kattegat is ongoing. Pilot investigations with creels in (Frandsen et al. 2013 b) indicate that i) the creels sank very much down into the soft sediment (camera monitoring); ii) the creels were not directly lifted off the bottom but were dragged for several minutes making a footage (camera monitoring); iii) the bait attracted Hagfish (Myxine spp.) which scared the Nephrops in the creels => some escapement; iv) all by-catch thrown overboard immediately went to the bottom, and no predation from sea birds was observed, and there were observed no visible deviations in the cod's behaviour when they swam to the bottom; v) the catch rates were about 180 g/creel per day; vi) CBA indicate a daily profit about 3800 DKK per day which is comparable to trawl fishery for trawlers 18 m (12 - 17 m) and < 18 m (18 - 32 m) which are common for Black Sea trawl fishery fleet. In each sampling period, the catches were recorded on board from at least two commercial vessels representing the study area. Fieldwork included estimating the total catch and the relative fractions per haul and recording the faunal composition as standardized for per haul duration or per day. The sediment samplings were taken from totally 40 stations and particle size analysis were realized. The stations for sediment sampling were assigned as on a vertical line to land at certain distances from each other and at four different depths. The data derived from PSA (Particle Size Analysis) and also the information of coordinates applied to the ArcMap Sediment Classification Tool (ArcGIS ver 9. 2) to derive the habitat map of the substrate in SSA. The abundance of macro benthic fauna is greater in summer months than in winter, spring and fall. The fishing mortality is increasing in this period. 70. 3 % of total catch is composed of Rapa whelk and 29. 7 % is the bycatch species. The reasons for the heavy pressure on red mullet and whiting populations were the low selectivity of meshes and the long operation durations. The high exploitation rate generally causes the catch of relatively small and immature individuals. Though the rate of discarded catch in weight is lower than the marketed catch, as it is considered in number of individual the discarded portion is larger than the market. The age composition of red mullet was composed of 0 and 1 age groups and of whiting are 0, 1 and 2 age groups. In the whiting fishery of the 2013 and 2014, the mean values of fishing effort are found to have no significant difference between seasons for the landing. The highest CPUE for the landing and discard is estimated in fall and the lowest in spring but the difference is not statistically significant. In red mullet fishery for the same years, the trend seems similar within the whiting fishery. The mean values of fishing effort in red mullet are also not significantly different between seasons for the landing. The highest CPUE for the landing and discard is determined in winter and the lowest in spring with no statistical difference. Though the rate of discard by weight seems less than of landings, the rate of discard by individual number is significantly high and cause great bio-economic losses. SSA can be accepted as a soft bottom habitat that is mostly composed of muddy sand and sandy mud. Stations having hard substratum is very limited. This soft bottom is highly available for all kind of drag-net fisheries and this makes this habitat highly sensitive because of heavy fishing pressure...|$|R
50|$|In July 2011, a {{paper was}} {{published}} indicating a major ecological impact of fishing on the ecosystems of the Clyde. Fishing {{is thought to}} have completely altered the mix and size distribution of fish species in the Clyde. Once dominated by large predatory species (e.g. spurdog, hake and cod), now 70% of species found are small whiting and other small fish. Such a simplification of the ecosystem can possibly lead to a decline in diversity, thus threatening fish stocks and fishery of the future. A report by Marine Scotland suggests that these changes might have been, amongst others, caused by high by-catch rates found in <b>Nephrops</b> fisheries using <b>trawling</b> and dredging equipment. The habitat destruction caused by these methods is also thought to be a major factor influencing species composition and size. Other scientists have concluded that the marine ecosystems in the Clyde are nearing the endpoint of overfishing but, as the Clyde used to be a highly productive system, there is potential for recovery if appropriate measures are taken.|$|R
40|$|A {{fleet of}} 326 bottom {{trawlers}} operate in Greek Seas and their landings represent approximately 30 % {{of the total}} fish production in Greece. In this study, otter trawl landings data were analyzed {{in order to identify}} potential m√©tiers. Landings data between 2002 and 2006 were used, collected from 42 ports in the Aegean and East Ionian Sea. A three-step procedure was applied to identify potential m√©tiers: the first step involved a factorial analysis of the log-transformed landings profiles, the second step a classification of the factorial coordinates, and the third step a further aggregation of clusters based on expert knowledge. In all, six potential m√©tiers were identified in the Aegean Sea, and five in the Ionian Sea. The most important target species were European hake (Merluccius merluccius), deepwater pink shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris), red mullet (Mullus barbatus), caramote prawn (Melicertus kerathurus), picarel (Spicara smaris), cephalopods, bogue (Boops boops), anglers (Lophiusspp.), and Norway lobster (<b>Nephrops</b> norvegicus).

40|$|Trawling {{has been}} {{controversial}} since its introduction in the 17 th century. In 1882 the Fishery Board for Scotland was established and assigned powers to ban beam and otter trawling where {{necessary to protect}} traditional static gear fisheries. Under these powers, {{large parts of the}} inshore waters off the east and west coasts of Scotland were closed to trawling. The Firth of Clyde remained closed until 1962. More recently, in April 2015 solicitors acting for Greenpeace obtained High Court permission for a judicial review of Defra‚Äôs alleged failure to adjust its policy on allocating annual landing quotas to reflect reforms to the CFP. It is claimed the reforms stipulate that greater preference should be given to sustainable low impact fishing methods at the expense of high-impact methods such as trawling. In Scotland, the exclusion of trawling activity from a network of marine protected areas established in July 2015 has also been highly controversial. There is no doubt that some trawl gears can be extremely destructive of fragile habitats and slowly regenerating fauna such as coral. Over expanses of mud or sand, however, it has been claimed that trawling may be a positive factor, akin to ploughing the fields in terrestrial agriculture, and enhancing the productivity of the ecosystem. There have been many scientific studies, both in the field and using mathematical modelling, of the impact of trawling on the seabed. Similarly, we know very well that harvesting of fish and shellfish, whether using trawling or static gear, has consequences for marine food webs. However, there have been few, if any, scientific studies which have put these two aspects of trawling together and then compared the seabed impacts of trawling with the consequences of harvesting. In this project we used a mathematical model to compare and contrast the whole ecosystem effects of harvesting fish and shellfish with the consequences of other aspects of trawling activity, especially the ploughing of seabed habitats. The model is not detailed to the level of individual species or exact locations. Rather it gives results at the level of a whole regional sea area, such as the North Sea or the whole of the west of Scotland. The project had three main components. First, was the extension of an existing mathematical model of a marine ecosystem to include explicit representation of the ploughing effects that different gears have on seabed habitats. Second, an analysis of a large international data set on activity, landings and catches by different fishing gears in northwest European waters, and the mapping of these onto different seabed habitats to generate inputs to the model. Finally, we carried out a series of sensitivity experiments with the model. These experiments investigated the whole ecosystem effects of seabed ploughing by different gears, using food web indicators relevant to the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, and compared them with the impact of one scenario for implementing a landing obligation, and the potential impacts of a reduction in overall fishing activity. For the North Sea, the results show that even if all ploughing effects were eliminated, the effects on the whole ecosystem would be equivalent to only a 1 % or less change in overall harvesting rate of fish and shellfish. This is a very small effect compared to the changes in effective harvesting rate implied by the improvements in gear selectivity required to achieve the landing obligation. For the west of Scotland region, the model showed that the food web was more sensitive to the effects of ploughing by fishing gears than in the North Sea, but the effect was still small compared to the consequences of activity reduction overall. The greater sensitivity of the west of Scotland to seabed ploughing arose because the disturbance rate of muddy sediments was around 5 -times higher than in the North Sea, almost entirely due to the activities of TR 2 <b>Nephrops</b> <b>trawling.</b> Despite our conclusion that the regional scale food web effects of seabed ploughing are small compared to the primary consequences of harvesting fish, {{this is not to say}} that there are no effects on regional biodiversity, or significant effects at local scales on specific habitats or vulnerable species. In particular the study identifies the TR 2 gear fleet as being responsible for the majority of ecosystem-wide consequences of seabed ploughing. This gear has a particularly high ploughing rate and its activity is focussed on muddy sediments where the nutrient chemistry processes are more vulnerable to ploughing than in sandy and coarser sediments...|$|R
