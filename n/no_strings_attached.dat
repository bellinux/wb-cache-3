30|$|To {{challenge}} the mainstream Western neo-liberalism as development model for under-developed countries, China believes her own development model of social capitalism, or capitalism with Chinese characteristics {{that relies on}} investment, trade and technology instead of western aid, can be duplicated abroad (Brautigam 2009 : 312). Consequently, under Beijing Consensus, China is willing to provide financial assistance to under-developed countries with <b>no</b> <b>string</b> <b>attached.</b> Beijing Consensus and Washington Consensus went head-to-head in Angola during 2004. Frustrated by the stiff demands from the IMF to introduce liberal reforms before providing much needed financial aid, the Angola government turned to China in a $ 2 billion oil-backed loan. Aguinaldo Jaime, the defacto Angola deputy prime minister summed up the sentiment of the country towards Western aid, “If you say to a country, ‘We’ll reward you when things are perfectly O.K,’ the country will say, ‘When things are perfectly O.K., we won’t need you anymore.’” j. Yet, the Beijing Consensus {{is not without its}} critics, most noticeably from the US which claims China is basically practising neo-colonialism and the Chinese benevolence comes with a price of ridding off the recipient country’s natural resources. Also, the no-question-asked developmental aid allows corrupted regimes to continue depriving their citizens from reaping the benefits of development. Whereas neo-liberalism under Washington Consensus reinforces the dependency between peripheral states and cores states, the aid-for-asset model under Beijing Consensus creates another form of dependency, regime survival for the weak states.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a detailed syntactic description of English prepositional passives (also known as “pseudopassives”) and discusses their formal treatment in HPSG. The empirical overview includes {{a discussion of}} the familiar (but unformalizable) notion of semantic cohesiveness, as well as new observations about the possibility of elements intervening between V and P. Two formal approaches to the syntactic aspects of the problem are then outlined and compared—one relying on lexical rules, the other taking advantage of HPSG’s capacity to express constraints on constructions. Keywords Pseudopassives,prepositions,adjuncts, HPSG,lexicalrules,constructions 13. 1 Empirical observations English has an exceptionally rich variety of preposition stranding phenomena, perhaps the most striking of which is the prepositional passive—the possibility of passivizing the object of a preposition instead of the direct object of a verb.

Here the NP David, initially the complement of on, is realized as the subject of the passive verb relied, leaving the preposition behind. 1 It is often suggested that the underlined verb and preposition in this construction form a kind of “compound”, an intuitive notion that is open to many 1 I will occasionally use the symbol “t ” to mark the “deep ” position of the passive subject, in cases where there might be ambiguity.

[...] when she was in her twenties. This show was initially called Chicks and Dicks, and two of the characters were already similar to the final characters of Jess and Schmidt. The initial idea was a Will & Grace-style comedy inspired by Meriwether's close friendship with a guy after their exes started dating each other. The FOX network liked the script and pursued Zooey Deschanel for the role of Jess, to whose story Meriwether felt most connected.
