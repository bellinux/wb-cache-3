5|$|In Challenge mode, {{the player}} must sneak around and deliver food to hungry NPCs. Hunger is {{indicated}} above thought bubbles which float above {{the heads of}} the NPCs. An NPC with a burger icon over their head is able to be given food, but they will lose their appetite if they spot the player. NPCs move around the map in a set pattern and have a narrow cone of vision to detect player. Erik Brudvig of IGN described this narrow cone of vision as being similar to those of Metal Gear Solid. NPCs can also detect the player by excessive noise, the amount of sound a player is making is indicated by a <b>noise</b> <b>meter.</b> Challenges can be failed if a player alerts NPCs to their presence. Successful delivery of an item requires sneaking up behind an NPC or surprising them from a hiding place. Points are awarded based on how hungry a character is, the player's stealth and proximity to the NPC and style points on delivery. When presenting food, a Flourish meter appears which quickly fills and empties, requiring a timed button press. The higher the flourish meter, the more style points. Each level has 20 associated challenges and fulfilling half the challenges on a level opens the way to the next level. Once all 80 challenges are completed, an alternative costume is unlocked.

40|$|Background: In dental {{practical}} classes, {{the acoustic}} environment {{is characterized by}} high noise levels {{in relation to other}} teaching areas. The aims of this study were to measure noise levels produced during the different dental learning clinics, by equipments used in dental learning areas under different working conditions and by used and brand new handpieces under different working conditions. Materials and Methods: The noise levels were measured by using a <b>noise</b> level <b>meter</b> with a microphone, which was placed at a distance of 15 cm from a main noise source in pre-clinical and clinical areas. In laboratories, the microphone was placed at a distance of 15 cm and another reading was taken 2 m away. Noise levels of dental learning clinics were measured by placing <b>noise</b> level <b>meter</b> at clinic center. The data were collected, tabulated and statistically analyzed using t-tests. Significance level was set at 5 %. Results: In dental clinics, the highest noise was produced by micro motor handpiece while cutting on acrylic (92. 2 dB) and lowest noise (51. 7 dB) was created by ultrasonic scaler without suction pump. The highest noise in laboratories was caused by sandblaster (96 dB at a distance of 15 cm) and lowest noise by stone trimmer when only turned on (61. 8 dB at a distance of 2 m). There was significant differences in noise levels of the equipment′s used in dental laboratories and dental learning clinics (P = 0. 007). The highest noise level recorded in clinics was at pedodontic clinic (67. 37 dB). Conclusions: Noise levels detected in this study were considered to be close to the limit of risk of hearing loss 85 dB...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{proliferation}} of wireless and mobile products has dramatically {{increased the number}} and variety of low power, high performance electronic systems being designed. Noise is an important limiting factor in these systems. The noise generated is often cyclostationary. This type of noise cannot be predicted using SPICE, nor is it well handled by traditional test equipment such as spectrum analyzers or <b>noise</b> figure <b>meters,</b> but it {{is available from the}} new RF simulators. The origins and characteristics of cyclostationary noise are described in a way that allows designers to understand the impact of cyclostationarity on their circuits. In particular, cyclostationary noise in time-varying systems (mixers), sampling systems (switched filters and sample/holds), thresholding sys-tems (logic circuitry), and autonomous systems (oscillators) is discussed.

40|$|Measurement {{of phase}} noise {{affecting}} oscillators or clocks {{is a fundamental}} practice whenever the need of a reliable time base is of primary concern. In spite {{of the number of}} methods or techniques either available in the literature or implemented as personalities in general-purpose equipment, very accurate measurement results can be gained only through expensive, dedicated instruments. To offer a cost-effective alternative, the authors have already realized a DSP-based phase <b>noise</b> <b>meter,</b> capable of assuring good performance and real-time operation. The meter, however, suffers from a reduced frequency range (about 250 kHz), and needs an external time base for input signal digitization. To overcome these drawbacks, the authors propose the use of bandpass sampling strategies to enlarge the frequency range, and of an internal time base to make standalone operation much more feasible. After some remarks on the previous version of the meter, key features of the adopted time base and proposed sampling strategies are described in detail. Results of experimental tests, carried out on sinusoidal signals provided both by function and arbitrary waveform generators, are presented and discussed; evidence of the meter’s reliability and efficacy is finally given...|$|E
