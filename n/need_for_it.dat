5|$|In early November 2008, the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, at an {{informal}} lunch with foreign diplomats, criticized Iceland's traditional friends (particularly Britain, Sweden and Denmark) {{as well as}} the International Monetary Fund. According to a memo from the Norwegian embassy, he suggested that the Russians might want to use the Keflavík Air Base, the Russian ambassador replied that they had no <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> The President is quoted to have said that Iceland would soon recover, even if they had to fight alone. The President does not necessarily agree with the government on these issues.|$|E
5|$|In {{the control}} and living spaces, the ship had quieted down, too. Orders were given in low voices; the men speak to each other, {{carrying}} out their normal duties, in a repressed atmosphere. A regular pall has descended upon us. I know that all hands {{are aware of the}} decision and recognize the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Perhaps they are relieved {{that they did not have}} to make it. But it is apparent that this unexpected illness, something that could neither have been foreseen nor prevented, may ruin our submergence record.|$|E
5|$|The Conservative {{government}} {{believed there}} was a <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to act to prevent Sinn Féin from using the media to defend {{the actions of the}} IRA, and the measures were part of a wider government response to the increase in violence, which also included changes to the right to silence and the tightening of rules allowing paramilitary prisoners early release. Further controversy also erupted in September 1988 over an intended edition of the Channel 4 discussion programme After Dark which was to have featured the Sinn Féin president, Gerry Adams, as a guest. The show was dropped after the conservative academic Paul Wilkinson – a Professor at Aberdeen University who specialised in the study of terrorism and political violence – voiced strong objections to its transmission (more details here).|$|E

25|$|Distasteful {{though we}} find the whole idea, we think that some {{deliberate}} limitation {{of the volume of}} motor traffic is quite unavoidable. The <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> just can't be escaped. Even when everything that it is possibly to do by way of building new roads and expanding public transport has been done, there would still be, in the absence of deliberate limitation, more cars trying to move into, or within our cities than could possibly be accommodated.|$|E

25|$|BlackBerry 10, a {{substantially}} {{updated version of}} BlackBerry Tablet OS intended {{for the next generation}} BlackBerry smartphones, was originally planned for release in early 2012. The company delayed the product several times, remembering the criticism faced by the BlackBerry Playbook launch and citing the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to be perfect in order to stand a chance in the market. The most recent model with this OS was the Classic which was introduced in December 2014 and was discontinued in early July 2016.|$|E
25|$|By mid-1938 {{information}} about the Norden had worked its way up the Royal Air Force chain of command and was well known within that organization. The British had been developing a similar bombsight known as the Automatic Bomb Sight, but combat experience in 1939 demonstrated the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to be stabilized. Work was underway as the Stabilized Automatic Bomb Sight (SABS), {{but it would not}} be available until 1940 at the earliest, and likely later. Even then, it did not feature the autopilot linkage of the Norden, and would thus find it difficult to match the Norden's performance in anything but smooth air. Acquiring the Norden became a major goal.|$|E
25|$|The {{regiment}} was not fundamentally {{affected by}} the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, which gave it a depot at Glencorse Barracks from 1873, or by the Childers reforms of 1881 – as it already possessed two battalions, there was no <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to amalgamate with another regiment. However, as it had become the county regiment of the Edinburgh area, it was retitled The Royal Scots (Lothian Regiment), and it took on a militia battalion and seven battalions of Volunteers from the local area. The regimental district was reorganised in 1887, with Berwickshire being transferred to the recruiting area of the King's Own Scottish Borderers along with the country; the remaining volunteers were reorganised in 1888, {{for a total of}} eight volunteer battalions.|$|E

25|$|There {{will be no}} {{retractable}} roofonly {{roof over}} the standsas the cost for that alone would be 300 million SEK, more than the original projected cost of the whole stadium itself, {{but there is a}} possibility to build such in the future if there is <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Nya Gamla Ullevi will also have natural grass on the pitch since the stadium will host matches of the 2009 European U-21 Championship, where all matches must be played on grass. As with a retractable roof, there is a possibility to change to artificial turf in the future. There are also some concerns that the natural grass may not grow very well since the closed corners and high stand prevent wind and sun to reach the pitch.|$|E
25|$|Karjalan Liitto is an {{interest}} group of Karelian evacuees which hopes that Karelia {{will once again}} become part of Finland at some point, but does not openly demand it. Some smaller groups, such as ProKarelia, continue to campaign for the peaceful return of Karelia. However, no serious political party has openly supported this goal, and Finnish politicians generally {{say there is no}} <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> citing Finland's peace treaty with Russia. There are some individual politicians who support the return of Karelia, such as MEP Ari Vatanen, and two candidates in the presidential election of 2006: Timo Soini and Arto Lahti. Other candidates have stated that Finland has signed a peace treaty and should not campaign for the return of what are now Russian-developed territories. During a debate prior to the 2012 presidential election Timo Soini reiterated his view that, if elected, he would advance the issue.|$|E
25|$|In March 2010, the WTO {{ruled that}} European governments unfairly financed Airbus. In September 2010, a {{preliminary}} report of the WTO found unfair Boeing payments broke WTO rules and should be withdrawn. In two separate findings issued in May 2011, the WTO found, firstly, that the US defence budget and NASA research grants {{could not be used}} as vehicles to subsidise the civilian aerospace industry and that Boeing must repay $5.3 billion of illegal subsidies. Secondly, the WTO Appellate Body partly overturned an earlier ruling that European Government launch aid constituted unfair subsidy, agreeing with the point of principle that the support was not aimed at boosting exports and some forms of public-private partnership could continue. Part of the $18bn in low interest loans received would have to be repaid eventually; however, there was no immediate <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to be repaid and the exact value to be repaid would be set at a future date. Both parties claimed victory in what was the world's largest trade dispute.|$|E

500|$|Michael Stewart, Wilson's Foreign Secretary, {{recommended}} that Britain take preliminary steps towards removing Beadle from the Privy Council if the Chief Justice did not resign or dissociate {{himself from the}} republic [...] "within a week or two" [...] after the new constitution came into force. Given the gravity of such an action—only one Privy Counsellor, Edgar Speyer, was struck off the list during the 20th century—and the likelihood that accusations of vindictiveness would result, the British government was loath to do this, and hoped that Beadle would remove the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> by resigning.|$|E

The ambulance had a Meteor body and Cadillac chassis, and provided for two bed patients and two stretcher cases. Ossining later purchased the ambulance to start their own ambulance corps. In May 1946, a dinner was held to honor the returning veterans of World War II. In the same year, the village purchased all loaned fire equipment, and purchased a new Mack pumper truck (the first Engine 92) in May 1947 to replace the 1929 chemical truck.|$|E

500|$|This {{journey was}} {{conceived}} by Wilson. He had suggested the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> in the Zoology {{section of the}} Discovery Expedition's Scientific Reports, and was anxious to follow up this earlier research. The journey's scientific purpose was to secure emperor penguin eggs from the rookery near Cape Crozier at an early embryo stage, so that [...] "particular points {{in the development of}} the bird could be worked out". This required a trip in the depths of winter to obtain eggs in an appropriately early stage of incubation. A secondary purpose was to experiment with food rations and equipment in advance of the coming summer's polar journey. Scott approved, and a party consisting of Wilson, Bowers and Cherry-Garrard set out on [...] 1911.|$|E
500|$|The film {{introduces}} {{a vehicle that}} has been compared with the Batplane and the Batcopter, dubbed [...] "the Bat". In designing the Bat, Nathan Crowley approached {{it as if it}} were an actual military project, emphasising the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to [...] "fit into the same family" [...] as the Tumbler and the Batpod. The final version of the Bat takes its design cues from the Harrier Jump Jet, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey and the Boeing AH-64 Apache. Chris Corbould described the Bat's size and shape as presenting a major challenge for filming given Christopher Nolan's emphasis on practical effects over computer-generated imagery. In order to make the Bat [...] "fly", it was variously supported by wires, suspended from cranes and helicopters, and mounted on a purpose-built vehicle with hydraulic controls to simulate movement.|$|E
500|$|The [...] are a rabbit-like {{race that}} can live {{three times as}} long as a Hume, and divided into two subraces: The light-skinned Veena and dark-skinned Rava. The Viera have rabbit or deer-like features, most notably their long ears. Their feet are shaped {{in such a way that}} in order to stand they must wear high heels. Their slender forms heighten their senses and speed, and {{although}} their defense is low, Viera agility and finesse are unmatched by the other races. In Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, Vieras have blue-white, pale green, or purple-white hair, with only a few having hair that is pure white, which is considered to be a blessing. Viera can listen to the surrounding nature and sense Mist, and can sometimes go berserk from feeling an overwhelmingly vast quantity of active Mist. In Final Fantasy XII, they live in hidden villages deep within the vast forests of Ivalice. The Viera believe themselves to be intimately tied to the [...] "Wood", a part of the forests themselves, and are rarely involved in matters outside the wood. A Viera that moves out of the forest, like Fran, is considered an outcast and dead to her people. Mixed breeds of Veena and Rava Viera have accustomed themselves to coexist within Hume society, dyeing their white hair.
