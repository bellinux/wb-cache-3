25|$|During his {{freshman}} year, Boehner {{was a member}} of the Gang of Seven which was involved in bringing media attention to the House banking scandal. The group also investigated the Congressional Post Office, leading to the indictment of Congressman Dan Rostenkowski.

25|$|Subsequent statewide polling {{then saw}} a surge among several candidates, {{including}} <b>Newt</b> <b>Gingrich</b> <b>and</b> Ron Paul, who would both {{surge in the}} final weeks before the caucuses. On December 3, 2011, in Atlanta, Georgia, Herman Cain officially announced the suspension of his campaign, due to the various allegations of sexual harassment, a 13-year affair, and personal attacks on his family. Soon thereafter {{it was reported that}} Cain would endorse Gingrich the following Monday, but it proved to be untrue, with Cain refusing to endorse any other candidates. Despite the suspension of his campaign, the Republican Party of Iowa will still report caucus vote totals for Cain.|$|E

25|$|Trained in the 1970s in Neuro-Linguistic Programming by Richard Bandler (Hartmann is {{licensed}} by Bandler's Society of NLP as both an NLP Practitioner and an NLP Trainer, and Bandler wrote the foreword to his book Healing ADD), Hartmann popularized {{some of its}} concepts in Cracking the Code (2007), which argues that <b>Newt</b> <b>Gingrich</b> <b>and</b> Frank Luntz made use {{of them in the}} 1980s and 1990s for Republican Party causes and advocates using them to advance liberalism. His book Healing ADD also leans heavily on NLP techniques. Co-authored with Lamar Waldron, Hartmann's Ultimate Sacrifice released in 2005 states that the Mafia ordered the assassination of John F. Kennedy and that Lee Harvey Oswald was a CIA agent and patsy.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} {{weeks leading up to}} the caucuses, a {{majority}} of the candidates spent a large amount of time campaigning in the state, with Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry touring the state on their own respective bus tours. Bachmann visited all 99 of the state's counties in a ten-day sweep through the state. Other candidates, including Ron Paul, <b>Newt</b> <b>Gingrich</b> <b>and</b> Rick Santorum, also held several events throughout the state to meet with voters. Mitt Romney also visited the state, but spent most of December focusing his efforts on the New Hampshire primary instead. Jon Huntsman also decided to focus on the New Hampshire primary, and did not campaign in Iowa.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the 2008 presidential election, {{when many}} of the {{potential}} candidates had announced their bids by February 2007, the only major candidate to announce their intentions {{as to whether they}} would form an exploratory committee for President of the United States was businessman Herman Cain on January 12, 2011, after having toured Iowa, speaking to various Republican Party groups and leaders, as well as leaders in the Tea Party movement. The first official visit to Iowa by Cain, as a presidential candidate, was on March 7, 2011, during a conference hosted by the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition, along with former Speaker of the House <b>Newt</b> <b>Gingrich</b> <b>and</b> former Governor Buddy Roemer, who also announced their own exploratory committees to run for president four days earlier.|$|E

50|$|The {{incident}} was controversial {{and was a}} part of the increasing partisan infighting that has plagued the Congress ever since.

50|$|CNN {{announced}} on June 26, 2013, that Cupp would join {{a new version}} of Crossfire re-launching in the fall of 2013, with panelists <b>Newt</b> <b>Gingrich,</b> Stephanie Cutter, <b>and</b> Van Jones.

25|$|On Saturday, August 13, 2011, {{the straw}} poll was {{conducted}} on the campus of Iowa State University at the Hilton Coliseum in Ames, Iowa, with Bachmann narrowly defeating Paul, and former Governor Tim Pawlenty in third place. The 2011 straw poll had the second highest turnout in history, second only to 1999 straw poll, when then-Governor George W. Bush won in a landslide. Governor Rick Perry, who announced the day of the straw poll in South Carolina, but whose name did not appear on the ballot, received a significant amount of write-in votes, placing in sixth. Other non-participating candidates, such as Mitt Romney, <b>Newt</b> <b>Gingrich,</b> <b>and</b> former Governor of Utah Jon Huntsman, performed poorly in the straw poll, placing a distant seventh, eighth, and ninth respectively.|$|E
25|$|His {{subsequent}} book, {{released in}} summer 2006, is titled Conservatives without Conscience, {{a play on}} Barry Goldwater's book The Conscience of a Conservative. In it, he asserts that post-Goldwater conservatism has been co-opted by people with authoritarian personalities and policies, citing data from Bob Altemeyer. According to Dean, modern conservatism, specifically in the Christian Right, embraces obedience, inequality, intolerance, and strong intrusive government, {{in stark contrast to}} Goldwater's philosophies and policies. Using Altemeyer's scholarly work, he contends that there is a tendency toward ethically questionable political practices when authoritarians are placed in positions of power, and that the current political situation is dangerously unsound because of it. Dean cites the behavior of key members of the Republican leadership, including George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Tom DeLay, <b>Newt</b> <b>Gingrich,</b> <b>and</b> Bill Frist, as clear evidence of a relationship between modern right-wing conservatism and this authoritarian approach to governance. He places particular emphasis on the abdication of checks and balances by the Republican Congress, and of the dishonesty of the conservative intellectual class in support of the GOP, {{as a result of the}} obedience and arrogance innate to the authoritarian mentality.|$|E
25|$|Watts ran for Congress in 1994 {{to succeed}} Dave McCurdy, who had {{announced}} his retirement from the House of Representatives {{to run for the}} Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform, and opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending. After a hard-fought primary campaign against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49percent to Apple's 48percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston. Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92percent name recognition in one poll. Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Senator Bob Dole, and Minority Whip <b>Newt</b> <b>Gingrich</b> <b>and</b> focused on welfare reform and the necessity of capital formation and capital gains, as well as a reduction in the capital gains tax as beneficial for urban blacks. Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race, but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts' established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win. On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52percent of the vote as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction. He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House. Oklahoma's Fourth District at the time was 90percent white and had been represented by Democrats since 1922.|$|E

50|$|There {{has been}} debate on whether fair value {{accounting}} {{contributed to the}} crisis or simply was the messenger of the crisis. The opponents of fair value believe it is the contributor to the crisis. Opponents, such as FDIC chairman William Isaac <b>and</b> House Speaker <b>Newt</b> <b>Gingrich,</b> lobbied <b>and</b> urged for the suspension of mark-to-market accounting. Clearly, the lobbying has been an issue of debate as well - one that proponents are not pleased with, as lobbying the FASB presents an issue of its independence.|$|R
