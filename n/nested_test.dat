Evidence from fossils in situ and from the shape of Cloudina suggests that this interpretation is incorrect. Rather, I propose that Cloudina lived on seaweeds in the reef environment.

Using simulated data we study how the selection method performs when there is both uncorrelated and correlated noise in the measurements.

The paper tries to explain the observed changes in PPPs. Consistently with the Balassa-Samuelson model, evidence is found of a"dynamic Penn effect,"whereby more rapidly growing economies experience steeper increases in their price level index. This effect has been even stronger for initially poorer countries. Thus the widely-observed static (cross-sectional) Penn effect has been attenuated over time.

Following training, the workload was set at 10 Ns, and hens received one <b>nest</b> <b>test</b> per day at 80, 60, 40 or 20 min prior to oviposition, and then one home test per day after 1, 2, 3 or 4 h confinement in the nest pen.

Hens also worked harder for the home pen, showed a lower latency to feed and spent more time feeding after their return as period of confinement increased. The hens' work-rate for the nest pen at 40 min prior to oviposition was comparable with their work-rate for the home pen after 4 h confinement, while their work-rate was at its highest in <b>nest</b> <b>tests</b> at 20 min prior to oviposition.

40|$|This study distinguishes two nonseparable {{agricultural}} household {{models for}} a self-employed farm household. One assumes heterogeneity of farm and nonfarm labor and {{a competitive market}} for nonfarm labor. The other assumes homogeneity of {{the two types of}} labor and a restricted market for nonfarm labor. We compare demand systems that are derived from them, which have different dependent variables and different numbers of equations. We apply a Cox-type test to compare these complicated nonnested systems. Results show clearly that the former is better for Japanese rice-farming households. Comparison of price elasticities for those models verifies the importance of that test. Key words: agricultural household model, Cox-type test, farm and nonfarm labor heterogeneity, internal wage, nonnested models, nonseparability, restricted nonfarm work hours, system comparison. Numerous empirical studies have emphasized the importance of nonseparable agricultural household models (AHM), in which a farm household simultaneously determines its pro-duction organization with its consumption choice (Bardhan and Udry 1999). Those stud-ies devoted their efforts exclusively to show-ing the superiority of a nonseparable model to the corresponding separable one. Further-more, they were able to relate the separable model to a special case of the nonseparable one. For example, Jacoby (1993) tested a re-lation by which the shadow wage is equal to the market wage in the separable model. Benjamin (1992) tested a relation by which the demand for farm labor is unresponsive to changes in household composition in the sep-arable model. Using that simple relation, they used a <b>nested</b> <b>test</b> to make a partial comparison of the two models. 1 However, no studies have compared two nonseparable models to show that one is su-perior to the other.

Researchers using econometric models to ana-lyze consumer demand must decide what para-metric form to assign to a particular demand function. Theory gives little guidance about what these parametric forms should be, but specification choices can affect results; hence results are conditioned on a particular choice of a parametric form. Typically, functional forms are chosen that are both convenient to estimate and are thought to have desirable approximation properties. Flexible functional forms are considered to have such desirable properties and can reduce the specification bias caused by the selection of an incorrect functional form.
