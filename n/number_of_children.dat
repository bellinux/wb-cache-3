5|$|There is some {{discrepancy}} {{regarding the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> born to Richard and Hetty Hawes. Harrison {{claims that the}} couple had two children, while Neace and Harned mention four sons. The 1850 census showed six Hawes children living in the household: four sons and two daughters.

Students at Gujarat University were unable to take examinations, which were cancelled due to the chances of disruption. While other schools in the state had to postpone or cancel exams, it was reported that some schools held examinations under police protection. It was also reported that many students were forced to leave their studies due to lack of funds or to earn a livelihood because they had lost income-earning members of their families.|$|E

5|$|ASL {{originated}} in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has propagated widely via schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken, though reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> of deaf adults. ASL users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority of oral language to sign language, {{compounded by the fact}} that ASL is often glossed in English due to the lack of a standard writing system.|$|E
5|$|Edward I of England {{had a great}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> {{with his}} first wife, Eleanor of Castile, but only one son who survived into {{adulthood}} – the future Edward II (b. 1284). After Eleanor died, the king married Margaret of France, {{with whom he had}} two children: Thomas (b. 1300) and, when the king was sixty-two, Edmund. Edmund was born at Woodstock in Oxfordshire on 5 August 1301, and was therefore referred to as Edmund of Woodstock. Son of the English king, he was also, through his mother, grandson of Philip III of France. On 7 July 1307, before Edmund had turned six, King Edward I died, leaving Edmund's half-brother Edward to succeed as King Edward II.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the {{congregation}} {{changed its name}} to Temple Israel. Its membership grew rapidly, from 914 families in 1944 to over 1,100 by late 1949, together with an increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> in line with the post-war post–World War II baby boom. In 1951 the temple added a new education building, which had 22 classrooms, offices, and a library. That year {{the congregation}} also updated the synagogue's kitchen, added air conditioning for the vestry and auditorium, and the same for the sanctuary in 1953. Ettelson retired the following year, and was succeeded as senior rabbi by James Wax.|$|E
40|$|B-Tree is a tree data {{structure}} {{of the most common}} used in databases and filesystems, that keeps data sorted and balanced. The idea of B-Tree is an internal node can have a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> nodes wihtin some pre-defined range. When data is inserted or removed from a node, its <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> nodes changes. In order to maintain the pre-defined range, the internal nodes may be joined or split. Because a range <b>of</b> <b>child</b> nodes is permitted, B-Tree does not need re-balancing as frequently as other self-balancing search tree. However, B-Tree may waste some space, since nodes are not entirely full. The lower and upper bounds on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> nodes are typically fixed for a paticular implementation. B-Tree kept balanced by requiring that all leaf nodes at the same height. The height will increase slowly as elements are added to the tree, but an increase in the overall height or depth is infrequent. Because B-Tree is designed to have branches in large numbers and contains a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> keys on each node so that relative tree height small. By maximizing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> nodes within each internal node, the height of tree decreases, balancing occursless than often, and efficiency increases...|$|R
50|$|Looking at {{absolute}} <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> under 5 {{affected by}} stunting, {{it is obvious}} why current efforts and reductions are insufficient. The absolute <b>number</b> <b>of</b> stunted <b>children</b> has increased in Africa from 50.4 to 58.5 million in the time 2000-2015. This is despite the reduction in percentage prevalence of stunting, and {{is due to the}} high rates of population growth. The data therefore indicate that the rate of reduction of stunting in Africa {{has not been able to}} counterbalance the increased <b>number</b> <b>of</b> growing <b>children</b> that fall into the trap of malnutrition, due to population growth in the region. This is also true in Oceania, unlike Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean where substantial absolute reductions in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> stunted <b>children</b> have been observed (for example, Asia reduced its <b>number</b> <b>of</b> stunted <b>children</b> from 133 million to 88 million between 2000 and 2015).|$|R

5|$|In a {{preliminary}} survey of nearly 400 seven-year-olds, 45% chose even over odd when asked the parity of zero. A follow-up investigation offered more choices: neither, both, and don't know. This time the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> {{in the same}} age range identifying zero as even dropped to 32%. Success in deciding that zero is even initially shoots up and then levels off at around 50% in Years 3 to 6. For comparison, the easiest task, identifying the parity of a single digit, levels off at about 85% success.|$|E
5|$|In {{most current}} cultures, {{it is more}} typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so. An American study shows {{significant}} correlation between hair length and age, which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women. A significant correlation was also found between women's hair length and hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived physical health. Consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology, {{these results indicate that}} hair length and quality can act as a cue to a woman's youth and health, signifying reproductive potential. The correlation between the woman's hair length and marital status, or <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children,</b> was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair length and age.|$|E
5|$|The Partisan {{attack on}} the camp and their liberation of a {{significant}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> brought the Ustaše to the realisation that this and similar camps for children could not be maintained. In late October 1942, 500 of the remaining children were dispersed to families in the surrounding villages by the Catholic aid group, Caritas. A total of 1,637 boys and girls were taken in by families in Zagreb, Jastrebarsko and surrounding villages. Of the remaining children, 113 were relocated to Bosanska Gradiška. The Jastrebarsko camp was then dismantled.|$|E

5|$|The TRC {{concluded}} {{that it may be}} impossible to ever identify the number of deaths or missing children, {{in part because of the}} habit of burying students in unmarked graves. The work is further complicated by a pattern of poor record keeping by school and government officials, who neglected to keep reliable numbers about the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> who died or where they were buried. While most schools had cemeteries on site, their location and extent remain difficult to determine as cemeteries that were originally marked were found to have been later razed, intentionally hidden or built over.|$|E

In this episode, Mulder becomes obsessed with a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> who have vanished while investigating the bizarre disappearance {{of a young girl}} from her home. In the meanwhile, Scully fears that he is emotionally involved due to his sister's disappearance 27 years earlier. Her fears are heightened when Mulder's mother dies, apparently of suicide.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the most}} recent (July 2015) {{revision}} of the official United Nations World Population Prospects, the world population is projected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, up from the current 7.3 billion (July 2015), to exceed 9 billion people by 2050, and to reach 11.2 billion by the year 2100. Most of the increase will be in developing countries whose population is projected to rise from 5.6 billion in 2009 to 7.9 billion in 2050. This increase will be distributed among the population aged 15–59 (1.2 billion) and 60 or over (1.1 billion) because the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> under age 15 in developing countries is predicted to decrease. In contrast, the population of the more developed regions is expected to undergo only slight increase from 1.23 billion to 1.28 billion, and this would have declined to 1.15 billion but for a projected net migration from developing to developed countries, which is expected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050. Long-term estimates in 2004 of global population suggest a peak at around 2070 of nine to ten billion people, and then a slow decrease to 8.4 billion by 2100.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} unemployment and tax-benefit provisions for families with different <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> over the 1980 s and 1990 s in Australia.

And how can these changing incentives {{be related to the}} labour market activities of parents in these families? To examine these important questions we use tax-benefit modelling techniques on hypothetical families to show that for most of the 1980 s and 1990 s, the Australian tax-benefit system caused considerable incentive problems for low-paid workers, particularly those with several children. However, we also show that of themselves, these incentive problems appear unlikely to be responsible for the consistently high unemployment levels, or low employment levels, found among parents <b>of</b> large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>children.</b> ...|$|R
