5|$|Concern {{with the}} harm of {{separation}} from the mother is characteristic of the belief systems behind some complementary and alternative (CAM) psychotherapies. Such belief systems are concerned <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> effect of the young child's {{separation from the}} care of the mother, but with an emotional attachment between mother and child which advocates of these systems believe to develop prenatally. Such attachment is said to lead to emotional trauma if the child is separated from the birth mother and adopted, even if this occurs on the day of birth and even if the adoptive family provides all possible love and care. These beliefs were at one time in existence among some legitimate psychologists of psychoanalytic background. Today, however, beliefs in prenatal communication between mothers and infants are largely confined to unconventional thinkers such as William Emerson.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic Khmers have a poor {{perception}} of the Vietnamese community, due to persistent feelings of communal animosity from the past history of Vietnamese rule over Cambodia. In 1958, a survey conducted by Donald Willmott upon {{high school students in}} Phnom Penh showed that relations with Chinese were generally rated as friendly, whereas Khmer students viewed their Vietnamese classmates with suspicion. Relations between the Vietnamese and Chinese are considerably better, as both ethnic groups share a close cultural affinity. Chinese males sometimes take Vietnamese wives, particularly in Phnom Penh and eastern parts of the country where there are large Chinese and Vietnamese communities. In recent years, field research carried out by Ehrentraut in 2013 suggested that ethnic relations between Vietnamese have deteriorated <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ethnic Khmer, but also with the Cham and Chinese Cambodians.|$|E
5|$|Homosexuals in Miami {{were not}} well-connected or {{experienced}} enough {{to combat the}} coalition led by Bryant, so they invited two political organizers to the city: Ethan Geto from New York City and Jim Foster from San Francisco, {{both of whom were}} gay. Foster and Geto faced battles <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Save Our Children campaign, but the disjointed and often closeted gay community in Miami. When organizations outside of Florida promoted boycotting Florida orange juice, Jack Campbell disagreed, worried that an economic backlash in the state would work against local gay men and lesbians. Ruth Shack saw the issue simply, as one of civil rights; Geto and Foster agreed. Bob Kunst soon broke away from the campaign to promote the orange juice boycott, and his views were often printed in the newspapers to Geto's alarm.|$|E

25|$|Some historians {{emphasize}} Galileo's confrontation <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> church, {{but also}} with Aristotelian philosophy, either secular or religious.|$|E
25|$|The Greeks use {{one large}} loaf for the Liturgy of Preparation, {{with a large}} round seal on it inscribed <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> square seal {{mentioned}} above (from which the Lamb is taken), but also markings indicating where the portions for the Theotokos, the Ranks, the Living and Dead are removed (see Proskomedie, below).|$|E
25|$|Three other detainees indicted with Ahmad {{were the}} Moroccan Lahcen Ikassrien, and two legal {{residents}} of Britain, Omar Deghayes and Jamil al Banna. Spanish authorities alleged that these four {{may have had}} some involvement, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, but also with planning the later 2004 Madrid train bombings.|$|E

50|$|The main {{character}} of this series is Astra Eltsov who investigates “mystical” crimes where people are concerned <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> finding <b>the</b> criminal, but rather the reason {{and the way to}} protect themselves from curses, bad omens and fatal events.|$|R
25|$|Although {{his works}} were {{banned by the}} {{government}} almost immediately after publication, circulation was widespread, and his thesis proved popular <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> younger officer class excited at the prospects of military rule and Japanese expansionism, but with the populist movement for its appeal to the agrarian classes {{and to the left}} wing of the socialist movement.|$|E
25|$|No {{record of}} Tilney's {{education}} survives. He evidently learned Latin, French, Italian and Spanish because his early works indicate his acquaintance <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> languages {{but also with}} subjects such as law, history, economics and genealogy. There is speculation {{that he must have}} travelled because travel was regarded as a part of one's education at that time.|$|E
25|$|Suspicions slowly {{began to}} arise that {{something}} awry was going on, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Long Island Blackbirds men's basketball team, {{but also with the}} other prominent New York City programs. CCNY were losing games they were supposed to win, as were NYU and Manhattan. The public did not speak outwardly about their suspicions, although police were already conducting an investigation.|$|E
50|$|Gosselin was {{featured}} in the CBC Television series Canada: A People's History {{as one of a}} number of French-Canadians who <b>not</b> <b>only</b> sympathized <b>with</b> <b>the</b> American cause, but was willing to fight for them against the British.|$|R

25|$|Increased {{connectivity}} {{among individuals}} {{has led to}} a greater ability to organise and execute massive gatherings. This has <b>not</b> occurred <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> riots in England, but with other collective gatherings such as the Arab Spring and the Egyptian revolution of 2011.|$|R
25|$|P - Psychoticism/Socialisation: Psychoticism is {{associated}} <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> liability {{to have a}} psychotic episode (or break with reality), but also with aggression. Psychotic behavior {{is rooted in the}} characteristics of toughmindedness, non-conformity, inconsideration, recklessness, hostility, anger and impulsiveness. The physiological basis suggested by Eysenck for psychoticism is testosterone, with higher levels of psychoticism associated with higher levels of testosterone.|$|E
25|$|In 1937 Smart {{took a job}} as {{secretary}} to the noted Mrs. Alfred Watt, head of the Associated Country Women of the World, an international organization for rural women, travelling extensively throughout the world accompanying Watt to various conferences. It was during this time that Smart happened across a book of poetry by George Barker, immediately falling in love <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> poetry, but with the man himself.|$|E
25|$|In most of Europe, the {{earliest}} {{head of a}} secular church {{seems to have been}} the provost (praepositus, probst, etc.), who was charged <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> internal regulation of the church and oversight {{of the members of the}} chapter and control of the services, but was also the steward or seneschal of the lands and possessions of the church. The latter often mainly engaged his attention, to the neglect of his domestic and ecclesiastical duties, and complaints were soon raised that the provost was too much mixed in worldly affairs, and was too frequently absent from his spiritual duties.|$|E

5000|$|Multiple gods, such as {{the pantheon}} of gods in Ancient Greek literature, are {{believed}} to have appeared in this Gemini age [...] probably in Sumer (Mesopotamia).

40|$|Podosomes are dynamic, actin-containing {{adhesion}} {{structures that}} self-organize as rings in osteoclasts. We observe that podosome rings generate tension forces and that osteoclasts migrate by periodically {{moving toward the}} actin-containing structures. Actin dynamics thus <b>not</b> <b>only</b> correlate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cell migration, but drive it...|$|R
25|$|While {{serving a}} {{sentence}} for killing Rachel Argyle, his adoptive mother – a crime he insisted he didn't commit – Jacko Argyle dies in prison. His own widow, Maureen, believed {{him to have}} been responsible. Two years later, the man who could have supported Jacko's alibi suddenly turns up; and the family must come to terms <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fact that Jacko was actually innocent, but {{that one of them}} is the real murderer, and now suspicion falls upon each of them. Christie's focus in this novel is upon the psychology of innocence, as the family members struggle with their suspicions of one another.|$|E
25|$|Cunningham's novel also mirrors Mrs. Dalloway's stream-of-consciousness {{narrative}} style (a style {{pioneered by}} Woolf and James Joyce) {{in which the}} flowing thoughts and perceptions of protagonists are depicted as they would occur in real life, unfiltered, flitting from one thing to another, and often rather unpredictable. In terms of time, this means characters interact <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> moment in the time {{in which they are}} living, but also shoot back to the past in their memories, and in so doing create a depth of history and backstory which weighs upon their present moments, which otherwise might appear quite trivial; buying flowers, baking a cake and such things.|$|E
25|$|Looking at the Edwardian ordinal, Dix found {{sufficient}} {{mention of}} the priesthood in the service, the actual formula at the laying on of hands being concerned <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> priestly act of forgiving sins but also with administering the sacraments and sufficient mention of intention in the prefaces to the ordination rites, to {{make it impossible to}} believe that the priesthood was not being conferred and the traditional ministry continued. Nevertheless, he concluded by arguing that, if Anglican authority committed itself to unity schemes that equated Anglican orders with those of Methodists and other Protestants, their action would justify Leo XIII and declare Apostolicae curae to be right.|$|E
50|$|Developmental {{psychology}} is concerned <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> describing <b>the</b> characteristics of psychological change over time, but also seeks {{to explain the}} principles and internal workings underlying these changes. Psychologists have attempted to better understand these factors by using models. Developmental models are sometimes computational, {{but they do not}} need to be.|$|R
50|$|SJRCA17 {{failed to}} pass. SJRCA17 <b>not</b> <b>only</b> dealt <b>with</b> <b>the</b> recall of Governors but every elected {{official}} {{down to the}} municipal level and erected no safeguards to ward off those who would simply wish to recall a Governor {{on the basis of}} being from the opposing party.|$|R
50|$|The single-seat Quicksilver MX <b>not</b> <b>only</b> {{complies}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules, but was in {{fact the}} aircraft around which the rules were developed. The Quicksilver was the most popular ultralight aircraft design when the regulations were first drafted in the early 1980s.|$|R
25|$|With this victory, Germany {{ended the}} World Cup on a high, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 3–1 win over Portugal {{in the battle}} for third place, but also with several awards: Miroslav Klose was awarded the Golden Boot for his tournament-leading five goals, {{becoming}} the first player from the united Germany to earn it, and fellow striker Lukas Podolski won the 'Best Young Player' award. Furthermore, four of Germany's players (Jens Lehmann, Philipp Lahm, Michael Ballack, and Miroslav Klose) were selected for the tournament All-Star Team. In addition, with 14 goals scored, the German side scored more goals than any other team in the tournament. After the tournament, over 500,000 people honored the team by giving them a hero's welcome at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.|$|E
25|$|The {{erroneous}} {{belief that}} Mary Magdalene was an adulteress, {{the wife of}} Jesus, and a repentant prostitute {{can be traced back}} {{at least as far as}} the fourth century. Because of that opinion's acceptance in an influential homily of Pope Gregory the Great in about 591 the historical error became the generally accepted view in Western Christianity. In his homily, the Pope mistakenly identified Magdalene <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> anonymous sinner with the perfume in Luke's gospel, but also confused her with Mary of Bethany, the sister of Martha and Lazarus. Karen King concludes that the discoveries of new texts by biblical scholars, combined with their sharpened critical insight, have now proved beyond any doubt that the disreputable portrait of Mary Magdalene is entirely inaccurate.|$|E
25|$|The {{generally}} widespread {{intolerance of}} the time, as witnessed by the Inquisition, amplified by the conflicts between Protestants and Catholics, left {{no place for}} dissenters. Anabaptists, who took the idea of deriving new societal rules from the direct study of biblical sources even further than the Protestant reformers only into conflict <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> established Churches over the question of baptism {{but also with the}} civil authorities because, not having found any biblical justification, they refused to pay taxes or to accept any authority. Both Catholic and Protestant cantons persecuted them with all their might. Following the forced drowning of Felix Manz in the Limmat in Zürich in 1527, many anabaptists emigrated to Moravia. Antitrinitarians fared no better; Miguel Servet was burned at the stake in Geneva on 27 October 1553.|$|E
30|$|Though {{effectiveness}} of the above models, the heat exchange power <b>not</b> <b>only</b> changes <b>with</b> <b>the</b> temperature, but also has a relationship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> aggregate energy storage, which {{will result in a}} time-varying upper/lower limit of power. However, these models either neglect this time-varying characteristic or this relationship between the power and energy storage.|$|R
