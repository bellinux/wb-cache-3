The current study shows the 25 common waterfowl species, their trend, phenology, and dispersion in Hungary using the data of a ten-year period between the 1996 / 1997 and 2005 / 2006 seasons. The six commonest species were: Anas platyrhynchos, Anser albifrons, Anser fabalis, Anser anser, Anas crecca and Fulica atra. During the ten-year period there were 8 species with about 1000 individuals or less (Anser erythropus, Mergus albellus, Tachybaptus ruficollis, Phalacrocorax pygmeus, <b>Netta</b> <b>rufina,</b> Podiceps nigricollis, Cygnus olor, Mergus merganser).

A strong decrease {{can be seen in}} Anser erythropus, Aythya fuligula, Anser fabalis, Anas querquedula, Aythya ferina, Anas crecca, Mergus albellus, Anas penelope, Mergus merganser, a slight decrease in the case of Anas platyrhynchos and Bucephala clangula. The 25 species were put into six different groups based on their types of phenology: late summer migrating species, species migrating dominantly in autumn, over wintering species, species passing through Hungary dominantly in spring, spring and late summer migrants, species with a stable population. Eco-geographical differences between Transdanubia and the Great Hungarian Plain explain the differences in the dispersion of species: distribution dominance in Transdanubia, dispersion dominance in the Great Hungarian Plain, even distribution.

The first part describes the occurrence of interspecific nest parasitism, in the study area of Trebon between years 1999 and 2008 in three diving duck species (Aythini) : the Common pochard (Aythya ferina), the Tufted duck (Aythya fuligula) and the Red-crested Pochard (<b>Netta</b> <b>rufina)</b> and two dabbling duck species the Gadwall (Anas strepera and the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). The most of parasitic eggs was laid by Red-creasted Pochard and Common Pochard. In this period, inter-specific nest parasitism was recorded in 6. 6 % of nests. The values were compared with the results of studies in the same species between 1975 and 1980. when inter-specific nest parasitism was in 13. 9 % of nests. The difference in rate of nest parasitism is caused {{as a result of a}} decline in breeding populations of the studied species.

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{investigation}} of numbers of broods and ducklings of diving ducks and the individual reproductive success of marked females expressed by survival of ducklings. The studied area was located in fishpond systems of South Bohemian {{in the region of}} Třeboň, Soběslav, Jindřichův Hradec and České Budějovice. Between years 2014 and 2015, there were recorded 139 broods and 963 ducklings of Common Pochard (Aythya ferina), 140 broods and 948 ducklings of Tufted Duck (Aythya fuligula) and 47 broods and 312 ducklings of Red-crested Pochard (<b>Netta</b> <b>rufina).</b> The most important environmental factor influencing their occurrence on the fishpond was water transparency. Brood numbers and numbers of ducklings are affected also by other environmental characteristics, such as water surface area, mean depth, number of islands and presence of surrounding wetlands and open landscape. Monitoring individually marked females Common Pochard and Tufted Duck was carried out between years 2004 and 2015. It was found that the survival rate is the lowest in the hatchlings (from 1 to 10 day after hatching), overall survival probability was 0. 395 for Common Pochard ducklings and 0. 383 for Tufted Duck ducklings. Survival was negatively correlated with distance of duckling movements. The most frequent movements were within 2 km from the breeding fishpond, the maximum distance passed by broods was 5 km.

40|$|Red-crested Pochards (<b>Netta</b> <b>rufina)</b> {{have been}} {{observed}} feeding on plants brought by their mates to the water surface, and this behaviour has been traditionally considered as courtship feeding. In this paper I report on this behaviour and examine its behavioural context. Females fed more frequently than males on plants brought by their mates to the surface, and this behaviour always occurred among paired birds. Individuals that procured the food plants were never observed offering them to their mates, but the latter simply approached the former as they surfaced with plants. The main advantages of this feeding behaviour would be to increase intake rates, {{as well as to}} reduce the feeding costs, as no time is spent searching for food underwater. Intake rates of individuals that procured the food were negatively affected when their mates profited from such food. Probably because of this, individuals that procured the food plants surfaced immediately after the feeding interaction with smaller quantities of food than before. This may be a strategy to discourage some individuals from feeding on plants brought to the surface by their mates, because this would allow the individuals that procure the food to ingest it before others start feeding on the plants. In this light, this feeding behaviour should not be considered as courtship feeding. Depending on whether pair bonds are maintained or split before breeding, this behaviour should be considered either as food sharing or tolerated food theft. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Mediterranean shallow lakes support high {{biodiversity}} but suffer many anthropogenic threats, including {{introductions of}} alien fish. We studied {{the impact of}} introduction of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) to Medina and Zoñar lakes in SW Spain. Both lakes were protected as Ramsar sites because of their importance for waterbirds, particularly the globally threatened white-headed duck (Oxyura leucocephala IUCN Endangered) and common pochard (Aythya ferina IUCN Vulnerable). Two carp introduction events in Medina lake, with total eradication of carp in between, provided {{a unique opportunity to}} study the impacts of carp on the waterbird community (counted monthly from 2001 to 2013, with up to 69 species) and submerged macrophyte cover (quantified with satellite images). A comparison of waterbird abundance before and after carp eradication in the smaller Zoñar lake supported the results from Medina lake. Carp consistently led to the destruction of macrophyte beds and a radical change in the waterbird community. After controlling for the influence of depth fluctuations, the numbers and species richness of diving ducks were significantly reduced by carp, whilst the opposite effect was observed for piscivores such as herons. Negative impacts on O. leucocephala, A. ferina, red-crested pochard (<b>Netta</b> <b>rufina)</b> and herbivorous coots (Fulica spp.) were particularly pronounced. A significant negative impact of carp was also recorded on greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber), black-necked grebes (Podiceps nigricollis), little grebes (Tachybaptus ruficollis) and gadwall (Anas strepera). In contrast, carp presence had a positive impact on grey herons (Ardea cinerea). The ongoing expansion of alien cyprinids in the Mediterranean region constitutes a major threat for waterbirds and particularly for sedentary, threatened taxa such as the white-headed duck and red-knobbed coot (F. cristata). Of 22 key sites for the isolated Iberian population of white-headed duck identified in a European action plan in 1996, at least 14 have since suffered carp invasions. Further development of successful control methods for carp populations is urgently required to support the conservation of waterbirds in the Mediterranean region. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado a las V Jornadas Doctorales de la Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, celebradas en Ciudad Real (España) el 6 de octubre de 2015. Floodplains are {{the most}} {{degraded}} ecosystems over the world because of drainage, aquifer overexploitation, pollution and invasive species. In Mediterranean floodplains these impacts are higher because of the fluctuating characteristics of Mediterranean climate, as occur in Tablas de Daimiel National Park (TDNP), a representative Mediterranean floodplain in Central Spain. After a long drought period, TDNP recovered its hydrological regime, however barely one year later, it lost almost every macrophyte cover, and consequently its herbivorous waterbird population declined. To determine the main drivers of this degradation, ten experimental sets were set up around TDNP in April 2013, consisting of three enclosure plots each addressed for birds (B), fish+birds (F+B) and control. Waterfowl populations were surveyed monthly between June 2010 and April 2014. Stonewort standing crop was harvested in July 2013 and May 2014. Twenty-three physicochemical indicators of water and sediment were measured on May 2013 and July 2013. Herbivorous species (<b>Netta</b> <b>rufina)</b> reached historical records between September 2010 and June 2011, but decreased afterwards. Piscivorous waterbirds (Phalacrocorax carbo) increased their population after 2011. Values of Chara spp. standing crop were significantly higher in fish+bird exclosure plots than in those for birds or controls. Maximum Chara spp. biomass was found in sampling stations with lower values of conductivity and Ca 2 + and higher values of dissolved inorganic carbon and organic nitrogen in water and lower values of inorganic and organic phosphorous in sediment. These results evidence that invasive fishes (i. e. common carp Cyprinus carpio), were the main drivers of submerged meadows decline and, thereby, {{of the changes in}} the waterbird communities. However, hydrochemical and sediment characteristics were drivers of spatial heterogeneity at larger scale. In light of these results, National Park managers started the control of invasive fish populations as an urgent measure to assure the ecological conservation of this fluctuating Mediterranean wetland.

40|$|Floodplains {{are among}} the most {{threatened}} ecosystems world-wide because of multiple stressors, i. e., invasive species, pollution and aquifer overexploitation; the Tablas de Daimiel National Park (Spain) is a clear example of these kinds of impact. This work aims to test whether invasive fish and/or the water and sediment quality are significant drivers of the decline of stonewort (Chara spp.) meadows in the Tablas de Daimiel, investigating how this could explain changes observed in the waterbird community. Bird surveys performed monthly between June 2010 and April 2014 have shown that herbivorous species like the red-crested pochard (<b>Netta</b> <b>rufina)</b> reached historical records between September 2010 and June 2011, but have decreased since then. Piscivorous waterbirds like the great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) and herons increased in population after 2011, however. These changes {{may be due to the}} decline of Chara spp. meadows, connected to overexploitation by herbivores, or to changes in water and sediment quality. To test this hypothesis, we studied the growth of Chara spp. biomass in ten sites of the Tablas de Daimiel, where experimental exclosures were set up to exclude herbivory by birds, and bioturbation and herbivory by fish. Our results have shown that the absence of Chara spp. in the Tablas de Daimiel is mostly explained by presence of invasive fish (i. e. common carp). Moreover, the physicochemical characteristics of the water (lower values of conductivity and higher values of inorganic carbon and organic nitrogen), as well as of the sediment (lower values of inorganic and organic phosphorus), favour the increase of Chara spp., in the absence of the fish effect. These results led the National Park managers to begin the control of invasive fish as an urgent measure to assure the ecological conservation of this Mediterranean wetland.
