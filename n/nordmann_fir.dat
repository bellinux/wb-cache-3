5000|$|Tree {{numbers in}} Denmark hit a peak in 2003-2004 when 14 million Danish Christmas trees were exported. After the EU {{suspended}} agriculture subsidies for Danish Christmas tree farmers the Danish Christmas Tree Growers Association (DCTGA) stated that around 600 farmers had quit between 2005 and 2007. In 2005 Denmark was Europe's leading producer of <b>Nordmann</b> <b>firs</b> for Christmas trees. That year Denmark produced 8-9 million Nordmanns.

In 1999 most of the trees grown in Denmark were Nordmann firs, that year, out of 6-7 million total trees, 1.5 million were Norway spruce, 300,000 were noble fir and the remainder were <b>Nordmann</b> <b>fir.</b>|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Plant Pathology, Washington State UniversityMany fir species (Abies) are {{susceptible}} to Phytophthora Root Rot (PRR). Poor drainage and standing water facilitate pathogen survival, proliferation, and spore dispersal. Disease is caused by numerous Phytophthora spp. that constitute regionally-adapted communities. Survey results of diseased Abies in U. S. Christmas tree farms demonstrated a nearly uniform community profile dominated by P. cambivora on noble fir in the Pacific Northwest, and a more diverse array of Phytophthora species collected from Fraser, Turkish, balsam, and Canaan firs in the Great Lakes and Eastern states. It was concluded that Phytophthora community compositions vary in response to host availability, environment, and anthropogenic distribution of infested host material. Aside from short-term chemical and cultural individual-tree protection, there are few feasible methods for altering the environment to provide perennial disease abatement. An alternative approach is to reform host conduciveness to disease by identifying resistant members of a population {{through the application of}} molecular tools. As a precursor to molecular marker development, a multifactorial study was performed to characterize host phenotypes in response to multiple species of Phytophthora under variable environmental conditions. It was demonstrated that P. cinnamomi and P. taxon kelmania cause greater root damage and more mortality than P. pini or P. cambivora and that disease is more severe at warmer temperatures. Furthermore, it was established that there is a spectrum of resistances among the various species of Abies, ranging from highly susceptible noble and Fraser firs to more resistant Turkish and <b>Nordmann</b> <b>firs.</b> Previous observations of PRR-resistant Turkish fir plantings have indicated that the ability to resist disease is not uniform among seed sources. To test variability among Turkish fir families, a collection of 36 seed sources was inoculated with 5 Phytophthora species under saturated field conditions. Chi square analysis indicated that 4 seed sources were significantly more susceptible; however, mortality of less than 10 % in the most susceptible Turkish fir families in comparison to 100 % mortality in Fraser and noble fir suggested that Turkish fir is a PRR-resistant Abies species. Significantly more disease caused by P. cryptogea in this field study confirmed previous observations of variability in Phytophthora species aggressiveness.

50|$|British {{demand for}} natural Christmas trees is around 8 million annually, with {{about two-thirds of}} {{households}} opting for artificial trees. When a Danish tree shortage in 2006 resulted in only 200,000 of the usual 1 million <b>Nordmann</b> <b>Fir</b> trees to the British Isles, British farmers were forced {{to make up the}} deficit with Norway Spruce, Fraser Fir, and Scots pine. The shortage was a result of a hot summer and a cut in subsidies for growing Christmas trees in Denmark.|$|E
50|$|By 2008 Christmas tree {{production}} in Denmark totalled around 9 million trees and Denmark {{was one of}} Europe's largest producers of natural Christmas trees. By far the most popular species grown in Denmark is the sought after <b>Nordmann</b> <b>fir.</b> Between 1999 and 2007 Danish tree production jumped from 6-7 million trees annually to 9-12 million trees annually. In 2009 the Danish Christmas Tree Growers Association (DCTGA) was convicted in a price fixing scheme that resulted in fines for the association and its executives.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nordmann</b> <b>fir,</b> noble fir, Fraser fir and {{balsam fir}} are popular Christmas trees, {{generally}} considered to be the best for this purpose, with aromatic foliage that does not shed many needles on drying out.

Other firs can grow anywhere between 30 and 236 ft tall. Fir Tree Appreciation Day is June 18.|$|E
5000|$|The Western Mail {{reported}} a 2006 Christmas tree shortage and resultant price increase in Great Britain. The report blamed changes in agricultural policies in Denmark which the DCTGA director Kaj Østergaard stated caused many Danish tree growers {{to go out}} of business.

50|$|A Great Britain {{specific}} 2009 {{shortage of}} <b>Nordmann</b> <b>fir</b> and Norway spruce imports was blamed on a poor pound to euro exchange rate by Chris Irvine, writing for The Telegraph. Horticulture Week blamed the ongoing British shortages, in 2009, {{on the end}} of EU subsidies for growers in Denmark and the poor exchange rate between the euro and pound. The Daily Mail also noted the poor exchange rate in its reporting, as well as the fact that British growers were induced to export their crop by those same exchange rates.|$|E
50|$|In 2007 {{there was}} {{a sharp decline in}} Danish tree production. Production fell from 12 million to 8 million, {{reducing}} export numbers drastically. The United Kingdom, a nation which normally imported about 1.5 million Christmas trees from Denmark, imported 500,000 trees from Denmark. Initially, the shortfall and the resulting price increase, which most specifically affected the <b>Nordmann</b> <b>fir,</b> was blamed on a crisis within the industry from 1998 - 2004. During that time growers planted far fewer trees after overproduction had driven many Christmas tree farmers out of business.|$|E
50|$|Most of the Danish Christmas {{tree crop}} is {{exported}} to Germany, along with Britain, France and the Netherlands. In 2008, importers paid between 85 and 90 kroner (11-12 euros, 14-15 dollars) for each Danish Christmas tree, this represented a 10 to 20 {{percent increase over}} 2007. The year of the price fixing scandal a 2 m <b>Nordmann</b> <b>fir</b> sold domestically for 350 kroner (47 euros, 59 dollars). Right before charges were filed in the 2007 price fixing scandal, one Danish farmer reporter selling 2 m tall trees for 200 kroner ($39) wholesale.|$|E

The Colchic region has high rainfall, averaging 1,500-2,500 mm annually, with a maximum in excess of 4,000 mm, and is home to some of Europe's temperate rain forests.|$|E
50|$|In 1924, the Caucasian State Nature Biosphere Reserve was {{established}} about 72 km east from central Sochi. It occupies about 2,633 km2 and preserves some 85 m-high specimens of the <b>Nordmann</b> <b>Fir</b> (Abies nordmanniana), {{thought to be}} the tallest trees in Europe, and a unique forest formed by English Yew (Taxus baccata) and European Box (Buxus sempervirens). About a third of its high mountain species of plants are recognized as endemic. The area also includes the Sochi National Park (IUCN management category II). It hosted the rare Caucasian wisent, but the last three animals were killed in 1927. In 1940, a group of wisent-American bison hybrids were released into the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve. These hybrids are described as a different subspecies, the highland bison (Bison bonasus montanus).|$|E
