40|$|Although {{consumers}} {{express a}} growing expectation in finding clear, credible {{and easy to}} understand label, presented in food products, studies confirm that European consumers have difficulties in understanding and use nutritional labelling in the format currently existing in the European Union. To overcome this situation, the European Union issued a new food information regulation on the provision of information on food consumers {{to be in force}} from 13 December 2014. The proposal took into account the need to simplify and consolidate the plethora of legal acts on labelling, to accommodate what consumers have shown to need, as well as improving nutrition information in order to help them make informed and healthier choices. The aim {{of this study was to}} understand in depth the largest Portuguese manufactures and retailers’ nutrition labelling practices in the light of the acceptance of the new food information regulation. A qualitative study has been developed and an interview guide was designed through food business operators, taking into account barriers and opportunities for food business operators and consumers face the new nutrition labels. Although the majority of the ten respondents had a positive opinion on a unique regulation, they also addressed the minimum character size, that acts as a barrier to marketing actions, because with this limitation they do not have space to provide voluntary information on the: product (e. g. claims, “kosher”), production method (e. g. organic), package (e. g. PET recycling), and corporate social commitments. Industry operators also worry about the obligation of the country of origin labelling inclusion. Most participants identify a number of benefits for the consumer like: allergen communication in non-pre-packed food, improved clarity of labels, mandatory <b>nutrition</b> <b>declaration</b> and, the harmonisation of rules. However, food operators considered the presence of confusing information, like changes in <b>nutrition</b> <b>declaration</b> (e. g. replacement of “sodium” to “salt”) and origin labelling in processed foods...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{evaluates the}} dairy products labelling in the Czech Republic {{based on the}} requirements of the Czech legislation. It also pursues consumer's taste preferences, their interest and awareness of the dairy products labelling. The theoretical section mentions the history of dairying and the importance of milk products in human nutrition. The following chapters present individual dairy products and it described their production, labeling and division into kinds. The practical section reveals that the dairy products are labeled in accordance with the Czech legislation. The results are presented in the form of photos and tables (mini photobook). This part also examines whether the adult people interest in the dairy product labeling, how to orient in a range of dairy products and which products they prefer. The product evaluation was carried out in two big stores in Jablonec nad Nisou by using photographs. It was found that majority of companies indicates their milk products correctly. Identified deviations were discovered in the labelling of <b>nutrition</b> <b>declaration</b> or allergens. This is a relatively new requirements but very important. The questionnaire was found that 68 percent of people read informations on dairy products voluntarily. Most of the respondents consume especially milk, yoghurts and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Food Composition Databases (FCDBs) are {{important}} tools for epidemiological research, public health nutrition and education, clinical practice and <b>nutrition</b> <b>declaration</b> on food labels. The {{aim of this}} paper is to describe the methodology used to compile a FCDB for the analysis on the dietary intake of an Italian cohort of infants, and to assess its strengths and weaknesses. Dietary data were collected using a 3 -DD records compiled at 6, 9 and 12 months of age of the infants. We developed a FCDB that contains data from the Italian and the USDA food composition databases and other sources. Our FCDB includes 563 food derived from the analysis of 623 3 -DD records. Non-commercial products are more consumed than commercial products (25. 5 % vs. 9. 1 % at 6 months, 58. 4 % vs. 18. 1 % at 9 months and 77. 8 % vs. 11. 3 % at 12 months) but the latter are the main source of missing data (> 70 % in each database, with the exception of the energy components), which is one of the major weaknesses of this tool. An integrated system of data collection (NUTRIRETE. lab) that brings together food composition data from public and private laboratories will allow us to build a more complete and representative food composition database...|$|E
40|$|This {{work offers}} an anthropological {{analysis}} of intra-household processes underlying gender-and age-specific differences in individual nutritional {{and health care}} allocations and outcomes in particular cultures. Based on recent ethnographic studies in India, Nepal, Madagascar, Mexico, and Peru, correspondences are analyzed between local cultural ("emic") and scientist-policy maker-practitioner ("etic") understandings of nutrition, health, and human development, and the relative "values" of females, males, and children of different ages. The data and analyses clarify specific epidemiological and demographic findings on age and gender bias in nutrition and health and highlight the multiple cultural, economic, and biological {{factors that contribute to}} gender- or age-based discrimination or neglect. Recent advances in nutrition policy have argued for a broader concept of nutritional security, one that incorporates both food quantity and quality, and of nutrition as "food, health, and care" (International Conference on <b>Nutrition,</b> World <b>Declaration</b> and Plan of Action for Nutrition, FAO/WHO, Rome, 1992). These ethnographic findings lend strong support for such broader nutrition concepts and associated nutrition policies. The studies also suggest ways in which anthropological questions, methods, and data and community-based research can help predict or identify the nutritionally vulnerable within households and help other social and medical scientists design more effective interventions.

40|$|The International Union of <b>Nutrition</b> Science’s Giessen <b>Declaration</b> {{calls for}} a new {{nutrition}} science that extends beyond a ‘biological science’ to include a comprehensive understanding of ‘how food is grown, processed, distributed, sold, prepared, cooked and consumed’. “Food literacy” is an emerging term used to describe this. However, despite their being a strong call for action from practitioners, government, researchers and the public, there is significant ambiguity around what this actually means {{and its relationship to}} nutrition. A Delphi study of 43 Australian food experts from diverse sectors and settings explored what food literacy is, what its components are and how it relates to nutrition. The three round Delphi began with a semi-structured telephone interview and was followed by two online surveys. Grounded theory was used to develop a conceptual model of the relationship between food literacy and nutrition. The model was then tested and refined following a phenomenological study of consumers using the example of young people leaving home for the first time. It is proposed that food literacy influences nutrition through three related mechanisms of security, choice and pleasure. These mechanisms will be mediated by the local food supply and individual values. The relative importance of components of food literacy will depend upon these mediators. The level of nutrition outcome being sought (e. g. dietary guidelines vs food group serves) will also influence the relative importance of these components. This model is useful in guiding investment and practice...|$|R
40|$|The current {{rules on}} food {{labelling}} were first introduced in 1979 {{and while they}} were amended and consolidated over the years, market conditions, eating habits and consumer expectations have changed considerably since their publication. Work on a major revision of the rules began in the European Union (EU) some time ago and culminated in the publication in the EU Official Journal on 22 nd November, 2011 of Regulation No (EU) 1169 / 20111 on the provision of food information to consumers. This new Regulation which replaces the current rules, sets out the requirements {{for the provision of}} food information to the consumer as well as setting out the requirements with regard to the provision of nutrition information on foodstuffs. The Regulation came into effect on 13 th December, 2011. It will apply from 13 th December, 2014, with the exception of point (l) of Article 9 (1) (mandatory <b>nutrition</b> <b>declaration),</b> which will apply from 13 th December, 2016, and Part B of Annex VI (specific requirements regarding the designation of minced meat), which will apply from 1 st January, 2014. This new Regulation maintains the original objectives and the core components of the current labelling legislation, but does introduce some new requirements in order to ensure easier compliance and greater clarity for stakeholders, as well as modernising the legislation to take account of new developments in the field of food information. The purpose of this document is to highlight the new elements of the Regulation. It should be noted however, that many of those elements require implementing rules to be published by the EU or may require guidance from the EU Commission. This document will be updated to take account of any such publication or guidance from the Commission...|$|E
