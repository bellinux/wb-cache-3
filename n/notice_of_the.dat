5|$|Before the Crimean War, {{there was}} no {{official}} standardised system for recognition of gallantry within the British armed forces. Officers were eligible for an award {{of one of the}} junior grades of the Order of the Bath and brevet promotions while a Mention in Despatches existed as an alternative award for acts of lesser gallantry. This structure was very limited; in practice awards of the Order of the Bath were confined to officers of field rank. Brevet promotions or Mentions in Despatches were largely confined to those who were under the immediate <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commanders in the field, generally members of the commander's own staff.|$|E
5|$|CANBAT 1 was {{expected}} to deploy one mechanised company each to the JORDBAT and the NEPBAT AORs to position themselves defensively. The forces would attempt to deter the HV from advancing, demonstrate its resolve to defend Sector West, engage the HV with antitank weapons and mortars, protect the Jordanian and Nepalese withdrawal and withdraw {{under the protection of}} CANBAT 1. The two companies required eight hours <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HV advance to reach their designated positions in time. Presumably, the ARSK would retrieve its heavy weapons from the UNPROFOR storage by force and resist the HV.|$|E

5|$|Gaga further {{clarified}} {{the ideas}} behind The Fame, and her inspirations and visions for the album.

Hence she hoped that people would take <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> performance art, which she was trying to bring back with the album and its music; according to her, the music put the lifestyle in front of it.|$|E

5|$|After {{a four-month}} investigation, the {{criminal}} justice branch of the Attorney General of British Columbia announced formal charges of assault causing bodily harm against Bertuzzi on June 24, 2004. With the charge, Bertuzzi faced up to one-and-a-half years in prison. Bertuzzi pleaded guilty to the assault charge on December 22 after arranging a plea bargain with prosecutors. He was given a conditional discharge requiring 80 {{hours of community service}} and one year's probation that additionally prohibited him from playing in any hockey game Moore was competing in. Under Canadian law, Bertuzzi's successful completion of his probationary period precluded him from a criminal record. Moore expressed disappointment regarding Bertuzzi's discharge and was upset that he was unable to attend the court date, having to issue a written victim statement instead. Moore's lawyer, Tim Danson, was given one day's <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court date following Bertuzzi's plea bargain, which he said was insufficient time for Moore to travel to Vancouver.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Edward Robert Gilligan (23 December 1894– 5 September 1976) was an English cricketer who captained the England cricket team {{nine times}} in 1924 and 1925, winning four Test matches, losing four and drawing one. In {{first-class}} cricket, he played as an amateur, mainly for Cambridge University and Sussex, and captained the latter team between 1922 and 1929. A fast bowler and hard-hitting lower order batsman, Gilligan completed the double in 1923 {{and was one}} of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year for 1924. When his playing career ended, he held several important positions in cricket, including that of England selector and president of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). A popular figure within cricket, he was widely regarded as sporting and friendly. During his playing days, Gilligan {{was a member of the}} British Fascists. He came to the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian secret service during the 1924–25 MCC tour, and it is possible he helped to establish small fascist groups in Australia. It is unknown how long he remained a member, but the organisation practically ceased to exist by 1926.|$|E

He later taught there at the same institute {{as a professor of}} theoretical physics between 1912 and 1914 before he left for Berlin. In 1901, after being stateless for more than five years, Einstein acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1905, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of Zürich.

5|$|For {{the next}} four years, Washington worked {{surveying}} land in Western Virginia and for the Ohio Company, a land investment company funded by Virginia investors. He came to the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new lieutenant governor of Virginia Robert Dinwiddie, thanks to Lawrence's position as commander of the Virginia militia. He was hard to miss; at over six feet, he was taller than most of his contemporaries. In October 1750, Washington resigned his position as an official surveyor, though he continued to work diligently {{over the next three}} years at his new profession. He continued to survey professionally for two more years, mostly in Frederick County, before receiving a military appointment as adjutant for southern Virginia. By 1752, Washington completed close to 200 surveys on numerous properties totaling more than 60,000 acres. He continued to survey at different times throughout his life and as late as 1799.|$|E
5|$|From about 1040, Shen's {{family moved}} around Sichuan {{province}} {{and finally to}} the international seaport at Xiamen, where Shen's father accepted minor provincial posts in each new location.

Shen Kuo took <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various towns and rural features of China as his family traveled, while he became interested during his youth in the diverse topography of the land. He also observed the intriguing aspects of his father's engagement in administrative governance and the managerial problems involved; these experiences had a deep impact on him as he later became a government official. Since he often became ill as a child, Shen Kuo also developed a natural curiosity about medicine and pharmaceutics.|$|E

5|$|If the Council {{does make}} an adverse report, Parliament may amend {{the bill to}} rid it of any {{differentiating}} measures before sending {{it back to the}} Council for inspection.

5|$|In July 1944 Farkas was Commander of the Hungarian VI Army Corps, {{which had}} been garrisoned at Debrecen. He {{replaced}} General Beregfy, who was loyal to the fascist Arrow Cross Party. During that month, Farkas' VI Army Corp was instrumental in repelling a Red Army attack across the Carpathian mountains. On 15 October 1944, Farkas was named commander of the Pest bridgehead and Government Commissioner for Evacuation. In early November 1944, the first Russian units appeared on the southeastern edge of Budapest. As an associate of Farkas, Bánáthy likely had advance <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian advance. He also knew he would likely be executed if captured.
