40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the explanation for young children's failure on Piagetian concrete-operations tests. The issue is of considerable importance because it relates directly to the process by which a child becomes capable of concrete-operational thinking. We investigate a claim that, contrary to Piaget's view, young children may fail on the tests because they are misled about the reference of the critical questions by the non-verbal communicative contexts. It is suggested that young children could be in the habit of giving only non-literal interpretations to test instructions. Nonliteral interpretations are constructed primarily {{on the basis of what}} the context of utterance suggests. Where these interpretations do not correspond with the intended literal interpretation of experiment¬ er's meaning, the children will be misled about the reference of the test instructions and will give incorrect responses based on the incorrect interpretations. We try to account for young children giving only non-literal interpretations in terms of the evidence that children depend on their sensitivity to social situations for the development of language, and for responding to linguistic expressions which are only partially grasped. We review studies by McGarrigle and Donaldson (1975) and McGarrigle, Grieve and Hughes (1978) who proposed that situational clues cause young children to give incorrect interpretations and incorrect responses in the Conservation and Class Inclusion tests respectively. We report experiments carried out to further investigate the new account. These experiments involved a test (Tower test) which was new but which was similar to one of the Piagetian tests (Conservation test) in design. The young children studied "behaved in the manner predicted "by the new account of their failure, giving considerable weight to what the situation of the test suggested about the experimenter's intention for the critical question asked. This resulted in responses which we termed Yes-responses. The responses given where less weight was assigned to the situational suggestion were termed <b>No-responses.</b> The results of a later experiment showed that the same children who give the supposedly more context-dependent non-conserving responses on the Conservation test are the ones who give Yes-responses on the new test. Similarly, the children who give conserving responses on the Conservation test are more likely to give <b>No-responses</b> on the new test. However, our final experiment led to the important discovery that young children do not assign preferential weight to situational suggestions where the expression to be interpreted has more determinate reference than the ones encountered in the Tower test or the conservat¬ ion question. This result indicated that the key to the children's difficulty might reside in the particular expressions used in these tests - the deictic term 'them' (Tower test) and the quantitative term 'more' (Conservation test) which behaves in a manner similar to deictics. In the conclusions, we propose an account of the developmental transition from non-conserving to conserving responses in terms of our speculations about the change from Yes-responses on the Tower test to <b>No-responses.</b> This account centres on the indeterminacy surrounding the key expressions in these tests and explains the developmental change by appealing both to a decreasing reliance on non-verbal clues and to a restriction of the indeterminacy of these terms imposed on them by the five-year old child...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few years the Italian electoral {{abstention}} is growing up very quickly and in the North-east, even if the levels are particularly low, the increasing rate is (in relative terms) particularly high. The results presented in this paper are taken from a survey based on 510 open interviews to election abstainers from North-east (only voluntary abstention is considered in this research). The role of age is very important in understanding the reasons of the abstention choice: young abstainers want to take politics out of their lives and are definitely disinterested on elections’ results, while adult ones decide to abstain either because are tired and disappointed of politicians or to protest and communicate anger by means of a “no-communication”. In the analysis of the politic (auto) collocation of our respondents, we can see that the Center is close to Center-Right and far from Center-Left. This result confirms the existence of a problem of identity in the Center - Left.

Students in Japan (N= 163), China (N= 243), and South Korea (N= 232) were administered the Gunma Prefecture Achievement Test which was translated into Chinese and Korean. Students were given 50 minutes to answer, and responses were evaluated based on a scoring rubric. Students were assigned to groups by ability (Low, Middle, High), and proportions of correct and unanswered responses of the test were analyzed by groups. Results found that Japanese students had the highest proportion of correct answers for multiple-choice items. However, they had the lowest proportion of correct answers and the highest proportion of <b>no-response</b> in a written response question citing a concrete example. In contrast, South Korean students had the highest proportion of correct answers for these items, and Chinese students had the lowest proportion of <b>no-response.</b> It was found that there were high proportions of <b>no-response</b> for Japanese and Korean low group in a written response question which required filling in conversational sentence text. However, Korean low group made more <b>no-response</b> than Japanese for this item.

40|$|International audienceAge-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{is characterized by}} a central vision loss. We explored the relationship between the retinal lesions in AMD patients and the processing of spatial frequencies in natural scene categorization. Since the lesion on the retina is central, we expected preservation of low spatial frequency (LSF) processing and the impairment of high spatial frequency (HSF) processing. We conducted two experiments that differed in the set of scene stimuli used and their exposure duration. Twelve AMD patients and 12 healthy age-matched participants in Experiment 1 and 10 different AMD patients and 10 healthy age-matched participants in Experiment 2 performed categorization tasks of natural scenes (Indoors vs. Outdoors) filtered in LSF and HSF. Experiment 1 revealed that AMD patients made more <b>no-responses</b> to categorize HSF than LSF scenes, irrespective of the scene category. In addition, AMD patients had longer reaction times to categorize HSF than LSF scenes only for indoors. Healthy participants' performance was not differentially affected by spatial frequency content of the scenes. In Experiment 2, AMD patients demonstrated the same pattern of errors as in Experiment 1. Furthermore, AMD patients had longer reaction times to categorize HSF than LSF scenes, irrespective of the scene category. Again, spatial frequency processing was equivalent for healthy participants. The present findings point to a specific deficit in the processing of HSF information contained in photographs of natural scenes in AMD patients. The processing of LSF information is relatively preserved. Moreover, the fact that the deficit is more important when categorizing HSF indoors, may lead to new perspectives for rehabilitation procedures in AMD...|$|R
40|$|The response-priming {{paradigm}} is frequently employed to study motor control {{by means of}} behavioural as well as psychophysiological methods. In this paradigm, response performance is studied under various preparation conditions, but in all cases participants are generally primed for action. This setting neglects an essential ability of the motor system in everyday situations, i. e. the efficient execution of a movement with and without warning. In this context the present experiment assessed the behavioural effects of a modified response-priming paradigm, in which {{participants were asked to}} execute movements when primed for action, and when the prime predicted that no response would be required. Thirty volunteers participated the experiment, which tested whether the insertion of <b>no-response</b> trials would affect the validity effect, and assessed the differences between invalid trials and reactions performed subsequent to <b>no-response</b> primes. The data showed that the validity effect is not modulated by the added <b>no-response</b> condition, which suggests that movement preparation mechanisms can be studied with this particular task. In addition, responses in invalid trials were substantially different from responses executed after <b>no-response</b> primes. These results are interpreted in relation to psychophysiological evidence on advance movement preparation. It is proposed that the performance differences between response- and <b>no-response</b> priming conditions may be due to different preactivations of motor regions evoked by the prime stimuli, a hypothesis to be addressed with psychophysiological measures in the future.

40|$|Background and Purpose: We {{conducted}} {{this study}} to define {{the relationship between the}} hyperventilation-induced EEG changes (HV-EEG changes) and PCO 2 Methods: In consecutive EEG recordings of 190 patients, we gathered data on PCO 2 during the hyperventilation procedure. The data included baseline PCO 2 (B-PCO 2), PCO 2 after 5 min of hyper-ventilation (5 min-PCO 2), the mean value of the PCO 2 (M-PCO 2), and the difference between B-PCO 2 and 5 min-PCO 2 (ΔPCO 2). We divided the enrolled patients into two groups by hyperventilation response (response group and <b>no-response</b> group), presence of epilepsy (epileptic group and non-epileptic group) and age (child-adolescent group and adult group) repeatedly. We compared the four variables between the two groups in each pair. Results: ΔPCO 2 was 14. 2 ± 5. 0 mmHg (mean±SD) in response group (n= 48) and 12. 4 ± 5. 0 in <b>no-response</b> group (n= 142; p= 0. 033) for all the patients.

Yet, {{we do not}} know exactly how aging may alter sensorimotor functions and therefore, its actual impact on safety. This paper aimed to assess to which extent elderly drivers are sensitive to various task loads and how this could impact reaction time with application to driving. Old and middle-aged people completed reaction time tasks (RT) close to those drivers usually have to manage while driving. We requested the participants to detect and respond to traffic lights or a traffic light arrows as quickly as possible during three experimental conditions of increasing difficulty. We expected that decision-making should be impacted through RT by manipulating the number of cues to be processed in both groups. The first test was a simple RT-task. The second and third tests were choice reaction time tasks requiring the processing of three or five information respectively. Responses had to occur within a 2 s time-window, otherwise the result was considered a <b>no-response.</b> We showed that RT, error rate and <b>no-response</b> rate increased as a function of task difficulty, in both groups. However, the middle-aged people group outperformed the elderly group. RT {{difference between the two groups}} increased drastically with task difficulty. In the third test, the rate of <b>no-response</b> suggested that old drivers need more than 2 s to process complex information and respond accurately. Both prolonged RT and <b>no-response</b> rate, especially for difficult tasks, may attest impairment of cognitive abilities, related to aging. Therefore, usual driving conditions for young drivers could be complex and stressful for the elderly who should thus be informed about the effects of normal aging upon driving with simple recommendations and advices...|$|E

Summary: “This paper addresses the inverse obstacle scattering problem. In recent years several non-iterative methods have been proposed to reconstruct obstacles (penetrable or impenetrable) from near or far field measurements. In chronological order, we cite among others the linear sampling method, the factorization method, the probe method and the singular sources method. These methods use differently the measurements to detect the unknown obstacle and they require the use of many incident fields (i. e. the full or a part of the far field map). More recently, two other approaches have been added. They are the <b>no-response</b> test and the range test. Both of them use fewer incident fields to detect some information about the scatterer. All the mentioned methods are based on building functions depending on some parameter. These functions share the property that their behaviors with respect to the parameter change drastically. The surface of the obstacle is located at most in the interface where these functions become large. The goal of this work is to investigate the relation between some of the non-iterative reconstruction schemes regarding the convergence issue. A given method is said to be convergent if it reconstructs a part or the entire obstacle by using few or many incident fields respectively. For simplicity we consider the obstacle reconstruction problem from far field data for the Helmholtz equation. ...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY <b>No-response</b> to {{antiviral}} {{therapy was}} observed {{in the majority of}} chronic hepatitis C patients treated with interferon alpha (IFN-a) monotherapy, but continues to represent a frequent problem even after treatment with newer, more potent, combination regimens. Non-responding patients represent a fairly heterogeneous group. Subgroups of nonresponders with biochemical but without virological response, or with breakthrough phenomena during therapy probably have a relatively more favorable prognosis. Retreatment with consensus IFN may be relatively effective, while the combination of IFN-a in usual dosage and ribavirin (RIB) achieves sustained virological response in 13 % and 21 % of such patients treated for 6 and 12 months, respectively. Induction courses of IFN-a in combination with RIB have been found to achieve initial virological response in 36 - 40 % and sustained virological response in 17 - 26 %. Triple antiviral therapy with IFN-a, RIB and amantadine has also been used, but more trials are needed for firm conclusions. Recently, the combination of pegylated IFN-a plus ribavirin was reported to achieve initial virological response in 36 - 40 % of patients non-responding to IFN-a monotherapy or to a combination of IFN-a plus ribavirin. Extensive data suggest that therapy with IFN-a may delay the progression of fibrosis and decrease the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma even in non-responding chronic hepatitis C patients. Thus, the decision whether or not to discon-tinue the antiviral therapy in non-responders is related to whether therapy aims the clearance of the virus or just a histological benefit.

The paper discusses potential uses of the scores and examines the inclusion or exclusion of <b>no-response</b> items (where the individual did not give a response), the optimal number of data items to include in an enrollment management score, and other characteristics of the scores...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The {{ability of}} {{northern}} goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) {{to persist in}} intensively managed and selectively harvested forest habitats is largely unknown. To address the concern that populations of northern goshawks in eastern Oregon may be declining in response to habitat alteration, I studied occupancy rates and habitat relationships of nesting goshawks on the Fremont National Forest and adjacent private lands during 1992 - 1994. My objectives were to determine if historic territories (i. e., those occupied ≥ 1 season during 1973 - 1991) were still occupied, document current site conditions and quantify changes in forest cover on those territories between 1973 - 1994, and compare present conditions of forest vegetation between nest sites that were currently occupied and those where I did not detect the presence of territorial goshawks (<b>no-response</b> sites). In 1994, I surveyed a forest-wide random sample of 51 historic nest sites, stratified by forest cover type. Occupancy of historic sites by goshawks was 29...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the correlation between the constitution of Sasang and the bee venom hypersensitive reaction, as well as the hypersensitive reaction occurrence ratio between males and females, for patients treated with sweet bee venom (SBV) and who had undergone an examination of the constitution of the Sasang. Methods: All 81 patients enrolled in the study were treated with SBV and underwent an examination of the constitution of Sasang from January 2010 to July 2012. We divided them into two groups for the hypersensitive reaction and no response and compared the distributions of the Sasang-constitution types for the two groups as well as the hypersensitive reaction occurrence ratio between males and females. Results: No significant differences were found between the hypersensitive-reaction group and the <b>no-response</b> group (p = 0. 390), but the hypersensitive-reaction occurrence ratio was statistically higher in females than in males (p = 0. 001). Conclusions: Hypersensitive reactions do not seem to be related to the Sasang-constitution types, but the possibility of hypersensitive reactions among females seems to be higher than it is among males. ...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral visual {{response}} time {{was measured in}} seven dark adapted subjects to the onset of small (45 ' arc diam), brief (50 msec), colored (blue, yellow, green, red) and white stimuli imaged at 72 locations within their binocular field of view. The blue, yellow, and green stimuli were matched for brightness at about 2. 6 sub log 10 units above their absolute light threshold, and they appeared at an unexpected time and location. These data were obtained to provide {{response time}} and <b>no-response</b> data for use in various design disciplines involving instrument panel layout. The {{results indicated that the}} retina possesses relatively concentric regions within each of which mean response time can be expected to be of approximately the same duration. These regions are centered near the fovea and extend farther horizontally than vertically. Mean foveal response time was fastest for yellow and slowest for blue. Three and one-half percent of the total 56, 410 trials presented resulted in no-responses. Regardless of stimulus color, the lowest percentage of no-responses occurred within 30 deg arc from the fovea and the highest within 40 deg to 80 deg arc below the fovea...|$|E
40|$|Lexical {{decision}} {{is one of}} the most frequently used tasks in word recognition research. Theoretical conclusions are typically derived from a linear model on the reaction times (RTs) of correct word trials only (e. g., linear regression and ANOVA). Although these mod-els estimate random measurement error for RTs, considering only correct trials implicitly assumes that word/non-word categorizations are without noise: words receive a yes-response because they have been recognized, and they receive a <b>no-response</b> when they are not known. Hence, when participants are presented with the same stimuli on two separate occasions, they are expected to give the same response. We demonstrate that this not true and that responses in a lexical decision task suffer from inconsistency in par-ticipants ’ response choice, meaning that RTs of “correct ” word responses include RTs of trials on which participants did not recognize the stimulus. We obtained estimates of this internal noise using established methods from sensory psychophysics (Burgess and Colborne, 1988). The results show similar noise values as in typical psychophysical signal detection experiments when sensitivity and response bias are taken into account (Neri, 2010). These estimates imply that, with an optimal choice model, only 83 – 91 % of th...|$|E
40|$|Aim. We {{analyzed}} the pretreatment natural killer (NK) cell functions {{with the aim}} of predicting the sustained virological response (SVR) or the interleukin (IL) 28 B polymorphism that is strongly associated with the treatment response. Methods. The peripheral NK cells from chronic hepatitis patients with HCV genotype 1 and high virus titers were activated using a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 ligand and IFN-α. The cell surface markers were evaluated using a flow cytometric analysis, and IFN-γ production was evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The genotyping of the polymorphisms in the IL 28 B gene region (rs 8099917) on chromosome 19 was performed on the DNA collected from each patient. Results. The production of IFN-γ was significantly higher in the SVR patients compared with the <b>no-response</b> (NR) patients, whereas the cell surface markers were similar between the SVR and the NR patients. There were no significant differences found in the IL 28 B genotype distribution associated with the production of IFN-γ. Conclusion. Differences in the NK cell functions were observed between the SVR patients and the NR patients, suggesting that NK cells play a potential role in the treatment response independent of the IL 28 B genotype...|$|E
40|$|Past {{research}} has shown that children as young as age 3 years are able to distinguish the difference between mental entities and real objects (Estes, Wellman, 2 ̆ 6 Woolley, 1989). Yet, many children still display persistent fears of imaginary creatures, which they claim are not real. In the present study, a replication-extension of P. Harris, E. Brown, C. Marriott, S. Whittall, and S. Harmer (1991), the researcher examined children 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of imaginary creatures through a brief interview. Children were asked to pretend there existed either a monster or a rabbit in one of two large boxes. Children were then left alone to investigate the boxes, while their behavior was videotaped in the experimenter 2 ̆ 7 s absence. The children were then asked questions about their actions upon the experimenter 2 ̆ 7 s return. Unlike the original, the present study was modified to include the group of children who did not respond to the boxes in the experimenter 2 ̆ 7 s absence. The videotapes were coded by an individual blind to the purpose of the study, and nonresponding children 2 ̆ 7 s behavior was grouped into one of six <b>No-Response</b> categories (Obedient, Scared, Uninterested/Don 2 ̆ 7 t Care, Confused, Unsure of Novel Situation, and Certain the Box is Empty). When asked at the outset, a significant number of children specified they were just pretending about the reality of the creature. Yet during the experimenter 2 ̆ 7 s absence, a significant number of children in the monster condition exhibited behavior characterized as Scared. Other significant <b>No-Response</b> categories included Uninterested/Don 2 ̆ 7 t Care, Unsure of Novel Situation, and Certain the Box is Empty. Of those children who investigated the boxes, the pretend box was approached significantly more quickly than the neutral box. Upon the experimenter 2 ̆ 7 s return, almost half of the children had changed their minds about the presence of a creature in the box and admitted to wondering if a creature actually existed in the box. Lastly, a significant number of children in the present study believed a creature could be generated through pretending. While not everything is consistent with the original study, the present study supports the basic tenets of Harris et al. (1991) and even goes a step further by showing a significant number of children who believe a creature can be generated through pretending. In addition, many children displayed fear or uncertainty about the contents of the box, and often admitted this to the experimenter. Children seem to be tempted to believe in things which they have only pretended are real...|$|E
