5000|$|The MH-1A was {{the first}} {{floating}} nuclear power station, built by Martin Marietta for the US Army in the early 1960s. The reactor was installed in a converted Liberty ship hull and used by the Army from 1968 to 1975 in the Panama Canal Zone. It produced relatively low power output of 10 megawatts compared to the projected 2,300 megawatt capacity of the OPS plants. [...] The much larger concept was envisioned in 1969 by Richard Eckert, the engineer at Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G) tasked with identifying power plant sites. He discovered that {{there were very few}} suitable locations, but most were close to the Atlantic Ocean. Westinghouse began the project in 1970 based on two premises: all nuclear power plants were custom built and designed, and local residents close to the proposed location of a nuclear facility typically took a <b>NIMBY</b> <b>attitude.</b> Therefore, identical reactors mass-produced from a [...] "factory" [...] location could be built quicker and at less expense, and if the power plant was located miles from populated areas (in the ocean), there would be less opposition. The idea was promoted by PSE&G as the Atlantic Nuclear Power Plant. PSE&G ordered two 1,150 megawatt reactors for the project in 1972, and two more the following year for operation in the mid-1980s. OPS decided to locate their production facility at the Port of Jacksonville.|$|E

40|$|Wind {{energy is}} {{expanding}} {{rapidly in the}} United States as the nation’s energy policy objectives increasingly focus on renewables. Public opinion polls show {{that a majority of}} Americans support wind energy development but actual wind farm projects often face intense local opposition. This dichotomy between general support for wind energy but opposition towards siting a project nearby is often attributed to the not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) phenomenon. In this study we employ a discrete choice experiment to investigate public preferences for different characteristics of a local wind farm. We investigate NIMBY by first controlling for characteristics that might cause local opposition, such as seeing or hearing a wind farm from home, and then after considering these effects of a wind farm we examine whether people who favor wind energy display NIMBY resistance. Finally, we estimate compensation requirements for siting a wind farm within sight or sound of someone’s home. Results show that people who somewhat favor wind energy do display <b>NIMBY</b> <b>attitudes</b> since they are predisposed to vote against local wind development even after controlling whether they would see and hear the wind farm from their homes. We do not detect <b>NIMBY</b> <b>attitudes</b> among people who strongly favo...|$|R

This phenomenon used to be explained mostly by the NIMBY syndrome describing the fact people support certain idea or plan at an abstract level but they oppose to its implementation in their own vicinity. The aim of the lesson is to sum up and evaluate contextual, political-institutional, social and other factors beyond the <b>NIMBY</b> <b>attitudes</b> and point out that local opposition to wind turbines has generally more complex, multidimensional and socially-constructed nature...|$|R
40|$|LULU (Locally Unwanted Land Use) and NIMBY (Never In My Back Yard) {{are often}} cited as two major hurdles to {{overcome}} for successful siting of a noxious facility. Among various types of waste in Korea, food waste has been posing a serious problem for its high rate of moisture and salt component (MOE 2001). This has necessitated siting of large scale composting facilities around the country. Although {{there has been an}} increasing number of studies on NIMBY towards siting of noxious facilities, one can hardly find a study on NIMBY attitudes toward a composting facility from an economic perspective. To analyze <b>NIMBY</b> <b>attitude</b> of residents in Cheju City, Korea toward hosting a composting facility, we base our theoretical analysis on the expected utility theory and subsequently use a MNLM (muitinomial logit model) for empirical analysis. This study consists of four major parts: theoretical analysis, data management, MNLM estimations, and interpretation. A theoretical model is constructed by maximizing expected utility: first, a two-choice model, then extending it to a three-choice model to incorporate residents' uncertain attitudes toward a composting facility, providing a theoretical basis for using MNLM model. Our empirical results show with statistical significance that the higher the income, the stronger the <b>NIMBY</b> <b>attitude</b> towards siting a composting facility. Further, it shows that the negative effect of economic benefits on <b>NIMBY</b> <b>attitude</b> is (marginally) stronger than the positive effect of environmental concern, which contrast with what is usually observed in US where the effect of environmental concern dominates over that of economic benefits. Socio-demographic variables included to have the economic variables controlled for are mostly insignificant. Further, from our empirical results is deduced that the residents gave uncertain responses are tilted towards accepting the composting facility...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a survey are {{presented}} describing the attitudes of Australian tourists to micro-generation renewable energy supply (RES) for hotel accommodation. The average positive response rate to all questions was above 50 %, implying a desire by tourists for environmentally friendly accommodation and renewable energy supply. Tourists indicated that they perceived RES to be reliable and expressed a willingness to cooperate with RES initiatives and possible resultant inconveniences. However, there were mixed opinions with regard to consumer willingness {{to pay for the}} product. Of the 49 % of respondents who were willing to pay extra for RES, 92 % replied they would pay between 1 % and 5 %. Analysis of the variation in response due to accommodation type revealed a ‘city’ hotel versus ‘eco-resort’ difference. Likewise, a breakdown of responses according to country of origin indicated that Australians had a more positive attitude to RES than overseas visitors, including Japanese and Americans. While no variation in response was detected according to gender, age had a measurable bearing on response, with older guests returning a higher positive response rate. Visual queue questions querying aesthetic opinions and ‘not-in-my-backyard’ (<b>NIMBY)</b> <b>attitude</b> to RES revealed that there was virtually no opposition to photovoltaics. Opinions regarding wind energy conversion systems (WECS) varied with type and location, with rooftop WECS receiving more acceptance than stand-alone varieties. A high level of visual acceptance was shown by respondents for onshore wind farms located close to a tourist accommodation centre, with less enthusiasm for offshore farms. A strong <b>NIMBY</b> <b>attitude</b> to WECS was not observed among Australian or local respondents...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} several years, as wind energy {{development}} expanded from the plains and west, into rural areas with fewer working farms and ranches and higher population densities, complaints about wind turbine noise have become more common. Initially, based on experience in ranching communities where sound levels of 50 dB and more were easily tolerated, noise complaints were often seen as a surrogate for broader <b>NIMBY</b> <b>attitudes</b> or as the habitual response of local complainers. But {{over the past year}} or two, as it’s become clear that some residents are experiencing genuine annoyance and stress responses to “normal ” wind turbine noise levels, developers have been seeking new ways of working with noise concerns.

Joseph begins to examine this in the case of Chicago, and further qualitative research could examine dynamics of neighbor interactions, level of social ties and integration, amount and quality of services, and lived experiences of the lowest income residents. [...] Additional research is also needed on ways to overcome <b>NIMBY</b> <b>attitudes</b> as a way to achieve meaningful social integration. [...] While mixed income housing offers one strategy for moving people out of neighborhoods of concentrated poverty, the underlying causes of poverty and segregation, such as issues of discrimination and labor market dynamics are not addressed. Finally, better comparative research on unit-based housing subsidy, such as mixed income housing, and tenant-based subsidy (such as the Moving to Opportunity program, Section 8 housing vouchers, etc.) could assess the financial efficiency and social efficacy of these respective strategies for de-concentration of poverty to determine the best continued policy strategy and public investment.|$|R
40|$|The {{wind energy}} debate {{represents}} {{a new kind}} of environmental controversy which divides environmentalists of different persuasions who attach contrasting priority to global and local concerns. Case studies of public attitudes towards existing and proposed windfarm developments in Scotland and Ireland are used to test three counter-intuitive hypotheses derived from previous attitudinal research. These are: (a) that local people become more favourable towards windfarms after construction; (b) that the degree of acceptance increases with proximity to them; and (c) that the NIMBY syndrome(not-in-my-back-yard) does not adequately explain variations in public attitudes. All three hypotheses are supported by this study. Large majorities favour wind power development in principle and in (local) practice. Although some aspects of <b>NIMBY</b> <b>attitudes</b> exist, the surveys reveal an 'inverse NIMBY' syndrome, whereby those with windfarms in their 'backyard' strongly support the technology. The research endorses the view that aesthetic perceptions, both positive and negative, are the strongest single influence on individuals' attitudes towards wind power projects. Comparison of the current institutional factors driving wind energy development with those during earlier eras of hydro-power development and large-scale afforestation emphasizes the need for strategic planning guidance. The potential for using a planning-led approach to windfarm developments by adopting 'Indicative Windfarm Strategies' is discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} European and {{national}} policies have given strong support to renewable energies. The Common Agricultural Policy in particular, {{has been pushing}} farmers to produce renewable energy, both as a contribution to sustainable development and {{as a way to}} achieve better economic results. Energy production from biomass, biogas and biofuel cultivated by farmers – agroenergy – is beginning to produce landscape changes. Despite their apparent contribution to sustainability, these new landscapes can be – and often are – contested. The Veneto region, due to the extreme proximity between agricultural and urban land, is a very interesting area for observing new agroenergy landscapes, opposed by nearby residents. Far from being considered simply as an expression of a selfish <b>Nimby</b> <b>attitude,</b> local conflicts question both local transformation decisions and the very principle of agroenergy. Their arguments {{must be taken into account}} if we intend to design a fairer, more democratic “landscape of carbon neutrality”...|$|E
40|$|Land-use {{conflicts}} in facility siting can trigger public opposition in communities. A negative public perception, {{such as the}} Not-in-my-backyard (<b>NIMBY)</b> <b>attitude,</b> is a planning issue that is strongly associated with some types of siting decisions. After the Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) program through the Green Energy Act was introduced in Ontario in 2009, {{a large number of}} wind farm developments were proposed and implemented. Public concerns regarding the noise and aesthetic impacts of wind turbines have created public resistance and caused project delays. More importantly, the wind farm siting decision making process is a top-down process, which overrides the power of municipalities and ignores public concerns towards wind farms. In this thesis, a Geographic Information System (GIS) -based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) siting approach has been developed, which is capable of representing the potential noise and visual impacts caused by wind turbines in a wind farm siting process. After identifying a sample of feasible sites in Southern Ontario, the noise and visual impact assessment approaches were applied to estimate the affected-population by wind farm sites. The changes of suitability levels within each feasible site can be determined after the integration of noise and visual criteria with the common siting criteria, which include physical, environmental, planning and economic factors. This siting approach is generalizable, which means it can be applied to other facility developments that have potential noise and visual impacts to the public. The results illustrate the spatial changes of suitability level before and after introducing the noise and visual criteria into the siting process. Planners and decision makers could potentially apply this siting approach to address public concerns in the future wind farm siting decisions...|$|E

40|$|With the {{anticipated}} increase in energy use and its implication toward sustainable development, Malaysia has put renewable energy {{at the forefront}} of Malaysia's energy policy to address environmental issues such as climate change and fossil fuel depletion. Drawing from successful case-studies from around the globe, Malaysia implemented its own version of the Feed-in Tariff (FIT) mechanism in a bid to achieve energy security and environmental prosperity. After three years of success, the growth of the renewable energy market under FIT is under threat due to the small size of the Renewable Energy Fund. Since FIT is funded by electricity consumers, they would need to make a larger contribution to address the issue. The question remains on whether the Malaysian public is willing to pay more. Previous literatures from Europe suggested that large segments of the general population {{are willing to pay for}} green electricity. More importantly, existing literatures have mixed reviews on whether attitude towards environment affects WTP. Using theory of planned behavior (TPC), the <b>NIMBY</b> (not-in-mybackyard) <b>attitude</b> towards environment was highlighted in several studies, especially in Malaysian literatures. The application of contingent valuation method (CVM) was demonstrated in literatures from Europe and the United States. However, Malaysian literatures lacks the use ofCVM in their WTP investigations. Finally, recommendation for future studies on WTP for green electricity in Malaysia was put forth with an emphasis on the use of TPC and CVM approach.

40|$|The term NIMBY {{stands for}} English Not In My BackYard and {{describes}} {{the attitude of}} people who disagree with location in their closest neighbourhood of both dangerous facilities and facilities resulting in great loss for local people. What is characteristic about NIMBY syndrome, compared to other social conflicts, {{is the fact that}} it concerns facilities (investments) which are seen rather negatively, however, they are socially acceptable and the problem is only about the location. NIMBY facilities are the subject of dispute which is accompanied by the specific – <b>NIMBY</b> syndrome <b>attitude</b> of local society and therefore makes the conflict rather unique among other functional and spatial conflicts. NIMBY facilities are unwanted and perceived to be noxious in a particular location. The conflict seems to appear when the distance between a controversial object and a residential area is too short. The following article is to show specific aspects of NIMBY syndrome and NIMBY facilities in accordance to current research that mainly covered social conflicts in general terms. It must be emphasized that the basis of the analysis was the scientific works which have been predominantly published in English. Polish output has generally dealt with case study, which has been about particular examples of the conflicts in Polish cities. The development of council, collective and private housing industry is a good reason to start doing some research into Polish NIMBY syndrome and facilities.

40|$|In {{recognition}} of the environmental and economic threats posed by climate change; decisive steps are now being taken to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions. One sector receiving particular attention within the UK is that of electricity generation. As such, the government has introduced ambitious targets for increasing renewable generating capacity within the country. Wind turbines are expected to {{play a significant role}} in meeting these targets; however, despite high levels of support for the technology in principle, specific projects are often delayed or rejected on account of local opposition. This study aimed to establish how attitudes towards development might vary with respect to increasing distance from the identified sites. Participants were required to register their opinion towards development at a number of on- and off-shore locations in the UK. The results indicated that participants were most favourable to offshore development and least favourable to development at the identified sites. Attitudes to onshore development indicated that so long as a proposed location was anticipated to be 'out of sight' it was considered in relatively general terms. The results are discussed with reference to site visibility and landscape concerns and clearly support calls for a shift towards community-focussed development strategies. <b>NIMBY</b> Wind farm <b>Attitudes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Proper {{understanding}} of the relationship among concern for the environment, waste separation and disposal can contribute to good waste management and safer environment. This is particularly vital in cities of developing countries (such as Ethiopia) where waste separation is poor and there is widespread illegal dumping, with dire consequences for the environment. In this study, household data are collected in the city of Mekelle in order to identify and analyze the relationship among concern for the environment, waste separation and disposal into communal waste containers. Bivariate probit and Heckman probit selection models are used as tools of analysis. Relevant covariates such as demographic features, waste attributes and environmental attitude are used to get an insight to environmental concern, waste separation and disposal behavior. Results show that the volume of waste generated, <b>NIMBY</b> and NIABY <b>attitudes</b> of households, municipal regulation over the proper use of waste containers and container distance from dwelling houses are positively associated with concern for the environment. Education level of household head, container access, shorter distance to waste containers and household income are found to increase the probability of disposal into containers. In another instance, results indicate that waste separation is positively related with recycling practice, longer container distance, family size and waste attitude. Findings and implications from the relationships can be used to influence and strengthen pro-environment household attitudes and better practices in waste separation and appropriate disposal...|$|R
