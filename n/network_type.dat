25|$|A {{wireless}} network consists of nodes (each {{of which is}} a transmitter, receiver or both, depending on the system) that produce, relay or consume data within the network. For example, base stations and users in a cellular phone network or sensor nodes in a sensor network. Before developing stochastic geometry wireless models, models are required for mathematically representing the signal propagation and the node positioning. The propagation model captures how signals propagate from transmitters to receivers. The node location or positioning model (idealizes and) represents the positions of the nodes as a point process. The choice of these models depends {{on the nature of the}} {{wireless network}} and its environment. The <b>network</b> <b>type</b> depends on such factors as the specific architecture (for instance cellular) and the channel or medium access control (MAC) protocol, which controls the channels and, hence, the communicating structures of the network. In particular, to prevent the collision of transmissions in the network, the MAC protocol dictates, based on certain rules, when transmitter-receiver pairs can access the network both in time and space, which also affects the active node positioning model.|$|E

Some of these plugins are detected as Adware or PUP by many Anti-Virus engines, while the developer, a Chinese company GOMO Dev Team, claims in the apps' description that they will never collect personal data including credit card information. The apps with about 2 million users in total were caught on spying on September 2017 by security researches from AdGuard who then reported their findings to Google.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{link state}} routing protocol, OSPF {{establishes}} and maintains neighbor relationships for exchanging routing updates with other routers. The neighbor relationship table is called an adjacency database. Two OSPF routers are neighbors {{if they are}} members of the same subnet and share the same area ID, subnet mask, timers and authentication. In essence, OSPF neighborship is a relationship between two routers that allow them to see and understand each other but nothing more. OSPF neighbors do not exchange any routing information – the only packets they exchange are Hello packets. [...] OSPF adjacencies are formed between selected neighbors and allow them to exchange routing information. Two routers must first be neighbors and only then, can they become adjacent. Two routers become adjacent if {{at least one of them}} is Designated Router or Backup Designated Router (on multiaccess type networks), or they are interconnected by a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint <b>network</b> <b>type.</b> For forming a neighbor relationship between, the interfaces used to form the relationship must be in the same OSPF area. While an interface may be configured to belong to multiple areas, this is generally not practiced. When configured in a second area, an interface must be configured as a secondary interface.|$|E

40|$|Development {{of network}} {{communication}} in a homogeneous sensor network environment is straightforward as the nodes can share message layouts simply by letting the compiler lay out messages in an arbitrary fashion {{and using the}} same executable code on all nodes. However, this simple approach does not usually work in a heterogeneous sensor network setting because different compilers may generate different message layouts, and different processors often have different basic type representations and alignments. The traditional solutions to this problem is to either require programmers to insert network-byte-order and host-byte-order conversions, or to use a compiler that automatically generates marshalling and unmarshalling routines. Unfortunately, these approaches are inadequate for sensor networks because they are either error-prone and/or add significant overheads to already resource-constrained sensor motes. Instead, we propose a language extension — <b>network</b> <b>types</b> — which supports heterogeneous networking in a simple and efficient way. We have implemented <b>network</b> <b>types</b> in the nesC, {{the language of the}} TinyOS sensor network operating system and its applications. We have used <b>network</b> <b>types</b> to supports heterogeneous networking betweenmicaz andtelos motes (which have different alignment restrictions).

Objectives: The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore the <b>network</b> <b>types</b> of HCBS clients based on the {{structural}} characteristics of their social networks. We also examined how the <b>network</b> <b>types</b> were associated with social isolation, relationship quality and loneliness. Method: Forty personal interviews were carried out with HCBS clients to assess the structure of their social networks as indicated by frequency of contact with children, friends, family and participation in religious and community organizations. Hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted to identify <b>network</b> <b>types.</b> Results: Four <b>network</b> <b>types</b> were found including: family (n = 16), diverse (n = 8), restricted (n = 8) and religious (n = 7). Family members comprised almost half of participants' social networks, and friends comprised less than one-third. Clients embedded in family, diverse and religious networks had significantly more positive relationships than clients embedded in restricted networks. Clients embedded in restricted networks had significantly higher social isolation scores and were lonelier than clients in diverse and family networks. Discussion: The findings suggest that HCBS clients' isolation and loneliness are linked to the <b>types</b> of social <b>networks</b> in which they are embedded. The findings also suggest that clients embedded in restricted networks are at high risk for negative outcomes.

40|$|The initial aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{relationship}} between social <b>network</b> <b>types</b> derived from Wenger’s PANT and health among adults aged 55 - 70 years old in New Zealand. More specifically, it tested the “Mezzo” level of the Conceptual Model of health derived by Berkman et al. (2000), where it was postulated that social contextual factors (gender, education, socioeconomic status and ethnicity) shape the <b>type</b> of social <b>network</b> an individual is embedded in, and these social contextual factors contribute to the relationship between social networks and health. This study used data obtained from the second wave of the New Zealand Longitudinal study of Health, Work and Retirement, which used responses to a questionnaire survey from a representative sample (N= 2430). Bivariate correlations and multiple regression analyses were run to test these associations. However the initial results showed theoretically incorrect correlations between social <b>network</b> <b>types,</b> and a large proportion of the population sample were allocated into “inconclusive” and “borderline” categories. Furthermore, although the social contextual factors clearly influenced the variation in health, the relationship between social <b>network</b> <b>types</b> and health were rather weak, especially in comparison to those found in other studies. Therefore, the study took a turn to examine and rescore Wenger’s PANT. The modification of the measure ameliorated the peculiar relationships between <b>network</b> <b>types,</b> reduced the number of participants in the “inconclusive” and “borderline” categories, but did not significantly improve the relationship between social networks and health. The only <b>network</b> <b>types</b> that contributed significantly to the multiple regression equation were the Locally Integrated and Wider Community Focused <b>network</b> <b>types.</b> Therefore it was speculated that the possible “active ingredient” of social networks may be the aspect of social engagement, where those who have more ties to their friends and community are in better health than those in restricted and family focused networks. This study only showed moderate support for the Conceptual Model. However it did provide evidence towards the need to explore the notion of social engagement and integration, as well as the development of a social network measure that includes perception of network ties, and the functional roles within social networks, not just the structural aspects. ...|$|R
