40|$|In {{research}} {{organizations that}} have been “captured ” by vested interests, the scholars who receive the most attention, praise, and reward are not those who conduct the most accurate or highest quality research, but those who produce results that best advance {{the interests of the}} group. Those who produce results that do not advance the interests of the group may be shunned and ostracized, even if their work is well-done and accurate. The prevailing view among the vested interests in education does not oppose all standardized testing; it opposes testing with consequences based on the results that is also “externally administered”—i. e., testing {{that can be used to}} make judgments of educators but is out of educators ’ direct control. The external entity may be a higher level of government, such as the state in the case of state graduation exams, or a <b>non-governmental</b> <b>entity,</b> such as the College Board or ACT in the case of college entrance exams. One can easily spot the moment vested interests “captured ” the National Research Council’s Board on Testing and Assessment (BOTA). BOTA was headed in the 1980 s by a scholar with little background or expertise in testing (Wise, 1998). Perhaps not knowing who to trust at first, she put her full faith, and that of the NRC, behind the anti-high-stakes testing point of view that had come to dominate graduate schools of education. Proof of that conversion came when the NRC accepted a challenge from the U. S. Department of Labor to evaluate the predictive validity of the General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB) for use in unemployment centers throughout the country...|$|E
40|$|Since 2002, BRAC, a {{non-governmental}} organisation (NGO) of Bangladeshi origin, has gone global. It {{has expanded its}} programme of ‘microfinance plus’ (education, health, enterprise support, etc) to Afghanistan, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Southern Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Pakistan. It has established organisations in the UK and the USA to raise funds and its international profile. It {{is believed to be}} the largest NGO in Afghanistan, is growing fast elsewhere, and has long been the largest <b>non-governmental</b> <b>entity</b> in Bangladesh. BRAC’s global expansion appears to be part of a trend of the ‘South in the South’, marked by the expansion of Chinese business in Africa, but also, it seems, by new forms of Southern {{non-governmental organisation}} transplanted across Southern contexts. This paper explores two challenges of BRAC’s global expansion. The first is the challenges BRAC faces as it seeks to break new ground as the first International NGO of Southern origin to take its programme and managerial expertise to other countries. It is an ambitious agenda. A critical challenge is the need to attract financing and carve out regulatory room for service delivery programmes within new political spaces that are sometimes unfamiliar with and unwelcoming of NGOs on the BRAC scale. The second challenge of the title is the challenge to thinking about NGOs in development: discussions about NGOs in development currently emphasise disappointment with their performance, and a withdrawal, including among aid donors and discourses, from their ‘magic bullet’ heyday of the late 1990 s. While BRAC’s global expansion is facing challenges, its ambitious expansionary programme counters disappointment around NGOs, raising new questions about the roles of NGOs in development.

40|$|A central {{feature of}} the World Trade Organization (WTO) is its Dispute Settlement Mechanism (DSM).

However, <b>non-governmental</b> <b>entities</b> have been afforded a limited opportunity to express their views through the submission of amicus briefs in dispute settlement proceedings. There are concerns, in particular {{on the part of}} Developing Countries, over the Appellate Body's authority to confer such a role to these entities. This paper aims to analyze the issues surrounding the status of <b>non-governmental</b> <b>entities</b> at the WTO level with respect to the DSM, how its Appellate Body is interpreting the law of the WTO, and how far the criticism of Developing Countries towards the Appellate Body's interpretation of WTO law is justified...|$|R
