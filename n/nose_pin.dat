50|$|Before the 19th century, piercings and tattoos {{were very}} common among the Aleut people, {{especially}} among women. Piercings, {{such as the}} <b>nose</b> <b>pin,</b> were common among {{both men and women}} and were usually performed a few days after birth. The ornament was made of various materials, a piece of bark or bone, or an eagleâ€™s feather shaft. From time to time, adult women decorated the nose pins by hanging pieces of amber and coral from strings on it; the semi-precious objects dangled down to their chins.|$|E
50|$|Green with {{lust and}} sick with shyness, Let me lick your {{lacquered}} toes. Gosh, oh gosh, your Royal Highness, Put your finger up my <b>nose,</b> <b>Pin</b> my teeth upon your dress, Plant {{my head with}} watercress. Only you can make me happy. Tuck me tight beneath your arm. Wrap me in a woollen nappy; Let me wet it till it's warm. In a plush and plated pram Wheel me round St James's, Ma'am. Let your sleek and soft galoshes Slide and slither on my skin. Swaddle me in mackintoshes Till I lose my sense of sin. Lightly plant your plimsolled heel Where my privy parts congeal.|$|E
50|$|The {{indigenous}} peoples of Australia {{who live on}} the Pennefather River in Queensland, use (or used) a half-moon shaped nose-pin known as an imina which is made from the shell of Syrinx aruanus. This <b>nose</b> <b>pin</b> is employed by men only; the women use a piece of grass instead. In order to make one of these nose pins, if the Syrinx shell is fresh, then it can be worked on right away, but if it is dried out, the shell is first soaked {{for two or three days}} in water. After this, a portion of the shell which is near the suture and the keel on the body whorl is chipped out using a stone, (see image), and then is ground down with water. The resulting rib-shaped object is used as the nose-pin.|$|E

50|$|An {{electrical}} storm {{approaches the}} bay {{and a couple of}} lightning bolts revive Gamera, who stealthily takes the bathysphere from the sea floor when Zigra is not watching and returns it to the surface. Gamera and Zigra face off a final time and Zigra, using its superior versatility underwater, slices Gamera's chest with its blade-like dorsal fin. Gamera takes hold of Zigra, flies into the air with him and then drops him at high speed, slamming the alien monster onto the land. Zigra stands up awkwardly on his tail fins in order to fight Gamera. Gamera further incapacitates Zigra by jamming a boulder through its <b>nose,</b> <b>pinning</b> it to the ground. Gamera grabs another boulder and uses it, like a hammer on a xylophone, to play the Gamera theme on Zigra's dorsal fins. Finally, Gamera kills Zigra by setting his body on fire with his flame breath, reducing it to ashes in a massive conflagration.|$|R
25|$|When bullbaiting {{became popular}} in England {{due to the}} {{shortage}} of bears, bull baiters soon realized that large fighting dogs were built too heavy and too slow {{for this type of}} combat. When fighting a bull, dogs were trained to grab onto the bull's <b>nose</b> and <b>pin</b> the bull's head to the ground. If the dog failed to do this, the bull would fling the dog out of the ring with its horns. The British therefore decided to selectively breed fighting dogs for shorter legs and a more powerful jaw. These efforts resulted in the Old English Bulldog.|$|R

50|$|On 15 July 2016, Baloch was drugged {{and then}} asphyxiated by her brother Waseem {{while she was}} asleep at her parents' home in Multan. Her death was {{reported}} by her father Azeem. It was first reported as a shooting, but an autopsy report confirmed that Baloch was murdered by asphyxiation while she was asleep, {{on the night of}} 15-16 July, around 11:15 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. By the time her body was found she had already been dead for between fifteen and thirty-six hours. Marks on Baloch's body revealed that her mouth and <b>nose</b> were <b>pinned</b> shut to asphyxiate her. Police said that they would investigate all sides of the murder including honour killing.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the success}} of The Hunchback of Notre Dame in 1923, Chaney was once again given the freedom to create his own make-up as the Phantom, a habit which became almost as famous as the films he starred in. Chaney painted his eye sockets black, giving a skull-like {{impression}} to them. He also pulled {{the tip of his}} <b>nose</b> up and <b>pinned</b> it in place with wire, enlarged his nostrils with black paint, and put a set of jagged false teeth into his mouth to complete the ghastly deformed look of the Phantom. When audiences first saw The Phantom of the Opera, they were said to have screamed or fainted at the scene where Christine pulls the concealing mask away, revealing his skull-like features to the audience.|$|R
5000|$|The {{designation}} [...] "bull" [...] {{was applied}} {{because of the}} dog's use in the sport of bull baiting. This entailed the setting of dogs (after placing wagers on each dog) onto a tethered bull. The dog that grabbed the bull by the <b>nose</b> and <b>pinned</b> {{it to the ground}} would be the victor. It was common for a bull to maim or kill several dogs at such an event, either by goring, tossing, or trampling. Over the centuries, dogs used for bull-baiting developed the stocky bodies and massive heads and jaws that typify the breed as well as a ferocious and savage temperament. Bull-baiting, along with bear-baiting, reached the peak of its popularity in England in the early 1800s until they were both made illegal by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835. This amended the existing legislation to protect animals from mistreatment and included (as [...] "cattle") bulls, dogs, bears, and sheep, so that bull and bear-baiting as well as cockfighting became prohibited. Therefore, the Old English Bulldog had outlived its usefulness in England as a sporting animal and its active or [...] "working" [...] days were numbered. However, emigrants did have a use for such dogs in the New World. In mid-17th century New York, Bulldogs were used {{as a part of a}} citywide roundup effort led by Governor Richard Nicolls. Because cornering and leading wild bulls were dangerous, Bulldogs were trained to seize a bull by its nose long enough for a rope to be secured around its neck. Bulldogs as pets were continually promoted by dog dealer Bill George.Despite slow maturation so that growing up is rarely achieved by two and a half years, Bulldogs' lives are relatively short. At five to six years of age they start to show signs of aging.|$|R
5000|$|The {{brand new}} F-100C was flown by Lt. Barty R. Brooks, {{a native of}} Martha, Oklahoma and a Texas A&M graduate, of the 1708th Ferrying Wing, Detachment 12, Kelly AFB, Texas. The {{aircraft}} {{was one of three}} being delivered from North American's Palmdale plant to George AFB, California, but the <b>nose</b> gear pivot <b>pin</b> worked loose, allowing the wheel to swivel at random, so he diverted to Edwards, which had a longer runway. On approach, at a high angle of attack, the fighter exceeded its flight envelope, and, too far into stall condition, lost directional control with fatal results. These scenes were inserted in the movie The Hunters, starring Robert Mitchum and Robert Wagner, in the movie X-15 with actor Charles Bronson playing the unlucky pilot, and in the Made for TV film Red Flag: The Ultimate Game, although in The Hunters and in Red Flag: The Ultimate Game, the aircraft supposedly represented were respectively an F-86 and an F-5E. The incident was also commemorated in the fighter pilot song [...] "Give Me Operations" [...] (set to the tune of the California Gold Rush song [...] "What Was Your Name in the States?"): ...|$|R
