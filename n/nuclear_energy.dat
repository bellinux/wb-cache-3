A {{detailed analysis of the}} isospin dependence of these two components contributing to the <b>nuclear</b> symmetry <b>energy</b> reveals a quadratic dependence due to the mean-isoscalar potential, ∼ɛT 2, and, completely unexpectedly, the presence of a strong linear component ∼κT(T+ 1 +ɛ/κ) in the isovector potential.
