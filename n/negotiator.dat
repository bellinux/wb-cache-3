In the current study we investigate the negotiation scripts employed by Middle Eastern <b>negotiators,</b> more specifically Iranian <b>negotiators,</b> in an intracultural interaction, compared to North American <b>negotiators.</b> We examine how the Iranian worldviews, beliefs, norms, and social behavior influence their goals and aspirations, negotiation tactics, and ultimately final outcome. We formulated our hypotheses based on the theory of honor-dignity cultures and illustrate how the importance of preserving and maintaining honor influences the Iranian negotiation strategies in business dealings. Our results illustrate that consistent with the culture of honor, Iranian <b>negotiators</b> {{are more likely to}} be competitive, express emotions, and employ distributive tactics compared to Canadian <b>negotiators.</b> Moreover, this competitive mindset leaves Iranian <b>negotiators</b> at a disadvantage as the overall joint gain is significantly lower than Canadian <b>negotiators...</b>|$|R

40|$|Research on {{automated}} <b>negotiators</b> has {{flourished in}} recent years. Among the important issues considered is how automated <b>negotiators</b> {{can be designed}} {{that are capable of}} negotiating proficiently with people.

In this paper we investigate the use of Peer Designed Agents (PDAs, computer agents developed by human subjects) as a method for evaluating automated <b>negotiators.</b> We have examined the negotiation results and its dynamics in extensive simulations with more than 300 human <b>negotiators</b> and more than 50 PDAs in two distinct negotiation settings.

40|$|Bilateral single-issue {{negotiation}} is {{studied a}} lot by researchers as a fundamental research issue in agent negotiation. During a negotiation with time constraint, a negotiation decision function is usually predefined by <b>negotiators</b> to express their expectations on negotiation outcomes in different rounds. By combining the negotiation decision function with <b>negotiators</b> 2 ̆ 7 utility functions, offers can be generated accurately and efficiently to satisfy <b>negotiators</b> expectations in each round. However, such a negotiation procedure may not work well when <b>negotiators</b> 2 ̆ 7 utility functions are nonlinear. For example, if <b>negotiators</b> 2 ̆ 7 utility functions are non-monotonic, <b>negotiators</b> may find several offers {{that come with the}} same utility; and if <b>negotiators</b> 2 ̆ 7 utility functions are discrete, <b>negotiators</b> may not find an offer to satisfy their expected utility exactly. In order to solve such a problem caused by nonlinear utility functions, we propose a novel negotiation approach in this paper. Firstly, a 3 D model is introduced to illustrate the relationships among utility functions, time constraints and counter-offers. Then two negotiation mechanisms are proposed to handle two types of nonlinear utility functions respectively, ie. a multiple offers mechanism is introduced to handle non-monotonic utility functions, and an approximating offer mechanism is introduced to handle discrete utility functions. Lastly, a combined negotiation mechanism is proposed to handle nonlinear utility functions in general situations. The experimental results demonstrate the success of the proposed approach. By employing the proposed approach, <b>negotiators</b> with nonlinear utility functions can also perform negotiations efficiently...|$|R

A standardized questionnaire measuring self-reported influences of different types of external information was developed and administered to a representative sample of union and firm <b>negotiators</b> in the Netherlands. In total, 123 <b>negotiators</b> participated in the survey. Four types of external information were investigated: 1 - economic information; 2 - information on organizational power; 3 - institutional information; and 4 - information spillovers. Descriptive analyses show that economic information, particularly when referring to the sector level, was very influential, as was institutional information on national and sectoral collective agreement developments. Information reflecting organizational power, e. g. militancy, carried less weight, while information on other bargaining events, i. e. spillover, was also very important. From extant theory, empirical findings and common assumptions in labour relations literature, the paper developed and tested a number of hypotheses concerning the influence of external information. It was found that the influence of spillovers increased with the proximity of their source. Union <b>negotiators</b> were generally more influenced by external information than firm <b>negotiators.</b> There was some evidence that influence increased with experience, but this effect was rather modest. Evidence that <b>negotiators</b> in sector bargaining were less affected by the economic environment than <b>negotiators</b> in company bargaining was weak, but they were found to be less influenced by spillovers and international collective agreement developments...|$|R

He demanded to speak with an Arab ambassador, but the <b>negotiator</b> on duty claimed that talks were still being arranged by the Foreign Office. Recognising the delaying tactic, Oan told the <b>negotiator</b> that the British hostages {{would be the last}} to be released because of the British authorities' deceit. He added that a hostage would be killed unless Tony Crabb was brought back to the embassy. Crabb did not arrive at the embassy until 15:30, nearly ten hours after Oan demanded his presence, to the frustration of both Oan and Sim Harris. Oan then relayed another statement to Crabb via Mustapha Karkouti, a journalist also being held hostage in the embassy. The police guaranteed that the statement would be broadcast on the BBC's next news bulletin, in exchange for the release of two hostages.

40|$|By {{conducting}} this theory-based empirical study, {{gathering data}} from working <b>negotiators</b> in the US and Canada, I have determined what primary dynamic activities, communication skills, and negotiation tools {{are used by}} hostage/crisis <b>negotiators.</b> <b>Negotiators</b> implement their negotiation and decision strategies differently {{depending on whether the}} situations they deal with are instrumental or expressive. I have determined which elements of negotiations and factors affecting negotiations differ while handling instrumental and expressive hostage situations. I found that the collected data did not reveal any significant relationship between handling instrumental/expressive hostage situations differently and belief in the elements of Brenda Dervin's and Shannon-Weaver's theories. I have also determined that the belief in the elements of the Dervin's and Shannon-Weaver's theories is workable and practical for <b>negotiators</b> to use. Based on the above findings, the model suggested by this research adds the elements and directives of Dervin's and Shannon-Weaver's models to the common approach used by the <b>negotiators.</b> This revised model suggests that the <b>negotiators</b> pay attention to the dynamics of the interactions presented between the two parties: the <b>negotiators</b> themselves and hostage takers. The revised model also recommends that the <b>negotiators</b> focus on not only the hostage takers behavioral characteristics, psychological conditions, and criminal history but also on the meaning of the sent message and the interaction itself as performed between the two parties. This perspective enables the <b>negotiators</b> to look at the negotiation process as information and communication process. We are not ignoring the fact that hostage negotiation is a format of extreme information management. By looking at such an extreme case, we can add to our understanding of Dervin's and Shannon-Weaver's perspectives in order to see the hostage negotiation process from a wider perspective. The revised model is not an alternative approach to the common approach most <b>negotiators</b> use. Instead, the revised model uses the perspective and directives of the common approach and extends its meaning and content by also focusing on Dervin's sense making theory and Shannon-Weaver's communication model perspectives. The use of the perspective of this revised model is one more tool for the <b>negotiators</b> to use in order to promote new ways of looking at hostage negotiation resolutions...|$|R
