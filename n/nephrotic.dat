5|$|In adults, kidney {{involvement}} progresses to end-stage {{renal disease}} (ESRD) more often than in children. In a UK series of 37 patients, 10 (27%) developed advanced kidney disease. Proteinuria, hypertension at presentation, and pathology features (crescentic changes, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy) predicted progression. About 20% of children that exhibit <b>nephrotic</b> or nephritic features experience long permanent renal impairment.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nephrotic</b> syndrome, {{in which}} protein from the {{bloodstream}} is {{released into the}} urine due to kidney diseases, can predispose to thrombosis; this is particularly the case in more severe cases (as indicated by blood levels of albumin below 25g/l) and if the syndrome {{is caused by the}} condition membranous nephropathy. Inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) predispose to thrombosis, particularly when the disease is active. Various mechanisms have been proposed.|$|E
5|$|Of the 40% of {{patients}} who develop kidney involvement, almost all have evidence (visible or on urinalysis) {{of blood in the}} urine. More than half also have proteinuria (protein in the urine), which in one eighth is severe enough to cause <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome (generalised swelling due to low protein content of the blood). While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic kidney disease. Hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur. Protein loss and high blood pressure, as well as the features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression to advanced kidney disease. Adults are more likely than children to develop advanced kidney disease.|$|E
25|$|In <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome, the {{glomerulus}} {{has been}} damaged {{so that a}} large amount of protein in the blood enters the urine. Other frequent features of the <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome include swelling, low serum albumin, and high cholesterol.|$|E
25|$|Alport's {{syndrome}} {{is associated with}} RP and an abnormal glomerular-basement membrane leading <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome and inherited as X-linked dominant.|$|E
25|$|In chronic kidney {{diseases}} with hypoalbuminemia, {{it is used}} {{along with}} albumin to increase diuresis. It is also used along with albumin in <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome to reduce edema.|$|E
25|$|Elevations of serum {{creatinine}} {{and more}} serious renal damage such as acute renal failure, chronic nephritis and <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome, are also possible. These conditions also often begin with edema and hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} other {{conditions}} can also increase cholesterol levels including diabetes mellitus type 2, obesity, alcohol use, monoclonal gammopathy, dialysis, <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome, hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome, anorexia nervosa, medications (e.g., thiazide diuretics, ciclosporin, glucocorticoids, beta blockers, retinoic acid, antipsychotics).|$|E
25|$|Metolazone {{may also}} be used in renal (kidney) disease, such as chronic renal failure or the <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome. Chronic renal failure causes excess fluid {{retention}} that is often treated with diet adjustments and diuretics. Metolazone may be combined with other diuretics (typically loop diuretics) to treat diuretic resistance in CHF, chronic renal failure, and <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome. Metolazone and a loop diuretic will synergistically enhance diuresis {{over the use of}} either agent alone. Using this combination, diuretic effects will occur at two different segments of the nephron; namely, the loop diuretic will act at the loop of Henle, and metolazone will act at the distal convoluted tubule. Metolazone is frequently prescribed in addition to the loop diuretic. Metolazone may be used for edema caused by liver cirrhosis as well.|$|E
25|$|Ciclosporin, also spelled {{cyclosporine}} and cyclosporin, is an immunosuppressant {{medication and}} natural product. It {{is used by}} mouth and injection into a vein for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome, and in organ transplants to prevent rejection. It is also used as eye drops for keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes).|$|E
25|$|To {{reduce the}} {{potential}} for cardiovascular issues, {{high blood pressure and}} high cholesterol should be prevented or treated aggressively. Steroids should be used at the lowest dose for the shortest possible period, and other drugs that can reduce symptoms should be used whenever possible. High serum creatinine, hypertension, <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome, anemia and low blood albumin are poor prognostic factors.|$|E
25|$|Glomerulonephritis* is the {{presence}} of immune complexes in the glomerulus, resulting in leakage of protein into the urine. It can be caused by cancer, heartworm disease, pyometra, rickettsial infection, or systemic lupus erythematosus. It can result in chronic kidney failure, hypoalbuminemia, which can cause ascites and peripheral edema, and <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome, which can cause hypertension or hypercoagulability.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone is used {{primarily}} to treat heart failure, edematous {{conditions such as}} <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome or ascites in people with liver disease, essential hypertension, hypokalemia, secondary hyperaldosteronism (such as occurs with hepatic cirrhosis), and Conn's syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism). On its own, spironolactone is only a weak diuretic because it primarily targets the distal nephron (collecting tubule), where only small amounts of sodium are reabsorbed, {{but it can be}} combined with other diuretics to increase efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Kidney {{involvement}} {{leads to}} the symptoms of renal failure, which are non-specific but usually cause nausea, reduced appetite (anorexia), raised blood pressure (hypertension), and occasionally the various symptoms of electrolyte disturbance such as an irregular heartbeat. Some patients report hematuria (bloody urine) but this may only be detectable on microscopic examination of the urine. Increased amounts of protein in the urine may cause edema (swelling) of the skin (a combination of symptoms known as <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome).|$|E
25|$|One-third of {{patients}} have their tumors discovered {{because they have}} an associated autoimmune disorder. As mentioned earlier, {{the most common of}} those conditions is myasthenia gravis (MG); 10–15% {{of patients}} with MG have a thymoma and, conversely, 30–45% of patients with thymomas have MG. Additional associated autoimmune conditions include thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity, pure red cell aplasia and Good syndrome (thymoma with combined immunodeficiency and hypogammaglobulinemia). Other reported disease associations are with acute pericarditis, agranulocytosis, alopecia areata, ulcerative colitis, Cushing's disease, hemolytic anemia, limbic encephalopathy, myocarditis, <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome, panhypopituitarism, pernicious anemia, polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, sensorimotor radiculopathy, stiff person syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and thyroiditis.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1995, Lomu was {{diagnosed}} with <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome, a serious kidney disorder. His rugby union career went on hold whilst the disorder was treated. In May 2003, the NZRFU announced that Lomu had been put on dialysis {{three times a week}} due to deterioration in his kidney function. Side effects of Lomu's dialysis treatment led to severe nerve damage in his feet and legs; his doctors warned him that he faced life in a wheelchair if a kidney transplant was not performed soon. At the end of July 2004 it was reported that Lomu had indeed undergone a kidney transplant on Tuesday, 28 July, in Auckland, New Zealand. The kidney was donated by Wellington radio presenter Grant Kereama.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the 1988 season, the Seahawks offered Easley {{to several}} clubs {{in an attempt}} to get a quarterback in return. [...] Easley's declining play, which was {{partially}} blamed on his work during the strike and the blossoming of Easley's backup Paul Moyer, had made Easley expendable. On April 22, 1988, the Seahawks traded Easley to the Phoenix Cardinals for quarterback Kelly Stouffer. During the mandatory team physical, Easley was diagnosed with idiopathic <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome, a severe kidney disease that voided the trade. Easley had told Moyer that he thought his days with the Seahawks were numbered because of his involvement in the player's strike. He was not surprised when the trade happened but the kidney diagnosis had [...] "shocked" [...] him. [...] The Seahawks offered several draft picks as compensation to the Cardinals to complete the trade and Easley announced his retirement a few months later.|$|E

2500|$|Renal {{physiology}} is {{the study}} of kidney function. Nephrology is the medical specialty which addresses diseases of kidney function: [...] these include chronic kidney disease, nephritic and <b>nephrotic</b> syndromes, acute kidney injury, and pyelonephritis. Urology addresses diseases of kidney (and urinary tract) anatomy: these include cancer, [...] renal cysts, kidney stones and ureteral stones, and urinary tract obstruction.|$|E
2500|$|Furosemide is {{primarily}} used [...] {{for the treatment}} of hypertension and edema. It is the first-line agent in most people with edema caused by congestive heart failure. [...] It is also used for liver cirrhosis, kidney impairment, <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome, in adjunct therapy for swelling of the brain or lungs where rapid diuresis is required (IV injection), and in the management of severe hypercalcemia in combination with adequate rehydration.|$|E
2500|$|Lomu was {{diagnosed}} with <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome, a serious kidney disorder in 1995, and the disease {{had a significant impact}} on his playing career and wider life. By 2003 he was on dialysis and in 2004 underwent a kidney transplant. He then attempted a comeback but did not play international rugby again, and retired from professional rugby in 2007. He died unexpectedly on 18 November 2015 after suffering a heart attack associated with his kidney condition.|$|E
2500|$|Acquired {{antithrombin}} deficiency {{occurs as}} a result of three distinctly different mechanisms. [...] The first mechanism is increased excretion which may occur with renal failure associated with proteinuria <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome. [...] The second mechanism results from decreased production as seen in liver failure or cirrhosis or an immature liver secondary to premature birth. [...] The third mechanism results from accelerated consumption which is most pronounced as consequence of severe injury trauma but also may be seen on a lesser scale {{as a result}} of interventions such as major surgery or cardiopulmonary bypass.|$|E

He also appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine in November, 1956. [...] "Danny" [...] was born September 11, 1953 and owned by John E. Sanders, Assistant Professor of Geology, after an earlier custody by physical education instructor, Alfred E. Scholz and Varsity Crew Coach Jim Rothschmidt. He made his mascot debut at the age of six weeks and an autopsy at his death revealed that he succumbed to acute <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|A {{subset of}} IgA {{nephropathy}} patients, who have minimal change disease on light microscopy and clinically have <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome, show an exquisite response to steroids, behaving {{more or less}} like minimal change disease. In other patients, the evidence for steroids is not compelling. [...] Short courses of high dose steroids have been proven to lack benefit. [...] However, in patients with preserved renal function and proteinuria (1-3.5 g/day), a recent prospective study has shown that 6 months regimen of steroids may lessen proteinuria and preserve renal function. However, the risks of long-term steroid use have to be weighed in such cases. [...] It {{should be noted that}} the study had 10 years of patient follow-up data, and did show a benefit for steroid therapy; there was a lower chance of reaching end-stage renal disease (renal function so poor that dialysis was required) in the steroid group. [...] Importantly, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were used in both groups equally.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nephrotic</b> {{syndrome}} {{has many}} causes and may either {{be the result}} of a glomerular disease that can be either limited to the kidney, called primary <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome (primary glomerulonephrosis), or a condition that affects the kidney {{and other parts of the}} body, called secondary <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome.|$|E
50|$|The {{incidence}} of RVT {{in people with}} <b>Nephrotic</b> syndrome ranges from 5% to 65%. <b>Nephrotic</b> syndrome is caused by Membranous Glomerulonephritis, minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.|$|E
5000|$|The alpha-1-glycoprotein is {{upregulated}} 11-fold in {{the urine}} of patients who have steroid resistant <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome. [...] A1BG was present in 7/19 patients with SRNS and was absent from all patients with steroid sensitive <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome. [...] The 13.8 kDa A1BG fragment had a high discriminatory power for steroid resistance in pediatric <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome, but is only present in a subset of patients.|$|E
50|$|Amyloid {{deposition}} in the kidneys can cause <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome, which {{results from a}} reduction in the kidney's ability to filter and hold on to proteins. The <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome occurs with or without elevations in creatinine and blood urea concentration, two biochemical markers of kidney injury. In AA amyloidosis, the kidneys are involved in 91-96% of people, symptoms ranging from protein in the urine to <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome and rarely renal insufficiency.|$|E
50|$|In <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome, the {{glomerulus}} {{has been}} damaged {{so that a}} large amount of protein in the blood enters the urine. Other frequent features of the <b>nephrotic</b> syndrome include swelling, low serum albumin, and high cholesterol.|$|E
