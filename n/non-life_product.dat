In this respect, we consider the competition in the market to model the probability of accepting an offer for a specific customer. We study two optimisation problems relevant for the insurer and present some algorithmic solutions for both continuous and discrete case. Finally, we provide some applications to a motor insurance dataset...|$|E

40|$|Insurance {{sector in}} India was privatised to {{publicise}} insurance products. After privatisation of this industry in India {{in the year}} 2000, the next important step taken in the general insurance industry was the removal of tariffs on the <b>non-life</b> insurance <b>products</b> with effect from January 1, 2007. The introduction of the free price regime has provided an impetus to the non-life sector. Before the introduction of de-tariffication almost 70 % {{of the business of}} the non-life sector was driven by various tariffs prescribed by the Tariff Advisory Committee (TAC). The TAC was established under the Insurance Act, 1938, to control and regulate the rates, terms, conditions of general insurance business. TAC has been playing a significant role to specify the tariffs for the product offered by the various insurers in India. Withdrawal of the administered price mechanism from January 1, 2007 has led insurers to design new and innovative suitable products to sustain in the competitive market. The public sector insurance companies enjoyed the monopoly status as a result they lacked flexibility and were not much concerned with profitability. This resulted in erosion of underwriting skills and income of the public sector insurance companies So, the present study is an attempt to examine the growth and performance of the public sector insurance companies operating in India in the competitive scenari...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{studies in}} the past have come to the result that {{insurance}} is a luxury good. Often it is those that have wealth to protect that can afford to protect their property. This leads to the assumption that one can differentiate between a 'rich' country and a 'developing' country by the amount of insurance penetration in the industry. Using national wealth statistics, this research undertakes a multiple regression analysis to assess the relationship between non-life insurance penetration and national wealth. The reason for this choice of variable as opposed to income, is that individuals seek to protect ~ their assets thus mitigating the risk of loss or damage of these assets. This means that in order to purchase insurance, there needs to be the presence of wealth that needs protecting. The sample comprises of 45 countries at different stages of economic growth therefore, enabling a distinction to be made between developed and developing nations. The overall result of the study found that national wealth, government consumption and wealth distribution affect demand for <b>non-life</b> insurance <b>products.</b> It was seen that an increase in wealth resulted in an increase in non-life insurance penetration, but at a decreasing rate, therefore showing a wealth elasticity of demand that is less than unity. Government consumption on the other hand, has a negative impact on non-life insurance demand, hence assuming that it is as insurance substitute. For wealth distribution, the result was that there is a positive relationship between wealth inequality and non-life insurance penetration.

40|$|Insurance {{is defined}} as an {{economic}} device to reduce or eliminate risks, by transferring the risks from individuals to insurance companies. The development of the insurance market {{is important for the}} economy through protecting assets, capital mobilisation and promoting trade. Knowledge of consumer behavior in the insurance market is important in understanding customer needs and wants. Demand for insurance is driven by many factors across the world, chief among them demographic, social, cultural and institutional factors. While several studies have been conducted to explain demand for life insurance, very little has been done for non-life insurance. Nevertheless, most of the studies to date have been concentrated in developed countries. This research investigates the demand for non-life insurance in Harare, the latter being a developing country set up. The aim of the study is to examine the determinants of demand for non-life insurance. To achieve this, a cross-sectional survey was conducted on 120 respondents drawn from buyers of <b>non-life</b> insurance <b>products</b> from six insurance companies in Harare. The data were collected through questionnaires and analysed using descriptive statistics, ANOVA and Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient and t-tests using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The major findings of the study indicate that income, age, education and legal compulsion variables are positively related to demand for non-life insurance. Income was found to be the strongest predictor of the demand for non-life insurance. There is no evidence from the survey on the positive influence of personal and cultural variables. The findings have important implications on policy formulation for both the regulatory authorities and insurance companies, particularly in influencing marketing strategies. â€...|$|R
40|$|Property and {{casualty}} actuaries are professional {{experts in}} the economic assessment of uncertain events related to <b>non-life</b> insurance <b>products</b> (e. g. fire, liability or motor insurance). For {{the construction of a}} fair and reasonable tariff associated with the risks in their portfolio, actuaries have many statistical techniques in their toolbox. In this paper tools for the pricing of multivariate risks are considered. Examples of situations where this problem occurs are numerous; e. g. workers’ compensation schemes where the insurer has information on accidents occurring ‘at work’ as well as ‘not at work’, policyholders having policies in multiple lines of business (e. g. flood, theft etc.) at the same company, or policyholders holding multiple contracts e. g. in a motor insurance context. The latter is the situation we will explore in this paper, using a data set from a European insurance company. The combination of a priori rating (through risk classification based on a priori measurable characteristics) and a posteriori rating is considered. A posteriori the claim experience of a policyholder is taken into account. In a multivariate context the pricing actuary should be able to use claim history from all business lines or risk components a policyholder is holding within the company. Intuitively, the number of claims a policyholder has reported on a particular business line or risk component reveals his general risk proneness and is as such relevant when pricing other lines or components. In contrast to the analytical approaches developed for multivariate experience rating in the literature, our approach is data-driven using Bayesian statistics. Empirical evidence has been found of positive dependence between different contracts belonging to the same policy holder, which is an intuitively appealing result. Focus is on applications of the multivariate Bayesian experience rating, as well as on graphical representations of the results...|$|R
40|$|Standard actuarial {{approaches}} for <b>non-life</b> insurance <b>products</b> {{suggest that the}} premium {{is divided into three}} main components: the actuarial price, the safety loading, and the loading for expenses. The number of product-specific policies from different companies has increased significantly, and strong market competition has boosted the demand for a competitive premium in global insurance market. Thus, the actuarial premium could eventually be altered by an insurer's marketing and management department regarding the competitive environment. Thus in this thesis, considering the competition in insurance market, game theoretical approaches are applied to investigate the influence of competition on general insurance pricing. Firstly, a two-period deterministic N-player game is formulated to investigate the optimal pricing strategy by calculating the Nash equilibrium in an insurance market. Under that framework, each insurer is assumed to maximise its utility of wealth over the unit time interval. By analyzing the competition between each pair of insurers, the whole markets' competition is characterized through an aggregation. With the purpose of solving a game of N-players, the best-response potential game with non-linear aggregation is implemented. The existence of a Nash equilibrium is proved by finding a potential function of all insurers' payoff functions. A 12 -player insurance game illustrates the theoretical findings under the framework in which the best-response selection premium strategies always provide the global maximum value of the corresponding payoff function. Secondly, deterministic differential games are constructed with the purpose of studying the insurers' equilibrium premium in a competitive market. We apply an optimal control theory to determine the open-loop Nash equilibrium premium strategies. In this direction, two models are formulated and studied. The market power of each insurance company is characterized by a price sensitive parameter, and the business volume is affected by the solvency ratio. Considering the average market premiums, the first model studies an exponential relation between premium strategies and volume of business. The other model initially characterizes the competition between any selected pair of insurers, then aggregates all the paired competitions in the market. Numerical examples illustrate the premium dynamics, and show that premium cycles may exist in equilibrium. Thirdly, a multi-stage stochastic game will be constructed. Insurers are considered to be risk-averse, that is, insurers will to set risk-premiums on their products with the purpose of avoiding risk. Mean-variance Utility function will be adopted. The expenditures of insurance companies will be discussed separately as exposure related costs and non-exposure related costs. The expenditures of insurance companies will be discussed separately as exposure related costs and non-exposure-based costs. The exposure-based component is assumed to be stochastic.

40|$|A medium size Dutch {{insurance}} company with third-party car insurance products initiated questions {{on whether the}} premium can {{be based on a}} statistical analysis where the expected future liabilities are taken into account. These questions are as follows: • Which statistical models can be used to base the premiums on expected future liabilities? • Are there enough data available to predict future liabilities accurately enough? • How can the ’best’ model be chosen? • How can the models be implemented? • What are the results when using these models for the third-party car products? After a practical introduction about insurances in society, the thesis starts with theory {{that can be used to}} answer the research questions. This analysis showed that generalized linear models are very useful models for the pricing of <b>non-life</b> insurance <b>products.</b> However, there are some disadvantages to these models which could be avoided by other models, such as hierarchical generalized linear models. We will explore several methods to determine if enough data is available to obtain credible enough estimates. One of these methods can be applied before implementing a generalized linear model. Choosing the ’best’ model is a non-trivial subject. Several statistical tests to choose which risk factors should be included in the model and how they should be included are discussed. These include tests for adding risk factors as random or fixed effects, but also which definition of an risk factor should best be used. This includes whether they should be added as a variate, as a factor or added dynamically. In addition, several statistical methods to choose the distribution that has the ’best’ fit for the observations for both the number of claims and the losses are discussed. These include graphical comparison methods, but also hypothesis testing. To answer the question how the models can be implemented, we will use the statistical programming language R. Algorithms that are used by some packages to calculate the estimates of the models are discussed, as well as several features of these algorithms. Codes are provided in the supplementary section of the thesis. Next, a statistical analysis is performed for the third-party car products of the {{insurance company}}. The performed theoretical analysis is applied in practice on the available data, and unknowns were calculated. Then an analysis is performed to determine which distribution ‘best’ fits the number of claims and which distribution ‘best’ fits the losses. The data was subdivided into several risk factors, such as age and region, and was analyzed again. A generalized linear model with a Poisson and log-link assumption was implemented for the number of claims, and a generalized linear model with a Gamma and log-link assumption was implemented for the losses. How and if the risk factors should be added was evaluated using a bottom-up approach. Initially, the models were applied without allowing interaction between risk factors, and subsequently the models were applied again, this time allowing interaction between risk factors to determine if this improved the models. Other models that may lead to a better fit for the data are also implemented. These include generalized linear mixed models, which do not assume that the observations are independent and assume a Normal distribution for the risk factors that are added as random effects. Also, a pure premium model in which the Tweedie family is used was applied. The study showed that the preferred models to calculate the pure premium are a generalized linear model with Negative Binomial and log-link assumption for the number of claims and a generalized linear model with Gamma and log-link assumption for the losses. Due to overdispersion of the observations for the number of claims, the Negative Binomial proved to be a better choice of distribution leading to a better fit of the model for the number of claims. The Normal and Pareto distribution were too symmetric and too right-skewed for the observations, respectively. The pure premium model showed a worse fit, when compared to the model for the number of claims. Furthermore, the effect of the risk factors on the risk profile of a risk group were very clear when a two-stage regression approach was used. The hierarchical models were not better models, because the estimates were less accurate. The results for the different models were then compared with the currently used pricing system of the company and the expected outcomes of the data analysis. This leads to recommendations for the insurance company, including recommendations for pricing in general but also specific recommendations for the pricing system of the third-party insurance product. The full thesis contains confidential information, therefore, a public version was provided in which the insurance company is anonymous.
