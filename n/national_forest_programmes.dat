Beside all the controversial interpretations and vague descriptions of <b>national</b> <b>forest</b> <b>programmes</b> (NFPs), there seems also to be a notably widespread agreement on certain characteristics of NFPs: the first widely agreed characteristic is the procedural nature of NFPs, the second relates to the focus on policy planning. Nonetheless, two major different viewpoints can be said to exist regarding the results of such policy planning efforts: in the first line of thinking the provision of a policy plan and its implementation stands central; in the second line of thinking the establishment of the planning process itself stands central. It is argued that these differences can be deducted according to different assumed rationalities about the implementation process, namely that of an instrumental rationality and that of a communicative rationality. A cross-comparative system reveals that the instrumental rationality is predominant in the approaches to NFPs in Europe.

40|$|Since the UNCED in 1992 and as {{a result}} of {{subsequent}} meetings within the global forest dialogue, the paradigm of sustainable management, conservation and sustainable development of forests (SFM) has been introduced and promoted as a new long-term policy commitment in the Global Environmental Policy. In the wake of major efforts of policy-making at various levels worldwide, <b>National</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Programmes</b> (NFPs) have been suggested as an appropriate participatory planning instrument to translate and safeguard the SFM at national and sub-national level by highlighting social and ecological priorities. Furthermore, NFPs are seen as means to improve the convergence of short-term political choices and long-term orientation of policy measures, and to coordinate the policy actors through democratic action principles such as participation, decentralisation, holistic and cross-sectoral orientation. Thus, the NFPs are deemed to be promising new participatory governance instruments with potential to contribute to substantial change in the existing policies relevant to natural resource management. Despite the plenty of theoretical and empirical findings on NFPs in European context, little knowledge exists to date, however, whether a substantial NFP is a sufficient for substantial o...|$|E

The decision-making processes concerning NFPs involve almost of the parties affected by forestry issues. Furthermore, the results show some strengths and weaknesses that are observable in all European participatory processes referring to NFPs. On the one hand, the participatory processes are important because they are the opportunities to involve stakeholders in cross sector processes that review forestry problems and policies. On the other hand, the participatory processes are time, cost, and effort consuming, non-representative, and participants usually have not enough skills and resources.

40|$|The Swedish forest {{policies}} have earlier mainly {{been focused on}} two goals: production and environment. The production goal aims to benefit the economical gains from forestry while the environmental goal primarily aims to shield the ecological values of the forest.

Sustainable development includes supporting economic, ecologic as well as social values of which the latter seems to have been forgotten in the forestry sector. This was recently brought to attention to the sector and the debate how to handle the social values is now ongoing. The legislator has not been unaware of the social values since they have since long been at least somewhat included in the preliminary works. With the impending introduction of a Swedish <b>national</b> <b>forest</b> <b>programme</b> the platform to integrate the social values of the forest into Swedish forestry seems to appear.

40|$|Background and Purpose: National forest {{programs}} have been promoted by the international forest policy sphere as a preferred form of policy {{process by which the}} sustainable forest management should be reached on national level. As such, it has received a lot of attention in the international legislation and has been important part of the forest policy dialogue. This paper examines the national forest programs from the side of its theoretical development, and how it has been transposed from the international sphere onto the national domains. Material and Methods: Paper examines international legislation refereeing to the national forest programs, and provides an overview of its development. Comparative analysis of national forest program processes in Europe has been made, along with presentation of different national approaches to it. Topic-related scientific literature has been analyzed, with special emphasis on its procedural elements. Results and Conclusion: International legislation shows great coherence regarding the development of the concept of national forest programs. The same coherence is present in the scientific community, but not among the forest policy practitioners, which is reflected by a great variety of developments of national forest programs across Europe. This variety is not as important as are the procedural aspects of the process, which promote mode of governance in line with the new general paradigm of forest planning.

40|$|Considerable {{efforts have}} been made to enhance {{conservation}} of forest genetic resources and to promote sustainable forest management in Europe over the past decade. The need to enhance genetic conservation emerged from a concern about the impacts of environmental pollution and genetic erosion on forest ecosystems in the late 1980 s. The concept of sustainable forest management, in a roader sense, gained ground in Europe after the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992 paid special attention to the role of forest ecosystems in maintaining and conserving biological diversity. Several Ministerial Conferences on the Protection of Forests in Europe were organised in the 1990 s and this was a major political process pushing forward improvements in these two areas. In 1994, the European Forest Genetic Resources Programme was set up as an implementation mechanism of the Strasbourg Resolution (1990) on the conservation of forest genetic resources. In the same year, Pan-European Criteria and Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management were also adopted following the Helsinki Resolution (1993) on sustainable forest management. In many European countries, however, more resources have been channelled into habitat and species conservation while fewer resources have been allocated to the development of national programmes on forest genetic resources. Less than 30 % of European countries have such programmes, which are necessary for implementing gene conservation in practical forestry. Subsequently, these programmes should be better linked with the overall <b>national</b> <b>forest</b> <b>programmes,</b> which are developing policies for the whole forest sector and also allocating resources for implementing sustainable forest management. The pan-European criteria and indicators include genetic indicators in rather operational ways, but {{there is a need to}} improve monitoring of genetic sustainability by developing commonly agreed technical terminology.

40|$|The aims of {{the study}} are to conduct {{comparative}} analyses of the forest policies and their provisions supporting the use of forest resources in bioenergy generation, {{to look into the}} governments energy policies and their provisions supporting the use of renewable energy, to analyse the market for energy wood and the barriers hindering its use for energy generation in two selected countries. Finland and Slovakia were chosen for the analysis. The {{aims of the}} study also include outlining the specific policy tools and the marketing tools with their activities, which could improve the conditions in the energy wood market. The comparative case study also includes analyses of the barriers and a SWOT analysis of the energy wood market. The results of the study point out the high indicative targets set by the European Commission for the share of renewable energy sources in the total energy consumption in the studied countries. On the other hand, the <b>National</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Programmes</b> and the national energy policies in both countries include a number of indicative priorities supporting the utilization of forest biomass. Both countries have adopted several legislative, financial, and other measures supporting the use of biomass for energy generation. Nevertheless, they differ substantially in regard to the level of use of forest-based resources as renewable energy sources. The current share of renewable energy sources in the total energy consumption of Finland is 28 %, while in Slovakia it is less than 7 %. The results of the SWOT analyses based on the outcomes of several national and international projects point especially to the threat of the global financial crisis and global warming.

One such exception is the city of Celje, which partially meets the objectives set, owing to the fourteen kilometer well-maintained trails through the so-called City Forest, i. e. the urban forest {{in the context of}} the Learning Route in the tourist region of Celjska Koča. In this paper, we tackled an example of good practice, launched this year (2014) and conducted by the LTO Laufar Cerkno. The idea to do marketing of anti-stress therapies in the Slovenian forests is quite appropriate, since almost 60 % of Slovenia is covered by forests. Based on the beneficial effects of certain forest types, there are at least three of them, suitable for implementing the so-called Forest Selfness Therapies owing to the great spread and representation of tree species since they, along with the therapeutic effects, promote strategic sustainable development, based on the development strategy of Slovenia tourism, as stated in Slovenian Tourism Development Strategy 2012 - 2016. Given the fact that over the last decade, we have had highly positive trends, both in the growing number of tourists and overnights as well as in tourism receipts, it is logical to define a marketing concept for exploiting the social functions of the forest which are presented in this paper. The latter covers the definition of anti-stress therapies, service positioning in the market, exemplifying individual selfness products, segmentation of target customers as well as implementation of an effective marketing mix. Forest exploitation in Slovenia in terms of marketing the anti-stress therapies is definitely a niche market where Slovenia can significantly increase tourism receipts in the context of sustainable development...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} summarises {{the outcome}} of a regional training workshop, "Interactive and dynamic approaches on forest and land use planning in Southern Africa". It was organised in December 2001 by the government of Botswana in cooperation with organisations in Zimbabwe and South Africa and with Swedish financial and technical support. The workshop aimed at exposing the participants to new cross sector approaches on strategic forest and land use planning, including the Area Production Model (APM) and concept, and to provide a platform for possible future development work in this field. It concerned such issues as the role of planning in relation to policies and local development, information and data needs in planning, the use of scenario modelling in land use planning, how to narrow the gap between "planning from above" and "planning from below", and the roles and interaction of different stakeholders in the planning process. The workshop had been proposed by the participating countries following an international training programme on policy and strategy development in Sweden. The 18 participants from three countries included central and local government staff concerned with forest and land use planning at the national and sub-national level, researchers and NGOs. The workshop consisted of two weeks of lectures, seminars and field based case studies and a concluding seminar, in which the participants presented their experiences and conclusions about the APM concept to a broader group of decision makers. Some of the main conclusions drawn by the participants were that the APM was a useful tool for promoting dynamic and multi-sector planning. At the same time the Model has a number of technical shortcomings that needs to be addressed. Those shortcomings were identified and discussed throughout the workshop. The need to keep the model simple and transparent was acknowledged. It was proposed that "homes" should be identified for the model in each country. Those homes should build up and maintain capacity to develop and adapt the model to the local conditions and priorities. INTRODUCTION. The workshop "Interactive and dynamic approaches on forest and land-use planning in Southern Africa" was arranged in Botswana in December 2001. It aimed at exposing the participants to new cross sector approaches on strategic forest and land use planning, including the Area Production Model (APM), and to provide a platform for possible future development work in this field. The workshop was the concluding step of a process that had been running for several years. It provides important lessons on approaches to cross-sectoral land use planning in Southern Africa. The process started in 1998, when there were several participants from Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe in an annual international course "Development of National Forest Policies and Strategies", organised by the Swedish National Board of Forestry and funded by Sida. Those participants strongly suggested that the Area Production Model, (APM), which had been demonstrated during the course, might be highly relevant in Southern Africa. As a response, the Country Capacity Building (CCB) project (a Sida funded project aiming at forest policy issues), set up a training programme in discussions with the three countries. As a first step, key personnel from the forest authorities in Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe, underwent a post­ graduate course at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) in Umea, Sweden. The course took place in March 2000 and was focused on the ideas and applications of the APM. In a second step, a workshop designated for a wider audience, including governmental as well as non­ governmental organisations, was planned for mid 2000. The workshop was originally intended to be a two-phase arrangement. The first phase to be arranged in Zimbabwe, focusing on model theory with only limited field work, and a second phase, were the participants would split up and work a realistic case in a designated study area {{in each of the three}} countries involved. Unfortunately, the political situation in Zimbabwe during spring 2000 made it necessary to postpone the workshop. About a year later, in spring 2001, it was agreed among the interested countries to move it to another country in the Region, after the Ministry of Agriculture, Botswana, had generously accepted to host the workshop. The two-phase design of the workshop was by now reduced to a single event, with the joint study-area around Serowe in the eastern part of Botswana. The APM is a simulation model developed by Professor Nils-Erik Nilsson in co-operation with FAO. The Model, including an application concept, has been further developed by the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), Department of Forest Resource Management and Geomatics. The Swedish team of resource persons in the Botswana workshop have all been instrumental in the previous development work of the Model. The APM has been field tested on numerous occasions in South and Southeast Asia. This workshop, however, is the first occasion the model is used in Southern Africa. In spite of the simplicity and flexibility that characterises the model, the new setting was considered a major challenge when planning the workshop. The workshop results have given new and partly unexpected results in terms of both usefulness and applicability of the model. The Country Capacity Building project focuses on forest policy development. In modem terminology, nfp (<b>national</b> <b>forest</b> <b>programmes)</b> is a highly relevant term. Key strategies include support to demand driven processes, investment in human knowledge and, not least, a belief that personal commitment is as important for success as political commitments. On behalf of the organisers, I would like to thank the Ministry of Agriculture, Botswana, and the key­ persons from Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Without their commitment and enthusiasm, the positive outcome of the workshop would not have been possible...|$|E

Afforestation <b>programmes</b> financed by the European Union and the existing protection laws for the species {{are one of the}} main reasons for this increase. These efforts are important to promote for these stands a distribution by age class that ensure cork oak forest sustainability (only 14 % of the existing even-aged stands are young stands with less than 10 years). In this study, the programme – Afforestation of Agricultural Land – in the region of Beira Interior Sul was analysed, to assess afforestation success during the period of 2001 to 2011...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the current status}} of forest management tools and their pplication at different levels in Italy where the majority of land planning has been and is still being done at the “micro-scale”, meaning that specific local issues are dealt with locally. Starting from international European Union law, the authors review the forest acts that led from the <b>National</b> <b>Forest</b> Plan (NFP) to smaller scales, in relation to their geographic and territorial applicability. Scaling down from the NFP to the local level the various Italian <b>forest</b> <b>programmes</b> and plans are analysed according to a vertical logic (hierarchical mode) : Regional <b>Forest</b> <b>Programme</b> (RFP), Territorial (i. e. sub-regional) Forest Plan (TFP), Local Forest Plans (LFPs). Then, in a horizontal logic, it is highlighted the importance of an intersectorial and harmonic relational frame among planning tools for the forest and other sectors of environmental planning. As a result of these analyses, the authors emphasize the need for a new systematic holistic approach to the management of forests and environmental resources in general, and in line with all the most important processes at international level on this matter...|$|R

40|$|The {{search for}} {{effective}} strategies to protect forests and improve livelihoods {{of the people}} dependent on them has led to several participatory approaches to governance {{over the past few}} decades globally. However, an important factor that hinders effective governance in most situations is the prevalence of complex interplay of power and knowledge among diverse groups of actors with unequal access to deliberative interactions related to governance. This means that improving governance must meet the challenges of modifying deep rooted, complex patterns of power that affect deliberative processes. Drawing on the concepts of deliberation (following Habermas) and symbolic violence (following Bourdieu), this paper explores the possibility and challenges of deliberative governance, taking the case of community forestry in Nepal. The central question this study seeks to address is how and to what extent various actors engage (or do not engage) in deliberative processes while enacting governance practices. It shows how a <b>national</b> <b>forest</b> governance <b>programme</b> is enacted as a complex economy of practices by a wide array of participants and analyses how certain groups continue to dominate the decision-making practices despite the growing rhetoric of participatory governance. Symbolic violence for our purpose occurs when claims to superior knowledge are used to legitimate closure in deliberation on forest governance practices and accepted by those excluded from effective deliberation. In the field of forest governance, we identify patterns of symbolic violence that limit the possibility of deliberation: creating boundaries in social field, cultivating internalised beliefs among governance actors, and sustaining unequal access to symbolic capital. The paper following Bourdieu, stipulates crisis as a necessary condition for the development of demands for increased deliberation by subordinated participants, and then explore sociological conditions for the development of crises into the situation of symbolic violence.
