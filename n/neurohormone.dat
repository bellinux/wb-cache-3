25|$|The glandular system {{contains}} four glands: the mandibular, maxillary, labial, and postpharyngeal glands. The postpharyngeal is {{well developed}} in the queen, while the other glands are larger in workers. The postpharyngeal gland functions as a vacuum to absorb fatty acids and triglycerides, {{as well as a}} gastric caecum. The functions of the other glands remain poorly understood. In one study discussing the enzymes of the digestion system of adult ants, lipase activity was found in the mandibular and labial glands, as well as invertase activity. The Dufour's gland found in the ant acts as a source of trail pheromones, although scientists believed the poison gland was the source of the queen pheromone. The <b>neurohormone</b> pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide is found in the ant that activates the biosynthesis of pheromones from the Dufour's gland. The spermatheca gland is found in queens, which functions in sperm maintenance. Males appear to lack these glands, but those associated with its head are morphologically similar to those found in workers, but these glands may act differently.|$|E
40|$|The <b>neurohormones</b> are {{the master}} {{regulators}} of all life processes in insects and {{they create a}} strategy of stress protecting events. <b>Neurohormones</b> are synthesized mainly in insect brain neurosecretory neurons. Various stressors of different intensity cause specific changes which influence on neurosecretory neurons activity and synthesis of <b>neurohormones</b> (biogene amines, ecdysiotropins, ecdysiostatins, allatoregulatory <b>neurohormones,</b> adipokinetic <b>neurohormones,</b> etc.). Biogene amines in insects may function as <b>neurohormones</b> controlling carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as the primary response of the insects {{to the effect of}} stressors. Intermediary metabolism in insects is mainly regulated by adipokinetic hormones which supply organism by energy especially in extreme conditions. Stress induces changes in release of ecdysioregulatory and allatoregulatory <b>neurohormones</b> and modificates ecdysones and juvenile hormones synthesis in prothoracic gland and corpora allata. The involvement of hormones of an ecdysteroid or JH type in response to stress creates the danger of an untimely induction of morphogenetic process in target cells. Limiting the quantity of secreted hormones and shortening the period when target cells are sensitive to morphogenetic stimuli removes this danger...|$|R
50|$|Neither male nor female montane voles release high {{quantities}} of oxytocin or vasopressin when they mate. Even when injected with these <b>neurohormones,</b> their mating {{system does not}} change. In contrast, if prairie voles are injected with the <b>neurohormones,</b> they may form a lifelong attachment, {{even if they have}} not mated. It's believed that the differing response to the <b>neurohormones</b> between the two species is due to a difference in the number of oxytocin and vasopressin receptors. Prairie voles have a greater number of oxytocin and vasopressin receptors compared to montane voles, and are therefore more sensitive to those two <b>neurohormones.</b> It's believed that it's the quantity of receptors, rather than the quantity of the hormones, that determines the mating system and bond-formation of either species.|$|R

25|$|DSPD {{was first}} {{formally}} described in 1981 by Elliot D. Weitzman {{and others at}} Montefiore Medical Center. It is responsible for 7–10% of patient complaints of chronic insomnia. However, since many doctors are unfamiliar with the condition, it often goes untreated or is treated inappropriately; DSPD is often misdiagnosed as primary insomnia or as a psychiatric condition. DSPD can be treated or helped in some cases by careful daily sleep practices, morning light therapy, evening dark therapy, earlier exercise and meal times, and medications such as melatonin and modafinil; the former is a natural <b>neurohormone</b> {{partly responsible for the}} human body clock. At its most severe and inflexible, DSPD is a disability. A chief difficulty of treating DSPD is in maintaining an earlier schedule after it has been established, as the patient's body has a strong tendency to reset the sleeping schedule to its intrinsic late times. People with DSPD may improve their quality of life by choosing careers that allow late sleeping times, rather than forcing themselves to follow a conventional 9-to-5 work schedule.|$|E

2500|$|Crick {{suggested}} {{that it might be}} possible to find chemical changes in the brain that were molecular correlates of the act of prayer. He speculated that there might be a detectable change in the level of some neurotransmitter or <b>neurohormone</b> when people pray. He might have been imagining substances such as dopamine that are released by the brain under certain conditions and produce rewarding sensations. Crick's suggestion that there might someday be a new science of [...] "biochemical theology" [...] seems to have been realized under an alternative name: there is now the new field of neurotheology. Crick's view of the relationship between science and religion continued to play a role in his work as he made the transition from molecular biology research into theoretical neuroscience.|$|E

5000|$|A natural neuroactive {{substance}} (NAS) is {{a chemical}} synthesized by neurons {{that affects the}} actions of other neurons or muscle cells. Natural neuroactive substances include neurotransmitters, <b>neurohormones,</b> and neuromodulators.

2500|$|Until its {{identification}} {{in plants}} in 1987, melatonin was for decades {{thought to be}} primarily an animal <b>neurohormone.</b> [...] When melatonin was identified in coffee extracts in the 1970s, it {{was believed to be}} a byproduct of the extraction process. Subsequently, however, melatonin has been found in all plants that have been investigated. It is present in all the different parts of plants, including leaves, stems, roots, fruits, and seeds in varying proportions. Melatonin concentrations differ not only among plant species, but also between varieties of the same species depending on the agronomic growing conditions, varying from picograms to several micrograms per gram. Notably high melatonin concentrations have been measured in popular beverages such as coffee, tea, wine, and beer, and crops including corn, rice, wheat, barley, and oats. Melatonin is a poor direct antioxidant, it is, however, a highly efficient direct free radical scavenger and indirect antioxidant due to its ability to stimulate antioxidant enzymes. Thus, melatonin in the human diet is believed to confer a number of beneficial health-related effects. In some common foods and beverages, including coffee and walnuts, the concentration of melatonin has been estimated or measured to be sufficiently high to raise the blood level of melatonin above daytime baseline values.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} {{is to provide a}} {{comprehensive}} examination of the current literature describing the neural-immune interactions, with emphasis on the most recent findings of the effects of <b>neurohormones</b> on immune system. Particularly, the role of hypothalamic hormones such as Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). In the past few years, interest has been raised in extrapituitary actions of these <b>neurohormones</b> due to their receptors have been found in many non-pituitary tissues. Also, the receptors are present in immune cells, suggesting an autocrine or paracrine role within the immune system. In general, these <b>neurohormones</b> have been reported to exert immunomodulatory effects on cell proliferation, immune mediators release and cell function. The implications of these findings in understanding the network of hypothalamic neuropeptides and immune system are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Neurosecretion is the storage, {{synthesis}} {{and release}} of hormones from neurons.

40|$|Urate, a naturally-occurring antioxidant, is a marker/factor for {{cardiovascular}} disease. Hyperuricaemia {{is associated}} with IR, MetS and endothelial dysfunction. We characterised the associations between <b>neurohormones,</b> uricaemia, and glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) males. Cross-sectional; 705 T 2 DM males divided into two groups: uric acid or= 7. 0 mg/dl (hyperuricaemic; n= 229). HOMA beta-cell function (B), insulin sensitivity (S), hyperbolic product (BxS), and (BxS) loss rate were determined alongside <b>neurohormones</b> (Nt-proANP, BNP, Big ET- 1 and UII). Mean age and diabetes duration were not different between groups. Hyperuricaemics had more macroangiopathy, total/central adiposity, IR, hypertension, dyslipidemia and MetS prevalence. Nt-proANP and BNP levels were {{more than twice as}} high in hyperuricaemics, whereas Big ET- 1 and UII were higher by 46 % and 14 %, respectively. HOMA (BxS) was higher in hyperuricaemics: 31 (16) % vs. 26 (18) % (p= 0. 0004). BxS loss rate was faster in normouricaemics: 1. 36 (0. 54) % vs. 1. 20 (0. 43) %/year(- 1) (p< 0. 0001). The proportion with HbA(1 C) < 7. 0 % was 39 % (normouricaemics) vs. 49 % (hyperuricaemics; p= 0. 0091).

The median eminence is rich in fenestrated capillaries, allowing for the passage of proteins and <b>neurohormones.</b> More specifically, the median eminence allows for the transport of <b>neurohormones</b> between the CSF and the peripheral blood supply. The major cell type that makes up the median eminence are specialized ependymal cells known as tanycytes. These contribute to the organ's ability to selectively allow macromolecules to pass from the central to the peripheral neuroendocrine systems.|$|R
