50|$|The {{telescope}} was next {{brought up to}} the approximate declination of the target star by watching the finder circle. The instrument was provided with a clamping apparatus, by which the observer, after having set the approximate declination, could clamp the axis so the telescope could not be moved in declination, except very slowly by a fine screw. By this slow motion, the {{telescope was}} adjusted until the star moved along the horizontal wire (or if there were two, in the middle between them), from {{the east side of}} the field of view to the west. Following this, the circles were read by the microscopes for a measurement of the apparent altitude of the star. The difference between this measurement and the nadir point was the <b>nadir</b> <b>distance</b> of the star. A movable horizontal wire or declination-micrometer was also used.|$|E
40|$|In the first, {{theoretical}} {{part of my}} diploma thesis main topic is presentation of different approaches to executing individual phases in procedure of creating true orthophotos. Firstly I explain main idea of (classical) orthophotos and its disadvatages, which caused the need of true orthophotos. I divide the whole procedure into seven steps: acquiring data for 3 D model, 3 D modelling, acquiring photographs, orto rectification, locating obscured areas, colour matching and mosaicking with feathering. In step of acquiring data for 3 D model I explain acquisition with laser scanner and with image matching in greater detail. Both methods allow quick acquisition of great amount of points and are therefore very convenient for creating digital surface model (DSM). 3 D modelling chapter amongst others introduces hybrid model, which is combination of triangular irregular network - TIN (accuracy) and grid (simple data structure). Five methods for obscured areas detection are presented: Z-buffer method, polygon based method, triangle based method, angle based method and height based method. In mosaicking phase three criteria for choosing homologous pixels (from overlaying orthophotos) are presented: distance to <b>nadir,</b> <b>distance</b> to obscured areas and angle between projetion ray and DSM. The main aim of practical part of diploma thesis {{was to create a}} true orhophoto of a simple object. I chose a section of façade of residential block with two balconies. DSM is described with five rectangules in 3 D space. I chose angle method for obscured area detection and distance to nadir criterion for mosaicking. Colour matching and feathering were not applied...|$|E
40|$|Passive millimetre-wave imaging is a {{potential}} solution to surveillance problems like clouds and other obscurants. Research has shown that passive millimetre-wave imaging can form high contrast, natural imagery even through foul weather. This arises principally because the relatively long wavelength of millimetre-waves enables penetration of foul weather and obscurants such as cloud, fog, dust and smoke. Millimetre-wave imaging is essentially thermal imaging at a long wavelength and so both day and night operation is possible. The application of passive acquisition methods, which are hard to detect by hostile forces, is important for strategical and tactical reasons and the sensors own security. In mountainous regions or in highly urbanized areas an almost Nadir looking imaging scheme for the data acquisition is beneficial {{in order to avoid}} information gaps in certain locations due to shadowing. Because of the incoherent statistical character of the natural thermal radiation, synthetic imaging principles like synthetic aperture radar (SAR) are not applicable and thus millimetre-wave radiometers are forced to use real antenna apertures leading to a poorer spatial resolution. For example consider the case of a W-band airborne reconnaissance system operating from a 5 km <b>Nadir</b> <b>distance</b> with a desired ground resolution of about 2 m. The antenna aperture would be about 7 m, which would be completely impractical for a conventional antenna. For this situation the imaging principle of aperture synthesis from radio astronomy has to be applied. Here a highly thinned array of small-aperture antennas can be used and by proper processing of the signal correlations of each antenna pair the wanted brightness temperature distribution on ground can be determined. The advanced method of aperture synthesis as a new approach for high resolution passive imaging is comprehensively discussed and simulated system design examples are illustrated. The imaging performance of aperture synthesis is investigated using measured high resolution W-band data of typical military targets as an ideal input brightness temperature distribution. From that starting point the ideal system response is computed and impacts of various system errors are shown. The feasibility of such a system on a UAV platform is discussed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} BRDF data of {{an urban}} area, assuming a pixel size of about 750 m Θ 750 m. It is derived from multispectral scanner data acquired over Nuremberg, Germany, with a small spatial resolution (pixelsize 2. 1 m Θ 2. 1 m) by averaging over several 1000 lines of scanned data. The data show a clear decrease of reflectance across <b>nadir</b> as <b>distance</b> from the retrosolar direction increases. This behaviour is created by the 3 -D surface structure {{of an urban}} scene and the associated shadow casting. INTRODUCTION The `Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function' BRDF was defined by [1] to describe the bidirectional reflectance of diffusely scattering, homogenous surfaces. Very often in remote sensing applications the surfaces are not homogenous. This {{is especially true for}} urban areas, that consist of a heterogenous mixture of houses, streets and vegetation. Furthermore the color of these components varies considerably. Measuring the BRDF of small homogenous urban surfac [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Airborne laser {{scanning}} is nowadays {{one of the}} most used technologies for data collection of the shape of the Earth´s surface. Point cloud as a result of {{laser scanning}} is often used to produce high-quality digital terrain models (DTM), whose accuracy is evaluated in the analysis process. In the thesis we discussed the influence of the geometry of laser scanning on determination of the DTM´s altitude component on two different types of grounding, meadow and asphalt, in testing area in Radovljica. Within each area we discussed two data sets, strip point clouds and georeferenced point clouds. We analyzed the impact of the height of the recording platform over the terrain, the size of angle from <b>nadir</b> and <b>distance</b> from the GNSS ground reference station on the geometry of laser scanning. The height comparison was based on check points, measured in the field. Based on the analysis {{of the quality of the}} DTM, the results of which are the measures of statistical dispersion, and the calculated geometric parameters, the figures were plotted, and those are the main way the results are displayed. Final findings regarding the size of each effect on the quality of the determination of point positions based on airborne laser scanning are given in the conclusion...|$|R
