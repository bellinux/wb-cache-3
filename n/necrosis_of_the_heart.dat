50|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI), {{or heart}} attack, {{occurs when a}} blood clot forms around a plaque already obstructing flow in coronary arteries preventing proper blood supply. Total occlusion of a coronary artery is the consequence of a plaque rupture and forming a blood clot disrupting blood flow. This leads to a risk zone with rapid loss of oxygen delivery, deprivation of nutritive flow to the heart leading to necrosis of the myocardium known as MI. Myocardial infarctions are graded according to severity: The less severe type is Non ST-segment Elevated Myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with deprivation of flow occurring only in the subendocardium. ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) is the severe type. Here the damage is transmural with a completely blocked coronary artery. Although many occluded coronary arteries spontaneously reopen before the patient is treated with PPCI (primary percutaneous catheter interventions), the consequence of the arterial occlusion is a wave of <b>necrosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> muscle within the deprived area dependent of the occlusion time of a major coronary artery Despiteand residual collateral flow. Current therapies in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) focus on the rapid reopening of the occluded coronary arteries (PPCI), but recently also the ischemic microcirculation became a therapeutic target. Coronary angioplasty (or primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI)) {{has been used as}} a way to restore blood flow following an MI to the heart in order to prevent excessive damage to the tissue. This is the result of inadequate blood flow in the coronary microvasculature in spite of reopened large epicardial coronary arteries leaving myocardium insufficiently supported. Reduced myocardial blood flow causes in addition to necrosis apoptosis of sublethally injured tissue leading to reduced heart function and the potential of heart failure. This phenomenon is part of reperfusion injury (WP-Link), the damage of myocardium after reopening of major coronary arteries, accounts for 50% of the final infarct size after STEMI. Therefore, the therapeutic target before, during or after reopening of epicardial coronary arteries is the obstructed microcirculation. This obstruction of coronary microcirculation is the main target of PICSO clearing the coronary vasculature and restore nutritive flow by inducing washout in low flow or no flow areas.|$|E

40|$|The acute {{coronary}} {{syndrome is}} {{a major cause of}} hospitalization and high mortality rates. For many there have been ongoing debates years over the treatment method choice and various diagnostic methods. The purpose of the research is to investigate the diagnostic capabilities of emergency coronary angiography and efficacy of transluminal balloon angioplasty with stenting for {{acute coronary syndrome}} with lifting and without ST elevation. Results In patients with ACS with ST-segment elevation myocardial contractility was better after thrombolytic therapy, which is appropriate over the first 2 hours of the onset of anginal pain. However, in the group of the patients with ACS with ST-segment elevation violations of local contractility was more common than in the group of patients with ACS without ST-segment elevation. In both groups of patients with ACS the risk of unfavorable outcome did not depend on the number of affected vessels, but on a variant of the syndrome (elevation or without ST elevation). In patients with ACS with ST-segment elevation was significantly more frequently identified hemodynamically significant stenosis of the arteries. In ACS without ST-segment elevation no statistically significant difference in myocardial contractility and risk of unfavorable outcome on the scale of GRACE in groups with single and biarterial coronary disease not obtained. In the case of significant stenoses diagnosed through emergency coronary angiography, emergency balloon angioplasty with stenting is indicated. When there is technical impossibility of angioplasty (excessive tortuosity, occlusion, stenosis of the left main coronary artery, etc.), it is advisable to perform emergency bypass surgery. Discussion and Conclusions The analysis of the treatment results it revealed that timely percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stenting in combination with thrombolytic therapy has contributed significantly to improving not only contractility, but also the results of endovascular interventions and reducing the risk of both in-hospital and 6 -month mortality. Therefore, only the integrated approach to the delivery of health care will reduce the incidence of <b>necrosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> muscle and improve the treatment results {{and the quality of the}} life of patients with ACS...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>The</b> {{avascular}} <b>necrosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> femoral head represents <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> bone tissue due to <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> blood supply. <b>The</b> {{disease has}} a progressive evolution and left untreated leads to femoral head collapse and severe arthritis. Case presentation: We present {{a case of}} a pertrochanteric fracture which has been successfully operated with a dynamic interlocking trochanteric gamma nail on the right hip. At 2 years after surgery the patient developed an incipient avascular <b>necrosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> femoral head. Despite <b>the</b> good positioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> implant, we considered that <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pain was an intolerance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> implant, and thus we removed it. After implant removal, the patient was kept under observation and conservative treatment, to prevent further damage to the right hip and allow the healing to occur. At 6 months after the gamma nail was removed the X-rays revealed advanced avascular <b>necrosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> femoral head and secondary osteoarthritis on the right hip. The patient underwent surgery with an uncemented total hip arthroplasty. Discussion: There are a few discussions regarding <b>the</b> avascular <b>necrosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> femoral head.
