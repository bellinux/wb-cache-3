40|$|Abstract: <b>Needle</b> <b>valve</b> {{is the key}} {{component}} of diesel engine cylinder. Changing the nozzle Orifice chamferinging will influence the flow coefficient and spray performance. Firstly, we proposed a physical model of abrasive flow field inside the <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> based on computational fluid dynamics technology. Then, we set the computing method and boundary type. Finally, we simulated the abrasive flow field using fluent software. The result is useful for guidance in the actual grinding process. Intrudction As the highest thermal efficiency power machinery, diesel engine has been widely used in transportation, engineering machinery, mining machinery and agricultural machinery, and so on. Diesel performance primarily depends {{on the merits of}} its injection system performance. <b>Needle</b> <b>valve</b> {{as one of the most}} important components in injection system, it will directly affect the performance of the injection system 0. Chamferinging on the orifice can greatly improve the flow coefficient and the flow velocity of diesel in grinding 0. But, the relationship between the size of chamferinging and the increment of orifice flow coefficient is not clear. Besides, it is difficult to measure the size of orifice chamferinging because it is inside the <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> and the diameter of <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> is small. As a result, this dissertation utilizes the software fluent to simulate and analyze the flow field in <b>needle</b> <b>valve,</b> and confirms the impact of orifice chamfering on the injection performance. It is significant to guide the actual grinding.

A <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> degrader was modified to include partial recirculation of degraded fuel and heat addition in the bypass loop. A pressure drop across the <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> {{of up to}} 4, 000 psi was used. The pressure drop across a 325 mesh filter screen placed inline with the degrader and directly downstream of the <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> was measured {{as a function of}} time for different values of pressure drop across the <b>needle</b> <b>valve.</b> A volume flux of 1 gpm/sq in was employed based on the frontal area of the screen.

At fuel temperatures below - 20 C, degradation becomes increasingly difficult and a single pass technique results in unacceptable filtration performance.

Mechatronic principles are used to bring new understanding to the field of very low flow control using <b>needle</b> <b>valves.</b> Flow rate experiments were conducted using a mechatronically controlled <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> and a novel flow measurement device constructed for the purpose, from which an analytical flow model is developed. Details of a linear actuated <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> are given along with open loop and closed loop control systems developed for the purpose of accurately controlling very low flows. The open loop system is derived from the valve operating principles enabling an efficient method of modelling the valve flow characteristics for the purpose of control.
