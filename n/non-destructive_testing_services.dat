40|$|The Small Punch (SP) test is a {{miniature}} technique {{that can provide}} information on materials performance {{for a range of}} situations where standard testing is not applicable or considered too material consuming. The SP is especially suited for determining material properties for heat affected zones in welds (local) and for nearly <b>non-destructive</b> <b>testing</b> of <b>service</b> exposed materials. Also, the SP is a powerful tool for ranking of novel materials produced in small quantities and for testing irradiated materials. The SP test is multi-axial in nature and the deformation and stress response is complex. The interpretation of SP test results is challenging and the validity of simplified transformation assumptions can be argued. In this paper SP test data generated following the SP testing Code of Practice are analysed for the determination of creep properties of P 91 steel. The results are assessed and compared to corresponding uniaxial data and public domain results. Special attention is given to test set-up details, initial specimen deformation (creep), test repeatability and post-test examination procedures. The measured data scatter is used for determining expected life time prediction accuracy in creep. JRC. F. 4 -Innovative Technologies for Nuclear Reactor Safet...|$|R

30|$|Among the <b>non-destructive</b> <b>tests</b> of wood-based materials, the {{flexural}} {{vibration method}} {{has been widely}} implemented [21 – 24]. The durability performance of <b>non-destructive</b> <b>tests</b> has not been reported. Dynamic modulus of elasticity (Ed) based on resonance frequency measured during a vibration test {{can be used to}} evaluate the bending performance of wood-based materials [25]. The advantages of <b>non-destructive</b> <b>tests</b> are that (1) the process of deterioration during the aging test can be evaluated continuously using only one sample and (2) they are easier to conduct than destructive tests.|$|R
