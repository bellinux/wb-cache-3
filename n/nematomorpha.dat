25|$|The Ecdysozoa are protostomes, {{named after}} the common trait of growth by {{moulting}} or ecdysis. The largest animal phylum belongs here, the Arthropoda, including insects, spiders, crabs, and their kin. All these organisms have a body divided into repeating segments, typically with paired appendages. Two smaller phyla, the Onychophora and Tardigrada, are close relatives of the arthropods and share these traits. The ecdysozoans also include the Nematoda or roundworms, perhaps the second largest animal phylum. Roundworms are typically microscopic, and occur in nearly every environment where there is water. A number are important parasites. Smaller phyla related to them are the <b>Nematomorpha</b> or horsehair worms, and the Kinorhyncha, Priapulida, and Loricifera. These groups have a reduced coelom, called a pseudocoelom.|$|E
500|$|In 1971, the Dutch {{biologist}} C. A. W. Jeekel {{published a}} comprehensive listing of all known millipede genera and families described between 1758 and 1957 in his Nomenclator Generum et Familiarum Diplopodorum, a work credited as launching the [...] "modern era" [...] of millipede taxonomy. In 1980, the American biologist Richard L. Hoffman published a classification of millipedes which recognized the Penicillata, Pentazonia, and Helminthomorpha, {{and the first}} phylogenetic analysis of millipede orders using modern cladistic methods was published in 1984 by Henrik Enghoff of Denmark. A 2003 classification by the American myriapodologist Rowland Shelley {{is similar to the}} one originally proposed by Verhoeff, and remains the currently accepted classification scheme (shown below), despite more recent molecular studies proposing conflicting relationships. A 2011 summary of millipede family diversity by William A. Shear placed the order Siphoniulida within the larger group <b>Nematomorpha.</b>|$|E
2500|$|At its origin, the [...] "Nematoidea" [...] erroneously {{included}} Nematodes and <b>Nematomorpha,</b> attributed by von Siebold (1843).

2500|$|Modern {{taxonomy}} {{does not}} study criteria such as [...] "higher" [...] and [...] "lower" [...] states of development or distinctions between [...] "main" [...] and [...] "side" [...] branches—only family relationships indicated by cladistic methods are considered relevant. From {{this point of}} view, several common characteristics still support the Articulata hypothesis — segmented body; paired appendages on each segment; pairwise arrangement of waste-elimination organs in each segment; and above all, a rope-ladder-like nervous system based on a double nerve strand lying along the belly. An alternative concept, most widely accepted today, is the so-called Ecdysozoa hypothesis. This places the annelids and Panarthropoda in two very different groups: the former in the Lophotrochozoa and the latter in the Ecdysozoa. Mitochondrial gene sequences also provide support for this hypothesis. Proponents of this hypothesis assume that the aforementioned similarities between annelids and velvet worms either developed convergently or were primitive characteristics passed unchanged from a common ancestor to both the Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa. For example, in the first case, the rope-ladder nervous system would have developed {{in the two groups}} independently, while in the second case, it is a very old characteristic, which does not imply a particularly close relationship between the annelids and Panarthropoda. The Ecdysozoa concept divides the taxon into two, the Panarthropoda into which the velvet worms are placed, and the sister group Cycloneuralia, containing the threadworms (Nematoda), horsehair worms (<b>Nematomorpha)</b> and three rather obscure groups: the mud dragons (Kinorhyncha); penis worms (Priapulida); and brush-heads (Loricifera).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Nematomorpha</b> (sometimes called Gordiacea, and {{commonly}} known as horsehair worms or Gordian worms) are a phylum of parasitoid animals superficially similar to nematode worms in morphology, hence the name. They range in size in most species from 50 to 100 mm long and can reach in extreme cases up to 2 metres, and 1 to 3 mm in diameter. Horsehair worms can be discovered in damp areas such as watering troughs, swimming pools, streams, puddles, and cisterns. The adult worms are free-living, but the larvae are parasitic on arthropods, such as beetles, cockroaches, mantids, orthopterans, and crustaceans. About 351 freshwater species are known and a conservative estimate suggests {{that there may be}} about 2000 freshwater species worldwide. The name [...] "Gordian" [...] stems from the legendary Gordian knot. This relates to the fact that <b>nematomorpha</b> often tie themselves in knots.|$|E
5000|$|Morphological {{studies have}} {{traditionally}} placed the phylum in the vinctiplicata with the Priapulida; this plus the Kinorhyncha constitutes the taxon Scalidophora.

The Arthropoda, Onychophora, and Tardigrada have been grouped together as the Panarthropoda because they are distinguished by segmented body plans. Dunn et al. in 2008 suggested that the tardigrada could be grouped along with the nematodes, leaving Onychophora as the sister group to the arthropods.|$|E

Many other phyla are found there: Porifera (sponges) and Priapulida (burrowing “worms” which were ambush predators), Brachiopoda (these had bivalve-like shells, but fed by means of a lophophore, a fan-like filter which {{occupied}} about of half of the internal space), Chaetognatha (arrow worms), Cnidaria, Ctenophora (comb jellies), Echinodermata, Hyolitha (Lophophorata with small conical shells), <b>Nematomorpha,</b> Phoronida (horseshoe worms), and Protista.|$|E

50|$|Montgomery's {{earliest}} papers concerned ribbon worms (phylum Nemertea), a {{group on}} which he would write 10 papers.

He wrote on the taxonomy of wolf spiders (family Lycosidae), lynx spiders (Oxyopidae), and nursery web spiders (Pisauridae). In a 1909 paper detailing the anatomy and development of various organs in spiders he rejected a prevalent idea at the time that arachnids evolved from Merostomata (a group including horseshoe crabs and extinct sea scorpions) adapting to a terrestrial life, and proposed instead that the aquatic lifestyle of horseshoe crabs evolved from terrestrial ancestors.|$|E
50|$|Paragordius tricuspidatus {{belongs to}} the phylum <b>Nematomorpha,</b> and is known for {{manipulating}} the behavior of its host, the cricket Nemobius sylvestris. In its larval stage, the worm is microscopic, but grows into a large worm (10 - 15 cm) inside its host after accidental ingestion since their eggs are laid {{at the edge of}} the water by rivers where crickets frequently reside. Upon ingestion, the worm nourishes upon its host and fills the entire body cavity of the cricket, until maturation, when the parasitic worm is ready to exit into water to complete its life cycle, maximizing its reproductive success. The worm induces a peculiar behavior on its cricket host, which causes it to leap into water whereby the parasitic worm can slither out and find its mate, while the cricket often perishes.|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Biodiversity {{research}} combines two dimensions, {{the horizontal}} one that contains species diver-sity, patterns among this diversity and its interconnections and the vertical one {{that deals with}} the history of biodiversity, i. e., its phylogeny. With these tight interconnections, the importance of so-called ‘‘lesser known groups’ ’ such as <b>Nematomorpha</b> and Gastrotricha can be shown. Two examples are the life cycle of <b>Nematomorpha</b> and the phylogenetic position of Gastrotricha. The life cycle of <b>Nematomorpha</b> is only partially known and almost no conclusions can be made about the impact of <b>Nematomorpha</b> on their hosts. For the phylogenetic position of Gastrotricha, alternative hypotheses are available, mainly due to different results of morphological and molecular (18 S rDNA) analyses. It is demonstrated how these different hy-potheses influence character interpretation and reconstruction among Protostomia (Gastroneuralia) ...|$|E
