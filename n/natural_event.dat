5|$|The Pakistani {{government}} was severely criticised for its {{handling of the}} relief operations following the storm, both by local political leaders in East Pakistan and in the international media. In the December national elections, the opposition Awami League gained a landslide victory, gaining 160 of the 162 East Pakistani seats. Continuing unrest between East Pakistanis and the central government trigged the Bangladesh Liberation War, which concluded {{with the creation of}} the state of Bangladesh. This {{is one of the first}} times that a <b>natural</b> <b>event</b> helped to trigger a civil war.|$|E
25|$|The Thera {{eruption}} {{occurred during}} a mature {{phase of the}} LM IA period. Efforts to establish the volcanic eruption's date have been controversial. Radiocarbon dating has indicated a date in the late 17th century BC; this conflicts with estimates by archaeologists, who synchronize the eruption with conventional Egyptian chronology for a date of 1525â€“1500 BC. The eruption is identified as a <b>natural</b> <b>event</b> catastrophic for the culture, leading to its rapid collapse.|$|E

25|$|Records {{show that}} Valle Piola {{has always had}} but one street, Via della Fauna, {{which leads to the}} nearby village of Poggio Valle. Smaller paths, {{including}} a mule trail, have connected Valle Piola with Acquaratola (a hike of approximately 40 minutes by foot), the town cemetery, and Case Menghini. In the past, a carriageway provided a shortcut from Case Menghini to the Valle Piola cemetery. Frequently, heavy mountain rains made Via della Fauna impassable. In the 1950s a rudimentary bridge was constructed over the Rio de Valle thereby, largely eliminating the effects of this bothersome <b>natural</b> <b>event.</b>|$|E
25|$|As the {{conflict}} between East and West Pakistan developed in March, the Dacca offices of the two government organisations directly involved in relief efforts were closed {{for at least two}} weeks, first by a general strike and then by a ban on government work in East Pakistan by the Awami League. With this increase in tension, foreign personnel were evacuated over fears of violence. Relief work continued in the field, but long-term planning was curtailed. This conflict widened into the Bangladesh Liberation War in December and concluded with the creation of Bangladesh. This {{was one of the first}} times that a <b>natural</b> <b>event</b> helped trigger a civil war.|$|E
500|$|In the Revelation route, the Avatar rejects both Hoshido and Nohr, and is {{denounced as}} a traitor by both. They flee with Azura {{and one of}} their {{retainers}} through the Bottomless Canyon to the kingdom of Valla. Azura explains that the king of Valla, the dragon Anankos, has plans for humanity's destruction; {{he is the one}} who killed and replaced Garon, and he is responsible for Takumi's descent into madness in the Conquest route. Azura also reveals her history as the daughter of the king Anankos usurped, and that a curse placed by Anankos will kill them if they reveal Valla's existence to anyone outside its borders. The two decide to kill Anankos. Fleeing Valla with Gunter, who survived his fall into the chasm, Azura reveals that they must unite the Avatar's twin families before a <b>natural</b> <b>event</b> which will seal the passage for decades. The Avatar travels through Hoshido and Nohr, gradually gaining the trust and allegiance of their hereditary and adopted families. They also learn that their sword Yato is the [...] "Seal of Flames", which when combined with the other families' Legendary Weapons will become the Fire Emblem, capable of killing Ananakos. Once the group enter Valla, the party heads to confront Anankos. During their journey, they battle the resurrected bodies of Mikoto, Azura's mother Arete, and Sumeragi, the latter of whom is revealed to be Mikoto's assassin. During their battle with Mikoto, the Avatar learns that they and Azura are maternal cousins, making the Avatar heir to Valla's throne. The group is eventually betrayed by Gunter, who was possessed by Anankos since first coming to Valla, but the Avatar succeeds in freeing Gunter from Anankos' control. When they face Anankos, they are initially helpless, but Ryoma, Takumi, Xander, and Leo feed the power of their Legendary Weapons into Yato, transforming it into the Fire Emblem. Near death after being defeated, Anankos summons and eats the impostor Garon to regain his strength, but is finally destroyed with the Fire Emblem. In the aftermath, Valla is reestablished on the surface, Azura crowns the Avatar its new ruler, and an everlasting peace is established between the three kingdoms.|$|E

40|$|The {{advantages}} {{and limitations of}} using computer animated stimuli in studying motion perception are presented and discussed. Most current programs of motion perception research could not be pursued {{without the use of}} computer graphics animation. Computer generated displays afford latitudes of freedom and control that are almost impossible to attain through conventional methods. There are, however, limitations to this presentational medium. At present, computer generated displays present simplified approximations of the dynamics in <b>natural</b> <b>events.</b> Very little is known about how the differences between <b>natural</b> <b>events</b> and computer simulations influence perceptual processing. In practice, the differences are assumed to be irrelevant to the questions under study, and that findings with computer generated stimuli will generalize to <b>natural</b> <b>events...</b>|$|R
