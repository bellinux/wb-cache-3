500|$|The stab victim {{dies and}} Maddy blames herself, {{even though there}} was <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have done. [...] But Ric tells Maddy he has reconsidered and she can have an interview. Although she's happy to have this {{opportunity}} she knows that Ric is only doing it to avoid a court case.|$|E
500|$|Despite being {{relieved}} that war was over, Alice was {{appalled by the}} behaviour of Prussian troops in Hesse; Berlin took the grand duchy's railways and telegraph systems, and assessed Hesse for three million florins in indemnity. Alice wrote to her mother, who in turn wrote to Princess Victoria, who responded that there was <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do to relieve the [...] "painful and distressing position darling Alice was in", as it was [...] "one of the unavoidable results of this dreadful war". Influence came from the Emperor of Russia, who urged the Prussian King to allow the Grand Duke to keep his throne. The facts that the Emperor's mother was the Grand Duke's aunt, and Alice's sister being also the Prussian Crown Princess {{are likely to have}} influenced Prussia's generosity. However, Alice was angered by an untactful visit by Princess Victoria to the conquered region of Homburg, originally part of Hesse, shortly after it became Prussian territory.|$|E
60|$|<b>Nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{say would}} arouse him to action, and she finally {{allowed him to}} do as he pleased.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the maiden}} {{answered}} <b>nothing,</b> for <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not believe his words. And then, suddenly looking up, {{she pointed to}} the sea, and shrieked— ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What are {{you afraid}} of?" [...] she asked contemptuously. [...] "Jeanne {{suspects}} nothing, of course. There is <b>nothing</b> which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> suspect. <b>She</b> has not mentioned his name even." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure she}} will," [...] the {{sergeant}} said briefly, and then added, [...] "There is <b>nothing</b> else <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do," [...] and saluting {{he went out}} of the room.|$|R
60|$|Flora did not reply. She {{felt that}} in his present state of mind <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> say would comfort him.|$|E
60|$|THE YOUNGER MISS WETHERELL. It {{is so good}} of you--only, you--you will {{be careful}} there is <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> regard as a PERSONAL allusion.|$|E
60|$|Of {{medicine}} or surgery {{the poor thing}} knew <b>nothing.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> but lick the wounds, and thus she kept them cleansed, that healing nature might the more quickly do her work.|$|E
60|$|LADY SNEERWELL. 'Twas <b>nothing</b> {{but that}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{not bear to}} hear Charles {{reflected}} on notwithstanding their difference.|$|R
60|$|Ruth {{studied him}} with {{unobtrusive}} interest. It {{was obvious that}} he was not prospering, and he looked worn. This roused her compassion, though she realized that there was <b>nothing</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do. The man’s pride stood between them.|$|R
60|$|But for the moment, of course, {{there was}} <b>nothing</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> ask: <b>she</b> would be {{married in a}} couple of days--alas! so soon!--and after that it would be to her husband that she must look for devotion, for {{guidance}} and for sympathy.|$|R
6000|$|And Gyp went on smiling. Between that, and {{stabbing}} these false raptures to the heart, {{there seemed}} to be <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do. The moment his hands relaxed, she got up and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, John; {{certainly}} not. I {{think you}} should see that she wants for <b>nothing.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> live with her sister-in-law, and have {{the interest of the}} money that the Rubbs took from her. It was your money." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her across the {{blueberry}} bushes. His gay speech meant everything or <b>nothing.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> parry it with a jest, {{and then it would}} mean nothing. She let her head droop over her work, and made no answer.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> said <b>nothing</b> more, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not {{altogether}} repress a heartbroken moan, which {{rose from the}} intensity of her mental agony.|$|R
6000|$|Behind {{the dealer}} were sundry small {{cupboards}} in the wall. Two {{or three of}} these Charlotte had seen him open, so that her eyes found themselves resting on those he had not visited. But she completed her admission. [...] "There's <b>nothing</b> here <b>she</b> <b>could</b> wear." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{loved her}}. He loved her still. She {{was part of}} him, and <b>nothing</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do had power to alter that. She had deceived him, yes. But why had she deceived him? Because she loved him so much that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not bear to lose him. Dash it all, {{it was a bit}} of a compliment.|$|R
6000|$|Instinctively, {{she felt}} that her {{thoughts}} were leading her back again {{to a state of}} doubt from which her youthful hopefulness recoiled. Was there <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> find to do which would offer some other subject to occupy her mind than herself and her future? ...|$|E
60|$|Beth said <b>nothing.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> {{not find}} it in her heart as yet to forgive Diana's selfish {{conspiracy}} against her cousin's happiness. If Louise perished in this dreadful storm the proud Diana Von Taer could not escape the taint of murder. The end was not yet.|$|E
60|$|She {{drew the}} letter from her bosom, and with a steady hand dropped it into the box. The irreclaimable had now occurred. <b>Nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{henceforth}} say or do, no prayers or agonised vigils, no miracles even, could undo her action or save Paul Déroulède from trial and guillotine.|$|E
60|$|She {{kissed his}} hand and went slowly to her room, {{stumbling}} upstairs through a mist of tears. There was <b>nothing</b> more that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have loved}} you ever since I was a boy." [...] He paused {{as though he}} {{expected}} that she would make some answer to this; but {{of course there was}} <b>nothing</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> say. [...] "I have been true to you since we were together almost as children." ...|$|R
50|$|Clausen {{had already}} relinquished her parental rights {{so there was}} <b>nothing</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do. But Schmidt had not relinquished his parental rights so he could and did stop the {{adoption}} proceedings. The DeBoers, however, refused to accept that the adoption would not be completed, and returned home to Ann Arbor.|$|R
60|$|Oh, God! Who was this? Oh, God! {{there before}} her stood Dirk van Goorl. Dirk, {{and no other}} than Dirk, unless she dreamed, Dirk with his kind face wreathed in a happy smile, Dirk with his arms outstretched towards her. Lysbeth said <b>nothing,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not speak, only she stood still gazing, gazing, gazing, and always he came on, till now his arms were round her. Then she sprang back.|$|E
60|$|Ethelberta {{had been}} surprised, and very greatly, to find him, as it were, {{secreted}} {{in the very}} rear of her position. That <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> tell was new to him {{was a good deal}} to think of, but it was little beside the recollection that he had actually made his first declaration in the face of that knowledge of her which she had supposed so fatal to all her matrimonial ambitions.|$|E
60|$|But this {{improbable}} iniquity he had committed, and {{now there}} was <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not believe of him. In the first place it was quite manifest that he was tipsy; in the next place {{it was to be}} taken as proved that all his religion was sheer hypocrisy; and finally the man was utterly shameless. She therefore stood watching for the sound of his footfall, not without some fear that he might creep out at her suddenly from among the bushes.|$|E
60|$|The {{afternoon}} passed {{very slowly}} with the little, anxious lady, and {{every now and}} then she crept softly out of the tent and gazed expectantly up the steep hillside. Still, each time she did it, there was <b>nothing</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see except the long ranks of somber firs, and the oppressive silence was broken only by the sound of the river.|$|R
60|$|<b>Nothing</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have done, <b>nothing</b> that <b>she</b> had done, {{brought home}} to him like this the inner {{significance}} of her act. For the moment, perhaps, he understood nearly {{all there was to}} understand--understood that she loathed him, that she had loathed him for years, that {{for all intents and purposes}} they were like people living in different worlds, that there was no hope for him, never had been; even, that she had suffered--that she was to be pitied.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{will know}} that it was nothing, my dear. He is good-humoured and playful, and likes the feeling of making us feel that we are not strangers." [...] But Marion knew that Lord Hampstead would not take it as meaning <b>nothing.</b> Though <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see no more than his back as {{he walked out of the}} room, she knew that he was glowing with triumph.|$|R
60|$|In {{answer to}} this Mrs Dale could say <b>nothing.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not speak out her {{thoughts}} about Crosbie, and explain to Lily that he was unworthy of her love. Love does not follow worth, and is not given to excellence;--nor is it destroyed by ill-usage, nor killed by blows and mutilation. When Lily declared that she still loved {{the man who had}} so ill-used her, Mrs Dale would be silent. Each perfectly understood the other, but on that matter even they could not interchange their thoughts with freedom.|$|E
60|$|What was her market value? What {{could she}} do? She {{looked back at}} her life, and saw that she had dabbled. She had a little of most things--enough of <b>nothing.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> sketch a little, play a little, sing a little, write a little. Also--and, as she remembered it, she felt {{for the first time a}} tremor of hope--she could use a {{typewriter}} reasonably well. That one accomplishment stood out in the welter of her thoughts, solid and comforting, like a rock in a quicksand. It was something definite, something marketable, something of value for which persons paid.|$|E
60|$|Mr Brandon {{considered}} {{all this}} as stuff and nonsense. He could {{not deny that}} his branch of the Brandons had certainly got a good deal out of Mrs Keswick's family. But here {{was a chance to}} make everything all right again, and he would be delighted to see Junius, a relative, although a distant one, come into possession of Midbranch. As for the old lady's opposition, that should not be considered at all, he thought. It was his opinion that her mind had been twisted by her bad temper, and <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> say could hurt anybody.|$|E
60|$|Once, Bud Strothers {{came to see}} her. She sat in {{the front}} room and talked with him, noting with fascination that there were fringes to the heels of his trousers. Another day, the {{business}} agent of the union called. She told him, as she had told Bud Strothers, that everything was all right, that <b>she</b> needed <b>nothing,</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get along comfortably until Billy came out.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Ned," [...] said Lee, [...] "the {{fact that}} Mrs. Hale has a husband, and {{knows that she}} can't marry me, puts us on equal terms. <b>Nothing</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> learn about me {{hereafter}} would make a flirtation with me any less wrong {{than it would be}} now, or make her seem more a victim. Can you say the same of yourself and that Puritan girl?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then all the {{strength}} seemed {{to leave the}} girl. Moving shakily, with her hand on Eveline Annersly's arm, she turned towards the house, as the pearly greyness crept into the eastern sky. Eveline Annersly said <b>nothing,</b> for <b>she</b> <b>could</b> feel that her companion was trembling, and hear her catch her breath. Carrie stopped {{when they reached the}} homestead, and looked eastward with tear-dimmed eyes.|$|R
