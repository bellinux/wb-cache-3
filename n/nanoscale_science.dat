40|$|We {{describe}} two {{experiments to}} study the influence of fluctuations in the electron charge on the transport properties of a quantum dot. First, we scan a device from single- to double quantum-dot behavior by varying the conductance of a connecting point contact. Second, we measure the dependence of the charging energy on the conductance of the barriers. The experiments are compared with traces obtained from a theory based on a Luttinger liquid type description. This theory predicts a scaling behaviour of the charging energy, in good agreement with our experiments. Comment: 15 pages, LateX, with 6 figures embedded using epsf.

40|$|Molecular {{electronics}} and plasmonics are both very promising fields in <b>nanoscale</b> <b>sciences</b> {{in which their}} combination is a big challenge. This thesis {{is divided into two}} parts. First, we studied the conductance of two differently capped benzodifuran derivatives in a mechanically controllable break junction setup. Based on the results of the electrical transport measurements, we discuss possible binding sites of both molecules to the gold electrodes. Secondly, we present photoluminescence measurements of gold nanostructures. Lithographically fabricated gold antennas were investigated by a confocal laser microscope. Gold nanostructures are a candidate for optoelectronic devices where optically active molecules such as benzodifuran-derived compounds can interact with light to achieve further functionality. We studied the dependence of single-photon photoluminescence {{on the size of the}} gold antenna. Here, we applied successfully a plasmon-enhanced photoluminescence model onto the measured spectra to explain the dependence in detail. Interestingly, we observed an additional peak in the spectra of long antennas which we assigned to a radiative decay at the interband absorption edge. Our investigations provide additional insight into this feature, which remains to date only poorly studied. Furthermore, we investigated the coupling between two closely located monopole antennas and described the shift of the dipole resonance energy by plasmon ruler equations. ...|$|R
40|$|Small {{multicellular}} organisms such as nematodes, fruit flies, clawed frogs, and zebrafish {{are emerging}} models for {{an increasing number}} of biomedical and environmental studies. They offer substantial advantages over cell lines and isolated tissues, providing analysis under normal physiological milieu of the whole organism. Many bioassays performed on these alternative animal models mirror {{with a high level of}} accuracy those performed on inherently low-throughput, costly, and ethically controversial mammalian models of human disease. Analysis of small model organisms in a high-throughput and high-content manner is, however, still a challenging task not easily susceptible to laboratory automation. In this context, recent advances in photonics, electronics, as well as material sciences have facilitated the emergence of miniaturized bioanalytical systems collectively known as Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC). These technologies combine micro- and <b>nanoscale</b> <b>sciences,</b> allowing the application of laminar fluid flow at ultralow volumes in spatially confined chip-based circuitry. LOC technologies are particularly advantageous for the development of a wide array of automated functionalities.
