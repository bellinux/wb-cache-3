40|$|In <b>near</b> <b>video-on-demand,</b> {{requests}} for a video file arriving within {{a period of}} time are batched together and served with a single multicast stream; thereby reducing the bandwidth requirement compared with the unbatched case. Since the delayed users may renege (and hence causing revenue loss to the service providers), the design of a <b>near</b> <b>video-on-demand</b> system has to meet users' delay expectation. In this paper, we specify the minimum number of streams required for a video file so that {{only a small fraction of}} the users experience delay higher than a certain value. Trade-off issues between user's delay tolerance and the required number of streams are also addressed. 1. INTRODUCTION Video-on-demand (VOD) refers to video services in which a user is able to request from a server any video content at any time. VOD encompasses many applications such as movie-on-demand, news-on-demand, distance learning, home shopping, various interactive training programs, etc. [1, 2] In pure-VOD, each use [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In a <b>near</b> <b>video-on-demand</b> (near-VOD) system, {{requests}} {{for a movie}} arriving {{in a period of}} time are grouped (or “batched”) together and served with a single multicast stream. In this paper, we consider providing near-VOD services when there is a cost associated with using a network multicast channel. We address the tradeoff between system profit, given by the total pay-per-view collected minus the total channel cost, and user delay or user loss (due to reneging). We first analyze and compare the tradeoff of two traditional “basic ” schemes, namely, the window-based schemes in which a maximum user delay can be guaranteed, and the batch-size based scheme in which system profit can be guaranteed. By combining these basic schemes, we present a scheme which can adaptively balance system profit and user delay when the underlying request rate fluctuates. We then consider the case in which delayed users may renege and determine how system profit can be maximized by sizing the batching period given user’s reneging behavior. We show that maximizing profit can lead to excessively high user loss rate, especially when the channel cost is high and users are not very patient. Therefore, a shorter suboptimal batching period should be used for this case in reality. We finally introduce schemes which are able to offer high profit or low user loss when the underlying arrival rate fluctuates.

40|$|A true {{video-on-demand}} {{system allows}} users to view any video program, at any time, and perform any VCR functions, but its per-user video delivery cost is too expensive to have commercial use. Periodic broadcasting (PB), which is a <b>near</b> <b>video-on-demand</b> technique, broadcasts videos repeatedly over broadcast channels. In this way, PB can service an unlimited number of clients simultaneously with a bounded service latency. We propose a data retrieval scheme, consisting of buffer management and data placement, for PB servers. Unlike existing schemes devised for a specific PB technique, our scheme can be adopted by general PB. Furthermore, it is devised considering variations in disk load induced by VBR-encoded videos...|$|E
40|$|Video-on-Demand is {{becoming}} most sought after multimedia applications. It {{is difficult to}} attain a true video-on-demand (TVOD) system, so <b>near</b> <b>video-on-demand</b> (NVOD) is catching the attention of people. In NVOD, requests are multicast in different streams. Important issue in this system is the choice of batching time. Traditionally the batching time is fixed depending {{on the number of}} requests. In this paper we have suggested an adaptive batching scheme (ABS) where batching time is adjusted according to the current arrival rate, which follows the hyper-exponential distribution pattern. A comparison is made between the fixed and adaptive batching schemes. Numerical illustrations are provided to show that adaptive batching policy is better than fixed batching policy for optimizing bandwidth requirements. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Broadcasting is a {{prospective}} approach to support <b>near</b> <b>video-on-demand</b> services with light communication over-head. By letting clients share channels, such approaches involve partitioning a video into segments and repeatedly broadcasting these segments in multiple channels. An early paper proposed a broadcasting scheme called RFS (recursive frequency splitting), which can significantly reduce clients ’ waiting time. While efficient, RFS {{suffers from a}} high computational complexity of (log), where {{is the number of}} segments of the video, which is typically very large. This paper proposes an efficient segmentation scheme, which can significantly reduce the compu-tational overhead by slightly sacrificing the number of segments that can be arranged as compared to RFS.

A <b>Near</b> <b>Video-On-Demand</b> (NVOD) system uses a more scalable approach by hatching multiple clients to a shared stream or broadcasting videos. Staggered video broadcasting, one of the NVOD techniques, broadcasts multiple streams of the same video at staggered times, with one stream serving multiple clients.

Consider a film S {{is divided into}} n equal parts {S 1, S 2, …, Sn} and played through k channels. Each segment Si must appear at least once every i+c- 1 segments rather than i segments. The value of parameter c means that the users have to wait the time of c segments. Each channel of k channels is first partitioned into subchannels by a heuristic strategy. Then, a greedy approach is applied to assign the n segments to k channels. The waiting time is c times the duration of one segment. As a result, the proposed method outperforms the previous broadcasting methods {{in terms of the}} maximum waiting time, for the same number of channels...|$|E

Resource sharing techniques can be used to address this problem. We evaluate through extensive simulation major resource sharing techniques from different classes, considering both the True Video-on-Demand (TVOD) and <b>Near</b> <b>Video-on-Demand</b> (NVOD) service models. The TVOD model helps in analyzing the server communication bandwidth and disk I/O bandwidth requirements, whereas the NVOD model helps in comparing the achieved throughput, waiting times, and unfairness towards unpopular videos. We utilize this extensive analysis in developing a workload aware hybrid solution (WAHS) that combines the advantages of the best among resource sharing techniques. Moreover, we propose a statistical cache management approach (SCM) and derive analytical models for optimal cache allocation to reduce the demands on the disk I/O when various resource sharin...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-In this paper, we employ Genetic Algorithm (GA) {{technique}} for minimizing the average bandwidth requirement in <b>Near</b> <b>Video-on-Demand</b> (NVoD) system. Three multicasting schemes are presented which require lesser bandwidth {{as compared to}} true Video-on Demand (VoD) systems. Scheme 1 is a double rate batching scheme in which the late arriving customers are served with unicast stream having double transmission rate until they get merged with the multicast stream. Scheme 2 is a client-buffering technique in which the unicast customers are allowed to concurrently buffer {{some part of the}} movie from the ongoing multicast stream. In scheme 3, the late arriving customers are served with bundled channels of incrementally increasing transmission rate. All the schemes are compared {{on the basis of the}} required bandwidth i. e. average number of I/O streams. The optimal batching time and the minimum streams required are determined by using GA.

40|$|Fast {{broadcasting}} (FB) is {{a popular}} <b>near</b> <b>video-on-demand</b> system where a video is divided into equal size segments those are repeatedly transmitted {{over a number of}} channels following a pattern. For user satisfaction, it is required to reduce the initial user waiting time and client side buffer requirement at streaming. Use of additional channels can achieve the objective. However, some augmentation is required to the basic FB scheme as it lacks any mechanism to realise a well defined relationship among the segment sizes at channel transition. Lack of correspondence between the segments causes intermediate waiting for the clients while watching videos. Use of additional channel requires additional bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a modified FB scheme that achieves zero initial clients waiting time and provides a mechanism to control client side buffer requirement at streaming without requiring additional channels. We present several results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FB scheme over the existing ones. Comment: 2014 9 th International Forum on Strategic Technology (IFOST...|$|E

40|$|In <b>near</b> <b>video-on-demand</b> (near-VoD), {{requests}} for a video title are grouped together (i. e. batched) and are {{served with a}} single multicast stream, thereby {{increasing the number of}} concurrent users which can be supported by the system. Since users {{may not be able to}} tolerate the delay incurred by batching and hence cancel their requests, a hatching policy should be designed so as to achieve low user loss and high revenue (given by the total pay-per-view (PPV) collected over a long period of time across all movies). We propose an adaptive batching policy which offers users low delay at low arrival rate, and gates the allocation of the channels at high rate. Such adaptivity is achieved by the use of a simple `token-tray' (TT) scheme, etc., which governs when a stream may be allocated to a movie. In assigning a movie to a stream, we propose a weight function which depends on the user queuing-time and its PPV (hence the term `weighted queuing-time' (WQT). By comparing our batching policy (TT/WQT) with a number of traditional ones (first-come-first-served (FCFS), forced-wait (FW), batch-size-based (BSB), scheme, etc.), our scheme is shown to achieve the highest revenue and lowest loss rate even when the arrival rate changes, with the user loss rate across the movies being fairly uniform, and the user delay being fairly low even at high arrival rate.
