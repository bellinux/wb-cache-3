5000|$|A Vapor Trap Diode is {{fabricated}} in {{a similar}} fashion to a Variable Conductance Heat Pipe (VCHP), with a gas reservoir {{at the end of the}} condenser. During fabrication, the heat pipe is charged with the working fluid and a controlled amount of a <b>Non-Condensable</b> <b>Gas</b> (NCG). During normal operation, the flow of the working fluid vapor from the evaporator to the condenser sweeps the NCG into the reservoir, where it doesn’t interfere with the normal heat pipe operation. When the nominal condenser is heated, the vapor flow is from the nominal condenser to the nominal evaporator. The NCG is dragged along with the flowing vapor, completely blocking the nominal evaporator, and greatly increasing the thermal resistivity of the heat pipe. In general, there is some heat transfer to the nominal adiabatic section. Heat is then conducted through the heat pipe walls to the evaporator. In one example, a vapor trap diode carried 95 W in the forward direction, and only 4.3 W in the reverse direction.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} reasons of the {{discrepancies}} between theoretical predictions made by models of absorbers of H 2 O-LiBr absorption chillers when they are compared with experimental results under real conditions is the presence of <b>non-condensables</b> <b>gases.</b> These <b>non-condensables</b> <b>gases</b> are inside the shell of the absorption chiller mainly for two reasons: i) air leakages (Oxygen-Nitrogen); ii) gases produced by corrosion (Hydrogen). A mathematical model of falling film absorption of H 2 O by LiBr aqueous solutions which considers the influence of <b>non-condensable</b> <b>gases</b> has been implemented. The model is semi-empirical, based on Navier Stokes equations together with energy and mass species simplified under the boundary layer hypotheses. Under such conditions, the differential system of equations in partial derivatives, becomes parabolic and could be solved by means of finite difference method in a step by step procedure. Detailed heat and mass transfer balances are applied at the interface to specify the boundary conditions between liquid and gas phases. In order to calculate gradient of air at the interface, the penetration theory is applied in order to avoid a detailed calculation of the gas phase. Numerically the presence of air in the interface results in a pressure drop and consequently in a reduction in heat and mass transfer rates. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R

50|$|VCHPs {{have two}} {{additions}} {{compared to a}} standard heat pipe: 1. A reservoir, and 2. A <b>Non-Condensable</b> <b>Gas</b> (NCG) added to the heat pipe, {{in addition to the}} working fluid; see the picture in the Spacecraft section below. This NCG is typically argon for standard VCHPs, and helium for thermosyphons. When the heat pipe is not operating, the NCG and working fluid vapor are mixed throughout the heat pipe vapor space. When the VCHP is operating, the NCG is swept toward the condenser end of the heat pipe by the flow of the working fluid vapor. Most of the NCG is located in the reservoir, while the remainder blocks a portion of the heat pipe condenser. The VCHP works by varying the active length of the condenser. When the power or heat sink temperature is increased, the heat pipe vapor temperature and pressure increase. The increased vapor pressure forces more of the NCG into the reservoir, increasing the active condenser length and the heat pipe conductance. Conversely, when the power or heat sink temperature is decreased, the heat pipe vapor temperature and pressure decrease, and the NCG expands, reducing the active condenser length and heat pipe conductance. The addition of a small heater on the reservoir, with the power controlled by the evaporator temperature, will allow thermal control of roughly ±1-2 °C. In one example, the evaporator temperature was maintained in a ±1.65 °C control band, as power was varied from 72 to 150 W, and heat sink temperature varied from +15 °C to -65 °C.|$|E

A series of developmental thermosyphons were operated at nominal operating temperature with accelerated gamma irradiation exposures on the same order of magnitude that is expected in eight years of heat rejection system operation.
