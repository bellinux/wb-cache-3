The consultation provision required the Bureau to consult with the FWS before it renewed contracts that controlled water rights in the delta smelt’s habitat. To use the ESA’s citizen suit provision, a plaintiff must establish Article III standing. The NRDC was able to satisfy all three elements of Article III standing: injury in fact, causation, and available redress. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that a non-governmental organization could have Article III standing to challenge a federal agency’s violation of the ESA consultation requirement.

5000|$|After section 208's {{failure to}} control NPS water pollution, in 1987 Congress passed the Water Quality Act {{and created the}} new section 319 {{to address the problem}} of nonpoint sources. However, some critics have argued that section 319 {{provides}} little improvement over section 208. The section requires states to identify water bodies that cannot meet water-quality standards without control of nonpoint sources. [...] The states must then identify best management practices and measures for those impaired sources, along with an implementation plan. The EPA approves these plans, and if a state fails to develop a plan, the EPA must do so for the state. However, there are a number of problems with these provisions. Funding to develop the plans has been scarce. [...] The section does not actually place limits on NPS pollution, and states are not even required implement the plans they create. Another problem with 319 (and 208) is that there is no enforcement mechanism In the case <b>Natural</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Defense</b> Council v. EPA, 915 F.2d 1314, 1318 (9th Cir. 1990), the court held that “Section 319 does not require states to penalize nonpoint source polluters who fail to adopt best management practices; rather it provides for grants to encourage the adoption of such practices.” ...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{enactment}} of environmental legislation in the 1970 s, the preliminary injunction standard articulated by the Supreme Court for environmental claims has evolved from general principles to enumerated factors. In Winter v. <b>Natural</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Defense</b> Council, Inc., the Court’s most recent refinement, the Court endorsed but failed to explain {{the application of a}} common four-factor test when it held that the alleged injury to marine mammals was outweighed by the public interest of a well-trained and prepared Navy.

50|$|Local {{foods are}} {{sometimes}} {{considered the most}} climate friendly because the energy needed to store and transport the meat {{is removed from the}} equation. There is a decrease in greenhouse gases emitted because locally grown goods {{do not need to be}} transported across the country, or constantly cooled in large refrigerators. Another benefit of locally grown food is its lower concentration of pollution sources. According to the USDA, more than 335 million tons of manure are produced annually in American farms. In factory farms, this waste is extremely concentrated, and without proper regulation and disposal, the waste pollutes the surrounding areas. The <b>Natural</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Defense</b> Council even remarks that factory farms have reached a point in which the farms threaten public health. Pollutants from the manure and urine of overcrowded factory farms lead to water and air pollution. Some of these pollutants, such as hydrogen sulfide and various nitrates, are dangerous even at low levels. Factory farms are also considered unsanitary because they place animals in overcrowded conditions in fully enclosed rooms that often become the perfect breeding grounds for diseases. Locally grown foods support free-range or pasture-grazing farming methods, decreasing the need for large factory farms. With fewer factory farms, waste will not be so concentrated and will thus not have such profound effects on the immediate surrounding areas.|$|R

A report in June 2011 by the <b>Natural</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Defense</b> Council listed Avalon as having one of the 10 most chronically polluted beaches in the United States. The pollution was caused by the city's sewer system, made of century-old clay and metal pipes. By 2011, city had spent $3.5 million testing and rehabilitating sewer lines, but the water was no cleaner. In February 2012, a cease and desist order was issued against the City for illegally discharging polluted water into the bay. After the cease and desist order, the city invested an additional $5.7 million on sewer main improvements and inspection and tracking systems.

5000|$|The <b>Natural</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Defense</b> Council (NRDC), {{a special}} {{interest}} group independent of the California Energy Commission, released a document in 2005 detailing the energy per capita {{of the state of}} California as well as the energy per capita of the United States as a whole. From 1976 to 2005, California's energy per capita fluctuated around 6,500 kilowatt-hours per capita whereas the US roughly went from 8,000 kilowatt-hours to 12,000 kilowatt-hours per capita. The document also states that Rosenfeld's titles, such as titles 20 and 24, which are responsible for setting energy efficiency standards, have saved California from needing to build 21 power plants. For California's per capita energy consumption to remain constant as the growing population increased its dependence on electricity, increases in efficiency had to keep up with electricity's increasing utility. The article also credits Rosenfeld's energy saving targets, his focus on research and development, his ability to integrate energy efficiency into resource procurement, his provision of [...] "performance-based incentives", his capability to motivate utility companies to segregate revenues from sales, his willingness to have progress towards targets measured by a third party, and his implementation of [...] "well-designed programs" [...] as additional reasons for California's leadership in energy efficiency. One [...] "well-designed program" [...] the article cites is the subsidization of compact fluorescent lamps and how different methods were undertaken to make the cost drop from $25 a bulb in the 1980s to $3 a bulb in 2005, which saved a typical Californian family on average of about $1000 per year. [...] The NRDC estimates California saves approximately $42 billion a year from just four of Rosenfeld's initiatives: the invention of DOE-2 (a computer program that builds energy analysis--$10 billion per year) and the implementation of high-frequency ballasts ($5 billion per year), low-e windows (estimated $5-$10 billion per year), and more efficient refrigerators ($17 billion per year). Beyond saving energy and money, Rosenfeld's actions at California's Energy Commission have also helped paint California as an example to the United States in carbon dioxide emissions, setting California's per capita emissions to half the national average in 2000.|$|R
