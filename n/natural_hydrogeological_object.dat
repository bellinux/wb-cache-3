40|$|A multidimensional, mountain-scale, thermal-hydrologic (TH) {{numerical}} model is presented for investigating unsaturated flow behavior {{in response to}} decay heat from the radioactive waste repository in the Yucca Mountain unsaturated zone (UZ), Nevada. The model, consisting of both two-dimensional (2 -D) and three-dimensional (3 -D) representations of the UZ repository system, {{is based on the}} current repository design, drift layout, thermal loading scenario, and estimated current and future climate conditions. This mountain-scale TH model evaluates the coupled TH processes related to mountain-scale UZ flow. It also simulates the impact of radioactive waste heat release on the <b>natural</b> <b>hydrogeological</b> system, including heat-driven processes occurring near and far away from the emplacement tunnels or drifts. The model simulations predict thermally perturbed liquid saturation, gas- and liquid-phase fluxes, and water and rock temperature elevations, as well as the changes in water flux driven by evaporation/condensation processes and drainage between drifts. These simulations provide mountain-scale thermally perturbed flow fields for assessing the repository performance under thermal loading conditions...|$|R
40|$|Hazardous waste {{disposal}} ranges from discarding a burning cigarette butt {{from the car}} window to getting rid of highly toxic waste products. Managing {{waste disposal}} in all its various forms to mitigate {{the impact on the}} environment remains the ultimate challenge. However, the environment is very forgiving up to a certain point and one needs to understand exactly where this point is. Studies in Europe have shown that the groundwater impacts of unlined general waste sites seldom extend beyond 1000 m down gradient of the site. However, practically all waste disposal sites are “leaking ” to some degree with leachate entering the subsurface, either because of inadequate or failed protection measures, or even because of mis-management. It largely depends on the characteristics of the <b>natural</b> <b>hydrogeological</b> environment {{and the nature of the}} protection measures how far this impact will extend.

40|$|In {{the direct}} use of {{geothermal}} energy without fluid extraction, heat transfer takes place with no alteration of the <b>natural</b> <b>hydrogeological</b> {{balance of the}} basin. An interesting solution both for thermal energy and power production could be the application of heat pipe principle, in particular the Closed Loop Two Phase Thermosyphons (CLTPT). In shallow or not much deep geothermal reservoirs with temperature below 100 C, the two phase closed loop thermosyphon can transfer heat very efficiently. In this case the most important task is the enhancement of the heat transfer mechanism between the heat exchanger and the aquifer. In {{the first part of}} the paper a review of particular applications connected to the geothermal heat pipe applications is proposed, then an analysis of the main technical elements regarding the geothermal aquifer exploitation through two phase thermosyphon systems are given.

30|$|A {{sustainable}} {{strategy for}} conjunctive water management must include {{information on the}} temporal and spatial availability of this natural resource. Because of water shortages in the dry seasons, farmers on the Upper Plain of the Chao Phraya River basin, Thailand, are increasingly using groundwater to meet their irrigation needs. To evaluate the possibilities of conjunctive water management in the area, the spatial–temporal changes in the water table of the Younger Terrace Aquifer were investigated. First, a regional geomorphological map based on field surveys, remote sensing and previous environmental studies was developed. Then, the well data were analyzed in relation to rainfall, streamflow, yield and pumpage, and the data were interpolated using geostatistical techniques. The results were analyzed via integrated zoning based on color theory as applied to multivariate visualization. The analysis results indicate areas {{that would be more}} suitable for groundwater extraction in a conjunctive management framework with regard to the <b>natural</b> <b>hydrogeological</b> processes and the effects of human interaction. The kriging results were compared with the geomorphological map, and the geomorphological areas exhibit distinct hydrogeological patterns. The western fans exhibit the best potential for the expansion of conjunctive use, whereas the borders of the northern fans exhibit the lowest potential.|$|R

Design charts and equations (or correction factors) are presented. Simple analytical flow and transport models are also developed. These simple models are found to be efficient and economical to use in the design of landfills; and, they give comparable results with sophisticated numerical models.;The 2 ̆ 2 ratio method 2 ̆ 2 used in the interpretation of pumping tests to evaluate the bulk vertical hydraulic conductivity of an aquitard has some limitations (or errors). To overcome these limitations, the response of a piezometer (installed in an aquitard) to a pumping test in an adjacent aquifer has been studied using a finite-element technique based on Biot theory. Anisotropy of the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard is also considered. Correction factors are presented to correct the errors due to time lag and the length effect associated with the simple piezometers used in pumping tests. The effects of the borehole diameter and the presence of a sand pack are also studied.;Design charts and equations are developed to design the layout of leachate extraction (purge, pump) wells which may be used, as a backup to the leachate collection system, to control leachate mounding in landfills, if there has been a failure of the leachate collection system or if there is no leachate collection system. Anisotropy of the hydraulic conductivity of the waste, the leakage through the liner and the plugging of wellbore are considered. Correction factors are presented to account for the plugging of the wellbore. The effects of having a higher leachate level in the well are also investigated.;Simple analytical flow models are developed for two-layer and multi-layer aquitard-aquifer systems. To solve the equations and the iterative procedure involved in these models, two computer programs are developed. These flow models are considered suitable for sensitivity studies to assist in the preliminary design of landfills, initial calibration of hydrogeological models and to prepare velocity input for transport models. The interactions between the engineered system and the <b>natural</b> <b>hydrogeological</b> system of landfills are studied using these models. The potential for 2 ̆ 2 shadow effect 2 ̆ 2 is also examined for two hypothetical landfills.;The application of simple transport models, such as POLLUTE, in modelling landfills which are engineered with drainage layers is verified.

30|$|The Lottenbachtal is {{characterized}} by very complex hydrological and hydrogeological characteristics due to the variety of land uses and the complex geological structure. The mining activities of the Ruhr Carboniferous disturbed the <b>natural</b> <b>hydrogeological</b> conditions by conduits, represented by drainage shafts. These features have relatively high flow velocities. The mining shafts intersect with other tectonic and lithological feature forming a complex groundwater flow system. The soil cover {{of the study area}} has extremely low hydraulic conductivity, which increases the direct surface runoff and reduces the groundwater recharge. The settlement areas also increase the direct surface runoff and reduce the groundwater recharge due to the large impervious areas. For this reason, the direct surface runoff generated in this area is extremely high in comparison with the other components of the hydrologic cycle. The groundwater recharge occurs chiefly by the mining and the tectonic features. The limited extension of the mining facilities and the low hydraulic conductivities of the unsaturated zone and the aquifer are responsible for the low groundwater recharge. The absence of the predominant water types in most of the water sources in this area is another result {{of the impact of the}} land use diversity, where the surface water and the groundwater flow through different flow paths and feed each other. The rainy days are characterized by the precipitation value ranged between 0.1 and 5  mm/day. The most common relative humidity values ranged between 55 and 80  %. The most predominant minimal air temperature ranged between 0 and 15  °C, while the most predominant maximal air temperatures ranged between 5 and 15  °C. The actual evapotranspiration constitutes 31.90  % of the total precipitation, while the direct surface runoff constitutes 61.04  %, the soil water constitutes 3  % and the groundwater recharge constitutes only 4  % of the total precipitation.|$|R
40|$|Vulnerability {{assessment}} of the aquifers is an important tool for the groundwater management and protection. This paper aims to assess the intrinsic vulnerability of the karst aquifer feeding Pertuso spring, {{which is going to}} be exploited to supply an important water network of the South part of Rome. The study area is located in the Upper Valley of Aniene river and belongs to an important karst aquifer, mainly composed of dolomitic limestones and dolomites of Cretaceous age. The limestones outcropping in the Upper Valley of Aniene river are deeply fractured and karst erosion has occurred on a large scale in this area. The surface karst activity led to the formation of a typical karst landscape. The hydrogeological framework is therefore closely related to the karst nature of carbonate rocks, constituting the reliefs strongly shaped by surface and underground karst activities. The peculiar fragility of this aquifer, feeding Pertuso spring, requires a special attention to protect catchment area, which is directly affected by the <b>natural</b> <b>hydrogeological</b> budget of the aquifer. Therefore, for the evaluation of vulnerability index and maps COP method was applied considering overlying layers (O), concentration of flow (C) and precipitation regime (P) parameters. The vulnerability of the karst aquifer is classified mainly as moderate, high and very high due to the presence of cemented conglomerates, compact dolomitic limestones and granular limestones, respectively. COP method shows that each factor has a different effect on vulnerability index evaluation, however the highest correlation was observed with O factor due to the absence of soil formations. The results obtained by COP method assess the aquifer vulnerability to contamination and are useful for managing the protection of groundwater resources, especially to avoid contamination of karstic aquifers, and land use planning in the area...|$|R

The SVCD well field located in the thickest, most productive region of the Saline Valley Aquifer lies directly adjacent to a reclaimed coal mine. Subsurface movement and surface discharge from the mine {{has been shown to}} be responsible for deterioration of water quality in the surrounding area, including the aquifer. Previous studies conducted in the region have addressed water supply issues and simulated contaminant transport from the reclaimed mine. The limited scope of these models did not extend to <b>natural</b> <b>hydrogeological</b> boundaries. This study extended the model boundaries to natural boundaries including the Saline River to the south, the Wabash and Ohio Rivers to the east, and the bedrock high pinch-out and fining valley textures to the west. The flow model uses parameters from each study as a base then calibrated to 18 discrete head measurements. Initial contaminant transport runs using values from previous studies show successful mine reclamation except for surface discharge to a nearby ditch from well pumping. An analysis was performed that varied parameters to determine if any likely scenarios may cause the plume to travel farther than anticipated. These scenarios include things such as cessation of surface discharge, increasing contaminant source load, and altering recharge and hydraulic conductivity. In all cases sulfate concentrations in the SVCD production wells modeled up to 155 mg/L which is under the EPA drinking water guideline for sulfate. Three wells in particular, SVCD- 1, SVCD- 4, and SVCD- 7 never model higher than 7 mg/L indicating that several wells lie outside the influence of the sulfate plume.

This Model Report was planned in ''Technical Work Plan (TWP) for: Performance Assessment Unsaturated Zone'' (BSC 2002 [160819], Section 1. 12. 7), and was developed in accordance with AP-SIII. 10 Q, Models. In this Model Report, any reference to ''repository'' means the nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, and any reference to ''drifts'' means the emplacement drifts at the repository horizon. This Model Report provides the necessary framework to test conceptual hypotheses for analyzing mountain-scale hydrological/chemical/mechanical changes and predict flow behavior in response to heat release by radioactive decay from the nuclear waste repository at the Yucca Mountain site. The mountain-scale coupled TH/THC/THM processes models numerically simulate the impact of nuclear waste heat release on the <b>natural</b> <b>hydrogeological</b> system, including a representation of heat-driven processes occurring in the far field. The TH simulations provide predictions for thermally affected liquid saturation, gas- and liquid-phase fluxes, and water and rock temperature (together called the flow fields).

The TH Model captures mountain-scale three dimensional (3 -D) flow effects, including lateral diversion at the PTn/TSw interface and mountain-scale flow patterns. The Mountain-Scale THC Model evaluates TH effects on water and gas chemistry, mineral dissolution/precipitation, and the resulting impact to UZ hydrological properties, flow and transport.

40|$|A short {{review of}} the current hydrogeological {{knowledge}} of the Clyde Basin, including the city of Glasgow, has been carried out, and activities to address knowledge gaps have been proposed. The hydrogeological datasets available or potentially available within BGS, Glasgow City Council and other sources are identified. These include national datasets such as maps of aquifer productivity, superficial deposits permeability and thickness, likely depth to water in superficial deposits, and groundwater vulnerability; and databases such as water boreholes, groundwater chemistry and aquifer properties. They also include local datasets such as mine plans, historical mine water pumping data, groundwater levels and groundwater discharges, and groundwater contamination events. The complex hydrogeology of the Clyde Basin is poorly understood. Groundwater flow {{in most of the}} bedrock aquifers, both sedimentary and volcanic, occurs dominantly in fractures. Extensive mining in many of the Carboniferous sedimentary rocks has significantly changed <b>natural</b> <b>hydrogeological</b> conditions. Groundwater flow paths in the sedimentary aquifers are likely to be relatively deep and long, with Glasgow acting as the focal point for much of the groundwater discharge from the Clyde coalfield area. Groundwater flow systems in Carboniferous volcanic rocks are likely to be predominantly local, with discharge occurring as baseflow to local rivers. The natural chemistry of groundwater in Carboniferous sedimentary aquifers is often moderately to highly mineralised. Groundwater quality was also affected by mining in the 19 th century. There is little recent information on groundwater chemistry in either the sedimentary or volcanic aquifers. Little is known of the hydrogeology of the superficial deposits across the area, although they are likely {{to play an important role}} in controlling recharge to the underlying bedrock aquifers, and in influencing surface water drainage. Consultation with representatives from Glasgow City Council has highlighted the following hydrogeological issues: sustainable urban drainage (the role of groundwater in flooding and the potential for discharging surface water to the subsurface); the lack of good quality groundwater data; the hydrogeological characteristics of made ground; the hydrogeological impacts of mining; and the potential presence of poor quality groundwater. Improving understanding of the hydrogeology of the Clyde Basin, and addressing the hydrogeological issues, will require the development of hydrogeological conceptual models of the superficial deposits and the bedrock aquifers. Effective conceptual model development will depend on the availability and quality of data, and should be staged so that simple models are produced first to cover the whole area, which can be refined as new information becomes available. The development of more complex hydrogeological models should be linked to the current development by BGS of detailed 3 D geological models for a small pilot study area in eastern Glasgow, whereby that the existing geological models are attributed with hydrogeological parameters and used as the basis for a numerical groundwater model.

40|$|Groundwater is an {{important}} natural resource {{and ought to be}} protected. Groundwater recharge and contamination are two important aspects in groundwater management. Both these aspects apply to the vadose zone. The research aimed to narrow the knowledge gap between practising geohydrologists and engineering geologists, both frequently involved in vadose zone investigations for geohydrological and engineering purposes respectively. The vadose zone is the portion of the geological profile above the groundwater surface and is usually characterised by unsaturated conditions. Matrix forces counteract the force of gravitation to hold liquid in the porous medium and are reflected by hydraulic heads lower than atmospheric pressure (suction). The unique relationship between soil-water content and suction is presented by soil-water characteristic curves. Flow of liquids is directly proportional to the hydraulic gradient and the hydraulic conductivity and is affected by the geometric properties of the pore channels. In unsaturated soils, flow is governed by both matrix and gravitational forces. Preferential flow is the process by which water and solutes move along preferred pathways through a porous medium. Important hydrogeological properties, such as porosity, hydraulic conductivity and soil-water retention characteristics, can be estimated from geotechnical data. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity can also be estimated from soil-water characteristic curves and saturated hydraulic conductivity. The experimental procedures comprised analyses of existing hydrogeological data, laboratory tests and field experiments. The geotechnical data were used to predict important hydrogeological properties and these predictions were compared to experimentally derived hydrogeological properties. The effects of preferential flow and soil variability were also investigated. Predictions of porosity, hydraulic conductivity and soil-water retention characteristics lack precision, owing mostly to the <b>natural</b> variability in <b>hydrogeological</b> properties and inherent errors of the empirical models. Accurate predictions of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity were based on experimentally derived saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil water characteristic data. The study area is located in Midrand and is underlain by granitoid rocks that had been subjected to a number of geomorphologic events. The land system classification approach was used to delineate the hydrogeological units. The different hydrogeological characteristics can be attributed mainly to the position of the hydrogeological units in respect of the topographical setting, the geomorphologic history and the underlying geology. A conceptual hydrogeological model was constructed for each of the hydrogeological zones and its significance in respect of groundwater recharge and vulnerability discussed. The research has shown that geohydrological properties can be estimated from geotechnical data with various degrees of accuracy. Predictions of hydraulic conductivity, soil water retention characteristics and porosity are not suitable for site-specific investigations, but it can be used during the feasibility phases. In cases where saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil-water retention characteristics have been experimentally derived, estimations of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity are adequate for site-specific investigations. The land system approach can be used to delineate areas of similar geohydrological characteristics and these can be used in the compilation of aquifer vulnerability and groundwater recharge maps.
