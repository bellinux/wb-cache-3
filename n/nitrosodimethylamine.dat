Compounds presenting heterocyclic rings substituted with DMA functions (e. g. ranitidine) show much higher conversion rates to NDMA than other tertiary amines or DMA. The concentration of dissolved oxygen was found to play a major role: with ranitidine, in absence of dissolved oxygen almost no NDMA was formed, while the NDMA molar yield was 54 % in saturated O 2 solution.

In rats treated orally with benzene (1. 5 ml kg-'), toluene (2. 0 ml kg-') or m-xylene (2. 0 ml kg-I) 1 6 2 4 h prior to DCM (3 mmol kg-', i. p.), the carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) level was elevated, reaching peaks in blood at 21 %, 16 % and 23 %, respectively, compared to the peak of ca. 10 % in rats treated with DCM only. Their effects on COHb generation were highly dependent on the time interval between each AHC and DCM treatment, since an early administration of m-xylene or toluene decreased the COHb elevation. The half-life of DCM in blood was shortened significantly, indicating that the metabolic degradation of DCM was enhanced by the AHCs. Disulfiram (3. 4 mmol kg-I, p. 0.) blocked COHb elevation completely, suggesting that the metabolic conversion of DCM to CO is mediated by cytochrome P- 450 2 E 1 (P 4502 E 1).

40|$|AbstractSINTEF Materials and Chemistry has {{recently}} designed an advanced laboratory test rig for studies of solvent degradation. This solvent degradation test rig (SDR) emulates the process conditions observed in an absorber/stripper configuration designed for CO 2 capture. Aqueous solvent is degraded by cycling in a combined absorber and stripper setup with realistic temperatures and CO 2 loadings of the solvent {{in addition to}} a defined synthetic flue gas mixture. A 14 week test campaign with degradation of 30 wt. % 2 -ethanolamine (MEA) was performed in the rig. Comparison between group methodology and specific nitrosamine analysis of the solvent showed that 42 % of the nitrosamines were unidentified species. This indicates that many of the MEA degradation products are likely precursors for nitrosamine formation. Two nitrosamines were identified in the solvent; nitrosodiethanolamine (NDELA) and the nitrosamine of the degradation product N-(2 -hydroxyethyl) -glycine (HEGly) : nitroso-(2 -hydroxyethyl) -glycine (NHEGly). 56 % of the total nitrosamine was identified as NHEGly, while 2 % was NDELA. <b>Nitrosodimethylamine</b> (NDMA) was detected in the absorber gas emission, but was below the quantification limit in the solvent. Results indicate that the degradation of nitrosamines and nitramine in the solvent is highly temperature dependent, and that the levels of total nitrosamines and MEA-nitramine are significantly reduced by elevated stripper temperature. The results show that the SDR results give a realistic picture on the solvent degradation to be expected in a real CO 2 capture plant; degradation products formed in the SDR MEA solvent reflects those previously found in pilot plant studies. This demonstrates how the SDR enables bench-scale studies of solvent process degradation previously only available from pilot plant studies.

40|$|<b>Nitrosodimethylamine</b> (NDMA) is a nitrosated amine {{that has}} been {{associated}} with a 10 - 5 increase in lifetime cancer risk at the ng/L level. NDMA may be formed from a variety of anthropogenic amine precursors during drinking water treatment utilizing chloramines as a disinfectant. In this dissertation, ten veterinary antibiotics were tested for their ability to form NDMA. The antibiotics were tested at different pH, temperature, chlorine to ammonia weight ratio (Cl 2 /NH 3) and time to determine the impact of these factors on formation. Molar conversions ranged from 0. 04 to 4. 9 percent, with antibiotics containing more than one dimethylamine (DMA) functional group forming significantly more NDMA. The highest formation for most of the compounds was seen near pH 8. 4. The effect of Cl 2 /NH 3 ratio, temperature, and hold time was somewhat varied for each chemical, suggesting that the effects of these parameters were compound-specific. This suggests that large-scale farming run-off may be a new source NDMA precursors. NDMA formation is slowed by the presence of natural organic matter (NOM). It is not currently known which components of NOM are responsible for the reduction in NDMA formation. In this dissertation, water containing NOM was fractionated into different MW size groups or separated based on polarity. The high molecular weight NOM fractions (> 10 kDa), polar and charged components were shown to be the most effective in reducing the amount of NDMA formed. Some precursors have high sorption coefficients to NOM, which is the likely mechanism for reduction of NDMA formation from these compounds. Lastly, NDMA formation can be highly impacted by numerous factors relevant to drinking water treatment. In this dissertation, water samples and treatment plant data were collected from approximately 20 drinking water treatment plants in the U. S. and Canada over 2 years. Linear mixed effects models with random intercepts, which account for variability between treatment plants, were used to assess variable significance and create predictive equations. UV 254 concentration in the plant influent, sucralose concentration, polyDADMAC concentration, pre-chlorination time, Cl 2 /NH 3 ratio, use of GAC, water pH, and biofiltration were associated with NDMA concentration in the distribution system...|$|E

Disinfection with chloramines {{is known to}} significantly reduce the formation of regulated DBPs as compared to chlorination. However, chloramination favors the formation of N nitrosamines, including N <b>nitrosodimethylamine</b> (NDMA), a probable human carcinogen. The formation mechanisms of NDMA are not fully understood. Proposed mechanisms used dimethylamine (DMA) as a model precursor, but some studies indicated that amounts of dimethylamine present in surface waters or secondary municipal wastewaters cannot be sufficient to explain the amount of NDMA formed. NDMA precursors in natural organic matter (e. g. humic substances) are not fully determined. The potential importance of tertiary amines presenting dimethylamine functional groups (e. g. ranitidine, a histamine antagonist often used for peptic ulcer treatment) has been pointed. In this study, the reactivity with monochloramine of several nitrogen-containing organic compounds is investigated. This reactivity is leading {{to the formation of}} NDMA and haloacetonitriles (HANs), another type of nitrogenous DBPs. Model compounds investigated include two phenylurea herbicides (diuron, isoproturon) and pharmaceuticals (ranitidine, doxepine, amitriptyline, mifepristone and minocycline). All of them are tertiary amines presenting DMA functional groups. Simultaneous analysis of nitrosamines in aqueous samples is based on a solid-phase extraction procedure followed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis in electron impact ionization mode. This method reaches extraction efficiencies of ~ 70 %, and a method detection limit of 33 ng/L. Preformed monochloramine with a Cl:N molar ratio of 1 : 1. 2 is used for chloramination experiments. After 5 days at pH 8, ranitidine shows the highest molar conversion rate with 70 % NDMA formed. Conversion rates for other pharmaceuticals are in the range of 0. 7 to 5 % and less than 0. 5 % for diuron and isoproturon. Ranitidine formed about 10 times more NDMA than HANs. For other substances tested, amounts of HANs formed are quite similar to those of NDMA. The pharmaceutical ranitidine shows much higher conversion rates to NDMA than other tertiary amines or DMA. These variations cannot be explained by current proposed mechanisms, based on DMA as a precursor. Compounds presenting heterocyclic rings substituted with DMA functions form more NDMA than compounds with DMA functions near carbonyl groups (diuron). New formation mechanisms have to be proposed to explain the importance of structural characteristics of tertiary amines compounds for NDMA formation. The influence of chloramination conditions (pH, dose, contact time) will be investigated in further researches...|$|E
