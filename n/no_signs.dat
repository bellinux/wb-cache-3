5|$|A {{large number}} of {{decompression}} experiments were done using goats, which were compressed for three hours to assumed saturation, rapidly decompressed to surface pressure, and examined for symptoms of decompression sickness. Goats which had been compressed to 2.25 bar absolute or less showed <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> of DCS after rapid decompression to the surface. Goats compressed to 6 bar and rapidly decompressed to 2.6 bar (pressure ratio 2.3 to 1) also showed <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> of DCS. Haldane and his co-workers concluded that a decompression from saturation with a pressure ratio of 2 to 1 was unlikely to produce symptoms.|$|E

By using a small, isolated beach where the Japanese had not anticipated an assault, the force achieved tactical surprise, but the islands proved to be far from unoccupied. A furious battle over the islands ensued.|$|E

However, Mulder finds tracks leading to the area that appear to change from human to something more animal in nature. Scully dismisses this, but finds a large section of shed human skin nearby. She believes that the Parkers knowingly killed Goodensnake, but knows that they could not have skinned him since <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> of such injury were found on the body.|$|E
5|$|Bartlett {{decided to}} send a team back to {{establish}} {{the exact location of}} the island that the Anderson party had approached, and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there.

Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.|$|E
