5|$|In 1871, Mendeleev {{published}} his periodic {{table in a}} new form, with groups of similar elements arranged in columns rather than in rows, and those columns numbered I to VIII corresponding with the element's oxidation state. He also gave detailed predictions for the properties of elements he had earlier noted were missing, but should exist. These gaps were subsequently filled as chemists discovered additional <b>naturally</b> <b>occurring</b> elements. It is often stated that the last <b>naturally</b> <b>occurring</b> element to be discovered was francium (referred to by Mendeleev as eka-caesium) in 1939. However, plutonium, produced synthetically in 1940, was identified in trace quantities as a <b>naturally</b> <b>occurring</b> element in 1971.|$|E
5|$|<b>Naturally</b> <b>occurring</b> {{dysprosium}} {{is composed}} of seven isotopes: 156Dy, 158Dy, 160Dy, 161Dy, 162Dy, 163Dy, and 164Dy. These are all considered stable, although 156Dy decays by alpha decay with a half-life of over 1×1018years. Of the <b>naturally</b> <b>occurring</b> isotopes, 164Dy is the most abundant at 28%, followed by 162Dy at 26%. The least abundant is 156Dy at 0.06%.|$|E

5|$|<b>Naturally</b> <b>occurring</b> {{tungsten}} {{consists of}} five isotopes whose half-lives are {{so long that}} they can be considered stable. Theoretically, all five can decay into isotopes of element 72 (hafnium) by alpha emission, but only 180W has been observed to do so with a half-life of (1.8 ± 0.2)×1018 years; on average, this yields about two alpha decays of 180W in one gram of natural tungsten per year. The other <b>naturally</b> <b>occurring</b> isotopes have not been observed to decay, constraining their half-lives to be at least 4×1021 years.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Rh and atomic number 45. It is a rare, silvery-white, hard, corrosion resistant and chemically inert transition metal.
