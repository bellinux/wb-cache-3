5000|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union, Federal <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> Service of Russia was created on December 30, 1993, and given a status of separate government agency. This organization retained some old traditions, most notably the dark green-colored uniform and [...] "Border Guarder's Day" [...] (an official holiday commemorated by celebrations of ex-servicemen). First minister of FBS (Federal Border Service) was Andrei Nikolayev, young and outspoken general who later became deputy of the State Duma. Russian <b>Border</b> <b>Guards</b> were also stationed outside of Russia most notably in southern Tajikistan, in order to <b>guard</b> the <b>border</b> with Afghanistan, until summer 2005. On Afghan-Tajik border on many occasions they were engaged in heavy fighting with drug-traffickers and Islamic extremists.

40|$|<b>Border</b> <b>guards</b> are {{the first}} actors that asylum-seekers and {{refugees}} encounter when crossing <b>national</b> <b>borders</b> to seek asylum. What assures the capacity of <b>border</b> <b>guards</b> is training and, in the European context, the European Union border agency Frontex has developed a common <b>border</b> <b>guard</b> training regime that European Union Member States have participated in forming. This article asks what impact this Frontex training has brought {{to the field of}} European Union external border management. Building upon the works of sociological institutionalists, it argues that Frontex training has brought an integrative effect to the field with the effects of socialization and professionalization at a European level. These effects, which are brought through the use of common training and training materials, have promoted the sharing of the views of <b>border</b> <b>guards</b> {{and the creation of a}} professional community at the European level. This implies that the way that policies are implemented on the ground is largely shifting toward convergence. It is also identified that what supports the high degree of participation in Frontex training is the understanding of Member States that participation converges with their interests in relation to others in the same field...|$|R
