40|$|Femtosecond laser {{machining}} has huge potential to impact micro/nanofluidics with {{its ability to}} arbitrarily abricate 3 -dimensional geometries with feature sizes down to nanometer scales. Because cleanroom facilities, multilayer configurations, and glass bonding are not necessary to achieve 3 -dimensional subsurface nanofeatures in glass, current planar lithography-etch-bond processes are easily combined with femtosecond {{laser machining}}; a hybrid machining based on these two methods constitutes a promising fabrication method for next generation microchip processes. The major challenge facing fs laser machining is that increasing the length of subsurface capillaries is very difficult; the normalized length (length/diameter) had previously been limited to 50. In this dissertation, a new phenomenon, acoustic nodeformation, is shown to be the major barrier to increasing capillary length, and a theoretical model for node formation is established. Based on the <b>node</b> <b>equation,</b> degassed water, which is introduced to the ablation site to assist machining, is found to substantially overcome node formation. Thus, a novel degassed-water-assisted fs laser machining process is developed, improving the normalized length of submicron-scale capillaries to longer than 1000. Nano-capillary electrophoresis (nCE) is demonstrated, initiating a submicronscale separation regime with millisecond-fast separations and 1 femtoliter injection volumes (1000 times smaller than a single cell volume). Also, the current-controlled dielectric breakdown is found to convert a thin glass wall to an electrode, which is the core part in the nCE device zero-flow sample loader. This phenomenon can be further exploited in many novel micro/nanofluidic modules such as electrokinetic pumps, nanosensors, and nanoactuators with freedom to directly embed these modules in glass chips. These new micro/nanofluidic devices and modules will contribute to many novel biotechnology investigations, including single cell proteomics, cell characterization, DNA analysis, electrophysiology, and biological assays...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for the computation of optimal feedback flow rates (flow velocities and flow discharges) for pedestrian evacuation from {{a network of}} corridors using network-wide pedestrian congestion data. The pedestrian flow is defined in a macroscopic sense, wherein ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for each corridor and node are obtained using the conservation of pedestrian mass. The effect of congestion on the flow velocities and discharges in the corridor and the corridor intersections is explicitly modeled. Collectively, these corridor and <b>node</b> <b>equations</b> define the state-space model of the pedestrian flow in the network. The state variables signify the congestion in a corridor or an intersection, whereas the control variables directly affect the flow velocities and the flow discharges. For this model, an optimization-based control algorithm is developed to ensure a maximum total instantaneous input discharge that is subject to tracking the optimal congestion state and boundedness of the control variables. A comparison of the simulation results in the controlled and uncontrolled scenarios shows superior performance in the controlled case due to convergence to the optimal congestion state and consistently high network input and exit discharges...|$|R

The method can increase the efficiency and accuracy of simulation-based design by improving physical-domain model reduction and preventing the use of inappropriate decoupling assumptions. A full model is first generated using the bond graph formalism. The relative contributions {{of the terms of}} the generalized Kirchoff loop and <b>node</b> <b>equations</b> are computed by calculating and comparing an aggregate measure of the power flow through the individual bonds connected to each 1 - and 0 -junction. Negligible aggregate bond power at a junction represents an unnecessary constraint term. Such bonds are replaced by a source modulated by the output of that junction. If separate bond graphs joined by modulating signals result, then the model can be partitioned into driving and driven subsystems. While the algorithm is not restricted to bond graph representations of system models, the formalism is shown to greatly facilitate its implementation and heighten the physical insight gained thereby. The algorithm is demonstrated for a slider-crank mechanism. The case study illustrates that decoupling can be found without the modeler relying on a priori assumptions, and that the computation speed and ease of use of the model increase after partitioning. The validity of decoupling assumptions can be tracked as the design and environment change. I...|$|R
