40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the pros and}} cons of a Transatlantic Free Trade Area (TAFTA) in comparison with an informal trade-facilitating marketplace between Europe and the US. It finds considerably more cons, especially since TAFTA would be expected to produce larger, more detrimental discriminatory effects on dynamic <b>non-member</b> <b>economies,</b> mainly in Asia but also in food-exporting regions as well. Efficiency-enhancing effects are argued to be achievable under a marketplace concept which does not separate insiders from outsiders. It is also shown that in foreign direct investment (FDI) and FDI-related service trade, TAFTA seems redundant as in recent years bilateral capital and trade flows have proven to be buoyant without preferential treatment. ...|$|R

Taiwan, under the name ‘Chinese Taipei’[*], is an observer to some of the committees of the OECD, including the Competition Committee (since 2001) and the Steel Committee (since 2005). As <b>non-member</b> <b>economies,</b> both Taiwan and China are competing for participation in committees and in other OECD sub-groups such as working parties and working groups. Both participated in high-level steel talks and in the special negotiating group on a ship-building agreement. Both eventually became observers of the Steel Committee in 2005, although China’s status was a full participant whereas Taiwan was not. China has been regularly invited by the OECD to attend various committee meetings and events, whereas Taiwan’s invitations are based on ad-hoc arrangements. Taiwan’s desire to increase its activities in various committees as an observer has been dwarfed by China’s opposition (WikiLeaks 2013). Efforts aimed at global poverty reduction are sometimes compromised by political considerations.|$|R

Misunderstandings of the impact of charges and collecting information can be costly. Furthermore, private pensions will for most people be their most valuable asset or second most valuable after their home. However, measuring the price of financial services is more difficult than other goods and services. Fees can take many different forms. Different kinds of charge interact and accumulate in complex ways, particularly with long-term products, such as pensions and life insurance. This often means that the price of financial services is not transparent...|$|R

Section 3 looks at the structural changes in the economy and trade dynamics behind the changes. Section 4 takes a closer look at structural adjustment in four sectors, the cut-flowers, processed tuna, cereals, and textiles and clothing. Section 5 concludes with lessons learnt. Ecuador provides a case of a country whose trade liberalisation and other structural reforms have led to mixed results. While trade liberalisation has improved resource allocations, macroeconomic instability, incomplete reforms, weak institutions and relatively restrictive (but also highly informal) labour markets have made it difficult for Ecuador to reap the full benefits of trade liberalisation. trade, exchange rate policy, liberalisation, cut flower, cereals, Ecuador, textiles and clothing, structural equation modelling, liberalization, macroeconomic instability, import-substitution, processed tuna, tariffs...|$|R

This paper revisits and elaborates on specific parts of these policy recommendations with a view to reassessing their applicability to developing countries. The five background studies; a comparison study comparing East Asia and Latin America and four country case studies (Chile, Ecuador, the Philippines and Thailand), which were conducted as a part of this project, form the basis for the analysis, supplemented by existing literature. The report consists of 4 main sections; The first section provides an introduction and the second section provides an overview of the liberalisation experiences of the four countries. In the third section, some of the ?recommendations in OECD (2005) are revisited with a greater focus on developing countries, covering such issues as i) trade and investment policies, ii) macroeconomic policy, iii) social safety nets and labour market policies, iv) policies to facilitate export response, v) institutional frameworks and regulatory and competition environment, vi) role of multilateral cooperation and regional and bilateral initiatives, and vii) broad based approach to reforms.

This paper studies the trade liberalisation experience of Chile from 1973 onward. The report consists of 5 main parts; Part 1 provides the introduction, part 2 looks at the trade liberalisation in Chile which was implemented in three phases, (1) initial trade reforms (1973 - 84), (2) trade reform after a temporary policy reversal(1985 - 89) and (3) after 1990. Part 3 looks at the evolution and structure of exports and imports, and Part 4 looks at sectoral developments in the copper industry, agrofood industry, wood and wooden products industry and the textiles and clothing industry. Part 5 concludes with lessons learnt. The experience of Chile shows that trade reform has been essential for realigning the incentive structures in Chile. A stable macroeconomic environment, trade reform starting with the elimination of quantitative restrictions, introduction of flat tariffs, coherent exchange rate policy, sound institutional framework, rule of law, mild promotion of exports, use of foreign capital, and relatively flexible labour market policies have been important factors in Chili's successful trade liberalisation experience. trade, exchange rate policy, liberalisation, copper industry, export promotion, unilateral tariffs, structural equation modelling, liberalization, textile and clothing industry, macroeconomic instability, import-substitution, tariffs, Chile, regional trade agreements, agro-food industry, forestry and wood sector, social and labour policies...|$|R

This paper studies the trade liberalisation experience of Thailand from the 1970 s. The report consists of 6 main sections; Section 1 provides the introduction, while section 2 provides an overview of Thailand's growth experiences. Section 3 takes {{a closer look at the}} trade liberalisation and investment policies in Thailand: Thailand's initial trade regime and three phases of trade liberalisation: (1) initial tariff reforms (1982 - 84), (2) comprehensive tariff reform and its reversal with the Asian financial crisis (1993 -), and (3) post crisis reforms (1999 -) are studied. Section 4 looks at the changes in the investment and trade structure, while section 5 takes a closer look at structural adjustment in three sectors, the automotive and auto-parts sector, textile and clothing, and the telecom services sector. Section 6 concludes with lessons learnt. Thailand's experience confirms that a sound macroeconomic environment, sustainable public finances, a relatively stable political and economic environment, flexible labour markets and reliable infrastructure are crucial for economic growth. It provides an example of gradual trade liberalisation, and demonstrates the benefits of openness to international trade and foreign investment in correcting distortions in the economy. trade, exchange rate policy, liberalisation, textiles and clothing, liberalization, telecommunication services, structural adjustment, macroeconomic instability, import-substitution, automotive and auto-parts, tariffs, Thailand...|$|R

This paper studies the trade liberalisation experience of the Philippines from the 1980 s. The report consists of 7 main parts; Part 1 provides the introduction, part 2 looks at the economic policies in the Philippines from the 1970 s, and part 3 takes a general look at the general structure of the economy. Part 4 takes {{a closer look at the}} trade liberalisation in the Philippines which was implemented in three phases, (1) initial trade reforms (1981 - 88), (2) second phase (1991 - 93) and (3) third phase (1994 - 96). Part 5 takes an overview of the structural adjustments which took place in manufacturing and agriculture, with Part 6 taking a closer look at four sectors, electronics, food processing, cement, and business process outsourcing sectors. Part 7 concludes with lessons learnt and opportunities and challenges for further liberalisation. Despite considerable liberalisation including in trade policy since the 1980 s, the Philippines economy posted only lacklustre performance initially. After a growth period in the 1990 s and the Asian crisis, it is only in the recent past that some of the reforms are starting to pay off. The importance of a stable political and macroecnomic environment, need for appropriate exchange rates, need for early elimination of quantitative restrictions in trade reform, early deregulation on FDI are some of the lessons learnt. While challenges remain, better results are expected in the future if complemented with further reforms. trade, exchange rate policy, liberalisation, export processing zones, cement, business process outsourcing and IT services, liberalization, structural adjustment, Philippines, macroeconomic instability, import-substitution, tariffs, electronics, food processing...|$|R

40|$|The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS) is {{the most}} {{successful}} legally binding instrument of the World Customs Organization (WCO) with 156 contracting parties. More and more countries and economic regions are applying the HS nomenclature worldwide. But not all member states are applying the same version of the HS nomenclature. Developing countries are allowed to use another (earlier) version of the nomenclature according to article 4 HS, however the WCO does not define the term 2 ̆ 01 cdeveloping countries 2 ̆ 01 d. In the main section this paper discusses the term 2 ̆ 01 cdeveloping countries 2 ̆ 01 d and examines the nomenclature application by HS member states and non-member states. It displays data from 2008 and 2017 on the positon of HS parties regarding the version of the nomenclature they apply and explains that not only developing nations are not applying the most actual HS 2017 nomenclature but also two advanced economies (Iceland and Singapore) : 83 out of 156 contracting parties have successfully implemented the HS 2017 and 56 HS member states are still using older HS versions. Four contracting parties are planning to implement the HS 2017 in 2018 and one in 2019. 46 HS applicants are so called non-members and not HS member states in 2017. Three <b>non-members</b> are advanced <b>economies</b> (all three are WTO members) : Hong Kong, Macao and Liechtenstein.
