25|$|The {{eruption}} of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, {{the second largest}} terrestrial {{eruption of}} the 20th century, affected the climate substantially, subsequently global temperatures decreased by about 0.5°C (0.9°F) {{for up to three}} years. Thus, the cooling over large parts of the Earth reduced surface temperatures in 1991–93, the equivalent to a reduction in <b>net</b> <b>radiation</b> of 4 watts per square meter. The Mount Tambora eruption in 1815 caused the Year Without a Summer. Much larger eruptions, known as large igneous provinces, occur only a few times every fifty – one hundred million years – through flood basalt, and caused in Earth past global warming and mass extinctions.|$|E
25|$|Climate, {{especially}} temperature, {{is obviously}} a factor in determining distributions of northern flora. Halliday and Brown (1943) suggested that white spruce’s northern limit corresponds “very closely” with the July mean monthly isotherm of 10°C in Ungava, but that the northern limit west of Hudson Bay was south of that isotherm. Other climatic factors that have been suggested as affecting the northern limit of white spruce include: cumulative summer degree days, position of the Arctic front in July, mean <b>net</b> <b>radiation</b> especially during the growing season, and low light intensities (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Topography, soil conditions, and glaciation may also be important in controlling northern limits of spruce (Drew and Shanks 1965).|$|E
25|$|Relationships between {{global climate}} {{and changes in}} ice extent are complex. The mass balance of {{land-based}} glaciers and ice sheets {{is determined by the}} accumulation of snow, mostly in winter, and warm-season ablation due primarily to <b>net</b> <b>radiation</b> and turbulent heat fluxes to melting ice and snow from warm-air advection,(Munro 1990). However, most of Antarctica never experiences surface melting. Where ice masses terminate in the ocean, iceberg calving is the major contributor to mass loss. In this situation, the ice margin may extend out into deep water as a floating ice shelf, such as that in the Ross Sea. Despite the possibility that global warming could result in losses to the Greenland ice sheet being offset by gains to the Antarctic ice sheet, there is major concern {{about the possibility of a}} West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapse. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is grounded on bedrock below sea level, and its collapse has the potential of raising the world sea level 6–7 m over a few hundred years.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Glaciers in {{northern}} and southern Norway are subject to different daily and seasonal cycles of incoming solar radiation, which is presumably reflected {{in the importance of}} <b>net</b> solar <b>radiation</b> in their surface energy balance. We present a 3 year continuous record from an automatic weather station in the ablation zone of the ice cap Langfjordjøkelen, one of the most northerly glaciers of mainland Norway. Despite its location at 708 N, Langfjordjøkelen was found to have a maritime climate, with an annual mean air temperature of – 1. 08 C, frequent cloud cover and end-of-winter snow depths over 3 m in all three years. The main melt season was May–October, but occasional melt events occurred on warm, cloudy winter days. Net solar and longwave radiation together accounted for 58 % of the melt energy, with a positive contribution by <b>net</b> longwave <b>radiation</b> (7 %). The sensible and latent heat fluxes supplied the remainder of the melt energy. Cloud optical thickness over Langfjordjøkelen was larger than on two glaciers in southern Norway, especially in the summer months.

Monthly average hourly values for the storage of energy flux were estimated using the energy balance residual and parameterisation methods. The energy balance residual method used in situ observations of <b>net</b> all-wave <b>radiation</b> and turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat. The anthropogenic heat flux and horizontal net heat advection were not considered. The parameterisation method, based on the objective hysteresis model, used <b>net</b> all-wave <b>radiation</b> and land use information inferred from a 1 -km radius area centred at the main observational site.

50|$|There {{are several}} energy fluxes {{involved}} in the melting of snow. These fluxes can act in opposing directions, that is either delivering heat to or removing heat from the snowpack. Ground heat flux is the energy delivered to the snowpack from the soil below by conduction. Radiation inputs to the snowpack include <b>net</b> shortwave (solar <b>radiation</b> including visible and ultraviolet light) and longwave (infrared) <b>radiation.</b> <b>Net</b> shortwave <b>radiation</b> is the difference in energy received {{from the sun and}} that reflected by the snowpack because of the snowpack albedo. Longwave radiation is received by the snowpack from many sources, including ozone, carbon dioxide, and water vapor present in all levels of the atmosphere. Longwave radiation is also emitted by the snowpack in the form near-Black-body radiation, where snow has an emissivity between 0.97 and 1.0. Generally the <b>net</b> longwave <b>radiation</b> term is negative, meaning a net loss of energy from the snowpack. Latent heat flux is the energy removed from or delivered to the snowpack which accompanies the mass transfers of evaporation, sublimation, or condensation. Sensible heat flux is the heat flux due to convection between the air and snowpack.|$|R
