In 2012, the city council approved plans for a new $10 million library, but ballot measures backed by the group Save Gladstone blocked the financing and construction pending specific voter approval.

5|$|On March 15, Washington defused the Newburgh {{situation}} by {{giving a speech}} to the officers. Congress ordered the Army officially disbanded in April 1783. In the same month, Congress passed a <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> for a twenty-five-year impost—which Hamilton voted against—that again required the consent of all the states; it also approved a commutation of the officers' pensions to five years of full pay. Rhode Island again opposed these provisions, and Hamilton's robust assertions of national prerogatives in his previous letter were widely held to be excessive.|$|E
5|$|Instead, the {{commission}} – whose members included Lagrange, Laplace, Monge and Condorcet – {{decided that the}} <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> should be equal to one ten-millionth of {{the distance from the}} North Pole to the Equator (the quadrant of the Earth's circumference), measured along the meridian passing through Paris. Apart from the obvious nationalistic considerations, the Paris meridian was also a sound choice for practical scientific reasons: a portion of the quadrant from Dunkerque to Barcelona (about 1000km, or one-tenth of the total) could be surveyed with start- and end-points at sea level, and that portion was roughly {{in the middle of the}} quadrant, where the effects of the Earth's oblateness were expected to be the largest.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, the Census Bureau {{introduced}} a new supplemental poverty measure aimed at providing a more accurate picture of the true extent of poverty in the United States. The SPM extends the official poverty measure by taking account {{of many of the}} government programs designed to assist low-income families and individuals that are not included in the current official poverty measure. According to this <b>new</b> <b>measure,</b> 16% of Americans lived in poverty in 2011, compared with the official figure of 15.2%. The <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> also estimated that nearly half of all Americans lived in poverty that year, defined as living within 200% of the federal poverty line.|$|E
25|$|The British Weights and Measures Act of 1824 {{repealed}} all existing British {{weights and}} measures legislation, some {{dating back to the}} 1300s, and redefined existing units of measure. In particular, a new standard yard and troy pound were manufactured as the standards for length and weight respectively. A <b>new</b> <b>measure,</b> the imperial gallon, which replaced the many gallons in use, was defined as being the volume of 10pounds of water at 62°F which, after the authorized experiments, was found to be 277.274 cubic inches. The bushel, which like the gallon, had definitions reflecting the various gallons, was defined as 8imperial gallons.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, 25% of {{fatalities}} {{of firefighters}} {{are caused by}} vehicle accidents while responding to or returning from an incident. Many firefighters are also injured or killed by vehicles while working at an incident (Paulison 2005). Recently (November 24, 2008) a <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> was established by many departments that requires firefighters to wear a bright yellow reflective vest over their turnout coats while working on the scene of vehicle accidents. The advent of this measure was implemented so firefighters are more visible to the other drivers on the road. In addition to the direct dangers of firefighting, cardiovascular diseases account for approximately 45% of on duty firefighter deaths.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the method used}} for an outlook on road safety in the Netherlands until 2020. The objectives of the outlook are to judge the feasibility of the Dutch road safety policy targets and to estimate the effects in 2020 of <b>new</b> <b>measures.</b> The outlook consists of baseline forecasts assuming the unchanged continuation {{of the effect of}} current road safety policy as a starting point, and the effect of <b>new</b> <b>measures</b> on top of that. We used four different mobility scenarios, derived from a comprehensive study about the macro-economic development of Dutch society until 2040. In the mobility scenario with the largest growth it appeared doubtful whether the policy targets of that time for the maximum number of fatalities in 2020 (580) can be achieved. An extensive inventory of <b>new</b> <b>measures</b> after 2010 produced five already intended <b>new</b> <b>measures,</b> the effects of which were estimated. The results show that the target of maximum 580 fatalities in 2020 can probably be met. The recently adjusted policy target of 500 fatalities in 2020 is also feasible if additional <b>new</b> <b>measures</b> are taken. (Author/publisher...|$|R

500|$|Talleyrand, Assemblée {{representative}} of the clergy, revolutionary leader and former Bishop of Autun, at the prompting of the mathematician and secretary of the Académie Condorcet, approached the British and the Americans in early 1790 with proposals of a joint effort to define a common standard of length based {{on the length of}} a pendulum. [...] Great Britain, represented by John Riggs Miller and the United States represented by Thomas Jefferson agreed in principle to the proposal, but the choice of latitude for the pendulum proved to be a sticking point: Jefferson opting for 38°N, Talleyrand for 45°N and Riggs-Miller for London's latitude. [...] On 8 May 1790 Talleyrand's proposal in the Assemblée that the <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> be defined at 45°N [...] "or whatever latitude might be preferred" [...] won the support of all parties concerned. On 13 July 1790, Jefferson presented a document Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States to the U.S. Congress in which he advocated a decimal system in which units that used traditional names such as inches, feet, roods were related to each by the powers of ten. Again he proposed a system of weights based around the weight of a cubic unit of water and a [...] "rod pendulum" [...] rather than a [...] "bob pendulum". Riggs-Miller promoted Talleyrand's proposal in the British House of Commons.|$|E

2500|$|Northrop Grumman could base {{production}} in Florida if {{they won the}} contract, which would provide tax credits, while California passed a bill offering tax credits to the manufacturer if they build it in their state, which would mainly benefit the Boeing–Lockheed Martin team. On 14 August 2014, the California legislature passed a measure to apply tax benefits equally to prime and subcontractors. [...] The previous measure only applied to subcontractors, meaning Lockheed Martin {{as part of the}} Boeing–Lockheed Martin team, placing Northrop Grumman at a near half-billion-dollar disadvantage in the bidding; the <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> levels the tax benefit field by also applying them to prime contractors, as Northrop Grumman has no subcontractor and also has operations in Palmdale.|$|E
2500|$|Forrest {{declared}} that the NDAA cannot be used to hold people in indefinite military detention on suspicion of having [...] "substantially supported" [...] al-Qaeda or its allies. [...] "The law of war has never been, and should not be, part of the domestic laws in the United States," [...] she wrote. [...] "The law of war is vague by necessity [...] it needs flexibility. It is therefore ill-suited to domestic application {{and it would be}} ill-advised to make it a part of domestic law." [...] Forrest also argued that in passing the law, Congress had dramatically expanded the categories of people that can be detained. The U.S. government had argued that the NDAA was a reassertion of powers provided by Congress in the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, which targeted perpetrators of the September 11 attacks and those who helped them. Judge Forrest said the <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> was broader, because it covered people beyond those connected to the 9/11 attacks.|$|E
2500|$|For {{members of}} The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, fasting is total {{abstinence}} from {{food and drink}} accompanied by prayer.

The money saved by not having to purchase and prepare meals is donated to the church as a fast offering, which is then used to help people in need.
