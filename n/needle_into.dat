5|$|CSF can {{be tested}} for the {{diagnosis}} {{of a variety of}} neurological diseases, usually obtained by a procedure called lumbar puncture. Lumbar puncture is carried out under sterile conditions by inserting a <b>needle</b> <b>into</b> the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. CSF is extracted through the needle, and tested. About one third of people experience a headache after lumbar puncture, and pain or discomfort at the needle entry site is common. Rarer complications may include bruising, meningitis or ongoing post lumbar-puncture leakage of CSF.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{thinking}} that the FBI agent {{is part of a}} government conspiracy, Crump forces Mulder at gunpoint to drive, infuriating him along the way with antisemitic slurs. Eventually, Mulder and Crump make amends and attempt to work out a solution before it is too late. Mulder explains to Crump that Scully will meet them at the Pacific Coast, the end of the highway. There she will insert a <b>needle</b> <b>into</b> Crump's inner ear, hopefully relieving the pressure. Unfortunately, when Scully arrives, Crump has already died.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer {{wakes up}} to find himself {{strapped}} to a table, where Ben, Tom (M. C. Gainey) and two other Others watch over him. Sawyer is gagged before inserting a large hypodermic <b>needle</b> <b>into</b> his chest. When Sawyer awakens, Ben enters, carrying a rabbit in a cage; he shakes the cage vigorously, causing the rabbit to suddenly collapse, presumably dead. Ben informs Sawyer that they fitted him, like the rabbit, with a modified pacemaker; should his heart rate reach 140, his heart would explode. Ben threatens to implant one in Kate if Sawyer should tell her of his ordeal.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the first}} {{reported}} cases of self-embedding was in 1936 when Albert Fish, a serial killer and cannibal, was caught and executed. An X-ray of his pelvis revealed about 27-29 <b>needles</b> inserted <b>into</b> his groin; the image was used as evidence at his trial. He also embedded <b>needles</b> <b>into</b> his abdomen. In 1986 Gould and Pyle described self-embedding behavior in their book Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine. They included reports of adult European women with hysteria who self-embedded by inserting <b>needles</b> <b>into</b> their body. In 2010 a study by Young et al. was one {{of the first}} to describe self-embedding in an adolescent population.|$|R

25|$|In certain circumstances, less {{invasive}} testing may {{not provide}} a certain diagnosis. Where definitive diagnosis is required, a biopsy of the kidney (renal biopsy) may be performed. This typically involves the insertion, under local anaesthetic and ultrasound or CT guidance, of a core biopsy <b>needle</b> <b>into</b> the kidney to obtain {{a small sample of}} kidney tissue. The kidney tissue is then examined under a microscope, allowing direct visualization of the changes occurring within the kidney. Additionally, the pathology may also stage a problem affecting the kidney, allowing some degree of prognostication. In some circumstances, kidney biopsy will also be used to monitor response to treatment and identify early relapse.|$|E
25|$|Suddenly, Giles Corey and Francis Nurse {{enter the}} house and inform John and Hale that both of their wives have been arrested on charges of witchcraft; Martha Corey for reading {{suspicious}} books and Rebecca Nurse on charges of sacrificing children. A posse led by clerk Ezekiel Cheever and town marshal George Herrick arrive soon afterwards and present a warrant for Elizabeth's arrest, much to Hale's surprise. Cheever picks up the poppet on Elizabeth's table and finds a needle inside. He informs John that Abigail had a pain-induced fit earlier that evening and a needle was found stuck into her stomach; Abigail claimed that Elizabeth stabbed her with the needle through witchcraft, using a poppet as a conduit. John brings Mary into the room to tell the truth; Mary asserts that she made the doll and stuck the <b>needle</b> <b>into</b> it, and that Abigail saw her do so. Cheever is unconvinced and prepares to arrest Elizabeth.|$|E

25|$|At {{a second}} interview, Mr. Cooke told Wheatstone of his {{intention}} to bring out a working telegraph, and explained his method. Wheatstone, according to his own statement, remarked to Cooke that the method would not act, and produced his own experimental telegraph. Finally, Cooke proposed that they should enter into a partnership, but Wheatstone was at first reluctant to comply. He was a well-known man of science, and had meant to publish his results without seeking to make capital of them. Cooke, on the other hand, declared that his sole object {{was to make a}} fortune from the scheme. In May they agreed to join their forces, Wheatstone contributing the scientific, and Cooke the administrative talent. The deed of partnership was dated 19 November 1837. A joint patent was taken out for their inventions, including the five-needle telegraph of Wheatstone, and an alarm worked by a relay, in which the current, by dipping a <b>needle</b> <b>into</b> mercury, completed a local circuit, and released the detent of a clockwork.|$|E
500|$|Albucasis (Abu al-Qasim Khalaf ibn al-Abbas Al-Zahrawi) used cautery for toothache, {{inserting}} a red-hot <b>needle</b> <b>into</b> the pulp of the tooth. The medieval surgeon Guy de Chauliac used a camphor, sulfur, myrrh, and asafetida mixture to fill teeth and cure toothworm and toothache. French anatomist Ambroise Paré recommended: [...] "Toothache is, of all others, the most atrocious pain that can torment a man, being followed by death. Erosion (i.e. dental decay) {{is the effect}} of an acute and acrid humour. To combat this, one must recourse to cauterization ... by means of cauterization ... one burns the nerve, thus rendering it incapable of again feeling or causing pain." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{paramedic}} tried inserting an intravenous <b>needle</b> <b>into</b> Selena, but {{her veins}} had collapsed {{because of the}} massive blood loss and low (or no) blood pressure, making the insertion extremely difficult. Local police closed off Navigation Boulevard. When paramedics delivered Selena to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital at 12:00p.m. (CST), her pupils were fixed and dilated, {{there was no evidence}} of neurological function, and she had no vital signs. Doctors were able to establish an [...] "erratic heartbeat" [...] long enough to transfer her to the trauma room. Doctors began blood transfusions in an attempt to re-establish blood circulation after opening Selena's chest and finding massive internal bleeding. Selena's right lung was damaged, her collarbone was shattered, and her veins were emptied of blood. Doctors widened her chest opening, administered drugs into her heart, and applied pressure to her wounds. Dr. Louis Elkins said a [...] "pencil-size artery leading from the heart had been cut in two by the hollow-point bullet" [...] and that six units of blood from the transfusion had spilled out from her circulatory system. After 50 minutes the doctors realized the damage was irreparable. Selena Quintanilla-Pérez was pronounced dead at 1:05p.m. (CST) from blood loss and cardiac arrest.|$|E
