Although a 2009 study found <b>no</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> difference in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when both types of vehicles were travelling in a straight line, it found a doubling of hybrid vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.|$|E

Owners of factory farms are advised to use buildings with an east–west (as opposed to north–south) orientation to house their livestock, because an east–west orientation generally means thicker walls on the east and west to accommodate the sun's acute angle and intense glare during late afternoon.

5|$|Increasing {{temperatures}} tend {{to increase}} evaporation {{which can lead}} to more precipitation. Precipitation generally increased over land north of 30°N from 1900 through 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s. Globally there has been <b>no</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> overall trend in precipitation over the past century, although trends have varied widely by region and over time. Eastern portions of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and central Asia have become wetter. The Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia have become drier. There has been {{an increase in the number}} of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts—especially in the tropics and subtropics. Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid- and high-latitude waters (implying more precipitation), along with increased salinity in lower latitudes (implying less precipitation and/or more evaporation). Over the contiguous United States, total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6.1percent since 1900, with the greatest increases within the East North Central climate region (11.6 percent per century) and the South (11.1percent). Hawaii was the only region to show a decrease (−9.25percent).|$|E

40|$|The Financial Accounting Standards Board is {{a private}} sector rule making body. Congressional {{inquiries}} have questioned whether the setting of accountin standards should remain in the private sector. Congressional critics have charged that the FASB has been captured by special interests and recommended that a governmental agency assume responsibility for standard setting. Specifically, critics charge that large corporations capture the Big Eight accounting firms who, in turn, have captured the FASB. Previous capture studies {{have concluded that the}} standard setting process is pluralistic and that the FASB has not been captured. The studies have focused on the influence of the Big Eight to determine if the FASB has been captured. They assume if standards do not reflect the expressed preferences of the Big Eight, then Congressional criticisms are invalid. The studies also assume a unidirectional influence between participants in the process and have ignored the intensity of preferences of the respondents. The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide a theoretical framework to specify selection of standards that would be expected to be subject to capture. This framework also recognizes the duo-directional nature of influence. The allegations of capture were tested using the standards selected in accordance with the theoretical framework. The following hypotheses were tested. HO_ 1 There is <b>no</b> positive <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> relationship between clients' preferences and an accounting firm's support for an outcome. HO_ 2 There is <b>no</b> positive <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> relationship between the preferences of large corporations and standards enacted by the FASB. HO_ 3 There is <b>no</b> positive <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> relationship between the preferences of the Big Eight firms and the standards enacted by the FASB.
