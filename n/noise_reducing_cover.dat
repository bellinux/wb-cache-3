40|$|AbstractTraffic {{noise is}} one of the main {{problems}} cities have to deal with. Therefore <b>noise</b> <b>reducing</b> measures have been carried out. In order to choose suitable measures it is important to know about their effects. The normal way of evaluating these measures in Germany is to focus on the reduction of sound level. But noise, defined as a sound which is perceived as nuisance cannot be measured just by these numbers. It is an individual perception and therefore varies from person to person. Moreover, depending on the type of measure, there are side effects which have an influence e. g. on accessibility (barriers) or the living environment (green), which in turn affects people's annoyance. Therefore the Ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Agriculture, Nature Conservation and Consumer Protection of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia funded a study carried out by the Institute for Urban and Transport Planning. Main part of this study was a survey performed in four German cities where the following five measures had been implemented over the last years: <b>noise</b> <b>reducing</b> asphalt, grass <b>covered</b> tramways, noise barriers, soundproof windows and night driving bans for lorries. The aim of this research was to “measure” the subjective effect of <b>noise</b> <b>reducing</b> measures on residents. The results show that residents feel negatively affected by traffic noise in different ways, e. g. that <b>noise</b> <b>reduces</b> their living quality and causes sleep problems or makes it necessary to keep the windows shut. The main health problems which were reported are nervousness, sleep and hearing problems. The longer residents live close to traffic noise, the higher is the rate of noise induced health problems. After implementation of the measures almost all of the residents experienced an improvement of their living situation. The rate of highly annoyed people was reduced by 8, 3 % to 22, 9 %...|$|R

In the summer/autumn 2014 six full scale test sections were constructed, with different material composition or construction technique. The {{different versions of}} the PERS are either made as factory produced slabs or as on site constructed road pavements. Test slabs have been produced in moulds at the test sites during construction. The test slabs are produced in order to compare material and construction depending parameters, other than the noise levels from the different surfaces. The laboratory tests performed at the test slabs are: acoustical absorption measured in an impedance tube to describe the acoustic performance of the materials; permeability by Beckers tube method and built in air void by thin-and-plane section analysis, to describe the open structure of the surfaces; mechanical impedance is measured to describe the dynamic stiffness of the elastic material; surface texture is measured to describe the surface which is met by car tyres. On the background of all these measurements the test surfaces are compared, in order to give an evaluation of the <b>noise</b> <b>reducing</b> potential of the tested test slabs. The <b>noise</b> <b>reducing</b> potentials from the tests slabs are compared to CPX measurements at the full scale test sections, whereby the most dominating <b>noise</b> <b>reducing</b> properties of the surfaces are identified...|$|R

The technical result, achieved through the using of the developed <b>noise</b> <b>reducing</b> devices is to get rid of “expressed failures” in the frequency characteristics of typical sound-insulating linings constructions due to the resonant excitation of the lower (transversal, longitudinal) acoustic eigenmodes of air cavities formed by the front panels of sound-insulating linings with oppositely placed wall (ceiling) guards technical premises. For this purpose, the relevant quarter and half-wave design of acoustic resonators and/or sound-absorbing groups preformed separate modules, using crushed fragmented sound absorbers. These constructions are arranged at the appropriate spatial zones of air cavities of sound-insulating linings, where sound pressure antinodes of the lowest resonant acoustic eigenmodes are localized. This allows you to improve the technical, cost and environmental properties of used <b>noise</b> <b>reducing</b> devices...|$|R
50|$|The TriPort {{speakers}} {{were introduced}} {{with the release}} of the Aviation X headsets. With their introduction not only was the sound quality improved over its predecessor, but due to its design the weight of the headphones was reduced. The TriPort speakers leave more space inside the ear cups for passive attenuation and allows for reduced headband force. This is mainly since the porting technology diminished the need for more passive <b>noise</b> <b>reducing</b> techniques such as clamping force and extra padding. But these headphones do have more passive noise reduction than the QC2’s giving them better <b>noise</b> <b>reducing</b> abilities with the same active noise reduction technology.|$|R

The data collection comprised a variety of potentially exposure modifying factors, including type of housing, location of rooms, window opening habits, use of <b>noise</b> <b>reducing</b> remedies, shielding due to obstacles and lengths of exposure. The quantitative role of these factors on the relationship between noise and hypertension is explored (interaction terms, stratified analyses).

A first task was {{a state of the}} art of existing methods followed by choices of best solutions for holistic optimizations of complex-shape noise barriers. Results of application to extrinsic performance optimizations are then presented taken into account acoustical, economical and environmental parameters in a multiple-objectives approach. The variety of studied noise barriers ranges from straight and flat, to strongly non flat or capped, with a total number of nine <b>noise</b> <b>reducing</b> device families to optimize. Acoustical performances are obtained from numerical calculations using the 2 D-BEM (Boundary Element Method) and applied to a set of realistic road and rail configurations. The economical performance is calculated through the construction, maintenance and demolition costs when four environmental performance indicators are considered, based on a life-cycle assessment analysis. All performances are expressed as a gain relative to a reference straight concrete barrier. It is shown that the optimization procedure allows one to obtain a wide variety of optimized <b>noise</b> <b>reducing</b> devices, and hence provides a helpful design tool able to focus on specific acoustical and non-acoustical parameters...|$|R

Road traffic noise abatement and mitigation is a huge challenge for NRAs, which, in the context of decreasing budgets, has not only to maintain sufficient level of their road networks, but also to meet the environmental requirements and society needs.

40|$|International audienceThe work {{presented}} in this paper is part of the QUIESST European project, in which one of the objective is to perform multi-objective holistic optimisations of <b>noise</b> <b>reducing</b> devices. We present here optimisation results concerning the extrinsic performances of noise barriers. The performances under interest are acoustical, economical and environmental. The variety of noise barriers considered is very wide, ranging from straight and flat barriers, to rough or capped barriers. A total number of nine <b>noise</b> <b>reducing</b> device families are optimised. Acoustical performances are obtained from numerical calculations: the Boundary Element Method (in 2 D) is used to obtain relative sound pressure levels at a set of receivers in different situations. Theses situations include road and rail sources; rural and urban cases; flat, embanked and depressed topographies. The economical performance is calculated according to the maintenance cost of the different materials in use in the barrier. Four environmental performances indicators are considered; their calculation is based on a life-cycle assessment analysis. All performances are expressed as a gain (or loss) relative to a reference screen. It is shown that the optimisation procedure allows one to obtain a wide variety of optimised <b>noise</b> <b>reducing</b> devices, and hence provides a helpful design tool by allowing one to focus on specific parameters...|$|R
