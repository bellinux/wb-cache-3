5|$|An early {{plan for}} STS-8, {{released}} in April 1982, had scheduled it for July 1983. It {{was expected to}} be a three-day mission with four crew members, and would launch INSAT-1-B, an Indian satellite, and TDRS-B, a NASA communications relay satellite. However, following problems with the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) used to deploy TDRS-A on the STS-6 mission, it was announced in May 1983 that the TDRS was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> flown. It was replaced in the manifest by the Payload Flight Test Article. After re-development of the IUS, TDRS-B was eventually re-manifested for the STS-51-L mission, and was lost along with the Space Shuttle Challenger and its crew when the launch failed in January 1986.|$|E
5|$|Bok began {{a ten-year}} period of slavery {{at the hands}} of Giemma and his son Hamid. He was forced to tend the family's herds of livestock. He had to take them to {{pastures}} in the area and to local watering holes, where he saw other Dinka boys who were also forced to tend herds of livestock. He began to suspect that his life was going to change forever and that his father was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to save him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.|$|E
5|$|He inaugurated {{his career}} as a {{legislator}} under Prince Ghica. On December 22, 1855, legislation he drafted with Petre Mavrogheni regarding the abolition of slavery was passed by the Boyar Divan. This involved the freeing of privately owned Roma slaves, as those owned by the state had been set free by Prince Sturdza in January 1844. Kogălniceanu claimed to have personally inspired the measure. Ghica was prompted to complete the process of liberation by the fate of Dincă, an educated Roma cook who had murdered his French wife and then killed himself after being made aware that he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> set free by his Cantacuzino masters.|$|E

5|$|Northern Laos, however, was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a {{priority}} for the Americans. It was decided at the Honolulu Executive Conference of April 1965 that U.S. aircraft {{could be used for}} interdiction in Laos only after close air support needs were met in South Vietnam. General Westmoreland was also granted veto power over bombing, interdiction, and reconnaissance programs outside territorial South Vietnam. That decision placed Barrel Roll behind South Vietnam, Rolling Thunder, and Steel Tiger in order of precedence. Only an estimated two percent of the total U.S. aerial effort in Southeast Asia was going to be utilized in northern Laos.|$|E
5|$|Nri's hegemony {{over much}} of Igboland lasted from the reigns of the fourth eze Nri {{to that of the}} ninth. After that, {{patterns}} of conflict emerged that existed from the tenth to the fourteenth reigns, which probably reflected the monetary importance of the slave trade. Outside-world influence was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> halted by native religious doctrine {{in the face of the}} slave trade's economic opportunities. Nri hegemony declined after the start of the 18th century. Still, it survived in a much-reduced, and weakened form until 1911. In 1911, British troops forced the reigning eze Nri to renounce the ritual power of the religion known as the ìkénga, ending the kingdom of Nri as a political power.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{travelled}} {{thousands of}} miles to arrive in India. They studied Indian geography and mastered local languages {{to deal with the}} Indians. At the time, they were technologically advanced, with superior equipment in several critical areas to that available locally. Chhabra hypothesizes that even if the British technical superiority were discounted, they would have won the war because of the discipline and organization in their ranks. After the First Anglo-Maratha war, Warren Hastings declared in 1783 that the peace established with the Marathas was on such a firm ground that it was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shaken for years to come.|$|E

5|$|To {{implement}} {{the transformation of}} the creature based on its alignment, Alex Evans developed an exporter program to export 3D Studio Max's models and animations, and Roberts created one to import them and apply them to the lion. Each version of the creature was then loaded, and interpolation code was written, as well as a blended animation between two similar ones. The system has a two-way blend: one for the alignment, and the other for how fat the creature is. As there was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> many creatures on one map, the team were able to use CPU resources to run many animations simultaneously on a single creature.|$|E
5|$|After {{her return}} to London in early 1937, {{recognising}} that she was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a success on the stage David abandoned thoughts of a theatrical career. Later in the year she took a post as a junior assistant at the fashion house of Worth, where smart young women from upper class backgrounds were sought after as recruits. She found the subservience of retail work irksome, and resigned in early 1938. Over {{the next few months}} she spent time holidaying in the south of France and on Corsica, where she was greatly taken with the outgoing nature of the people she stayed with and the simple excellence of their food. After returning to London, and disenchanted with life there, she joined Cowan in buying a boat, just big enough to suffice, with the intention of sailing it to Greece. They crossed the Channel in July 1939 and navigated the boat through the canal system of France to the Mediterranean coast.|$|E
5|$|Barkley's distant cousin, Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson II (grandson {{of former}} vice {{president}} Adlai Stevenson I), was considered his primary competition for the nomination, but had not committed before the convention. Richard Russell, Jr. and Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver were also interested in the nomination. Kentucky's delegation to the 1952 Democratic National Convention announced that they would support Barkley, and Truman encouraged Missouri's delegates to do so. Democratic National Committee chairman Frank E. McKinney, former chairman James Farley, and Senate Secretary Leslie Biffle also supported him. Two weeks before the convention, Stevenson advisor Jacob Arvey told Barkley that Stevenson was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nominated and favored nominating Barkley. Barkley's advisors believed that Kefauver and Russell would knock each other out of the early balloting, allowing Barkley to capture the nomination.|$|E

I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and {{people have the right to}} defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E
5|$|In {{denial about}} the dire situation, Hitler placed his hopes on the units {{commanded}} by Waffen-SS General Felix Steiner, the Armeeabteilung Steiner ("Army Detachment Steiner"). On 21 April, Hitler ordered Steiner {{to attack the}} northern flank of the encircling Soviet salient and ordered the German Ninth Army, south-east of Berlin, to attack northward in a pincer attack. By that evening, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of Berlin. At his afternoon situation conference on 22 April, Hitler was told Steiner's forces had not moved. Hitler fell into a tearful rage when he realised that the attack was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carried out. He openly declared {{for the first time}} the war was lost—and blamed his generals. He announced he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Diarra was heavily linked with a move to the champions Marseille. On 14 July, Marseille manager Didier Deschamps {{confirmed}} that the club was negotiating with both Diarra and Bordeaux for a transfer. A week later, Bordeaux president Triaud stated that Marseille had failed to meet the player's €7.75million release clause and that Diarra was likely <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> leaving the club. Despite Marseille remaining hopeful a deal could go through, on 30 July, a deal was declared dead. Diarra later stated that he was happy to remain at Bordeaux and see out the rest of his contract. The defensive midfielder opened the new campaign scoring two goals in the first six matches of the season in wins over Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon.|$|E

5|$|After {{the first}} year of development, Gas Powered Games found that they were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to finish the game within the planned two years; not only was the {{seamless}} world without loading screens harder to create than they had thought, but, according to lead developer Bartosz Kijanka, they had been overambitious in choosing how many innovative features they could put into the game's custom engine, such as the wide range through which the virtual camera system could zoom in and out. Other features supported and later dropped included allowing up to ten characters at once—and therefore maintaining up to ten areas of the single-player world—instead of the final maximum of eight, and a weather system that included wind blowing projectiles off course. According to Kijanka, the developers also {{spent a lot of time}} changing technologies mid-development, such as building a custom animation editor before moving to a licensed one, and starting with the OpenGL graphics library only to switch to Direct3D. As a result, the team was required to work 12–14 hour days and weekends for most of the development time in order to complete the game within four years. In a 2011 interview, Taylor stated that in retrospect the final cost in development time of the seamless world may have been too high, and also that the team tried to make too large of a game for their budget; he believed that a game with closer to 35 hours of playtime instead of 70 would have been a better and more polished experience given their constraints.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Stanković {{assured the}} British naval attaché that Yugoslav naval policy {{was focused on}} the defence of her coastline, but he also opined that this task would require {{significant}} expansion of the navy, including the acquisition of six cruisers and five more flotilla leaders similar to Dubrovnik. In the same year, Dubrovnik sailed to the Black Sea then visited several ports in the Mediterranean with King Alexander and Queen Marie aboard. During 1932, the Maritime Air Force had bases at Divulje and Đenovići, with two bomber squadrons and one reconnaissance squadron at each base, each squadron consisting of 12 aircraft. In 1934, the British naval attaché reported that the French had significant influence on Yugoslav naval policy. In the same year, the KJRM comprised 517 officers and 6,461 men, and Stanković retired and was replaced by Rear-Admiral M.L. Polić. In October, Hrabri and Smeli conducted visits to various Mediterranean ports. Despite the fact that a half-flotilla of large destroyers was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built, the idea that Dubrovnik might operate with a number of smaller destroyers persisted. In 1934, the KJRM decided to acquire three such destroyers to operate in a division led by Dubrovnik. In August 1935, Dubrovnik visited Corfu and Bizerte, the seaplane carrier Zmaj along with three Galeb-class mine tenders also visited Corfu, and Hrabri and Osvetnik visited Malta.|$|E

5|$|In {{the initial}} {{plans for the}} series, Jack {{was going to die}} midway through the first episode. The role of Jack was {{originally}} offered to Michael Keaton, but when the producers quickly changed their minds about Jack's death, making him the leader, Keaton gave up the job. After Matthew Fox's casting as Jack, the character was established as a leader, and the airplane pilot was introduced to take Jack's place as The Monster's first victim. The pilot wound up being played by Greg Grunberg, a childhood friend of Abrams who the producer brings into most of his projects. Around seventy-five women of different shapes, sizes, ethnicities and ages auditioned to be Kate. In the initial plans, Kate would emerge as the leader after Jack died. She was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a fugitive, instead her husband {{was going to go to}} the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid air, and she would remain adamant on the Island that he was alive. This ended up being used for Rose's (L. Scott Caldwell) character instead. The producers were impressed with Canadian Evangeline Lilly's audition for Kate, as she displayed the confidence with vulnerability that they were looking for. As this was Lilly's first role, she had difficulty obtaining a visa to work in America. She was supposed to start on the first day of filming, but the schedule was rearranged to give her more time, and in the meantime, the producers began auditioning again in case the visa did not come through. However, during one of the auditions, they got an email confirming that she had obtained her visa and could start work on the show.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{is forced}} to choose between Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and a new man, Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy). Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) set up Kelly and Ravi, CeCe's pediatrician, in hopes of Kelly finally moving on from Ryan. Ryan makes several {{attempts}} to get back with Kelly, though everyone finds the attempts pathetic because he can not even say he truly loves her and wants to be with her always (he keeps qualifying all of his feelings for her) and even admits he would prefer she not be with anyone else if she is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with him. Pam eventually says that he is not a nice person, and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) says he is not boyfriend material. Ryan tells the office he has a love poem for her, which Kelly has no interest in reading. As the staff are heading outside the building to go home, they see Ryan sitting on a steed professing his love (again, in insultingly hedging terms) to Kelly. She responds by saying she is in love with Ravi and hopes to stay friends with Ryan. They hug goodbye, which turns into a make-out session. The episode closes with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam finding and reading Ryan's love poem. Initially scoffing, they are both noticeably moved by it. Tearing up, Jim informs the camera crew that Ryan can never know of the incident.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{developers}} planned to only upgrade the graphics and tweak the gameplay. However, as development was {{getting closer to}} completion, Capcom started making more substantial changes in the game. For example, the inventory was expanded so that players could carry a standard item like Jill's lock picking, while defense items, which were initially <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> separated from the main inventory, were introduced to make the game a bit easier than the original Resident Evil. The developers originally planned to make all enemies invisible but the idea was ultimately discarded {{because it would have}} made the remake very different from the original game. However, they designed the zombies so that they could come back to life {{a certain amount of time}} after they are killed. The developers also added new areas for the player to explore, changed most of the puzzle designs, and included a new control scheme called Type C where players move their characters by pressing the R button of the GameCube controller and steer them with the analog stick. Another addition is the subplot involving the character Lisa Trevor, which was cut from the original game. Instead of using adjectives to describe difficulty levels, Mikami deliberately decided to have unique questions so that the player would pick the hard one.|$|E
