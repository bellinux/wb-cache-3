This paper regionalizes south-western Ontario by synthesizing {{the characteristics of}} homogeneous and <b>nodal</b> <b>regions.</b> The regions so established are considered {{in light of their}} possible application to regional government. The techniques used in the paper recognize regionalization in terms of systems analysis, such that there are places, attributes of these places and interactions between the places. Data are collected on separate matrices for the attributes of the places and for the interactions, and are referred to as structural data and behavioral data respectively. Through manipulation of the data matrices, separate measures of similarity between places are found for structure and for behavior. The two measures are combined to form a single matrix which indicates the similarity between places in terms of both structure and behavior. The places that are most similar and also adjacent are grouped to form regions. For comparison purposes regions are also formed from the structural and behavioral matrices which are homogeneous and <b>nodal</b> <b>regions</b> respectively. The synthesized regions would appear to represent adequately the syntheses of the characteristics of homogeneous <b>regions</b> and <b>nodal</b> <b>regions,</b> but their application to regional government is limited.

40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} {{acceptance of the}} relevance of the nodes of one‐body electronic wave functions (atomic or molecular orbitals) in determining chemical properties, relatively {{little is known about the}} corresponding nodes of many‐body wave functions. As an alternative to mapping the nodal surfaces present in the ground states of many‐electron systems, we have focused instead on the structural domains implied by these surfaces. In the spirit of Monte Carlo techniques, the nodal hypervolumes of a series of atomic N‐body Hartree–Fock level electronic wave functions have been mapped using a random‐walk simulation in 3 N dimensional configuration space. The basic structural elements of the domain of atomic or molecular wave functions are identified as <b>nodal</b> <b>regions</b> (continuous volumes of the same sign) and permutational cells (identical building blocks). Our algorithm determines both the relationships among <b>nodal</b> <b>regions</b> or cells (topology) as well as the geometric properties within each structural domain.

40|$|The {{recently}} discovered {{a direct link}} between the sharp peak in the electron quasiparticle scattering rate of cuprate superconductors and the well-known peak-dip-hump structure in the electron quasiparticle excitation spectrum is calling for an explanation. Within {{the framework of the}} kinetic-energy driven superconducting mechanism, the complicated line shape in the electron quasiparticle excitation spectrum of cuprate superconductors is investigated. It is shown that the interaction between electrons by the exchange of spin excitations generates a notable peak structure in the electron quasiparticle scattering rate around the antinodal and <b>nodal</b> <b>regions,</b> however, this peak structure disappears at the hot spots, which leads to that the striking peak-dip-hump structure is developed around the antinodal and <b>nodal</b> <b>regions,</b> and then it vanishes at the hot spots.

Next we consider the recently proposed model of the so-called Dynes superconductors, wherein the two lifetimes measure the strengths of pair-conserving and pair-breaking processes. We demonstrate that the model of the Dynes superconductors is fully consistent with known exact results and we study in detail the resulting spectral functions.

Ann Arbor stage and individual <b>nodal</b> and extranodal <b>regions</b> were assessed. Weighted ?? (??w) and intraclass correlation coefficient were used to compare ratings.

50|$|The first event {{appears to}} be the {{accumulation}} of cell adhesion molecules such as NF186 or NrCAM. The intra-cellular regions of these cell-adhesion molecules interact with ankyrin G, which serves as an anchor for sodium channels. At the same time, the periaxonal extension of the glial cell wraps around the axon, giving rise to the paranodal regions. This movement along the axon contributes significantly to the overall formation of the nodes of Ranvier by permitting heminodes formed at the edges of neighboring glial cells to fuse into complete nodes. Septate-like junctions form at the paranodes with the enrichment of NF155 in glial paranodal loops. Immediately following the early differentiation of the <b>nodal</b> and paranodal <b>regions,</b> potassium channels, Caspr2 and TAG1 accumulate in the juxta-paranodal regions. This accumulation coincides directly with the formation of compact myelin. In mature <b>nodal</b> <b>regions,</b> interactions with the intracellular proteins appear vital for the stability of all <b>nodal</b> <b>regions.</b> In the CNS, oligodendrocytes do not possess microvilli, but appear capable to initiate the clustering of some axonal proteins through secreted factors.

We analyze the <b>nodal</b> <b>regions</b> for a class of solutions such that the nodal set consists of regular arcs, connecting the singular points with the boundary. In case of one magnetic pole, which is free {{to move in the}} domain, the nodal lines may cluster dissecting the domain in three parts. Our main result states that the magnetic energy is critical (with respect to the magnetic pole) if and only if such a configuration occurs. Moreover the <b>nodal</b> <b>regions</b> form a minimal 3 -partition of the domain (with respect to the real energy associated to the equation), the configuration is unique and depends continuously on the data. The analysis performed is related to the notion of spectral minimal partition introduced in [20].

40|$|In {{contrast}} to a complex feature of antinodal state, suffering from competing order(s), the "pure" pairing gap of cuprates is detected in the <b>nodal</b> <b>region,</b> which therefore holds {{the key to the}} superconducting mechanism. The pairing gap has been viewed to be rather conventional, closing at the superconducting transition temperature (Tc). However, the density of states contributed from the <b>nodal</b> <b>region</b> was claimed to have a gap-like structure even above Tc. Here we present a missing evidence for a single-particle gap near the node signifying the realization of a phase incoherent d-wave superconductivity above Tc in the optimally doped Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 +d. We find that the pair formation is formulated by momentum-independent temperature evolutions of three parameters: a BCS-type energy gap (Delta), a single particle scattering rate (Gamma_single) and a pair breaking rate (Gamma_pair). The superconductivity occurs when the Gamma_pair value is suppressed smaller than Gamma_single on cooling, and the magnitude of Tc in cuprates is governed by a condition of Gamma_single(Tc) =Gamma_pair(Tc) ...|$|E
40|$|We studied underdoped high T_c superconductors using a spinon-dopon {{approach}} (or doped-carrier approach) to t-t'-t"-J model, where spinon carries {{spin and}} dopon carries both spin and charge. In this approach, {{the mixing of}} spinon and dopon describes superconductivity. We found that a nonuniform mixing in k-space is most effective in lowering the t' and t" hopping energy. We showed that at mean-field level, the mixing is proportional to quasiparticle spectral weight Z_-. We also found a simple monte-carlo algorithm to calculate Z_- from the projected spinon-dopon wavefunction, which confirms the mean-field result. Thus the non-uniform mixing caused by t' and t" explains the different electron spectral weights near the nodal and anti-nodal points (i. e. the dichotomy) observed in underdoped high T_c superconductors. For hole-doped sample, we found that Z is enhanced in the <b>nodal</b> <b>region</b> and suppressed in the anti-nodal region. For electron doped sample, the same approach leads to a suppressed Z in the <b>nodal</b> <b>region</b> and enhanced in the anti-nodal region, in agreement with experimental observations.

No consensus on proper selection and delineation of subclinical lymph nodal areas in adjuvant or definitive radiation therapy has been suggested either conclusively or proposed for further investigation. This analysis aims to study the pattern of lymph node metastasis through a pooled analysis of published results after radical tumor and lymph nodal resection with histological study in pancreatic cancer. Methods Literature search using electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CANCERLIT from January 1970 to June 2009 was performed, supplemented by review of references. Eighteen original researches {{and a total of}} 5954 pancreatic cancer patients underwent radical surgical resection were included in this analysis. The probability of metastasis in regional lymph nodal stations (using Japan Pancreas Society [JPS] Classification) was calculated and analyzed based on the location and other characteristics of the primary disease.

Methods Thirty-nine patients with medically inoperable T 1 – 4 N 0 M 0 thoracic ESCC were treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation (3 DCRT) with involved-field radiation (IFI). The conformal clinical target volume (CTV) was re-created using a 3 -cm margin in the proximal and distal direction beyond the barium esophagogram, endoscopic examination and CT scan defined the gross tumor volume (GTV) and a 0. 5 -cm margin in the lateral and anteroposterior directions of the CT scan-defined GTV. The PTV encompassed 1 -cm proximal and distal margins and 0. 5 -cm radial margin based on the CTV. <b>Nodal</b> <b>regions</b> were delineated using the Japanese Society for Esophageal Diseases (JSED) guidelines and an EORTC-ROG expert opinion. The equivalent uniform dose (EUD) and other dosimetric parameters were calculated for each <b>nodal</b> station. <b>Nodal</b> <b>regions</b> with a metastasis rate greater than 5 % were considered a high-risk lymph node subgroup.

40|$|Central {{issues in}} the {{electronic}} structure of underdoped cuprate superconductors are to clarify {{the shape of the}} Fermi surfaces and the origin of a pseudogap. Based on the model proposed by Kamimura and Suwa which bears important characteristics born from the interplay of Jahn-Teller Physics and Mott Physics, we show that the feature of Fermi surfaces is the Fermi pockets constructed by doped holes under the coexistence of a metallic state and of the local antiferromagnetic order. Below T_ c the holes on Fermi pockets form Cooper pairs with d-wave symmetry in the <b>nodal</b> <b>region.</b> In the antinodal region all the states below the Fermi level are occupied by electrons so that there is no gap, not even pseudo both below and above T_ c.
