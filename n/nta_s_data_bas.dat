40|$|The {{question}} whether real money causes real output {{appears to be}} important for many economists working {{in the area of}} macroeconomics and, has been subjected to a variety of modern econometric techniques, producing conflicting results. One often applied method to investigate the empirical relationship between money and real activity is Granger causality analysis [Granger (1969) ]. Using this approach, the causality question can be sharply posed as whether past values of money help to predict current values of output. This concept, however, should be clearly distinguished from any richer philosophical notion of causality [cf. Holland (1986) ]. Present paper examines the relationship between money (both M 1 and M 2) and income (Real GDP) for 15 developing countries using a newly developed heterogeneous dynamic panel data approach. 1 Sims (1972) postulated “the hypothesis that causality is unidirectional from money to income agrees with the post war U. <b>S.</b> <b>data,</b> whereas the hypothesis that causality is unidirectional from income to money is rejected”. Since then a voluminous literature has emerged testing the direction of causality. 2 Some studies have tested the relationship between these variables and the direction of causality for a particular country using time series techniques [e. g., Hsiao (1979) for Canada, Stock and Watson (1989) for U. <b>S.</b> <b>data,</b> Friedman and Kuttner (1992, 1993) for U. <b>S.</b> <b>data,</b> Thoma (1994) for U. <b>S.</b> <b>data,</b> Christiana and Ljungquist (1988) for U. <b>S.</b> <b>data,</b> Davis and Tanner (1997) for U. <b>S.</b> <b>data.</b> ...|$|R

Few {{attempts were made to}} exploit bedding attitude (<b>BA)</b> <b>data</b> (or data on similar types of rock discontinuities) in statistical or physically based models for regional slope stability analysis. A reason for the lack of applications lays in the complexity of the bedding data, and in the difficulty in the treatment and modelling of circular information. Typically, <b>BA</b> <b>data</b> are collected as point data through field surveys, and suffer from heterogeneity in their spatial distribution. The latter problem is particularly important due to the limited possibility to collect <b>BA</b> <b>data</b> in areas of difficult access.

40|$|This paper investigates how {{concentrated}} {{ownership of}} capital influences the pricing of risky assets in a production economy. The model {{is designed to}} approximate the skewed distribution of wealth and income in U. <b>S.</b> <b>data.</b> I show that concentrated ownership significantly magnifies the equity risk premium relative to an otherwise similar representative-agent economy because the capital owners' consumption is more strongly linked to volatile dividends from equity. A temporary shock to the technology for producing new capital (an "investment shock") causes dividend growth {{to be much more}} volatile than aggregate consumption growth, as in long-run U. <b>S.</b> <b>data.</b> The investment shock can also be interpreted as a depreciation shock, or more generally, a financial friction that affects the supply of new capital. Under power utility with a risk aversion coeffecient of 3. 5, the model can roughly match the first and second moments of key asset pricing variables in long-run U. <b>S.</b> <b>data,</b> including the historical equity risk premium. About one-half of the model equity premium is attributable to the investment shock while the other half is attributable to a standard productivity shock. On the macro side, the model performs reasonably well in matching the business cycle moments of aggregate variables, including the pro-cyclical movement of capital's share of total income in U. <b>S.</b> <b>data.</b> Asset pricing, Equity premium, Term premium, Investment shocks, Real business cycles, Wealth inequality...|$|R

Phylogenetic relationships were estimated with maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony techniques {{for the new}} data and for previously published molecular data for 45 palm genera. Maximum parsi-mony analysis was also used to compare molecular and morphological data for 33 palm genera.
