5|$|This {{second vote}} was {{challenged}} {{by a local}} Gaelic Athletic Association club, Thomas Davis who wanted the vote on 13 January 2006 declared illegal thus forcing the county council to build the GAA stadium. Thomas Davis claimed that {{the capacity of the}} stadium (initially 6,000, ultimately 10,000) would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by the change, the other parties involved disputed this and argued that the capacity would be reduced. Requests {{under the freedom of information}} act to both South Dublin County Council and the Department of Sport showed that Thomas Davis had not submitted any plans showing that capacity would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry is {{opposite}} {{in principle}} to defensive mimicry, where the mimic generally benefits from being treated as harmful. The mimic may resemble its own prey, or some other organism which is beneficial {{or at least not}} harmful to the prey. The model, i.e. the organism being 'imitated', may experience increased or reduced fitness, or may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> at all by the relationship. On the other hand, the signal receiver inevitably suffers from being tricked, {{as is the case in}} most mimicry complexes.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{considerations}} {{taken into}} account when designing the building include the polycarbonate cladding, used for natural light and passive heating; and a hydronic heating and cooling system using the constant temperature of the sea water below the pontoon. As a floating structure, it will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by rises in the sea level. The gabled roof design is intended {{to fit in with}} the other buildings in Sullivans Cove including PW1, Elizabeth Street Pier and the Mac02 Cruise Terminal– which themselves are based on the historic use of the area as a freight port.|$|E

5|$|The {{confirmation}} of extraterrestrial intelligence {{could have a}} profound impact on religious doctrines, potentially causing theologians to reinterpret scriptures to accommodate the new discoveries. However, a survey of people with many different religious beliefs indicated that their faith would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence, and another study, conducted by Ted Peters of the Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary, shows that most people would not consider their religious beliefs superseded by it. Surveys of religious leaders indicate that only a small percentage are concerned that the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence might fundamentally contradict the views of the adherents of their religion. Gabriel Funes, the chief astronomer of the Vatican Observatory and a papal adviser on science, has stated that the Catholic Church would be likely to welcome extraterrestrial visitors warmly.|$|E
5|$|The {{consistent}} {{variation in}} the path of Claudette caused uncertainty over the strength and location of its final landfall. On July 13, two days prior to Claudette's eventual landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch between Brownsville and Port O'Connor, Texas. By the next day, a hurricane warning existed from Baffin Bay to High Island, Texas, while a tropical storm warning extended from High Island to Intracoastal City, Louisiana. When it became apparent that Louisiana would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> significantly by the storm, the state's tropical storm warnings were canceled. In Texas, Galveston County officials recommended evacuations for western Galveston Island and Jamaica Beach, 24hours prior to Claudette's projected landfall. The Emergency Phone Notification System notified citizens in the evening to avoid evacuating during the night. Many citizens heeded the evacuation suggestion, some of whom remembered the flooding from Tropical Storm Frances five years before.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} came at {{a delicate}} time for relations between Iran and Western nations, which were removing sanctions on Iran after its compliance with an agreement for curtailing development of its nuclear enrichment program. The agreement stipulated that once Iranian compliance with {{the terms of the}} agreement was verified, most sanctions against Iran would be lifted, including all sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council as well as nuclear-related European Union and U.S. sanctions; U.S. sanctions against Iran for terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected.</b> In mid-January 2016, most sanctions were lifted. In March, the District Court for the Southern District of New York found, by default, that Iran had provided support to certain terrorist groups and individuals responsible for the September 11 attacks and awarded $10.5billion in damages to the plaintiffs, which consisted of $3billion to reimburse insurance companies for paid claims and $7.5billion for victims and their families ($2million for pain and suffering and $6.88million in punitive damages per victim). The same judge ruled just six months earlier that there was insufficient evidence linking Saudi Arabia—which has sour relations with Iran—to the 9/11 attacks to overcome, under the terrorism exemption, Saudi Arabia's immunity under the FSIA.|$|E

25|$|Phase 5 is {{characterized}} by human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region. While most countries will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> at this stage, the declaration of Phase 5 is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and that the time to finalize the organization, communication, {{and implementation of the}} planned mitigation measures is short.|$|E
25|$|Belgian Minister of State Louis Tobback and Trends {{journalist}} Geert Noels {{blamed the}} Euro for allowing the formation talks to last this long. Since the Belgian government {{is no longer}} in charge of its own monetary policy, the value of the currency will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by this political crisis, so there is no monetary incentive to force the formation partners to find a quick solution.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{is involved}} in the production of blue colors, iridescence, most ultraviolet reflectance and in the enhancement of pigmentary colors. Structural iridescence has been reported in fossil feathers dating back 40 million years. White feathers lack pigment and scatter light diffusely; albinism in birds is caused by defective pigment production, though structural coloration will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> (as can be seen, for example, in blue-and-white budgerigars).|$|E

25|$|In 2014, Canada Post {{began to}} phase out {{door-to-door}} service in urban centres, in favour of community mailboxes—a process that was estimated to affect 32% of Canadian addresses (subdivisions built after 1985 already use community mailboxes, and customers using rural mailboxes would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected).</b> The decision {{was meant to be}} a cost-cutting measure in the face of financial losses, due primarily to the decreased use of traditional mail in favour of electronic alternatives.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these basic principles, antecedent factors also affect behavior. Behavior is punished or reinforced {{in the context of}} whatever stimuli were present just before the behavior was performed, which means that a particular behavior might <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> in every context, just because it was punished or reinforced in a particular one. A lack of praise for school-related behavior might, for instance, not decrease sports-related behavior usually reinforced by praise.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the mistake}} was {{discovered}} far too late. It was discovered when the admissions process was almost over. Since some candidates {{were unable to}} find a school for their matriculate education because they received an incorrect grade, the Education and Manpower Bureau was forced to increase the school quotas for some schools to accommodate the affected students. HKEAA chairman Irving Koo assured the students that their education would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by the error.|$|E
25|$|The burden {{voltage can be}} {{significant}} in very low-voltage circuit areas. To check for its effect on accuracy and on external circuit operation the meter can be switched to different ranges; the current reading {{should be the same}} and circuit operation should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> if burden voltage is not a problem. If this voltage is significant it can be reduced (also reducing the inherent accuracy and precision of the measurement) by using a higher current range.|$|E
25|$|On February 15, 2006, the European Parliament {{accepted}} a resolution which condemns all violence {{arising from the}} publication of the cartoons. It stated that the EU stands in solidarity with Denmark and all other countries that have been affected by the violence. Furthermore, it stated that Muslims may be offended by the cartoons and that {{they have the right to}} protest peacefully.
