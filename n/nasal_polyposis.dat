Objective: To assess the incidence of <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis,</b> the response to medical treatment, recurrence {{and the need for}} surgical intervention in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis during a three-year follow-up. Methods: Clinical symptoms (pulmonary, pancreatic insufficiency, malnutrition, nasal obstruction), two positive sweat chloride tests, and genotype findings in 23 patients with cystic fibrosis were analyzed. All patients underwent nasal endoscopy every 12 months from January 2005 to December 2007, to assess the presence and grade of Nasal Polyps. <b>Nasal</b> <b>polyposis,</b> when present, were treated with topical corticosteroids for 6 - 12 months, with progress being evaluated within the 3 years of follow-up. Results: In the first evaluation, <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis</b> was diagnosed in 30. 43 % of patients (3 bilateral and 4 unilateral), recurrent pneumonia in 82. 6 %, pancreatic insufficiency in 87 %, and malnutrition in 74 %.

Methods: A questionnaire to a random sample of 15, 000 individuals, 19 - 80 years (I). A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 68 patients, > 18 years, with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis</b> and asthma were randomised to FPND or placebo for 4 weeks prior to, and 5 weeks after FESS. For an additional 7 weeks all patients received FPND. Assessments pre- and post-FESS included; asthma symptoms, PEFR, FEV 1, nasal symptoms, PNIF, olfactory thresholds, SF- 36 (IV and V). A randomised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre study. 162 patients, > 18 years, with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis</b> were randomised to MFNS or placebo approximately 2 weeks after FESS until relapse of nasal polyps or for a maximum of 6 months. Nasal polyps were scored on a 4 -point scale for each nasal cavity (II). A study of 160 patients who had undergone FESS. Olfactory thresholds and sense of smell were measured pre-FESS and 2 weeks after surgery (III). Results: The prevalence of self-reported non-allergic nasal symptoms was 19. 3 % (95 % CI 18. 4 - 20. 2) and did not change with age. In that group the prevalence of reduced sense of smell was 25. 6 % (95 % CI 23. 3 - 28. 0) (I). Asthma symptoms decreased after FESS in both FPND and placebo groups 5 weeks after FESS (p= 0. 007), and PEFR was increased in the placebo group (p= 0. 010). All nasal symptoms decreased and PNIF and olfactory thresholds improved in both groups after FESS (p= 0. 015 0. 001). There {{were no significant differences between}} the two groups (IV). At baseline HRQoL was decreased in both Physical Component Summary, PCS, (p= 0. 049) and Mental Component Summary, MCS, (p 175 days in the MFNS group and 125 days in the placebo group (ITT, p= 0. 049) (II). Olfactory threshold increased from 0 pre-FESS to 3. 0 (p< 0. 001) 2 weeks post-FESS. Sense of smell score decreased from 3. 0 pre FESS to 1. 7 (p< 0. 001) post-FESS, i. e. improvement (III). Conclusions: Self-reported non-allergic rhinitis symptoms are highly prevalent independent of age, and reduced sense of smell is a common complaint (I). FESS, but not addition of FPND, improved asthma symptoms as well as olfaction and PEFR in patients with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis</b> and asthma (IV). HRQoL is impaired in patients with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis</b> and concomitant asthma. FESS seems to have benefits on HRQoL in these patients and FPND can be added to improve, and also to reach population levels of, HRQoL at 5 weeks post-FESS (V). Post-FESS use of MFNS 200 μg once daily increases time to relapse of polyps in patients with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis</b> (II). There are indications of a positive effect of FESS on olfaction in <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis</b> (III) ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of topical administration of corticosteroid beclomethasone dipropionate on common nasal symptoms in moderate allergic and non-allergic hyperreactive eosinophilic rhinitis, and in allergic and non-allergic hyperreactive eosinophilic rhinitis associated with bilateral moderate <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis.</b> The study was prospective and controlled. During the study 106 patients were examined, out of whom 66 were treated, while 40 had no therapy. Beclomethasone diproprionate nasal spray was administered in the daily dose of 400 çg. Patients with isolated rhinitis underwent 3 otorhinolaryngologic examinations during the six-week treatment. Patients with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis</b> underwent 4 otorhinolaryngologic examinations during six-month treatment. One-week therapy showed highly significant decrease of the average score of symptoms of isolated rhinitis in relation to basal condition. No further significant change was noted after six-week therapy. Six-week therapy of <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis</b> exerted significantly reduced score of symptoms in relation to basic condition. During further treatment no significant reduction of symptoms was noted. Follow-up period of all control subgroups showed no significant change of symptom scores. Topical therapy with beclomethasone dipropionate represented a significant medication of the first therapeutic line in moderate isolated eosinophilic rhinitis, as well as in moderate bilateral eosinophilic <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{review is}} {{addressed}} two pathophysiologic mechanisms {{implicated in the}} pathogenesis of nasal polyposis: the unique remodeling process found in nasal polyp tissue and the immune response of patients with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis</b> to Staphylococcus aureus. These two theories converge to the same direction in different aspects, including decreased extracellular matrix production, impaired T regulation and favoring of a Th 2 immune response. In patients with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis,</b> an exaggerated immune response to Staphylococcus aureus may aggravate the airway remodeling process...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Fungal {{infection}} may be {{secondary to}} <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis</b> or represent a real etiopathogenic {{factor in the}} infection itself. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness of a combined treatment with lysine acetylsalicylate (LAS) and amphotericin B in preventing recurrence in patients with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis</b> with accompanying mycotic infection in comparison with a control group with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis</b> and fungal infection who did not receive antifungal therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 115 patients with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis</b> were randomly assigned to 4 different groups and treated as follows: (1) group A, 25 patients were first surgically treated and then treated with LAS; (2) group B, 25 patients received 40 mg of triamcinolone retard intramuscularly 3 times every 10 days (total dose 120 mg) and then they were treated with LAS; (3) group C, 16 patients were surgically treated and then treated with LAS and amphotericin B; (4) group D: 23 patients were treated with a medical polypectomy and steroids (as in the group B) and then with LAS and amphotericin B. RESULTS: We found no significant differences between groups C and D, groups C and A, or groups B and D. However, the recurrence of nasal polyps in the groups treated with amphotericin B plus LAS (C and D) was significantly lower (P =. 018) than in the 2 groups treated only with LAS (A and B). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that long term topical treatment with LAS and amphotericin B may be clinically effective in the treatment of patients with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis</b> associated with fungal infection...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionNasal {{polyposis}} {{is often}} found in patients with cystic fibrosis. ObjectiveTo assess the incidence of <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis,</b> the response to medical treatment, recurrence {{and the need for}} surgical intervention in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis during a three-year follow-up. MethodsClinical symptoms (pulmonary, pancreatic insufficiency, malnutrition, nasal obstruction), two positive sweat chloride tests, and genotype findings in 23 patients with cystic fibrosis were analyzed. All patients underwent nasal endoscopy every 12 months from January 2005 to December 2007, to assess the presence and grade of Nasal Polyps. <b>Nasal</b> <b>polyposis,</b> when present, were treated with topical corticosteroids for 6 – 12 months, with progress being evaluated within the 3 years of follow-up. ResultsIn the first evaluation, <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis</b> was diagnosed in 30. 43 % of patients (3 bilateral and 4 unilateral), recurrent pneumonia in 82. 6 %, pancreatic insufficiency in 87 %, and malnutrition in 74 %. The presence of <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis</b> was not associated with chloride values in the sweat, genotype, clinical signs of severity of cystic fibrosis, or nasal symptoms. In the three-year period of follow up, 13 patients (56. 52 %) had at least one event of polyposis, with the youngest being diagnosed at 32 months of age. Only one patient underwent surgery (polypectomy), and there was one diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. ConclusionThe study showed a high incidence of <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis.</b> Monitoring through routine endoscopy in patients with cystic fibrosis, {{even in the absence of}} nasal symptoms, is highly recommended. The therapy with topical corticosteroids achieved good results. Thus, an interaction between pediatricians and otolaryngologists is necessary...|$|E

Mannose-binding lectin is an important component of innate immunity; it initiates the lectin pathway of comple-ment activation critical for innate immunity. Failure of local innate defenses may result in defective responses that lead to the persistent carriage of microorganisms or ongoing inflammation. This study investigated the role of mannose-binding lectin levels and the frequency of the 6 functional mannose-binding lectin polymorphisms in Turkish individuals with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis.</b> Study Design. A case-control study. Setting. University hospital. Subjects and Methods. Fifty-one patients with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis</b> and 53 healthy controls were enrolled. Serum mannose-binding lectin levels were obtained by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) using the mannose-binding lectin oligo-mer ELISA kit. Mannose-binding lectin 2 genotyping was performed by isolating the genomic DNA from leukocytes. Results. Mean mannose-binding lectin levels were 1693. 2 and 1887. 8 in the patient and control group, respectively. Although mannose-binding lectin levels were lower in the patient group, the difference was not statistically significant (P [...] 05). No overall association was observed between the mannose-binding lectin genotype and susceptibility to <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis</b> (95 % confidence interval = 0. 716 – 4. 389, odds ratio = 1. 773). The mutant allele frequencies of the 3 structural polymorph-isms did not differ significantly between the <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis</b> patients and the controls (P =. 659). Conclusions. Mannose-binding lectins are not involved in the pathogenesis of <b>nasal</b> <b>polyposis</b> in adult Turkish patients, but additional research is needed for further comment...|$|E
