One explanation for this finding has to do with perceived status, being publicly recognized as a pro-social individual often enhance one's self-image and desirability to be considered for inclusion in social groups. Other research has shown that merely given people the [...] "illusion" [...] that they are being observed (e.g., by hanging up posters of [...] "staring" [...] human eyes) can generate significant changes in pro-social acts such as charitable giving and less littering. Pictures of human eyes trigger an involuntary <b>neural</b> <b>gaze</b> detection mechanism, which primes people to act pro-socially.|$|E
40|$|Physiological {{studies of}} {{non-human}} primates {{have suggested that}} the direction of gaze can modulate the gain of neuronal res-ponses to visual stimuli in many cortical areas including V 1. The <b>neural</b> <b>gaze</b> modulation is suggested to subserve the conversion from gaze-independent (eye-centered) to dependent (e. g., head-centered) representations. However, it has not been established whether the gaze modulation has significant influences on human visual perception. Here we show that gaze direction modestly but significantly modulates the magnitudes of the motion aftereffect, the tilt aftereffect and the size aftereffect. These aftereffects were stronger when the adaptation and test patterns were presented in the same gaze direction, than when they were presented in different gaze directions, even though the patterns always stimulated the same retinal location. The gaze modulation effect was not statis-tically significant for the post-adaptation elevation of contrast detection thresholds. The gaze modulation of visual aftereffects provides a useful psychophysical tool to analyze human cortical processes for coordinate transformations of visual space...|$|E
40|$|Various {{reports have}} {{demonstrated}} difficulties in eye-gaze processing in older {{children and adults}} with autism. However, {{little is known about}} the neural or developmental origin of such difficulties. In the present study, we used high-density Event-Related Potentials (HD-ERPs) to record the <b>neural</b> correlates of <b>gaze</b> processing in young children with autism, and their age-matched controls. In addition, to determine normal gaze processing development we also tested a non-autism adult group. The data obtained from the children with autism resembled that previously observed in typical 4 -month old infants. In contrast, the control group showed the same pattern as typical adults. These findings suggest that the <b>neural</b> correlates of <b>gaze</b> direction processing may be delayed in young children with autism...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring gaze shifts is {{important}} for social interactions. The direction of gaze can reveal intentions and help to predict future actions. Here we examined whether behavioural and <b>neural</b> responses to <b>gaze</b> shifts were modulated by {{the social context of}} the gaze shift in two linked experiments. Two faces were presented, one gazing directly at the subject (the ‘social’ face) and one with averted gaze (the ’unsocial’ face). One face then made a gaze shift that was either towards a visible target (’correct’) or towards another location in space (’incorrect’). Both behavioural and <b>neural</b> responses to <b>gaze</b> shifts were modulated by the social context and the goal directedness of the gaze shift. Reaction times were significantly faster in response to ’correct’ and ‘social’ compared with ’incorrect’ and ’unsocial’ gaze shifts, respectively. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found significantly greater activation in the parieto-frontal attentional network, and {{in some parts of the}} posterior superior temporal sulcus, in response to ‘incorrect’ and ’unsocial’ compared with ’incorrect’ and ‘social’ gaze shifts, respectively. Conversely, we found greater activation in the medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus in response to ’correct’ and ‘social’ compared with ’incorrect’ and ’unsocial’ gaze shifts. This activity may reflect the experience of joint attention associated with these gaze shifts...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPrior {{physiological}} {{studies indicate}} that gaze direction modulates the gain of neural responses to visual stimuli. Here, we test gaze modulation in the perceptual domain using color and depth aftereffects. After confirming retinotopy of the effects, we employed a balanced alternating adaptation paradigm (adaptation alternates between opponent stimuli) to demonstrate that opposite color and depth aftereffects can co-develop at the same retinal location for different gaze directions. The results provide strong evidence for (a) gaze modulation of aftereffects, (b) generality of gaze modulation across two visual attributes, and (c) perceptual correlates of the modulation of <b>neural</b> activity by <b>gaze</b> direction...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDirect gaze is {{a salient}} nonverbal signal for social {{interest}} and {{the intention to}} communicate. In particular, the duration of another's direct gaze can modulate our perception of the social meaning of gaze cues. However, both poor eye contact and deficits in social cognitive processing of gaze are specific diagnostic features of autism. Therefore, investigating <b>neural</b> mechanisms of <b>gaze</b> may provide key insights into the neural mechanisms related to autistic symptoms. Employing {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) and a parametric design, we investigated the neural correlates of the influence of gaze direction and gaze duration on person perception in individuals with high-functioning autism (HFA) and a matched control group. For this purpose, dynamically animated faces of virtual characters, displaying averted or direct gaze of different durations (1 s, 2. 5 s and 4 s) were evaluated on a four-point likeability scale. Behavioral results revealed that HFA participants showed no significant difference in likeability ratings depending on gaze duration, while the control group rated the virtual characters as increasingly likeable with increasing gaze duration. On the <b>neural</b> level, direct <b>gaze</b> and increasing direct gaze duration recruit regions of the social neural network (SNN) in control participants, indicating the processing of social salience and a perceived communicative intent. In participants with HFA however, regions of the social neural network were more engaged by averted and decreasing amounts of <b>gaze,</b> while the <b>neural</b> response for processing direct gaze in HFA was not suggestive of any social information processing...|$|R
40|$|Humans {{are highly}} {{sensitive}} to another's gaze direction, and {{use this information}} to support a range of social cognitive functions. Here we review recent studies that have begun to delineate a <b>neural</b> system for <b>gaze</b> perception. We focus in particular {{on a set of}} core gaze processes: perceptual coding of another's eye gaze direction, which may involve anterior superior temporal sulcus (STS); gaze-cued attentional orienting, which may be mediated by lateral parietal regions; and the experience of joint attention with another individual, which recruits medial prefrontal cortex. We conclude that understanding this gaze processing system will require a combination of multivariate pattern analysis approaches to characterise the role of individual nodes as well as connectivity-based methods to study interactions at the systems level...|$|R

40|$|Gaze cuing, the {{tendency}} to shift attention in the direction other individuals are looking, is hypothesized to depend on a distinct neural module. One expectation of such a module is that information processing should be encapsulated within it. Here, we tested whether familiarity, a type of social knowledge, penetrates the <b>neural</b> circuits governing <b>gaze</b> cuing. Male and female subjects viewed {{the face of an}} adult male looking left or right and then pressed a keypad to indicate the location of a target appearing randomly left or right. Responses were faster for targets congruent with gaze direction. Moreover, gaze cuing was stronger in females than males. Contrary to the modularity hypothesis, familiarity enhanced gaze cuing, but only in females. Sex differences in the effects of familiarity on gaze cuing may reflect greater adaptive significance of social information for females than males...|$|R
40|$|A coordinated {{movement}} of the eyes and head in the head-unrestrained condition {{is often used to}} change orientation between targets. Under natural conditions, these gaze shifts are typically generated with the eyes roughly centered in the orbits. To achieve experimental control of eye and head positions, a miniature laser was mounted on the head implants of monkeys that were trained to point the head to one target and direct gaze to another before generating a head-unrestrained gaze shift to a third target (dissociation paradigm). For comparison, monkeys were also required to make gaze shifts between stimuli, without any constraints on eye and head positions (standard paradigm). Analyses indicated that movement parameters, limited to horizontal gaze shifts, were similar for both behavioral conditions. Thus, the proposed technique and behavioral paradigm, when used in conjunction with electrophysiological and pharmacological experiments, may facilitate the study of <b>neural</b> control of <b>gaze.</b> © 2001 Elsevie...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} an artificial <b>neural</b> network based <b>gaze</b> tracking system which can be customized to individual users.

40|$|The {{ability to}} adjust the {{amplitude}} of gaze shifts in response to persistent visual errors (“gaze adaptation”) has been investigated primarily by introducing visual errors {{at the end of}} saccades produced by head-restrained primates. Very {{little is known about the}} behavior and <b>neural</b> mechanisms underlying <b>gaze</b> adaptation when the head is free to move. We tested alternative hypotheses about the signals that are altered during gaze adaptation by increasing (25 ° → 50 °; “forward adaptation”) or decreasing (50 ° → 25 °; “backward adaptation”) the size of large, head-unrestrained gaze shifts. In our three rhesus monkey subjects, changes to primary gaze shift amplitude occurred regardless of the particular combinations of eye and head movements that made up the amplitude-altered gaze shifts. The relative changes to eye and head movements that occurred during adaptation could be predicted based on the magnitude of gaze adaptation and the positions of the eyes in the orbits at gaze onset. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that gaze adaptation occurs at the level of a gaze shift command and inconsistent with hypotheses based on the assumption that gaze adaptation results from alterations to eye- and/or head-specific signals...|$|R

40|$|A basic {{principle}} in visual neuroscience is the retinotopic organization of neural receptive fields. Here, we review behavioral, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging evidence for nonretinotopic processing of visual stimuli. A number of behavioral {{studies have shown}} perception depending on object or external-space coordinate systems, in addition to retinal coordinates. Both single-cell neurophysiology and neuroimaging have provided evidence for the modulation of <b>neural</b> firing by <b>gaze</b> position and processing of visual information based on craniotopic or spatiotopic coordinates. Transient remapping of the spatial and temporal properties of neurons contingent on saccadic eye movements has been demonstrated in visual cortex, as well as frontal and parietal areas involved in saliency/priority maps, and is a good candidate to mediate some of the spatial invariance demonstrated by perception. Recent studies suggest that spatiotopic selectivity depends on a low spatial resolution system of maps that operates over a longer time frame than retinotopic processing and is strongly modulated by high-level cognitive factors such as attention. The interaction of an initial and rapid retinotopic processing stage, tied to new fixations, and a longer lasting but less precise nonretinotopic level of visual representation could underlie the perception of both a detailed and a stable visual world across saccadic eye movements...|$|R
40|$|Abnormal {{eye contact}} is a core symptom of autism {{spectrum}} disorders (ASD), though little is understood of the <b>neural</b> bases of <b>gaze</b> processing in ASD. Competing hypotheses suggest {{that individuals with}} ASD avoid eye contact due to the anxiety-provoking nature of direct eye gaze or that eye-gaze cues hold less interest or significance to children with ASD. The current study {{examined the effects of}} <b>gaze</b> direction on <b>neural</b> processing of emotional faces in typically developing (TD) children and those with ASD. While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 16 high-functioning children and adolescents with ASD and 16 TD controls viewed a series of faces depicting emotional expressions with either direct or averted gaze. Children in both groups showed significant activity in visual-processing regions for both direct and averted gaze trials. However, there was a significant group by gaze interaction such that only TD children showed reliably greater activity in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex for direct versus averted gaze. The ASD group showed no difference between direct and averted gaze in response to faces conveying negative emotions. These results highlight the key role of eye gaze in signaling communicative intent and suggest altered processing of the emotional significance of direct gaze in children with ASD...|$|R

Most {{of what we}} know about the <b>neural</b> control of <b>gaze</b> comes from experi-ments in head-fixed animals, but several “head-free ” studies have suggested that fixing the head dramatically alters the apparent gaze command. We directly investigated this issue by quantitatively com-paring head-fixed and head-free gaze trajectories evoked by electri-cally stimulating 52 sites in the superior colliculus (SC) of two monkeys and 23 sites in the supplementary eye fields (SEF) of two other monkeys. We found that {{head movement}}s made a significant contribution to gaze shifts evoked from both neural structures. In the majority of the stimulated sites, average gaze amplitude was signifi-cantly larger and individual gaze trajectories were significantly less convergent in space with the head free to move. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that head-fixed stimulation only reveals the oculomotor component of the gaze shift, not the true, planned goal of the movement. One implication of this finding is that when com-paring stimulation data against popular gaze control models, freeing the head shifts the apparent coding of gaze away from a “spatial code” toward a simpler visual model in the SC and toward an eye-centered or fixed-vector model representation in the SEF...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSensorimotor adaptation, {{the ability}} to adjust motor output in {{response}} to persistent changes in sensory input, is a key function of the central nervous system. Although a great deal is known about vestibulo-ocular reflex and saccadic adaptation, relatively {{little is known about}} the behavior and <b>neural</b> mechanisms underlying <b>gaze</b> adaptation when the head is free to move. In an attempt to understand the mechanisms of gaze adaptation, and constrain hypotheses concerning the locus at which changes in gaze control may be implemented, we altered the size of large, head-unrestrained gaze shifts made to visual targets by surreptitiously moving the visual target forward (30 °→ 60 °) or backwards (60 °→ 30 °) during gaze shifts. In our 10 human subjects, after a few hundred back-step trials, gaze amplitudes were reduced by between 6 ° and 27 °. Similarly, after a few hundred forward adaptation trials, our subjects increased gaze amplitude by between 0 ° and 26 °. Changes in the amplitude of primary gaze shifts occurred regardless of the particular combinations of eye and head movements that made up the amplitude-altered gaze shifts. When gaze shifts were initiated with the eyes in systematically different positions relative to the head, the resulting changes in gaze, eye and head movement amplitudes were consistent with the hypothesis that gaze adaptation occurs at the level of a gaze shift command and not by altering separately the signals that produce eye and head movements...|$|R
40|$|Eye gaze {{plays an}} {{important}} role in social interaction. Eye gaze direction provides a cue of what may be in the other person s mind. According to recent studies in adults, the perceived gaze direction of another person influences the observer s neural affective-motivational responses of approach and avoidance. The aim of this study was to examine whether seeing direct versus averted <b>gaze</b> influences affective-motivational <b>neural</b> responses in children and whether it would make a difference to these responses if children viewed the face of a human or a dummy. Two age groups (5 - and 7 -year-olds) were compared to examine the effect of age on these neural responses. Possible differences in the amount of animistic thinking exhibited between the age groups were expected to affect the neural responses. It is a widely held view that approach-related motivation enhances relative left-sided frontal EEG activity, whereas avoidance-related motivation enhances relative right-sided frontal EEG activity. Based on earlier studies in adults, it was expected that the perceived direct gaze of a human would elicit left-sided frontal EEG asymmetry (indicative of approach-related motivation) and the perceived averted gaze of a human would elicit smaller left-sided frontal EEG asymmetry or right-sided frontal EEG asymmetry (indicative of avoidance-related motivation) in both 5 - and 7 -year-olds. Research suggests that especially young children may have difficulty distinguishing living entities from the non-living. Children may attribute human properties to inanimate agents, which is referred to as animistic thinking. In the present study, it was expected the 5 -year-olds would likely exhibit animistic thinking regarding the dummy and that the perceived gaze direction of the human and the dummy would therefore elicit similar neural responses. Studies indicate that animistic thinking decreases during the preschool years, and it was expected that only the perceived gaze direction of the human would influence the neural approach-avoidance responses in the 7 -year-olds. In the experiment, power in the alpha band from the left and right frontal channels (F 4 /F 3 and F 8 /F 7) was measured with EEG. Several alpha bands were tested in the analyses to ensure the capturing of the alpha band applicable to children (6 - 9 Hz, 6 - 12 Hz, 8 - 13 Hz). An animism questionnaire was presented to the children to examine whether animistic thinking regarding the dummy would be exhibited. Subjective ratings of valence were inquired from the children to examine how they felt when watching the stimuli. Results were contrary to expectations. The study did not provide evidence of perceived gaze direction of animate and inanimate models affecting frontal EEG asymmetry as hypothesized in children of either age group. The children in both age groups exhibited animistic thinking regarding the dummy, but there was no difference found in the amount of animistic thinking between age groups. Valence ratings indicated that watching both models and gaze directions was fairly pleasant. Many factors may have contributed to the results of this study. Studies suggest that the mental and <b>neural</b> processing of <b>gaze</b> direction develops with age. The development of these processes in the studied age groups may be at a stage where gaze direction does not yet activate the affective-motivational neural systems efficiently. It is also unclear to what extent methodological issues may have contributed to the results of this study. Longitudinal research should be executed to provide more information regarding the effect of gaze direction on frontal EEG asymmetry during development, taking contributing individual factors into account...|$|R
