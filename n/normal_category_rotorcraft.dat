40|$|Federal Aviation Administration will {{certainly}} require the Heavy Lift Rotorcraft {{to be operated}} under Category A performance and operations requirements. Because of the weight, no operation will be allowed except Category A according to FAA Part 29. 1 (c). This means that any where along the flight path, the aircraft {{must be able to}} land safely following an engine failure or continue flight. A repeatable flight profile must be developed and executed to ensure that the aircraft can be safely landed or flown away depending on its location on the flight profile. This means {{that there will be no}} Height-Velocity testing required as is currently required for Part 29 Category B. Since all the configurations shown to date are different than existing rotorcraft, each type would have to develop their individual requirements under existing special conditions FAA Part 21. 17 (b). This means the FAA will take the opportunity to negotiate additional requirements or change requirements to ensure safety. For example, since the tiltrotor did not fit <b>normal</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> <b>category,</b> new rules were negotiated between the applicant and the FAA. As a result of this negotiation, performance requirements for Category A were increased. The rules were written in terms of guaranteed performance instead of Category A requirements. Detailed discussion will follow later. The proposed tiltrotor would likely follow along with the current tiltrotor rules with the possibility of increase Category A performance requirements. Compounding with addition of wing and auxiliary thrust to both the tandem and coaxial rotor would result in new special condition aircraft. To my knowledge, no compound tandem or compound coaxial rotor has ever been certified by FAA...|$|R

40|$|A {{completely}} simple semigroup S is a semigroup without zero {{which has}} no proper ideals and contains a primitive idempotent. It is known that S is a regular semigroup and any completely simple semigroup is isomorphic to the Rees matrix semigroup. In the study of structure theory of regular semigroups, K. S. S. Nambooripad introduced the concept of <b>normal</b> <b>categories</b> to construct the semigroup from its principal left(right) ideals using cross-connections. A <b>normal</b> <b>category</b> C is a small category with subobjects wherein each object of the category has an associated idempotent normal cone and each morphism admits a normal factorization. A cross-connection between two <b>normal</b> <b>categories</b> C and D is a local isomorphism frm D to N*C where N*C is the normal dual of the category C. In this paper, we identify the <b>normal</b> <b>categories</b> associated with a completely simple semigroup S and show that the semigroup of normal cones TL(S) is isomorphic to a semi-direct product of semigroups. We characterize the cross-connections {{in this case and}} show that each sandwich matrix P correspond to a cross-connection. Further we use each of these cross-connections to give a representation of the completely simple semigroup as a cross-connection semigroup...|$|R

40|$|The work {{provides}} a methodological {{approach to the}} safety assessment process of a Fly-By-Wire/Flight Control System of a transport <b>category</b> <b>rotorcraft.</b> Starting from {{the review of the}} documents forming the guidelines for the safety assessment process for airborne systems and equipments, the phases of the process are described and practically applied giving an example. The attention is focused on the first phases of the safety assessment process. Once the rotorcraft-level and the system-level functional requirements are defined, a rotorcraft-level Functional Hazard Assessment is carried out for a particular function involving the Flight Control System. A system-level FHA is then carried out pointing out the failure conditions for two different Flight Control System architectures. To give an example about how to conduct the Preliminary System Safety Assessment, a Fault Tree Analysis for a particular system-level functional failure is performed on both architectures, pointing out the effects of different design choices on the safety and operative requirement...|$|R
