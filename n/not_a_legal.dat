5|$|The Mint then struck silver or gold in {{response}} to deposits by those holding bullion, and made little profit from those transactions. By the 1840s, profits, or seignorage, from monetizing copper into cents helped fund the Mint. In 1849, copper prices rose sharply, causing the Department of the Treasury to investigate possible alternatives to the large one-cent pieces. The cent was unpopular in trade; as it was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> tender, nobody had to take it, and banks and merchants often refused it. The cent was disliked for its large size as well. In 1837, the eccentric New York chemist Lewis Feuchtwanger had experimented with a smaller cent size in making model coins {{as part of a}} plan to sell his alloy (similar to base-metal German silver) to the government for use in coinage. His pieces circulated as hard times tokens in the recession years of the late 1830s and early 1840s.|$|E
5|$|Very {{was born}} on August 28, 1813, in Salem, Massachusetts and {{spent much of his}} {{childhood}} at sea. He was the oldest of six children, born out of wedlock to two first cousins; his sister Lydia also became a writer. His mother, Lydia Very, was known for being an aggressive freethinker who made her atheistic beliefs known to all. She believed that marriage was only a moral arrangement and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> one. His father, also named Jones Very, was a captain during the War of 1812 and was held in Nova Scotia for a time by the British as a prisoner of war. When the younger Jones Very was ten, his father, by then a shipmaster, took him on a sailing voyage to Russia. A year later, his father had Very serve as a cabin boy on a trip to New Orleans, Louisiana. His father died on the return trip, apparently due to a lung disease he contracted while in Nova Scotia.|$|E

25|$|Cohabitation is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> {{basis for}} inheritance, since {{partners}} {{are not included}} in the legal circle of heirs.

25|$|Of course, we may {{expect to}} hear more about this part of the question; but even supposing Sir Morton Peto's apology to be true in point of fact, what a pitiful apology it is!

25|$|In general, {{defining}} {{whether an}} individual is guilty of misconduct requires a detailed investigation by the individual's employing academic institution. Such investigations require detailed and rigorous processes and can be extremely costly. Furthermore, the more senior the individual under suspicion, {{the more likely it}} is that conflicts of interest will compromise the investigation. In many countries (with the notable exception of the United States) acquisition of funds on the basis of fraudulent data is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> offence and there is consequently no regulator to oversee investigations into alleged research misconduct. Universities therefore have few incentives to investigate allegations in a robust manner, or act on the findings of such investigations if they vindicate the allegation.|$|E

Among the responsibilities taken on by the partners in their life together, the only ones legally enforced are those listed in the civil law. When they have a common business, their relations are regulated by the rules of commercial law. If they break up, the partners have no access to the legally recognized rights of a spouse in a divorce. Current and former partners in cohabitation have no right to alimony or financial support.|$|E

25|$|Up until 2013 the MCC was {{a private}} members club (and this meant that it had the status of an unincorporated {{association}}). This status had several limitations. Since an unincorporated association is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> entity, it could not own property (such as Lord's Cricket Ground itself) in its own name. It could not sue anybody, or indeed be sued (any legal action {{had to be taken}} against the Secretary & Chief Executive personally). In the event that a claim was successful, the committee and even the members themselves would have had to fund any financial shortfall. The club therefore called a Special General Meeting in June 2012 to consider petitioning the Queen in Council to incorporate the club by Royal Charter. The charter would remove many of the barriers and simplify the administration of the club.|$|E
25|$|Indonesian {{politics}} and religious affairs went through turmoil from 1959 to 1962, with Sukarno dissolving the Konstituante and weakening {{the impact of}} communist movement in Indonesia along with political Islam. Nevertheless, officially identifying their religion as Hinduism was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> possibility for Indonesians until 1962, when it became the fifth state-recognized religion. This recognition was initially sought by Balinese religious organizations and granted {{for the sake of}} Bali, where the majority were Hindu. Between 1966 and 1980, along with Balinese Hindus, large numbers of Indonesians in eastern Java, as well as parts of South Sulawesi, North Sumatra, Central and South Kalimantan officially declared themselves to be Hindus. They politically organized themselves to press and preserve their rights. The largest of these organizations, Parisada Hindu Dharma Bali, changed its name to Parisada Hindu Dharma Indonesia (PHDI) in 1986, reflecting subsequent efforts to define Hinduism as a national rather than just a Balinese concern.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, then prime {{minister}} Brian Mulroney {{made an offer}} of individual medallions, a museum wing, and other collective measures involving several other redress-seeking communities. These were rejected outright by the Chinese Canadian national groups. After Jean Chrétien, in the same year, replaced Mulroney as {{prime minister}}, the Cabinet openly refused to provide an apology or redress. Still, the CCNC and its supporters continued to raise the issue whenever they could, including a submission to the United Nations Human Rights Commission and eventually undertaking court action against the Crown-in-Council, arguing that the federal Crown should not be profiting from racism {{and that it had}} a responsibility under both the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and international human rights law. In addition, the 1988 apology and compensation for the internment of Japanese Canadians during the Second World War was regarded as a precedent for redressing other racially motivated policies. The Ontario court declared in 2001 that the government of Canada had no obligation to redress the head tax levied on Chinese immigrants because the Charter had no retroactive application and the case of internment of Japanese Canadians was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> precedent. Two appeals in 2002 and 2003 were unsuccessful.|$|E

25|$|Immediately upon {{taking office}} in 1993, Chrétien {{cancelled}} {{the contract to}} buy the EH-101 helicopters and paid a $157.8 million termination fee to AgustaWestland. Additionally, Chrétien kept his Red Book promise of spending $6billion on infrastructure {{to stimulate the economy}} out of recession by signing the necessary orders, and to cancel the privatization of Pearson airport. The consortium that was due to take ownership of Pearson sued for breach of contract, which led the government to settle out of court in April 1997 for $60 million in damages. Chrétien phoned President Bill Clinton of the United States in November 1993 to ask him to renegotiate aspects of NAFTA. Clinton bluntly refused, saying that it had been extremely difficult to get Congress to ratify NAFTA, and if NAFTA was renegotiated, then he would have to submit the renegotiated treaty again for ratification, which was not something {{that he was going to}} do just for the sake of Chrétien. Clinton informed the Prime Minister that he either scrap NAFTA or accept it as it was, and at most he could offer were a few cosmetic concessions like writing a letter saying the United States was not interested in taking over Canada's energy and water. Chrétien chose the latter, and sought to portray Clinton's letter as a major American concession that constituted a renegotiated NAFTA, though in fact Clinton's letter was not legally binding and meant nothing. Only treaties ratified by Congress are legally binding on the U.S. government and presidential letters impose only a moral obligation, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> one, on the U.S government.|$|E
25|$|Lt. Gen. Grant, {{failing to}} find Stanton at the War Department, sent {{a note to}} his home by courier {{on the evening of}} April 21. The matter was urgent. Maj. Gen. Sherman, who had {{established}} his army headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina, had negotiated a peace deal with Confederate commander Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, with the grace of Confederate States Secretary of War John C. Breckinridge. Sherman had been authorized to negotiate with the Southerners only in matters regarding the military, as Grant had been with Lee. Sherman explicitly acknowledged that his negotiations with Confederate leaders were to stay firmly in the realm of military policy, but flouted the limitations anyway. Sherman's deal contained, as expected, a termination of hostilities with the South, but also specified that Southern governments who had rebelled against the United States were to be recognized by the federal government once they swore allegiance to the United States. Further, the deal's terms provided for federal courts to be reinstated in rebellious states, as well as the restoration of property and voting rights to Southerners, and a blanket pardon for Southerners who had rebelled. The deal went even further, allowing Southern troops to place their weapons in the hands of their states' governments, which would effectively rearm the Southern states. Sherman's truce also allotted power to the Supreme Court to resolve jurisdictional disputes between state and local governments in the South, which was a political issue, and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> issue, making that a power the court did not constitutionally have.|$|E
25|$|In Adams’ case, {{the court}} did not ignore the {{suggestion}} that he had hastened death and, as Devlin makes clear, he needed to clarify for the jury, and incidentally the medical profession, {{the extent to which the}} law allowed the orthodox doctor to go in easing the passing of the dying. Mahar regards Adam’s statements to Hannam on Mrs Morrell as less about his guilt or innocence than a disconnection between the medical and legal views on assisted dying: Adams never denied giving his patients large doses of opiates, but denied it was murder. This was not simply Adams' idiosyncratic view, as appears from the evidence of Dr. Douthwaite for the prosecution, who accepted that a physician might knowingly give fatal doses of pain relieving drugs to a terminally ill patients, adding it was not his business to say whether it was murder. Devlin’s directions to the jury confirmed that it was a medical issue, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> or moral one, whether Adam’s treatment was designed to promote comfort. Devlin’s view was that Adams may have been guilty of mercy killing or even perhaps finishing off a troublesome patient, but was one who cared for his patients to the best of his ability. Adams eased the passing of Mrs Morrell, but his greed brought his motives into question. Mahar notes an editorial in a medical journal following the case suggested that the publicity it caused might hamper medical discretion, but claimed the use of opiates in terminal cases was essential. Adams may be seen as an extreme case in their use, but other doctors also used them to ease the passing.|$|E
