5|$|In November 1677, Anne's elder sister, Mary, married their Dutch first cousin, William of Orange, at St James's Palace, but Anne {{could not}} attend the wedding because she was {{confined}} to her room with smallpox. By the time she recovered, Mary had already left for her <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands. Lady Frances Villiers contracted the disease, and died. Anne's aunt Lady Henrietta Hyde (the wife of Laurence Hyde) was appointed as her new governess. A year later, Anne and her stepmother visited Mary in Holland for two weeks.|$|E
5|$|The {{predictions}} made by Diem and Ely {{were extremely}} inaccurate. There had been heavy fighting in northern Vietnam, where the Vietminh {{were at their}} strongest, and many people {{had been forced to}} abandon their homes. Although French charities had been operating in the north, the refugee camps were disorganised and were able to provide little more than shelter. As a result, there was a great number of northerners who wanted to leave and start a <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south.|$|E
5|$|The rate of {{immigration}} from Europe grew steeply after the Civil War, and Manhattan became the first stop for millions seeking a <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, a role acknowledged by {{the dedication of the}} Statue of Liberty on October 28, 1886, a gift from the people of France. The new European immigration brought further social upheaval. In a city of tenements packed with poorly paid laborers from dozens of nations, the city was a hotbed of revolution (including anarchists and communists among others), syndicalism, racketeering, and unionization.|$|E

5|$|While {{the rest}} of the family gets used to their new home, Marge becomes homesick. Homer sneaks her back into Springfield one night under the {{disguise}} of Mr. Burns and Smithers, and they spend the night getting drunk and subsequently having drunken sex in their old abandoned home. However, Chief Wiggum sees through their disguises, and rallies the people of Springfield to the Simpson home to capture Homer and Marge. Marge is initially angry at the members of the mob, but she stuns them by saying that she does not want to live in Springfield or deal with them anymore, having found a place to live where she and her family can be accepted for who they are and love each other without worry of hate and judgment from others. Marge and Homer march through the visibly disillusioned crowd and return to The Outlands. Back in the Simpsons' new home, Bart discovers Lenny and Carl sneaking in. They tell the family they long to start a <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Outlands. Soon, Moe, Mayor Quimby, and many other Springfield residents show up, wishing to abandon their lives in Springfield and start over in The Outlands. Soon, all of Springfield moves there to start new lives with the Simpsons, and they begin rebuilding a new city which they name Springfield.|$|E

25|$|It was {{followed}} by the darker, less commercial The Mosquito Coast (1986), Paul Schrader's adaptation of Paul Theroux's novel, with Ford playing a man obsessively pursuing his dream to start a <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Central American jungle with his family. These dramatic parts provided Harrison Ford with important opportunities to break the typecasting of his career-making roles in the Star Wars and Indiana Jones series. Both films showed off his ability to play more subtle and substantial characters and he was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his work in Witness, the only Academy Awards recognition in his career. The Mosquito Coast is also notable for an impressive performance by the young River Phoenix.|$|E
25|$|Asturias and Alcantara, like Andes, {{had spent}} the war in Government service. Alcantara was {{released}} in August 1947, refitted for commercial civilian service and in October 1948 joined Andes on RML's South American route. But Asturias had been badly damaged by a torpedo in 1943, her repairs were not completed until after the war, and she then became property of the Ministry of Transport. At the time many people wanted to emigrate from war-damaged Britain to a <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British Dominions, so the MoT had Asturias refitted to carry emigrants to Australia. RML managed and crewed Asturias under contract, but she never returned to the route for which she was built. Thus Lord Essendon's 1932 plan to have three liners on RML's prestige South American route was never fulfilled.|$|E
