When the show ended at 22:45, Bueno {{went to the}} restaurant El Corralón in Buenos Aires' Palermo neighborhood, where he dined with his family, Fernando Olmedo (son of the comedian Alberto Olmedo) and comedian Pepe Parada. Olmedo remarked that he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> of Bueno's shows, and Bueno invited him to a show that same night at the club Escándalo in La Plata. Bueno gave a two-and-a-half hour performance {{in front of an}} audience of 2,000. When the concert was over, he was asked to stay at the club to rest, but Bueno refused, expressing his desire to drive.|$|E

25|$|Professor Archimedes Q. Porter (Jeff Bennett) - Father of Jane, Professor Porter is a noted {{scientist}} {{with years of}} expertise studying gorillas, though prior to arriving in Africa in the first film, he's <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> in the wild. Sometimes the kindhearted professor gets so absorbed in his thinking that he simply forgets what he's doing. Even so, Jane doesn't bat an eye at her father's eccentric antics—she's used to them and shares his enthusiasm. When they both finally meet the gorillas, it's the fulfillment of a lifelong dream, even if the professor does faint at the sight.|$|E

500|$|Reagan {{assumed the}} role of {{unofficial}} [...] "protector" [...] for her husband after the attempted assassination in 1981. On March 30 of that year, President Reagan and three others were shot by troubled 25-year old John Hinckley, Jr as they left the Washington Hilton hotel. Nancy was alerted and arrived at George Washington University Hospital, where the President was hospitalized. She recalled having seen [...] "emergency rooms before, but I had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> like this – with my husband in it." [...] She was escorted into a waiting room, and when granted access to see her husband, he quipped to her, [...] "Honey, I forgot to duck", borrowing the defeated boxer Jack Dempsey's jest to his wife.|$|E
500|$|After Howe's {{first year}} in Halifax, {{engineering}} instruction of upperclassmen was taken away from Dalhousie and other universities in the province, {{and placed in a}} separate technical institute in which Howe had no role. Howe later stated that he liked Dalhousie, and had this change not occurred, he might have remained there as a professor. In 1913, however, a former colleague at Dalhousie, Robert Magill, who had recently been appointed chairman of the Board of Grain Commissioners, offered Howe the post of chief engineer, with responsibility for supervising the construction of grain elevators. Howe stated, [...] "I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> of those things in my life, but I'll take the job." [...] The same year, he applied to become a British subject, as Canadians then were.|$|E

500|$|Mr. Noodle {{was played}} by Broadway actor Bill Irwin, who had {{previously}} worked with Sherman in short films for Sesame Street. [...] When he became unavailable, Sherman asked her friend Michael Jeter to replace Irwin as Mr. Noodle's brother Mr. Noodle. [...] Jeter was in the role beginning in 2000, {{until his death in}} 2003. Kristin Chenoweth played Mr. Noodle's sister Ms. Noodle, and Sarah Jones played Mr. Noodle's other sister Miss Noodle. [...] As of January 2017, Daveed Diggs and comedian Daniel Koren, have played two more of Mr. Noodle's brothers. [...] According to Freudberg, [...] "Mr. Noodle, who never speaks, is all about trial and error. When you throw him a hat, he acts like he's <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> before.

500|$|... "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{features}} the American rock band Phish as themselves. The idea {{to include the}} band in the episode was pitched during the episode's production. [...] "Phish plays at the rally. We thought they'd be the perfect group to use for the plot.", Jean said. Meyer, who pitched the episode's premise, was {{a fan of the}} band, but Jean did not know much of them before they appeared in the episode; [...] "I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> of their concerts, so I'm not the most familiar", he said. He first became aware of the band after reading an article about them in Entertainment Weekly. As they worked on the episode however, Jean became more acquainted with the band members. [...] "They were nice", he said. [...] "Jon Fishman said to me that the band had talked from time to time about if they were to ever be on The Simpsons, what it would be like. I said, 'Well, how close was it?' He said, 'Pretty close to what we expected.' (laughs) That was gratifying." ...|$|E
500|$|Getting {{funding for}} the project was {{difficult}} because of the taboos against death, and the crew had to approach several companies before Departures was approved by Toshiaki Nakazawa and Yasuhiro Mase. According to the film's director, Yōjirō Takita, a consideration in taking on the film was {{the age of the}} crew: [...] "we got to a certain point in our lives when death was creeping up to become a factor around us". Kundō Koyama was enlisted to provide the script, his first for a feature film; his previous experience had been in scripting for television and stage. Takita, who had begun his career in the pink film genre before entering mainstream filmmaking in 1986 with Comic Magazine, took on the director's role in 2006, after producer Toshiaki Nakazawa presented him with the first draft of the script. In a later interview he stated [...] "I wanted to make a film {{from the perspective of a}} person who deals with something so universal and yet is looked down upon, and even discriminated against". Although he knew of the encoffining ceremony, he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> performed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} due for release on 22 November 2010, however, the release date was later brought forward {{a week to}} 15 November 2010. Barlow claimed that {{the decision was made}} after [...] "massive pre-orders for the album" [...] and after [...] "analysing airplay and order data" [...] with him revealing that [...] "We've also <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> of our singles played so much." [...] A Take That spokesman claimed the change in release was also due to [...] "huge response to their press conference" [...] where they announced tour dates.|$|E

The police had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>one,</b> of course, but I just told them it was in conformity with international practice and races of this type were organised in all different countries and they had no queries at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chinook salmon were {{described}} and enthusiastically eaten by the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Lewis wrote that, when fresh, they tasted {{better than any}} other fish he had ever eaten. They did not particularly like dried or [...] "pounded" [...] salmon. Lewis and Clark knew about Pacific salmon, but had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>one.</b> The Western world had known about Pacific salmon since the late 18th century. Maritime fur traders and explorers, such as George Vancouver, frequently acquired salmon by trade with the indigenous people of the Northwest coast. Lewis and Clark first encountered Chinook salmon as a gift from Chief Cameahwait, on August 13, 1805, near Lemhi Pass. Tasting it convinced Lewis they had crossed the continental divide.|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Noodle, a major {{character}} in the [...] "Elmo's World" [...] segment, was played by Broadway actor Bill Irwin, who had previously worked with Arlene Sherman (one of the show's executive producers) in short films for Sesame Street. When he became unavailable, Sherman asked her friend Michael Jeter to replace Irwin as Mr. Noodle's brother Mr. Noodle. Jeter was in the role beginning in 2000, {{until his death in}} 2003. Kristin Chenoweth played Mr. Noodle's sister Ms. Noodle, and Sarah Jones played Mr. Noodle's other sister Miss Noodle. Writer Louise A. Gikow called the Noodles [...] "a dynasty of mimes...in the tradition of great silent film comedians like Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Harold Lloyd". They made mistakes, but solved them with the help of [...] "enthusiastic kid voice-overs", which empowered children and helped them feel smarter than the adults. According to long-time Sesame Street writer Judy Freudberg, [...] "Mr. Noodle, who never speaks, is all about trial and error. When you throw him a hat, he acts like he's <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> before. Kids feel empowered watching him because they can do what he can't".|$|E
2500|$|In late 2005, Helmet {{were dropped}} by Interscope {{following}} lacklustre sales for Size Matters. Helmet then signed with Warcon Enterprises {{and announced that}} a new album was in the works. Helmet performed at the 2006 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, with a temporary lineup consisting of Charlie Walker on drums, Chris Traynor on bass, and Anthony Truglio (formerly of Gandhi) on guitar. The new album, Monochrome, was recorded and co-produced by Wharton Tiers, who recorded Helmet's first two albums, Strap It On and Meantime. For the album, Hamilton and Traynor returned to the studio with newly recruited drummer, Mike Jost (formerly of Adair). Helmet headlined the 2006 Warped Tour in support of Monochrome, with Jeremy Chatelain reprising his role from the 2005 Size Matters tour. The band later split with Warcon due {{to a variety of}} financial disputes between Hamilton and the label's owners. Hamilton stated [...] "Amphetamine Reptile and Interscope were both fantastic experiences for us, and Warcon {{was the first time that}} I’d actually run into any problems with a label. I trusted somebody and got screwed. I’m not bitter about it, but I lost a lot of money. They never paid me tour support that they were contractually obligated to pay. There were a lot of things. I’ve <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>one</b> penny of royalties from them, but I own the record [...] now, so it’s my record." ...|$|E

50|$|The plot is {{considered}} minimalistic, as not much happens aside from walking and talking. The two characters' ideas and perspectives on {{life and love}} are detailed. Jesse is a romantic disguised as a cynic, and Céline is seemingly a romantic, albeit with some doubts.
