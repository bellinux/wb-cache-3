5|$|The slouch hat was the {{preferred}} choice of many soldiers, including officers. The hat was <b>normally</b> <b>a</b> floppy, wide brimmed, woolen body head-cover, meant {{to protect the}} individual from the sun, and inclement weather. It was <b>normally</b> <b>a</b> civilian hat, of brown, gray, or black wool. This simple hat saw widespread use throughout the Confederate Armies, and even with U.S. Army personnel. Occasionally, the hat was adorned with insignia of the wearer's preference, {{and may have been}} pinned up for the drill {{in the use of the}} regular weapon of the time, the Rifled-musket.|$|E
5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving (or stalled) boundary between two air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other.

5|$|<b>Normally,</b> <b>a</b> {{student who}} completes the program may {{graduate}} with honors if his general weighted average (GWA) is 1.75 or above. The title summa cum laude is awarded to graduates who obtain a GWA of 1.20 or above, magna cum laude to graduates with a GWA of 1.45 to 1.20, and cum laude to graduates with a GWA of between 1.75 and 1.45. As of 2011 {{there have been}} 30 summa cum laudes who have graduated from UPLB.|$|E
5|$|String {{inverters}} {{are substantially}} lower in capacity, {{of the order}} of 10kW, and condition the output of a single array string. This is <b>normally</b> <b>a</b> whole, or part of, a row of solar arrays within the overall plant. String inverters can enhance the efficiency of solar parks, where different parts of the array are experiencing different levels of insolation, for example where arranged at different orientations, or closely packed to minimise site area.|$|E
5|$|The Aurigids are <b>normally</b> <b>a</b> placid Class II {{meteor shower}} that {{peaks in the}} early morning hours of September 1, {{beginning}} on August 28 every year. Though the maximum zenithal hourly rate is 2–5 meteors per hour, the Aurigids are fast, with an entry velocity of /sec. The annual Aurigids have a radiant located about two degrees north of Theta Aurigae, a third-magnitude star in the center of the constellation. The Aurigids end on September 4. Some years, the maximum rate has reached 9–30 meteors per hour.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{additional}} vowels {{are sometimes}} described as significantly distinct: [...] or , which is <b>normally</b> <b>an</b> allophone of , which is <b>normally</b> <b>an</b> allophone of and [...] (an unrounded, centralised, mid front vowel), which is <b>normally</b> <b>an</b> allophone of [...] These sounds normally occur in closed syllables; because Tibetan {{does not allow}} geminated consonants, there are cases in which one syllable ends with the same sound as the one following it. The {{result is that the}} first is pronounced as an open syllable but retains the vowel typical of a closed syllable. For instance, zhabs (foot) is pronounced [...] and pad (borrowing from Sanskrit padma, lotus) is pronounced , but the compound word, zhabs pad is pronounced [...] This process can result in minimal pairs involving sounds that are otherwise allophones.|$|R

5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} is hunted by {{birds of prey}} {{including}} the boreal owl, short-eared owl, tawny owl, Ural owl, Eurasian eagle-owl, golden eagle, kestrel, common buzzard, red kite, northern goshawk, peregrine falcon, and sparrowhawk. The eggs and chicks may be targeted by cats and corvids, although the adults are fearless in defence of their nests, occasionally even attacking humans. The mistle thrush is not <b>normally</b> <b>a</b> host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite.|$|E
5|$|Under a cold cyclone, 500hPa {{temperatures}} {{can fall}} {{as low as}} −30°C, which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres. This also explains why moisture in the mid-levels of the troposphere, roughly at the 500hPa level, is <b>normally</b> <b>a</b> requirement for development. However, when dry air is found at the same height, temperatures at 500hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres. At heights near the tropopause, the 30-year average temperature (as measured in the period encompassing 1961 through 1990) was −77°C (−105°F).|$|E
5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving boundary between two different air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain in the same area for long periods of time, usually moving in waves. There is <b>normally</b> <b>a</b> broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherms. A wide variety of weather can be found along a {{stationary front}}, but usually clouds and prolonged precipitation are found there. Stationary fronts will either dissipate after several days or devolve into shear lines, but can change into a cold or warm front if conditions aloft change causing a driving of one air mass or the other. Stationary fronts are marked on weather maps with alternating red half-circles and blue spikes pointing in opposite directions, indicating no significant movement.|$|E

5|$|About 190 {{species of}} {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} park have been registered, {{most of which are}} part of the natural composition of the Siberian taiga. Marsh Labrador tea is the most common, the park being one of only three locations in Norway where it occurs. The most common berry plant is lingonberry; common bilberry and bog bilberry are also common, but do not carry good yields of berries. In August there is <b>normally</b> <b>a</b> good yield of cloudberry, and occasionally there can be found Arctic raspberry. There is a limited number of marine plants. The steep cliffs at Revsaksskaret allow mountainous plants to thrive, such as Alpine chickweed, white bluegrass and brittle bladder-fern. These were common throughout the area after the last glacial period, but have vanished with forestation. Other mountainous plants common in the region are not found in Pasvik because of low oxygen levels in the lower soil levels.|$|E
5|$|At 18:00 on 29 January 1968, South Vietnamese forces began a 36-hour ceasefire {{in celebration}} of {{the arrival of the}} Year of the Monkey. Earlier, the communists had {{declared}} a seven-day ceasefire as part of the Tet festival, that was <b>normally</b> <b>a</b> period of truce and for community gatherings and family reunions in Vietnamese society. However, unbeknown to the South Vietnamese and their allies, the North Vietnamese leadership had decided to use the cease-fire to launch a large offensive in the south in order to break the deadlock that had developed in the conflict—despite the reluctance of Democratic Republic of Vietnam President Ho Chi Minh and Defence Minister General Vo Nguyen Giap.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying (also {{referred}} to as deep fat frying) is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot fat, most commonly oil, rather than the shallow oil used in conventional frying, done in a frying pan. <b>Normally,</b> <b>a</b> deep fryer or chip pan is used for this; industrially, a pressure fryer or vacuum fryer may be used. Deep frying may also be performed using oil that is heated in a pot. Deep frying is classified as hot-fat cooking method. Typically, deep frying foods cook quickly: all sides of a food are cooked simultaneously as oil has {{a high rate of}} heat conduction.|$|E
