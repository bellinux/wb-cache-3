60|$|Everything {{connected}} with the colony was strictly practical. The decision of certain points had unquestionably given the governor trouble, though he got along with them pretty well, on the whole. A couple of young lawyers had desired to go, {{but he had the}} prudence to reject them. Law, as a science, is a very useful study, beyond a question; but the governor, rightly enough, fancied that his people could do without so much science for a few years longer. Then another doctor volunteered his services. Mark remembered the quarrels between his father and his father-in-law, and thought it better to die under one theory than under two. As regards a clergyman, Mark had greater difficulty. The question of sect was not as seriously debated half a century ago as it is to-day; still it was debated. Bristol had a very ancient society, of the persuasion of the Anglican church, and Mark's family belonged to it. Bridget, however, was a Presbyterian, and no small portion of the new colonists were what is called Wet-Quakers; that is, Friends who are not very particular in their opinions or observances. Now, religion often caused more feuds than anything else: still it was impossible to have a priest for every persuasion, and one ought to suffice for the whole colony. The question was of what sect should that one clergyman be? So many prejudices were to be consulted, that the governor was about to abandon the project in despair, when accident determined the point. Among Heaton's relatives was a young man of the name of Hornblower, no bad appellation, by the way, for one who had to sound so many notes of warning, who had received priest's orders from the hands of the well-known Dr. White, so long the presiding Bishop of America, and whose constitution imperiously demanded a milder climate than that in which he then lived. As respects him, it became a question purely of humanity, the divine being too poor to travel on his own account, and he was received on board the Rancocus, with his wife, his sister, and two children, that he might have the benefit of living within the tropics. The matter was fully explained to the other emigrants, who could not raise objections if they would, but who really were not disposed to do so in a case of such obvious motives. A good portion of them, probably, {{came to the conclusion that}} Episcopalian ministrations were better than none, though, to own the truth, the liturgy gave a good deal of scandal to a certain portion of their <b>number.</b> <b>Reading</b> prayers was so profane a thing, that these individuals could scarcely consent to be present at such a vain ceremony; nor was the discontent, on this preliminary point, fully disposed of until the governor once asked the principal objector how he got along with the Lord's Prayer, which was not only written and printed, but which usually was committed to memory! Notwithstanding this difficulty, the emigrants did get along with it without many qualms, and most of them dropped quietly into the habit of worshipping agreeably to a liturgy, just as if it were not the terrible profanity that some of them had imagined. In this way, many of our most intense prejudices get lost in new communications.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt is {{commonly}} assumed that <b>number</b> <b>reading</b> can be intact {{in patients with}} pure alexia, and that this dissociation between letter/word recognition and <b>number</b> <b>reading</b> strongly constrains theories of visual word processing. A truly selective deficit in letter/word processing would strongly {{support the hypothesis that}} there is a specialized system or area dedicated to the processing of written words. To date, however, {{there has not been a}} systematic review of studies investigating <b>number</b> <b>reading</b> in pure alexia and so the status of this assumed dissociation is unclear. We review the literature on pure alexia from 1892 to 2010, and find no well-documented classical dissociation between intact <b>number</b> <b>reading</b> and impaired letter identification in a patient with pure alexia. A few studies report strong dissociations, with <b>number</b> <b>reading</b> less impaired than letter reading, but when we apply rigorous statistical criteria to evaluate these dissociations, the difference in performance across domains is not statistically significant. There is a trend in many cases of pure alexia, however, for <b>number</b> <b>reading</b> to be less affected than letter identification and word reading. We shed new light on this asymmetry by showing that, under conditions of brief exposure, normal participants are also better at identifying digits than letters. We suggest that the difference observed in some pure alexic patients may possibly reflect an amplification of this normal difference in the processing of letters and digits, and we relate this asymmetry to intrinsic differences between the two types of symbols...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reports on}} a mildly aphasic patient with major {{disorders}} in reading, writing, and number processing.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Progress in the {{treatment}} of breathlessness at rest or on minimum exertion in patients with cancer requires a practical and valid method of measuring symptoms. A study was undertaken to explore the practicality, repeatability, and sensitivity of <b>reading</b> <b>numbers</b> as a form of exercise test in this group of patients.  METHODS—Thirty patients with cancer and 30 age matched healthy subjects <b>read</b> <b>numbers</b> aloud as quickly and clearly as they could for 60 seconds. After five readings the maximum <b>number</b> of <b>numbers</b> <b>read</b> and the <b>number</b> <b>read</b> per breath was noted. This procedure was carried out twice in one day and one week later to assess within and between day repeatability. The sensitivity of the test was assessed by making measurements in 13 patients with cancer before and after drainage of their pleural effusion.  RESULTS—The concept was easily understood by all subjects. Twelve patients were unable to complete five readings in all tests due to tiredness. Compared with control subjects patients <b>read</b> fewer <b>numbers</b> in the three tests (87 - 89 % of control) and fewer numbers per breath (59 - 60 % of control). Repeatability was good both within and between days. After drainage of their effusion all patients were less breathless and there was an increase in both the maximum <b>number</b> of <b>numbers</b> <b>read</b> (23 %) and the <b>number</b> <b>read</b> per breath (60 %).  CONCLUSIONS—The <b>number</b> of <b>numbers</b> <b>read</b> and the <b>number</b> <b>read</b> per breath over 60 seconds was practical, easy to carry out, showed good repeatability within and between days and was sensitive to the improvement seen following drainage of a pleural effusion. It may be a useful measure of the limiting effect of breathlessness in this group of patients. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a single-case {{study of a}} patient (NR) showing a very specific (though not isolated) disorder in Arabic <b>number</b> <b>reading.</b> The type of reading errors and {{the pattern of the}} results observed in tasks tapping different components of the number processing system support the hypothesis of a deficit in the syntactic module of the Arabic comprehension system (in McCloskey, Sokol, & Goodman's [1986] model). NR's deficit is also examined in the light of two other <b>number</b> <b>reading</b> models: Seron and Deloche (1984) and Cohen and Dehaene (1991). In addition, the opposition beween semantic and asemantic transcoding models is discussed. In tasks based on a representation of the quantity, NR's errors with Arabic forms seem to result from correct semantic processing based on the expected verbal transcoded forms; this is easily interpretable in the semantic transcoding model (e. g. McCloskey et al., 1986), whereas in asemantic perspectives (e. g. Seron & Deloche, 1984; Cohen & Dehaene, 1991) no direct explanation is proposed.

However, these findings remain debated and have not been extended to other tasks such as reading or visual exploration. Here, in the same study, we examined the effect of body position (BP) and visual environment (VE) on relatively ecological tests of spatial neglect. Among 17 patients with right-hemisphere stroke, 12 were neglect and five were non-neglect in clinical tests. They were compared with 12 healthy control participants in four tasks: line bisection, text reading, <b>number</b> <b>reading,</b> and visual exploration. Tasks were performed on a computer screen in two BP (sitting and supine) and two VE (light and dark) conditions. We found that placing patients in darkness reduced contralesional omissions in the visual exploratory task and, to a smaller extent, in <b>number</b> <b>reading.</b> Conversely, the supine position did not influence performance, and even resulted in cognitive slowing, especially in reading. In conclusion, we confirmed that reducing visual information can improve performance, but only to a limited extent. This justifies strict control of peripheral visual information when exploring neglect patients. Conversely, positioning neglect patients in the supine position can have a discrete negative effect on cognitive functioning, and this effect {{must be taken into account}} during therapy...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that mathematical disabilities (MD) emerge as a consequence of impairments in basic number processing skills. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate basic number processing skills in children with Velo-Cardio-Facial Syndrome (VCFS), a common genetic disorder with a high prevalence of MD, and to examine whether these basic low-level skills account for their performance in single-digit arithmetic. Twenty-five children with VCFS and 25 individually matched controls (age range: 6 – 12 years) participated. They all completed two basic number processing tasks (<b>number</b> <b>reading,</b> number comparison) and three single-digit arithmetic tasks comprising addition, subtraction and multiplication. In the latter tasks, strategy use was recorded next to accuracy and speed. Our data revealed that children with VCFS were significantly slower than controls on number comparison but not on <b>number</b> <b>reading.</b> Analysis of the single-digit arithmetic data revealed that children with VCFS performed more poorly than controls on large addition and subtraction problems. Both groups did not differ on multiplication and small additions and subtractions. At the strategy level, children with VCFS were significantly slower in executing backup strategies in addition and subtraction, but showed preserved retrieval of arithmetic facts. Taken together, children with VCFS show a consistent pattern of deficits at the level of number representations, arithmetic operations and strategy use, which suggests an impaired quantity subsystem in terms of Dehaene et al. ’s model [Dehaene S, Piazza M, Pinel P, and Cohen L. Three parietal circuits for number processing. Cognitive Neuropsychology, 20 : 487 – 506, 2003].

40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} {{coupling}} between the {{processes involved in}} the preparation of motoric actions and cognitive information processing. Four studies were reported that demonstrate an involvement of motor representations in different cognitive domains ranging from “low-level" cognitive processes such as visual perception up to “high-level" cognitive processes such as the coding of abstract semantic information (e. g., word and <b>number</b> <b>reading).</b> The outcomes of the empirical work can be summered by four effects: the “priming” of visual motion perception by motor actions (chapter 2), the interaction between action planning and word processing (chapter 3), the “priming” of grasping actions by numbers (chapter 4), and the effect of coding intentions on spatial number representations (chapter 5). All experimental findings show that the functional connections between motor actions and cognitive processes are not restricted to certain types of information or certain representational domains. They provide thus support for the view that the involvement of motor representations is a universal coding principle of the brain to deal with different kinds of cognitive demands. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{previously}} reported mathematical disabilities (MD) of children with Velo-Cardio-Facial Syndrome (VCFS) in children of a younger age range. Fourteen children with VCFS (aged 6 - 10 years) participated in this study. These children were individually matched on sex, IQ, age and parental educational level to a control group of peers, selected from the same classes. A broad range of mathematical abilities were assessed, comprising <b>number</b> <b>reading</b> and writing, number comparison, counting, single-digit arithmetic, multidigit arithmetic and word problem solving. Consistent with previous reports, children with VCFS were significantly slower in counting numerosities and they tended to perform more poorly on number comparison. These results indicate that difficulties in low-level number processing in children with VCFS occur already at a very young age. Furthermore, children with VCFS demonstrated preserved retrieval of arithmetic facts, but, in contrast to older children with VCFS, no procedural difficulties in mathematics were observed. Finally, word problem solving appeared to be an important area of weakness, starting already at this young age. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Reading and {{spelling}} performance {{have a significant}} correlation with number transcoding, which {{is the ability to}} establish a relationship between the verbal and Arabic representations of numbers, when a conversion of numerical symbols from one notation to the other is necessary. The aim of the present study is to reveal shared and specific mechanisms involved in reading and writing words and Arabic numerals in Brazilian school-aged children. One hundred and seventy two children from 2 nd to 4 th grades were evaluated. All of them had normal intelligence. We conducted a series of hierarchical regression models using scores on word spelling and reading single words and Arabic numerals, as dependent variables. As predictor variables we investigated intelligence, the phonological and visuospatial components of working memory and phonemic awareness. All of the writing and reading tasks (single word spelling and reading as well as <b>number</b> <b>reading</b> and number writing) were significantly correlated to each other. In the regressions models, phonological working memory was specifically associated to word reading. Phonemic awareness was the only cognitive variables that systematically predicted all of the school skills investigated, both numerical and word tasks.

Cognitive Neuropsychology, 20, 487 - 506] state that mathematical performance {{is made possible}} by two functionally and anatomically distinct subsystems of number processing: a verbal system located in the angular gyrus, which underlies the retrieval of arithmetic facts, and a quantity system located in the intraparietal sulcus, which subserves operations that involve semantic manipulations of quantity. According to this model, subtypes of math disability (MD) should be traceable to differential impairments in these subsystems. The present study investigated MD in children with velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS) and aimed to verify which of these subsystems of number processing is impaired in these children. Eleven children with VCFS and 11 individually matched controls, selected from the same classes, completed a large battery of mathematical tests. Our data revealed that children with VCFS had preserved <b>number</b> <b>reading</b> abilities and preserved retrieval of arithmetic facts, both of which indicate that the verbal subsystem is not impaired in VCFS.
