40|$|Background: The {{acceptability}} of prenatal screening and diagnosis of Down syndrome is dependent, in part, on the gestational {{age at which}} the testing is offered. First trimester screening could be advantageous if it has sufficient efficacy and can be effectively delivered. Issues: Two first trimester maternal serum screening markers, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and free h-human chorionic gonadotropin (h-hCG), are useful for identifying women {{at increased risk for}} fetal Down syndrome. In addition, measurement of an enlarged thickness of the subcutaneous fluid-filled space {{at the back of the}} neck of the developing fetus (referred to as nuchal translucency or <b>NT)</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> demonstrated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an indicator for these high-risk pregnancies. When these three parameters are combined, estimates for Down syndrome efficacy exceed those currently attainable in the second trimester. Women who are screen-positive in the first trimester can elect to receive cytogenetic testing of a chorionic villus biopsy. The first trimester tests could also, theoretically, be combined with the second trimester maternal serum screening tests (integrated screening) to obtain even higher levels of efficacy. There are, however, several practical limitations to first trimester and integrated screening. These include scheduling of testing within relatively narrow gestational age intervals, availability of appropriately trained ultrasonographers for NT measurement, risks associated with chorionic villus biopsy, and costs. There is also increasing evidence that an enlarged NT measurement is indicative of a high risk for spontaneous abortion and for fetal abnormalities that are not detectable by cytogenetic analysis.

40|$|Arctic {{vegetation}} {{is characterized}} by high spatial variability in plant functional type (PFT) composition and gross primary productivity (P). Despite this variability, the two main drivers of P in sub-Arctic tundra are leaf area index (LT) and total foliar nitrogen (NT). LT and <b>NT</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tightly coupled across PFTs in sub-Arctic tundra vegetation, which simplifies up-scaling by allowing quantification of the main drivers of P from remotely sensed LT. Our objective <b>was</b> <b>to</b> test the LT–NT relationship across multiple Arctic latitudes and to assess LT {{as a predictor of}} P for the pan-Arctic. Including PFT-specific parameters in models of LT–NT coupling provided only incremental improvements in model fit, but significant improvements were gained from including site-specific parameters. The degree of curvature in the LT–NT relationship, controlled by a fitted canopy nitrogen extinction co-efficient, <b>was</b> negatively related <b>to</b> average levels of diffuse radiation at a site. This is consistent with theoretical predictions of more uniform vertical canopy N distributions under diffuse light conditions. Higher latitude sites had higher average leaf N content by mass (NM), and we show {{for the first time that}} LT–NT coupling is achieved across latitudes via canopy-scale trade-offs between NM and leaf mass per unit leaf area (LM).

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} interplanetary causes of some {{selected}} magnetic storms {{that occurred during}} the period of 1999 – 2001. The storm-time (st) effects in the ionospheric F 2 -region during the periods of 1989 – 1991 and 1999 – 2001, and VHF scintillations during the period of 1999 – 2001, at Ahmadabad, a low latitude station at the ionization anomaly crest in the Indian region, are also studied. A southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF BS) is the precondition for the formation of the storms. The main phase of 60 % of intense and very intense storms occurs by a multi-step growth in the ring current. First-step growth in the ring current <b>is</b> due <b>to</b> the IMF BS in the sheath region behind the fast forward shock. Second-step growth in the ring current <b>is</b> possibly due <b>to</b> ionospheric origin ions (particularly O+) which can be identified by the initial fast recovery of the storms. Magnetic clouds are also probable sources of the growth in the ring current. The recovery phase begins with northward turning of IMF with a delay ≈ 1 – 3 h. Ionosonde data show both positive and negative effects in foF 2; the negative storm effects are more pronounced with a maximum occurrence in the post-midnight period. The interplay between the st thermospheric circulation and the undisturbed circulation determines the occurrence of these effects. The negative storm effects that occur in the post-midnight period are mostly accompanied by a substantial increase in h′F. A decrease in foF 2, during intense and very intense magnetic storm, due to storm-induced circulation that brings high latitude gas with depleted [O]/[N 2] ratio to low and equatorial latitudes, dominates an increase in foF 2 due to an increase in h′F, and results in a net decrease in foF 2 in the post-midnight period. The penetrating strong magnetospheric electric fields and the electric fields generated by the disturbance dynamo play important roles. The probability of occurrence of scintillations in the post-midnight sector is enhanced for storms in which Dst⩽– 75 nT occurs in the post-midnight to dawn sector. Magnetic storms with Dst<− 100 <b>nT</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> most effective in producing such scintillations. Reversal of the equatorial ionospheric electric field due to the penetration of st magnetospheric electric fields explains the occurrence of such scintillations...|$|R
