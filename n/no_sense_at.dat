It is composed in the key of D major with vocals spanning the tonal nodes of A3 to B5. Hoppus and DeLonge split vocals on the song, with the former handling verses and the latter singing the choruses. In the verses, the lyrics detail a marriage gone awry: [...] "Rather than fix the problems/They never solve them/It makes <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>at</b> all."

Matt Buchanan and Scott Ellis of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that the video [...] "makes <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>at</b> all to most Western eyes" [...] and it [...] "makes you wonder if you have accidentally taken someone else's medication" [...] whereas Deborah Netburn of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "one of the {{greatest}} videos ever to be uploaded to YouTube."

Christopher Hootan of Metro opined [...] "the return of Tom Quinn as a hired assassin in the final few seconds was a nice nod to early series of show." [...] Rob McLaughlin of Den of Geek noted that Tom's return among the final few minutes of the show was [...] "a welcome return from an old friend," [...] while Dork Adore reviewer Nick Bryan called it [...] "a nice touch," [...] also reflecting that it [...] "nailed home the central moral: no-one ever escapes from the horror.

The Cyrillic alphabet used in the film is the Russian form, not the Kazakh one, {{although most of the}} words written in it (especially the geographical names) are either misspelled or make <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>at</b> all. The English words are typed on an English keyboard with a Russian language setting.

Sacha Baron Cohen speaks Hebrew in the film, while Ken Davitian speaks Armenian. They also use several common phrases from Slavic languages: Borat's trademark expressions [...] "jagshemash" [...] (jak się masz) and [...] "chenquieh" [...] (dziękuję) echo the Polish (or other related languages) for [...] "How are you?" [...] and [...] "thank you", respectively.

2500|$|During the 2012 {{presidential primary}} campaign, {{when asked what}} the federal government’s role should be in {{responding}} to natural disasters, Romney suggested that responsibility for handling disasters should be taken from FEMA, the federal agency dedicated to disaster relief, and given to the states, or outsourced to the private sector: [...] "Every time you have an occasion to take something {{from the federal government}} and send it back to the states, that's the right direction. And if you can go even further, and send it back to the private sector, that's even better. Instead of thinking in the federal budget, what we should cut -- we should ask ourselves the opposite question. What should we keep? We should take all of what we're doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we're doing that we don't have to do? And those things we've got to stop doing, because we're borrowing $1.6 trillion more this year than we're taking in." [...] Asked whether by that he specifically meant disaster relief, he replied, “we cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids. It is simply immoral, in my view, for us to continue to rack up larger and larger debts and pass them on to our kids, knowing full well that we'll all be dead and gone before it's paid off.

2500|$|The Guardian {{released}} {{two separate}} reviews. Vicky Frost found the plane plot [...] "less compelling" [...] {{than the rest}} of the episode, though she [...] "particularly likes" [...] the idea of Dimitri and Erin breaking Harry out of CIA custody despite believing that this development rendered much of the fifth episode [...] "largely pointless." [...] Frost also praised Walker's performance as Ruth throughout the episode, but admitted to seeing her demise coming, though she felt the circumstances that led to Ruth's death [...] "did give the far more satisfying ending" [...] and the moments between Ruth and Harry were [...] "excellently done." [...] She also opined on Macfadyen's cameo raturn as Tom Quinn, [...] "it made <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>at</b> all. Obviously it was super cheesy. But obviously I completely loved it – despite knowing it was coming." [...] Sam Wollaston stated the episode [...] "was like the climax of an indulgent 70s heavy metal track, all banging drums and screaming guitars, licks and twists, and you think that's it, but then there's a bit more, all turned up to 11." [...] Wollaston enjoyed the [...] "incessant high action – stabbing, strangling, scrambling, unscrambling," [...] as well as [...] "revelation after revelation, fired from an automatic weapon." [...] He also said to have been [...] "physically and emotionally drained" [...] watching the episode, concluding the review with [...] "If Spooks is [...] "crap", as John le Carré says, then crap doesn't get much better." ...|$|E

5000|$|The film {{opened to}} mostly {{negative}} reviews and lasted only {{two to three}} weeks in theaters, dooming Kramer's first attempt at directing a thriller. The New York Times review (which wasn't full of praise for the film) focused {{on the fact that the}} movie's plot made <b>no</b> <b>sense,</b> noting <b>at</b> one point that when Hackman's character said [...] "I've done a lot of bad things in my life, but I ain't going to do that" [...] the question of [...] "What is he not going to do?"

2500|$|Episodes two {{and three}} did not fare as well, critically. Discussing the second episode, Michael Hogan in The Daily Telegraph found the quickened pace invigorating, and found the story gripping. But Neela Debnath at The Independent criticised the writing, concluding, [...] "Sadly, all the {{electric}} tension of episode one has evaporated, instead events are becoming improbable and additional drama seems to be shoehorned in {{for the sake of}} it. ... There's so much going on that it's starting to feel unbelievable." [...] Ross McG at Metro largely agreed with these points, and noted that the courtroom drama seemed bland because it essentially reiterated facts viewers already knew. Ben Skipper at the International Business Times was harsh in his appraisal, calling episode two [...] "Broadchurch first truly bad hour of television." [...] He blasted the plot, particularly the apparent kidnapping of Claire Ripley, the clichéd timing of Beth Latimer going into labour, and legal inconsistencies. He also called Marianne Jean-Baptiste's performance [...] "lacking". The [...] "Bafta-winning detective drama is a heap of old codswallop that makes <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>at</b> all," [...] said Christopher Stevens in the Daily Mail, referencing episode three. [...] "The first episode was shaky. The second was riddled with errors. But the third was beyond all forgiving." [...] There was limited praise for episode three, however. Ben Dowell at Radio Times had high praise for cinematographer John Conroy's work: [...] "The cinematography was beautiful. Broadchurch always looks fabulously bucolic but tonight the lovely summer dawns and countryside was shown off to an even greater degree..." [...] He also lauded Olivia Colman's performance, calling her [...] "once again on top form".|$|E

40|$|Abstract Based {{largely on}} some simple {{theoretical}} economic models of sports leagues, the paper argues that forcing clubs {{in a league}} to at least break-even may make <b>no</b> economic <b>sense</b> <b>at</b> all.
