40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} constructions of violence, in {{particular}} {{the ways in which}} violence is constructed as a social problem in and through policy discourses. Inspired by an earlier study into the ways in which practitioners, engaged in work with men who are violent towards their female partners, construct and understand violence, this paper highlights the extent to which societal/cultural beliefs regarding gender and violence are embedded at the levels of policy, ‘expert’ knowledge(s), and practices. Illustrating the exercise of (gendered) power through knowledge in shaping Australian government/agency responses and initiatives, it is argued that this has critical implications for the ways in which ‘gender(ed) violence’ is conceptualised, <b>named</b> <b>and</b> addressed.

50|$|Ostforschung (Research of the East) {{in general}} {{describes}} since the 18th century any German research of areas to the East of Germany. Since the 1990s, the Ostforschung {{itself is a}} subject of historic research, while the names of institutes etc. were changed to more specific ones. The term Ostforschung itself remained in use in some journals <b>and</b> <b>names</b> of <b>institutes</b> throughout the Cold War, but was replaced by more specific terms by the 1990s. For example, the journal „Zeitschrift für Ostforschung“, established in 1952, was renamed „Zeitschrift für Ostmitteleuropa-Forschung“ in 1994.. Traditional Ostforschung has been discredited by modern German historians. Ostforschung studies often reflected Western European prejudices of the time towards Poles.|$|R

40|$|Protection of Domain Names (master's degree thesis) The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to analyse a legal {{interpretation}} of the domain name. The thesis analyzes the theoretical base of this term, authorities competent to constitute rules on the market of domain <b>names</b> <b>and</b> {{to decide how to}} judge corelated disputes, attention is also drawn to the conflict of protected <b>names</b> <b>and</b> domain <b>names.</b> The important question to be answered is the eventual social significance of a juridical framework of domain name. The question of domain <b>names</b> (<b>and</b> also other <b>institutes</b> connected with internet) is a widely discussed and disputed topic. The last three decades the rules and the execution of them were constantly developing and underwent major changes. Therefore it's very interesting to watch this progress and to compare the many different points of view on the whole issue. Those were the main reasons for my research. The thesis consists of seven chapters. Chapter One, Two and Three are introductory, they define the term 'domain name', its function and structure. They also express and explain the basic terminology attached to domain names. Chapter Four analyzes the place of the domain name in Czech law system. This chapter is divided into two parts.
