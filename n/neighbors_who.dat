5|$|In 1979, Det Norske Helikoperskole started Norway's first {{helicopter}} pilot {{school at the}} airport. This was met with protests from the <b>neighbors,</b> <b>who</b> were affected by noise pollution all day long. The municipality was sued by 600 locals who wanted to prohibit the school from operating.

Following the American raid and killing of bin Laden, the Pakistani government demolished the compound in February 2012.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{to build}} a Kohl's {{department}} store on the site occupied by Kona Lanes and the already-closed Edwards Cinema Center and Ice Capades Chalet were approved by the city's planning commissioners, but they were met with resistance by <b>neighbors</b> <b>who</b> {{did not believe the}} store was a good fit for the area. Then-mayor Karen Robinson complained that Costa Mesa's policy-makers were discarding recreation as part of the quality of residents' lives, and appealed the commissioners' decision in February 2003. The city council later rejected the proposal. The continuing efforts to save Kona Lanes failed; it closed for good in May 2003 and was demolished soon after.|$|E

5|$|The {{victory was}} well {{received}} among the Albanians, and Skanderbeg's recruits increased as documented by Geraldini: Skanderbeg {{was in his}} camp with 16,000 men and every day his camp grows with young warriors. The victory was also well received in Italy with contemporaries hoping for more such news. But, despite the Ottoman loss, the victory did not signal {{an end to the}} war. Skanderbeg's damaged forces, however, had been renewed with northern warriors and Venetian battalions. The situation remained critical, however, due to the economic hardships suffered during the siege. Skanderbeg's only expectancy was for help to come from Italy, but the Italian states, despite sending contragulatory messages, send no financial aid. Hungary continued its defensive war and thus Skanderbeg's only remaining ally was Venice. Even Venice became skeptical of continuing the war and was alone in allying with Skanderbeg. Venice reported to Hungary that Mehmed had offered peace and was willing to accept it. Hungary also opted for peace, but Mehmed only sought peace with Venice in order to isolate Skanderbeg and thus peace was not signed. Skanderbeg and Venice continually began to worry about the Ottoman garrison in Elbasan. Skanderbeg led some assaults on the fortress after being urged to by Venice but failed to capture it due to lack of artillery. According to Critobulos, Mehmed was troubled after learning of the Ottoman defeat and began preparations for a new campaign. Venice itself was in conflict with its Italian <b>neighbors</b> <b>who</b> had grown wary of its increasing influence in the Balkans. With the western powers fighting among themselves, the road to Albania was open. Mehmed thus decided to send a force to subdue Albania conclusively which resulted in a new siege on Krujë.|$|E

25|$|Food {{could be}} stored by feeding it to pigs. Pre-contact Tongans also built {{elevated}} storehouses for yams. Yams would keep {{only a few}} months. Hence a household's main security was generous distribution of food to relatives and <b>neighbors,</b> <b>who</b> were thus put under an obligation to share in their turn.|$|E
25|$|In {{the weeks}} after the rioting, over 11,000 people were arrested. Many of the looters in black {{communities}} were turned in by their <b>neighbors</b> <b>who</b> were angry about the destruction of businesses employing and providing basic needs such as groceries to communities in the area. Many of the looters, fearful of prosecution by law enforcement and condemnation from their neighbors, ended up placing the looted items curbside to rid themselves of the items.|$|E
25|$|After {{slavery was}} abolished, segregationist attitudes {{in both the}} North and the South {{discouraged}} and even prevented African Americans from worshiping in the same churches as whites. Freed blacks most often established congregations and church facilities separate from their white <b>neighbors,</b> <b>who</b> were often their former masters. These new churches created communities and worship practices that were culturally distinct from other churches, including unique and empowering forms of Christianity that creolized African spiritual traditions.|$|E

25|$|Segregation affects {{people from}} all social classes. For example, a survey {{conducted}} in 2000 found that middle-income, suburban Blacks live in neighborhoods with many more whites than do poor, inner-city blacks. But their neighborhoods {{are not the same}} as those of whites having the same socioeconomic characteristics; and, in particular, middle-class blacks tend to live with white <b>neighbors</b> <b>who</b> are less affluent than they are. While, in a significant sense, they are less segregated than poor blacks, race still powerfully shapes their residential options.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1882 Daimler moved to Cannstatt just outside of Stuttgart at that time, {{purchasing}} a cottage in Cannstatt's Taubenheimstrasse, with 75,000 Gold marks from the compensation from Deutz-AG. Maybach followed in September of that year. In the garden, they added a brick extension to the roomy glass-fronted summer house and this became their workshop. Their activities alarmed the <b>neighbors</b> <b>who</b> reported them to the police as suspected counterfeiters. The police obtained a key from the gardener and raided the house in their absence, but found only engines.|$|E
