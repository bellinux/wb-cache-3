2500|$|The 60hp Schneider {{gasoline}} engine and its radiator {{are located in}} the front part of the tank, to the immediate left of the driver. The four cylinder, 135×170 9753 cc, engine is of a type specially constructed for the Schneider CA. It attains its maximum output of sixty horsepower at a thousand rpm. The three forward speeds gearbox, as well as the differentials, which can be engaged by brakes on the half shafts to steer the tank, are all located on the rear axle. They are linked to the engine in the front by a driveshaft and a primary clutch. A secondary clutch is coupled to each sprocket and can be decoupled for a tight turn. The main clutch and the main brakes can be engaged by pedals, the throttle by a handle. By means of a reverse device the three gears can also be applied to drive backwards. Steering was generally very tiring and there was a tendency to jump out of gear when the clutch was engaged too forcefully. The tank's official top speed is only 8.1km/h. Practical terrain speed was even lower at two to four km/h. The first gear at 1000 rpm equals a speed of 2km/h, the second of 3.95km/h, the third of 6.75km/h. At two kilometres per hour the vehicle can climb a slope of 55%. The capacity to overcome obstacles, limited to a parapet of about eighty centimetres, is improved by two short climbing tails, fitted to the left and right of the lower hull rear. The lower profile of the tails is curved, allowing the vehicle to gradually raise itself above a trench floor, until its centre of gravity shifts over the edge causing its hull to suddenly tumble forward. [...] The trench-crossing capacity is about 175 centimetres. The wading capacity is eighty centimetres. Two fuel gravity-feed reservoirs placed above the engine below the right front roof and <b>nose</b> <b>plate,</b> have a total capacity of 145 litres, and allow for a practical range of about fifty kilometres, though the official range is eighty kilometres. The suspension consists of seven double road wheels attached to two bogies, the one in front carrying three, the other four. The rear bogie is sprung by two vertical coil springs, the front one larger than the rear one. [...] The front bogies of the left and the right, each sprung by a vertical coil of narrow diameter, are connected to each other by means of a yoke-like transverse beam, itself attached to the hull bottom by two wide vertical coils springs, diminishing rolling and tilt when crossing rough terrain. Ground clearance is forty-one centimetres. There are five small return rollers. The six-spoked idler is attached to the front bogie and can thus move vertically to some degree. The sprocket, having twenty teeth, is however fixed in relation to the hull. It has a somewhat larger diameter than the idler, causing the upper track profile to slope slightly downwards to the front. The track consists of thirty-three flat links with a width of thirty-six centimetres. The ground pressure is about 0.75kg/cm².|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to study the effect of suckling restriction by fitting <b>nose</b> <b>plates</b> to calves on the reproductive performance of first calving crossbred beef cows managed at two nutritional levels in mid-gestation. Reproductive activity was recorded in 21 two-year-old Hereford x Friesian and Simmental x Friesian primiparous cows before and after restriction of calf suckling. Cows were allocated two pastures allowances from day 112 to 212 of gestation so that the high nutrition (HN) group gained 0. 75 kg/day, whereas the low nutrition (LN) group gained 0. 17 kg/day during mid-gestation. Suckling was suppressed for 7 days by fitting <b>nose</b> <b>plates</b> to 46 -day-old calves in the restricted suckling (RS) group, whereas the normal suckling (NS) group remained as a control. Ultrasound examinations and blood sampling were carried out at weekly intervals from day 18 and day 25 post partum, retrospectively, to evaluate ovarian activity and serum progesterone concentrations. Calf grazing and suckling activity was observed for 3 h per day on 2, 5 and 3 days before, during and after treatment, respectively. Dominant follicles (DF) in the ovaries occurred in all cows by day post partum and underwent a pattern of growth and atresia before first ovulation. Restricted suckling cows had a mean 18 days shorter interval from calving to conception than NS cows (76. 0 [plus or minus] 5 vs 94. 1 [plus or minus] 6 days, P [is less than] 0. 05), whereas genotype and nutritional treatment {{had no effect on}} interval to conception. However, the beneficial effect of suckling restriction on reproductive performance was apparent only in those cows fed a high pasture allowance in mid-gestation and consequently calved in better condition than NS cows. Restricted suckling calves spent more time grazing during the period of attachment of <b>nose</b> <b>plates</b> and differences in behaviour remained over a further 5 days after <b>nose</b> <b>plates</b> were removed (62. 4 [plus or minus] 7 vs 38. 6 [plus or minus] 7 minutes spent grazing; P [is less than] 0. 001), but were lighter at weaning (146. 7 [plus or minus] 3 vs 162. 4 [plus or minus] 3 kg; P [is less than] 0. 01). Despite the lower calf liveweight at weaning it is concluded that manipulation of suckling through fitting <b>nose</b> <b>plates</b> to calves can be successfully used to shorten the interval from calving to conception in primiparous cows fed higher pastures allowances during mid-gestation and consequently calved in better body condition...|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} British {{infantry}} tanks, it was heavily armoured. The front glacis was 78 mm thick, although the <b>nose</b> <b>plates</b> {{top and bottom}} were thinner but angled. The sides of the hull were 65 to 70 mm, and the rear armour, protecting the engine to sides and rear, was 55 mm. The turret armour was 75 mm all round.

50|$|The {{hull of the}} FCM 1A {{was very}} elongated, in order to cross wide trenches. It {{was more or less}} compartmentalised into four sections, that however were not {{separated}} by bulkheads: a relatively short driver compartment at the front, a fighting compartment with a turret at its top, a larger munitions room and finally a large engine compartment at the rear. The last was enlarged at both sides over the tracks, to create room for long rectangular fuel tanks. The front of the hull followed the profile of the tall climbing faces of the tracks and therefore gradually curved upwards, ending in a high, vertical, <b>nose</b> <b>plate.</b> The glacis plate behind it was oriented almost horizontally and connected at its rear to the vertical top front plate of the driver compartment. As the turret ring was larger than the width of the hull, it partly rested on rounded lateral extensions. The turret was a truncated cone with a roof sloping down to the front, so that in side view its profile was wedge-shaped.|$|E
5000|$|Another unusual {{feature is}} the slanted {{overhang}} of the frontal part of the chassis which has {{the form of a}} pointed nose, ending in a high obliquely protruding steel spur. It had been designed for cutting through and crushing down German barbed wire, thus opening passages for following French infantry, originally seen as the primary function of the system. This long overhang could cause the tank to ditch itself readily. The major dimensions of the tank are a length of 6.32 m, a width of 2.05 m and a height of 2.3 m. The design is of the early so-called [...] "box tank" [...] type, in which the crew, propulsion system and all manner of equipment are not clearly separated. As a result, there is no real fighting compartment. The room available to the crew, illuminated by three small electric lights, is entered through a double door {{in the back of the}} tank and is extremely cramped. The crew consisted of a commanding officer who was also the driver; an NCO who was the gunner, two machine gunners, a loader who assisted both the cannon and the machine guns and a mechanic who doubled as a machine gun loader. Four of these six men had, at their assigned position, to crouch inside a 1.5 m high space between the roof and the tank's floor. They then had to stand within two narrow troughs, one, behind the driver's seat, used by the gunner and a second square one more to the back, between the suspension elements, used by the cannon loader and the two machine gunners. Most of the space however, had a height of just three feet between the roof and the covering of transmission and suspension: if the mechanic wanted to assist the right machine gun, he had to lie on his belly to load it. Part of each Schneider tank team were also three embedded riflemen who functioned as a sort of outside crew, during battle directly accompanying the vehicle. All-around protection was provided by 11.4 mm steel plate, later improved by a spaced armour of 5.4/5.5 mm, raising the weight from 12.5 to 13.5 tonnes. The roof had 5.5 mm armour. The plates are partly riveted; the superstructure is largely bolted.The 60 hp Schneider gasoline engine and its radiator are located in the front part of the tank, to the immediate left of the driver. The four cylinder, 135×170 9753 cc, engine is of a type specially constructed for the Schneider CA. It attains its maximum output of sixty horsepower at a thousand rpm.

Steering was generally very tiring and there was a tendency to jump out of gear when the clutch was engaged too forcefully. The tank's official top speed is only 8.1 km/h. Practical terrain speed was even lower at two to four km/h. The first gear at 1000 rpm equals a speed of 2 km/h, the second of 3.95 km/h, the third of 6.75 km/h.

It has a somewhat larger diameter than the idler, causing the upper track profile to slope slightly downwards to the front. The track consists of thirty-three flat links with a width of thirty-six centimetres. The ground pressure is about 0.75 kg/cm².As the traverse of the main gun was limited, it had first to be pointed in the general direction of the target by the driver-commander swivelling the entire vehicle. To facilitate this, a small rectangular frame is fitted on the right side of the nose of the tank. Looking through it, the driver had a sightline parallel to that of the cannon in a neutral position. In practice, the commander had a too limited view of his surroundings through the small hatches to his left, front and right and had to resort to lifting his head out of his rectangular top hatch to observe the enemy. Small rectangular hatches, fitted with a vision slit, are further present to the front of each machine-gun. The main ventilation is provided by a large skylight slit running along the midline of the hull. It is doubly roofed with the lower roof having a second slit in its top, while the higher roof has open lower sides, creating oblique oblong ventilation channels through which fresh air can be sucked in from the outside. The top roof is the highest element of the vehicle. With later production vehicles, polluted air is removed through a broad ventilation grid in the nose, having a recessed armour plate below it. To the left and the right of the skylight roof rectangular escape hatches are present in the hull top.The vehicles were delivered by the factory painted in the standard grey colour used by the Artillery Arm and other branches of the army and that was often called [...] "artillery grey". It was a rather light pearl grey shade. At first, by the Section Camouflage in the field a specially designed complex striped flame pattern was added consisting of narrow vertical red brown, dark green and yellow ochre patches, delineated in black. This was intended to break the contours of the vehicles. To some observers, it made them seem strikingly colourful. The original grey paint was perhaps only partly covered, including it in the ensemble; an alternative interpretation of the lightest patches seen in black-and-white photographs is that it represents a light green hue. Later, when the appliqué armour was added a much simpler scheme was used where the same hues were shown in large irregular areas, again demarcated in black. In the first combat actions, it became clear that German machine gunners concentrated their fire on the vision slits. To confuse them, in the summer of 1917 a cross-hatched scheme of narrow vertical and horizontal dark grey stripes was applied on top of the original patches. The stripes continued over the side machine gun ball mounts but a round area remained untouched to suggest a false position. The individual Schneider CA tanks had serial numbers ranging from 61001 to 61399. The first tactical markings consisted of simple numbers, to distinguish the individual tanks within a training unit. Early 1917 the combat units used small inconspicuous playing-card symbols, each symbol indicating one of four batteries within a groupe. These were sprayed in white on the tank side, often combined with an individual tank number, depending on the style each groupe preferred. The tank number could also be indicated on the tank spur, by horizontal stripes.|$|E

5000|$|The Char D1's Renault FT ancestry {{can still}} {{be seen from the}} sloping engine deck and the profile of the side armour plates; it is also still a rather narrow vehicle, only 2.16 metre wide. Its length is 5.76 metre with tail. The riveted hull armour is thirty mm thick on all {{vertical}} surfaces, ten mm on top and bottom. The NC31 introduced a 10 mm protection plate for the suspension units; the lower hull side armour beneath it was probably 16 or 25 mm thick — the exact data have been lost. For its time the Char D1 was relatively well armoured; as a result the hull alone weighs 11 metric tons, rather heavier than a typical light tank of the period. A 74 hp V-4 engine of 6.08 litre renders a top speed of 18.6 km/h; the range is ninety kilometres; it can climb a 110 cm obstacle and a 50% slope, cross a 220 cm trench and wade through 90 cm of water. The type thus had a relatively good mobility for the early thirties. In the hull are two crew members. The first is the driver who, as with the Renault FT, is seated below large double hatches that form the <b>nose</b> <b>plates.</b> He can operate, via a steel cable, a fixed 7.5 mm Reibel machine gun low in the nose, that is almost completely hidden behind the armour. The second crew member operates the radio set {{on the right side of}} the fighting compartment, the set being an ER (Émetteur-Récepteur or [...] "emitter-receiver") 51 for the NC31s and an ER52 or 53 for the series vehicles. At the right of the engine deck a very distinctive and robust radio antenna frame is fitted, its point the highest of the vehicle at 2.4 metres. It impedes a full rotation of the turret to the right, limiting the total movement to about 345°. The radio operator also assists in the loading of the gun, by handing over rounds taken from the munition load of 76 to the third crew member, the commander, located in the turret.|$|R

The measurements disclosed that the highest lift attained with a single-hinged nose cannot be increased by a double-hinged nose. The sum of the deflection angles of both hinged noses related to the maximum lift is about equal to the corresponding angle of the single-hinge nose (approx. 30 deg to 40).

A miniature dynamic pressure transducer, Kulite model XCS- 062 - 5 D, was utilized to measure the total pressure fluctuations, and was integrated with an autonomous boundary layer measurement device that can withstand flight test conditions. Various sensor-probe configurations of the Kulite pressure transducer were first examined in a wind tunnel with a 0. 610 m (2. 0 ft) square test section with a maximum operational velocity of 49. 2 m/s (110 mph), corresponding dynamic pressure of 1. 44 kPa (30 psf). The Kulite sensor was placed on an elliptical <b>nose</b> flat <b>plate</b> where the flow was known to be turbulent. The Kulite sensor was then evaluated to measure total pressure fluctuations in laminar, turbulent, and transition of boundary layers developed on the flat plate in the same wind tunnel. The root-mean-square value of total pressure fluctuations was less than 1 % of the local free-stream dynamic pressure in the laminar boundary layer, but was about 2 % in the turbulent boundary layer. The value increased to 4 % in transition, indicating that the total pressure fluctuation measurements can be used not only to distinguish the laminar boundary layer from the turbulent boundary layer, but also to identify the transition region. The unsteady total pressure measurement was also conducted in a with a 2. 13 m (7. 0 ft) by 3. 05 m (10. 0 ft) section with similar operational velocity range as the previous wind tunnel. The Kulite sensor was placed on a wing model under laminar and transition conditions. The testing yielded similar results, demonstrating the usefulness of total pressure measurement for identifying the laminar-to-turbulent transition...|$|R

The plate is 2 m long, 0. 8 m high and 8 cm thick. The measurements were performed in velocity range from 15 to 60 m/s. A sand paper turbulizer was placed close to the <b>plate</b> <b>nose</b> to provide fully developed turbulent boundary layer over the most part of the plate. Strain balances were mounted in the trailing part of the plate to measure the skin friction drag over removable insertions of 0. 55 × 0. 25 m 2 size. A set of the insertions was designed and manufactured: 3 mm thick polished metal surface and three compliant surfaces. The compliant surfaces were manufactured of a silicone rubber Silastic ® S 2 (Dow Corning company). To modify the viscoelastic properties of the rubber, its composition was varied: 90 % of the rubber + 10 % catalyst (standard), 92. 5 % + 7. 5 % (weak), 85 % + 15 % (strong).

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The primary objective of this work is to experimentally {{examine the effect of}} various geometric parameters on the impact damage and damage tolerance of thin carbon/epoxy plate and panel structures. Due to the number of parameters involved in a low velocity impact event and the complexity of the damage created, determining what effect individual parameters have is extremely demanding, especially when some of the parameters may even be coupled. However, by experimentally simulating in a controlled manner, either the impact event or the damage created, the effect of individual geometric parameters can be isolated and determined. A quasi-static indentation test has been used to simulate an impact event. The parameters of indenter size, <b>nose</b> shape, <b>plate</b> size and boundary condition, were examined. Four different plate failure modes were identified. Indenter nose shape was found to be the dominant geometric parameter, as a change in nose shape resulted in a change in failure mode and hence maximum load. From this work, a set of geometric parameters was selected for impact testing. Impact testing at various Incident Kinetic Energies (IKE) was performed on an instrumented drop weight impact rig. From examination of internal and external damage, the development of damage to increasing IKE was determined and shown to have four distinctive phases. Coupled with strike and rebound velocity measurementsa, non-linear relationship between IKE-damage area was established and a delamination threshold energy level of 1. 1 J was calculated. Damaget olerance assessmenot f impacted panels was then performed in a Compression-After- Impact (CAI) rig. Strain gauge responses allowed global and local behaviour to be compared to intact specimens. It was found that once a critical damage size was surpassed, a gradual nonlinear degradation in compressive strength was observed until a point was reached where no further degradation in performance was attained. Furthermore, propagation of internal damage in a stable and unstable manner was directly linked to the nature of sublaminate buckling behaviour. Damaget olerance assessmenot f artificially delaminatedp anels loaded in compressionw as then performed. A single artificial delamination of various size, shape and orientation, embedded at the centre of a panel was examined. Delamination width was found to be the dominant geometric parameter. Hence, when comparing a circular delamination to an elliptical one of the same area, the effect of orientation and shape is aspect ratio dependent. Finally, a comparison of impacted and artificially delaminated panels was made...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the first}} twenty {{years as an}} {{independent}} country of Panama, the Kuna had serious differences with national governments, because they tried to eradicate their culture, their customs and their disrespect indigenous authorities wanted to strip the land apart and were outraged by the governors and the colonial police (a settler to a native, is a non-Indian).This is linked to an incident on April 20, 1921, which was staged in the Heart of Jesus Narganá and Westernization movement for women, which was to change clothes, take away the gold ring of the <b>nose,</b> the <b>plates</b> high carat gold, beads, winks and coin necklaces worn ornaments. But a woman escaped and fled to Rio Narganá Sugar, from which it came. The police in retaliation remained imprisoned his children and his son, who was released to the outside to look.That day at Sugar River had an indigenous congress {{and there it was}} decided not to let the woman go, so the sahila on behalf of the community sent a message saying that the police were not looking for it. The police did not heed the message that night and sent a commission to Rio Colonial Sugar two police officers and three Indians. When trying to stop some of the male relatives of women, began the battle and killed three residents of the town, two Indian policemen and others were injured with machete wildly as they fled in a canoe. The bodies of the policemen were left in the water, tied to a stick in the sand enlcavado until they came to collect their families.The atmosphere remained tense until January 1925. Juan Demosthenes Arosemena was the governor of the province of Colon, and was concerned about the information he had supplied the mayor of San Blas, Andrés Mojica, on a course between the indigenous independence movement, so we decided to tell the Foreign Secretary Horacio F. Alfaro, to follow closely the actions of Americans: Anne Coope missionary and explorer Richard Oglesby Marsh.Just Marsh was the promoter of the [...] "independence". On his return to Panama in January 1925, found a conflict between police and indigenous to explode, so he asked the U.S. military intervention in the Canal Zone, to exercise a protectorate, and wrote the Declaration of Independence and Tule people's human rights and Darién. Marsh was supported by the U.S. ambassador, who helped the Panamanian government signed a peace agreement that would guarantee human rights and political rights of gunas.|$|R
