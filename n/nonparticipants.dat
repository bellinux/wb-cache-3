In other words, households facing the greatest hardships are the most likely to bear of the burden of applying for program benefits. Statistical models that control for this endogeneity suggest that SNAP receipt reduces the likelihood of being food insecure and very food insecure by roughly 30 percent and 20 percent, respectively.|$|E
30|$|Additionally, {{the idea}} that {{innovation}} is contagious should further be explored. It was quite unexpected and surprising {{to think that the}} participating group’s excitement and engagement for innovation was contagious to the <b>nonparticipant</b> group. This study was designed and structured more for measuring changes in group-level innovativeness, rather than the psychological factors influencing a <b>nonparticipant</b> group. It would be an interesting study to measure more precisely how the <b>nonparticipant</b> group learned what they did. There are many explanations: maybe the <b>nonparticipant</b> group merely learned how they wanted (from their colleagues) or that the participant group has so much influence over the organization that the <b>nonparticipant</b> group did not have a choice. Regardless, the finding was surprising and worth exploring further.|$|R
30|$|One {{possible}} explanation for the <b>nonparticipant</b> group’s significance is that the participant group members contacted a number of <b>nonparticipant</b> group members and were able to educate them on innovation strategy. Participation in the formal innovation training was voluntary; the <b>nonparticipant</b> group members chose not to join. However, in the end, they learned anyways. It is difficult to understand how this learning came about, whether it was the <b>nonparticipant</b> group that eventually decided for themselves that they were ready to learn or whether the participant group had such a strong influence on the organization or <b>nonparticipant</b> group that they prevailed. Alternatively, the <b>nonparticipant</b> group members could have experienced a feeling of being “left out” and thus become competitive and tried to do well on the assessments. According to this study’s measures, it seems most likely that the participant group’s engagement or enthusiasm for innovation was contagious to the <b>nonparticipant</b> group. There is a body of organizational literature that supports the proposition that engagement is highly contagious and transferrable to other members of an organization (Barrick, Thurgood, Smith, & Courtright, 2015; Pugh, 2001). However, this current study did not have these express measures in place to measure this issue accurately. For the aforementioned reasons, this phenomenon of an engaged or enthusiastic group influencing other nonparticipating members with their positive attitude to improve group or organizational innovativeness should be further explored.|$|R
30|$|Innovation {{literature}} {{could benefit}} significantly {{by increasing the}} sample size, monitoring a longer duration, studying three groups (participant group, <b>nonparticipant</b> group, and a group combining participant and <b>nonparticipant</b> members), and expanding the study to different industries. This would likely shed more light unto the impact and transferability that formal innovation training has on both group- and organizational-level innovativeness.|$|R

30|$|An {{innovation}} {{intervention was}} conducted. Data was collected from 40 health care practitioners (N[*]=[*] 40), from a publicly owned retirement home {{located in a}} rural part of Trøndelag, in Norway. The practitioners {{were divided into two}} groups, the participant group (N[*]=[*] 15) and the <b>nonparticipant</b> group (N[*]=[*] 25). The participant group will be participating in a formal innovation education, while the <b>nonparticipant</b> group will be conducting business as usual or maintaining status quo. Both groups are comprised of a unit leader, registered nurses, nursing assistants, and others. Participation in the formal innovation training was voluntary, meaning, the <b>nonparticipant</b> group members chose not to join.|$|R

30|$|After {{negotiations}} with management, {{it was determined}} that the municipality would allow 20 of their employees to participate in four, 2 -h formal innovation training sessions. Management explained that this was all that was economically possible. If their employees are participating in the program, their wages need to be paid for that time; additionally, the municipality will need to find and pay for replacements for those shifts. The municipality solicited interest from their employees. For this reason, the study was broken into two groups: the participant group and the <b>nonparticipant</b> group. The participant group included those that volunteered to participate in the study, while the <b>nonparticipant</b> group included those employees that chose not to participate. It {{is important to note that}} the <b>nonparticipant</b> group is not a control group. The <b>nonparticipant</b> group did not know the content of the intervention, but they knew of the intervention’s existence and willingly chose not to participate, thus shaping their attitudes prior to any measurements being taken. In actuality, we have two participant groups: one (the participant) group that chose to participate in the study and the other (the <b>nonparticipant)</b> group that chose not to participate. Prior to the intervention, both groups differed in their attitude towards the treatment. In this study, the organization as a whole is the combination of these two groups.|$|R

30|$|Fourth, {{innovative}} readiness {{can be used}} {{to predict}} or predetermine if a group of participants are ready for innovative change. Prior to the intervention, both the participant group and <b>nonparticipant</b> group were classified in terms of their innovative readiness, based on their group climate (Schultz et al., 2017). It was determined that the participant group showed signs of innovative readiness for change, while the <b>nonparticipant</b> group did not (Schultz et al., 2017). This study confirmed this prediction for the participant group in Table  1. Table  1 shows that the participating group significantly improved their understanding of innovation (p[*]<[*] 0.001) in the innovation phase they were taught, and this led to organization-wide innovations in Table  2. When Tables  1 and 2 are viewed together, they confirm that the participating group’s innovative readiness was in fact a positive indicator of their successful participation in the innovation initiative. However, it was also predicted that the nonparticipating group was not ready for innovative change, but Table  1 presumably shows that this group did in fact change. This study did not have the appropriate measures in place to determine accurately how the <b>nonparticipant</b> group did in fact learn, even though they did not participate in any training. It seems plausible from Table  1 that the control question (C) {{and the extent to which}} the participant group interacted with the <b>nonparticipant</b> group about what they learned from the intervention could have triggered this change for the <b>nonparticipant</b> group. If this were the case, it would not contradict the validity of innovative readiness. It would merely provide an explanation for an unexpected outcome. In this case, that one group’s positive attitude was so strong that it convinced a group to be ready for innovation, even though they previously were not. Looking to group climate to predetermine innovative readiness for change was supported by H 6 for the participant group, but H 6 was inconclusive for <b>nonparticipant</b> group (Table  3).|$|R
30|$|First, {{formalization}} has {{a positive}} effect on group-level innovativeness. Prior to any innovation training, both the participant group and <b>nonparticipant</b> group had a relatively similar understanding of innovation (Schultz et al., 2017). This meant that neither group had statistical significance or advantage in their understanding of innovation prior to any training. However, after the participant group completed their formal training on innovation strategy, both the participant group and the <b>nonparticipant</b> group improved their understanding of innovation strategy significantly, thus supporting H 1 (Table  3).|$|R
30|$|Prior to {{any formal}} training, both groups {{completed}} the first questionnaire. From the participant group, 15 of 15 (100 %) {{responded to the}} questionnaire sufficiently. The response rate was likely so high as the questionnaire was completed {{at the start of}} the first innovation training course. From the <b>nonparticipant</b> group, 22 of 25 (88 %) were sufficiently completed. The response rate could have been lower because the questionnaire was sent electronically, from the manager to the employees, and the questionnaire was completed on their own time. At the conclusion of the innovation course, 10 of 15 (67 %) questionnaires were sufficiently completed from the participant group, while the <b>nonparticipant</b> group completed 12 of 25 (48 %) sufficiently. The second questionnaire for each group was completed in the same manner as the first questionnaire. The participant group completed their second questionnaire at the conclusion of the last innovation training course, while the <b>nonparticipant</b> group completed an electronic questionnaire on their own time.|$|R

50|$|A {{qualifying}} puzzle ran in Games Magazine. Solvers of {{the puzzle}} could decide whether {{they wanted to be}} <b>Nonparticipants</b> or Participants. <b>Nonparticipants</b> with correct solutions were eligible for a random drawing, the winner of which would receive a cash prize. Participants with correct solutions were mailed four very difficult tiebreaker crosswords, many of which had deliberately tricky crossings and unannounced gimmicks (for example, the long entries in a puzzle might reveal that all of the across clues were in reverse order). The 250 solvers with the best scores on the tiebreak puzzles were invited to New York City to participate in the tournament.|$|E
5000|$|Studies {{comparing}} NSLP {{participants and}} <b>nonparticipants</b> have been inconclusive on whether weight gain rates differ {{between the two}} groups. The 2008 Economic Research Service study found [...] "similar calorie intakes for participants and <b>nonparticipants</b> but higher fat and sodium intakes for participants". The most obvious challenge to efforts to address such problems is that even if more nutritious foods are provided, {{there is no guarantee}} that students will eat them. Additionally, the NSLP does not take into account the physiological differences among participants: Some children are smaller than others, some are more athletic, and some have metabolisms that require more calories than the NSLP allows.|$|E
30|$|Additionally, {{the study}} showed that the formal {{innovation}} training had {{a positive impact on}} the <b>nonparticipant</b> group’s understanding of innovation strategy (p[*]<[*] 0.05), thus supporting H 1, but not H 2 (Table  3). This was odd. Members from this group were given the opportunity to join the innovation training, but they willingly chose not to participate. This group prioritized status quo or continuing business as usual, rather than participating in the training. Despite this lack of interest in the innovation training, their statistical significance in innovation strategy, illustrated in Table  1, indicated they learned from the training anyways. The <b>nonparticipant</b> group’s significance was difficult to understand when looking solely to their group’s data. However, when the <b>nonparticipant</b> group’s data was viewed in light of the participating group’s data and work climate, an explanation emerged. It﻿ seems the participating group's work climate as contagious to the nonparticipating group. The impact this had at the group level will be elaborated on below.|$|R
30|$|Second, {{formalization}} has {{a positive}} effect on organizational-level innovativeness. There were two indications that formalization affected the organizational-level innovativeness. First, Table  1 shows that the <b>nonparticipant</b> group has statistical significance (p[*]<[*] 0.05) in the innovation strategy phase, the same phase the participant group was taught. Here both groups, the participant and <b>nonparticipant</b> group, experienced statistical significance in the same phase. The combination of these two groups comprised the organization in this study. Meaning, learning reached the organizational level. This is fairly convincing evidence, as the <b>nonparticipant</b> group had no idea on which phase the participant group was participating in and could not determine which questions were associated with each phase on the questionnaire, and still, the <b>nonparticipant</b> group was only significant in one of the four phases on the questionnaire. If either group (the participant group or the <b>nonparticipant</b> group) really did not learn, and merely thought they were more innovative, more phases would have had significance. It is possible that this significance for both groups is a coincidence. However, when the evidence from Table  1 is viewed together with Table  2, the findings support the positive relationship for organizational-level innovativeness. Table  2 is an illustration of the qualitative data gathered from the management. Table  2 explains the ideas that emerged {{as a result of the}} formalization and the extent to which each idea was implemented within the organization. Table  2 shows that eight ideas emerged as a result of the training, seven ideas were further developed, and ideas 2, 5, and 7 were discussed, implemented, and diffused within the organization. Thus, formalization was positively related to organizational-level innovation as three new ideas were developed, implemented, and diffused within the organization, which supported H 5 (Table  3).|$|R

This cycle {{is very similar to}} the cycle given by evolutionary dynamics e. g. replicator dynamics. The mechanism that <b>nonparticipant</b> can sustain cooperation is driven by the Rock-Paper-Scissors type of cyclic dominance in the three strategies. That is, if the cycle is existent, the cooperation will always sustain. Meanwhile, the distribution of social states changes in the state space and from cooperation as the most frequent strategy to defection and, from defection to <b>nonparticipant,</b> forms a clear rotation path in a long run. These results seem to implicate that the evolutionary dynamics has ability to capture the real dynamics applying not only on biosphere, but also on human society...|$|R

30|$|Lastly, {{innovative}} readiness {{needs to}} be further developed.
