5|$|The premaxillary bones {{each house}} a single incisor, {{which is located}} at the front tip. They end in a V shape at the front margin and in a <b>narrow</b> <b>point</b> at the back margin. Inside each premaxilla is a large opening, the {{anterior}} palatal foramen. The maxillary bone contains the other upper teeth. The mandible ranges from thin to robust and houses the lower teeth.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day as Wedel arrived, 20 July, Saltykov {{established}} himself astride the Prussian communication line at the Oder, strengthening his already formidable position. This effectively cut any Prussian advance or reinforcement from Crossen (Krosno) or Frankfurt on the Oder. At this point, the Russians occupied the heights by Kay and additional high ground by Mosau (Mozów). A stream, the Eichmühlen Fliess, flowed in a swampy depression just to the east of the town. It could be crossed only at a single <b>narrow</b> <b>point</b> on the road east of Kay, directly opposite the Russian center; a second crossing could be made immediately south of Kay, which would permit an assault on the Russian right flank. This seemed reasonable to Wedel, but only if the Russians were not fully deployed.|$|E
5|$|The eight {{arms are}} thick, {{tapering}} to a <b>narrow</b> <b>point.</b> They are unequal in length, with arm pair I the shortest, followed by arm pair II and arm pair IV, and arm pair III the longest. All of them possess {{two rows of}} suckers. Each sucker has a diameter less than , decreasing distally, and a ring of 17 to 28 sharp acute teeth. The left arm of pair IV in males is modified into a sexual organ known as the hectocotylus. They bear long fleshy protrusions (papillae) with toothless suckers at the distal portion. The tentacles are thick and long, extending {{the length of the}} mantle when retracted. They are slightly compressed laterally. A prominent ridge (a keel) is present on the outer surface of each of the tentacle clubs (the wide tip of the tentacles). There are four rows of suckers on the manus (proximal part of the club) and the dactylus (distal part of the club). The larger suckers in the centre of the manus have 17 to 18 widely spaced teeth.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} is well detailed and executed with dark stained timber joinery throughout, {{except for the}} contrasting honey-coloured boards that line the raked ceiling. Finely detailed trusses, supported on concrete corbels, incorporate semi-circular laminated arches of three vertical layers, bolted and strapped together at intervals. Within the semi-circular apse, the ceiling boards are tapered to a <b>narrow</b> <b>point</b> to form a conical peak. Decorative timber grilles along {{the apex of the}} nave and chancel ceiling combined with metal grilles in the chancel window sills are elements of the original ventilation system.|$|E
25|$|In December 1950, after Chinese PLA troops blew up {{a bridge}} at a <b>narrow</b> <b>point</b> on the {{evacuation}} route between Koto-ri and Hungnam, blocking {{the withdrawal of}} U.N. forces, eight U.S. Air Force C-119 Flying Boxcars flown by the 314th Troop Carrier Group. were used to drop portable bridge sections by parachute. The bridge, consisting of eight separate sixteen-foot long, 2,900-pound sections, was dropped one section at a time, using two parachutes on each section. Four of these sections, together with additional wooden extensions were successfully reassembled into a replacement bridge by Marine Corps combat engineers and the US Army 58th Engineer Treadway Bridge Company, enabling U.N. forces to reach Hungnam.|$|E
25|$|Spain ceded Florida to the British in 1763 {{after the}} French and Indian War, and the British soon {{constructed}} the King's Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia. The road crossed the St. Johns River at a <b>narrow</b> <b>point,</b> which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British called the Cow Ford; these names ostensibly {{reflect the fact}} that cattle were brought across the river there. The British introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits, as well the export of lumber. As a result, the northeastern Florida area prospered economically more than it had under the Spanish. Britain ceded control of the territory to Spain in 1783, after being defeated in the American Revolutionary War, and the settlement at the Cow Ford continued to grow. After Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821, American settlers {{on the north side of}} the Cow Ford decided to plan a town, laying out the streets and plats. They soon named the town Jacksonville, after Andrew Jackson. Led by Isaiah D. Hart, residents wrote a charter for a town government, which was approved by the Florida Legislative Council on February 9, 1832.|$|E

2500|$|World War II saw a {{resurgence}} of the stiletto {{in the form of}} combat knives for commando raiding forces and other troops who needed a weapon for silent killing. [...] In late 1940, the famed British hand-to-hand combat instructors William E. Fairbairn and Eric A. Sykes designed the Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife, a double-edged dagger with a long <b>narrow</b> <b>point</b> designed to optimize the blade for thrusting, though it was also capable of slashing strokes if the cutting edges were sharpened.|$|E
2500|$|A scimitar antenna is a radio antenna {{so named}} because its shape resembles a talon-shaped curved sword of the same name. [...] It was invented in 1958 by Edwin M. and William P. Turner.

2500|$|The {{individual}} Companion cavalry squadron {{was usually}} deployed in a wedge formation, which facilitated both manoeuvrability and {{the shock of}} the charge. The advantage of the wedge was that it offered a <b>narrow</b> <b>point</b> for piercing enemy formations and concentrated the leaders at the front. It was easier to turn than a square formation because everyone followed the leader at the apex, [...] "like a flight of cranes". Philip II introduced the formation, probably in emulation of Thracian and Scythian cavalry, though the example of the rhomboid formation adopted by Macedon's southern neighbours, the Thessalians, must also have had some effect.|$|E
2500|$|The 1808 {{building}} cost £8,000, which {{was regarded as}} an enormous sum for those days and was perhaps as controversial as the administrative building Bernard Weatherill House opened for occupation in 2013 and reputed to have cost £220,000,000. The early 19th century building was known initially as [...] "Courthouse" [...] as, like its predecessor and successor, the local court met there. The building stood {{on the western side}} of the High Street near to the junction with Surrey Street, the location of the town's market. The building became inadequate for the growing local administrative responsibilities and stood at a <b>narrow</b> <b>point</b> of a High Street in need of widening.|$|E

The city has a traditional grid that generally radiates toward the points of the compass, though a correction to more accuracy {{in relation to the}} compass just east of the older downtown and residential area is noticeable. [...] Most post-1970 houses were built in formerly clearcut forested areas.|$|E
2500|$|In 1763, Spain traded Florida to the Kingdom of Great Britain {{for control}} of Havana, Cuba, which had been {{captured}} by the British during the Seven Years' War. It {{was part of a}} large expansion of British territory following their victory in the Seven Years' War. A large portion of the Floridano population left, taking along most of the remaining indigenous population to Cuba. [...] The British soon constructed the King's Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia.

2500|$|The first European {{to record}} Point Arena was Spaniard Bartolomé Ferrer in 1543, who named it Cabo de Fortunas (Spanish for [...] "cape of fortunes").

Later the point, and the small harbor town south of it, were called Barra de Arena (i.e. sandbar) and finally Point Arena (literally [...] "sand point"). [...] Point Arena is a narrow peninsula jutting around 1/2 mile (800 m) into the Pacific Ocean. This sandbar creates a natural hazard to navigation, and hence the need for a lighthouse and fog signal here.|$|E

The Jacksonville Beaches communities are along the adjacent Atlantic coast. The area was originally inhabited by the Timucua people, and in 1564 was the site of the French colony of Fort Caroline, one of the earliest European settlements in what is now the continental United States. Under British rule, settlement grew at the <b>narrow</b> <b>point</b> in the river where cattle crossed, known as Wacca Pilatka to the Seminole and the Cow Ford to the British. A platted town was established there in 1822, a year after the United States gained Florida from Spain; it was named after Andrew Jackson, the first military governor of the Florida Territory and seventh President of the United States.|$|E
