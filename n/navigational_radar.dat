40|$|<b>Navigational</b> <b>radars</b> {{are used}} to detect and {{continuously}} track a number of aircraft. In strongly cluttered environment, {{this can lead to}} broken and interrupted tracks. This could be hazardous specially in the terminal areas and approach corridors. Hence the optimum rejection of clutter is a primary requirement in <b>navigational</b> <b>radars.</b> This paper describes a method to combat arbitrary delay-Doppler clutter. The problem is approached via the signal ambiguity function. Matched filter receiver is assumed and transmitted signal parameters are optimized to achieve the clutter rejection capability. The signal set chosen is the family of frequency coded constant amplitude pulse bursts, and a criterion function is derived in terms of the frequencies of individual subpulses which has been optimized for a variety of clutter distributions. The results obtained clearly bring out the effectiveness of the method...|$|R
25|$|During 2014, Anzac was {{the third}} ship of the class to undergo the Anti-Ship Missile Defence (ASMD) upgrade. The upgrade {{occurred}} across 2014 and early 2015, the upgrade included the fitting of CEA Technologies' CEAFAR and CEAMOUNT phased array radars, on new masts, a Vampir NG Infrared Search and Track system, and Sharpeye <b>Navigational</b> <b>Radar</b> Systems, along with improvements to the operations room equipment and layout.|$|E
25|$|Rivet Clamp {{installation}} {{began with}} four STARS-equipped C-130s completed by March 1966, followed by installations in eight further aircraft in July 1966 and January 1967. The Rivet Clamps, originally designated C-130E(I), were {{equipped with an}} electronic and infrared (IR) countermeasures suite; and the AN/APQ-115 <b>navigational</b> <b>radar.</b> This radar, adapted from the Texas Instruments AN/APQ-89 radar used in the RF-4C Phantom photo reconnaissance aircraft, featured terrain following/terrain-avoidance (TF/TA), Doppler, and mapping radar modes, to enable it to operate at low altitudes at night and in all weather conditions and avoid known enemy radar and anti-aircraft weapons concentrations.|$|E
25|$|The radar suite {{includes}} a Raytheon SPS-49(V)8 ANZ radar for aerial search and long-range surveillance, a Saab 9LV 453 Target Indication Radar for air and surface search, an Atlas Elektronik 9600 ARPA <b>navigational</b> <b>radar,</b> {{and a second}} Saab 9LV 453 unit for fire control. All ships were initially fitted with a ThomsonSintra Spherion B hull-mounted bow sonar, for active search and attack operations. From Warramunga onwards, ships were launched with a Petrel Mine and Obstacle Avoidance Sonar system. this was later retrofitted to Anzac. All ships were fitted for but not with a towed-array sonar, with the RAN and RNZN following separate acquisition programs for these. The frigates were also fitted for but not with SATCOM and a Helo datalink.|$|E
50|$|The {{systems in}} Monge allow the vessel to track {{missiles}} and satellites. There are two <b>navigational</b> <b>radars</b> and a DRBV 15C air surveillance radar installed.

25|$|A major {{modification}} between 1986 and 1994, MOD-90, modernized {{the capability}} and serviceability of the Talon I {{to extend its}} service life. All 14 Combat Talon I's were equipped with upgraded <b>navigational</b> <b>radars,</b> an enhanced electronic warfare suite and provided new outer wings. By 1995 all Combat Talon Is were equipped with a helicopter-air refueling pods.|$|R
25|$|The RAN {{commenced}} {{plans to}} improve their frigates' combat capability in 1996, with the Warfighting Improvement Program (WIP). Upgrades proposed under the WIP included installation of a phased-array radar, a second Mark 41 vertical launch system. The WIP was scrapped {{near the end of}} 1999, and plans for a less ambitious anti-ship missile defence (ASMD) upgrade were made. In 2004, Tenix, Saab, and the Department of Defence formed a Private Public Partnership to upgrade the anti-ship missile defence (ASMD) capability of the Anzac class, through the installation of CEA Technologies' CEAFAR and CEAMOUNT phased array radars, a Vampir NG Infrared Search and Track system, and Sharpeye <b>Navigational</b> <b>Radar</b> Systems. On 18 January 2010, Perth docked at the Australian Marine Complex in Henderson, Western Australia for the ASMD upgrade. Both of the frigate's masts were replaced, and the operations room layout was improved. Additional ballast was required to maintain stability, and the combined weight increase brought the ship's full load displacement to 3,810 tons. After completion in October 2010, Perth was used to test the modifications, with trials completed in July 2011. Approval to upgrade the other seven RAN Anzacs was granted in November 2011, with work on the A$650 million refits to begin in 2012. As of March 2017, all eight ships of the RAN had completed the upgrade.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of her}} {{conversion}} to a survey ship in 1949â€“50, the ship was disarmed and her interior was extensively reworked to improve her endurance and accommodations.

The changes increased her displacement to [...] at standard and [...] at deep load. Her crew now consisted of 82 officers and ratings.|$|E
500|$|It was recommissioned as Velebit in 1996. According to the 2007 {{edition of}} The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, Velebit was {{fitted with a}} STN-Atlas Elektronik PP-10 active and PSU-1-2 passive sonar and a {{portable}} <b>navigational</b> <b>radar</b> {{may have been used}} on board along with the GPS. The claim is contradicted by other sources with news reports stating the submarine was completed without an active sonar, effectively being [...] "blind" [...] underwater. During the 1990s Velebit had the pennant number [...] "3" [...] painted on its side. After the existing battery set needed for underwater propulsion expired and needed replacement, crew training and boat operations were limited to surface drives.|$|E
50|$|The Kresta II {{class were}} {{equipped}} with MR600 air search radar MR-310 Angara Don navigational and Volga <b>navigational</b> <b>radars.</b> For anti-submarine warfare they had MG-322 hull mounted sonar.

500|$|Around {{the same}} time in Missouris [...] Combat Information Center (CIC) crew members manning the battleship's <b>navigational</b> <b>radar</b> system noticed that the radar returns {{indicated}} that Missouri was steaming for dangerous waters; however, the CIC crew did not report this information to the captain. Lieutenant John Carr, the officer on duty in the CIC {{at the time of the}} grounding, concluded that the radar equipment was likely not operating correctly. Carr later explained the decision not to report the radar information by stating, [...] "the standard practice on board ship did not call for radar advice to the bridge in the absence of specific requests." [...] He also pointed out that the fathometer, a water depth-reading instrument, was out of order and had not been repaired in the yard.|$|E
500|$|The {{solution}} was to fly lower: since radar operates in line-of-sight, detection of an aircraft flying at low altitudes is significantly hindered, thereby reducing time for enemy counter measures. In practice, trees, hills, valleys and any other obstructions reduce this range even more, making a ground-based interception extremely difficult. The Canberra was designed for medium- to high-altitude flight and was not suitable for continuous terrain-hugging flight; this would require a completely different aircraft. Low-level strike aircraft, or [...] "interdictors", grew into {{a new class of}} their own during the late 1950s. They generally featured high wing loading to reduce the effects of turbulence and cross-wind, some form of high-performance <b>navigational</b> <b>radar</b> to allow very low flight at high speeds, and large fuel loads to offset the higher fuel use at low altitudes.|$|E

2500|$|In 1983, MAC {{established}} a Special Operations Force Master Plan {{that called for}} 21 Combat Talon IIs, including two attrition backups, with initial operational capability {{in the third quarter}} of 1987 and full delivery by 1991. The first Combat Talon II, 83-1212, was delivered in June 1984, but an earlier decision by USAF not to equip it with the <b>navigational</b> <b>radar</b> suite of the MC-130E slowed its development for years. In the meantime, Initiative 17, part of the [...] "31 Initiatives" [...] agreement between the Army and Air Force in May 1984, was deferred later that year (and eventually killed) after objections from members of Congress who saw it as a divestiture of the SOF role by the Air Force. As a result, the Air Force cut procurement of new HH-60D Nighthawk combat rescue aircraft from its budget requests â€” further delaying the Combat Talon II program, whose glass cockpit and integrated avionics systems were tied, for cost reasons, to those of the HH-60D.|$|E
