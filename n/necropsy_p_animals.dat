40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to observe possible interactions between the renin-angiotensin and nitrergic systems in chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension in newborn piglets. Thirteen chronically instrumented newborn piglets (6. 3 +/- 0. 9 days; 2369 +/- 491 g) were randomly assigned to receive saline (placebo, P) or the AT(1) receptor (AT(1) -R) blocker L- 158, 809 (L) during 6 days of hypoxia (FiO(2) = 0. 12). During hypoxia, pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa; P < 0. 0001), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR; P < 0. 02) and the pulmonary to systemic vascular resistance ratio (PVR/SVR; P < 0. 05) were significantly attenuated in the L (N = 7) group compared to the P group (N = 6). Western blot analysis of lung proteins showed a significant decrease of endothelial NOS (eNOS) in both <b>P</b> and L <b>animals,</b> and of AT(1) -R in <b>P</b> <b>animals</b> during hypoxia compared to normoxic animals (C group, N = 5; P < 0. 01 for all groups). AT(1) -R tended to decrease in L animals. Inducible NOS (iNOS) did not differ among P, L, and C animals and iNOS immunohistochemical staining in macrophages was significantly more intense in L than in <b>P</b> <b>animals</b> (<b>P</b> < 0. 01). The vascular endothelium showed moderate or strong eNOS and AT(1) -R staining. Macrophages and pneumocytes showed moderate or strong iNOS and AT(1) -R staining, but C animals showed weak iNOS and AT(1) -R staining. Macrophages of L and <b>P</b> <b>animals</b> showed moderate and weak AT(2) -R staining, respectively, but the endothelium of all groups only showed weak staining. In conclusion, pulmonary hypertension induced by chronic hypoxia in newborn piglets is partially attenuated by AT(1) -R blockade.

40|$|Abstract Background We {{sought to}} develop a model of bacterially induced preterm {{delivery}} in rats to parallel similar models in mice. Methods Female Sprague-Dawley rats on day 17 of gestation (normal term = 21 – 22 days) were inoculated into the uterus with either 2 × 10 9 – 7 × 10 10 killed E. coli organisms, 1 – 4 × 10 8 live E. coli or sterile solution. These inoculations were made either via trans-cervical catheter or by direct intrauterine injection at laparotomy. Animals were then observed for delivery for variable periods up to term. Necropsies were performed and fetal viability was assessed. Results No rats delivered prematurely after bacterial exposure (27 animals observed for at least 48 hours), and all animals followed to term (n = 3) delivered live pups. No dams exhibited signs of systemic illness. There was a statistically significant but small negative effect of killed E. coli on fetal viability (100 % of 80 fetuses from 6 control pregnancies and 93 % of 182 fetuses from 14 bacterially-treated pregnancies were alive at <b>necropsy,</b> <b>p</b> = 0. 014). Live bacteria had a larger effect on fetal viability, with only 64 % of 14 fetuses, 47 % of 28 fetuses and 32 % of 31 fetuses surviving after trans-cervical administration of 7 × 10 7, 2 × 10 8 and 4 × 10 8 E. coli, respectively.

Willis-Mollay and Sedimentation methods indicated Ancylostoma spp. eggs in 87. 8 % (29 / 33) dogs and 94. 2 % (49 / 52) cats. The species A. caninum and A. braziliense were found in 63. 6 % (21 / 33) and 30. 3 % (10 / 33) of dogs, respectively. Considering cats, 67. 3 % (35 / 52) were parasitized by A. braziliense, 21. 1 % (11 / 52) by A. caninum, and 9. 6 % (5 / 52) by A. tubaeforme. Forty-two canine fecal samples were collected from public environments, including 23 squares/gardens and 19 streets/sidewalks. Positive samples for Ancylostoma spp. accounted for 64. 3 % (27 / 42); squares/gardens had 60. 9 % (14 / 23) positive samples, and streets and sidewalks, 68. 4 % (13 / 19). No association was observed between the number of Ancylostoma spp parasites and age, sex and breed of the animals and also the ratio of EPG counts and the parasitic intensity observed at <b>necropsy</b> (<b>p</b> > 0. 05). Based on the high occurrence of hookworm in dogs and cats in this study, the treatment with anti helminthics are needed even in those animals with negative stool tests, besides adopting control of the number of animals in public places, in order to decrease the likelihood of environmental contamination, since this parasite represents a potential hazard to human and animal health...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Prematurely born {{children}} with {{patent ductus arteriosus}} are treated with ibuprofen or indomethacin, which may inhibit kidney development. We determined whether clinical doses affected kidney development and function, with or without extrauterine growth retardation. METHODS: Wistar rats were cross-fostered in normal food (NF) or food restricted (FR) litters at postnatal day (PND) 2. On PND 3 to 4, three doses of 0. 9 % NaCl, 0. 1 mg/kg indomethacin, or 10 mg/kg ibuprofen were administered via intraperitoneal injection with 12 -hr intervals. Kidneys were evaluated for apoptosis, proliferation, and gene expression at PND 8; stereological assessment of nephron number at PND 35; and clinical pathology and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin at 4 and 9 months. Blood pressure was measured at the ages of 4, 6, and 9 months. RESULTS: NF and FR bodyweight differed from PND 3 onwards, ranging from 16. 5 g at weaning (p < 0. 001) to 39 g at <b>necropsy</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 019). Kidney proliferation/apoptosis ratios were 7 : 1 and 3 : 1 (p = 0. 001), respectively and different expression of Wnt 4 (0. 7 x), Oat 1 (1. 3 x), Nphs 1 (1. 7 x), and Aqp 4 (1. 3 x) was noted (but its biological relevance doubted). Nephron numbers were decreased by 12 % (p = 0. 109) in the ibuprofen-NF group and 7. 5 % (p = 0. 237) in FR groups. This coincided with a tendency to increased neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin at 9 months. No differences were noted in electrolytes, creatinine, or urea clearance. No valid blood pressure results could be obtained. CONCLUSION: A clinical Ibuprofen dose showed potential to inhibit kidney development in neonatal rats. FR did not modulate these effect...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) subtype C infection worldwide calls for efforts to develop a relevant animal model for evaluating strategies against the transmission of the virus. A chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), SHIV(CHN) 19, was generated with a primary, non-syncytium-inducing HIV- 1 subtype C envelope from a Chinese strain {{in the background of}} SHIV 33. Unlike R 5 -tropic SHIV 162, SHIV(CHN) 19 was not found to replicate in rhesus CD 4 + T lymphocytes. SHIV(CHN) 19 does, however, replicate in CD 4 + T lymphocytes of pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina). The observed replication competence of SHIV(CHN) 19 requires the full tat/rev genes and partial gp 41 region derived from SHIV 33. To evaluate in vivo infectivity, SHIV(CHN) 19 was intravenously inoculated, at first, into two pig-tailed and two rhesus macaques. Although all four animals became infected, the virus replicated preferentially in pig-tailed macaques with an earlier plasma viral peak and a faster seroconversion. To determine whether in vivo adaptation would enhance the infectivity of SHIV(CHN) 19, passages were carried out serially in three groups of two pig-tailed macaques each, via intravenous blood-bone marrow transfusion. The passages greatly enhanced the infectivity of the virus as shown by the increasingly elevated viral loads during acute infection in animals with each passage. Moreover, the doubling time of plasma virus during acute infection became much shorter in passage 4 (<b>P</b> 4) <b>animals</b> (0. 2 day) in comparison to <b>P</b> 1 <b>animals</b> (1 to 2 days). P 2 to <b>P</b> 4 <b>animals</b> all became seropositive around 2 to 3 weeks postinoculation and had a decline in CD 4 /CD 8 T-cell ratio during the early phase of infection. In <b>P</b> 4 <b>animals,</b> a profound depletion of CD 4 T cells in the lamina propria of the jejunum was observed. Persistent plasma viremia has been found in most of the infected animals with sustained viral loads ranging from 103 to 105 per ml up to 6 months postinfection. Serial passages did not change the viral phenotype as confirmed by the persistence of the R 5 tropism of SHIV(CHN) 19 isolated from <b>P</b> 4 <b>animals.</b> In addition, the infectivity of SHIV(CHN) 19 in rhesus peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also increased after in vivo passages. Our data indicate that SHIV(CHN) 19 has adapted well to grow in macaque cells.

40|$|Many preterm infants require hyperoxic gas for survival, {{although}} it can contribute to lung injury.

We quantified macrophages in lung tissue (at P 7 d) and leukocytes in BALF (at P 56 d). At P 7 d, TJ increased pulmonary TAC and COL 1 α 1 expression and attenuated the hyperoxia-induced increase in nitrotyrosine and macrophage influx; however, changes in lung structure were not affected. At P 56 d, TJ increased TAC, decreased oxidative stress and reversed the hyperoxia-induced increase in bronchiolar smooth muscle. Additionally, TJ alone decreased IL- 1 β expression, but following hyperoxia TJ increased TNF-α expression and did not alter the hyperoxia-induced increase in leukocyte number. We conclude that TJ supplementation during and after neonatal exposure to hyperoxia protects the lung from some but not all aspects of hyperoxia-induced injury, but may also have adverse side-effects. The effects of TJ are likely due to elevation of circulating antioxidant concentrations...|$|R
50|$|Animal worship (or zoolatry) {{refers to}} rituals {{involving}} animals, {{such as the}} glorification of animal deities or animal sacrifice. When a god is respected or worshipped {{by means of a}} representative animal, an animal cult is formed (Teeter et al., 2002, <b>p.</b> 355). <b>Animal</b> cults may be classified according to their outward form or according to their inward meaning, which may of course undergo transformations.|$|R
40|$|Lack of an {{adequate}} animal model of Plasmodium falciparum severe malarial anemia (SMA) has hampered {{the understanding of}} this highly lethal condition. We developed a model of SMA by infecting C 57 BL/ 6 mice with P. chabaudi followed after recovery by P. berghei infection. P. chabaudi/P. berghei-infected mice had an initial 9 - to 10 -day phase of relatively low parasitemia and severe anemia, followed by a second phase of hyperparasitemia, more profound anemia, reticulocytosis, and death 14 to 21 days after infection. <b>P.</b> chabaudi/P. berghei-infected <b>animals</b> had more intense splenic hematopoiesis, higher interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) / tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL- 12 /gamma interferon (IFN-) ratios, and higher antibody levels against P. berghei and P. chabaudi antigens than P. berghei-infected or <b>P.</b> chabaudi-recovered <b>animals.</b> Early treatment with chloroquine or artesunate did not prevent the anemia, suggesting {{that the bulk of}} red cell destruction was not due to the parasite. Red cells from <b>P.</b> cha-baudi/P. berghei-infected <b>animals</b> had increased surface IgG and C 3 by flow cytometry. However, C 3 /mice still developed anemia. Tracking of red cells labeled ex vivo and in vivo and analysis of frozen tissue sections by immunofluorescence micros-copy showed that red cells from <b>P.</b> chabaudi/P. berghei-infected <b>animals</b> were removed at an accelerated rate in the liver by erythrophagocytosis. This model is practical and reproducible, and its similarities with P. falciparum SMA in humans makes it an appealing system with which to study the pathogenesis of this condition and explore potential immunomodulatory interventions. Plasmodium falciparum is an intracellular parasite of humansresponsible for 1 million to 2 million deaths per year. Sever...|$|R
40|$|Complete spinal transection in {{the mature}} nervous system is {{typically}} followed by minimal axonal repair, extensive motor paralysis {{and loss of}} sensory functions caudal to the injury. In contrast, the immature nervous system has greater capacity for repair, a phenomenon sometimes called the infant lesion effect. This study investigates spinal injuries early in development using the marsupial opossum Monodelphis domestica whose young are born very immature, allowing access to developmental stages only accessible in utero in eutherian mammals. Spinal cords of Monodelphis pups were completely transected in the lower thoracic region, T 10, on postnatal-day (P) 7 or P 28 and the animals grew to adulthood. In <b>P</b> 7 -injured <b>animals</b> regrown supraspinal and propriospinal axons through the injury site were demonstrated using retrograde axonal labelling. These animals recovered near-normal coordinated overground locomotion, but with altered gait characteristics including foot placement phase lags. In <b>P</b> 28 -injured <b>animals</b> no axonal regrowth through the injury site could be demonstrated yet {{they were able to}} perform weight-supporting hindlimb stepping overground and on the treadmill. When placed in an environment of reduced sensory feedback (swimming) <b>P</b> 7 -injured <b>animals</b> swam using their hindlimbs, suggesting that the axons that grew across the lesion made functional connections; <b>P</b> 28 -injured <b>animals</b> swam using their forelimbs only, suggesting that their overground hindlimb movements were reflex-dependent and thus likely to be generated locally in the lumbar spinal cord. Modifications to propriospinal circuitry in P 7 - and P 28 -injured opossums wer...|$|R

40|$|Animals were {{assigned}} to three experimental groups, conditioned (cyclophosphamide-glucose treatment; C group), non-conditioned (cyclophosphamide-commercial pellet treatment; NC group) and placebo (saline solution-glucose treatment; P group). The three groups were injected intraperitoneally (i. p.) with sheep red blood cells. An hemagglutination assay according to standard procedures was performed along with the flow cytofluorometric analysis of leukocyte surface antigens CD 4, CD 8 and CD 45. C group consumed less food on Days 3 and 6 than on Day 0, NC animals showed no changes in food consumption throughout the experimental period, whereas an increasing trend was observed for <b>P</b> <b>animals.</b> The proportion of T lymphocytes expressing CD 8 and CD 45 {{did not differ significantly}} among C, NC and P groups. Group C showed the lowest proportion of T lymphocytes bearing CD 4, whereas Group P displayed the highest. The antibody response was lower in the Group C than in the groups NC and P. We conclude that, although the mechanisms by which humoral conditioned immunosuppression occurs in mice is still unknown, a reduced T helper-mediated activation of B-cells may {{play an important role in}} producing conditioned humoral response...|$|R
