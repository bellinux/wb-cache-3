5|$|<b>NATO</b> <b>is</b> an {{alliance}} {{that consists of}} 29 independent member countries across North America and Europe. An additional 21countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programs. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total. Members' defense spending is supposed to amount to at least 2% of GDP by 2024.|$|E
5|$|Since its founding, the {{admission}} of new member states has increased the alliance from the original 12 countries to 29. The most recent member state {{to be added to}} <b>NATO</b> <b>is</b> Montenegro on 5 June 2017. NATO currently recognizes Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, and Macedonia as aspiring members.|$|E
5|$|Like any alliance, <b>NATO</b> <b>is</b> {{ultimately}} {{governed by}} its 29 member states. However, the North Atlantic Treaty and other agreements outline how decisions {{are to be}} made within NATO. Each of the 29 members sends a delegation or mission to NATO's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. The senior permanent member of each delegation {{is known as the}} Permanent Representative and is generally a senior civil servant or an experienced ambassador (and holding that diplomatic rank). Several countries have diplomatic missions to NATO through embassies in Belgium.|$|E

5000|$|The first question, on joining <b>NATO,</b> <b>was</b> government-sponsored. It was {{hypothetical}} as, under Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar, Slovakia had progressively {{become a}} pariah state, and <b>NATO</b> <b>were</b> unlikely {{to issue an}} invitation. [...] The second and third questions {{were related to the}} first, with the questions deliberately expressed in a manner that deterred 'yes' voters.|$|R

5|$|After its {{formation}} in 1949 with twelve founding members, NATO grew by including Greece and Turkey in 1952 and West Germany in 1955, {{and then later}} Spain in 1982. After the Cold War ended, and Germany reunited in 1990, there was a debate in NATO about continued expansion eastward. In 1999, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic joined the organization, amid much debate within the organization and Russian opposition. Another expansion came with the accession of seven Central and Eastern European countries: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. These nations were first invited to start talks of membership during the 2002 Prague summit, and joined NATO shortly before the 2004 Istanbul summit. Albania and Croatia joined on 1 April 2009, prior to the 2009 Strasbourg–Kehl summit. The most recent member state {{to be added to}} <b>NATO</b> <b>is</b> Montenegro on 5 June 2017.|$|E
5|$|Austria and Switzerland {{are both}} {{members of the}} Partnership for Peace, and border NATO member states. Malta {{is also a member}} of the Partnership for Peace and the European Union. However, each country has a long-standing policy of neutrality. Cyprus is the only Member state of the European Union that is not a member of the Partnership for Peace, with any treaty blocked by Turkey's {{concerns}} regarding the Cyprus dispute. According to Minister of Foreign Affairs Enver Hoxhaj, integration with <b>NATO</b> <b>is</b> a priority for Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008. Hoxhaj stated in 2014 that the country's goal is to be a NATO member by 2022. However, four NATO member states, Greece, Romania, Spain, and Slovakia, do not recognize Kosovo's independence. United Nations membership, which Kosovo does not have, is considered to be necessary for NATO membership.|$|E
5|$|The {{body that}} sets broad {{strategic}} goals for <b>NATO</b> <b>is</b> the NATO Parliamentary Assembly (NATO-PA) which meets at the Annual Session, {{and one other}} time during the year, and is the organ that directly interacts with the parliamentary structures of the national governments of the member states which appoint Permanent Members, or ambassadors to NATO. The NATO Parliamentary Assembly {{is made up of}} legislators from the member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance as well as thirteen associate members. Karl A. Lamers, German Deputy Chairman of the Defence Committee of the Bundestag {{and a member of the}} Christian Democratic Union, became president of the assembly in 2010. It is however officially a different structure from NATO, and has as aim to join together deputies of NATO countries in order to discuss security policies on the NATO Council.|$|E

5|$|This {{programme}} is one {{of three}} programmes that <b>NATO</b> <b>is</b> pursuing in the area of missile defence. The contract puts the Alliance on track for having, by 2010, a system to protect troops on missions against ballistic missiles. The contract is worth approximately 75 million EUR for work that would be conducted over a period of six years. The theatre missile defence would be a multi-layered system of systems, comprising early warning system sensors, radar and various interceptors. While NATO member countries would provide the sensors and weapon systems, NATO itself would develop a commonly funded NATO architecture to integrate all of these elements. The development of the ALTBMD system was agreed by NATO members in large part because it is limited. NATO members are deeply divided about the multi-tiered BMD architecture promoted by the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA).|$|E

It requires Bosnia and Herzegovina to define the issue of property over defence assets before NATO may consider the next steps. Bosnian political parties have different attitudes towards NATO: while Bosniak and Bosnian Croat parties support it, Bosnian Serb parties are more cautious and, while not opposing it in principle, require it {{to be put to}} a referendum first.|$|E

This demonstration {{shows that it}} is possible to give pilots the ability to distinguish between friendly and enemy platforms in a simple, low-impact fashion using the aircraft’s existing transponder. Finmeccanica says <b>NATO</b> <b>is</b> considering the system as a short- to mid-term solution for air-to-surface identification of friendly forces and thus avoid collateral damages due to friendly fire during close air support operations.|$|E

The [...] complex was designed by Jo Palma and home to a staff of 3800.

500|$|The European Union (EU) {{signed a}} {{comprehensive}} package of arrangements with NATO under the Berlin Plus agreement on 16December 2002. With this agreement, the EU {{was given the}} possibility to use NATO assets in case it wanted to act independently in an international crisis, {{on the condition that}} NATO itself did not want to act—the so-called [...] "right of first refusal". For example, Article 42(7) of the 1982 Treaty of Lisbon specifies that [...] "If a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power". The treaty applies globally to specified territories whereas <b>NATO</b> <b>is</b> restricted under its Article 6 to operations north of the Tropic of Cancer.

500|$|The summit was {{dominated}} by divisions over the Iraq war as NATO members were only able to agree to limited assistance {{in the form of}} training for Iraqi security forces. The NATO support given to Iraq troop training was in response to a request by the Iraqi Interim Government, and in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546, which requests international and regional organisations to contribute assistance to the multinational force. Even this limited agreement contained areas of contention, with France insisting that it would only help with training outside Iraq, while the United States favored that the training would take place inside Iraq. As a consequence, the deal was left deliberately vague and differences remained on whether NATO should train Iraqi officers inside Iraq, or limit itself to training outside the country and acting as a clearing house for national efforts. The commitment was also vague as it was not made clear what the size of the training mission would be or exactly when and where it would take place. German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, known for his earlier opposition to the Iraq War, commented: [...] "The engagement of <b>NATO</b> <b>is</b> reduced to training and only training. We have made clear that we don't want to see German soldiers in Iraq." [...] Despite outwardly optimistic statements by the US concerning NATO's commitment towards Iraqi troop training after the summit, France and Germany had refused to share the burden of responsibility for the situation in Iraq and did not support the US and British demand for sending NATO troops. Put differently, participation in the multinational forces in Iraq was left to the discretion of the particular alliance members and the USA relunctantly consented to troop training outside Iraq. Consequently, despite an outward show of NATO unity, the split over Iraq still persisted and tensions in interstate relations within the alliance were not resolved.|$|E
