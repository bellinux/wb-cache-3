50|$|Cremer was {{involved}} {{early in the}} further development of laser based light microscopy approaches. First ideas had their origin in his graduate student years in the 1970s. Jointly with his brother Thomas Cremer, now professor (chair) of Anthropology and Human Genetics at the Ludwigs-Maximilian University in Munich, Christoph Cremer proposed {{the development of a}} hologram-based laser scanning 4Pi microscope. The basic idea was to focus laser light from all sides (space angle 4Pi) in a spot with a diameter smaller than the conventional laser focus and to scan the object by means of this spot. In this manner, {{it should be possible to}} achieve an improved optical resolution beyond the conventional limit of approx. 200 nm lateral, 600 nm axial. Since 1992, 4Pi microscopy has been developed by Stefan Hell (Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen) into a highly efficient, high-resolution imaging process, using two microscope objective lenses of high <b>numeric</b> <b>aperture</b> opposing each other.|$|E
40|$|We report {{investigation}} of light-induced damage threshold (LIDT) in purified silica (transmission band down to 160 nm) by 350 fs laser pulses at the wavelength of 795 nm and 498 nm. Focusing a single pulse {{by a high}} <b>numeric</b> <b>aperture</b> NA = 1. 35 microscope objective lens results {{in one of the}} lowest single-shot bulk LIDT values reported so far, 5 J/cm(2), while the surface ablation threshold is 2. 5 J/cm(2) with both values being well below the critical self-focusing power in silica. Furthermore, we report the peculiarities of damage by two-pulse irradiation (duration of each pulse is 440 fs), where both pulses have energies at the level of 0. 5 x LIDT. Comparison between the experimental data and numeric simulation, which takes into account optical free-carrier generation and relaxation, demonstrates that these processes can explain the measured self-focusing, super-continuum generation, and light-induced damage threshold values. We argue that use of high <b>numeric</b> <b>aperture</b> objective, despite substantial temporal pulse stretching, results in tight focusing which is capable of overcoming the beam self-focusing, and the resulting fabrication quality is comparable to that obtained using shorter pulses...|$|E
30|$|Besides, {{to avoid}} {{specimen}} transfer {{that would cause}} severe ice contamination and specimen devitrification, an integrated cryo-CLEM workflow was developed, the so-called “iCorr” by the FEI Company, which integrates a fluorescence light microscope into the column of a transmission electron microscope (TEM). To use the iCorr system, the specimen loaded with a cryo-holder is rotated 90 ° to be imaged by fluorescence microscope (FM mode) and then rotated back to 0 ° for cryo-EM imaging (TEM mode). The iCorr system uses a LED illumination with the excitation wavelength ranging from 460 to 500  nm and with the peak at 470  nm. An optical filter in the iCorr system is used {{to pass through the}} emission light with the wavelength ranging from 510 to 560  nm. With a fixed objective lens having a <b>numeric</b> <b>aperture</b> (NA) of 0.5, the iCorr system can capture the fluorescence images at the green channel with the magnification of × 15 and the resolution of ~ 460  nm. Considering the early development stage of the iCorr system, there are a few cryo-CLEM applications of iCorr system in the literature. In the present work, we intend to test our prototype iCorr system integrated onto our Tecnai Spirit electron microscope by imaging cryo-vitrified rat hippocampal neuron cells.|$|E
40|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the high selectivity and reduced path-length dependence of two-photon excited fluorescence, a capillary electrophoresis system employing TPE fluorescence detection has been constructed. Characterization of the instrument, including the effects of beam astigmatism, is performed. Additionally, a comparison between 90 ° and epi-excitation geometries is conducted in order to optimize the instrument 2 ̆ 7 s performance. Major findings include {{the presence of a}} two-photon fluorescent impurity in the capillary walls, the nonideal behavior of the two-photon excitation volume in cylindrical capillaries, and application of the detection system to capillary microchip devices. ^ The fluorescent impurity originating from the capillary walls is reduced by spatial filtering and time-filtered detection. The loss in sensitivity of TPE fluorescence, when switching from a 1 -cm cell format to capillaries, is determined to result from a shortened path length and astigmatism. Despite the ability to use higher <b>numeric</b> <b>aperture</b> objectives, a comparison between 90 ° and epi-excitation geometries reveals that due to the increased background, both orientations offer similar performance. Application of TPE to microchips is shown to offer detection limits in the submicromolar domain. ^ Additionally, electrophoretically mediated microanalysis is performed {{for the first time on}} a capillary microchip device. The enzyme, leucine aminopeptidase, is assayed on a microchip using TPE fluorescence detection. ...|$|E
