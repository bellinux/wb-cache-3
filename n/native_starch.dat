40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of potassium and magnesium treatment on physicochemical and rheological properties of native potato, corn, and spelt starches. Treatment of starch {{by one of the}} metals resulted in an increase in the amount of the used element, with the increase accompanied by decrease in the amount of the other metal. Starches fortified with metal ions did not differ significantly from the <b>native</b> <b>starches</b> in gelatinization characteristics. Effect of metal ions on rheological behavior of starch pastes was the greatest in corn starch with potassium. In the case of the other pastes the effect depended both on type of starch and kind of metal ions. The modified starches formed harder gels than the <b>native</b> <b>starches.</b> Starches treated with potassium ions showed lower rate of retrogradation than the respective <b>native</b> <b>starches.</b> The modified starches were also more susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis than their native counter- parts. Thermal treatment of native and modified with potassium and magnesium starches led to formation of carbohydrate radicals, which character and amounts depended on the starch origin as well as the kind of metal ions. Spelt starch was the most susceptible to the formation of radicals, whereas the structure of corn starch was the most stable.

The acidity and heat treatment increased the starch gels structure that resisted to the processing stress conditions. The starch gels exhibited non-newtonian (pseudoplastic) and thixotropic behavior.

Chemical modification by esterification with acetic anhydride was performed at different reaction times, and morphological and structural changes were assessed using the following techniques: infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Acetylation produced slight changes in the granule morphology, and a decreased degree of crystallinity (DC) associated with a slight increase in the amylose content was observed. The introduction of acetyl groups into the starch structure caused a decrease in the gelatinization temperature and an increased retro gradation tendency. The acetylated starches had low degrees of substitution (DS< 0. 2), meaning they can be used in the food industry, considering that they showed greater stability, greater water absorption capacity and better solubility than <b>native</b> <b>starches...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{rheological}} properties of gels of hydrophobically modified potato starch (HMPot) and high amylopectin potato starch (HAPP) were studied by small deformation oscillatory rheometry. The hydrophobic modification consisted of octenyl succinate anhydride (OSA) chains grafted {{mainly on the}} amylopectin molecules. The theological behaviour of HMPot {{was different from the}} behaviour of <b>native</b> potato <b>starch</b> and HAPP. At concentrations higher than similar to 15 %, the moduli for HMPot starch were higher than for <b>native</b> potato <b>starch</b> and HAPP. A higher level of OSA Substitution led to lower moduli values. The gel formation of HMPot was slower than the gel formation of <b>native</b> potato <b>starch</b> and HAPP. This was explained by the formation of amylose-OSA inclusion complexes and OSA-OSA hydrophobic interactions. Decreasing concentrations of HMPot in HMPot-HAPP mixtures led to reduced moduli values, and a theological behaviour resembling that of HAPP. At HMPot concentrations lower than 50 % in the HMpot-HAPP mixture, amylose or OSA seemed not to contribute to the network formation. Addition of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) to HMPot reduced the moduli at lower concentrations (1 %). Further increase in SDS concentration (2 %) increased the moduli values. However, the moduli values were still lower than for pure HMPot. The decrease in the moduli when SDS was added is Suggested to be due to a replacement of OSA by SDS in the amylose-inclusion complex. The strengthening of the existing OSA-OSA hydrophobic interaction when further SDS was added, is explained by the formation of polymer-micelles. When SDS was added to <b>native</b> potato <b>starch</b> and HAPP the theological behaviour was different from that observed for HMPot starch. The moduli increased when SDS was added to <b>native</b> potato <b>starch</b> and HAPP. With increasing SDS concentration, the storage modulus (G') of <b>native</b> potato <b>starch</b> and HAPP increased to the same value. Consequently, the {{rheological properties}} of <b>native</b> potato <b>starch</b> and HAPP were suggested to be dominated by amylopectin and not by amylose. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

There was {{a significant increase in}} cold water soluble and damaged starch in cryo-milled samples in the order PS > MS > HAMS. Viscosity parameters of milled starches were significantly lower than for <b>native</b> <b>starches,</b> although changes in pasting temperature were not significant. In vitro digestion of <b>native</b> <b>starches</b> showed that enzyme resistance followed the order PS > HAMS > MS. A significant increase in enzyme digestion rate was observed after cryo-milling PS and HAMS but not MS. However, cryo-milled PS and HAMS were still less rapidly-digested than native MS. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of native, milled and digested starches showed a uniform ‘inside-out’ digestion pattern for MS, whereas a heterogeneous and nonspecific pattern was observed for PS and HAMS. This study suggests that milling has predominantly mechanical rather than thermal effects on starches and that the relative enzyme resistance of PS and HAMS granules compared with MS is due to the absence of the structural features of MS granules that allow internal access of enzymes.
