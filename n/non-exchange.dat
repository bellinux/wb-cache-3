40|$|The aim was {{to measure}} the {{respective}} contributions of apoplast and symplast to the Cd root uptake and to explain the linear component of the symplastic absorption. Two plants were used, maize (Zea mays L.) and two ecotypes of alpine pennycress (Noccaea caerulescens (J. Presl & C. Presl) F. K. Mey.), with contrasted abilities to accumulate Cd. Their roots were exposed to labelled Cd solutions of increasing concentrations. Root Cd was physico-chemically fractioned to obtain the exchanged apoplastic, <b>non-exchanged</b> apoplastic and symplastic pools. For both species, the proportion of Cd retained by the cell walls increased with Cd concentration in the exposure solution (ranging from 0. 05 to 50 μmol L− 1), from approximately 30 % to 90 % of the total root Cd. This was modeled using Freundlich isotherms. The <b>non-exchanged</b> apoplastic Cd was negligible at the highest exposure concentrations, but reached almost 30 % of the total root uptake at the lowest ones. The symplastic influx in roots of both species fitted a Michaelis-Menten function associated with a linear one. The linear component of the symplastic influx could reflect absorption through a low-affinity transport system (LATS). The strong adsorption of Cd on root apoplast might act as a driving force to extract the metal from the soil, compete with the symplastic absorption {{and contribute to the}} amount of element taken up by the plant, at least in its roots...|$|R

The DOSY spectrum will be much harder to interpret and can often give the appearance of extra (spurious) components in the mixture. Here a new and surprisingly simple experiment is described that suppresses the effects of exchange on apparent diffusion coefficients, restoring the simplicity of interpretation enjoyed by <b>non-exchanging</b> systems...|$|R

The model parameters are determined so as to minimize the Frobenius norm of the difference between the measured kurtosis tensor and the model kurtosis tensor. This framework, referred to as kurtosis analysis of neural diffusion organization (KANDO), may be used to help provide a biophysical interpretation to the information provided by the kurtosis tensor.

40|$|Membrane vesicles {{composed}} of fatty acids {{can be made}} to grow and divide under laboratory conditions, and thus provide a model system relevant to the emergence of cellular life. Fatty acid vesicles grow spontaneously when alkaline micelles are added to buffered vesicles. To investigate the mechanism of this process, we used stopped-flow kinetics to analyze the dilution of <b>non-exchanging</b> FRET probes incorporated into preformed vesicles during growth. Oleate vesicle growth occurs in two phases (fast and slow), indicating two pathways for the incorporation of fatty acid into preformed vesicles. We propose that the fast phase, which is stoichiometrically limited by the preformed vesicles, results from the formation of a “shell” of fatty acid around a vesicle, followed by rapid transfer of this fatty acid into the preformed vesicle. The slower phase may result from incorporation of fatty acid which had been trapped in an intermediate state. We provide independent evidence for the rapid transformation of micelles into an aggregated intermediate form after transfer from high to low pH. Our results show that the most efficient incorporation of added oleate into oleic acid/oleate vesicles occurs under conditions that avoid a large transient increase in the micelle/vesicle ratio...|$|R
40|$|We review, systematize {{and discuss}} models of {{diffusion}} in neuronal tissue, by putting {{them into an}} overarching physical context of coarse-graining over an increasing diffusion length scale. From this perspective, we view research on quantifying brain microstructure as occurring along the three major avenues. The first avenue focusses on the transient, or time-dependent, effects in diffusion. These effects signify the gradual coarse-graining of tissue structure, which occurs qualitatively differently in different brain tissue compartments. We show that studying the transient effects {{has the potential to}} quantify the relevant length scales for neuronal tissue, such as the packing correlation length for neuronal fibers, the degree of neuronal beading, and compartment sizes. The second avenue corresponds to the long-time limit, when the observed signal can be approximated as a sum of multiple <b>non-exchanging</b> anisotropic Gaussian components. Here the challenge lies in parameter estimation and in resolving its hidden degeneracies. The third avenue employs multiple diffusion encoding techniques, able to access information not contained in the conventional diffusion propagator. We conclude with our outlook on the future research directions which can open exciting possibilities for developing markers of pathology and development based on methods of studying mesoscopic transport in disordered systems.

40|$|Gas {{separation}} membranes {{are one of}} {{the lowest}} energy technologies available for the separation of carbon dioxide from flue gas. Key to handling the immense scale of this separation is maximised membrane permeability at sufficient selectivity for CO 2 over N 2. For the first time it is revealed that metals can be post-synthetically exchanged in MOFs to drastically enhance gas transport performance in membranes. Ti-exchanged UiO- 66 MOFs have been found to triple the gas permeability without a loss in selectivity due to several effects that include increased affinity for CO 2 and stronger interactions between the polymer matrix and the Ti-MOFs. As a result, it is also shown that MOFs optimized in previous works for batch-wise adsorption applications can be applied to membranes, which have lower demands on material quantities. These membranes exhibit exceptional CO 2 permeability enhancement of as much as 153 % when compared to the <b>non-exchanged</b> UiO- 66 mixed-matrix controls, which places them well above the Robeson upper bound at just a 5 wt. % loading.

40|$|A common {{assumption}} is that commodification - {{the process by which}} goods and services are increasingly produced by capitalist firms for a profit under conditions of market exchange - is colonizing, albeit slowly and unevenly, ever more areas of daily life. Yet little evidence has been supplied to show either the extent or unevenness of this penetration. Here, therefore, we first draw upon secondary data to evaluate {{the degree to which the}} advanced economies have been permeated by commodification. This identifies large spaces of <b>non-exchanged</b> work, non-monetized exchange and non-profit-motivated monetary exchange. To both explain the existence of these spaces as well as the uneven penetration of commodification, we then report case study evidence from the sphere of domestic services in UK urban areas. This displays that although domestic services are slightly more commodified amongst higher-income populations, the uneven contours of commodification cannot be explained simply in terms of whether populations can afford to use formal service provision. While economic constraints do prevent the advance of commodification, especially in lower-income populations, strong 'cultures of resistance' are also uncovered that impede its deeper penetration. To conclude, therefore, the contrasting roles played by economic and cultural constraints in slowing the advance of commodification and creating its uneven contours are explored.

40|$|The {{nuclear matrix}} bound {{transcription}} factor RUNX 2 is a lineage-specific developmental regulator that {{is linked to}} cancer. We have previously shown that RUNX 2 controls transcription of both RNA polymerase II genes and RNA polymerase I dependent ribosomal RNA genes. RUNX 2 is epigenetically retained through mitosis on both classes of target genes in condensed chromosomes. We have used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to measure the relative binding kinetics of EGFP-RUNX 2 at transcription sites in the nucleus and nucleoli during interphase, {{as well as on}} mitotic chromosomes. RUNX 2 becomes more strongly bound as cells go from interphase through prophase, with a doubling of the most tightly bound 2 ̆ 2 immobile fraction 2 ̆ 2. RUNX 2 exchange then becomes much more facile during metaphase to telophase. During interphase the less tightly bound pool of RUNX 2 exchanges more slowly at nucleoli than at subnuclear foci, and the <b>non-exchanging</b> immobile fraction is greater in nucleoli. These results are consistent with a model in which the molecular mechanism of RUNX 2 binding is different at protein-coding and ribosomal RNA genes. The binding interactions of RUNX 2 change as cells go through mitosis, with binding affinity increasing as chromosomes condense and then decreasing through subsequent mitotic phases. The increased residence of RUNX 2 at mitotic chromosomes may reflect its epigenetic function in 2 ̆ 2 bookmarking 2 ̆ 2 of target genes in cancer cells. (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Measurement of {{exchange}} of substances between blood and tissue {{has been a}} long-lasting challenge to physiologists, and considerable theoretical and experimental accomplishments were achieved before {{the development of the}} positron emission tomography (PET). Today, when modeling data from modern PET scanners, little use is made of earlier microvascular research in the compartmental models, which have become the standard model by which the vast majority of dynamic PET data are analysed. However, modern PET scanners provide data with a sufficient temporal resolution and good counting statistics to allow estimation of parameters in models with more physiological realism. We explore the standard compartmental model and find that incorporation of blood flow leads to paradoxes, such as kinetic rate constants being time-dependent, and tracers being cleared from a capillary faster than they can be supplied by blood flow. The inability of the standard model to incorporate blood flow consequently raises a need for models that include more physiology, and we develop microvascular models which remove the inconsistencies. The microvascular models can be regarded as a revision of the input function. Whereas the standard model uses the organ inlet concentration as the concentration throughout the vascular compartment, we consider models that make use of spatial averaging of the concentrations in the capillary volume, which is what the PET scanner actually registers. The microvascular models are developed for both single- and multi-capillary systems and include effects of <b>non-exchanging</b> vessels. They are suitable for analysing dynamic PET data from any capillary bed using either intravascular or diffusible tracers, in terms of physiological parameters which include regional blood flow.

40|$|In aqueous {{systems with}} immobilized macromolecules, {{including}} biological tissue, the longitudinal spin relaxation of water protons is primarily induced by exchange-mediated orientational randomization (EMOR) of intra- and intermolecular magnetic dipole-dipole couplings. We have {{embarked on a}} systematic program to develop, from the stochastic Liouville equation, a general and rigorous theory that can describe relaxation by the dipolar EMOR mechanism over {{the full range of}} exchange rates, dipole coupling strengths, and Larmor frequencies. Here, we present a general theoretical framework applicable to spin systems of arbitrary size with symmetric or asymmetric exchange. So far, the dipolar EMOR theory is only available for a two-spin system with symmetric exchange. Asymmetric exchange, when the spin system is fragmented by the exchange, introduces new and unexpected phenomena. Notably, the anisotropic dipole couplings of <b>non-exchanging</b> spins break the axial symmetry in spin Liouville space, thereby opening up new relaxation channels in the locally anisotropic sites, including longitudinal-transverse cross relaxation. Such cross-mode relaxation operates only at low fields; at higher fields it becomes nonsecular, leading to an unusual inverted relaxation dispersion that splits the extreme-narrowing regime into two sub-regimes. The general dipolar EMOR theory is illustrated here by a detailed analysis of the asymmetric two-spin case, for which we present relaxation dispersion profiles over a wide range of conditions as well as analytical results for integral relaxation rates and time-dependent spin modes in the zero-field and motional-narrowing regimes. The general theoretical framework presented here will enable a quantitative analysis of frequency-dependent water-proton longitudinal relaxation in model systems with immobilized macromolecules and, ultimately, will provide a rigorous link between relaxation-based magnetic resonance image contrast and molecular parameters...|$|R

Tumours were perfused in situ and blood flow was calculated from simultaneous measurement of (1) venous outflow from the tumour and (2) uptake into the tumour of radiolabelled iodo-antipyrine (IAP). Comparison of results from the two measurements enabled assessment {{of the amount of}} blood 'shunted' through the tumours with minimal exchange between blood and tissue. Kinetics of IAP uptake were also used to determine the apparent volume of distribution (VDapp) for the tracer and the equilibrium tissue-blood partition coefficient (lambda). lambda was also measured by in vitro techniques and checks were made for binding and metabolism of IAP using high-pressure liquid chromatography. VDapp and lambda were used to calculate the perfused fraction (alpha) of the tumours. Tumour blood flow, as measured by IAP (TBFIAP), was 94. 8 +/- 4. 4 % of the blood flow as measured by venous outflow, indicating only a small amount of <b>non-exchanging</b> flow. This level of shunting is lower than some previous estimates in which the percentage tumour entrapment of microspheres was used. The unperfused fraction ranged from 0 to 20 % of the tumour volume in the majority of tumours. This could be due to tumour necrosis and/or acutely ischaemic tumour regions. For practical purposes, measurement of the total venous outflow of tumours is a reasonable measure of exchangeable tumour blood flow in this system and allows for on-line measurements. Tracer methods can be used to obtain additional information on the distribution of blood flow within tumours...|$|R
