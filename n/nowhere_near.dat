5|$|By the 1570s, an {{underground}} church was growing {{fast as the}} Church of England became more Protestant and less bearable for Roman Catholics who were still a sizeable minority. Only one public attempt to restore the old religion occurred: the Rising of the Northern earls in 1569. It was a botched attempt; in spite of tumultuous crowds who greeted the rebels in Durham, the rebellion did not spread. The assistance they sought did not materialise, their communication with allies at Court was poor.

5000|$|From the 1890s, small river steamers {{operated}} between Chinde at {{the mouth}} of the Zambezi and Chiromo on the Lower Shire River, a distance of 180 miles. However, the main areas of economic activity in the BCA were around Blantyre in the Shire Highlands, over 50 miles from Chiromo, and transport to the river was costly and inefficient. Steamers also navigated the Upper Shire and Lake Nyasa (now Lake Malawi), but about 50 miles of the Middle Shire was impassable. Railways could supplement water transport and, as the BCA was <b>nowhere</b> <b>nearer</b> than 200 miles to a suitable Indian Ocean port, a short rail link to river ports was more practical than a line direct to the coast.|$|R

5|$|Glacier National Park is {{dominated}} by mountains which were carved into their present shapes by the huge glaciers of the last ice age. These glaciers have largely disappeared over the last 12,000 years. Evidence of widespread glacial action is found throughout the park {{in the form of}} U-shaped valleys, cirques, arêtes, and large outflow lakes radiating like fingers {{from the base of the}} highest peaks. Since the end of the ice ages, various warming and cooling trends have occurred. The last recent cooling trend was during the Little Ice Age, which took place approximately between 1550 and 1850. During the Little Ice Age, the glaciers in the park expanded and advanced, although to <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> as great an extent as they had during the Ice Age.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008, the Amami Rangers {{for nature}} {{conservation}} obtained {{a photograph of}} a feral cat carrying a rabbit corpse (rabbit bones and fur found in cat or dog droppings had already been found), prompting discussions on better ways to control pets. A small area of the Amami Island has the Amami Gunto Quasi-National Park that further protects the population. Some attempt at habitat restoration has been made, but the Amami rabbit needs a mosaic of mature and young forest in close proximity, and when a young forest is regrown <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> a mature forest, this rabbit is not likely to inhabit it. Research and population monitoring also is underway to try to keep the numbers from declining, even if they can not be increased.|$|E
5|$|Goalkeepers {{should be}} wary of dummying, lob shots and skip or bounce shots. Dummying is where players fake shots, leading keepers {{to come out of}} the water too early. This can cause the goalkeeper to come up too early and have to go back down for energy. The lob shot is where a field player {{attempts}} to put the ball over where the goalkeeper's hands can reach. This usually happens either if the goalkeeper is out of position from the dummies or if they are too far out from the goal. The goalkeeper should swim back to try to block it, as it is <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> as fast as the power shot. The bounce or skip shot is where a player propels the ball at the water with enough force to make it bounce or skim along the water. It can take the goalkeeper by surprise as they cannot predict the direction the ball will go.|$|E
50|$|Railways could {{supplement}} {{water transport}} and, as Nyasaland was <b>nowhere</b> <b>nearer</b> than 200 miles to a suitable Indian Ocean port, a short rail link to river ports that eliminated porterage was initially more practical than a line direct {{to the coast}} passing through areas of low population. The Shire Highlands Railway opened a line from Blantyre to Chiromo in 1907, and extended it to Port Herald, 113 miles from Blantyre in 1908. After Port Herald became unsatisfactory, the British South Africa Company built the Central African Railway, mainly in Mozambique, of 61 miles from Port Herald to Chindio on the north bank of the Zambezi in 1914. From here, goods went by river steamers to Chinde then by sea to Beira, involving three transhipments and delays. The Central African Railway was poorly built, and soon needed extensive repairs.|$|R

The Olympics closing ceremony the following night gave BBC One more than 20 times the audience share of ITV.

5|$|Spectral {{analysis}} of Makemake's surface revealed that methane must {{be present in}} the form of large grains at least one centimetre in size. In addition to methane, large amounts of ethane and tholins as well as smaller amounts of ethylene, acetylene and high-mass alkanes (like propane) may be present, most likely created by photolysis of methane by solar radiation. The tholins are probably responsible for the red color of the visible spectrum. Although evidence exists for the presence of nitrogen ice on its surface, at least mixed with other ices, there is <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> the same level of nitrogen as on Pluto and Triton, where it composes more than 98percent of the crust. The relative lack of nitrogen ice suggests that its supply of nitrogen has somehow been depleted over the age of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|UB-12s {{activities}} {{over the}} next year are not well documented, and no specific record of her can be found in English-language sources. However, it is known that during this period, she was helmed by four different commanders, with the final officer, Oblt. Ernst Schöller, assuming command in May 1918. Under Schöller's command, UB-12 departed Zeebrugge on 19 August to lay mines in the Downs off the Kentish coast, but never returned. According to one British source, UB-12 was herself mined off Helgoland sometime in August. Author Dwight Messimer considers this unlikely given that Helgoland is <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> the route that UB-12 could have taken to get to the Downs. A postwar German study concluded the two most likely fates for UB-12 were that she either struck a British mine or was destroyed by one of her own mines that malfunctioned during deployment. Messimer also considers it possible that UB-12 may have had a diving accident related to her conversion to a minelayer.|$|E

60|$|After {{surveying}} the basin, itself, with sufficient care, Bob pulled the dingui {{back towards the}} ship, Mark sounding as they proceeded. But two difficulties {{were found between the}} points that it was so desirable to bring in communication with each other. One of these difficulties consisted in a passage between two lines of reef, that ran nearly parallel for a quarter of a mile, and which were only half a cable's-length asunder. There was abundance of water between these reefs, but the difficulty was in the course, and in the narrowness of the passage. Mark passed through the latter four several times, sounding it, as it might be, foot by foot, and examining the bottom with the eye; for, in that pellucid water, with the sun near the zenith, it was possible to see two or three fathoms down, and nowhere did he find any other obstacle than this just mentioned. Nor was any buoy necessary, the water breaking over {{the southern end of the}} outer, and over the northern end of the inner ledge, and <b>nowhere</b> else <b>near</b> by, thus distinctly noting the very two points where it would be necessary to alter the course.|$|R
5|$|At Aliso Beach, {{the mouth}} of Aliso Creek, lies a {{freshwater}} pond that changes frequently in elevation and extent. Tidal activity at the creek's mouth results in sediment building gradually up into a sandbar, impounding it in a small lake about 0.2 miles (0.3km) long at its fullest extent. Afterwards, the water level rises upstream of the sandbar until one of two factors causes it to breach: either waves at high tide wash away {{the top of the}} sandbar, or the lagoon rises enough to overtop the sandbar by itself. Once the water level rises above the sandbar, rapid erosion quickly cuts through the sand and drains the approximately 3–5-foot (0.9–1.5 m)-deep lake in a matter of minutes. Peak flows through the sandbar can reach , even if the incoming flow of the creek is <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> that size. Because of the raised flow of the creek and the construction of a parking lot in the lagoon area since the 1960s, the lagoon has never been able to fill to its much larger, historic extent without breaching. Species such as the tidewater goby have suffered because of loss of their habitat this way.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the high}} regard held for {{dominion}} troops {{as a result of}} their exploits in France during the war they were specifically targeted for recruitment. Indeed, some 400 to 500 men of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF)—who were in England awaiting repatriation to Australia following the end of the war—initially indicated a willingness to join, but <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> as many actually enlisted. All Australians who volunteered were discharged from the AIF and re-enlisted in the British army as private soldiers for a period of one year. This was necessary because the dominions had already indicated that they were not interested in providing forces for the intervention. Ultimately about 150 Australians enlisted to serve in the NRRF, most of them recruited by Major Harry Harcourt. The Australians mainly served in the 45th Battalion and the 201st Machine Gun Battalion under Sadlier-Jackson, although some may also have served in the 46th Battalion. Despite being enlisted in the British Army the Australians wore uniforms of the AIF and were formed into two mainly Australian companies in the 45th Battalion.|$|E

Ewald Christian von Kleist, the famous poet of the Prussian army, was badly injured in the latter moments of {{the assault on the}} Walkeberge. By the time he was injured, Major Kleist was the highest-ranking officer in his regiment. Generalleutnant August Friedrich von Itzenplitz died of his wounds on 5 September, Prince Charles Anton August von Holstein-Beck on 12 September, and Finck's brigade commander, Generalmajor George Ernst von Klitzing, on 28 October in Stettin. Prussia was at its last gasp and Frederick despaired of preserving much of his remaining kingdom for his heir.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his later}} work, Versfeld expresses his {{critique}} of religious apologetics - against [...] "some superficial fools who write books on apologetics". At {{the end of his}} life, he reiterated this view: “there are works of Catholic apologetics of the very recent past which claim to provide all the answers, falling very far short of the wisdom of the sage in Chuang-zu (22.1) who said: ‘We come <b>nowhere</b> being <b>near</b> right, since we have the answers.” Furthermore, he acknowledged the ambiguity of his own faith: [...] "To be a Christian cannot possibly mean to conform to a type or to coincide with the paradigm case. And if you are asked by anybody with such an idea {{in the back of his}} mind, whether you are a Christian, it is intensely embarrassing. You may say no, not because you are Judas, but because you are trying not to be." [...] Still later, he would conclude: [...] "True religion finds itself comic.". This almost negative-theological trait of his later religious thought is accompanied by a secularising turn - his later philosophy is shot through with the conviction that [...] "The secular is the miraculous." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{margin of}} the island is formed by a rude circle of great, black, stratified, ramparts of basalt, dipping seaward, and worn into cliffs, which are often nearly perpendicular, and vary in height from {{a few hundred feet}} to two thousand. This circle, or rather horse-shoe shaped ring, is open to the south, and is {{breached}} by several other wide spaces. Its rim or summit generally projects little above the level of the adjoining inland country; and the more recent feldspathic lavas, sloping down from the central heights, generally abut against and overlap its inner margin; on the north-western side of the island, however, they appear (judging from a distance) to have flowed over and concealed portions of it. In some parts, where the basaltic ring has been breached, and the black ramparts stand detached, the feldspathic lavas have passed between them, and now overhang the sea-coast in lofty cliffs. The basaltic rocks are of a black colour and thinly stratified; they are generally highly vesicular, but occasionally compact; some of them contain numerous crystals of glassy feldspar and octahedrons of titaniferous iron; others abound with crystals of augite and grains of olivine. The vesicles are frequently lined with minute crystals (of chabasie?) and even become amygdaloidal with them. The streams are separated from each other by cindery matter, or by a bright red, friable, saliferous tuff, which is marked by successive lines like those of aqueous deposition; and sometimes it has an obscure, concretionary structure. The rocks of this basaltic series occur <b>nowhere</b> except <b>near</b> the coast. In most volcanic districts the trachytic lavas are of anterior origin to the basaltic; but here we see, that a great pile of rock, closely related in composition to the trachytic family, has been erupted subsequently to the basaltic strata: the number, however, of dikes, abounding with large crystals of augite, with which the feldspathic lavas have been injected, shows perhaps some tendency to a return to the more usual order of superposition.|$|R

5|$|On 24 April, {{the first}} {{prisoner}} {{escaped from the}} main camp; {{the same day that}} the injured second prisoner was taken in by Machuca and his men. Interrogation of the new prisoner, {{who turned out to be}} an Itza nobleman, revealed that the Itza kingdom was in a state of high alert to repel the Spanish. Friar Cano met with his fellow Dominicans to discuss what should be done, having had information from both Machuca and his prisoner that the Itza were ready for war. The Dominicans were highly critical of the Spanish soldiers' readiness to open fire on poorly armed natives who offered no real threat to them, and suspected that President Barrios was <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> the lake; furthermore the Spanish were beginning to succumb to sickness, and the Verapaz Indian recruits were deserting daily. Díaz agreed with the Dominicans; two muleteers had already died from sickness, and he recognised that the size of his expedition was not sufficient for a full confrontation with the Itza nation. The expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahabón. The new prisoner, AjK'ixaw was later taken back to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, where the Dominicans questioned him in detail. In Guatemala AjK'ixaw learnt Spanish and returned to Petén in 1696 as a guide and interpreter for another expedition, before turning on his captors. After the Spanish retreated to Guatemala, rumours ran rife among the Itza and Kowoj that they would return to engage in wholesale slaughter of the Maya population; large tracts of territory were abandoned in response, including many towns in an area stretching from Lake Petén Itzá eastwards to Tipuj and southwards to Mopán.|$|E

60|$|The inhabitants, {{from their}} {{complexion}} and low stature, {{appear to have}} three-fourths of Indian blood in their veins. They are an humble, quiet, industrious set of men. Although the fertile soil, resulting from the decomposition of the volcanic rocks, supports a rank vegetation, yet the climate is not favourable to any production which requires much sunshine to ripen it. There is very little pasture for the larger quadrupeds; and in consequence, the staple articles of food are pigs, potatoes, and fish. The people all dress in strong woollen garments, which each family makes for itself, and dyes with indigo of a dark blue colour. The arts, however, are in the rudest state;--as {{may be seen in}} their strange fashion of ploughing, their method of spinning, grinding corn, and in the construction of their boats. The forests are so impenetrable that the land is <b>nowhere</b> cultivated except <b>near</b> the coast and on the adjoining islets. Even where paths exist, they are scarcely passable from the soft and swampy state of the soil. The inhabitants, like those of Tierra del Fuego, move about chiefly on the beach or in boats. Although with plenty to eat, the people are very poor: there is no demand for labour, and consequently the lower orders cannot scrape together money sufficient to purchase even the smallest luxuries. There is also a great deficiency of a circulating medium. I have seen a man bringing on his back a bag of charcoal, with which to buy some trifle, and another carrying a plank to exchange for a bottle of wine. Hence every tradesman must also be a merchant, and again sell the goods which he takes in exchange.|$|R
