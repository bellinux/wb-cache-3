5|$|AMD chose a {{different}} direction, designing the less radical x86-64, a 64-bit extension {{to the existing}} x86 architecture, which Microsoft then supported, forcing Intel to introduce the same extensions in its own x86-based processors. These designs can run existing 32-bit applications at native hardware speed, while offering support for 64-bit memory addressing and other enhancements to <b>new</b> <b>applications.</b> This architecture has now become the predominant 64-bit architecture in the desktop and portable market. Although some Itanium-based workstations were initially introduced by companies such as SGI, {{they are no longer}} available.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, one John Holland of Cincinnati {{discovered}} {{the ability to}} melt and make castings of iridium by fusing the white-hot ore with phosphorus, and patented the process in the United States. He invoked the help of Dudley in {{getting rid of the}} phosphorus, who did so by repeated applications of lime at great heat. This was the first reported method of refining iridium. Dudley then found <b>new</b> <b>applications</b> for iridium, and formed the American Iridium Company with Holland. Dudley filed a patent on his method for iridium electroplating in 1887.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2007, Enterprise Library 3.0 was released. It {{contains}} <b>new</b> <b>Application</b> Blocks, a <b>new</b> <b>Application</b> Block Software factory {{designed to}} simplify the development of <b>new</b> <b>Application</b> Blocks and extensions, and new features providing better integration with [...]NET Framework 3.0.

40|$|State of the Art: Many organic {{pesticides}} {{have reduced}} effectiveness due to UV degradation. <b>New</b> <b>application</b> techniques (e. g. under-leaf application) could help {{to solve this}} problem in organic vegetable production. Definition of the problem: All microbial biocontrol agents and pesticides of vegetal origin are UV degraded. <b>New</b> <b>application</b> technology could augment effectiveness of these products. Project aims: Find <b>new</b> <b>application</b> technologies for a more adapted application of organic pesticides and microbial biocontrol agents in organic vegetable production. Methodology: On-farm test of different <b>new</b> <b>application</b> techniques and with different pesticide agents...|$|R
50|$|Once {{the track}} to Fridhemsberg had been {{finished}} a <b>new</b> <b>application</b> was filed. The <b>new</b> <b>application</b> {{was for a}} stretch between Fridhemsberg and Älvsered. It was granted on 17 May 1895. The men behind the proposed Varberg-Månsarp route opposed the <b>new</b> <b>application,</b> {{but it was still}} granted as they {{had not been able to}} secure enough capital to build the railway. However, a number of restrictions were put in place, in the Varberg-Månsarp route was to be built.|$|R
5|$|Since 1971, the Republic of China (Taiwan) {{has been}} {{excluded}} from the UN and since then has always been rejected in <b>new</b> <b>applications.</b> Citizens of this country are also not allowed to enter the buildings of the United Nations with the passport of Taiwan. In this way, critics agree that the UN is failing its own development goals and guidelines. This criticism also brought pressure from the People's Republic of China, which regards the territories administered by Taiwan as their own territory.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of electric power, wind power found <b>new</b> <b>applications</b> in lighting buildings remote from centrally-generated power. Throughout the 20th century parallel paths developed small wind stations suitable for farms or residences, and larger utility-scale wind generators that could be connected to electric power grids for remote use of power. Today wind powered generators operate in every size range between tiny stations for battery charging at isolated residences, up to near-gigawatt sized offshore wind farms that provide electric power to national electrical networks.|$|E
5|$|Gateshead Harriers are an {{athletic}} club based at Gateshead International Stadium. Founded in 1904 as Gateshead St Mary's Church Running Club, they were initially a men-only club until allowing {{the admission of}} women in 1951. The club moved to the Gateshead Youth Stadium in 1956, making the Harriers the stadium's oldest tenant. In 2006 they won promotion to the first division of the British Athletics League and were the only club from the north-east of England to compete at that level. After a six-year stay in the division, the Harriers were relegated to division two in August 2012 after failing to win enough points at the final meet of the season at Eton to prevent a bottom-two league finish. Club officials received over 100 <b>new</b> <b>applications</b> {{for membership in the}} aftermath of the 2012 London Olympics.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{way that}} {{companies}} use ETL {{is to move}} information to another application permanently. For instance, the <b>new</b> <b>application</b> might use another database vendor and most likely a very different database schema. ETL {{can be used to}} transform the data into a format suitable for the <b>new</b> <b>application</b> to use.|$|R

5|$|The {{dominant}} {{industrial use}} of diamond is in cutting, drilling, grinding, and polishing. Most of these applications {{do not require}} large diamonds; in fact, most diamonds of gem-quality except for their small size can be used industrially. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades, or ground into a powder for use in grinding and polishing applications. Specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for high pressure experiments (see diamond anvil cell), high-performance bearings, and limited use in specialized windows. With the continuing advances {{in the production of}} synthetic diamonds, <b>new</b> <b>applications</b> are becoming feasible. Garnering much excitement is the possible use of diamond as a semiconductor suitable for microchips, and because of its exceptional heat conductance property, as a heat sink in electronics.|$|E

25|$|KLM started KLM AirCares, {{a program}} that aids {{underprivileged}} children in developing countries to which KLM flies, in 1999. The airline collects money and airmiles from passengers. In 2012, <b>new</b> <b>applications</b> for support from the program were suspended because it needed an overhaul.|$|E
25|$|Today the bivector {{is largely}} studied as a topic in {{geometric}} algebra, a Clifford algebra over real or complex vector spaces with a nondegenerate quadratic form.

25|$|In 1984, {{although}} {{he had not yet}} reached retirement age, he resigned his professorship over differences in the teaching of mathematical analysis, feeling that his academic freedom was under threat. He did, however, remain active in mathematics: for example, he brought out a second edition of Geometry of Numbers along with Peter Grüber. This field now found <b>new</b> <b>applications</b> in coding theory.|$|E
25|$|While the JamesonCell {{continued}} {{to expand in}} base metals concentrate cleaning, SX–EW electrolyte cleaning and coal fines recovery applications, it also found <b>new</b> <b>applications</b> in cleaning potash slimes and {{was adopted by the}} Philex Mining Corporation as the sole flotation machine for its Benguet copper concentrator. This is not the normal application for the Cell. No other metals concentrator operates solely using Jameson Cells.|$|E
25|$|Chromium 29.0 was {{released}} on 9 May 2013, with the initial release version 29.0.1502.0. This development cycle resulted in the release of Chrome 29.0.1547.57 on 20 August 2013.
