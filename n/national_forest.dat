5|$|The listed <b>National</b> <b>Forest</b> names {{represent}} the current management {{divisions of the}} <b>National</b> <b>Forest</b> System. Forests that are managed separately, such as Allegheny <b>National</b> <b>Forest</b> and Monongahela <b>National</b> <b>Forest,</b> are listed as separate forests. But forests that are managed together {{may or may not}} be listed separately. Forests managed together and with hyphenated names, such as Salmon-Challis <b>National</b> <b>Forest,</b> are considered to be a single <b>National</b> <b>Forest.</b> Forests that are managed together under titles such as Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison National Forests, are considered to be separate forests. National Forests listed in this column in small text are constituent National Forests managed by, but not included in the name of, the named <b>National</b> <b>Forest</b> in normal text. If you are counting to reach 154 National Forests, count hyphenated names as two forests, with the exception of Manti-La Sal, which is the official name of one forest. Uinta-Wasatch-Cache is counted as three and George Washington and Jefferson is counted as two.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{national}} forests and wildlife preserves—including the Klamath <b>National</b> <b>Forest,</b> Six Rivers <b>National</b> <b>Forest,</b> Klamath National Wildlife Refuges Complex, and Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge—are {{located in the}} Klamath River watershed. The Klamath <b>National</b> <b>Forest</b> is located in Siskiyou County with a small portion in Oregon, and Six Rivers <b>National</b> <b>Forest</b> {{is located in the}} southern Klamath watershed, mostly in the Trinity River watershed. The latter two are located in the Upper Klamath Lake-Lower Klamath Lake area. Lava Beds National Monument, which contains a large array of lava tubes and formations, is also in the Lower Klamath Lake area, to the south of the remnants of the lake.|$|E

40|$|Offshore oil {{drilling}} has been controversial in California for decades. Oil drilling in <b>national</b> <b>forests</b> has never {{received the same}} kind of attention, but because of the Bush administration’s decision to increase oil development in the <b>national</b> <b>forests,</b> attention is likely to increase. This paper examines public opinion regarding {{oil drilling}} in California’s forests. We find that attitudes toward drilling for oil in <b>national</b> <b>forests</b> are similar to attitudes toward offshore oil drilling. This implies that oil drilling in the <b>national</b> <b>forests</b> can easily develop into a national controversy...|$|R
