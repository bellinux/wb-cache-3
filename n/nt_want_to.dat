40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we have used}} western {{blotting}} to study the phosphorylation of the intracellular enzymes ERK (MAPK) and Akt {{as well as the}} EGF receptor in response to stimulation with neurotensin (NT) and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Both these substances activate signaling cascades frequently overactive in cancer. Cells from the Panc- 1 cell line, which is derived from a human ductal pancreatic carcinoma, have been used in our experiments. Previous studies have investigated ERK activation in these cells, but little is reported about Akt (PKB) phosphorylation in response <b>to</b> <b>NT</b> stimulation. We <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see whether or not NT induced transactivation of the EGF receptor and we also studied the effect of preincubation with different inhibitors in order to elucidate by which mechanisms EGF- and NT-induced phosphorylation occur. Finally, we stimulated our cells with thapsigargin or tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) to investigate the effect of increased intracellular calcium and activation of protein kinase C (PKC), respectively. Results: EGF and NT stimulated ERK- and Akt-phosphorylation in a dose dependent fashion. EGF also stimulated EGFR phosphorylation dose dependently. We detected no NT-induced transactivation of EGFR. NT- and EGF-induced Akt activation was not mediated through PKC or increased intracellular calcium. NT-induced ERK activation seemed to be PKC-dependent, whereas EGF- induced ERK activation was reduced by 50 % when inhibiting PKC...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Computer Engineering, İzmir, 1999 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 74) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishv, 74 leavesThere {{are some}} basic operations, that any Internet Service Provider (ISP) must do, such as adding, removing users, disabling and enabling users, changing user passwords etc. Beside these basic operations, all ISPs must design a accounting system to bill the users. Most of the currently available ISP packages run on Windows NT or UNIX systems and in client side a specific client program is developed, which runs only on specific operating system (OS) (say Windows <b>NT).</b> If ISP <b>want</b> <b>to</b> access these ISP operations from an another OS (say from UNIX (with hundreds of its derivatives), OS/ 2, MacOS etc.), client program must be ported {{to each of}} the OS. Although this is possible in theory, in practice it is very difficult and not cost effective. In this thesis to solve this problem, a Web based user accounting system IS proposed. In a Web based system anyone who has a regular Web browser can access the ISP data, manage and view them (ofcourse securely) no-matter where he is in the world which OS he uses. This approach makes ISP accounting easy and cost effective. Additionally making the system in Turkish, increases the useability of the system for the Turkish users...|$|R
