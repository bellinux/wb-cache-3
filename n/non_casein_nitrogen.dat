The milk was heated to 63, 80, 90 and 120 °C for 30 min. and nitrogen distribution was determined. The <b>non</b> <b>casein</b> <b>nitrogen</b> (NCN) in raw milks of camel and cow was 28 and 26 mg/lOOg, respectively. Whey protein nitrogen (WPN) was decreased significantly and after 30 min. of heating at 90 °C the whey protein denaturation of camel milk was nearly half that of cow milk. Compared to cow milk, camel milk whey proteins had higher heat stability. Camel milk exhibit poor HCT and modification of the protein level and salt composition of the milk {{similar to that of}} cow milk did not improve the HCf. Suspension of camel milk micelles in cow ultra centrifugal whey (UCW) gave a milk unstable to heat. The system consisting of serum protein free casein (SPFC) of both camel and cow milks in their own milk diffusate, SPFC of camel milk in cow milk diffusate and PFC of cow milk in camel milk diffusate, all became very unstable to heat at all pH values.

40|$|Compared to cow milk, the {{knowledge}} concerning the physico-chemical characteristics of camel milk is poor and only few publications reported {{these types of}} informations. Moreover, data are sometimes confuse and discordant between studies. Explanations concerning these discordances are differences in the geographical origin of camel milk and analytical methods used for the characterization. The objective {{of this study was}} to describe precisely the physico-chemical characteristics of fresh raw whole camel milk obtained from the Camel and Range Research Center located at Al-Jouf, Sakaka (Saudi Arabia). The collected milk came from 16 milking camels. The recovered volume, corresponding to two milking, was 150 liters. One liter of raw milk was sampled for the physico-chemical characterization. This milk was pasteurized at 70 °C during 10 minutes and one liter was also sampled for the same physico-chemical analyses. Experiments were performed in duplicate. The analyses were performed to (1) Determine the global composition of this milk (total and whey proteins, main minerals, lactose and fat); (2) Identity of the main proteins by mass spectrometry previously separated by reversed phase chromatography (3) Characterize the micellar properties of casein micelle in terms of mineralization, size, charge and hydration.

40|$|Pakistan is {{the third}} largest milk {{producer}} and second largest buffalo milk producer in the world. Buffalo milk is the second produced milk with a contribution of 12. 7 % in the world’s milk production. More than 92 % of this milk is being contributed by India and Pakistan. This milk is richer in protein particularly casein i. e. 34 - 36 g. kg- 1, equivalent to the total protein contents of cow milk. Casein represents 80 % of the total protein of both milks and find as colloidal particles called casein micelles. In buffalo milk, casein micelles are bigger in size, more mineralized and less hydrated but with similar charge as compared to its counter part cow milk (Ahmad et al, 2008 a and b). In spite of the important production of buffalo milk, the technological transformations of this milk into dairy products are very limited as compared to cow milk. Some cheeses or fermented milks like Cheddar, Mozarella, lassi and yoghurts are manufactured from this milk. Protein ingredients manufactured from buffalo milk such as caseinates associated with different minerals and purified whey proteins are absent on the dairy industrial market. One possible way to obtain these types of ingredients from buffalo milk is to use cross-flow microfiltration. This operation is widely used in the dairy industry for the fractionation of casein micelles and whey proteins from cow milk (Maubois, 1991; Saboya and Maubois, 2000; Nelson and Barbano, 2005). This process produces a retentate enriched in casein micelles with a purity expressed as the ratio [casein]/[total protein] higher than 0. 90 (Fauquant et al, 1988; Pierre et al, 1992; Schuck et al, 1994). The technological behaviours of these purified casein micelles during acidification, rennet coagulation and heat treatment are also very similar to milk. For these reasons, these casein micelles purified by cross-flow microfiltration are considered as native. The objectives of this work were to apply cross-flow microfiltration (0. 1 µm) firstly, to have bacteria free buffalo milk without any heat treatment, secondly to isolate and characterize the casein micelles from buffalo milk. For this purpose, cream and bacteria from milks were removed at 50 °C through a cream separator and microfiltration (1. 4 µm), respectively. Casein micelles were then separated and concentrated through cross-flow microfiltration (0. 1 µm) followed by purification through four volume water and again concentrated through water removal. Purification was performed in three main steps: concentration of casein micelles, diafiltration of retentate and final concentration (Fig. 1). The products obtained at different steps of the process were analysed for pH, total solids, proteins fractions, minerals contents and as well for size, zeta potential and hydration of casein micelles. Figure 1 : Technological scheme for the purification of casein micelles from buffalo and cow milk by cross-microfiltrations (pore size of 1. 4 and 0. 1 μm). Microbiological analyses of raw skimmed milk and bacteria free milk after the first microfiltration (1. 4 µm) showed a great reduction of coliforms and FMAR in both milks (Table 1) so the first objective was well achieved. Table 1 : Coliforms and FMAR counts Milk Coliforms FMAR Raw buffalo skimmed milk 3. 3 × 101 7. 5 × 101 Microfiltered buffalo milk < 1 1. 5 × 101 Raw cow skimmed milk 9. 7 × 104 3. 2 × 104 Microfiltered cow milk < 1 6. 5 × 101 As the second objective {{of this study was}} to purify casein micelles from buffalo milk by cross-flow microfiltration, so the results have been described and discussed for each step during the process. The biochemical compositions and physico-chemical characteristics of initial bacteria-free skimmed milks and the different retentates (intermediate, diafiltered and final) have been reported as under. Results obtained with buffalo milk were compared to cow milk and discussed. Bacteria-free skimmed milks: The contents in total protein and casein were higher for buffalo milk than that of cow milk. However, in both milks, casein content as compared to the total protein content corresponded to similar percentage i. e. 80 %. To know more about the differences in the composition between buffalo and cow milk, it was interesting to compare the different ratios. The ratios [total protein]/[total solid], [casein]/[total solid] and [casein]/[whey protein] were 0. 41, 0. 35 and 5. 3 for buffalo milk and 0. 35, 0. 27 and 4. 5 for cow milk, respectively. From these ratios, it is evident that the protein contents of buffalo milk were different than that of cow milk. The total and micellar calcium (Ca) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) concentrations were higher in buffalo milk than in cow milk as also observed by Ahmad et al. (2008 a). The pH values of both milks were close to pH 6. 7. The size of casein micelles from buffalo milk was higher, the zeta potential was similar and the micellar hydration was lower than that of cow milk and as described by Ahmad et al. (2008 a). Intermediate retentates: The contents in total protein and casein were increased for both intermediate retentates in comparison with initial skimmed milks. A slight retention of whey proteins in the intermediate retentate for cow milk compared to buffalo milk was observed. The ratios [total protein]/[total solid] increased up to 0. 54 and 0. 57 for intermediate retentates of buffalo and cow milk, respectively. At the same time, the ratios [casein]/[whey proteins] increased from about 5 for both initial milks to about 10 for both intermediate retentates. These calculated ratios indicated that the purifications of casein micelles were in progress in a similar way for both milks. The total Ca and Pi concentrations increased by 1. 7 and 1. 6 times for intermediate retentates of buffalo milk, and by 2. 3 and 2. 1 times for intermediate retentates of cow milk, respectively in comparison with milks. As discussed with the non protein nitrogen compounds, minerals and ions H+ were also able to pass through the membrane and consequently their concentrations were the same in retentate and permeate. Diafiltered retentates: The contents in <b>non</b> <b>casein</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> non protein nitrogen, whey protein, Ca and Pi were strongly reduced. During the diafiltration, the major part of the soluble compounds present in the aqueous phase of retentates like lactose, minerals, whey proteins and small molecules were removed. The concentration of whey proteins was lower in diafiltered retentate of buffalo milk than that of cow milk. This difference indicated that the whey proteins of buffalo milk were more easily transmitted than cow milk. On the other hand, the contents in total solids of these diafiltered retentates were strongly reduced. During diafiltration, 50. 3 and 54. 5 g. kg- 1 of total solid contents was removed from buffalo and cow milk, respectively. At the end of diafiltration, the total solid corresponded essentially to casein micelles containing minerals. These ratios indicated that diafiltration was particularly efficient to increase the level of purity of casein micelles for both milks. At the same time, the ratios [casein]/[whey proteins] were about 42. 3 and 26. 7 for diafiltered retentates of buffalo and cow milk, respectively suggesting a good and best elimination of the whey proteins in the diafiltered retentates of buffalo milk in comparison with those of cow milk. The pH values of both diafiltered retentates increased in a similar way by about 0. 6 units. The reduction of the ionic strength and especially Pi and citrate from the aqueous phase due to the diafiltration explained theses increases in pH. Indeed, these ions contribute to the buffering capacity of milk and their removals during the diafiltration step led to an increase in pH. The micellar characteristics of both diafiltered retentates were affected in comparison with those determined for milks and intermediate retentates. The zeta potentials of casein micelles from both retentates were more negative after diafiltration. These were related to the increase in pH and to the reduction in the ionic concentration of the aqueous phase induced by diafiltration. Final retentates: The contents in total solid, total protein and casein were increased in comparison with the corresponding intermediate and diafiltered retentates. The ratios [total protein]/[total solid] were 0. 86 and 0. 89 for final retentates of buffalo and cow milk, respectively. For the cow milk, the ratio obtained in this work was in accordance with the published values of 0. 84 (Pouliot et al., 1994), 0. 86 - 0. 88 (Pierre et al., 1992) and 0. 90 (Schuck et al., 1994). The ratios [casein]/[total solid], [casein]/[total protein] and [casein]/[whey protein] were 0. 84, 0. 98 and 45 for final retentate of buffalo milk against 0. 86, 0. 96 and 27 for final retentate of cow milk. The last calculated ratio confirmed the slight retention of whey proteins for cow milk compared to buffalo milk. Two possible reasons can explain this difference of filtration. Firstly, the composition and structures of the whey proteins from buffalo milk are different and consequently their capacities to be microfiltered were also different. The other reason concerns the formation of a fouling layer at the membrane surface during filtration. These different calculated ratios showed that the level of purification of casein micelles of buffalo milk by cross-flow microfiltration was correct and satisfactory. 98 - 99 % of Ca and Pi were associated to casein micelles in both final retentates. Micellar zeta potentials were always more negative as compared to casein micelles of milks because the aqueous phase became very poor in minerals. Conclusions: This study showed that the safe and microbial free buffalo milk can be obtained through cross-flow microfiltration without involving heat and without modifying the nature and nutritional quality of milk. So microfiltration can be considered as a processing technology to have safe, sure buffalo dairy products with their natural quality. It also showed that purification of casein micelles from buffalo milk was possible like cow milk without any major problem. The biochemical analyses of the final retentate of buffalo milk showed that it contained mainly casein and minerals and that the different compounds present in the aqueous phase were well removed. These ingredients can be used in different formulations for Ca and phosphate enrichments...|$|E

An 18 -month-long experiment {{was carried out}} on a jennet farm near Milo (CT), where 24 jennets, which derived from the Ragusana breed, were tested for milk yield and composition over an entire lactation period. The jennets were fed with hay and concentrate in a large paddock. From the 28 th post-foaling day {{to the end of}} the lactation, the jennets were machine-milked twice a day with an in-between milking interval of 5 h. The milk amount from each jennet was recorded every 3 weeks and individual samples were collected and analyzed for fat, protein, <b>casein,</b> non-proteic <b>nitrogen,</b> lactose and somatic cell count. This study showed that jennets at Sicilian latitudes are not seasonal polyestrous. The daily milk yield, the length of lactation and the milk characteristics varied depending on the foaling season. The total average milk production was 490636 kg in 295612 post-foaling days, considering two milking records per day. During the lactation, milk yield decreased constantly from 1. 98 to 1. 28 kg/jennet per day. When looking at the jennet milk quality during lactation, the percentage of fat and protein decreased, while the lactose percentage increased, according to a tendency apparently unique for equines when compared to the ruminants. When looking at the productive season, spring generally gave the best qualitative and quantitative results. Based on these results, jennet milk yield and quality could be improved; furthermore, jennet milk production may turn out to be a profitable business...|$|R
40|$|The {{tolerance}} of nickel by Frankia in culture and in symbiosis with Alnus was determined. Yield of three Frankia strains was not affected significantly by 2. 25 mM nickel when cultured in propionate medium containing hydolysed <b>casein</b> as <b>nitrogen</b> source. Yield of two strains in medium without combined nitrogen, and thus reliant on fixed nitrogen, was stimulated markedly {{by the same}} nickel concentration. Utilisation of nickel for synthesis of uptake hydrogenases is presumed to {{be the cause of}} enhanced nitrogenase activity. Although growth was reduced, treatment of 2 -month-old seedlings with 0. 025 mM nickel for 4 weeks did not affect nodulation significantly while nitrogenase activity was doubled. Nodulation and nitrogenase activity of seedlings receiving 0. 075 mM nickel were inhibited markedly, while 0. 5 mM nickel was lethal to all seedlings after 4 weeks of treatment. A few small, ineffective nodules were initiated early on some of the latter seedlings, suggesting that effects of nickel on host plant processes rather than Frankia are the primary cause of inhibition of nodulation. This interpretation is supported by the retention of substantial nitrogenase activity in 10 -month-old plants 1 day after the treatment with 0. 59 mM nickel, when the nickel content of roots and nodules was already maximal. No nitrogenase activity was detected after 3 days, by which time the leaves were almost completely necrotic. Over a 4 day period, most nickel was retained in the roots and nodules. Supplying histidine simultaneously at concentrations equal to, or in excess of, nickel prevented wilting and leaf necrosis, but did not increase translocation of nickel to the shoot...|$|R
40|$|Research was {{conducted}} in eight commercial herds located {{in the state of}} Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. Properties were classified according to the production system, the seasons were divided into four and the genetic groups into six. Milk samples from morning milking were collected monthly, directly from a cooling tank. Protein, fat, lactose, total solids, <b>casein,</b> urea <b>nitrogen</b> concentrations/levels, somatic cell count (SCC) and total bacterial count (TBC) were determined. For milk composition, the detected results were satisfactory and met the requirements of Normative Ruling 62, but the averages for SCC and TBC were above the recommended limit. All variables, with the exception of casein from total protein were influenced (P < 0. 05) by the production system used in the production unit. A lower fat content was recorded in 2010 compared to 2011. For the seasons, all the constituents of milk had lower values in drier season (seasons 3 and 4), with the exception of casein; SCC and TBC had higher values in periods 1 and 2, which are considered rainy periods. There was variation in the chemical composition of milk according to the genotypes. Milk chemical composition met the legal and market requirements, with a positive emphasis on specialized production systems. The variations over the year and according to the genetic group of the herd are also significant and should be taken into account in the search for improvements. As for the hygiene and health aspects of milk, the results portray the need for a greater focus by the entities involved in the sector, as well as the producers, on the viability of an adequacy program and monitoring of management practices related to this criterion...|$|R
40|$|A mutant of fast milk-coagulating (Fmc+) Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis C 2, {{designated}} L. lactis KB 4, was identified. Although {{possessing the}} known components essential for utilizing <b>casein</b> as a <b>nitrogen</b> source, which include functional proteinase (PrtP) activity and oligopeptide, di- and tripeptide, and amino acid transport systems, KB 4 exhibited a slow milk coagulation (Fmc−) phenotype. When the amino acid requirements of L. lactis C 2 {{were compared with}} those of KB 4 by use of a chemically defined medium, it was found that KB 4 was unable to grow in the absence of aspartic acid. This aspartic acid requirement could also be met by aspartate-containing peptides. The addition of aspartic acid to milk restored the Fmc+ phenotype of KB 4. KB 4 was found to be defective in pyruvate carboxylase and thus was deficient in the ability to form oxaloacetate and hence aspartic acid from pyruvate and carbon dioxide. The results suggest that when lactococci are propagated in milk, aspartate derived from casein is unable to meet fully the nutritional demands of the lactococci, and they become dependent upon aspartate biosynthesis...|$|R

The average total protein, whey protein, <b>casein</b> and non-protein <b>nitrogen</b> contents of fresh milk were 3. 1 ± 0. 14 %, 2. 24 ± 0. 16 %, 2. 0 ± 0. 01 % and 0. 22 ± 0. 01 %, respectively. A comparison of {{free amino acid}} profiles of fresh milk indicates that the fermentation causes increase in accumul-ation of these free amino acids. In addition, the fermentation increases the availa-bility of some free amino acids, particularly histidine, isoleucine and methionine.

40|$|The {{culture of}} Group A {{hemolytic}} streptococcus in defined media {{is a problem}} which has interested many workers {{for a number of}} years. In addition to complex requirements as to amino acids, vitamins, and purine-pyrimidine bases, Group A streptococci require the presence of material such as blood serum or tissue extract for vigorous growth from small inocula, capable of repeated subcultivation. A possible indication of the chemical nature of the active principal was obtained by Woolley (1) who showed that a non-dialyzable, water-soluble material from liver extract was required for the growth of several strains of Group A hemolytic streptococci.

40|$|Protease-negative {{variants}} {{were shown}} to outcompete the wild-type strains of Streptococcus cremoris E 8, HP, and Wg 2 at pH values higher than 6. 0 in milk. For S. cremoris E 8 this process was studied in more detail. At lower pH values the wild type had a selective advantage. This pH-dependent selection was not found in all media tested. The poor growth of the protease-negative variant at low pH was not due to lower internal pH values. By growing S. cremoris E 8 and Wg 2 in acidified milk (pH 5. 9) the proteolytic activity of the cultures could be stabilized. In continuous cultures under amino acid limitation the wild type S. cremoris E 8 and HP strains had a selective advantage over the protease-negative variants at low dilution rates (D < 0. 2) at all pH values of the medium. This was apparently due to a lower affinity-constant (Ks) of the protease-positive variants for amino acids. Finally, a high fraction of protease-positive variants could be maintained in continuous cultures by using a growth medium with low concentrations of <b>casein</b> as a <b>nitrogen</b> source. At high dilution rates nearly all cells were protease positive...|$|R

To address this issue in herbivorous insects, I studied the direct and interactive effects of thermal regime (constant vs. fluctuating temperatures) and nutrition (dietary nitrogen) on gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) performance under laboratory conditions. Predictions for differences between constant and fluctuating thermal conditions were derived from Jensen’s inequality, and artificial diets of differing nutritional quality were made by modifying <b>nitrogen</b> (<b>casein)</b> content. Larvae were reared in the laboratory under four temperature regimes (22 °C constant, 22 °C fluctuating (± 6 °C), 28 °C constant, and 28 °C fluctuating (± 6 °C)) and two diet treatments (high N, and low N). Gravimetric analyses were also conducted to calculate nutritional indices and assess the short-term effects {{of temperature}} and diet quality on fourth instar larvae growth efficiencies. Consistent with predictions from Jensen’s inequality, fluctuating thermal conditions significantly reduced larval performance in both sexes across ontogeny. Low quality diet also reduced performance, but interactions between diet and thermal regime were only found in early instars...|$|R
40|$|Plants foster diverse assemblages of {{bacteria}} in the rhizosphere serving important functions which may result in enhanced plant growth. Microbial diversity is increasingly recognized to shape the functionality of microbial communities. This leads to the assumption {{that there is a}} positive relationship between rhizosphere diversity and plant growth. Here we investigate how bacterial diversity affects the mineralization of organic matter and plant nutrient acquisition. We hypothesized that altered bacterial diversity will affect nitrogen mineralisation, uptake by plants and ultimately plant growth. We set up a controlled model system with Arabidopsis thaliana colonized by defined assemblages of fluorescent pseudomonads, a well-characterised plant-beneficial rhizosphere taxon. The growth substrate contained <b>casein</b> as sole <b>nitrogen</b> source, making the plant nitrogen uptake dependant on breakdown by bacterial enzymes. Bacterial diversity was associated with a higher enzyme activity which increased nitrogen mineralization and enhanced plant growth. The effect {{of bacteria}}l diversity on plant growth increased with time, pointing to a positive feedback between bacteria and plants: Bigger plants associated with species-rich bacterial communities supported more bacterial growth, which further enhanced the impact of bacteria on plant growth. We demonstrate that plant-soil feedbacks establish rapidly during one single growth season and that bacterial diversity modulates this interaction. Preserving soil microbial diversity therefore may improve positive plant-soil feedbacks and thereby plant growth.

40|$|Abstract: Exopolysaccharides like dextran {{produced}} by different microorganisms {{have a wide}} range of applications in the food, pharmaceutical and other industries. Dextran and its derivatives like iron dextran, clinical dextran, food grade dextran are rapidly emerging as new and industrially significant products. Dextran a polymer of glucose is produced using sucrose rich media and also requires efficient nitrogen sources for production. In the present study diverse organic nitrogen sources like yeast extract, soya bean meal, meat extract, beef extract, casein hydrolysate, bacterial peptone, corn steep liquor, inorganic nitrogen sources like sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate, ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulphate, ammonium phosphate and natural nitrogen sources like Bengal gram, red gram, black gram, green gram, horse gram, soybeans, cow pea were screened using statistical design like Plackett-Burman. An eight experimental design of Plackett-Burman was used and seven sources were screened. Broth analysis indicated presence of more fructose and less glucose. Dextran was recovered from broth by alcohol precipitation. The results indicated that there was higher dextran production in organic <b>nitrogen</b> sources like <b>casein</b> hydrolysate, natural <b>nitrogen</b> sources like black gram. Though inorganic nitrogen sources did not show good yield, but comparatively ammonium sulphate gave a positive response.

The main objectives were {{to determine the}} nutritional requirements and conditions which promoted EP production by strain nyx. Strain nyx was grown anaerobically in defined and semidefined media. In addition to carbohydrate and nitrogen sources, strain nyx required acetic acid, folic acid, biotin, and pyridoxamine. Strain nyx produced similar amounts of EP at 35 to 40 °C. Conditions that improved growth usually improved EP production. Of the carbohydrates tested, glucose supported the fastest growth and most EP production, followed by sucrose, xylose, and lactose. Strain nyx utilized ammonium sulfate, urea, or vitamin-free <b>casein</b> hydrolysate as <b>nitrogen</b> sources for growth and EP production. At 2 and 20 g/liter, respectively, ammonium sulfate and vitamin-free casein hydrolysate supported about the same rates of growth and EP production. EP was not produced in the lag or stationary phases, and EP production was exponential during exponential cell growth. Based {{on the results of}} this work, anaerobic EP production with B. fibrisolvens nyx could reduce energy costs for industrial EP production compared with the cost of aerated systems.

30|$|To characterise {{the growth}} in minimal and defined medium, we studied the effect of {{different}} carbon and nitrogen sources on the growth of halophilic bacterial isolates. It was observed that Minimal medium (M 9) containing glucose as a carbon source and ammonium chloride as a nitrogen source did not support growth {{of any of the}} halophilic isolates (Table  1). More importantly, growth was also not observed when ammonium chloride was replaced with urea or yeast extract as a nitrogen source. The addition of casein hydrolysate as a nitrogen source supported the growth of all the halophilic isolates (Table  1). Since glucose as carbon source and casein hydrolysate as a nitrogen source supported the growth of all the bacterial isolates, we studied the effect of different carbon sources in M 9 medium supplemented with <b>casein</b> hydrolysate as <b>nitrogen</b> source. Very surprisingly, none of the bacterial isolates, except SS 5, showed growth when glucose, starch, sucrose, fructose, trehalose, glycerol, lactose, raffinose, galactose or sorbitol was supplemented as carbon source (Table  1). All halophilic isolates showed growth in presence of peptone and beef extract except isolate SS 3. (Table  1). Together, these results indicate a complex requirement of carbon and nitrogen sources by the halophilic bacterial isolates of Lunsu.

The objectives of this study were to determine similarities of mare’s milk in comparison with milk of ruminants (cattle, sheep and goat) and human milk in terms of milk composition and protein fraction as whey proteins, caseins and micelles size. All differences were discussed regarding usage of mare’s milk in human diet and compared to milk which is usually used in human nutrition. Regarding composition, the mare’s milk is similar to human milk in of crude protein, salt and lactose content, but it has significantly lower content of fat. Fractions of main proteins are similar between human and mare’s milk, except <b>nitrogen</b> <b>casein</b> (casein N) which has twice lower content in human than in mare’s milk. Content of casein N from all ruminants’ milk differ much more. Just for true whey N and non-protein nitrogen (NPN) similar content as human and mare’s milk has also goat milk. The casein content is the lowest in human milk; this content is three times greater in mare’s milk and six to seven times greater in goat’s and cow’s milk, while in sheep’s milk it is more than 10 times grater. In many components and fractions mare’s milk is more similar to human milk than milk of ruminants.

Only LHLPLP and HLPLP were identified in CSHs and exclusively in D. hansenii Dh 1 and Dh 14 hydrolysates in which both antihypertensive sequences represented approximately 6 (CSH Dh 1) and 10 % (CSH Dh 14) of total peptide content. In addition, a complete analysis of selected CSHs by HPLC-MS/MS allowed the identification of 35 (Dh 1) and 46 (Dh 14) additional peptides, which could also contribute to the observed in vitro ACE inhibitory potency of both hydrolysates (Dh 1, IC 50 = 13. 6 ± 1. 8 μg/mL; Dh 14, IC 50 = 17. 5 ± 2. 1 μg/mL) and might confer them multifunctional properties. Finally casein zymography revealed the presence of at least one extracellular protease with a molecular mass of about 50 kDa.

40|$|By {{modifying the}} forces (hydrophobic and {{electrostatic}} interactions, hydrogen bonding and presence of micellar calcium phosphate) {{responsible for the}} structure and the stability of casein micelles, alkalinisation induces a disruption of casein micelles in milk. The objective of this work was to compare the alkalinisation-induced physico-chemical changes of casein micelles of buffalo and cow milks with a {{special attention to the}} mineral fraction. The whiteness and viscosity were determined as global characteristics of milk. The aqueous and micellar phases of milks were ascertained for the distributions of the concentrations of <b>nitrogen,</b> <b>casein</b> molecules, calcium, inorganic phosphate and water as their supramolecular and molecular characteristics. These parameters were measured at six pH values between pH 6. 7 and 10. 8. Between pH 6. 7 and 10. 8, the whiteness decreased from 73. 5 to 50. 9 and from 71. 3 to 50. 9 units and the viscosity increased from 1. 8 to 10. 2 and from 1. 5 to 4. 8 mPa·s for buffalo and cow milks, respectively. Simultaneously, > 90 % of nitrogen contents were in the supernatants of ultracentrifugation at pH 9. 7 and 8. 6 for buffalo and cow milks, respectively. Chromatographic analyses showed that caseins were totally solubilised at these pH values. Calcium and inorganic phosphate concentrations progressively increased in the supernatants of ultracentrifugation and decreased in the ultrafiltrates. At alkaline pH, the negative charge of caseins increased and the inorganic phosphate ion changed its ionisation state from HPO 4 2 − to PO 4 3 − form. This form has a greater affinity for calcium and can demineralise casein micelles. The consequences were modifications of protein-protein and protein-minerals interactions resulting in micellar disruption. The dissociations took place at pH 9. 7 and 8. 6 for buffalo and cow milks, respectively. These differences were due to higher concentrations of casein and minerals in buffalo than in cow milk,which were also our criteria of selection of the former as a model...|$|R

The diets were formulated to obtain, with a daily intake of about 15. 5 kg of DM, a balanced energy supply but an excess of protein (diet A); the opposite occurred with diet B. The average dry matter intake recorded during the trial was 14. 5 kg for diet A and 15. 0 kg for diet B. Milk production was similar for both groups (7. 94 kg vs. 7. 95 kg). The diet with a higher protein concentration brought about {{a significant increase in}} protein, <b>casein</b> and non-protein <b>nitrogen</b> contents in the milk. A significant increase in milk fat percentage was observed when the animals were fed the diet with a higher energy concentration. The serum urea concentration (8. 62 mM/l) of buffaloes fed diet A was outside the physiological range for lactating buffaloes. The energy and protein conversion efficiencies for milk production were more favourable when their supplies were balanced: 3. 58 MJ of NEl/kg of FPCM for diet A; 2. 50 g of MP or 2. 07 g of PDI/g of protein milk for diet B. Moreover, when the requirements were satisfied, greater energy or protein supplies failed to induce significant changes in milk yield and quality.

The objective {{of this study was}} to identify the occurrence of unstable non-acid milk in the west and central mesoregions of Rio Grande do Norte, determine their physicochemical characteristics, test alcoholic graduations and evaluate their correlation with the quality of milk. 176 raw milk samples were analyzed in the period from September to December / 2014 from 23 APASA’s cooling tanks, located in 7 cities of west and central mesoregions RN. The samples were collected in duplicate, one sample used for alcohol testing at 68, 72 and 76 %, measurement of pH, acidity, electrical conductivity and boiling proof, made in LABOLEITE / UFRN; and the other sample containing Bronopol® preservative, was sent to the APCBRH (Cattle Breeders Association Paranaense Holstein) laboratory in Curitiba-PR, which were analyzed fat, protein, total solids, lactose, <b>casein,</b> urea <b>nitrogen</b> and somatic cell count. The test alcohol samples disapproved 31. 82 %, of which 30 % proved to be non-acid, and 30 % had high acidity. The samples were divided into three classes: Stable Milk, UNAM and acid milk. 3 % Tukey test was used for comparison of stable milk components and UNAM and there was no significant difference between them. Both classes obtained averages within the standard required by IN 62. The average value of electric conductivity was 4. 84 mS/cm for stable milk, 4. 55 mS/cm for unstable and acid milk and 4. 53 mS/cm for non-acid unstable milk. The electrical conductivity was positively correlated with alcohol stability of milk and negative correlation with acidity and pH. Could not observe direct relationship between the electrical conductivity and the somatic cell count. The boiling test was negative for all samples UNAM. It can be concluded that the incidence of UNAM in the studied region is low, although the predisposing factors such as heat stress, drought and nutritional deficiency. In conclusion, the UNAM has quality similar to stable milk, conform the norms required by Agriculture Ministry, and with adequate thermal stability, which proves that there is no reason to reject this milk by industry...|$|R
