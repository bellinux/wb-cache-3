5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{include both}} an estrogen and a progestogen. Estrogen negative {{feedback on the}} anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular breakthrough bleeding. Several combined hormonal contraceptives—the pill, <b>NuvaRing,</b> and the contraceptive patch—are usually used {{in a way that}} causes regular withdrawal bleeding. In a normal cycle, menstruation occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly. Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be taken continuously, although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.|$|E
2500|$|The {{contraceptive}} patch {{is applied}} to the skin and worn continuously. [...] A series of three patches are worn for one week each, and then the user takes a one-week break. [...] <b>NuvaRing</b> is worn inside the vagina. [...] A ring is worn for three weeks. [...] After removal, the user takes a one-week break before inserting a new ring. [...] As with COCPs, other regimens may be used with the contraceptive patch or <b>NuvaRing</b> to provide extended cycle combined hormonal contraception.|$|E
2500|$|Implanon: [...] Most regimens of COCPs, <b>NuvaRing,</b> and the {{contraceptive}} patch {{incorporate a}} placebo or break week that causes regular withdrawal bleeding. [...] While women using combined injectable contraceptives may experience amenorrhea (lack of periods), they typically have predictable bleeding {{comparable to that}} of women using COCPs.|$|E
2500|$|Combined {{contraceptives}} {{have also}} been made available {{in a variety of}} forms. In the 1960s a few combined injectable contraceptives were introduced, notably Injectable Number 1 in China and Deladroxate in Latin America. [...] A third combined injection, Cyclo-Provera, was reformulated in the 1980s by lowering the dose and renamed Cyclofem (also called Lunelle). [...] Cyclofem and Mesigyna, another formulation developed in the 1980s, were approved by the World Health Organization in 1993. [...] <b>NuvaRing,</b> a contraceptive vaginal ring, was first marketed in 2002. [...] 2002 also saw the launch of Ortho Evra, the first contraceptive patch.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} adverse events {{reported}} by 5 to 14% of the 2501 women who used <b>NuvaRing</b> in five clinical trials were: vaginitis (14.1%), headache (9.8%), {{upper respiratory tract}} infection (8.0%), leukorrhea (5.8%), sinusitis (5.7%), nausea (5.2%), and weight gain (4.9%). <b>NuvaRing</b> is weight neutral. Additional side effect information (including, but not limited to, severe blood clots) is provided in the <b>NuvaRing</b> full prescribing information. Breakthrough bleeding occurs in 2.0 to 6.4% of <b>NuvaRing</b> users.|$|E
50|$|<b>NuvaRing</b> - <b>NuvaRing</b> is {{inserted}} into the vagina and left in place for three weeks, after which it is removed for a 'ring-free' week to allow menstruation to occur.|$|E
50|$|<b>NuvaRing</b> {{was first}} {{approved}} in The Netherlands on February 14, 2001, then by all 14 other countries {{then in the}} European Union on June 12, 2001, and in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on October 3, 2001. <b>NuvaRing</b> was first marketed in the United States in July 2002, followed by a number European countries since then.In March 2007, Organon announced the market launch of <b>NuvaRing</b> in Australia, bringing {{the total number of}} countries where <b>NuvaRing</b> is available to 32.A study by Danish researcher Dr. Øjvind Lidegaard in 2012 with 1.6 million women found a 6.5 times increase in the likelihood of venous thromboembolism when compared to users of non-hormonal based birth control. In Canada, Lidegaard's study led to a change in labeling warning of increased risk of blood clots, but not in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Etonogestrel is marketed {{under the}} brand names Circlet, Implanon, Nexplanon, and <b>NuvaRing.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{two large}} studies, over a one-year period, 15.1% of users {{discontinued}} <b>NuvaRing</b> because of adverse events. Device-related adverse events (foreign object sensation, sexual problems, or expulsion) {{were the most}} frequently reported adverse events that resulted in discontinuation (by 2.5% of users). Device-related adverse events were reported at least once during the one-year study period by 4.4% of <b>NuvaRing</b> users.|$|E
50|$|Insertion of {{the ring}} is {{comparable}} to insertion of other vaginal rings. The muscles of the vagina keep <b>NuvaRing</b> securely in place, even during exercise or sex. Women can check the contraceptive ring periodically with their finger. In rare instances, <b>NuvaRing</b> may fall out during sexual intercourse, while straining before or during a bowel movement, or while removing a tampon.|$|E
50|$|Like all {{combined}} hormonal contraceptives, <b>NuvaRing</b> works {{primarily by}} preventing ovulation. A secondary {{mechanism of action}} is inhibition of sperm penetration by changes in the cervical mucus. Hormonal contraceptives also have effects on the endometrium that theoretically could affect implantation, however no scientific evidence indicates that prevention of implantation actually results from their use. <b>NuvaRing</b> {{should not be used}} if a woman is pregnant.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2008, {{the first}} lawsuit was {{filed against the}} manufacturers, distributors, and {{marketers}} of <b>NuvaRing.</b> The plaintiff alleged that these companies concealed the health risks associated with using the device, which is claimed to have caused {{the death of the}} plaintiff's wife. [...] Subsequent plaintiffs alleged multiple problems with the advertising of <b>NuvaRing</b> and that they downplayed its risks of injury and death. The company denied these allegations.|$|E
50|$|<b>NuvaRing</b> {{delivers}} 120 µg of etonogestrel (a progestin) and 15 µg of ethinylestradiol (an estrogen) {{each day}} of use.|$|E
5000|$|<b>NuvaRing</b> - a low-dose {{contraceptive}} vaginal ring, manufactured from poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate), {{and releasing}} etonogestrel (a progestin) ethinylestradiol (an estrogen).|$|E
50|$|Products include: Bridion, Esmirtazapine, Remeron, Remeron SolTab, Sustanon, Deca-Durabolin, Pregnyl, Implanon, <b>NuvaRing,</b> Marvelon, Desolett and {{a variety}} of other {{contraceptive}} products.|$|E
50|$|The {{contraceptive}} patch {{is applied}} to the skin and worn continuously. A series of three patches are worn for one week each, and then the user takes a one-week break. <b>NuvaRing</b> is worn inside the vagina. A ring is worn for three weeks. After removal, the user takes a one-week break before inserting a new ring. As with COCPs, other regimens may be used with the contraceptive patch or <b>NuvaRing</b> to provide extended cycle combined hormonal contraception.|$|E
50|$|<b>NuvaRing</b> {{should not}} be used while breastfeeding. The hormones may pass to the baby through the milk, and it may {{decrease}} milk production.|$|E
50|$|Ethinylestradiol/etonogestrel (brand names <b>NuvaRing)</b> is a {{contraceptive}} {{vaginal ring}} containing the estrogen ethinylestradiol and the progestin etonogestrel which is marketed in the United States and Europe.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{lawsuits}} {{have been filed}} alleging the companies involved concealed the health risks associated with using the <b>NuvaRing,</b> which are currently being settled for $100 million.|$|E
5000|$|Etonogestrel, {{sold under}} {{a number of}} brand names, is a {{progestin}} used in hormonal contraceptives, most notably the etonogestrel contraceptive implant (Nexplanon, Implanon) and the contraceptive vaginal ring (<b>NuvaRing,</b> Circlet).|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} types exist. One type is the ethinylestradiol/etonogestrel vaginal ring, {{also known as}} <b>NuvaRing.</b> It is a {{flexible}} plastic (ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer) ring that releases a low dose of a progestin and estrogen over three weeks. It is currently used by approximately 1.5 million women worldwide.|$|E
50|$|<b>NuvaRing</b> {{also has}} the {{cardiovascular}} contraindications associated with combined oral contraceptives, such as stroke and heart attack. These risks {{have been shown to}} be much greater if combined with other risk factors such as smoking, recent surgery, a history of cardiovascular disease, or women over 40 years old.|$|E
50|$|Other {{combined}} hormonal contraceptives (those containing both an {{estrogen and}} a progestogen) {{may also be}} used in an extended or continuous cycle. For example, the <b>NuvaRing</b> vaginal ring and the contraceptive patch have been studied for extended cycle use, and the monthly combined injectable contraceptive may similarly eliminate bleeding.|$|E
5000|$|While {{unpredictable}} {{breakthrough bleeding}} {{is a possible}} side effect for all hormonal contraceptives, it is more common with progestogen-only formulations. [...] Most regimens of COCPs, <b>NuvaRing,</b> and the contraceptive patch incorporate a placebo or break week that causes regular withdrawal bleeding. While women using combined injectable contraceptives may experience amenorrhea (lack of periods), they typically have predictable bleeding {{comparable to that of}} women using COCPs.|$|E
5000|$|On July 31, 2014, CTV News {{reported}} that Merck Canada Inc. stated {{that women who}} are over 35 and smoke should not use the <b>Nuvaring.</b> In addition to this group of women, women who {{have any of the}} following conditions also should not use the Nuvaring: abnormal blood-fat levels, clotting disorders, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, migraine headaches with vision problems or [...] "constant stomach pain caused by pancreatic dysfunction along with high levels of fats in the blood".|$|E
50|$|Etonogestrel is {{the active}} {{metabolite}} of the inactive prodrug desogestrel, {{one of two}} third-generation progestins found in some epidemiological studies of combined oral contraceptive pills {{to be associated with}} a higher risk of venous thrombosis than combined oral contraceptive pills containing certain second-generation progestins. Because hormones are released continuously from <b>NuvaRing,</b> peak and total estrogen and progestin doses are significantly lower than with combined oral contraceptives, although it is not known whether this lowers the risk of blood clots. It is effective within the first 8 hours of insertion.|$|E

[...] Epidemiological {{studies have shown that}} oral contraceptives that contain desogestrel can increase the risk of blood clots (venous thrombosis) by 1.5 to 2.4 times the risk of second-generation oral contraceptives. [...] Second-generation oral contraceptives do not contain desogestrel. Hormones are released continuously from <b>NuvaRing,</b> thus peak and total estrogen and progestin doses are significantly lower than with combined oral contraceptives, but what effect this has on the risk of blood clots has not been established.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{bellwether}} trial, {{selected from}} a pool of federal lawsuits, was scheduled to begin on April 7, 2014. [...] On February 6, 2014, however, Merck & Co announced that it was ready to settle the <b>NuvaRing</b> lawsuits for $100 million. At that time, there were more than 1,850 lawsuits and the settlement was initially estimated pay about $58,000 per complaint. Approval of the settlement required 95% of the plaintiffs to agree to settle {{by the end of the}} day, March 10, 2014, otherwise Merck could retract their offer. On June 5, 2014 US District Judge Rodney W. Sippel approved the $100 million settlement. About 3,800 claimants would share the settlement.|$|E
5000|$|EE {{has been}} marketed as a {{standalone}} oral drug under the brand names Esteed, Estinyl, Feminone, Lynoral, Menolyn, Novestrol, Palonyl, Spanestrin, and Ylestrol among others, although {{most or all}} of these formulations are now discontinued. It is marketed under {{a very large number of}} brand names throughout the world in combination with progestins for use as an oral contraceptive. In addition, EE is marketed in the [...] in combination with norelgestromin under the brand names Ortho Evra and Xulane as a contraceptive patch, in combination with etonogestrel under the brand name <b>NuvaRing</b> as a contraceptive vaginal ring, and in combination with norethisterone acetate under the brand name FemHRT in oral hormone replacement therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} types of {{contraceptive}} methods available. Hormonal methods which contain the hormones estrogen and progestin include oral contraceptive pills (there is also a progestin only pill), transdermal patch (OrthoEvra), and intravaginal ring (<b>NuvaRing).</b> Progestin only methods include an injectable form (Depo-Provera), a subdermal implant (Nexplanon), and the intrauterine device (Mirena). Non-hormonal contraceptive methods include the copper intrauterine device (ParaGard), male and female condoms, male and female sterilization, cervical diaphragms and sponges, spermicides, withdrawal, and fertility awareness. [...] In 2006-2008, the most popular contraceptive methods among those at risk of unintended pregnancy were oral contraceptive pills (25%), female sterilization (24.2%), male condoms (14.5%) and male sterilization (8.8%). [...] Intrauterine device (4.9%), Withdrawal (4.6%). Depo-Provera is used by 2.9%, primarily younger women (7.5% of those 15-19 and about 4.5% of those 20-30).|$|E
50|$|Vaginal {{rings are}} easily {{inserted}} and removed. Vaginal walls {{hold them in}} place. Although their exact location within the vagina is not critical for clinical efficacy, rings commonly reside next to the cervix, and the deeper the placement in the vagina, the less likely the ring will be felt. Rings are typically left in place during intercourse, and most couples report no interference or discomfort. In many cases, neither partner feels {{the presence of the}} ring. Rings can be removed prior to intercourse, but, {{in the case of the}} contraceptive <b>NuvaRing,</b> only for one to three hours to maintain efficacy of birth control. If the ring is out for more than 48 hours, back up contraception is necessary for seven days. It typically takes between one and two months for a user's cycle to return to normal after the use of a vaginal ring is stopped.|$|E
50|$|The {{possibility}} of the subdermal contraceptive implant began when silicone was discovered in the 1940s and found to be bio-compatible with the human body.In 1964, Folkman and Long published the first study demonstrating that such a rod {{could be used to}} deliver drugs.In 1966 Dziuk and Cook published a study that looked at release rates and suggested that the rods could be well suited for contraception. After a study that used implants with progestogens for contraception, the Population Council developed and patented Norplant and Jadelle. Norplant has six rods and is considered a first generation implant. Jadelle (Norplant II) and other single rod implants that followed were developed because of complications resulting from Norplants 6 rod system. The Jadelle system contains two silicone rods mixed with levonorgestrel. In 1990 De Nijs patented a co-axial extrusion technique of ethylene vinylacetate copolymers and 3-keto-desogestrel (etonogestrel) for the preparation of long-acting contraceptive devices, such as Implanon, Nexplanon and <b>Nuvaring.</b> The single rods were less visible under the skin and used etonogestrel as opposed to levonorgestrel in the hopes that it would reduce side effects.|$|E

Eighty-seven women started the study, 44 with <b>NuvaRing</b> and 43 with the LNG/EE oral contraceptive. For most procoagulation variables, {{there was no difference}} between <b>NuvaRing</b> and oral LNG/EE; only Factor VII levels increased in the <b>NuvaRing</b> group and decreased in the LNG/EE group. The majority of assessed variables show that anticoagulation and fibrinolytic activity was comparable between the <b>NuvaRing</b> and oral LNG/EE groups. Antithrombin activity and protein C activity both tended to be higher with <b>NuvaRing.</b> Levels of tissue plasminogen activator decreased in both groups but the reduction was smaller with <b>NuvaRing.</b> There were no significant differences in fibrin turnover between the treatment groups.

40|$|Purpose: This {{randomized}} multicenter, open-label, trial compared efficacy, acceptability, tolerability {{and compliance}} of <b>NuvaRing</b> {{with a combined}} oral contraceptive (COC), containing 30 μg of ethinyl estradiol (EE) and 3 mg of drospirenone. Method: In this 13 -cycle study, 983 women were randomized and treated (intent-to-treat population) with <b>NuvaRing</b> or COC. Results: One in-treatment pregnancy occurred with <b>NuvaRing</b> (Pearl Index= 0. 25) (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 006, 1. 363) and four with the COC (Pearl Index= 0. 99) (95 % CI: 0. 269, 2. 530). For both groups, compliance (89. 2 % <b>NuvaRing,</b> 85. 5 % COC) and satisfaction (84 % NuvaRing; 87 % COC) were high; {{the vast majority of}} women found <b>NuvaRing</b> easy to insert (96 %) and remove (97 %). Tolerability was similar; the most frequent adverse events with <b>NuvaRing</b> were related to ring use, whereas estrogen-related events were more common with the COC. Conclusion: <b>NuvaRing</b> has comparable efficacy and tolerability to a COC containing 30 μg of EE and 3 mg drospirenone. User acceptability of both methods was high. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.
