40|$|At {{the time}} of the Huygens probe descent in Titan's atmosphere, on 14 January 2005, many {{ground-based}} telescopes were pointed toward Saturn's satellite. Here, we describe the data collected on 15 and 16 January with <b>Nasmyth</b> <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Optics</b> <b>System</b> Near-Infrared Imager and Spectrograph (NACO) at the Very Large Telescope. We acquired adaptive optics images in the near-infrared in several NACO modes, 18 then 41 hours after Huygens landing. A variety of different filters, a cryogenic tunable Fabry-Perot interferometer, and a simultaneous differential imager were used. All these data allowed us to construct a diagnostic of the appearance of Titan's atmosphere and surface at {{the time of}} the Huygens probe's descent. We describe the north-south and east-west asymmetries characterizing the atmosphere, while reporting on more active phenomena, like cloud activity. The surface of Titan around the Huygens probe's landing site is imaged with a 320 -km spatial resolution, through three methane windows at 1. 28, 1. 6, and 2. 0 μm; it shows features similar to those previously published in near-infrared maps, with a spectral behavior compatible with methane and water ices...|$|R
40|$|Several {{ground-based}} telescopes {{followed the}} event of the Huygens probe descent through Titan's atmosphere (14 January 2005). We used the <b>Nasmyth</b> <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Optics</b> <b>System</b> Near-Infrared Imager and Spectrograph (NACO) adaptive optics system at the UT- 4 of the Very Large Telescope in Chile to perform both spectroscopic and imaging measurements of Titan. We present here a selected sample of the spectra we acquired on 16 January 2005 in the K band between 2. 03 and 2. 40 μm. Our spectra include the Huygens landing site and surrounding dark and bright areas. We apply a radiative transfer code using new methane absorption coefficients calculated in the 2 -μm region. The {{analysis of the data}} yields information on the atmosphere and surface properties of these areas. The latter seem to indicate a strong decrease of Titan's surface albedo between 2. 03 and 2. 12 μm in all areas. This is compatible with the presence of ices such as CH 4 and H 2 O at the surface. Sensitivity tests on the influence of the haze profile and the methane absorption on these results were performed...|$|R

40|$|Described here is {{the design}} and {{commissioning}} of a coronagraph facility for the 4. 2 -m William Herschel Telescope (WHT) and its <b>Nasmyth</b> <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Optics</b> for Multi-purpose Instrumentation (NAOMI). The use of the NAOMI system gives an improved image resolution of 0. 15 arcsec at a wavelength of 2. 2 μm. This enables the Optimised Stellar Coronagraph for Adaptive optics (OSCA) to suppress stellar light using smaller occulting masks and thus allows regions closer to bright astronomical objects to be imaged. OSCA provides a selection of 10 different occulting masks with sizes of 0. 25 – 2. 0 arcsec in diameter, including two with full grey-scale Gaussian profiles. There is also a choice of different sized and shaped Lyot stops (pupil plane masks).

40|$|Direct imaging of {{exoplanet}} systems {{requires the}} use of coronagraphs to reach high contrast levels (10 ^- 8 to 10 ^- 11) at small angular separations (0. 1 "). However, the performance of these devices is drastically limited by aberrations (in phase or in amplitude, introduced either by atmosphere or by the optics). Coronagraphs must therefore be combined with extreme <b>adaptive</b> <b>optic</b> <b>systems,</b> composed of a focal plane wavefront sensor and of a high order deformable mirror. These <b>adaptive</b> <b>optic</b> <b>systems</b> must reach a residual error in the corrected wavefront of less than 0. 1 nm (RMS) with a rate of 1 kHz. In addition, the surface defects of the deformable mirror, inherent from the fabrication process, must be limited {{in order to avoid the}} introduction of amplitude aberrations. An experimental high contrast bench has been developed at the Paris Observatory (LESIA). This bench includes a Boston Micromachine deformable mirror composed of 1024 actuators. For a precise analysis of its surface and performance, we characterized this mirror on the interferometric bench developed since 2004 at the Marseille Observatory (LAM). In this paper, we present this interferometric bench as well as the results of the analysis. This will include a precise surface characterization and a description of the behavior of the actuators, on a 10 by 10 actuator range (behavior of a single actuator, study of the cross-talk between neighbor actuators, influence of a stuck actuator) and on full mirror scale (general surface shape).
