40|$|Abalone is a {{herbivore}} {{marine animal}} which feeds on seaweed. Abalone culture has a good prospect {{in terms of}} price, market share and simple culture technique. Thus, a {{study was conducted with}} the aim of finding out an effective and efficient abalone culture technique in terms of feed use and density. In this study, a 42 cm diameter plastic container with a 22 cm height was used. Three vertically arranged containers were used as the experimental group which were put into a <b>net</b> <b>box</b> and hung onto a raft so that the containers were placed in a 4 m depth below the sea surface. The juvenile of abalones being used came from a hatchery production that has been adapted to cages environment with Gracilaria sp. and Ulva sp. feed. The initial density of abalones was 450 for each container, with the initial weight of 2. 6 - 3. 2 g and the  2. 5 - 2. 7 cm shell lengths. The abalones were fed with Gracilaria sp. and Ulva sp.  seaweeds with different Gracilaria sp. /Ulva sp. proportions, i. e. 100 / 0 % (A); 80 / 20 % (B); and 60 / 40 % (C) as the treatments. Each treatment consisted of two replications.  After three months of rearing period, densities of abalones were reduced to be 190  for each experimental unit. Weight and shell length of abalones were measured every month by measuring 25 abalone samples from each experimental unit. The result of the experiment showed that the increase in the Ulva sp. proportion in the feed increased the growth of abalones and decreased the feed conversion. Feeding with Gracilaria sp. /Ulva sp. proportion of 60 %/ 40 % allowed the best growth of abalones.  The decrease of abalone density in the experimental unit after three months of rearing also produced an increase in their growth...|$|E

The paper presents a detailed investigation of the solvability of recursive equations on nets in what is arguably the most general setting. For it allows an infinite number of possibly unguarded equations, each equation possibly involving infinitely many recursion variables. The main result is that by using a suitable partially ordered domain of nets, it is always possible to solve a system of equations by constructing the limit of a chain of successive approximations.

Each vertex which we call an agent belongs to a class which consists of a name, a principal port and auxiliary ports. A net is constructed by connecting the ports of the agents in twos using links. The principle of interaction requires that two agents and only two interact when they are linked by their principal ports. Such a c...|$|R

The experimental treatments are the control, 1, 2 and 3 % (w/v) Moringa oleifera Marinade (MOM), 5 % brine and 0. 2 % Butylated Hydroxyl Anisole (BHA) (w/v) solutions. Ninety fishes of average weight of 230 ± 8 g were gutted, washed and randomly assigned to the treatments. Thereafter, the fishes were soaked in the treatments for 2 hours and later hot smoked for 12 hours. After smoking, the fishes were stored in air-free <b>netted</b> <b>boxes</b> and placed on laboratory shelves at room temperature (37 ± 20 C) for 8 weeks. Samples were taken every seven days for chemical and sensory analysis. The proximate analysis showed that Moringa oleifera marinade (MOM) reduced the moisture content of smoke-dried fish samples throughout the storage period. The dehydrating property of MOM was concentration dependent with 3 % MOM samples having the lowest moisture content, which was significantly different from other treatments. There {{was no significant difference}} in the dehydrating properties of 1 % MOM, 2 % MOM and salt treated samples. All levels of MOM enhanced and maintained the protein, ash and fat content of smoke-dried fish samples.
