50|$|The Yeshwant Club in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India, {{came into}} {{existence}} in 1934 {{at the behest of}} late HH The Maharaja Sir Tukoji Rao III Holkar of Indore. The club was established out of <b>natural</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>affection</b> for his beloved son, Yuvraj Yeshwant Rao Holkar. Spread over an expanse of 14 acres, {{it is one of the}} living signatures of the rich Maratha legacy of the Holkar rulers of Indore State of the Maratha Confederacy. Initially the club was opened for Maratha royalty, nobility, aristocracy and the officers (Indians and British) of the Holkar State. Later its doors were opened for the business elites. After Indian independence, the admission criteria were revised according to the changing times..|$|E
5000|$|Storge (storgē, Greek: [...] ) is liking someone {{through the}} fondness of {{familiar}}ity, {{family members or}} people who relate in familiar ways that have otherwise found themselves bonded by chance. An example is the <b>natural</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>affection</b> of a parent for their child. It is described as the most natural, emotive, and widely diffused of loves: natural {{in that it is}} present without coercion; emotive because it is the result of fondness due to familiarity; and most widely diffused because it pays the least attention to those characteristics deemed [...] "valuable" [...] or worthy of love and, as a result, is able to transcend most discriminating factors. Lewis describes it as a dependency-based love which risks extinction if the needs cease to be met.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nature of}} being good {{has been given}} many treatments; {{one is that the}} good is based on the <b>natural</b> <b>love,</b> bonding, <b>and</b> <b>affection</b> that begins at the {{earliest}} stages of personal development; another is that goodness is a product of knowing truth. Differing views also exist as to why evil might arise. Many religious and philosophical traditions claim that evil behavior is an aberration that results from the imperfect human condition (e.g. [...] "The Fall of Man"). Sometimes, evil is attributed to the existence of free will and human agency. Some argue that evil itself is ultimately based in an ignorance of truth (i.e., human value, sanctity, divinity). A variety of Enlightenment thinkers have alleged the opposite, by suggesting that evil is learned as a consequence of tyrannical social structures.|$|R
40|$|While the {{doctrine}} of the presumption of advancement and its applicability {{have been the subject of}} much judicial and academic criticism, this article reviews judicial approaches from Australasia and Canada and argues that {{the doctrine}} is still relevant in contemporary times. While it is evident that Canadian courts are not willing to support the place of the presumption of advancement in relation to gratuitous gifts by parents to adult children, Australasian jurisprudence supports a more expansive view, which is consistent with the basis of the doctrine. The more expansive view is that the <b>natural</b> bond of <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>affection</b> flows from a parent to child, irrespective of the age of the child, and this does not change, regardless of social, political, or economic constraints or changes. Therefore, it is argued that the doctrine is still a useful tool in the judicial toolbox for resolving family disputes today. As a result, the author does not support the relegation of this doctrine to the annals of history, because to do so would be to ignore the realities of contemporary economic pressures...|$|R
60|$|Nor did I {{know the}} extent of my {{happiness}} quite, or the entire conversion of my dear noble enemy of the previous morning. It must have been galling to the pride of an elder man to have to yield to representations and objections couched in language so little dutiful as that I had used towards Mr. Lambert. But the true Christian gentleman, retiring from his talk with me, mortified and wounded by my asperity of remonstrance, {{as well as by}} the pain which he saw his beloved daughter suffer, went thoughtfully and sadly to his business, as he subsequently told me, and in the afternoon (as his custom not unfrequently was) into a church which was open for prayers. And it was here, on his knees, submitting his case in the quarter whither he frequently, though privately, came for guidance and comfort, that it seemed to him that his child was right in her persistent fidelity to me, and himself wrong in demanding her utter submission. Hence Jack's cause was won almost before he began to plead it; and the brave, gentle heart, which could bear no rancour, which bled at inflicting pain on those it loved, which even shrank from asserting authority or demanding submission, was only too glad to return to its <b>natural</b> pulses of <b>love</b> <b>and</b> <b>affection.</b>|$|R
