25|$|Sandusky faced {{a maximum}} {{sentence}} of 442 years in prison. According to NBC News, Sandusky likely faced a minimum sentence of 60 years – at his age, effectively a life sentence. Sentencing {{was scheduled for}} October 9, 2012. At that same hearing, prosecutors requested to the court that Sandusky be declared a sexually violent predator under Pennsylvania's version of Megan's Law, which would subject him to stringent reporting requirements if he is released. Sandusky would <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> report his address to police every three months {{for the rest of}} his life, but would also have to participate in a court-approved counseling program. However, this designation will likely be symbolic since Sandusky will almost certainly die in prison. Earlier, on August 30, the Pennsylvania Sexual Offenders Assessment Board recommended that Sandusky be declared a sexually violent predator.|$|E
500|$|James {{was given}} a good {{education}} at the English Court, where he developed respect for English methods of governance and for Henry V. [...] The Scottish king demonstrated apparent willingness to support Henry in his joining the English campaign in France during 14201421. [...] James's cousin, Murdoch Stewart, Albany's son, a captive in England since 1402, was traded for Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland, in 1416. Eight more years passed before James was ransomed, by which time Murdoch had succeeded his father to the dukedom and the governorship of Scotland. James married Joan Beaufort, daughter of the Earl of Somerset in February 1424 shortly before his release in April when they journeyed to Scotland. This was not altogether a popular re-entry to Scottish affairs since James had fought on behalf of Henry V and at times against Scottish forces in France. Noble families would now <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay increased taxes to cover the £40,000 ransom repayments but {{would also have to}} provide hostages as security. [...] Despite this, James held qualities that were admired. The contemporary Scotichronicon by Walter Bower described James as excelling at sport and appreciative of literature and music. Unlike his father and grandfather, he did not take mistresses but had many children by his wife, Queen Joan. The King had a strong desire to impose law and order on his subjects, but applied it selectively at times.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} part of the epic poem Mahabharata, it is written that the sage Vyasa (...) asked Ganesha to {{transcribe}} the poem as he dictated it to him. Ganesha agreed, but only on the condition that Vyasa recite the poem uninterrupted, without pausing. The sage, in his turn, posed the condition that Ganesha would <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> write, but would have to understand everything that he heard before writing it down. In this way, Vyasa might recuperate a bit from his continuous talking by simply reciting a difficult verse which Ganesha could not understand. The dictation began, but in the rush of writing Ganesha's feather pen broke. He broke off a tusk and used it as a pen so that the transcription could proceed without interruption, permitting him to keep his word.|$|E
2500|$|Alternative {{certificate}} {{programs were}} introduced in many inner-city schools and rural areas. These programs award a person a teaching license even though he/she has not completed a traditional teaching degree. This program came into effect in the 1980s throughout most states {{in response to the}} dwindling number of people seeking to earn a secondary degree in education. This program has been very controversial. It is, [...] "booming despite little more than anecdotal evidence of their success. there are concerns about how they will perform as teachers, especially since {{they are more likely to}} end up in poor districts teaching students in challenging situations." [...] Alternative Certificate graduates tend to teach African-Americans and other ethnic minorities in inner-city schools and schools in impoverished small rural towns. Therefore, impoverished minorities <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> cope with having the smallest amount of resources for their educational facilities but also with having the least trained teachers in the nation.

Mrs. Nihill has given me some few sheets of the Nengone language, and also lent me her husband's MS. grammar.
