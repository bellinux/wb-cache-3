2500|$|As {{a result}} of {{investigations}} into the scandal, a Navy Ad Hoc Gratuities Board determined that Rickover had received gifts from General Dynamics over a 16-year period valued at $67,628, including jewelry, furniture, exotic knives and gifts that Rickover had in turn presented to U.S. politicians. Charges were investigated as well that gifts were provided by two other major <b>nuclear</b> <b>ship</b> contractors for the navy, General Electric and the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock. Secretary Lehman admonished Rickover for his impropriety via a non-punitive letter and stated that Rickover's [...] "fall from grace with these little trinkets should be viewed {{in the context of}} his enormous contributions to the Navy." [...] Rickover released a statement through his lawyer saying his [...] "conscience is clear" [...] with respect to the gifts. [...] "No gratuity or favor ever affected any decision I made." [...] Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin, a longtime supporter of Rickover, later publicly associated a debilitating stroke suffered by the admiral to his having been censured and [...] "dragged through the mud by the very institution to which he rendered his invaluable service." ...|$|E

50|$|Modern non-nuclear {{submarines}} {{are potentially}} stealthier than nuclear submarines; a <b>nuclear</b> <b>ship's</b> reactor must constantly pump coolant, generating some amount of detectable noise (see acoustic signature).

While nuclear-powered designs still dominate in submergence times and deep-ocean performance, small, high-tech non-nuclear attack submarines are highly effective in coastal operations and pose a significant threat to less-stealthy and less-maneuverable nuclear submarines.|$|R
