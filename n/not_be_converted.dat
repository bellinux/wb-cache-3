However, methylated cytosines will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> in this process, and primers are designed to overlap the CpG site of interest, which allows one to determine methylation status as methylated or unmethylated.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese Military yen was {{distributed}} {{in many regions}} throughout East Asia under Japanese occupation. Initially, these were issued as payment to soldiers. The intention was the payout of an indefinite amount of Japanese military yen which could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> into Japanese yen and therefore could not cause inflation in Japan. However, the destructive effects on local East Asian economies was not a major concern.|$|E

25|$|Further, {{by refusing}} to rule on the charges themselves, {{the court did not}} clarify the proper {{disposition}} of criminal charges pending against a person whose competency can not be restored. This means that in those states where the charges are not dismissed, the individual may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> to a civil status eligible for civil commitment, resulting in such an individuals continued confinement in a secure prison with little opportunity for treatment and fewer privileges.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s and 1950s, {{as in many}} North American cities, {{public transit}} in San Francisco was {{consolidated}} {{under the aegis of}} a single municipal corporation, which then began phasing out much of the streetcar network in favor of buses. However, five heavily used streetcar lines traveled for at least part of their routes through tunnels or otherwise reserved right-of-way, and thus could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> to bus lines. As a result, these lines, running PCC streetcars, continued in operation.|$|E

25|$|When {{negotiations}} {{broke down}} over the specific boundary between Inner and Outer Tibet, the British chief negotiator Henry McMahon drew what {{has become known as}} the McMahon Line to delineate the Tibet-India border, amounting to the British annexation of 9,000 square kilometers of traditional Tibetan territory in southern Tibet, namely the Tawang district, which corresponds to the northwest extremity of the modern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, while recognizing Chinese suzerainty over Tibet and affirming the latter's status as part of Chinese territory, with a promise from the Government of China that Tibet would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> into a Chinese province.|$|E
25|$|One urban {{system that}} was not {{severely}} affected by the streetcar decline was the San Francisco Municipal Railway (MUNI) in San Francisco. Its five heavily used streetcar lines traveled for {{at least part of}} their routes through tunnels or otherwise reserved right-of-way, and thus could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> to bus lines. As a result, these lines, running PCC streetcars, continued in operation for several decades. When plans for stations in the double-decker Market Street Subway tunnel through downtown San Francisco, with BART on the lower level and MUNI on the upper level, required high platforms, it meant that the PCCs could not be used in them. Hence, MUNI ordered a fleet of new light rail vehicles, and Muni Metro began service in 1980.|$|E
25|$|Fatty acids {{are broken}} down to acetyl-CoA {{by means of}} beta {{oxidation}} inside the mitochondria, whereas fatty acids are synthesized from acetyl-CoA outside the mitochondria, in the cytosol. The two pathways are distinct, not only in where they occur, {{but also in the}} reactions that occur, and the substrates that are used. The two pathways are mutually inhibitory, preventing the acetyl-CoA produced by beta-oxidation from entering the synthetic pathway via the acetyl-CoA carboxylase reaction. It can also <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> to pyruvate as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex reaction is irreversible. Instead the acetyl-CoA produced by the beta-oxidation of fatty acids condenses with oxaloacetate, to enter the citric acid cycle. During each turn of the cycle, two carbon atoms leave the cycle as CO2 in the decarboxylation reactions catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Thus each turn of the citric acid cycle oxidizes an acetyl-CoA unit while regenerating the oxaloacetate molecule with which the acetyl-CoA had originally combined to form citric acid. The decarboxylation reactions occur before malate is formed in the cycle. Only plants possess the enzymes to convert acetyl-CoA into oxaloacetate from which malate can be formed to ultimately be converted to glucose.|$|E

25|$|The {{condition}} of the canal continued to decline. Complaints were made about its state in 1874 and 1885, which resulted in surveys being undertaken, but little was done to remedy the situation. In 1893, the Thames and Severn company announced that the canal between Chalford and Inglesham would close two days later. Negotiations {{with a number of}} interested parties took place, and having given an assurance that it would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> into a railway to the Great Western Railway, an Act of Parliament was obtained in 1895, which formed a Trust with powers to raise £15,000. The Trust included representatives from the Sharpness New Docks & Gloucester & Birmingham Company, the Stroudwater Canal, the Staffs & Worcs Canal, the Severn Commissioners, Berkshire, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire County Councils and Stroud and Cirencester District Councils. At {{the same time as the}} Trust refurbished the canal, the upper Thames was upgraded by the Thames Conservancy. Although the canal was re-opened in March 1899, lack of water on the summit level soon closed it again, after which Gloucestershire County Council suggested that they take it over. They did so on 2 July 1901. In 1925 they began negotiations with interested parties which ultimately led to the abandonment of the canal from Chalford to Inglesham in 1927. The Stroudwater Navigation managed to keep the remaining section open until 1933, when it was abandoned, and their own canal closed in 1941.|$|E
500|$|According to Fuller and Form, Warner Bros. {{suggested}} A Nightmare on Elm Street {{be released}} in 3-D, with the recent surge in 3-D films showing increased box office revenue. In {{the opinion of the}} Platinum Dunes producers, if a film is not initially conceived as 3-D then it should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> to 3-D. In other words, given that the original Nightmare on Elm Street was not a 3-D film, Fuller and Form fought with the studio to keep the remake from being converted to 3-D. The producers note {{that at the end of}} the day, Warner Bros. and Platinum Dunes came to the agreement that presenting the film in 3-D would not be presenting [...] "the best version of the movie".|$|E
500|$|The Ukraine-based lead {{developer}} 4A Games {{made the}} game with a team of more than 80 people. A sequel to Metro 2033 written by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky, Last Light, is not related to his next book Metro 2034. Instead, it serves as a direct sequel to the first game, with the majority of the ideas created by 4A Games. According to Huw Beynon, head of communications for of THQ, the team chose not to make a video game adaption of 2034 as they thought 2034s tone was drastically different from its predecessor. He described it as an [...] "art-house thriller", and believed that, unlike the first game, it could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> successfully into a video game. However, Glukhovsky offered creative input to the project and wrote a brief outline of the game's story, as well as the game's dialogue, which used 3,000 spreadsheet cells in Excel. The team chose the bad ending of 2033, as they believed that it offered an interesting beginning for Last Light, and is consistent with the novel's dark and depressing tone. Glukhovsky claimed that the story would explore the theme of redemption, people repeating their mistakes, and {{the idea of having a}} [...] "second chance". The Artyom character also shifted to become more mature and experienced. However, he remained a silent character as the team thought that having him speak would not contribute to his character development and would interfere with the atmosphere and morality system.|$|E
