'Aid to the refugees is accounted for at the official rate of exchange for dollars', the American officers noted, adding that 'malpractices have been carried on (officially, the dollar is worth 10 schillings; on the black market, 100 to 150).

40|$|This {{survey of}} the Norwegian purse seine fleet {{licensed}} to fish blue whiting focuses {{on the relationship between}} restricted fisheries, such as spring-spawning herring, North Sea herring, mackerel, and capelin, and unrestricted fisheries, of which blue whiting is the most important. To model the behaviour of the fishermen a restricted profit function is used, where species quotas are treated as fixed factors while blue whiting along with other <b>non-quota</b> species are variable factors. We find no relationship between blue whiting and herring, and mackerel. Blue whiting and capelin are substitutes. So are other <b>non-quota</b> species and spring-spawning herring. Other <b>non-quota</b> species are complements to mackerel and North Sea herring. 1 Most fishing vessels target several stocks and species.

40|$|Research PaperThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to model and measure shadow prices for quota that are not only vessel-specific but also conditioned upon the fisher's own quota holdings and individual circumstances regarding fishing effort. Shadow prices reflect the scarcity value of quota to each particular fisher and can be used to determine the maximum amount that each fisher {{would be willing to pay}} in order to purchase a one unit increase in quota. The fishery of interest is the Canadian Scotia-Fundy mobile gear fishery. Individual transferable vessel quotas were introduced for the 1991 fishing season for the three main species: cod, haddock and pollock. Using individual vessel data a restricted normalized quadratic profit function is used in estimation. The quadratic form is used here because of the ease of imposing regularity conditions. The model is specified imposing no restrictions on economies of scale but using an instrumental variable technique to account for possible correlation of fixed output levels with the residuals prior to 1991. Vessels are assumed to minimise the cost of harvesting quota regulated species and maximise profits over unregulated landings. The shadow value is measured as the value to the vessel of an increase in quota holdings. This includes a change in <b>non-quota</b> restricted profit caused by an increase in marginal cost from a one unit increase in quota landings, and a change in restricted profit due to the substitute/complementary relationship between <b>non-quota</b> and quota landings. The shadow value to the vessel is the price of quota fish minus the change in restricted profit. Changing regulatory polices will impact the value that fishers place on quota and knowledge of this value will allow regulators to identify types of transactions that might take place. Because shadow values are conditioned upon other quota holdings, fishery managers can influence the value fishers place on quota by changes in other quota holdings...|$|E

Compararam-se as médias das notas de dois grupos de alunos em cada carreira, cotistas e não-cotistas, considerando o nível de prestígio social do curso e sua área do conhecimento do vestibular - Humanidades, Ciências e Saúde. Em linhas gerais, no conjunto das três turmas de cada área, os resultados mostraram que em aproximadamente dois terços ou mais das carreiras não houve diferenças expressivas entre as médias dos dois grupos ou estas foram favoráveis aos cotistas - apesar de exceção num único ano, nas Ciências. A principal tendência constatada, que encontrou eco em evidências empíricas de outras instituições, foi a da ausência de diferenças sistemáticas de rendimento a favor dos não-cotistas, contrariando previsões de críticos do sistema de cotas, no sentido de que este provocaria uma queda no padrão acadêmico da universidade.

40|$|On 1 January 2005, the {{international}} trade in textile and clothing was freed from the quota restrictions that had persisted {{for more than four}} decades. This study tests one of the predictions that countries effectively constrained by quotas in the major world markets will increase their exports at the expense of non-quota-constrained suppliers. The focus is on clothing imports of the two major markets, the US and EU- 15. These markets are separately analysed as they constitute different lists of quota-constrained countries, QCCs. Unlike others, this study uses a relatively longer data set of post-quota years, which allows us to understand the medium-term adjustment process of exporters following quota removal. We find a large amount of heterogeneity among the QCCs in their post-quota export performance. Only a few QCCs have benefited at the expense of not only the <b>non-quota</b> countries but also fellow QCCs. The estimates show that almost half of the QCCs were better off under the quota regime {{at least in terms of}} exports. The factors most likely to have influenced their heterogeneous performance are also examined...|$|E
40|$|On January 1, 2005, quotas on textile and {{clothing}} trade were lifted. With this, US and EU price-competitive clothing imports from China soared. Recent talk of quota safeguards notwithstanding, this has development implications for other, relatively uncompetitive, countries—especially those heavily reliant on textile {{and clothing}} exports. This study examines {{the effect that}} China {{will have on the}} Southeast Asian countries, as part of a bigger picture of economic competition and cooperation within Asia. The Southeast Asian countries are found to have a more competitive than complementary relationship with China in this sector. Using a constant elasticity of substitution model, this paper then finds a significant negative effect of quota-abolition on the Southeast Asian countries. However, a paradox is found. Though China should out-compete all the Southeast Asian countries based on supply-side competition, this is not reflected in actual growth patterns, where some Southeast Asian countries see robust growth in the US market, as well as the Japanese <b>non-quota</b> market. This could be due to ongoing expansion of the import markets, as well as other supply-side trends such as changes in comparative advantage. The outlook for the Southeast Asian countries is thus less bleak than most predict...|$|E
40|$|An Irish {{commercial}} fishery for orange roughy {{began in the}} Northeast Atlantic in 2001 {{with the assistance of}} government grants. The fishery began as an open access, <b>non-quota</b> fishery. The rapid boom and bust of many deep water fisheries was experienced. Landings peaked in 2002 and then dropped significantly the following year. Many vessels were forced out of the fishery due to high costs and rapidly declining stocks. By 2005 the fishery was largely closed. Applying a bioeconomic analysis, this paper shows why the fishery no longer exists and discusses both the external and opportunity costs of the fishery. A bioeconomic model is applied to the available data to assess the open access effort and harvest with and without government grant aid. The results suggest that in the absence of subsidies, deep water trawling would not have been viable. In addition to the financial costs such as high fuel consumption, there are also externalities associated with deep water trawling. Orange roughy is closely associated with deep water ecosystems such as seamounts and cold water corals. This paper examines the costs of damage to cold water corals.

40|$|Global {{landings}} of cephalopods (cuttlefish, squid and octopus) {{have increased}} {{dramatically over the}} past 50 years and now constitute almost 5 % of the total world’s fisheries production. At a time when landings of many traditional fin-fish stocks are continuing to experience a global decline {{as a result of}} over-exploitation, it is expected that fishing pressure on cephalopod stocks will continue to rise as the fishing industry switch their focus onto these <b>non-quota</b> species. However, long-term trends indicate that landings may have begun to plateau or even decrease. In European waters, cuttlefish are among the most important commercial cephalopod resource and are currently the highest yielding cephalopod group harvested inthe north-east Atlantic, with the English Channel supporting the main fishery for this species. Recruitment variability in this short-lived species drives large fluctuations in landings. In order to provide sustainable management for Sepia officinalis populations, it is essential that we first have a thorough understanding of the ecology and life historyof this species, in particular, the factors affecting spawning, early life stage (ELS) survival and recruitment variability. This review explores how and why such variability exists, starting with the impact of maternal effects (e. g. navigation, migration and egg laying), moving onto the direct impact of environmental variation on embryonic and ELSs and culminating on the impacts that these variations (maternal and environmental) have at a population level on annual recruitment success. Understanding these factors is critical to the effective management of expanding fisheries for this species...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop an effective biological sampling programme for fish species in the English Channel (ICES Divisions Vild and Vile) which are not subject to quota management, and to prepare these data for use in multispecies, multi-fleet models being developed by the Channel Fisheries Study Group. Length and age data were coIlected for six <b>non-quota</b> species, and length data for a further five species. The samples were coIlected over a period of two years from important ports on the French and UK coasts. The exploitation patterns of each species were described by allocating catches from similar catching gears, regions, seasons and target species into common units referred to as métiers. The most important métiers in terms of landed weight for each species were sampled, and a description of the seasonality and regionality of the fishery was prepared. The results and conclusions of the sampling for each species were presented by métier, and showed that the fisheries for aIl the species studied were to sorne extent seasonal and exploited regionally within VIld and VIle. The data were also assessed in terms of the suitability for use in fisheries models. The data coIlected were adequate for simple modelling studies for the more abundant species.

40|$|Commercial {{flatfish}} {{captured in}} demersal fisheries {{along the west}} coast of Ireland include quota species such as plaice (Pleuronectes platessa L), in addition to high value <b>non-quota</b> species, turbot (Psetta maxima L.) and brill (Scophthalmus rhombus L.). Important non-commercial angling species of interest include flounder (Platichthys flesus L.). However, knowledge of the population dynamics of these flatfishes along {{the west coast of}} Ireland is lacking, and considered to be inadequate for the establishment of any population trends. In light of this, habitats along the west coast of Ireland serving as nursery grounds for the juveniles of these species were investigated (2000 - 2009). Correctly distinguishing between pairs of recently settled flatfish species, which are morphologically similar in appearance, was a prerequisite to this research. Counts of the meristic characters, fin rays, which are species specific, proved to be a reliable identification tool for juveniles. Plaice were the most abundant flatfish species present on nursery grounds, followed by turbot, {{and to a lesser extent}} brill. Assessment of nursery grounds over the eight year period, revealed both inter-annual and spatial variability in the relative abundance, growth, and condition of plaice, turbot and brill. Certain trends were revealed in these parameters, indicating the existence of both high and low quality nursery habitats. Abundances of both plaice and turbot on nursery grounds were negatively correlated with sea water temperatures during the pelagic stage. Baseline data on the timing of critical events, including hatching, larval durations, and settlement, in addition to growth experienced during early life, were established from the otolith microstructure of turbot. Post-settlement growth rate estimates of turbot also indicated certain locations as high quality nurseries. The feeding ecology of juvenile turbot and brill on nursery grounds was described, with temporal and resource partitioning revealed, implying that competition is unlikely to arise between these two morphologically similar species. A high incidence of prey was observed in the gut content of all turbot and brill, suggesting that food was not limited on Irish nursery grounds. Turbot fed on a much wider range of prey in contrast to brill, which fed almost exclusively on one prey organism. This observation may be one reason for the general sparse distribution of brill. The improved understanding of the early life history of plaice, turbot and brill may aid in the development and implementation of effective management strategies in the future; at the very least for the protection of important nursery grounds, as any loss, or decline in the quantity or quality of these areas, will undoubtedly have a negative impact on the recruitment of these species...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of four self-contained papers. Paper 1 : The Push Towards UPE and the Determinants of the Demand for Education in Tanzania. This paper uses household data to investigate the determinants of demand for education in Tanzania and tests whether these have changed during the government’s push for Universal Primary Education in the 2000 s. We find that the abolition of school fees was followed by an overall increase in enrolment, yet the sustained importance of the household’s consumption, livelihood and education indicates that the socio-economic standing of the household remains {{an important source of}} educational inequality. We also include estimated returns to education as an explanatory factor but find no indications that returns determine demand in Tanzania. Paper 2 : Households' income-generating activities and marginal returns to labor in rural Tanzania. This study uses detailed household-level data to investigate income and activity diversification among households in rural Tanzania. Unlike previous research on diversification, it explicitly evaluates marginal returns within different activities, aiming to assess whether households are able to allocate labor so as to maximize their incomes, and what factors determine if they do so. The findings indicate that specialization in agriculture is not correlated with household welfare, and that agricultural wage work is a last resort option, as agricultural wage workers also allocate labor to their own farms {{to such an extent that}} marginal returns are lower than among others. Furthermore, wage rates are much higher than the agricultural shadow wages, implying that there are gains to be made from expanding the non-farm side of the rural economy. However, there is no evidence that households are stuck in agriculture due to being constrained from entering the existing labor market. While I do not find preferences for own crops being important for labor allocation to farming, work preferences seem to play a role. There is also some evidence that both credit and social networks are important determinants of a household's probability of being stuck in low-return agriculture. Paper 3 : The Effects of Gender Quotas in Latin American National Elections. This study investigates the effects of gender quotas in national elections on political participation, public policy, and corruption in Latin America. We are able to replicate the findings from previous research that women in politics do affect these outcomes, but only when we treat the number of women in parliament as exogenous. We argue, however, that the introduction of gender quotas caused an – in this context – exogenous increase in women’s representation, and while we find that quotas in Latin America increased the number of women in parliament, we find no substantial effects beyond mere representation. The mechanisms for these findings are scrutinized, and we find some indication that quota women are not completely marginalized in Latin American parliaments. Hence, increasing women’s representation by means of gender quotas may not result in the same outcomes as an increased representation in <b>non-quota</b> elections. Paper 4 : The gender gap in African political participation: Individual and contextual determinants. The aim of this paper is to analyze the factors underlying the gender gap in African electoral and inter-electoral political participation. Drawing on new data covering over 27, 000 respondents from 246 regions in 20 emerging African democracies, the empirical findings suggest that while there is a gender gap in both voting and inter-electoral participation, the latter is larger. Whereas several of the investigated individual and contextual characteristics are found to be important determinants of participation, they explain only a very modest share of the observed gender gaps. We do find, however, that gender gaps in education are negatively correlated with female inter-electoral participation and that gender gaps in employment are negatively related to female voting. Interestingly, and contrary to suggestions in previous research, there is no evidence that religiosity at the individual or community level increases the gender differences in political activity...|$|E
40|$|Scallops are {{currently}} the 3 rd most valuable species in UK fisheries, with a first sale value of over £ 60 million per annum. Scallops are a <b>non-quota</b> species and landings {{have more than}} doubled in the last eight years. Forty percent of king scallop (Pecten maximus) landings into the UK originate from the English Channel. Despite the economic importance of this fishery {{there has never been a}} full stock assessment of scallops in English waters and there is a general paucity of scientific data for stocks in the English Channel. Existing management measures are not aligned with the biological structure of the stock, or based on robust science. The aims of the study were to provide data to assess the sustainability of the king scallop fishery through identifying the maximum spatial extent and distribution of fishing effort in the English Channel and defining scallop population structure by the degree of larval connectivity between spatially segregated scallop beds. The environmental impacts of the dredge fishery were investigated through quantifying bycatch and the impact of the dredge fishery on the habitats and communities present across scallop fishing grounds. The activity and spatial extent of the inshore and offshore scallop fleets indicated that although scallop fishing has occurred across a large proportion of the English Channel, fishing behaviour is sporadic and is concentrated in areas that are characterised by consistent scallop abundance. Economic and legislative drivers have altered historical fishing patterns in recent years. The patchiness of fishing behaviour, coupled with the nomadic nature of the fleet suggest that closure of areas that are infrequently fished could provide ecosystem benefits and potential benefits for the wider fishery while having minimal impact on fleet behaviour. Despite the well documented environmental impacts of scallop dredges, it is important to understand the environmental context in which fishing occurs as well as the predicted recovery timescales for benthic communities. Within the context of the English Channel king scallop fishery, species diversity and benthic community composition are constrained primarily by natural physical disturbance. It was not possible to detect community level response to a gradient of scallop fishing intensity against a background of environmental forcing. This could be due to historical fishing activity (40 + years) that may have changed the community to a stable altered state that continues to reflect the background environmental gradient across the English Channel. Bycatch in the English Channel was low compared to other towed mobile fishing gears and compared to other scallop dredge fisheries in the UK. Bycatch composition varied over local and broad spatial scales. The fishery affected a limited number of bycatch species of ecological importance and low biomass of such species were present, indicating that the population impacts of the dredge fishery on these species are likely to be minimal. Discards of commercial species also varied significantly with location and were higher in the eastern English Channel. Three reproductively distinct populations of scallops have been identified in the English Channel, indicating the largest appropriate management units. Large scale oceanographic currents maintain larval connectivity across much of the English side of the Channel; however complex hydrodynamic processes within Falmouth Bay suggest that larval dispersal is prevented at localised spatial scales in this location. The population in the Baie de Seine is reproductively isolated from the eastern English Channel, however larvae may disperse west, to the Baie St Brieuc and southern Cornwall, via residual currents. Improving the management, sustainability and public perception of the English Channel king scallop dredge fishery is a priority for the UK scallop industry. This thesis addresses fundamental gaps in the scientific data to inform future management and the sustainable exploitation of the fishery...|$|E
40|$|The landing {{obligation}} {{is a key}} element of the reform to the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) which came into force on 1 st January 2014. Other key changes include regionalised fisheries management and a legal commitment to fish sustainably. A ban on discarding comes into force for pelagic fisheries first, on 1 st January 2015. Subsequently, it will cover demersal fisheries between 2016 and 2019. It only applies to fish stocks which are managed by catch limits, or quotas. <b>Non-quota</b> stocks are not covered by the discard ban. The {{landing obligation}}, {{often referred to as the}} discard ban, is a ban on discarding fish which are subject to catch limits, so that all catches must be brought ashore, except where they are subject to specific exemptions. This means that quotas now control what is caught at sea, rather than what is landed onshore. Article 14 of the new CFP basic regulation stipulates that “Member States may produce a “discard atlas” showing the level of discards in each of the fisheries covered by the landing obligation”. For the North Sea, the ‘Scheveningen Group’ developed a discard atlas to document the current knowledge of how much discards are generated in the North Sea and to assemble information on strategies to mitigate discards. This latest report presents an analogous document, following the format of the North Sea work, to produce a discards atlas for the North Western Waters (NWW) region – specifically, for demersal fisheries. The principle of the landing obligation is to provide a limit on total catch, whereby all catches of regulated species are landed, and once any of the quotas in a fishery are reached, fishing activities cease on species whose quotas are exhausted. It is anticipated this will motivate changes in fishing behaviour and practices. To maximize revenue from their catch, fishermen will attempt to avoid catching fish that will result in a curtailment of the fishing season (sometimes referred to as ‘choke species’) and avoid catching undersized, and low-value fish, which would be deducted from their quota for little or no profit. The level of incentive, and the potential impact for vessel operators, will be dependent on their catch and discard patterns and the quota availability. The purpose of this discard atlas is to provide evidence of discard patterns for different fishing fleets in the North Western Waters region. This information may be used to assist regional managers with the identification of fisheries which may need more focussed attention in the transition to the landing obligation, and in the formulation of a Discard Plan and Multi-Annual Plans (MAPs). There is substantial detail presented in this atlas. The NWW Atlas is intended to be interrogated by regional managers to enable comparisons between fishing vessel groups (fleet segments), fisheries and species, and in turn facilitate priority setting. It is not the intention of the atlas to articulate different management options; hence there is limited analysis and discussion of the content. With this purpose in mind, it is important to understand the quality of the data. The NWW Atlas is derived from the best available data. The results presented are based on the official STECF database which holds information on landings and discards between 2003 and 2012. The information on effort,landings and discards in EU fisheries are derived from two sources - effort and landings from the national fisheries statistics, and discards data collected under the EU Data Collection Framework (DCF, EEC, 2000). Discard data are sampled and recorded for less than 2 % of all fishing operations, and these data are extrapolated to the fleet level. Where no data exist for a fishery, fill-ins are used from data from related fisheries, as is standard practice. If an estimate is largely derived from such filled-in data it may be less accurate. As with the North Sea atlas, the data quality of discard estimates was assessed by calculating the proportion of the discard estimate derived from actual observations relative to the overall amount of discards. However, this does not account for the level of initial extrapolation from the samples to the fleet, which can mean estimates are based on low samples. Known uncertainties in the data are described in the text that support the tables. The STECF database was used to compile landings and discards data for some of the most-commonly caught species in the North Western Waters (STECF 2013 a) using data from 2010 to 2012. The data presented are from the west of Scotland (VIa), Irish Sea (VIIa) and the Celtic Sea (ICES Divisions VII b-c and e-k). The data for the Eastern Channel (VIId) was compiled for the Discard Atlas of North Sea Fisheries and can be found in Annex 8. Discard ratios were used to express the percentage proportion of the catch that consisted of discards. Data are presented in the same format as that in the ‘Discard Atlas of North Sea Fisheries’ - estimated totals of landings and discards (in tonnes) by year and species, country and fisheries. The analysis of the pelagic fisheries was conducted prior to, and separately from, the demersal fisheries. The ‘Discard Atlas of the North Western Waters Pelagic and Industrial Fisheries’ can be found here. Included within the NWW Discard Atlas is a review of some of the legislation introduced and research conducted to mitigate discards. To improve mitigation strategies, it is important to know the reasons for discarding. Unfortunately, precise reasons are often unknown, because they are not recorded by fishers, and also because a mix of market- and regulatory conditions may influence decisions to discard. Inferences on the drivers for discarding can be made based on the length of the fish and the presence of different regulations. This is further elaborated upon in the ‘Discard Atlas of North Sea Fisheries’ which can be found here. The various reasons for discarding will necessitate different solutions. It should be understood that the methods most effective at mitigating discards of larger fish, driven by quota restrictions, will be different to discards that are undersized and are driven by the selective properties of fishing gears. Therefore, the data presented here should be used as a start point to identify fisheries which require more attention in the implementation of the CFP. More detailed analysis of the discard patterns in these fisheries is then required to determine appropriate mitigation and management strategies. It should also be noted that historical discard patterns (2010 - 12) indicate the potential issues under the future landing obligation, but pulses in recruitment or changing distributions of species may create different issues for fishing vessel operators than those that can be deduced from the historical data presented here...|$|E
