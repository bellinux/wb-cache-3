5|$|There {{was still}} at this time no common {{agreement}} {{on the way to}} present plant names so they ranged in length from one word to lengthy descriptive sentences. As the number of recorded plants increased this <b>naming</b> <b>system</b> became more unwieldy.|$|E
5|$|The {{human genome}} encodes 16serpin clades, termed serpinA through serpinP, {{including}} 29inhibitory and 7non-inhibitory serpin proteins. The human serpin <b>naming</b> <b>system</b> {{is based upon}} a phylogenetic analysis of approximately 500serpins from 2001, with proteins named serpinXY, where X is the clade of the protein and Y {{the number of the}} protein within that clade. The functions of human serpins have been determined by a combination of biochemical studies, human genetic disorders, and knockout mouse models.|$|E
5|$|Toyota's {{pattern of}} {{updating}} their Lexcen model tended to follow Commodore's model cycle. The T2 (VP) Lexcen from 1991 pioneered new specification designations: CSi, VXi and Newport.

5|$|Alcatraz cellhouse had a {{corridor}} <b>naming</b> <b>system</b> named after major American streets and landmarks. Michigan Avenue was {{the corridor to}} the side of A-Block, and Broadway was the central corridor in which the inmates would assemble as they massed through Times Square (an area with a clock on the wall), before entering the dining hall for their meals. Broadway separated Block-B and Block-C and prisoners kept along it had the least privacy in the prison. The corridor between Block-C and the library was called Park Avenue. The corridor in D-Block was named Sunset Strip. Gun galleries lay {{at the end of each}} block, including the West and East Gun Galleries.|$|E
5|$|In {{one of the}} interludes of The Loves of the Plants, {{the voice}} of the Poet, which would seem to be Darwin's voice as well, argues that poetry is meant to appeal to the senses, {{particularly}} vision. Darwin's primary tool for accomplishing this was personification. Darwin's personifications were often based on the classical allusions embedded with Linnaeus's own <b>naming</b> <b>system.</b> However, they were not meant to conjure up images of gods or heroes; rather, the anthropomorphized images of the plants depict more ordinary images. They also stimulate the readers' imaginations to assist them in learning the material and allow Darwin to argue that the plants he is discussing are animate, living things—just like humans. Darwin's use of personification suggests that plants are more akin to humans than the reader might at first assume; his emphasis on the continuities between mankind and plantkind contributes to the evolutionary theme that runs throughout the poem.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Atlantic {{tropical}} cyclones were named via the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet. Hurricane Fox of 1952 {{was the final}} Atlantic tropical cyclone to be designated with this <b>naming</b> <b>system,</b> and a female list of tropical cyclone names was utilized in the 1953 Atlantic hurricane season. After the stronger 1917 Pinar del Río hurricane, Hurricane Fox was Cuba's second most intense landfall until Hurricane Michelle struck the island in 2001. Originally, the 1917 hurricane was {{believed to have been}} a Category3 hurricane prior to the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis, which made Fox the second Category4 landfall after the 1932 Cuba Hurricane. At the time, Fox was the fourth most intense hurricane to strike Cuba in terms of atmospheric pressure; only the 1917, 1924, and 1932 storms were stronger at one point in their life spans.|$|E

5|$|Pumping {{stations}} {{maintain the}} momentum of the oil as it goes through the pipeline. Pump Station 1 is the northernmost of 11 pump stations spread across the length of the pipeline. The original design called for 12 pump stations with 4 pumps each, but Pump Station 11 was never built. Nevertheless, the pump stations retained their intended <b>naming</b> <b>system.</b> Eight stations were operating at startup, and this number increased to 11 by 1980 as throughput rose. As of December 2006, only five stations were operating, with Pump Station 5 held in reserve. Pump Stations 2 and 7 have a capacity of moving 60,000 gallons/minute (227,125 l/min), while all other stations have a capacity of 20,000 gal/min (75,708 l/min). The pumps are natural-gas or liquid-fueled turbines.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} an {{international}} standard for chemistry was first addressed in 1860 by a committee headed by German scientist Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz. This committee was the first international conference to create an international <b>naming</b> <b>system</b> for organic compounds. The ideas that were formulated in that conference evolved into the official IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry. IUPAC stands as a legacy of this meeting, {{making it one of}} the most important historical international collaborations of chemistry societies. Since this time, IUPAC has been the official organization held with the responsibility of updating and maintaining official organic nomenclature. IUPAC as such was established in 1919. One notable country excluded from this early IUPAC is Germany. Germany's exclusion was a result of prejudice towards Germans by the Allied powers after World War I. Germany was finally admitted into IUPAC during 1929. However, Nazi Germany was removed from IUPAC during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most breeds, {{there is}} a set <b>naming</b> <b>system</b> {{that is used to}} {{identify}} individuals based on the registration format employed by the Canadian Livestock Records Corporation. First comes the prefix, the farm or breeding establishment of which the foal was born into, followed by the sire's name, and lastly the given name for the foal. Each year a different letter is assigned to begin the given name for the foal, and it is by the year's letter that the foal is named. Some older horses do not fall under this naming strategy, but it is now mandatory in naming registered offspring coming from purebred Canadian lines. Originally, horses were tattooed with identification numbers, but now microchipping is the identification technology chosen by the breed registry.|$|E

40|$|<b>Name</b> <b>systems</b> provide easy {{communication}} in large networks and relieve the network users and administrators from remembering long network addresses. But mobility, limited lifetime of user nodes and dynamic situations of MANETs {{make it impossible}} to use conventional <b>NAME</b> <b>systems</b> such as DNS on these kinds of networks. Numerous <b>name</b> <b>systems</b> are designed and proposed for MANETs, but most of these system are insecure and do not provide secure name services for upper layers. Name resolution {{is one of the main}} operations of that are conduct by client nodes to achieve the requested bindings from <b>name</b> <b>systems.</b> Vulnerability of MANETs to various security attacks, make it clear the need for a secure and reliable name resolution to protect the users against different security threats. In this paper, we present a solution to provide users with secure binding information that can use for secure name resolution. This solution is not dependent on any <b>name</b> <b>systems</b> and can be used with any previously designed naming scheme to enhance the security of name resolution even in offline state and link failures...|$|R
5|$|Persona was {{the first}} {{role-playing}} entry in the Megami Tensei series {{to be released in}} the west, with the first Megami Tensei release being action game Jack Bros. in 1995. While the main Megami Tensei series' use of Christian imagery made it unsuitable for localization at the time, Persona employed a different <b>naming</b> <b>system</b> to make it more acceptable. Persona was localized by Atlus' then-new North American branch Atlus USA. Persona was chosen as a series that could help define the company and compete with the likes of Final Fantasy, Suikoden and Breath of Fire. The team that localized Persona was quite small, which made the process quite difficult: not only was there a large amount of text to translate, but the team needed to adjust or change the Japanese references as they feared it might alienate western players. Among the changes were altering the player character's hairstyle, the ethnic origins of multiple characters, the character and location names, and multiple pieces of dialogue. The entire Snow Queen route was also cut from the game, leaving only the SEBEC story route open for exploration.|$|E
