50|$|The first {{generation}} of THC analogs (synhexyl, nabilone, nabitan, <b>nantradol)</b> featured slight variations of the THC molecule, such as esterifying the phenolic hydroxy group, extending and branching of the pentyl side chain, or substituting nitrogen for oxygen in the benzopyran ring. These analogs can be grouped into classical (HU-210), bicyclic (CP-55,940), and tricyclic (CP-55,244). Tritium-labelled cannabinoids such as ³HCP-55,940 were instrumental in discovering the cannabinoid receptors in the early 1990s.|$|E
50|$|Dane salt {{formation}} between 3,5-dimethoxyaniline and ethyl acetoacetate followed by borohydrate reduction gives synthon 1. The amino group {{is protected by}} rxn with ethyl chloroformate, the ester group is saponified, and then cyclodehydration with polyphosphoric acid leads to the dihydroquinoline ring system (2). Deblocking with HBr is followed by etherification of the nonchelated phenolic hydroxyl gives 3. Treatment with NaH and ethyl formate results in both N-formylation and C-formylation of the active methylene to give 4. Michael addition of methyl vinyl ketone (MVP) followed by successive base treatments to remove the activating C-formyl group and then to complete the Robinson annulation to give 5. Lithium in liquid ammonia reduces the olefinic linkage and successive acetylation and sodium borohydrate reductions complete the synthesis of <b>nantradol</b> (6).|$|E
40|$|Studies with [3 H]nantradol {{hydrochloride}} {{indicate that}} nantra-dol is extensively metabolized after oral administration. By using a liquid chromatography assay with electrochemical de-tection, specific for both <b>nantradol</b> and desacetylnantradol, only desacetylnantradol is detected in plasma of rats and dogs dosed with <b>nantradol.</b> In animal analgetic tests, desacetylnan-tradol exhibits activity at least equal to <b>nantradol.</b> Together, these findings and additional in vitro enzymatic {{studies suggest that}} desacetylnantradol is the analgetically active species in vivo. In rats and dogs, desacetylnantradol has an apparent half-life of about 2 hr. No evidence for drug accumulation or alteration of drug metabolizing enzymes is noted from desa-cetylnantradol plasma level determinations during 90 days of oral and 1 4 days of i. m. dosing in dogs or rats at doses of 0. 125 to 0. 5 mg/kg i. m. and 2. 5 to 10 mg/kg p. o.

40|$|Abstract: In rhesus monkeys, acute {{administration}} of levonantradol and <b>nantradol</b> produced signs of CNS depression, including ataxia with body sag, pupil dilation, ptosis, dozing, and reduced responsivity to external stimuli. Neither compound sup-pressed the morphine withdrawal syndrome; however, both alleviated the chronic abdominal contraction associated with withdrawal. The directly observable {{effects of these}} compounds were not antagonized by naloxone. When levonantradol was admin-istered every 6 hours, marked tolerance developed to both the effects of levonantradol and nabilone and THC. No signs of withdrawal were observed when levonantradol injections were abruptly discontinued. When substituted in lieu of codeine under an intravenous drug self-administration procedure, neither levonantradol nor <b>nantradol</b> maintained responding at rates higher than those maintained by their vehicle. Finally, the discriminative effects of levonantradol were not equivalent {{to those of the}} narcot-ics ethylketazocine or etorphine. C ANNABINOIDS have potential therapeu-tic applications in the treatment of glaucoma, asthma, nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, and pain. ’ Widespread recreational use of mari-huana, however, raises questions about whether the potential for abuse of novel cannabinoids may limit their usefulness as therapeutic agents. At present, there are no generally accepted protocols for the preclin-ical evaluation of the abuse liability of can-nabinoids. In the absence of such protocols, {{and in the absence of}} standards of refer-ence, the present study evaluated two can-nabinoids in the rhesus monkey under procedures useful in evaluating abuse lia-bility of narcotic analgesics. The comparison of narcotics and canna-binoids is of interest, since there are some similarities in their various actions. For in-stance, a number of studies 2 suggest that 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has some analgetic effects in rodents under a variet...|$|E
