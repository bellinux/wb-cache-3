Both urban migration and unemployment have long been documented {{to be associated with}} vulnerability to mental problems. This study aims to examine the mental health of unemployed <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> in Eastern China and its relation to duration of unemployment and coping strategy during the recent economic crisis. Methods The data were collected through interview-based survey with a sample of 210 unemployed <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> in Zhejiang Province of China from 2008 to 2009. Symptom Checklist- 90 -Revised, Coping Strategies Questionnaire, and seven short demographic questions were used. Results The majority of the unemployed <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> were found to be young male manufacturing industry workers with short-term unemployment and a relatively low education level. Nearly 50 % of unemployed <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> were classified as mentally unhealthy and the most frequently reported symptom was depression. Compared with the adult norm of 1986, 2003, and 2007 in China, unemployed migrants had more mental problems. Long-term unemployed <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> had more psychiatric symptoms than the short-term unemployed <b>workers</b> and employed <b>migrant</b> <b>workers.</b> Unemployed <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> with immature coping strategies expressed significantly more psychiatric symptoms than those with mixed and mature coping strategies.

A total of 582 <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> were recruited from 17 factories scattered in 8 different industries. The mental health situations of the <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> were assessed using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). The migrant workers' migration stress and social competence were measured by the Migration Stress Scale and Social Competence Scale. The results suggest that <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> experienced four major clusters of psychiatric symptoms: interpersonal sensitivity, obsessive compulsion, depression, and hostility. Regression analysis revealed that migration stress and social competence significantly predicted the migrant workers' mental health. Migration stress alone explained 23 % of the variance. Specifically, "financial and employment difficulties" and lack of social life significantly predicted the mental health of the <b>migrant</b> <b>workers.</b> In the area of social competence, "social skills and language learning" and "personal characteristics" exerted significant effects on the mental health of <b>migrant</b> <b>workers.</b> In conclusion, social policies concerning <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> should aim at facilitating adjustments among <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> employed by factories in China. Prevention and treatment programs to improve the mental health of <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> in factories should also be implemented. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The unfairness of social mobility is included among the â€œpoor second generationâ€, â€œrich second generationâ€ and â€œofficer second generationâ€, which may lead to the hardening of social class and the appear of opposite classes; the new generation <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> are subverting their fathers’ psychological recognition of â€œman dominates the outside and the woman dominates the insideâ€ by the imbalanced sex structure, which is characterized by more women and less men. The social problems concerning new generation <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> caused by the sex discrepancy are directly related to the construction of the framework which comes up to the human moral and the stable improvement of the whole social ideological and cultural level. <b>Migrant</b> <b>workers,</b> New generation <b>migrant</b> <b>workers,</b> Social discrimination, Mobility of social class, Gender structure, China, Agribusiness,...|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{processes}} of the settlement of <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> in Korea and their acquisition of local citizenship. Since the early 1990 s, when <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> from neighboring Asian countries began to be officially admitted to Korea, the Korean government has upheld a temporary rotation policy for migrant labor. Concerned about potential socio-economic burdens that the settlement of unskilled <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> might bring to the society, the government has maintained a restrictive immigration policy while limiting the rights of <b>migrant</b> <b>workers.</b> Nevertheless, a large number of <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> have prolonged their stay and have become long-term settlers despite the lack of permanent residence and formal citizenship. Focusing on how they have challenged the nation’s policies on <b>migrant</b> <b>workers,</b> this study looked into the lives and experiences of long-term <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> in Korea.; Both policy analysis and ethnographic field research were employed in this study. The policy analysis, which was based on data from various sources, showed how the Korean government’s <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> policies have evolved over time and changed under which circumstances. Twenty month-long ethnographic field research in Kyǒnggi province, Korea, including participant observation in migrant communities and in-depth interviews with forty-three <b>migrant</b> <b>workers,</b> provided detailed explanations on how <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> survived crackdowns and the repatriation policy, brought in or formed families, and built communities while making claims for their rights to work and stay in Korea. Additional interviews with two government officials and six migrant human rights activists were also conducted.; The findings of this study revealed that the settlement of <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> has proceeded with the enhancement of their rights. With the support of migrant advocacy organizations, <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> have fought for their rights and demanded the Korean government improve its <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> policies. They have also appealed to the international organizations while taking advantage of the desire of the Korean government to be recognized as human rights country. As a result, they have achieved the reform of labor migration system, the amendment of the nationality law, the right to get public education for their children, and several amnesties although temporarily, all of which have facilitated their settlement. Furthermore, long-term <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> have become a part of their local communities by increasing their presence through the formation of grassroots organizations and the establishment of migrant communities. Their entitlement of various social rights, mainly provided by local migrant advocacy organizations in collaboration with local governments, has even granted them local citizenship that challenges the traditional notion of formal citizenship.; In conclusion, this study suggests that planners and policymakers in local governments should take a more active role in improving <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> policies in Korea than those in the national government who put control and regulation over social integration. By understanding the realities of <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> and hearing their voices, local governments should acknowledge the contributions of <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> to their localities’ cultural and economic vitality and embrace long-term <b>migrant</b> <b>workers</b> who have already settled in to be incorporated as members of the society...|$|R
