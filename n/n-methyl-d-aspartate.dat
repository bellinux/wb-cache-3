25|$|NMDA {{receptor}} antagonists are a {{class of}} anesthetics that work to antagonize, or inhibit the action of, the <b>N-Methyl-D-aspartate</b> receptor (NMDAR).

25|$|In 1949 L. Henderson {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} to describe quinolinic acid.

However, it was not until 1981 that Stone and Perkins showed that quinolinic acid activates the <b>N-methyl-d-aspartate</b> receptor (NMDAR). After this, Schwarcz demonstrated that elevated quinolinic acid levels could lead to axonal neurodegeneration.|$|E
25|$|A novel {{treatment}} {{approach has}} recently been developed {{as a result of}} translational research. It has been shown that a combination of acute dosing of d-cycloserine (DCS) with exposure therapy facilitates the effects of exposure therapy of social phobia. DCS is an old antibiotic medication used for treating tuberculosis and does not have any anxiolytic properties per se. However, it acts as an agonist at the glutamatergic <b>N-methyl-D-aspartate</b> (NMDA) receptor site, which is important for learning and memory.|$|E
25|$|The <b>N-methyl-D-aspartate</b> (NMDA) {{receptor}} {{seems to}} play a major role in neuropathic pain and in the development of opioid tolerance. Dextromethorphan is an NMDA antagonist at high doses. Experiments in both animals and humans have established that NMDA antagonists such as ketamine and dextromethorphan can alleviate neuropathic pain and reverse opioid tolerance. Unfortunately, only a few NMDA antagonists are clinically available and their use is limited by a very short half life (dextromethorphan), weak activity (memantine) or unacceptable side effects (ketamine).|$|E
25|$|In European starlings, neurons in NCM habituate to a {{particular}} stimulus, and “remember” individual characteristics of songs to which a bird was exposed. This indicates that NCM functions in individual recognition, through the strategic recruitment of <b>N-Methyl-D-aspartate</b> receptors (NMDAR) to synapses that receive repeated patterns of excitation. In fact, NMDARs {{are thought to be}} the unit broadly responsible for synaptic memory in the central nervous system. NMDARs in NCM neurons, therefore, might be a compelling target for selection when song functions in discrimination among conspecific songs, for neighbor recognition and territorial defense, but NCM is unlikely {{to play a role in}} the discrimination of conspecific from heterospecific songs.|$|E
25|$|There is {{compelling}} {{evidence that the}} <b>N-methyl-D-aspartate</b> (NMDA) receptor has significant involvement in the CNS sensitization process. It is also hypothesized that elevated CNS glutamate levels promote wind-up and CNS sensitization. In addition, there is experimental evidence that demonstrates NMDA receptors in peripheral nerves. Because immunological functions can modulate CNS physiology, {{it has also been}} hypothesized that a variety of immune processes may contribute to the initial development and maintenance of peripheral and central sensitization. Furthermore, trauma related cytokine release, exaggerated neurogenic inflammation, sympathetic afferent coupling, adrenoreceptor pathology, glial cell activation, cortical reorganisation, and oxidative damage (e.g., by free radicals) are all concepts that have been implicated in the pathophysiology of CRPS.|$|E
500|$|The {{hippocampus}} is {{a particularly}} favorable site for studying LTP because of its densely packed and sharply defined layers of neurons, but similar types of activity-dependent synaptic change have also been observed in many other brain areas. [...] The best-studied form of LTP has been seen in CA1 of the hippocampus and occurs at synapses that terminate on dendritic spines and use the neurotransmitter glutamate. [...] The synaptic changes depend on a special type of glutamate receptor, the <b>N-methyl-D-aspartate</b> (NMDA) receptor, a cell surface receptor which has the special property of allowing calcium to enter the postsynaptic spine only when presynaptic activation and postsynaptic depolarization occur at the same time. [...] Drugs that interfere with NMDA receptors block LTP and have major effects on some types of memory, especially spatial memory. Genetically modified mice that are modified to disable the LTP mechanism, also generally show severe memory deficits.|$|E

2500|$|Astrocytes detect {{neuronal}} {{activity and}} can release chemical transmitters, {{which in turn}} control synaptic activity. In the past, hyperalgesia {{was thought to be}} modulated by the release of substance P and excitatory amino acids (EAA), such as glutamate, from the presynaptic afferent nerve terminals in the spinal cord dorsal horn. Subsequent activation of AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid), NMDA (<b>N-methyl-D-aspartate)</b> and kainate subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors follows. It is the activation of these receptors that potentiates the pain signal up the spinal cord. This idea, although true, is an oversimplification of pain transduction. [...] A litany of other neurotransmitter and neuromodulators, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), galanin, and vasopressin are all synthesized and released in response to noxious stimuli. In addition to each of these regulatory factors, several other interactions between pain-transmitting neurons and other neurons in the dorsal horn have added impact on pain pathways.|$|E

50|$|The <b>N-methyl-D-aspartate</b> {{receptor}} (also {{known as}} the NMDA receptor or NMDAR), is a glutamate receptor and ion channel protein found in nerve cells.
