In this study, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid and curcumin were produced in Escherichia coli. Their production was induced by heat using the dnaK and ibpA heat shock promoters. The ribosome binding site (RBS) used was tested and further optimized for each gene to assure an efficient translation. p-Coumaric acid was successfully produced from tyrosine and caffeic acid was produced either from tyrosine or p-coumaric acid using tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) from Rhodotorula glutinis, 4 -coumarate 3 -hydroxylase (C 3 H) from Saccharothrix espanaensis or cytochrome P 450 CYP 199 A 2 from Rhodopseudomonas palustris. The highest p-coumaric acid production obtained was 2. 5  mM; caffeic acid production reached 370  M. Regarding curcumin, 17  M was produced using 4 -coumarate-CoA ligase (4 CL 1) from Arabidopsis thaliana, diketide-CoA synthase (DCS) and curcumin synthase 1 (CURS 1) from Curcuma longa. Stronger RBSs and/or different induction conditions should be further evaluated to optimize those production levels. Herein it was demonstrated that the biosynthetic pathway of p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid and curcumin in E. coli can be triggered by using heat shock promoters, suggesting its potential {{for the development of}} <b>new</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>bioprocesses</b> or even new bacterial therapies.

Thesis Abstract Amplytica is {{start-up}} company whose software, called the Amplytica Cloud Platform, helps organizations determine how microbes influence their bioprocesses. Examples of such bioprocesses include anaerobic digestion, wastewater treatment and mine site reclamation. The Amplytica Cloud Platform does this by integrating and analyzing metagenomically derived microbial community data (species composition, diversity, and abundance) and <b>industrial</b> <b>bioprocess</b> data (e. g. temperature, pH, nutrients). To achieve data integration, <b>industrial</b> <b>bioprocess</b> data is considered metadata to the microbial community information and describes the environmental conditions where the microbial community is found. The capture of this industrial metadata requires a robust metadata capture system. Kroak is a metadata capture {{system for the}} Amplytica Cloud Platform that facilitates tagging per-sample microbial community information with industrial environmental metadata. It uses a modern web interface for easy deployment, Office Open XML Workbook (XLSX) template files for easy metadata capture, and metadata classes to ensure data consistency and type identification for follow on automated statistics and machine learning. Kroak is a functional metadata capture system which will be iteratively improved upon by Amplytica. Potential improvements include changes to Kroak’s data model, increasing the reliability of its metadata parsing {{and the expansion of}} its existing web application programming interface...|$|R

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. The {{intrinsic}} environmental {{advantages of}} <b>industrial</b> scale <b>bioprocesses</b> over chemical processes remain a discussion point owing to limited objective analysis. Studies to date are often limited to energy or global warming considerations {{with little regard}} for full Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) analyses. This, in part, may be owing to the difficulty in obtaining the material and energy balance inventory required for such assessment at an early stage in process development. However, these studies are important in designing and selecting environmentally beneficial processes for the conversion of renewable resources to commodity and energy products. The overall objective of the thesis is to obtain the data required to perform these LCA analyses.

40|$|Bioactive {{peptides}} {{that can}} self-assemble reversibly, {{in response to}} external stimuli, are {{at the core of}} a new breed of “smart” peptides that form a complex array of novel biomaterials with potential applications in fields including tissue engineering, nanoelectronics, functional surface coating and food production. The majority of future markets associated with peptide-based biomaterials are characterized by high volume and low cost economics. This has limited the deployment of these new biomaterials because the expensive, synthetic peptide production routes currently used by industry to produce commercial quantities of peptide therapeutics are not compatible with this cost dynamic. Consequently, this project aimed to contribute to ongoing efforts to achieve cost-effective, efficient and scalable means of producing peptide by utilizing recombinant DNA technology and microbial hosts. Three separate bioprocesses have been designed, investigated and reported in this thesis. The first process design is based on the insoluble expression of a peptide-concatamer fusion protein in a bacterial host, and represents an attempt at optimizing a conventional, commercially-available system to test its suitability as an <b>industrial</b> <b>bioprocess.</b> The second bioprocess utilizes a soluble expression system, also in a bacterial host, and exemplifies a substantial departure from traditional process designs for recombinant peptide production. A final methodology is described which employs a yeast expression host and relies on the incorporation of additional unit operations into an existing <b>industrial</b> <b>bioprocess,</b> to create a dual production route for a target peptide and a target protein. The key research findings in this body of work are related to the development of selective precipitation methods, which were employed throughout each of the described processes to various degrees. Simple organic solvents, salts and acids were used to exploit the property differences between peptides and proteins in order to selectively partition peptide from heterogenous mixtures. The selective precipitation methods devised successfully minimized the need for expensive and time-consuming chromatography processes which are ordinarily required to obtain high yields of pure peptide. In terms of recombinant peptide production, the Selective Solvent Precipitation (SSP) techniques developed as part of this PhD have genuine potential as an industrial replacement for expensive chromatographic unit operations that currently limit the cost-effectiveness of conventional production routes...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} a {{modified}} mid-ranging strategy is proposed where the controller for the secondary manipulated variable uses its own output as its setpoint, possibly with an offset and/or re-scaling. This modification allows the manipulated variables {{to increase in}} unison so that the mid-ranging advantage of utilizing the fast dynamics of the primary controller to regulate the process can be achieved also in non-stationary processes, while not adding complexity to the controller. The proposed control strategy has been implemented in pilot-scale (5001) <b>industrial</b> <b>bioprocesses</b> where {{it is used to}} control the dissolved oxygen level by manipulating agitator speed and aeration rate. The controller is demonstrated to perform well in these, outperforming a reference controller which has previously been shown to give satisfactory control performance.
