40|$|When Eritrea {{achieved}} {{independence from}} Ethiopia in 1993 {{after a long}} war, the country's economy was in ruins, and public infrastructure and institutions were seriously damaged or destroyed. The new government faced a long process of establishing public-sector organizations to stimulate economic growth and provide basic services. Strengthening national agricultural research and development (R&D) and extension services was {{high on the list}} of priorities. In the first years after independence, the country's agricultural output, as well as its agricultural R&D expenditures, rose rapidly following an influx of support from foreign donors. Nevertheless, renewed conflict with Ethiopia in 1998 led to dramatic cuts in funding from both donors and the national government (Beintema, Okubay, and Debass 2003). In 2008, Eritrea invested 11. 7 million <b>nakfas</b> or 1. 9 million PPP dollars (in 2005 prices) in agricultural R&D, down from 90 million <b>nakfas</b> or 14 million PPP dollars a decade earlier, which represents a drop of 80 percent.

50|$|Between 18 November and 31 December 2015, the Bank of Eritrea began {{replacement}} of all <b>nakfa</b> banknotes. The banknote replacement initiative {{was designed to}} combat counterfeiting, the informal economy but primarily Sudanese human traffickers who had accepted payments in <b>nakfa</b> banknotes in exchange for transporting would-be migrants primarily to Europe. A consequence of this was substantial amounts of the country's currency existed in vast hoardings outside Eritrea. The plan to replace the country's currency was top secret and designed to prevent human traffickers bringing their funds {{back in time to}} exchange for the new banknotes. On the 1 January 2016 the old <b>nakfa</b> banknotes ceased being recognized as legal tender, rendering external stockpiles of currency worthless.|$|E

5000|$|In September 1974, Emperor Haile Selassie {{was overthrown}} by a {{military}} coup in Ethiopia. The military committee that took power in Ethiopia is better known by its Amharic name the Derg. After the military coup the Derg broke ties with the U.S. and realigned itself with the USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) and the USSR and its eastern bloc allies replaced America as patrons of Ethiopia's aggression against Eritrea. Between January and July 1977, the ELF and EPLF armies had liberated 95% of Eritrea capturing all but 4 towns. However, in 1978-79, Ethiopia mounted a series of five massive Soviet-backed offensives and reoccupied almost all of Eritrea's major towns and cities, except for <b>Nakfa.</b> The EPLF withdrew to a mountain base in northern Eritrea, around the town of <b>Nakfa.</b> In 1980 the EPLF had offered a proposal for referendum to end the war, however, Ethiopia, thinking it had a military upper hand, rejected the offer and war continued. In February-June 1982, The EPLF managed to repulse Ethiopia's much heralded four-month [...] "Red Star" [...] campaign (aka the 6th offensive by Eritreans) inflicting more than 31,000 Ethiopian casualties. In 1984 the EPLF started its counter-offensive and cleared the Ethiopian from the North-eastern Sahil front. In March 1988 the EPLF demolished the Ethiopian front at Afabet in a major offensive the British Historian Basil Davidson compared to the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu.
