40|$|Abstract Background Animals, {{including}} humans, {{exhibit a}} variety of biological rhythms. This article describes a method for the detection and simultaneous comparison of multiple <b>nycthemeral</b> rhythms. Methods A statistical method for detecting periodic patterns in time-related data via harmonic regression is described. The method is particularly capable of detecting <b>nycthemeral</b> rhythms in medical data. Additionally a method for simultaneously comparing two or more periodic patterns is described, which derives from the analysis of variance (ANOVA). This method statistically confirms or rejects equality of periodic patterns. Mathematical descriptions of the detecting method and the comparing method are displayed. Results <b>Nycthemeral</b> rhythms of incidents of bodily harm in Middle Franconia are analyzed in order to demonstrate both methods.

40|$|Influence of <b>nycthemeral</b> blood {{pressure}} pattern in treated hypertensive patients on hemodialysis. Arterial hypertension in {{end-stage renal disease}} (ESRD) patients is characterized by an altered <b>nycthemeral</b> {{blood pressure}} (BP) rhythm and an increased pulse pressure, {{and it could be}} suggested that this association of risk factors {{plays a major role in}} the cardiovascular prognosis of this population. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of <b>nycthemeral</b> BP pattern on arterial distensibility and pulsatile components of BP in treated hypertensive patients on regular hemodialysis. Forty-two hypertensive patients were included, and all underwent ambulatory BP and pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurements between the femoral and carotid arteries. The patients were divided into two groups according to the magnitude of the nocturnal fall in BP: dippers and non-dippers. The groups were similar in gender, age, duration of hemodialysis, body mass index, body size, history of cardiovascular complications, class and number of antihypertensive drugs used per patient. PWV was significantly higher in non-dippers. For the whole population, a stepwise regression analysis showed that PWV and erythropoietin therapy were independently related to the impaired <b>nycthemeral</b> BP pattern. In addition to its pressor effect, erythropoietin could have a deleterious influence on the ambulatory BP profile of treated hypertensive patients in ESRD. Arterial distensibility and <b>nycthemeral</b> BP impairment are linked, and these cardiovascular risk factors should be taken into account together for the management of hypertensive hemodialysis patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{exploitation}} of resources by closely related species with similar niches may be mediated by differences in activity patterns, which may vary in <b>nycthemeral</b> scale and seasonal scale. Piranhas Serrasalmus gibbus and Serrasalmus rhombeus are Neotropical predators that occur sympatrically in many environments of the Amazon basin. To evaluate the strategies adopted by these two species in a restricted environment (a reservoir), <b>nycthemeral</b> and seasonal samples were made, identifying {{the composition of the}} diet and their activity patterns. A total of 402 specimens were collected: 341 S. gibbus and 61 S. rhombeus. Both species fed themselves primarily on fish, with some seasonal variation being found in S. gibbus during the flood season, when plant material was consumed. There was considerable temporal overlap in the foraging behavior of the two species, although S. rhombeus presented a bimodal pattern of abundance over the 24 -hour cycle. S. rhombeus was more active during the nighttime, between dusk and early morning, whereas S. gibbus was active throughout the <b>nycthemeral</b> cycle. These findings indicate low levels of competition between the two species, which allowed for a considerable overlap in nighttime foraging, following distinct <b>nycthemeral</b> patterns of foraging activity and allowing their coexistence...|$|E
40|$|CORTICOTROPIC AXIS: The <b>nycthemeral</b> {{pattern of}} {{cortisol}} {{is a good}} marker of the circadian clock. Cortisol levels fluctuate between a peak level, observed {{in the early hours}} of the morning, and a minimal level around midnight. This variability is considerably reduced or even abolished in Cushing s syndrome. THYREOTROPIC AXIS: The <b>nycthemeral</b> pattern of TSH secretion is dependent on both the circadian clock and sleep (which inhibits hormone secretion). The moment of the evening rise is a reliable marker of the circadian rhythmicity. SOMATOTROPIC AXIS: Growth hormone is essentially pulsatile. GH levels are often undetectable between pulses. The circadian rhythmicity plays only a minor role in the regulation of growth hormone secretion. LACTOTROPIC AXIS: <b>Nycthemeral</b> variations in prolactin secretion are mainly regulated by wake-sleep cycles; peak levels occur in the middle of the night. Prolactin secretion is also modulated by the circadian rhythmicity. GONADOTROPIC AXIS: Gonadotropins are secreted in pulses, following the pulses of GnRH secretion. In adult women, <b>nycthemeral</b> variations in LH are strongly modulated by the menstrual cycle. MELATONIN: The nychtemeral pattern of melatonin is an excellent marker of the circadian clock. Diurnal concentrations are low and vary little whereas peak levels are observed in the middle of the night. Melatonin rhythmicity is not influenced by sleep, but is dependent on exposure to light and darkness. English AbstractJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tResearch Support, U. S.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the <b>nycthemeral</b> rhythm of total locomotor activity (TLA) in horseand the possible involvement of the daily organization of rest/activity cycles in the fluctuation of the redoxstate. For this purpose we recorded TLA and determined oxidative markers in ten clinically healthy ItalianSaddle horses. TLA was continuously recorded by means of an actigraphy-based data logger(Actiwatch-Mini®). For the assessment of free radicals (dROMs), the antioxidant barrier (Oxy-ads) and thethiol-antioxydant barrier (SHp), blood samples were collected every 4 hours over a 48 h period. One-wayrepeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a statistically significant effect of time of day onall studied parameters. The application of the periodic model and the statistical analysis of cosinor indicate,in horses, the existence of a daily rhythm of the studied parameters during the 48 h of monitoring. The resultsshow that <b>nycthemeral</b> rhythms of TLA and oxidative markers have different trends in horse. dROMs andOxy-ads showed a <b>nycthemeral</b> rhythm with an acrophase in the middle of the photophase, and the acrophaseof SHp <b>nycthemeral</b> rhythm preceded them. In contrast, TLA showed its acrophase only after the middle ofthe photophase. TLA showed a lower robustness of rhythms (16. 3 and 20. 3 %) and in respect to the robustnessvalues of the rhythms of oxidative markers (67. 3 – 86. 2 %). In conclusion, the results of the presentinvestigation showed that oxidative markers have different patterns than locomotor activity, and furtherstudies could be necessary to determine whether other external stimuli, such as solar radiation, foodadministration or physical exercise are able to influence redox state rhythms in this species...|$|E
40|$|Aim:To {{evaluate}} possible <b>nycthemeral</b> {{and seasonal}} temporal patterns in fish assemblage associated with limnological aspects and biotic factors in two reservoirs in semarid Northeastern Brazil. MethodsFish were sampled with gillnets in <b>nycthemeral</b> cycles throughout the dry and rainy season in two reservoirs (Paulo Sarasate/PS and Edson Queiroz/EQ). The stomach {{contents of the}} predator species were surveyed. The limnological variables were submitted to principal components analysis, while their relation to fish abundance was determined by canonical correspondence analysis. Temporal patterns in relative fish species abundance were detected with nMDS. ResultsTemperature and dissolved oxygen levels segregated the reservoirs physico-chemically. Turbidity and chlorophyll-a levels differed between seasons, and the relative abundance of species differed between the reservoirs. Predators were more abundant in PS, while detritivores were more abundant in EQ. Triportheus signatusand Plagioscion squamosissimus were the most abundant species in both reservoirs. In general, predator abundance was positively associated with high temperature and dissolved oxygen (PS>EQ) and negatively associated with turbidity. The activity patterns of P. squamosissimus could not be explained by fluctuations in environmental variables. Non-predators tended to cluster around the vectors chlorophyll-a, pH and turbidity. Predators had a more diversified diet in PS in accordance with food availability, while predators in EQ ate only fish and shrimp. <b>Nycthemeral</b> patterns varied for the same species depending on the reservoir. Generally, in PS predators were more active during daylight hours while non-predators were more active after dark. However, in EQ predators and non-predators displayed similar <b>nycthemeral</b> activity patterns. Regardless of the reservoir, predators were more abundant in the rainy season. No seasonal trend was observed for non-predators. ConclusionsLimnological differences between PS and EQ influenced temporal species abundance patterns.

40|$|AbstractThe {{increase}} in acetylcholine yielded by pyridostigmine (PYR), an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, was evaluated for {{its effect on}} the haemodynamic responses—mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) —and their <b>nycthemeral</b> oscillation in mice before and one week after myocardial infarction (MI). Mice were anesthetized (isoflurane), and a telemetry transmitter was implanted into the carotid artery. After 5 days of recovery, the MAP and HR were recorded for 48 h (10 s every 10 min). Following this procedure, mice were submitted to surgery for sham or coronary artery ligation and received drinking water (VEHICLE) with or without PYR. Five days after surgery, the haemodynamic recordings were recommenced. Sham surgery combined with VEHICLE did not affect basal MAP and HR; nevertheless, these haemodynamic parameters were higher during the night, before and after surgery. MI combined with VEHICLE displayed decreased MAP and increased HR; these haemodynamic parameters were also higher during the night, before and after surgery. Sham surgery combined with PYR displayed similar results for MAP as sham combined with VEHICLE; however, PYR produced bradycardia. Nevertheless, MI combined with PYR exhibited no change in MAP and HR, but these haemodynamic parameters were also higher during the night, before and after surgery. Therefore, MI decreased MAP and increased HR, while PYR prevented these alterations. Neither MI nor PYR affected <b>nycthemeral</b> oscillations of MAP and HR. These findings indicate that the {{increase in}} acetylcholine yielded by PYR protected the haemodynamic alterations caused by MI in mice, without affecting the <b>nycthemeral</b> haemodynamic oscillations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Nycthemeral</b> (daily) {{oscillation}} {{has been}} documented {{in a variety of}} physiological and behavioral processes. The present study was carried out to evaluate the existence of a <b>nycthemeral</b> rhythm of human sexual behavior and to identify environmental factors responsible for the rhythmic pattern. Methods Non-traditional university students (ages 18 to 51 years) recorded the times of day when they went to sleep, when they woke up, and when they had sex for 3 consecutive weeks. They also answered a questionnaire designed to identify the causes of their selection of time for sex. Results The majority of sexual encounters took place at bedtime (11 pm to 1 am). The most common explanations for this temporal pattern were the rigidity of the professional work schedule and family obligations and the availability of the partner, which reduced the opportunity for sexual encounters at other times of the day. Conclusion Most sexual encounters take place around bedtime. Although the presence of an endogenous component responsible for this temporal pattern cannot be excluded, the evidence indicates strong environmental forcing, particularly from the work/family schedule of the individuals and from partner availability. </p...|$|E

At each site, abiotic factors were measured as follows: air temperature, surface water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and electric conductivity. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of abiotic and biological data and sampling periods was made using CANOCO program; RESULTS: A total of 249 and 265 Odonata larvae from six genera (Acanthagrion, Cyanallagma, Telebasis, Erythemis, Erythrodiplax and Tauriphila) were sampled in association with macrophytes in wet and dry seasons, respectively. Telebasis presented the highest frequency of occurrence and was collected in all <b>nycthemeral</b> cycle sampling periods in both seasons. The highest abundance of dragonflies was recorded at 6 : 00 AM and 12 : 00 AM in wet and dry seasons, respectively. Anoxia was detected in wet season during the entire <b>nycthemeral</b> cycle, while in the dry season, the highest variability in oxygen content was observed during sunlight. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that the abundances of Telebasis and Erythemis were positively related to water electrical conductivity, temperature, and depth, while for Acanthagrion and Tauriphila, abundance showed a positive relationship to water oxygen and pH. The variability of the abundance of Odonata due to surface water temperature, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, pH, and depth during the daily cycle was therefore evidenced; CONCLUSIONS: We suggested that the better sampling period Odonata larvae must to be carried in the morning, since that we recorded the highest densities of both wet and dry stations at that hour. We point out that our data must to be examined with caution because the low sampling effort and the reduced taxonomic resolution...|$|E

The present investigation was aimed at testing the existence of a daily rhythm of TRP and 5 -HT in the blood of athletic horses. Methods Blood samples from 5 Thoroughbred mares were collected at 4 -hour intervals for 48 hours (starting at 08 : 00 hours on day 1 and finishing at 4 : 00 on day 2) via an intravenous cannula inserted into the jugular vein.

The objective was to verify whether alterations occurred in the wealth and diversity indices of Anopheles, following two successive floods, extended to {{the temporal}} activity and <b>nycthemeral</b> rhythm followed over a five year period. METHODS: Mosquito capture was performed monthly using the Human Attraction Technique and Shannon Traps. The first, executed for 24 h, provided the <b>nycthemeral</b> rhythm and the second, lasting 15 h, permitted the tracking of Anopheles during the two floods. RESULTS: The bimodal pattern of Anopheles darlingi defined before these floods was modified throughout the environment interventions. The same effect had repercussions on the populations of An albitarsis s. l., An triannulatus and An galvaoi. Activity prior to twilight was less affected by the environment alterations.

The {{aim of this study}} was to understand cyanobacterial population dynamics in the rainy and dry seasons at two depths in the Arcoverde reservoir. Microalgae and cyanobacteria samples were collected during 24 hours with intervals of 4 hours (<b>nycthemeral)</b> at sub-surface and 10 m using a van Dorn bottle and a determined biomass. Physical and chemical variables were obtained and the data were analyzed using the principal component analysis (PCA). No <b>nycthemeral</b> variations in the taxonomic composition or distribution of the populations of cyanobacteria were found between the different times of day in either the rainy or dry season. In both seasons, the greatest biomass of the phytoplankton community was made up of cyanobacteria at two depths and all times of the day. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Woloszynska) Seenayya et Subba Raju was dominant at all times of the day on both the surface and at the bottom. In the rainy season, the differences in cyanobacterial biomass between the surface and bottom were less significant than in the dry season. The differences in cyanobacterial biomass between surface and bottom were less pronounced than those found in the dry season. We concluded that a) physical variables better explain the alterations of species in the phytoplankton community in an environment dominated by cyanobacteria throughout the year; b) seasonal climatic factors associated to periods of stratification and de-stratification are important for alterations in the community and variations in biomass and, c) the turbidity caused by rainfall favored the emergence and establishment of other cyanobacteria, especially Planktothrix agardhii (Gomont) Anagnostidis & Komárek...|$|E

We tried to overcome the effects of small sample size and minimize type II error by performing a robust and restrictive statistical analysis. In addition, as mentioned before, the small sample size may have limited the study’s power to detect differences in cytokine concentrations. We also had no data on markers of endothelial injury. Finally, the use of dynamic markers of illness severity (such as daily changes in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score) could have been useful to further interpret the association between ΔMPV and prognosis.

30|$|Typical ECG tracings of rats {{exposed to}} air (control) or {{phosgene}} have been published elsewhere [42]. Due {{to the lack of}} a common isoelectric baseline, each cycle was established on its own reference level. One of the unique electrophysiological characteristics of the rat ECG is the absence of a Q wave and the lack of an isoelectric ST-segment. Consequently, there is no clear separation between the QRS complex and the T-wave. The change in heart rate (sinus bradycardia), which was among the most prominent findings distinguishing phosgene-exposed rats from controls, attained a nadir approximately 4  h post-exposure (Fig.  2). The time-course changes observed in control rats were attributed to the rats’ nocturnally increasing activity (<b>nycthemeral</b> biorhythm). Other cardiological changes that were observed were considered to be adaptive and secondary to bradycardia, i.e., functional changes typical of afferent pulmonary C fiber J receptor stimulation (increased AT). Continued bradycardia after exposure to phosgene and other signs typical of excessive parasympathetic tone have also been observed in humans [75, 76]. Although vagotomy and parasympatholytic drugs (atropine) prevented or abolished the neurogenic etiopathology of phosgene, they did not affect pulmonary edemagenesis [75, 77].|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the biomass and density of the zooneuston communities in relation to the upper and lower layers (epi-/hyponeuston), the <b>nycthemeral</b> variation (day/night), the currents in relation to the island (downstream vs upstream), and the distance from the island, focusing on the spatial variability. Samples were taken in July and August 2010 with a David-Hempel neuston net (Hydro-Bios) with a mesh size of 500 µm. Twenty-one taxa were recorded. The most abundant taxa were Copepoda, Chaetognatha, Teleostei (eggs) and Hydrozoa. This is the first record of phoronid larvae for the waters of the Tropical Atlantic. For both layers, density and biomass were significantly higher at night. Density and biomass were always significantly higher in the upper (epineuston) layer than in the lower (hyponeuston) layer. This was probably due to a zooneuston aggregation at the surface and massive vertical migration from deep waters at night, leading to increased abundances at night in both neuston layers...|$|E
40|$|Melatonin, {{which shows}} a robust <b>nycthemeral</b> rhythm, {{plays the role}} of an endogen-ous synchronizer, able to {{stabilize}} and reinforce circadian rhythms and maintain their mutual phase relationships. Additionally, melatonin is a potent antioxidant and dis-plays immunological properties. Because free radical generation, immune dysfunc-tion, and sleep and metabolic disorders are involved in the short- and long-term pathophysiology of the burn syndrome, we undertook the study of daily urine mela-tonin, 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT 6 s, the main hepatic melatonin metabolite), and cortisol variations plus temperature profiles in burn patients using a non-invasive protocol. Eight patients (6 males, 2 females) were studied on three occasions after admission to the intensive care unit (early session: days 1 to 3; intermediate session: day 10; late session: days 20 to 30). Melatonin, aMT 6 s, and free cortisol levels were determined in urine samples collected at 4 h intervals over a continuous 24 h span. Core temperature was recorded daily. Controls consisted of healthy subjects in the same age range. Cosinor analysis of the data provided an evaluation of mesor, ampli-tude, and acrophase of circadian rhythms. Also, we calculated day (D), night (N), an...|$|E
40|$|Implantation of a {{solid source}} of oestradiol into ovariectomized rats {{produced}} constant plasma concentrations of the hormone {{over a long period}} of time. Under these conditions, LH is released in a circadian pattern with a very marked peak in the afternoon. This circadian rhythm is synchronized to the light=n- cycle, since it follows exactly a shift in the <b>nycthemeral</b> cycle. The first peak appeared on day 3 after placement of the oestrogen implant; its amplitude was constant from days 3 to 9 after implantation, and decreased gradually during prolonged implantation. The afternoon peak was not correlated with changes in the pituitary sensitivity to exogenous LH releasing hormone (LH-RH), since the LH response to increasing doses of the peptide could be superimposed in the morning and in the after-noon. However, the decreased amplitude of the rhythm observed after more than 9 days of implantation seemed to depend upon a progressive desensitization of the pituitary gland to LH-RH. Pituitary LH content also decreased as a function of implantation time. It is concluded that, under conditions of constant plasma oestradiol concentrations and of constant pituitary sensitivity to LH-RH, a daily activation of the neural trigger releasing pituitary gonadotrophins occurs...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that opioid peptides {{are involved in the}} stimulation of food intake in rats and that the circulating beta-endorphin levels are increased in genetically obese rodents. Therefore, to assess whether the changes in food intake may influence circulating beta-endorphin levels in obese subjects, plasma beta-endorphin, ACTH and cortisol concentrations were determined in obese patients after an oral glucose load and during a 7 -day total starvation. Baseline plasma beta-endorphin concentrations were significantly higher in obese patients than in control normal-weight subjects, while ACTH and cortisol levels were similar in both groups. Plasma beta-endorphin, ACTH and cortisol concentrations were not affected by the ingestion of 75 g glucose, neither were plasma beta-endorphin concentrations modified during prolonged starvation. Moreover, the lack of <b>nycthemeral</b> variations in beta-endorphin levels, documented before and during starvation while plasma ACTH and cortisol were significantly reduced in the evening, suggests that some extra anterior pituitary sources or some obesity-related changes in beta-endorphin metabolism may contribute to the pool of circulating beta-endorphin in obese subjects. On the other hand, even the extreme changes in nutritional conditions, such as total food deprivation or glucose ingestion, are devoid of any detectable influence on circulating beta-endorphin levels...|$|E
40|$|International audienceContinuous Glucose Monitoring(CGM) devices allow sensor {{augmented}} pump {{therapy for}} type- 1 diabetic patients. They are also useful for physicians to analyze <b>nycthemeral</b> glycemic profile and glucose variability. Noise, deviations, loss of sensitivity and spikes are common sources of error in CGM readings. An off-line wavelet algorithm {{has been developed}} to denoise the CGM signal. A typical CGM noise was added to a simulated blood glucose concentration. The objective is to maximize the signal to noise ratio. The Haar wavelet basis has been selected. The chosen scale J of decomposition gives a sequence of scale coefficients which contains an approximation of the signal at the resolution scale J, and a family of detail coefficients dj, 1 ≤ j ≤ J. Optimal scale of decomposition and threshold levels are computed. CGM data from 16 type- 1 diabetic patients were used for this study. The optimal threshold levels were used to denoise the CGM signal off-line. The results showed that noise, deviations, loss of sensitivity and spikes {{were removed from the}} signal; likely pikes and nadirs were not damped; the algorithm dealt with loss of signal. This algorithm can provide a pre-processing tool for model fitting and allows an accurate reading of CGM to facilitate analysis by the physicians...|$|E
40|$|Interpreting fish {{community}} records {{is challenging}} for several reasons, including {{the lack of}} past ichthyofauna data, the cyclical temporal variations in the community, and the methodology employed, which usually underestimates fish assemblages. The objective {{of this study was}} to describe short-scale and meso-scale (<b>nycthemeral</b> period and months, respectively) temporal variations in the ichthyofauna composition and structure of a sheltered beach of Ba&# 237;a Norte (Florian&# 243;polis, Santa Catarina state, Brazil), using a cap&# 233;chade net. Samples were collected monthly for a period of 48 hours. During the period from December 2010 to November 2011, a total of 19, 302 individuals belonging to 89 species and 39 families were captured. The number of individuals that were sampled during the day and/or night was dependent on the sampling month. On average, the daytime assemblage was more abundant and different in structure and composition than the nighttime assemblage. Of the eight species that had the highest Index of Relative Importance (%IRI), five had higher variations (ANOVA F) between the day and night than between the months. This finding reinforced the need for sampling during both the day and night. The cap&# 233;chade net effectively captured demersal and pelagic individuals in a broad range of sizes...|$|E
40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of daily changes in surface water abiotic factors on the abundance of Odonata larvae and the genus richness in a lateral lake isolated from a tropical river during the <b>nycthemeral</b> cycle in dry and wet seasons; METHODS: Macrophytes were sampled on a single day at 6 -hours intervals for 24 hours (at 12 : 00 AM, 6 : 00 AM, 12 : 00 PM and 6 : 00 PM) in dry and wet periods. At each site, abiotic factors were measured as follows: air temperature, surface water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and electric conductivity. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of abiotic and biological data and sampling periods was made using CANOCO program; RESULTS: A total of 249 and 265 Odonata larvae from six genera (Acanthagrion, Cyanallagma, Telebasis, Erythemis, Erythrodiplax and Tauriphila) were sampled in association with macrophytes in wet and dry seasons, respectively. Telebasis presented the highest frequency of occurrence and was collected in all <b>nycthemeral</b> cycle sampling periods in both seasons. The highest abundance of dragonflies was recorded at 6 : 00 AM and 12 : 00 AM in wet and dry seasons, respectively. Anoxia was detected in wet season during the entire <b>nycthemeral</b> cycle, while in the dry season, the highest variability in oxygen content was observed during sunlight. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that the abundances of Telebasis and Erythemis were positively related to water electrical conductivity, temperature, and depth, while for Acanthagrion and Tauriphila, abundance showed a positive relationship to water oxygen and pH. The variability of the abundance of Odonata due to surface water temperature, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, pH, and depth during the daily cycle was therefore evidenced; CONCLUSIONS: We suggested that the better sampling period Odonata larvae must to be carried in the morning, since that we recorded the highest densities of both wet and dry stations at that hour. We point out that our data must to be examined with caution because the low sampling effort and the reduced taxonomic resolution. OBJETIVO: O objetivo deste trabalho foi investigar os efeitos da variação diária de oxigênio e da temperatura de superfície da água e outros fatores abióticos sobre a abundância e a riqueza de larvas de Odonata em uma lagoa isolada de um rio tropical durante o ciclo nictemeral nas estações seca e chuvosa; MÉTODOS: As macrófitas foram amostradas em um único dia por 24 horas em intervalos de 6 horas (00 : 00, 6 : 00, 12 : 00 e 18 : 00) nos períodos seco e chuvoso. Em cada sitio de amostragem foram medidos a temperatura do ar, temperatura de superfície da água, oxigênio dissolvido, pH e condutividade. Uma análise de correspondência canônica (ACC) foi realizada no programa Canoco com os dados abióticos, biológicos e períodos de amostragem; RESULTADOS: Um total de 249 e 265 larvas de Odonata de seis gêneros (Acanthagrion, Cyanallagma, Telebasis, Erythemis, Erythrodiplax and Tauriphila) foram amostradas junto à macrófita nas estações seca e chuvosa, respectivamente. Telebasis apresentou a maior freqüência de ocorrência e foi amostrado em todo ciclo nictemeral em ambas estações. A maior abundância de Odonata foi registrada às 6 : 00 e 12 : 00 nas estações chuvosa e seca, respectivamente. Um período anóxico foi detectado durante toda a estação chuvosa, enquanto que no período seco a maior variabilidade de oxigênio foi observada durante o dia. A Análise de Correspondência Canônica mostrou que as abundâncias de Telebasis e Erythemis foram positivamente correlacionadas com a condutividade elétrica, temperatura e profundidade, enquanto que Acanthagrion e Tauriphila mostraram correlação positiva com o oxigênio e com o pH. Portanto, foi observada uma variância na abundância de Odonata com temperatura, oxigênio, condutividade, pH e profundidade durante o período de 24 horas; CONCLUSÕES: Nós sugerimos que o melhor período de amostragem de larvas de Odonata deve ser pela manhã, pois neste período registramos as maiores densidades nas estações seca e chuvosa. Destacamos que os resultados deste trabalho devem ser interpretados com cautela devido ao baixo esforço amostral e reduzida resolução taxonômica...|$|E
