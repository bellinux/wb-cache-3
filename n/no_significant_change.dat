5|$|Technetium plays {{no natural}} {{biological}} role {{and is not}} normally found in the human body. Technetium is produced in quantity by nuclear fission, and spreads more readily than many radionuclides. It appears to have low chemical toxicity. For example, <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> in blood formula, body and organ weights, and food consumption could be detected for rats which ingested up to 15µg of technetium-99 per gram of food for several weeks. The radiological toxicity of technetium (per unit of mass) {{is a function of}} compound, type of radiation for the isotope in question, and the isotope's half-life.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} de Saulles in 1903 {{had led to}} the {{abolition}} of the post of Engraver, and coins for George V, who took the throne on Edward's death in 1910, were subject to a design competition won by Bertram Mackennal, who also prepared the medal for the Coronation. The King apparently liked his work, as he was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order in 1911 and knighted in 1921. The inscription around the left-facing bust reads GEORGIVS V DEI GRA BRITT OMN REX FID DEF IND IMP, while <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> was made to the reverse design. The new bronze coins were made current by proclamation dated 28 November 1910, effective 1 January 1911.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression was poorly organized, {{with much of}} the convection located well to the southeast of the broad center due to strong upper-level wind shear. The shearing environment was caused by a trough in the Gulf of Mexico and from the outflow from Pacific Hurricane Celia. This was reflected in forecasts, with the National Hurricane Center predicting <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> in intensity or structure. The depression moved northward before turning to the northeast, and on June 26 the poorly organized system made landfall just north of Tampa, Florida. The low-level circulation dissipated while crossing the Florida peninsula, with the remnants continuing northeastward before being absorbed by a large extratropical cyclone over the western Atlantic.|$|E

The most substantial difference was that Snow used MIDI files to save his musical scores and pieces, which would afterward be sent to a copyist who would take it through one of their programs and eventually give it to the orchestrators.|$|E
5|$|While Bertha was {{approaching}} Atlantic Canada, a tropical wave emerged into an Atlantic {{from the west}} coast of Africa, and quickly developed into Tropical Depression Four 336mi (540.7km) south of Cape Verde. The depression headed northwestward due to the weakness of a subtropical ridge and slowly intensified. While the depression was well west of Cape Verde, it intensified into Tropical Storm Cesar on August 2. Cesar continued on the generally northwestward path and <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> in intensity occurred, as it peaked at 50mph (85km/h) shortly after becoming a tropical storm. Later in its duration, wind shear significantly increased, causing the low-level circulation to be removed from the deep convection on August 6, and Cesar weakened back to a tropical depression as a result. As it was weakening to a tropical depression, Cesar became nearly stationary, and turned abruptly eastward. On the following day, Cesar dissipated almost 1,151mi (1,852.3km) east-southeast of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|For several hours, steady {{strengthening}} {{continued as}} the depression maintained a westward track. Operationally, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Julia early on September13, though post-analysis confirmed {{the storm had}} reached winds of 40mph (65km/h) twelve hours after formation. For several hours, <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> occurred in its intensity or organization as Julia passed near Cape Verde, though the storm gradually retraced to the west-northwest along the southern periphery of a deep-layer ridge. Slow intensification resumed as the storm bypassed the Cape Verde islands; by early September14, it displayed a ragged, banded eye-like feature in satellite imagery. Due to locally high sea surface temperatures of about 28°C (82°F), a period of rapid intensification subsequently commenced; within hours, Julia attained Category 1 hurricane status. Though located over an area with relatively low oceanic heat content, Julia continued to intensify rapidly under low vertical wind shear and over favorable sea surface temperatures; as such, the hurricane was upgraded to Category2 status on September 15. In less than two hours, the hurricane deepened to reach Category3 intensity, becoming the fourth major hurricane of the season. The rapid intensification trend continued, and Julia eventually strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane six hours later. Based on satellite estimates, its winds peaked at 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 948mbar (hPa; 27.99inHg), though operationally estimated at 135mph (215km/h) and 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg), respectively.|$|E

25|$|Sildenafil's {{popularity}} with young adults has {{increased over the}} years. Sildenafil's trade name, Viagra, is widely recognized in popular culture, and the drug's association with treating erectile dysfunction has led to its recreational use. The reasons behind such use include {{the belief that the}} drug increases libido, improves sexual performance, or permanently increases penis size. Studies on the effects of viagra when used recreationally are limited, but suggest it has little effect when used by those not suffering from erectile dysfunction. In one study, a 25-mg dose was shown to cause <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> in erectile quality, but did reduce the postejaculatory refractory time. This study also noted a significant placebo effect in the control group.|$|E
25|$|The {{consensus}} {{of most of}} the investigating commissions was that the initial break took place at or near the fault line, which had been a problem area since water first covered the area, on the western abutment. The prevailing thought was that increasing water percolation through the fault line had either undermined or weakened the foundation to a point that a portion of the structure blew out or the dam collapsed from its own immense weight. This agreement among them was also due, in conjunction, with a chart which was made by the automatic water level recorder located on the dam’s center section. This chart clearly showed that there had been <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> in the reservoir level until forty minutes before the dam’s failure when, during that forty minutes, a small though gradually increasing amount of loss was recorded.|$|E

25|$|On 1 November 2011 TEPCO {{said that}} xenon-133 and xenon-135 were {{detected}} in gas-samples {{taken from the}} containment vessel of reactor 2, in a concentration of 6 to 10 (or more) parts per million becquerels per cubic centimeter. Xenon-135 was also detected in gas samples collected on 2 November. These isotopes {{are the result of}} nuclear fission-reaction of uranium. Because the short half-lifes of these gases: (Xe-133: 5 days Xe-135: 9 hours), the presence could only mean that nuclear fissions were occurring at some places in the reactor. Boric-acid was poured into the reactor in an attempt to stop the fission-reactions. <b>No</b> <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> in temperature or pressure was found by TEPCO, so {{there was no sign of}} large-scale criticality. The reactor-cooling was continued, but TEPCO would examine the situation at reactor 1 and 3 also. Professor Koji Okamoto of the University of Tokyo Graduate School made the comment that localized and temporary fission might still happen, and that the melted fuel could undergo fission, but the fuel was probably scattered around. Neutrons from radioactive materials could react with the uranium fuel and other substances. Self-sustaining chain reactions were unlikely, thanks to the huge amounts of boric acid that were poured into the reactor.|$|E
25|$|Early on 17 March, TEPCO {{requested}} {{another attempt}} by the military to put water on the reactor using a helicopter and four helicopter drops of seawater took place around 10:00 JST. The riot police used a water cannon to spray water onto {{the top of the}} reactor building and then were replaced by members of the SDF with spray vehicles. On 18 March, a crew of firemen took over the task with six fire engines each spraying 6 tons of water in 40 minutes. 30 further hyper rescue vehicles were involved in spraying operations. Spraying continued each day to 23 March because of concerns the explosion in Unit 3 may have damaged the pool (total 3,742 tonnes of water sprayed up to 22 March) with changing crews to minimise radiation exposure. Lighting in the control room was restored on 22 March after a connection was made to a new grid power supply and by 24 March it was possible to add 35 tonnes of seawater to the spent fuel pool using the cooling and purification system. On 21 March grey smoke was reported to be rising from the southeast corner of Unit 3 – where the spent fuel pool is located. Workers were evacuated from the area. TEPCO claimed <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> in radiation levels and the smoke subsided later the same day.|$|E
500|$|The king's {{interpretation}} of the phenomenon, however, was that <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>change</b> was presaged, as the [...] "six or eight sun dogs on {{a circle around the}} true sun, have apparently disappeared, and the true natural sun has remained itself". [...] He then concluded that nothing was [...] "much different, since the unchristian treason that Anders Hansson and several of that party had brought against His Highness, was not long thereafter unveiled". The king referred to the so-called [...] "Gun Powder Conspiracy" [...] uncovered in 1536, which aimed at murdering him by a blasting charge hidden under his chair in the church. This resulted in various death sentences and expatriations, including Mint Master Anders Hansson who was accused of being a counterfeiter.|$|E
