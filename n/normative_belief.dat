50|$|While most {{models are}} {{conceptualized}} within individual cognitive space, {{the theory of}} planned behavior considers social influence such as social norm and <b>normative</b> <b>belief,</b> based on collectivistic culture-related variables. Given that an individual's behavior (e.g., health-related decision-making such as diet, condom use, quitting smoking and drinking, etc.) {{might very well be}} located in and dependent on the social networks and organization (e.g., peer group, family, school and workplace), social influence has been a welcomed addition.|$|E
50|$|Another {{application}} {{of the theory of}} planned behavior is in the field of environmental psychology. Generally speaking, actions that are environmentally friendly carry a positive <b>normative</b> <b>belief.</b> That is to say, sustainable behaviors are widely promoted as positive behaviors. However, although there may be a behavioral intention to practice such behaviors, perceived behavioral control can be hindered by constraints such as a belief that one's behavior will not have any impact. For example, if one intends to behave in an environmentally responsible way but {{there is a lack of}} accessible recycling infrastructure, perceived behavioral control is low, and constraints are high, so the behavior may not occur. Applying the theory of planned behavior in these situations helps explain contradictions between sustainable attitudes and unsustainable behavior.|$|E

Security-oriented <b>normative</b> <b>beliefs</b> are negatively related to both fund-raising success and to staff job attitudes. Team-work-oriented norms are positively related to staff attitudes. How are behaviors or beliefs linked to organizational success? Despite the popularity of culture {{as a means of}} promoting high performance (Deal & Kennedy, 1982; Peters & Waterman, 1982; Waterman, 1987), little system-atic research (e. g., cross-sectional, standardized measurement) exists on the link between culture or related concepts of values and <b>normative</b> <b>beliefs</b> and either organizational performance or individual member responses (see Denison, 1984, for an exception).

Mothers are supposed to prioritize the needs of dependent children above all other activities.

The cultural norm that mothers should always be there for their children coexist in tension with the <b>normative</b> <b>belief</b> of the “ideal worker” should always be there for his or her employer. These normative conceptions of an “ideal worker” and a “good mother” create a cultural tension between the motherhood role and the committed worker role. These conflicting roles can lead employers to engage in normative discrimination, in which they recognize the competence of mothers but believe that it is their duty to remain at home with their children.|$|E
50|$|Self-categorization theory’s {{account of}} social {{influence}} differs from other social psychological approaches to social influence. It rejects the traditional distinction between informational influence and normative influence, where informational influence involves {{the assessment of}} social information based on its merit and normative influence involves public compliance to the expectations of group members. For self-categorization theory social information does not have merit independent of self-categorization. Instead, information is perceived as valid {{to the extent that}} it is perceived to be a <b>normative</b> <b>belief</b> of the ingroup. Normative influence, on the other hand, is not normative at all. Rather, it is counter-normative influence based compliance to expectations of psychological outgroup members. In a similar vein self-categorization theory also challenges the distinction between objective reality testing and social reality testing (e.g. the elaboration likelihood model). It argues that there is no such thing as objective reality testing isolated from social reality testing. Sensory data is always interpreted with respect of the beliefs and ideas of the perceiver, which in turn are bound up in the psychological group memberships of that perceiver.|$|E
5000|$|The {{study of}} values {{has a long}} history in {{psychological}} research, for instance Rokeach's value scale, which has been used widely. That focus has also been transferred to the study of culture in psychology. The anthropologists Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck conducted a large-scale study of values in five Southwestern US cultures in the 1950s. However, it was Geert Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory that really initiated the wave of cross-cultural research on values. His four (later increased to six) dimensions of cultural values have become a major tool in many kinds of cross-cultural research.Values, however, have important limitations for predicting behavior. A value states that, [...] "X is good/desirable/important," [...] but it does not indicate if a person thinks that X is obtainable. A belief, on the other hand, is a statement about how things work in reality. A social axiom, according to Leung and Bond's (2002) definition, describes how the world and society are believed to work. In other words, [...] "...a typical social axiom has the structure - A is related to B. A and B can be any entities, and the relationship can be causal or correlational." [...] The strength of a belief can vary from person to person. Furthermore, a social axiom is different from a <b>normative</b> <b>belief.</b> Normative beliefs tell us what we ought to do, e.g., be polite to everyone.

40|$|The study {{examined}} how attitudes and subjective norms {{could be used}} to predict participation intention of adults in continuing education. In this research, attitudes comprised the two variables of positive attitude and negative attitude and subjective norms included <b>normative</b> <b>belief</b> and motivation to comply. Structural equation modeling using a maximum likelihood estimator was used to test the data collected from 752 adult respondents in Hong Kong, China. The results indicated that the relationships between positive attitude, negative attitude, <b>normative</b> <b>belief</b> and participation intention were significant. The relationship between motivation to comply and participation intention was found insignificant. However the strong relationship between motivation to comply and positive attitude revealed the indirect influence of motivation to comply on participation intention through positive attitude. The result also disclosed the phenomenon that <b>normative</b> <b>belief</b> was a better predictor of participation intention in continuing education than positive and negative attitudes in this context. The Theory of Reasoned Action (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975) was used as the basis of reference in developing the conceptual framework of this study. The revised attitudes towards continuing education scales (Blunt, 2002) were shown to have validity in terms of the direct association with the various attitudes of adults towards continuing education.

40|$|Background: Documenting {{feedback}} during clinical supervision using {{field notes}} (FN) is a recommended competency-based evaluation strategy {{that will require}} changes {{in the culture of}} medical education. This study identified factors influencing the intention to adopt FN in family medicine training, using the theory of planned behaviour. Methods: This mixed-methods study involved clinical teachers (CT) and residents from two family medicine units. Main outcomes were: 1) intention (and its predictors: attitude, perceived behavioural control (PBC) and <b>normative</b> <b>belief)</b> to use FN, assessed using a 7 -item Likert scale questionnaire (1 : strongly disagree to 7 : strongly agree) and 2) related salient beliefs, explored in focus groups three and six months after FN implementation. Results: 27 CT and 28 residents participated. Intention to use FN was 6. 20 ± 1. 20 and 5. 74 ± 1. 03 in CT and residents respectively. Predictors of this intention were attitude and PBC (mutually influential: p = 0. 04), and <b>normative</b> <b>belief</b> (p = 0. 007). Focus groups identified underlying beliefs regarding their use (perceived advantages/disadvantages and facilitators/barriers). Conclusion: Intention to adopt field notes to document competency is influenced by attitude, perceived behavioural control and <b>normative</b> <b>belief.</b> Implementation of field notes should be preceded by interventions that target the identified salient beliefs to improve this competency-based evaluation strategy...|$|E

Selected food items were weighed and organized by food group and compared to USDA recommendations by child's age, gender and activity level. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Spearman's rho correlation coefficients, and multivariate linear regression modeling. On average, mothers offered their children more fruit (237 %) and meat (153 %) but less vegetables (75 %), dairy (79 %) and grain (65 %) than what is recommended. Mothers of 2 year olds selected greater quantity of food compared to mothers of 3 year old children for all food groups except dairy (p < 0. 05).

This {{research}} project examined {{the factors that}} affect (1) business owners' decisions {{about whether or not}} to make their facilities accessible to disabled persons, and (2) citizens' beliefs that businesses need to provide access for disabled persons. Using M. Fishbein and I.

Business owners and members of the general public who were not business owners were surveyed as to their beliefs about providing access. Through the use of multiple regression analysis, it was discovered that business owners and citizens differ in what issues they find important with regard to businesses providing access for disabled persons. Business owners' decisions about providing access were most strongly affected by the issue of the cost involved and by their social <b>normative</b> <b>beliefs.</b> Business owners tended to believe that providing access would be costly, and were therefore less willing to provide access. Citizens were like business owners in being affected by social <b>normative</b> <b>beliefs,</b> but differed from business owners in that they were affected by personal <b>normative</b> <b>beliefs</b> rather than the issue of cost. Citizens were more affected by the belief that business owners have a social and/or moral responsibility to provide access than with their belief that providing access would be costly.
