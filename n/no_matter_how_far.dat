5|$|Although Galileo seriously {{considered}} the priesthood {{as a young}} man, at his father's urging he instead enrolled at the University of Pisa for a medical degree. In 1581, when he was studying medicine, he noticed a swinging chandelier, which air currents shifted about to swing in larger and smaller arcs. To him, it seemed, by comparison with his heartbeat, that the chandelier took {{the same amount of}} time to swing back and forth, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> it was swinging. When he returned home, he set up two pendulums of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and the other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together. It was not until the work of Christiaan Huygens, almost one hundred years later, that the tautochrone nature of a swinging pendulum was used to create an accurate timepiece. Up to this point, Galileo had deliberately been kept away from mathematics, since a physician earned a higher income than a mathematician. However, after accidentally attending a lecture on geometry, he talked his reluctant father into letting him study mathematics and natural philosophy instead of medicine. He created a thermoscope, a forerunner of the thermometer, and, in 1586, published a small book on the design of a hydrostatic balance he had invented (which first brought him to the attention of the scholarly world). Galileo also studied disegno, a term encompassing fine art, and, in 1588, obtained the position of instructor in the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in Florence, teaching perspective and chiaroscuro. Being inspired by the artistic tradition of the city and the works of the Renaissance artists, Galileo acquired an aesthetic mentality. While a young teacher at the Accademia, he began a lifelong friendship with the Florentine painter Cigoli, who included Galileo's lunar observations in one of his paintings.|$|E

Early on in the anime series, before they become friends, this connection forcibly transforms Mamoru into Tuxedo Mask {{so that he can}} protect her. In later episodes, he seems to have control over his transformations, although he still shows up shortly after the start of most of the battles, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> away from the developing situation.|$|E
50|$|Rotational {{speed is}} not to be {{confused}} with tangential speed, despite some relation between the two concepts. Imagine a rotating merry-go-round. <b>No</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> close or <b>far</b> you stand from the axis of rotation, your rotational speed will remain constant. However, your tangential speed does not remain constant. If you stand two meters from the axis of rotation, your tangential speed will be double the amount if you were standing only one meter from the axis of rotation.|$|R

He also claimed that, other than being told to [...] "just keep people off the stage", Cutler gave the Hells Angels very little specific instructions for stage security: [...] "They didn't say nothing to us about any of that." [...] And although the Angels are not security guards, [...] "If we say we're going to do something, we do it.

Space is {{infinite}} in all directions; so is dharmakaya. Dharmakaya is all-pervasive and totally infinite, beyond any confines or limitations. This is so for the dharmakaya of all buddhas. There is no individual dharmakaya for each buddha, as there is no individual space for each country.|$|E
25|$|The pilot episode {{followed}} {{significantly different}} rules {{from the current}} ones. Most noticeably, only eight letters were selected for each letters round. If two contestants offered a word of the same length, or an equally close solution to a numbers game, then only the contestant who made the selection for that round was awarded points. Also, only five points were given for an exact numbers solution, three for a solution within 5, and one point for the closer solution, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> away.|$|E

He bristled, however, at what he felt were media intrusions into his personal life, for example when the Toronto Star reported that he had gone on a date. Fox was left unsure whom he could trust in the media after negative articles began to emerge, including one by the Globe and Mail that characterized him as a [...] "tyrannical brother" [...] who verbally abused Darrell and claimed he was running because he held a grudge against a doctor who had misdiagnosed his condition, allegations he referred to as [...] "trash".|$|E

2500|$|A {{critic of}} antisemitism, Eugen Relgis also {{dedicated}} {{some of his}} main works in the essay genre {{to the cause of}} anti-fascism. Early on, he exposed claims about Judeo-Masonic domination as canards, and noted that antisemitism was a negative reaction to the Jews' own status as natural innovators in both politics and culture. He wrote: [...] "I take antisemitism to be that psychological disease whose manifestations display the characteristics of a phobia, that is to say an obsession. When someone is obsessed with an image, an individual or even a collective entity, these become the center of their world—and all causes and effects, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> apart and different from each other, are connected to the initial obsession." ...|$|E

[...] The August 2006 issue of Motor Trend magazine has a sidebar with Newman, in which he explains that Kowalski sees the light glinting from between the two bulldozers. [...] "To Kowalski, it was still a hole to escape through. It symbolized that <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> they push or chase you, no one can truly take away your freedom and there is always an escape." [...] Newman also thought that the entire film was an essay on existentialism. Kowalski drives to drive, with no real purpose for doing what he's doing.

2500|$|... "Unfortunately, {{because men}} were {{foolish enough to}} treat with an armed enemy within their gates, the English won the peace. Weakness and treachery caused a {{resumption}} {{of the war and}} the old English tactics of `divide and conquer' were exploited to the fullest extent. Partition was introduced, the country divided into two parts with two separate Parliaments subject to and controlled by the British Government. The armed forces of England still occupy six of our counties in the North and reserve the right `in time of war or strained relations' to reoccupy the ports which they have just evacuated {{in the southern part of}} Ireland. Ireland is still tied, as she has been for centuries past, to take part in England's wars. In the Six Counties, a large number of Republican soldiers are held prisoners by England. Further weakness on the part of some of our people, broken faith and make-believe, have postponed the enthronement of the living Republic, but the proclamation of Easter Week and the declaration of independence stand and must stand for ever. No man, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> he has fallen away from his national faith, has dared to repudiate them.

[...] Wesley Morris in The Boston Globe mused that if the film didn't [...] "float your boat as a work of science-fiction, action, philosophy, heliocentrism, or staggering visual spectacle (although, it really should), then it certainly succeeds as a parable for cinematic ambition."
