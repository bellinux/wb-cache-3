5|$|Although {{the prior}} {{introduction}} of the Princess Royal class had provided the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) with more powerful locomotives to be used on the main line between London Euston and Glasgow Central, {{the board of directors}} were persuaded in 1936 that more such locomotives would be needed, particularly as they were being asked to approve the introduction of a new <b>non-stop</b> <b>service</b> between those cities, designated the Coronation Scot. Initially, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, William Stanier, planned to build five more Princess Royals, but the Chief Technical Assistant and Chief Draughtsman at the LMS Derby Works, Tom Coleman, argued that it would be preferable to design a new class of locomotive that was more powerful, more reliable and easier to maintain. Stanier was convinced and the drawing office commenced designing the new class. When Stanier was called on to perform an assignment in India, Coleman became responsible for most of the detailed design in his absence.|$|E
