2500|$|In a 2017 {{literature}} {{review by the}} National Academy of Sciences, they explain the positive impact of illegal immigrants on natives in the following way:The entry of new workers through migration {{increases the likelihood of}} filling a vacant position quickly and thus reduces the net cost of posting new offers. The fact that immigrants in each skill category earn less than natives reinforces this effect. Though immigrants compete with natives for these additional jobs, the overall number of new positions employers choose to create is larger than the number of additional entrants to the labor market. The effect is to lower the unemployment rate and to strengthen the bargaining position of workers.According to Georgetown University economist Anna Maria Mayda and University of California, Davis economist Giovanni Peri, [...] "deportation of undocumented immigrants not only threatens the day-to-day life of several million people, it also undermines the economic viability of entire sectors of the US economy." [...] Research shows that illegal immigrants complement and extend middle- and high-skilled American workers, making it possible for those sectors to employ more Americans. Without access to illegal immigrants, U.S. firms would be incentivized to offshore jobs and import foreign-produced goods. Several highly competitive sectors that depend disproportionately on illegal immigrant labor, such as agriculture, would dramatically shrink and sectors, such as hospitality and food services, would see higher prices for consumers. Regions and cities that have large illegal populations are also likely to see harms to the local economy were the illegal immigrant population removed. While Mayda and Peri note that some low-skilled American workers would see marginal gains, {{it is likely that the}} effects on <b>net</b> <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> and wages would be negative for the U.S. as a whole.|$|E

At the national level, this analysis confirmed the existence of considerable differences in employment performance between and within the various country aggregations. Empirical analysis highlighted the remarkable <b>net</b> <b>job</b> <b>creations</b> in the EU- 15 (and EMU- 12) for the period 1997 - 2003, accompanied by a (national) convergence for all three employment indicators. As regards total employment rates, significant converging trends also emerge at the regional level for both EU- 15 and EMU- 12 aggregations. In the eight Central European Countries, new EU members (8 CEC-NM), a diverging trend in the total employment rate began in 1999, whereas converging dynamics were limited to the employment rate of older workers in the period 1998 - 2001. Regional analyses showed significant diverging dynamics in the total employment rates (1999 - 2003) for the eight CEC-NM regions. At the national level of analyses, the relationship between "progress in transition" and employment performance was also briefly examined.

40|$|Abstract: Small and {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) are {{the backbone of}} all economies and are a key source of economic growth, dynamism and flexibility in advanced industrialized countries, {{as well as in}} emerging and developing economies. SMEs constitute the dominant form of business organization, accounting for over 95 % and up to 99 % of enterprises depending on the country. They are responsible for between 60 - 70 % <b>net</b> <b>job</b> <b>creations</b> in OECD countries. Small businesses are particularly important for bringing innovative products or techniques to the market. Financing is necessary to help them set up and expand their operations, develop new products, and invest in new staff or production facilities. Many small businesses start out as an idea from one or two people, who invest their own money and probably turn to family and friends for financial help in return for a share in the business. But if they are successful, there comes a time for all developing SMEs when they need new investment to expand or innovate further. That is where they often run into problems, because they find it much harder than larger businesses to obtain financing from banks, capital markets or other suppliers of credit. This “financing gap ” is all the more important in a fast-changing knowledge-based economy because of the speed of innovation. Innovative SMEs with high growth potential, many of them in high-technology sectors, have played a pivotal role in raising productivity and maintaining competitiveness in recent years. If SMEs cannot find the financing they need, brilliant ideas may fall by the wayside and this represents a loss in potential growth for the economy...|$|R

The results show that increases in the enforcement of labor market regulations at the subnational level led to an increase in gross and <b>net</b> formal <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> rates and accession rates in a period when the Brazilian GDP and formal employment were growing and informality rates were declining. In contrast, increases in enforcement of regulations are not significantly correlated with changes in the rate of job destruction.

40|$|This is {{the first}} paper to study <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> and {{destruction}} in EU agriculture. We disaggregate gross employment patterns and <b>net</b> <b>job</b> flows into detailed intra-sectoral labour adjustment dynamics based on a unique EU-wide farm level panel dataset for 1990 - 2005. We find that: (1) <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> and destruction rates in EU agriculture are comparable to other sectors; (2) {{there is some evidence}} of ongoing substitution of family labour for hired labour (3) there are important differences in <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> and destruction rates between different Member States; (4) these differences can be attributed to structural differences across countries, sectors and farm types; (5) time variation of job reallocation fluctuates countercyclically; (6) idiosyncratic effects are the main driver of time variance in job reallocation.
