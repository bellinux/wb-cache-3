5|$|In 1776, {{following}} {{the signing of}} the Declaration of Independence and the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, Maryland threw off proprietary control and established a <b>new</b> <b>constitution.</b> Under this <b>new</b> <b>constitution,</b> the upper house of the General Assembly first became known as the Maryland Senate. The new body consisted of fifteen Senators appointed to five-year terms by an electoral college. The college, made up of two electors from each county and one each from the cities of Baltimore and Annapolis, was limited in its selections only by the stipulation that nine Senators need be from the western shore and six from the eastern shore.|$|E

5|$|In 1851, a {{new state}} {{constitution}} was created and ratified. Among the constitution's new clauses was {{an extension of the}} terms of representatives to two years and senators to four years. It also made many of the previously appointed positions open to public election. The <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> delegated many minor tasks to newly created elected offices. With its workload considerably decreased, instead of meeting annually, the General Assembly only convened a session every two years. The <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> also placed new limits on the General Assembly's power to create local laws, the General Assembly having become notorious for creating state level laws that were only applied to one town or county.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, Goebel was a {{delegate}} to Kentucky's fourth constitutional convention, which produced the current Kentucky Constitution. Despite the high honor of being chosen as {{a delegate}}, Goebel showed {{little interest in}} participating {{in the process of}} creating a <b>new</b> <b>constitution.</b> The convention was in session for 250 days; Goebel was present for just 100 of them. He did, however, successfully secure the inclusion of the Railroad Commission in the <b>new</b> <b>constitution.</b> As a constitutional entity, the Commission could only be abolished by an amendment ratified by popular vote. This would effectively protect the Commission from ever being unilaterally dismantled by the General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant-Colonel J. S. V. Hickman {{took over}} from Caine as {{commanding}} officer on 26 August 1968 {{and the rest}} of the year was uneventful for the RLI. The same was not true, however, for the Rhodesian government, which on 20 September 1968 accepted an invitation from Wilson for a new round of talks, this time aboard HMS Fearless, anchored off Gibraltar, for four days starting on 9 October 1968. These ended without agreement on the evening of 13 October 1968, when Smith flew back to Rhodesia. Unsuccessful attempts by both sides to salvage an accord from the Fearless talks continued for months afterwards but ultimately Smith's government resolved that compromise was impossible. It prepared a <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> of its own and on 20 June 1969 called a constitutional referendum, polling public opinion on both the <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> and the adoption of a republican form of government. The electorate firmly backed both of these proposals. As a result, Rhodesia became a republic with the <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> in place on 2 March 1970.|$|E
40|$|Africa's <b>new</b> <b>constitutions</b> {{have arisen}} from a dynamic of {{relative}} globalization {{in an era}} of Western preeminence. Thus, they are both barometers and instruments of international policy. The method of constitutional ecology can be used to measure the impact of international policy by examining the degree to which human rights have been firmly entrenched in Africa's <b>new</b> <b>constitutions.</b> It is also possible to measure the relative extent to which the international viewpoint has been taken into account in the internal order. As "barometers", the instrumentality of Africa's <b>new</b> <b>constitutions</b> is in relation to their being templates of the international legal order. Hence the principle of constitutionality (or "constitutional bases") of official diplomacy...|$|R
5000|$|<b>New</b> Zealand <b>Constitution</b> Amendment Act 1947 (as {{a result}} of the <b>New</b> Zealand <b>Constitution</b> (Request and Consent) Act 1947) ...|$|R
50|$|The Act {{formally}} remained part of <b>New</b> Zealand's <b>constitution</b> {{until it}} was repealed by the <b>New</b> Zealand <b>Constitution</b> Act 1852.|$|R
5|$|On 17 January 2013, Vice President John Nkomo died {{of cancer}} at St Anne's Hospital, Harare {{at the age of}} 78. A <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> {{approved}} in the Zimbabwean constitutional referendum, 2013 curtails presidential powers.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, 1874, the <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> was {{completed}} {{and signed by}} a majority of delegates. The entire electorate, including the disenfranchised Confederates and the Freedmen, voted. The election not only was for ratification of the <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> but also for state officials that would be elected if the constitution was indeed ratified. The Republicans actually took the same position that the Democrats had taken earlier, believing that the election was illegal they nominated no candidates. Conservative Democrats and allied paramilitary groups suppressed black voting, using a combination of intimidation, blocking blacks from the polls, and outright assassinations. The <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> was ratified on October 13, 1874 and Democratic officials elected almost unanimously, including new Democratic Governor Augustus H. Garland who was inaugurated November 12, 1874, and Baxter left office after only serving two years of a four-year term.|$|E
5|$|After {{being pushed}} back repeatedly, a {{constitutional}} referendum {{was held on}} 17 November 2010 that resulted in adoption of the state's fourth constitution with 73% in favor and a voter turnout of 52.6%. The independent Malagasy political watchdog group KMF-CNOE, {{as well as the}} political opposition and the international community, cited numerous irregularities in the process, which was carried out unilaterally by the HAT. The constitution in effect at the time Rajoelina took office required that presidential candidates attain a minimum of 40 years of age. One substantive change made by the <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> was to lower the minimum age for presidential candidates from 40 to 35, making Rajoelina eligible to stand in presidential elections. In addition, the <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> mandated the leader of the High Transitional Authority – the position held by Rajoelina – be kept as interim president until an election could take place. The <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> also contained a clause that required presidential candidates to have lived in Madagascar for at least six months prior to the elections, effectively barring Ravalomanana and other opposition leaders living in exile from running in the next election. After being repeatedly postponed, the general election was held on 25 October 2013.|$|E
5000|$|A {{collective}} presidency existed in Yugoslavia {{at the federal}} level since amendments to the constitution in 1971. On 21 February 1974 a <b>new</b> federal <b>Constitution</b> was adopted which reaffirmed the collective federal presidency chaired by the President of the Presidency. The constituent republics adopted the same system in <b>new</b> <b>constitutions</b> of their own.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{adoption}} of the <b>newest</b> <b>constitution</b> of 2010 and the presidential elections, Mahamadou Issoufou was elected as the first president of the Seventh Republic.|$|R
50|$|Other Southern states created <b>new</b> <b>constitutions</b> with {{provisions}} {{similar to}} those of Mississippi's through 1908, effectively disfranchising hundreds of thousands of blacks {{and tens of thousands of}} poor whites for decades.|$|R
5|$|After the {{adoption}} of a <b>new</b> <b>Constitution</b> in 1923, the traditional local administrative systems of the newly acquired regions of Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia were made uniform in 1925 with that of the Romanian Old Kingdom. County borders were kept largely intact, with few adjustments, and the total number of counties was raised to 71; this lasted until the beginning of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Article Seven of the {{proposed}} Constitution set the terms by which the new frame of government would be established. The <b>new</b> <b>Constitution</b> would become operational when ratified by at least nine states. Only then would it replace the existing government under the Articles of Confederation and would apply only to those states that ratified it.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} {{opposition}} to slavery, Garrard did not take a particularly {{active role in the}} convention's proceedings. His most notable action not related to slavery occurred on April 13, 1792, when he reported twenty-two resolutions from the committee of the whole that provided the framework for the <b>new</b> <b>constitution.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{new code}} of Canon Law of 1917 {{opened the door}} for the Bernardines to refind their Cistercian identity. <b>New</b> <b>Constitutions</b> were {{approved}} in 1937, which recognized the Bernardines as Cistercians.|$|R
25|$|The 1830s were {{years of}} liberal {{regeneration}} and 12 cantons with liberal majorities enacted <b>new</b> <b>constitutions</b> with radical {{changes in the}} relationship between state and churches, especially putting education under government control.|$|R
25|$|Both the {{military}} coup of 1960 and {{the military}} coup of 1980 were followed by fundamental revisions of the Turkish Constitution. The texts of the <b>new</b> <b>constitutions</b> was approved by popular referendum in each case.|$|R
5|$|Hamilton {{was among}} those {{dissatisfied}} with the weak national government. He led the Annapolis Convention, which successfully influenced Congress to issue a call for the Philadelphia Convention {{in order to create}} a <b>new</b> <b>constitution.</b> He was an active participant at Philadelphia, and he helped achieve ratification by writing 51 of the 85 installments of The Federalist Papers which, to this day, are the single most important reference for Constitutional interpretation.|$|E
5|$|In 1833, William {{signed a}} <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> for Hanover, which {{empowered}} the middle class, gave limited {{power to the}} lower classes, and expanded {{the role of the}} parliament of Hanover. The constitution was revoked after William's death by the new king, William's brother, Ernest Augustus.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, the community, perpetually {{struggling}} financially, drafted {{an entirely}} <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> {{and committed to}} following more closely the Fourierist model. Not everyone at the community supported the transition, and many left. Many were disappointed that the new, more structured daily routine de-emphasized the carefree leisure time {{that had been a}} trademark. Ripley himself became a celebrity proponent of Fourierism and organized conventions throughout New England to discuss the community.|$|E
50|$|In March 2016 {{both the}} Malek Fahd Islamic School, and the Islamic School of Canberra cut their {{ties with the}} AFIC and with other Australian Islamic schools {{registering}} <b>new</b> <b>constitutions</b> and declaring independence from the AFIC.|$|R
50|$|The 1844 <b>New</b> Jersey <b>Constitution</b> is {{the second}} state {{constitution}} for the State of New Jersey {{and was replaced by}} the current state constitution adopted in 1947. It was preceded by the 1776 <b>New</b> Jersey <b>Constitution.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Ecuador's and Bolivia's <b>new</b> <b>constitutions</b> {{state the}} {{indigenous}} concept of [...] "good life" [...] ("buen vivir" [...] in Spanish, [...] "sumak kawsay" [...] in Quichua, and [...] "suma qamaña" [...] in Aymara) as {{the goal of}} sustainable development.|$|R
5|$|Indiana put further {{restrictions}} on African Americans, prohibiting them from testifying {{in court in}} a case against a white man. The <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> of 1851 expanded suffrage for white males, but excluded blacks from suffrage. While the state did not have legal segregation, it excluded black children from public schools {{as a matter of}} custom.|$|E
5|$|Many other {{military}} figures, such as bunker designer Josif Zagali, were also {{caught up in}} the 1974 purges. The introduction of a <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> two years later sealed Hoxha's absolute control of the military by appointing him as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and Chairman of the Defence Council.|$|E
5|$|Nasser's {{nomination}} {{for the post}} and the <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> were put to public referendum on 23 June and each was approved by an overwhelming majority. A 350-member National Assembly was established, elections for which were held in July 1957. Nasser had ultimate approval over all the candidates. The constitution granted women's suffrage, prohibited gender-based discrimination, and entailed special protection {{for women in the}} workplace. Coinciding with the <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> and Nasser's presidency, the RCC dissolved itself and its members resigned their military commissions as part of the transition to civilian rule. During the deliberations surrounding the establishment of a new government, Nasser began a process of sidelining his rivals among the original Free Officers, while elevating his closest allies to high-ranking positions in the cabinet.|$|E
50|$|Due to the Revolution, {{and based}} on the state of affairs between the US and Great Britain, the Scottish Provincial Grand Lodge drafted <b>new</b> <b>constitutions,</b> {{breaking}} from the Grand Lodge of Scotland and becoming Massachusetts Grand Lodge in 1782.|$|R
50|$|In 1595 Pope Clement VIII {{exempted}} {{the reform}} from all jurisdiction {{on the part}} of Cistercian abbots, and allowed the Feuillants to draw up <b>new</b> <b>constitutions,</b> containing some relaxations of the initial austerities. These were approved the same year.|$|R
50|$|The first {{sisters were}} sent to Michigan in 1872. In the 1920s the {{community}} decided to change its status from a diocesan to a papal community. This led {{to the adoption of}} <b>new</b> <b>constitutions</b> and a change of habit.|$|R
