25|$|SFO {{was one of}} {{the first}} U.S. {{airports}} to conduct a residential sound abatement retrofitting program. Established by the FAA in the early 1980s, this program evaluated the cost effectiveness of reducing interior sound levels for homes near the airport, within the 65 CNEL <b>noise</b> <b>contour.</b> The program made use of a noise computer model to predict improvement in specific residential interiors for a variety of noise control strategies. This pilot program was conducted for a neighborhood in South San Francisco and success was achieved in all of the homes analyzed. The costs turned out to be modest, and the post-construction interior sound level tests confirmed the predictions for noise abatement. To date over $153 million has been spent to insulate more than 15,000 homes in the neighboring cities of Daly City, Pacifica, San Bruno, and South San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|The Hercules site gained {{independence}} from Dupont {{as a result}} of federal anti-trust action in 1912. Hercules Powder Company contributed significantly to the production of explosives during both World Wars. By the Second World War, the plant had diversified to produce fertilizers and other chemical products. Eventually the facility was out-competed by foreign manufacturers, and the plant was closed in 1976. However, by this time the surrounding area was experiencing rapid growth as the commuter belt moved further outward from San Francisco. By the mid-1970s, home construction companies began to build new subdivisions and changed Hercules into the residential suburb as it was known up until the late 1990s. Back in the 1970s, Hercules {{was one of the first}} cities in the United States to develop a comprehensive Noise Element of the General Plan. This work included the production of <b>noise</b> <b>contour</b> maps for all major highways and arterial roads, as well as a citywide mitigation plan.

40|$|The {{atmosphere}} modifies the emitted {{sound waves}} of an aircraft during propagation {{and is therefore}} important in the calculation of <b>noise</b> <b>contours</b> or synthesis. <b>Noise</b> <b>contours</b> present the resulting noise levels {{on the ground and}} are, as such, often applied for regulatory purposes. Aircraft noise synthesis is a technique that allows to transform a calculated prediction into audible sound that can be experienced in a virtual reality environment. Noise synthesis techniques allow people to be subjected to aircraft, routes or procedures that are still being designed. This dissertation describes recent research to improve the modeling of atmospheric propagation effects in aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>contours</b> as well as aircraft noise synthesis. Multi-event <b>noise</b> <b>contours</b> are usually calculated with standardized models that take non-standard propagation into account in an empirical fashion. A propagation algorithm was developed to augment such a model. Signal processing steps can be applied to transform a source noise prediction into an audible result. Furthermore, such steps can be utilized to apply propagation effects to a source noise signal. For a non-standard atmosphere this is not trivial. The role of a non-standard atmosphere is described by a dedicated simulation framework developed in this dissertation. The framework is applied to a flyover to demonstrate the effects associated with multiple ray paths and shadow zones. Besides demonstrating non-standard atmospheric effects, the framework was used to create synthesized results of actual flyovers near an airport. Subsequently, a comparison between measured results and synthesized results was executed. Furthermore, a method was designed to include the effect of turbulence-induced coherence loss of the direct and ground reflected ray in noise synthesis.

The two-runway airport is less than 20 miles west of Central London and is completely surrounded by urban development, leaving no room to build additional runways to cater for additional air passenger demand. Due to the UK’s prevailing southwesterly winds, aircraft predominately approach Heathrow over Central London.

50|$|In {{the case}} of airport expansions, courts {{consistently}} upheld {{the sovereignty of the}} FAA over the EPA, in allowing air traffic needs to be met over environmental concerns. Thus airports were required to study impacts of air traffic and facilities expansions and provide detailed <b>noise</b> <b>contour</b> maps, but in the final analysis the EPA exposure guidelines only advisory in nature. To respond to the shortcomings of the voluntary guidelines, FAA created a well funded program to insulate thousands of homes in the vicinity of major airports. The program was based upon computer modeling of alternative insulation strategies, calculated on a house-by- house basis. While this program did nothing to mitigate exterior sound levels, it benefited residential interiors significantly.|$|E

40|$|One {{might expect}} that houses closer to an airport and those in higher {{minority}} population neighborhoods experience more airport noise. We find evidence supporting these conjectures when estimating a standard ordered probit model for houses sold near the Atlanta airport. However, because the various neighborhood demographics surrounding the airport can be heterogeneous, and the <b>noise</b> <b>contours</b> are not necessarily correlated with distance in certain neighborhoods, we hypothesize that the impacts of explanatory variables on the probability of greater noise vary across space. We explore spatial heterogeneity by estimating ordered probit locally weighted regressions (OPLWR). These results differ from those using a standard ordered probit model. Moreover, we find notable differences in parameter estimates for different observations (i. e., houses). Even in relatively small areas, our results imply that the standard ordered probit model can generate biased estimates. Airports; Regional economics...|$|R

It has taken into account jet noise source, fuel consumption, aircraft constraints and its operational extreme limits. Additionally, {{in spite of the}} fact that the maximum input values of the aircraft speed, the throttle setting and altitudes are kept free, the method gives reliable results. It is fast, errors are weak, and calculations are exact with a suitable convergence time.
