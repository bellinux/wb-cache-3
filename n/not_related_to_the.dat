5|$|The {{crash of}} another DC-10 {{at the end}} of November, Air New Zealand Flight 901, exactly six months after Flight 191, added to the DC-10's {{negative}} reputation. The crash of Flight 901, an Antarctic sightseeing flight which hit a mountain, was caused by several human and environmental factors <b>not</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> airworthiness of the DC-10, and the aircraft was later completely exonerated in that accident.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Bramlette {{issued a}} general pardon for most ex-Confederates in the state.

5|$|Although Gan {{had little}} education, he {{realised}} its value as he prospered and became wealthy. His dream {{to build a}} school for the poor which taught both English and Chinese (Hokkien, as Mandarin was not commonly used in Southeast Asia then) was fulfilled in 1885, when he built the Anglo-Chinese Free School for boys in some shophouses in Telok Ayer Street (<b>not</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Chinese School founded a year later by Bishop W.F. Oldham). In 1923, it was renamed to Gan Eng Seng School (GESS) in his honour.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{was born}} on December 28, 1933 in Lexington, Kentucky. He was the only son of the five {{children}} born to John Y. and Dorothy (Inman) Brown. His father {{was a member of}} the U.S. Congress from Kentucky and a member of the Kentucky state legislature for nearly three decades, including a term as Speaker of the House. John Sr. was named for, but <b>not</b> <b>related</b> <b>to,</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth century governor of the same name. A 1979 People magazine article recounts that the elder Brown's nine unsuccessful political races – for either governor or the U.S. Senate – took a toll on his family and left his mother resentful of all the money spent on campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a similar}} overall appearance, A.hygrometricus is <b>not</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> true earthstars of genus Geastrum, {{although}} historically, {{they have been}} taxonomically confused. The species was first described by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801 as Geastrum hygrometricus. In 1885, Andrew P. Morgan proposed that differences in microscopic characteristics warranted {{the creation of a}} new genus Astraeus distinct from Geastrum; this opinion was not universally accepted by later authorities. Several Asian populations formerly thought to be A.hygrometricus were renamed in the 2000s once phylogenetic analyses revealed they were unique Astraeus species, including A.asiaticus and A.odoratus. Research has revealed the presence of several bioactive chemical compounds in the fruit bodies. North American field guides typically rate A.hygrometricus as inedible.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, Moxon and Carla Smith had a daughter, Stacy Grove Meyer. Meyer died on June 25, 2000 {{after she}} {{fell off a}} ladder and was {{electrocuted}} after touching a 7,200-volt wire while working at Golden Era Productions. Golden Era Productions was cited by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health for improper wiring precautions near a vault where Grove Meyer had been working. The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigated the incident, and determined that her death was <b>not</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> safety violations at the facility. Grove Meyer had worked for two years at Golden Era Productions in landscaping and maintenance.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, the Supreme Court held in Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer) (2002), that a {{statutory}} provision prohibiting prisoners serving {{a sentence of}} two years or more from voting unjustifiably infringed the fundamental right to vote guaranteed by section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court noted that the Government could not demonstrate how denying prisoners the vote helped the stated aims of the relevant statute; a democracy built on inclusiveness, democracy and citizen participation cannot be party to a law that disenfranchises a considerable part of the population. There was also no credible theory why prisoners should be {{denied the right to}} vote as a form of punishment, as it is arbitrary and <b>not</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> offender's criminal act nor does it deter crime or rehabilitate criminals.|$|E
5|$|NATO {{increased}} its naval {{presence in the}} Black Sea significantly following the Russian invasion, with ships docking in Georgian ports, {{and according to the}} US Navy, delivering humanitarian aid. NATO said that its presence in the Black Sea was <b>not</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Georgian crisis; its vessels were conducting typical visits and preplanned naval exercises with Romania and Bulgaria. Russian General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn reminded NATO of the limit on the number of vessels allowed in the Black Sea under the 1936 Montreux convention. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev questioned the claim that ships going to Georgia were bringing only humanitarian assistance, alleging the delivery of military material. According to political analyst Vladimir Socor, the US maintained a continual presence in the Black Sea. The ships were rotated {{from time to time in}} the Black Sea because of the constraints on ship's weight and length of visits set by the Montreux Convention.|$|E

5|$|Roger was {{the eldest}} brother of William, but died childless during their father's lifetime. The next son, John, {{inherited}} the family lands, but died around 1149 without children. William then inherited the lands. John and William had a sister called Margaret, {{who was the}} wife of Haimo de St Clair. Their father married a second time, and had a son named Simon by that marriage. William took his surname from his mother's family, as did his half-brother Simon, who was <b>not</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chesney family except by marriage. Two further children of Robert's, Elias and Peter, are known, but whether they were {{the children of the}} first marriage or the second is unclear. Chesney should be distinguished from another William de Chesney, who controlled the town of Oxford and its castle as well as the town of Deddington and its castle in the same time period.|$|E
5|$|The American Red Cross {{called it}} a major disaster, but getting relief into the area was stalled because of {{landslides}} blocking the ridge route running between Los Angeles and Kern counties. California State Route 99 was also blocked by a landslide ten miles south of Gorman, but the highway was quickly reopened later in the day. All aircraft <b>not</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> relief effort were ordered not to land at the Tehachapi Municipal Airport. All 417 inmates from the Tehachapi Prison for Women were evacuated because of damage; the California Department of Corrections stated that the facility was left unusable. Most of the injured received medical care at Kern County General Hospital and some sought treatment at Tehachapi Valley Hospital, where some existing patients were moved {{to make room for}} new arrivals.|$|E
5|$|The Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii) {{is a large}} Australian predatory {{freshwater}} fish of the Maccullochella genus and the Percichthyidae family. Although the species is called a cod in the vernacular, it is <b>not</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Northern Hemisphere marine cod (Gadus) species. The Murray cod {{is an important part}} of Australia's vertebrate wildlife—as an apex predator in the Murray-Darling River system—and also significant in Australia's human culture. The Murray cod is the largest exclusively {{freshwater fish}} in Australia, and one of the largest in the world. Other common names for Murray cod include cod, greenfish, goodoo, Mary River cod, Murray perch, ponde, pondi and Queensland freshwater cod.|$|E
