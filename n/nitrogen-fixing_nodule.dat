40|$|Legumes {{have evolved}} {{symbiotic}} interactions with rhizo-bial bacteria to efficiently utilize nitrogen. Recent progress in symbiosis has revealed several {{key components of}} host plants required for <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>nodule</b> organogenesis, in which complicated metabolic and signaling pathways in the host plant are reprogrammed to generate nodules in the cortex upon perception of the rhizobial Nod factor. Following the recognition of Nod factors, plant hormones {{are likely to be}} essential throughout nodule organogenesis for integration of developmental and environmental signal-ing cues into nodule development. Here, we review the molecular events involved in plant hormonal regulation and signaling cross-talk for <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>nodule</b> devel-opment, and discuss how these signaling networks are integrated into Nod factor-mediated signaling during plant-microbe interactions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{symbiotic}} {{interaction between}} Rhizobium bacteria and legumes {{leads to the}} induction of a new root organ: the <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>nodule.</b> Recent findings have uncovered that cytokinin is instrumental in this developmental process, but they also suggest a broader role for cytokinin in mediating rhizobial infection. In this opinion article, we propose that cytokinin is the key differentiation signal for nodule organogenesis. Furthermore, we discuss a model in which cytokinin might also influence bacterial infection by controlling the expression of NIN (Nodule Inception) and other transcriptional regulators through mechanisms operating both locally and systemically...|$|E

40|$|Postembryonic {{development}} of plant organs requires a constant interplay between the cell cycle and the developmental programs. Upon endo- and exogenous signals, plant cells can enter, exit or modify the cell cycle. Alteration of mitotic cycles to endoreduplication cycles, where the genome is duplicated without mitosis, {{is common in}} plants and {{may play a role}} in cell differentiation. The switch from the mitotic to endocycles is regulated by Ccs 52 A, a plant orthologue of the yeast and animal Cdhl proteins, acting as substrate-specific activator of the anaphase-promoting complex E 3 ubiquitin ligase.

40|$|The {{evolution}} and persistence of biological cooperation {{have been an}} important puzzle in evolutionary theory. Here, we suggest a new approach based on bargaining theory to tackle the question. We present a mechanistic model for negotiation of benefits between a <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>nodule</b> and a legume plant. To that end, we first derive growth rates for the nodule and plant from metabolic models of each {{as a function of}} material fluxes between them. We use these growth rates as pay-off functions in the negotiation process, which is analogous to collective bargaining between a firm and a workers' union. Our model predicts that negotiations lead to the Nash bargaining solution, maximizing the product of players' pay-offs. This work introduces elements of cooperative game theory into the field of mutualistic interactions. In the discussion of the paper, we argue for the benefits of such an approach in studying the question of biological cooperation...|$|E

The ability of these Exo- mutants to induce functioning nodules on Leucaena plants was restored by coinoculation with a Sym plasmid-cured (Nod- Exo+) derivative of parent strain NGR 234, purified EPS from the parent strain, or the oligosaccharide from the EPS. Coinoculation with EPS or related oligosaccharide also resulted in formation of <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>nodules</b> on siratro plants.

40|$|International audiencePhytohormonal {{interactions}} {{are essential to}} regulate plant organogenesis. In response {{to the presence of}} signals from symbiotic bacteria, the Nod factors, legume roots generate a new organ: the <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>nodule.</b> Analysis of mutants in the Medicago truncatula CRE 1 cytokinin receptor and of the MtRR 4 cytokinin primary response gene expression pattern revealed that cytokinin acts in initial cortical cell divisions and later in the transition between meristematic and differentiation zones of the mature nodule. MtCRE 1 signaling is required for activation of the downstream nodulation-related transcription factors MtERN 1, MtNSP 2 and MtNIN, as well as to regulate expression and accumulation of PIN auxin efflux carriers. Whereas the MtCRE 1 pathway is required to allow the inhibition of polar auxin transport in response to rhizobia, nodulation is still negatively regulated by the MtEIN 2 /SICKLE-dependent ethylene pathway in cre 1 mutants. Hence, MtCRE 1 signaling acts as a regulatory knob, integrating positive plant and bacterial cues to control legume nodule organogenesis...|$|E

40|$|In plants, {{root system}} {{architecture}} {{is determined by}} the activity of root apical meristems, which control the root growth rate, and by the formation of lateral roots.

The CRA 2 gene encodes a Leucine-Rich Repeat Receptor-Like Kinase (LRR-RLK) that primarily negatively regulates lateral root formation and positively regulates symbiotic nodulation. Grafting experiments revealed that CRA 2 acts through different pathways to regulate these lateral organs originating from the roots, locally controlling the lateral root development and nodule formation systemically from the shoots.

One subclone spanning 32 kilobase pairs (kb) of DNA from pRt 843 a was found to restore nitrogen fixation ability. This subclone included all known nodulation genes of R. trifolii ANU 843 and the nitrogenase structural genes nifHDK. In addition, regions homologous to fixABC, nifA, nifB, nifE, and nifN genes of other nitrogen-fixing bacteria were identified in this 32 -kb subclone by DNA-DNA hybridization. Transposon mutagenesis of this subclone confirmed that regions containing these nif and fix genes were required for induction of <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>nodules</b> on clover.

40|$|The {{formation}} of a <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>nodule</b> requires the coordinated development of rhizobial colonization and nodule organogenesis. Based on its mutant phenotype, lumpy infections (lin), LIN functions {{at an early stage}} of the rhizobial symbiotic process, required for both infection thread growth in root hair cells and the further development of nodule primordia. We show that spontaneous nodulation activated by the calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase is independent of LIN; thus, LIN is not necessary for nodule organogenesis. From this, we infer that LIN predominantly functions during rhizobial colonization and that the abortion of this process in lin mutants leads to a suppression of nodule development. Here, we identify the LIN gene in Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus, showing that it codes for a predicted E 3 ubiquitin ligase containing a highly conserved U-box and WD 40 repeat domains. Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation is a universal mechanism to regulate many biological processes by eliminating rate-limiting enzymes and key components such as transcription factors. We propose that LIN is a regulator of the component(s) of the nodulation factor signal transduction pathway and that its function is required for correct temporal and spatial activity of the target protein(s) ...|$|E
40|$|Legume plants {{adapt to}} low {{nitrogen}} by developing an endosymbiosis with nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria {{to form a}} new specific organ: the <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>nodule.</b> In the Medicago truncatula model legume, the MtCRE 1 cytokinin receptor is essential for this symbiotic interaction. As three other putative CHASE-domain containing histidine kinase (CHK) cytokinin receptors exist in M. [*]truncatula, we determined their potential contribution to this symbiotic interaction. The four CHKs have extensive redundant expression patterns at early nodulation stages but diverge in differentiated nodules, even though MtCHK 1 /MtCRE 1 has the strongest expression at all stages. Mutant and knock-down analyses revealed that other CHKs than MtCHK 1 /CRE 1 are positively involved in nodule initiation, which explains the delayed nodulation phenotype of the chk 1 /cre 1 mutant. In addition, cre 1 nodules exhibit an increased growth, whereas other chk mutants have no detectable phenotype, and the maintained nitrogen fixation capacity in cre 1 requires other CHK genes. Interestingly, an AHK 4 /CRE 1 genomic locus from the aposymbiotic Arabidopsis plant rescues nodule initiation but not the nitrogen fixation capacity. This indicates that different CHK cytokinin signalling pathways regulate not only nodule initiation but also later developmental stages, and that legume-specific determinants encoded by the MtCRE 1 gene are required for later nodulation stages than initiation...|$|E
40|$|Type 3 {{effector}} proteins secreted via the bacterial type 3 secretion system (T 3 SS) are {{not only}} virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria, but also influence symbiotic interactions between <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>nodule</b> bacteria (rhizobia) and leguminous host plants. In this study, we characterized NopM (nodulation outer protein M) of Rhizobium sp. strain NGR 234, which shows sequence similarities with novel E 3 ubiquitin ligase (NEL) domain effectors from the human pathogens Shigella flexneri and Salomonella enterica. NopM expressed in Escherichia coli, but not the non-functional mutant protein NopM-C 338 A, showed E 3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro. In vivo, NopM, but not inactive NopM-C 338 A, promoted nodulation of the host plant Lablab purpureus by NGR 234. When NopM was expressed in yeast, it inhibited mating pheromone signaling, a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. When expressed in the plant Nicotiana benthamiana, NopM inhibited {{one part of the}} plant’s defense response, as shown by a reduced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to the flagellin peptide flg 22, whereas it stimulated another part, namely the induction of defense genes. In summary, our data indicate the potential for NopM as a functional NEL domain E 3 ubiquitin ligase. Our findings that NopM dampened the flg 22 -induced ROS burst in N. benthamiana but promoted defense gene induction are consistent with the concept that pattern-triggered immunity is split in two separate signaling branches, one leading to ROS production and the other t...|$|E

40|$|Legumes form endosymbiotic {{interaction}} with host compatible rhizobia, {{resulting in the}} development of nitrogen-fixing root nodules. Within symbiotic nodules, rhizobia are intracellularly accommodated in plant-derived membrane compartments, termed symbiosomes. In mature nodule, the massively colonized cells tolerate the existence of rhizobia without manifestation of visible defense responses, indicating the suppression of plant immunity in the nodule in the favur of the symbiotic partner. Medicago truncatula DNF 2 (defective in nitrogen fixation 2) and NAD 1 (nodules with activated defense 1) genes are essential for the control of plant defense during the colonization of the <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>nodule</b> and are required for bacteroid persistence. The previously identified nodule-specific NAD 1 gene encodes a protein of unknown function. Herein, we present the analysis of novel NAD 1 mutant alleles to better understand the function of NAD 1 in the repression of immune responses in symbiotic nodules. By exploiting the advantage of plant double and rhizobial mutants defective in establishing nitrogen-fixing symbiotic interaction, we show that NAD 1 functions following the release of rhizobia from the infection threads and colonization of nodule cells. The suppression of plant defense is self-dependent of the differentiation status of the rhizobia. The corresponding phenotype of nad 1 and dnf 2 mutants and the similarity in the induction of defense-associated genes in both mutants suggest that NAD 1 and DNF 2 operate close together in the same pathway controlling defense responses in symbiotic nodules...|$|E
40|$|Background: Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} indicate that polyploidy occurred by around 54 million years ago, {{early in the}} history of legume evolution, but it has not been known whether this event was confined to the papilionoid subfamily (Papilionoideae; e. g. beans, medics, lupins) or occurred earlier. Determining the timing of the polyploidy event is important for understanding whether polyploidy might have contributed to rapid diversification and radiation of the legumes near the origin of the family; and whether polyploidy might have provided genetic material that enabled the evolution of a novel organ, the <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>nodule.</b> Although symbioses with nitrogen-fixing partners have evolved in several lineages in the rosid I clade, nodules are widespread only in legume taxa, being nearly universal in the papilionoids and in the mimosoid subfamily (e. g., mimosas, acacias) – which diverged from the papilionoid legumes around 58 million years ago, soon after the origin of the legumes. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using transcriptome sequence data from Chamaecrista fasciculata, a nodulating member of the mimosoid clade, we tested whether this species underwent polyploidy within the timeframe of legume diversification. Analysis of gene family branching orders and synonymous-site divergence data from C. fasciculata, Glycine max (soybean), Medicago truncatula, and Vitis vinifera (grape; an outgroup to the rosid taxa) establish that the polyploidy event known from soybean and Medicago occurred after the separation of the mimosoid and papilionoid clades, and at or shortly before the Papilionoideae radiation...|$|E
40|$|Host {{compatible}} rhizobia {{induce the}} formation of legume root nodules, symbiotic organs within which intracellular bacteria are present in plant-derived membrane compartments termed symbiosomes. In Medicago truncatula nodules, the Sinorhizobium microsymbionts undergo an irreversible differentiation process leading {{to the development of}} elongated polyploid noncultivable nitrogen fixing bacteroids that convert atmospheric dinitrogen into ammonia. This terminal differentiation is directed by the host plant and involves hundreds of nodule specific cysteine-rich peptides (NCRs). Except for certain in vitro activities of cationic peptides, the functional roles of individual NCR peptides in planta are not known. In this study, we demonstrate that the inability of M. truncatula dnf 7 mutants to fix nitrogen is due to inactivation of a single NCR peptide, NCR 169. In the absence of NCR 169, bacterial differentiation was impaired and was associated with early senescence of the symbiotic cells. Introduction of the NCR 169 gene into the dnf 7 - 2 /NCR 169 deletion mutant restored symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Replacement of any of the cysteine residues in the NCR 169 peptide with serine rendered it incapable of complementation, demonstrating an absolute requirement for all cysteines in planta. NCR 169 was induced in the cell layers in which bacteroid elongation was most pronounced, and high expression persisted throughout the <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>nodule</b> zone. Our results provide evidence for an essential role of NCR 169 in the differentiation and persistence of nitrogen fixing bacteroids in M. truncatula...|$|E

40|$|The {{root system}} {{architecture}} {{is crucial to}} adapt plant growth to changing soil environmental conditions and consequently to maintain crop yield. In addition to root branching through lateral roots, legumes can develop another organ, the <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>nodule,</b> upon a symbiotic bacterial interaction. A mutant, cra 1, showing compact root architecture was identified in the model legume Medicago truncatula. cra 1 roots were short and thick due to defects in cell elongation, whereas densities of lateral roots and symbiotic nodules were similar to the wild type. Grafting experiments showed that a lengthened life cycle in cra 1 {{was due to the}} smaller root system and not to the pleiotropic shoot phenotypes observed in the mutant. Analysis of the cra 1 transcriptome at a similar early developmental stage revealed few significant changes, mainly related to cell wall metabolism. The most down-regulated gene in the cra 1 mutant encodes a Caffeic Acid O-Methyl Transferase, an enzyme involved in lignin biosynthesis; accordingly, whole lignin content was decreased in cra 1 roots. This correlated with differential accumulation of specific flavonoids and decreased polar auxin transport in cra 1 mutants. Exogenous application of the isoflavone formononetin to wild-type plants mimicked the cra 1 root phenotype, whereas decreasing flavonoid content through silencing chalcone synthases restored the polar auxin transport capacity of the cra 1 mutant. The CRA 1 gene, therefore, may control legume root growth through the regulation of lignin and flavonoid profiles, leading to changes in polar auxin transport...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Bacteroids from {{effective}} nodules of {{subterranean clover}} were ovoid, pear-shaped, or slightly branched and measured 5 - 7 x 4 - 6 p. In the fully developed bacteroid the nuclear material was central, divided into discrete bodies and {{showed signs of}} degeneration. Surrounding the nucleus was a perinuclear region, probably derived from it, and this was surrounded by cytoplasm which contained several mitochondria-like granules. The development of bacteroids from rod-shaped cells is described. Bacteroids from the ineffective nodules studied possessed no perinuclear region, and, in contrast to those from effective nodules, accumulated varying amounts of glycogen, depending {{on the length of}} time for which the bacteroids survived in the host cell.
