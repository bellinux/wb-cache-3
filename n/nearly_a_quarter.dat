5|$|During its {{formative}} stages, the typhoon brought high {{waves to}} Guam, resulting in one death. Twelve families were also left homeless. After passing near Taiwan, Andy brought strong winds, {{which resulted in}} 13deaths. Government offices, schools and airports were closed. At least 60 fishing boats in harbors were badly damaged or wrecked due to strong winds. A total of 300poer poles were brought down; consequently, <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> of Taiwan residents lost power {{at the height of}} the storm. After moving ashore in China, Andy brought heavy rains to nearby Hong Kong.|$|E

The census of 2001 recorded 135people in the Reculver area, <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> of whom were in caravans at the time. The Reculver coastline is within a Site of Special Scientific Interest, a Special Protection Area and a Ramsar site, including most of Reculver Country Park, which itself includes much of Bishopstone Cliffs local nature reserve. While nationally scarce plants and insects are found there, the location is also important for migrating birds and is of significant geological interest.|$|E

60|$|In {{this table}} {{we see that}} {{castings}} which had been ejected {{at the mouth of}} the same burrow, and which in most cases appeared fresh and always retained their vermiform configuration, generally exceeded an ounce in weight after being dried, and sometimes <b>nearly</b> equalled <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> of <b>a</b> pound. On the Nilgiri mountains one casting even exceeded this latter weight. The largest castings in England were found on extremely poor pasture-land; and these, as far as I have seen, are generally larger than those on land producing a rich vegetation. It would appear that worms have to swallow a greater amount of earth on poor than on rich land, in order to obtain sufficient nutriment.|$|R

5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} on December 4, 2004, Boustany defeated Mount, 55 percent to 45 percent in an election with low voter turnout. Democrats had hoped on a big turnout, as the district is <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> African American, a reliable Democratic constituency. Analysis of the race suggested that Mount's defeat was helped by the open primary system that had the Democratic candidates work against each other and led to Cravin's conflict with the state Democratic Party which in turn led to suppressed voter turnout. The large number of negative advertisements was also cited as a factor that contributed to low turnout. Another detriment for Mount mentioned was the strong support for George W. Bush {{in the presidential election}} against John Kerry in the district, which he carried by about 60 percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Alfred died December 4, 1875, {{and left}} Edward with an {{inheritance}} of <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> {{of a million}} dollars. Alfred's death was a blow to Cope; {{his father was a}} constant confidant. The same year marked a suspension of much of Cope's field work and a new emphasis on writing up discoveries of the previous years. His chief publication of the time, The Vertebrata of the Cretaceous Formations of the West, was a collection of 303pages and 54illustration plates. The memoir summarized his experiences prospecting in New Jersey and Kansas. Cope now had the finances to hire multiple teams to search for fossils for him year-round and he advised the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition on their fossil displays. Cope's studies of marine reptiles of Kansas closed in 1876, opening a new focus on terrestrial reptiles. The same year, Cope moved from Haddonfield to 2100 and 2102 Pine Street in Philadelphia. He converted one of the two houses into a museum where he stored his growing collection of fossils. Cope's expeditions took him across Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Montana. His initial journey into the Clarendon beds of Upper Miocene and Lower Pliocene of Texas led to an affiliation with the Geological Survey of Texas. Cope's papers on the region constitute some of his most important paleontological contributions. In 1877, he purchased half the rights to the American Naturalist to publish the papers he produced at a rate so high, Marsh questioned their dating.|$|E

5000|$|On 20 May 1941, Canada was {{formally}} {{requested by the}} United Kingdom to base its new s at St. John's to cover the gap. Canada had accepted responsibility for the defence of Newfoundland early in the war. The position of St. John's moved the forward base of the Canadian escorts <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> full <b>quarter</b> of the way closer to Iceland. This {{was the only way}} shorter-ranged destroyers and smaller escorts could be incorporated into the escort scheme. Changes to the initial corvette design had been made in the United Kingdom, but had yet to be instituted in Canadian construction. This, the lack of essential equipment and lack of training were reasons for the Canadians not to accept the request. However, on 23 May, the first Canadian warships left Halifax, Nova Scotia for St. John's.|$|R

The Cariboo Road saw the transportation of over {{six and a half}} million dollars' worth of gold. Originally Douglas wanted to stretch the road across the continental divide into Rupert's Land (modern day Alberta) but this plan was abandoned when Douglas retired in 1864.|$|R
25|$|Cataracts are a {{major source}} of {{blindness}} in India, with at least 4 million cases reported every year, contributing to <b>nearly</b> to <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> of the world’s blind. Cataract related blindness can be avoided by timely intervention and surgery. In 1970's, India did not have eye care facilities to treat patients on such a large scale. Dr. Venkataswamy, the head of Ophthalmology at Madurai Medical College established the GOVEL Trust in 1976 after his retirement at the age of 58. The first Aravind Eye Hospital was founded in Madurai as a modest 20-bed hospital in a home after most banks refused to lend money citing Dr. V's age and the eccentric model. In this hospital, six beds were reserved for people who could not afford to pay while the remaining five were for paying patients. The hospitals were named after Sri Aurobindo, a freedom fighter and spiritual leader from India. Since the beginning, family members of Dr V have {{played a major role in}} the growth and success of the system.|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{petroleum}} products in Nigeria (especially the PMS and Diesel) {{has been on}} the rise for <b>nearly</b> over <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> of <b>a</b> century ago. It is against this bourgeoning demand that this study investigates the demand for petroleum products in Nigeria. The study employed the Error Correction Model to examine both the short and long dynamics of petroleum in Nigeria. The paper therefore found that price and income elasticity of demand for petroleum product have long run impact on the energy demand in Nigeria. Although, there are short run fluctuations, the impact of the elasticities on energy demand does not exist in the short run. It is however the recommendation of this study that energy policy in Nigeria should be towards providing long term solution to energy problems. Also, policies geared toward diversifying the country’s alternative sources of energy should be formulated and ultimately implemented. It is also the recommendation of this study that the government should restructure and reposition the power sector and other alternative sources of energy so as to reduce the demand pressure on petroleum products which will help foster future growth and energy security in the country...|$|R

The film's governing idea of love is both shallow and dishonest, and its sweet, chipper demeanour masks a sour cynicism about human emotions that is all the more sleazy for remaining unacknowledged. It has the calloused, leering soul of an early-60s rat-pack comedy, but without the suave, seductive bravado." [...] In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers rated it two stars out of a possible four, saying [...] "there are laughs laced with feeling here, but the deft screenwriter Richard Curtis dilutes the impact by tossing in more and more stories. As a director... Curtis can't seem to rein in his writer... He ladles sugar over the eager-to-please Love Actually to make it go down easy, forgetting that sometimes it just makes you gag." ...|$|R
