5|$|Another {{application}} of such chain conditions is in Noetherian induction—also known as well-founded induction—which is a generalization of mathematical induction. It frequently {{is used to}} reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that S is a partially ordered set. One way of proving a statement about the objects of S is to assume {{the existence of a}} counterexample and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the contrapositive of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every <b>non-empty</b> <b>subset</b> of S contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the minimal counterexample. In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counterexample, there is a smaller counterexample.|$|E

25|$|Ideals of a ring R are the submodules of R, i.e., the modules {{contained}} in R.

25|$|In mathematics, a well-order (or well-ordering or well-order relation) {{on a set}} S is a {{total order}} on S with the {{property}} that every <b>non-empty</b> <b>subset</b> of S has a least element in this ordering.

An equivalent definition of a discrete matroid is a matroid in which every proper, <b>non-empty</b> <b>subset</b> of the ground set E is a separator.|$|E
25|$|The well-ordering theorem {{implies that}} the real numbers can be well-ordered if the axiom of choice is assumed: there exists a total order on R with the {{property}} that every <b>non-empty</b> <b>subset</b> of R has a least element in this ordering. (The standard ordering ≤ of the real numbers is not a well-ordering since e.g. an open interval does not contain a least element in this ordering.)

2500|$|Also, {{the various}} {{concepts}} of completeness (not {{to be confused}} with being [...] "total") do not carry over to restrictions. For example, on the set of real numbers a property of the relation [...] "≤" [...] is that every <b>non-empty</b> <b>subset</b> S of R with an upper bound in R has a least upper bound (also called supremum) in R. However, for a set of rational numbers this supremum is not necessarily rational, so the same property does not hold on the restriction of the relation [...] "≤" [...] to the set of rational numbers.|$|E
2500|$|In a well-ordered set, every <b>non-empty</b> <b>subset</b> {{contains}} a distinct smallest element. [...] Given the axiom of dependent choice, this {{is equivalent to}} just saying that the set is totally ordered {{and there is no}} infinite decreasing sequence, something perhaps easier to visualize. In practice, the importance of well-ordering is justified by the possibility of applying transfinite induction, which says, essentially, that any property that passes on from the predecessors of an element to that element itself must be true of all elements (of the given well-ordered set). [...] If the states of a computation (computer program or game) can be well-ordered {{in such a way that}} each step is followed by a [...] "lower" [...] step, then the computation will terminate.|$|E
2500|$|A simple {{counting}} argument will {{verify that}} any non-empty finite {{totally ordered set}} (and hence any <b>non-empty</b> <b>subset</b> thereof) has a least element.

[...] Either by direct proof or by observing that every well order is order isomorphic to an ordinal one may show that every finite total order is order isomorphic to an initial segment of the natural numbers ordered by <. In other words, a total order on a set with k elements induces a bijection with the first k natural numbers. Hence it is common to index finite total orders or well orders with order type omega& by natural numbers in a fashion which respects the ordering (either starting with zero or with one).|$|E

2500|$|Whereas {{the notion}} of {{cardinal}} number {{is associated with a}} set with no particular structure on it, the ordinals are intimately linked with the special kind of sets that are called well-ordered (so intimately linked, in fact, that some mathematicians make no distinction between the two concepts).
