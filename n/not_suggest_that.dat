5|$|Having {{discovered}} the planet, the astronomers worked {{to discover a}} transit event using the Infrared Array Camera of the Spitzer Space Telescope, as ground-based observations could prove difficult if Gliese 3634 b was a rocky planet. While the observations did <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Gliese 3634 b transited its star, a few orbital parameters were discovered, yielding the planet's true mass, which cannot be collected solely by radial velocity measurements.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{remarked that}} here Darwin {{anticipated}} the modern {{concept of an}} ecological niche. He did <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> every favourable variation must be selected, nor that the favoured animals were better or higher, but merely more adapted to their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|According to the Augustan History, Odaenathus {{was assassinated}} by a cousin named Maeonius. In Augustan History, Odaenathus' son {{from his first}} wife was named Herodes and was crowned co-ruler by his father. The Augustan History claims that Zenobia conspired with Maeonius for a time {{because she did not}} accept her stepson as his father's heir (ahead of her own children). The Augustan History does <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Zenobia was {{involved}} in the events leading to her husband's murder, and the crime is attributed to Maeonius' moral degeneration and jealousy. This account, according to historian Alaric Watson, can be dismissed as fictional. Although some modern scholarship suggests that Zenobia was involved in the assassination due to political ambition and opposition to her husband's pro-Roman policy, she continued Odaenathus' policies during her first years on the throne.|$|E

5|$|The {{report on}} the {{disaster}} indicated that it was necessary, with the signals concerned being on the right hand side of the train {{and because of the}} limited visibility from the left hand side of a steam locomotive, for either the fireman to observe those signals (but with the driver being responsible for asking him to do so) or for the driver to cross over the footplate from his left hand driving position to observe them from the other side. In the event, the driver did neither, and neither driver nor fireman looked out for the aspect of the signals. The report ascribed blame to the driver, but recommended that the class be fitted with wider windscreens to improve visibility, noting that, in fog with less than 80 yards' visibility, the three signals involved would not be visible at all from the driver's side of the footplate; however, it noted that, even from a Schools class locomotive with its much smaller boiler, it was unlikely that these signals could be seen from the driver's side in the dense foggy conditions of the incident. The report did <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> poor lifting of smoke obstructed visibility.|$|E

25|$|On 11 August 1999, the {{entertainment}} listings magazine In Dublin was banned {{for six months}} because it was found to 'have been usually or frequently indecent or obscene.' It was investigated after complaints from the public regarding advertisements in the magazine for brothels posing as health studios. However, the Board did <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the magazine's publishers were aware that they were brothels.|$|E
25|$|As {{many of the}} Eastern Aramaic-speaking Assyrians who had {{converted}} to Christianity adopted Biblical (including Jewish) names, most of the early bishops had Eastern Aramaic or Jewish/Biblical names, which does <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> many of the early Christians in this city were converts from Judaism. It served as the seat of a Metropolitan of the Assyrian Church of the East. From the city's Christian period come many church fathers and well-known authors in Syriac.|$|E
25|$|At this time, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} that either surgery or beam radiation has an advantage over the other in this regard, the lower death rates reported with surgery appear to occur because surgery is more likely to be offered to younger men with less serious forms of cancer. Insufficient information is available to determine whether seed radiation extends life more readily than the other treatments, but data so far do <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> it does.|$|E

40|$|Man {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{general-purpose}} computers available and if one designs for man as a moron, one ends up with a system that requires a genius to maintain it.

60|$|I am <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> the non-existence of {{the past}} should be entertained as a serious hypothesis.

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that heterozygote carriers of the Wilson's disease gene mutation may be potentially more susceptible to elevated copper intake than the general population. A heterozygotic frequency of 1/90 people has been estimated in the overall population. However, {{there is no evidence to}} support this speculation. Further, a review of the data on single-allelic autosomal recessive diseases in humans does <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> heterozygote carriers are likely to be adversely affected by their altered genetic status.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of artifacts that are identifiably North Germanic along the coastal areas between the Humber Estuary and East Anglia indicates that Scandinavians migrated to Britain. However, this does <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> {{they arrived at}} the same time as the Angles: they may have arrived almost a century later, and their status and influence upon arrival is uncertain. In particular, regarding a significant Swedish influence in association with the Sutton Hoo ship and a Swedish origin for the East Anglian Wuffinga dynasty, both possibilities are now considered uncertain.|$|E
25|$|A {{study in}} the genetic marker of the Phoenicians led by Pierre Zalloua, showed that the Phoenician genetic marker was found in 1 out of 17 males in the region {{surrounding}} the Mediterranean and Phoenician trading centers such as the Levant, Tunisia, Morocco, Cyprus, and Malta. The study focused on the male Y-chromosome of a sample of 1,330 males from the Mediterranean. Colin Groves, biological anthropologist of the Australian National University in Canberra says that the study does <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the Phoenicians were restricted to a certain place, but that their DNA still lingers 3,000 years later.|$|E

5000|$|To {{highlight}} {{his argument}} that the intrusion into Ortega's office had been a search rather than a property inventory, he used {{the example of the}} book of poetry, which was obviously personal property. [...] "If you pick up a book of poetry you don't have to open that book to find out who sent it to him." [...] It was <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> perhaps he read poetry to his patients, but Klein responded that the state had <b>not</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> and that, even if he did the book was still undeniably personal property.|$|R
25|$|The plaintiffs {{successfully}} {{argued that}} after Congress adopted the Federal Rules of Evidence in 1975, Frye {{was no longer}} the governing standard for admitting scientific evidence in trials held in federal court. The Supreme Court agreed and had already ruled that where common law rules conflicted with provisions of the Rules, the enactment of the Rules had the effect of supplanting the common law. Frye was certainly part of the federal common law of evidence because it was decided almost 50 years before the Rules were enacted. But the text of the Rules did <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Congress intended to keep the Frye rule, and so the Court reasoned that Frye {{was no longer the}} rule.|$|E
25|$|Twin studies, {{adoption}} studies, {{and artificial}} selection {{studies have shown}} that a person's genes can predispose them to developing alcoholism. Evidence from twin studies show that concordance rates for alcoholism are higher for monozygotic twins than dizygotic twins—76% for monozygotic twins and 61% for dizygotic twins. However, female twin studies demonstrate that females have much lower concordance rates than males. Reasons for gender differences may be due to environmental factors, such as negative public attitudes towards female drinkers. Twin studies suggest that males {{are more likely to have}} a genetic predisposition for alcoholism. However, this does <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> a male who does have a genetic predisposition will become an alcoholic. Sometimes the individual may never encounter an environmental trigger that leads to alcoholism.|$|E
25|$|The Vedas {{describes}} {{a number of}} significant Devis such as Ushas (dawn), Prithvi (earth), Aditi (cosmic moral order), Saraswati (river, knowledge), Vāc (sound), Nirṛti (destruction), Ratri (night), Aranyani (forest), and bounty goddesses such as Dinsana, Raka, Puramdhi, Parendi, Bharati, Mahi among others are mentioned in the Rigveda. Sri, also called Lakshmi, appears in late Vedic texts dated to be pre-Buddhist, but verses dedicated to her do <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> her characteristics were fully developed in the Vedic era. All gods and goddesses are distinguished in the Vedic times, but in the post-Vedic texts (~500 BCE to 200 CE), and particularly in the early medieval era literature, they are ultimately seen as aspects or manifestations of one Brahman, the Supreme power.|$|E

25|$|Abfraction {{is another}} type of tooth wear that is {{postulated}} to occur with bruxism, although some still argue whether this type of tooth wear is a reality. Abfraction cavities are said to occur usually on the facial aspect of teeth, in the cervical region as V-shaped defects caused by flexing of the tooth under occlusal forces. It is argued that similar lesions {{can be caused by}} long-term forceful toothbrushing. However, the fact that the cavities are V-shaped does <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the damage is caused by toothbush abrasion, and that some abfraction cavities occur below the level of the gumline, i.e., in an area shielded from toothbrush abrasion, supports the validity of this mechanism of tooth wear. In addition to attrition, erosion is said to synergistically contribute to tooth wear in some bruxists, according to some sources.|$|E
25|$|The book {{refers to}} the book of learning, however, for a {{university}} that sought to implement the Oxbridge traditions of teaching excellence, {{it is important to}} note that the La Trobe book, unlike Oxford, Cambridge, Sydney or Monash, does not contain clasps, which signifies that the book cannot be opened with ease. Its absence does <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the La Trobian approach to learning is any less rigorous, rather, it represents a different approach towards knowledge that can only be seen in conjunction with the other heraldic symbols. That is, that learning and the pursuit of enlightenment is attained through the journey that one undertakes to achieve their desired outcome. Even then, the outcome at which one has reached, may not have been the outcome initially sought. Thus, it is the importance placed on the journey of learning, and what is derived from it, that forms the heart of the university philosophy.|$|E
25|$|The cosmic {{microwave}} background was first predicted in 1948 by Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman. Alpher and Herman were able to estimate {{the temperature of the}} {{cosmic microwave}} background to be 5K, though two years later they re-estimated it at 28K. This high estimate was due to a mis-estimate of the Hubble constant by Alfred Behr, which could not be replicated and was later abandoned for the earlier estimate. Although there were several previous estimates of the temperature of space, these suffered from two flaws. First, they were measurements of the effective temperature of space and did <b>not</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> space was filled with a thermal Planck spectrum. Next, they depend on our being at a special spot {{at the edge of the}} Milky Way galaxy and they did not suggest the radiation is isotropic. The estimates would yield very different predictions if Earth happened to be located elsewhere in the universe.|$|E
30|$|As to {{the second}} part of your question, I have <b>not</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{linguistics}} is insufficient to account for the link. Linguistics is a very broad field now and it has been able to establish links with many other disciplines to explore various aspects of human experience. Cultural Linguistics {{is just one of the}} fields that has a strong root in linguistics.|$|R
30|$|However, we are <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> {{presented}} loose {{approach to}} weak signals and wild cards {{should be applied}} everywhere, or that it could replace more focused and extensive foresight activities in organisations [47].

30|$|Due to tumor {{necrosis}} in most tumors, either treatment-induced or due to tumor heterogeneity, {{only the}} VOIman comprised the entire tumor (including necrosis).

We selected VOIman as reference VOI for pragmatic reasons (as the VOIman encompasses the entire tumor), <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> this approach is best.|$|R
