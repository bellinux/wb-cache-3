5|$|The <b>New</b> <b>Horizons</b> spacecraft, {{en route}} to Pluto and the Kuiper belt, flew by the Jovian system and Io on 28 February 2007. During the encounter, {{numerous}} distant observations of Io were obtained. These included images of a large plume at Tvashtar, providing the first detailed observations of the largest class of Ionian volcanic plume since observations of Pele's plume in 1979. <b>New</b> <b>Horizons</b> also captured images of a volcano near Girru Patera {{in the early stages}} of an eruption, and several volcanic eruptions that have occurred since Galileo.|$|E
5|$|Iridium {{has been}} used in the {{radioisotope}} thermoelectric generators of unmanned spacecraft such as the Voyager, Viking, Pioneer, Cassini, Galileo, and <b>New</b> <b>Horizons.</b> Iridium was chosen to encapsulate the plutonium-238 fuel in the generator because it can withstand the operating temperatures of up to 2000°C and for its great strength.|$|E

5|$|The {{survey work}} {{leading to the}} {{discovery}} of Styx was in preparation for the mission of the unmanned <b>New</b> <b>Horizons</b> spaceprobe, which flew by the Pluto system on 14 July 2015. The discovery of another small Plutonian moon heightened concerns that this region of space may harbor more bodies too small to be detected, and that the probe could be damaged by an uncharted body or ring as it traversed the system at a speed of over 13km/s; tiny moons, such as Saturn's moon Pallene, tend to be associated with tenuous rings or arcs, because their gravity is unable to hold on to material ejected by meteoroid impacts; such diffuse material represents the chief navigational hazard. However, the <b>New</b> <b>Horizons</b> probe did not detect any smaller moons or rings, and passed through the Pluto system safely.|$|E
5|$|These {{characteristics}} make it well-suited for {{electrical power}} generation for devices that must function without direct maintenance for timescales approximating a human lifetime.

5|$|Although {{close to}} Jupiter, <b>New</b> <b>Horizons</b> {{instruments}} made refined {{measurements of the}} orbits of Jupiter's inner moons, particularly Amalthea.

5|$|In 2012, it was {{hypothesized}} that 15810 Arawn could be a quasi-satellite of Pluto, a specific type of co-orbital configuration. According to the hypothesis, the object would be a quasi-satellite of Pluto for about 350,000 years out of every two-million-year period. This hypothesis was disproven in 2016, when more-accurate observations of the position of Arawn were made by <b>New</b> <b>Horizons.</b>|$|E
5|$|In July 2015, {{after nearly}} {{ten years of}} Eris being {{considered}} the ninth-largest object known to directly orbit the sun, close-up imagery from the <b>New</b> <b>Horizons</b> mission more accurately determined Pluto's volume to be slightly larger than Eris's, rather than slightly smaller as previously thought. Eris is now the tenth-largest object known to directly orbit the sun by volume, though not by mass.|$|E

5|$|NASA's ongoing {{investigations}} include in-depth surveys of Mars (Mars 2020 and InSight) and Saturn and {{studies of the}} Earth and the Sun. Other active spacecraft missions are Juno for Jupiter, <b>New</b> <b>Horizons</b> (for Jupiter, Pluto, and beyond), and Dawn for the asteroid belt. NASA continued to support in situ exploration beyond the asteroid belt, including Pioneer and Voyager traverses into the unexplored trans-Pluto region, and Gas Giant orbiters Galileo (1989–2003), Cassini(1997–2017), and Juno (2011–).|$|E
5|$|On March 6, 2015, the Dawn {{spacecraft}} {{began to}} orbit Ceres, {{becoming the first}} spacecraft to orbit a dwarf planet. On July 14, 2015, the <b>New</b> <b>Horizons</b> space probe flew by Pluto and its five moons. Dawn has also explored the former dwarf planet Vesta. Phoebe has been explored by Cassini (most recently) and Voyager 2, which also explored Triton. These three {{are thought to be}} former dwarf planets and therefore their exploration helps {{in the study of the}} evolution of dwarf planets.|$|E
