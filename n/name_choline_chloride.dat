A total of 180 birds, at 6 week-old quail were divided into 18 experimental units, and assigned to a 2 x 3 factorial design experiment with 3 replications (10 birds each) in each treatment. The birds were offered diets containing <b>choline</b> <b>chloride</b> at either 0 (A 1) or 1500 ppm (A 2), with three levels of methionine namely, low (0. 19 %, B 1), standard (0. 79 %, B 2) and, high (1. 05 %, B 3). The feeding trial lasted for 8 weeks. Supplementation of <b>choline</b> <b>chloride</b> in low methionine diet significantly (P< 0. 05) increased egg production, egg mass, and egg weight as compared to those without <b>choline</b> <b>chloride</b> supplementation. Supplementation of <b>choline</b> <b>chloride</b> significantly (P< 0. 05) increased egg yolk weight but decreased albumen and egg shell weight as compared to those fed diets without <b>choline</b> <b>chloride</b> supplementation.
