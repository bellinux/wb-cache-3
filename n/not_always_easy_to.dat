5|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> {{predict a}} grown Appaloosa's color at birth. Foals of any breed {{tend to be}} born with coats that darken when they shed their baby hair. In addition, Appaloosa foals do not always show classic leopard complex characteristics. Patterns {{sometimes}} change {{over the course of}} the horse's life although some, such as the blanket and leopard patterns, tend to be stable. Horses with the varnish roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth, developing more visible spotting as they get older.|$|E

25|$|Milton embraced many heterodox Christian {{theological}} views. He {{rejected the}} Trinity, {{in the belief}} that the Son was subordinate to the Father, a position known as Arianism; and his sympathy or curiosity was probably engaged by Socinianism: in August 1650 he licensed for publication by William Dugard the Racovian Catechism, based on a non-trinitarian creed.

It is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> distinguish Horace's influence during those centuries (the mixing of influences is shown for example in one poet's pseudonym, Horace Juvenal). However a measure of his influence can be found in the diversity of the people interested in his works, both among readers and authors.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} whether B12 deficiency is present, especially within older adults. Patients may present with violent behaviour or more subtle personality changes.

Cognitive symptoms may mimic behaviour in Alzheimer's and other dementias as well. Tests must be run on individuals presenting with such signs to confirm or negate cobalamin deficiency within the blood.|$|E

25|$|The {{t-distribution}} {{is often}} used {{as an alternative to}} the normal distribution as a model for data, which often has heavier tails than the normal distribution allows for; see e.g. Lange et al. The classical approach was to identify outliers and exclude or downweight them in some way. However, it is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> identify outliers (especially in high dimensions), and the t-distribution is a natural choice of model for such data and provides a parametric approach to robust statistics.|$|E
25|$|Behavioral and {{ecological}} separation of tinamou species is evident where their ranges overlap through {{the utilization of}} different food sources and occupation of limited micro-habitats. These micro-habitats are <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> identify, and are highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Some species, such as the red-winged tinamou, utilize multiple habitats such as the open savannas of Amazonia and the dry valleys of the Andes. Similarly, brown tinamous occur in both the Amazon basin and the humid montane forests on the Andean slope.|$|E

25|$|During the 17th and 18th centuries, {{literary}} theorists in Europe {{distinguished between}} {{two types of}} lyric poetry, loosely associated with Horace and Pindar. Regular verses in four line stanzas were associated with Horace's Odes, which did in fact inspire and influence poets of the period. Irregular verses in longer stanzas were termed Pindarics though the association with Pindar was largely fanciful. Abraham Cowley was considered the main exponent of English Pindarics. In fact, the two styles were <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> distinguish and many 'Pindaric' odes were quite Horatian in content, as in some poems by Thomas Gray.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the very}} similar {{processes}} of place name formation in Sinhala and Tamil explicated above, it is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> establish the original language {{of a place}} name, because loan translations are common in both directions. For such an alleged example of loan translation, see the case of Trincomalee above. Additionally, some place names draw on Sanskrit or Pali roots, which are then adapted to Sinhala and Tamil phonology in different ways. These intricacies {{must be taken into}} account when evaluating claims that a certain area was predominantly inhabited by one group or the other at a certain point in time.|$|E
25|$|The {{driving force}} of {{moisture}} movement is chemical potential. However, it is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> relate chemical potential in wood to commonly observable variables, such as temperature and moisture content (Keey et al., 2000). Moisture in wood moves within the wood as liquid or vapour through several types of passageways, based {{on the nature of}} the driving force, (e.g. pressure or moisture gradient), and variations in wood structure (Langrish and Walker, 1993), as explained in the next section on driving forces for moisture movement. These pathways consist of cavities of the vessels, fibres, ray cells, pit chambers and their pit membrane openings, intercellular spaces and transitory cell wall passageways.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, firstly, {{we study}} {{analytically}} the topological {{features of a}} family of hierarchical lattices (HLs) from the view point of complex networks. We derive some basic properties of HLs controlled by a parameter q. Our results show that scale-free networks are <b>not</b> <b>always</b> small-world, and support the conjecture that self-similar scale-free networks are not assortative. Secondly, we define a deterministic family of graphs called small-world hierarchical lattices (SWHLs). Our construction preserves the structure of hierarchical lattices, while the small-world phenomenon arises. Finally, the dynamical processes of intentional attacks and collective synchronization are studied and the comparisons between HLs and Barabási-Albert (BA) networks as well as SWHLs are shown. We show that degree distribution of scale-free networks does not suffice to characterize their synchronizability, and that networks with smaller average path length are <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> synchronize.

25|$|The {{electrodes}} are {{immersed in}} the solution to be titrated and the potential difference between the electrodes is measured. Measured volumes of titrant are added, with thorough (magnetic) stirring, and the corresponding values of emf (electromotive force) or pH recorded. Small increments in volume should be added near the equivalence point which is found graphically by noting the burette reading corresponding to the maximum change of emf or pH per unit change of volume. When {{the slope of the}} curve is more gradual it is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> locate the equivalent point by this method. However, if small increments (0.1nbsp&cm³ or less) of titrant are added near the end point of the titration and a curve of change of emf or pH per unit volume against volume of titrant is plotted, a differential curve is obtained in which the equivalence point is indicated by a peak.|$|E
25|$|Like his {{activities}} before 1113, David's activities and personal whereabouts after 1114 are <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> trace. He {{spent much of}} his time outside his principality. He was, for instance, at St Albans on December 28, 1115, and was still in England in 1116 when he witnessed a charter of his sister Queen Matilda (Edith, or Maud) at Westminster Abbey. Despite the death of his sister on May 1, 1118, David remained a favoured vassal of King Henry. He was at Henry's court in the years 1121 and 1122. He was in the south of England in the summer of 1123, and it is possible that David accompanied Henry to Normandy in the same year to suppress William Clito's claim for the Duchy of Normandy. If David did go to France, then by the time he returned to Britain in 1124 his brother Alexander had died.|$|E
25|$|Black-figure vase {{painting}} in Euboea was {{also influenced by}} Corinth and especially by Attica. It is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> distinguish these works from Attic vases. Scholars assume {{that most of the}} pottery was produced in Eretria. Primarily amphoras, lekythos, hydria and plates were painted. Large-format amphoras were usually decorated with mythological scenes, such as the adventures of Herakles or the Judgment of Paris. The large amphoras, derived from 7th century shapes, have tapering lips and usually scenes relating to weddings. They are apparently funerary vases produced for children who died before they could marry. Restrained employment of incising and regular use of opaque white for the floral ornaments were typical features of black-figure pottery from Eretria. In addition to scenes reflecting Attic models, there were also wilder scenes like the rape of a deer by a satyr or Heracles with centaurs and demons. The vases of the Dolphin Class were previously regarded as being Attic, but are now considered to be Euboic. However, their clay does not match any known Eretrian sources. Perhaps the pieces were produced in Chalcis.|$|E

500|$|Some surnames, like Bird, {{dating from}} 1193 onwards, with {{variants}} like Byrd and Bride, {{are most likely}} nicknames for a birdlike person, though {{they may also be}} metonyms for a birdcatcher; but Birdwood is toponymic, for a person who lived by a wood full of birds. Eagle from 1230 is a nickname from the bird, while Weasel, Wessel from 1193 and Stagg from 1198 are certainly nicknames from those animals. It is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> tell whether a nickname was friendly, humorous or negative, but the surname Stallion, with variants Stallan, Stallen and Stallon, (1202 onwards) is certainly pejorative, meaning [...] "a begetter, a man of lascivious life".|$|E

Factors studied were color codability, verbal cueing, type of question, stimulus silhouettes, and prompting. These factors were included in stimulus scenes for study via two 16 mm motion picture films. Color silhouettes, included in the films, were presented for testing. Subjects responded to color names in one film and to color patches in the other. High and low codable colored stimuli were included with the simple object and geometric shape silhouettes. Half the items asked color questions while the other half asked position questions. Subjects scores were analyzed by a multifactor ANOVA with repeated measures. Results indicated that higher scores were achieved with high codable colored stimuli than with low, color names were <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> remember than color patches, higher scores were achieved with position items than with color items and with simple object stimuli rather than geometric shape stimuli.
