25|$|A {{bloomery}} {{is basically}} an enlarged blacksmith's hearth. It {{consists of a}} pit or chimney with heat-resistant walls made of earth, clay, or stone. (Sandstone was used at Cornwall.) Near the bottom, one or more clay pipes enter through the side walls. These pipes, called tuyeres, allow air to enter the furnace, either by <b>natural</b> <b>draft</b> or by forced with a bellows. An opening {{at the bottom of}} the bloomery may be used to remove the bloom, or the bloomery can be tipped over and the bloom removed from the bottom.|$|E
25|$|The heat {{absorbed by}} the {{circulating}} cooling water in the condenser tubes must also be removed to maintain {{the ability of the}} water to cool as it circulates. This is done by pumping the warm water from the condenser through either <b>natural</b> <b>draft,</b> forced draft or induced draft cooling towers (as seen in the adjacent image) that reduce the temperature of the water by evaporation, by about 11to17°C (20to30°F)—expelling waste heat to the atmosphere. The circulation flow rate of the cooling water in a 500 MW unit is about 14.2 m³/s (500ft³/s or 225,000 US gal/min) at full load.|$|E

50|$|Chimney {{bombs are}} zip-lock bags or other small bags filled with ABC dry {{chemical}} powder. Chimney bombs {{are used by}} fire service personnel to help extinguish chimney fires. Creosote, which is the by-product of the incomplete burning of wood (typically due to chronic combustion-air insufficiency), is extinguished by the chain reaction caused by the chimney bombs. Chimney bombs work by first being dropped directly down a chimney, where upon contact with the flue bottom and heat of the fire, they explode, thereby releasing the powder. Then, the <b>natural</b> chimney <b>draft</b> will carry the dry chemical powder up the shaft of the chimney, thus coating the creosote and eventually neutralizing the fire. Use of multiple chimney bombs may be necessary, depending on how severe the fire is. Chimney bombs can also be effective if they are opened and then dropped down the chimney. In order for chimney bombs to be effective, {{it may be necessary}} to first unclog the chimney.|$|R
2500|$|Common {{applications}} include cooling the {{circulating water}} used in oil refineries, petrochemical and other [...] chemical plants, thermal power stations and HVAC systems for cooling buildings. The classification {{is based on}} the type of air induction into the tower: the main types of cooling towers are <b>natural</b> <b>draft</b> and induced draft cooling towers.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>draft</b> — Utilizes {{buoyancy}} via a tall chimney. [...] Warm, {{moist air}} naturally rises {{due to the}} density differential compared to the dry, cooler outside air. Warm moist air is less dense than drier air at the same pressure. [...] This moist air buoyancy produces an upwards current of air through the tower.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{adjacent}} diagram, water pumped {{from the tower}} basin is the cooling water routed through the process coolers and condensers in an industrial facility. [...] The cool water absorbs heat from the hot process streams which need to be cooled or condensed, and the absorbed heat warms the circulating water (C). The warm water returns {{to the top of}} the cooling tower and trickles downward over the fill material inside the tower. [...] As it trickles down, it contacts ambient air rising up through the tower either by <b>natural</b> <b>draft</b> or by forced draft using large fans in the tower. That contact causes a small amount of the water to be lost as windage/drift (W) and some of the water (E) to evaporate. The heat required to evaporate the water is derived from the water itself, which cools the water back to the original basin water temperature and the water is then ready to recirculate. The evaporated water leaves its dissolved salts behind in the bulk of the water which has not been evaporated, thus raising the salt concentration in the circulating cooling water. To prevent the salt concentration of the water from becoming too high, a portion of the water is drawn off/blown down (D) for disposal. Fresh water make-up (M) is supplied to the tower basin to compensate for the loss of evaporated water, the windage loss water and the draw-off water.|$|E

30|$|Increase in {{the value}} of {{compressive}} load on the draft pad shows that not all mode shapes have decreasing values of frequency, due to geometric non-linearity. Of the five modes, only the first three mode shapes show such behaviour. Mode shapes 4 and 5 show increase in frequency with increase in compressive preload. This behaviour is in contrast to the vibrational behaviour exhibited by the first three modes. Since, material non-linearity is neglected during the analyses, such behaviour can be attributed only to two parameters; either the geometric non-linearity or the high Poisson’s ratio of rubber compound. It can thus be concluded that geometric non-linearity and/or high Poisson’s ratio can cause the <b>natural</b> frequency of <b>draft</b> pads to increase with increasing compressive preload in case of draft pads (which is a elastomeric material).|$|R

40|$|Cookstove {{operation}} comprises {{three basic}} processes, namely combustion of firewood, <b>natural</b> air <b>draft</b> {{due to the}} buoyancy induced by the temperature difference between the hearth and its surroundings, and heat transfer to the pot, stove body and surrounding atmosphere. Owing to the heterogenous and unsteady burning of solid fuel, there exist nonlinear and dynamic interrelationships among these process parameters. A steady-state analytical model of the cookstove operation is developed for its design improvement by splitting the hearth into three zones to study char combustion, volatile combustion and heat transfer to the pot bottom separately. It comprises a total of seven relations corresponding to a thorough analysis of the three basic processes. A novel method is proposed to model the combustion of wood to mimic the realities closely. Combustion space above the fuel bed is split into 1000 discrete parts to study the combustion of volatiles by considering a set of representative volatile gases. Model results are validated by comparing them {{with a set of}} water boiling tests carried on a traditional cookstove in the laboratory. It is found that the major thrust areas to improve the thermal performance are combustion of volatiles and the heat transfer to the pot. It is revealed that the existing design dimensions of the traditional cookstove are close to their optimal values. Addition of twisted-tape inserts in the hearth of the cookstove shows an improvement in the thermal performance due to increase in the heat transfer coefficient to the pot bottom and improved combustion of volatiles...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBurning off is {{the main}} method of carbon deposit removal from coke oven chambers. Optimisation of this {{operation}} {{is of a great}} interest both {{from the point of view}} of current production loss reduction and of coke oven plant lifetime extension. In this study the deposits originating from different parts of chambers have been characterised by chemical analysis, optical microscopy, XRD, Raman spectroscopy and mercury porosimetry. This investigation has shown that deposits contain two carbonaceous phases: the char from pyrolysed carry over coal particles and the pyrolytic carbon from raw gas cracking. Furthermore, the monitoring method for carbon deposits growth in coke oven chamber is presented. The statistical analysis of the visual inspection data has been a useful tool in the evaluation of the rate of deposit growth in individual coke oven chambers. The combustion kinetics of carbon deposits were studied by thermogravimetry under non-isothermal conditions with <b>natural</b> air <b>draft</b> and under isothermal conditions at controlled air flow rate. It was found that the reactivity of carbon deposits is in-between metallurgical coke and electrographite reactivity. At the temperatures below 700 degrees C, under laboratory conditions, the combustion rate (on the basis of external surface) is controlled by surface reaction at higher temperature and activation energy is around is 170 kJ/mol. At temperature higher than 700 degrees C combustion is controlled by gas film diffusion.

40|$|In the United States {{the peak}} {{electrical}} use occurs during the summer. In addition, the building sector consumes {{a major portion}} of the annual electrical energy consumption. One of the main energy consuming components in the building sector is the Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This research studies the feasibility of implementing a solar driven underground cooling system that could contribute to reducing building cooling loads. The developed system consists of an Earth-to-Air Heat Exchanger (EAHE) coupled with a solar chimney that provides a <b>natural</b> cool <b>draft</b> to the test facility building at the Solar Energy Research Test Facility in Omaha, Nebraska. Two sets of tests have been conducted: a natural passively driven airflow test and a forced fan assisted airflow test. The resulting data of the tests has been analyzed to study the thermal performance of the implemented system. Results show that: The underground soil proved to be a good heat sink at a depth of 9. 5 ft, where its temperature fluctuates yearly in the range of (46. 5 °F- 58. 2 °F). Furthermore, the coupled system during the natural airflow modes can provide good thermal comfort conditions that comply with ASHRAE standard 55 - 2004. It provided 0. 63 tons of cooling, which almost covered the building design cooling load (0. 8 tons, extreme condition). On the other hand, although the coupled system during the forced airflow mode could not comply with ASHRAE standard 55 - 2004, it provided 1. 27 tons of cooling which is even more than the building load requirements. Moreover, the underground soil experienced thermal saturation during the forced airflow mode due to the oversized fan, which extracted much more airflow than the EAHE ability for heat dissipation and the underground soil for heat absorption. In conclusion, the coupled system proved to be a feasible cooling system, which could be further improved with a few design recommendations...|$|R
