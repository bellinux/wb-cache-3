In this work, asymmetric supercapacitors with excellent performance have been fabricated using ternary (Ni, Co) 0. 85 Se on carbon fabric as bind-free positive electrode and porous free-standing graphene films as negative electrode. Owing to their metal-like conductivity (~ 1. 67 × 106 S m− 1), significant electrochemical activity, and superhydrophilic nature, our nanostructured ternary <b>nickel</b> cobalt <b>selenides</b> {{result in a}} much higher areal capacitance (2. 33 F cm− 2 at 4 mA cm− 2), better rate performance and cycling stability than their binary selenide equivalents, and other ternary oxides and chalcogenides.

Lead, that was considered {{as a part of the}} composition when it was discovered, found to be in the composition due to the intergrowth of clausthalite PbSe and is not a primary element(Earley, 1950).

40|$|It is {{of prime}} {{importance}} to develop dual-functional electrocatalysts with good activity for overall water splitting, which remains a great challenge.

40|$|Introduction Radioisotopes of bromine are {{of special}} {{interest}} for nuclear medical applications. The positron emitting isotopes 75 Br (T½ = 1. 6 h; β+ = 75. 5 %) and 76 Br (T½ = 16. 2 h; β+ = 57 %) have suitable decay properties for molecular imaging with PET, while the Auger electron emitters 77 Br (T½ = 57. 0 h) and 80 mBr (T½ = 4. 4 h) {{as well as the}} β−-emitter 82 Br (T½ = 35. 3 h) are useful for internal radiotherapy. 77 Br is additionally suited for SPECT. The isotopes 75 Br, 76 Br and 77 Br are usually produced at a cyclotron either by 3 He and α-particle induced reactions on natural arsenic or by proton and deuteron induced reactions on enriched selenium isotopes [1]. As target mate-rials for the latter two reactions, earlier ele-mental selenium [2] and selenides of Cu, Ag, Mn, Mo, Cr, Ti, Pb and Sn were investigated [cf. 3 – 7]. Besides several wet chemical separation techniques the dry distillation of bromine from the irradiated targets was investigated, too [cf. 2, 4, 5]. However, the method needs further development. <b>Nickel</b> <b>selenide</b> was investigated as a promising target to withstand high beam currents, and the dry distillation technique for the isolation of n. c. a. radiobromine from the target was optimized. Material and Methods Crystalline Nickel-(II) selenide (0. 3 – 0. 5 g) was melted into a 0. 5 mm deep cavity of a 1 mm thick Ni plate covered with a Ni grid. NiSe has a melting point of 959 °C. For development of targeting and the chemical separation, natural target material was used. Irradiations of NiSe were usually performed with protons of 17 MeV using a slanting water cooled target holder at the cyclotron BC 1710 [8]. For radiochemical studies a beam current of 3 µA and a beam time of about 1 h were appropriate. To separate the produced no-carrier-added (n. c. a.) radiobromine from the target material a dry distillation method was chosen. The apparatus was developed {{on the basis of a}} dry distillation method for iodine [cf. 9, 10] and optimized to obtain the bromine as n. c. a. [*Br]bromide in a small volume of sodium hydroxide solution. Changing different components of the apparatus, the dead volume could be minimized and an almost constant argon flow as carrier medium was realized. Various capillaries of platinum, stainless steel and quartz glass with different diameters and lengths were tested to trap the radiobromine. Results and Conclusion <b>Nickel</b> <b>selenide</b> proved successful as target material for the production of radiobromine by proton irradiation with 17 MeV protons. The target was tested so far only at beam currents up to 10 µA, but further investigations are ongoing. The optimized dry distillation procedure allows trapping of 80 – 90 % of the produced radiobromine in a capillary. For this purpose quartz glass capillaries proved to be most suitable. After rinsing the capillary with 0. 1 M NaOH solution the activity can be nearly completely obtained in less than 100 µL solution as [*Br]bromide immediately useable for radiosynthesis. So, the overall separation yield was estimated to 81 ± 5 %. The radionuclidic composition and activity of the separated radiobromide was measured by γ-ray spectrometry. Due to the use of natural selenium the determination of the isotopic purity was not meaningful, but it could be shown that the radiobromine was free from other radioisotopes co-produced in the target material and the backing. The radiochemical purity as well as the specific activity were determined by radio ionchromatography. Further experiments using NiSe produced from nickel and enriched selenium are to be per-formed. The isotopic purity of the produced respective radiobromide, the production yield at high beam currents and the reusability of the target material have to be studied...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest on renewable energy sources as substitute to fossil fuels. Among various processes of energy generation, electrochemical methods such as storage and conversion systems, electrolysis of water (production of H 2 and O 2), fuel cells, batteries, supercapacitors and solar cells have received great attention. The core of these energy technologies is a series of electrochemical processes, which directly depend on the nature of ‘electro catalyst’. The design and preparation of an electro catalyst is based on new concepts such as controlled surface roughness, atomic topographic profiles, defined catalytic sites, atomic rearrangements, and phase transitions during electrochemical reactions. Good electro catalysts should possess low over potential, high exchange current density, high stability, low cost and high abundance. The most fundamental reactions in the area of electrochemistry are hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen reduction (ORR) reactions. They are important in different energy systems such as fuel cells and batteries. Platinum has been a favoured electro catalyst due to its high activity, favourable density of states at Fermi level and chemical inertness. The low abundance, however, limits its large scale applications. Alternate materials with high catalytic activities are always required. In this particular direction, metal chalcogenides such as sulphides and selenides have attracted attention in recent years. The present thesis describes the synthesis of different phases of palladium and nickel chalcogenides and their applicability in various electrochemical reactions, both in aqueous and organic media. First part includes the synthesis of highly crystalline palladium selenide phases namely Pd 17 Se 15, Pd 7 Se 4 and Pd 4 Se by employing facile single source molecular precursor method. Pure palladium selenide phases are prepared by thrombolysis of highly processable intermediate complexes formed from metal and selenium precursors. Continuous films of different dimensions on various substrates (glass, ITO, FTO etc.) could be prepared (figure 1). This is one of the requirements for processing any new material. Thickness of the films could be altered by changing the volume of precursor complex coated on the substrate. All the phases are found to be metallic in nature with resistivity values in the range of 30 to 180 µΩ. cm. Figure 1. (a) Scanning electron micrograph and (b) photographic image of Pd 17 Se 15 prepared on different substrates glass (1), Si (2), fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) (3) and DSSC solar cell fabricated using FTO coated Pd 17 Se 15 as the counter electrode (4). Other components of DSSC are given in the experimental section. All the palladium selenides phases are shown to be catalytically active towards electrochemical reactions such as HER and ORR. It is observed that the activities of the phases depend on the stoichiometric ratio of palladium to selenium. Higher the palladium content in the phase, higher is the catalytic activity observed. Therefore, the activities of the chalcogenides can be easily tuned by varying the ratio of metal to chalcogen. Tafel slopes of 50 – 60 mV/decade are observed for all three phases towards HER indicating that Volmer- Heyrovsky mechanism is operative. The exchange current densities are in the range of 2. 3 x 10 - 4 A cm- 2 to 6. 6 x 10 - 6 A cm- 2 (figure 2 a). Figure 2. (a) Linear sweep voltammograms of Pd 17 Se 15, Pd 7 Se 4 and Pd 4 Se in 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 (HER) and (b) 0. 1 M KOH (ORR) at a scan rate of 2 mVs- 1. These phases are found to be highly robust and stable under different pH conditions. Stability of the phases is confirmed by characterizing the catalysts post-HER process, using various techniques such as XPS, XRD and SEM. High activities observed for Pd 4 Se is explained based on electrochemically active surface area values determined from under potential deposition studies and also based on DFT calculations. Computational studies reveal the presence of different charge distribution on palladium in all the three phases which is likely to be another reason for varied activities. Palladium selenides are also explored as catalysts towards ORR in alkaline medium. Kinetic parameters and reaction mechanism are determined using RDE studies. All the three phases are found to be active and Pd 4 Se shows the highest activity, following a direct 4 electron reduction pathway (figure 2 b). Other two phases follow 2 electron pathway terminating at hydrogen peroxide stage. Catalytic activity of Pd 17 Se 15 is further improved by Nano structuring of the material and by synthesizing the material on active supports such as rGO, acetylene black and today carbon. ORR {{plays an important role in}} metal-air batteries. The palladium chalcogenides are used as electrodes in metal-air batteries. Specific energy density observed in the case of Mg-air primary batteries is higher for Pd 4 Se than the other two phases (figure 3 a). Figure 3. (a) Discharge curves of Mg-O 2 battery with different phases of palladium selenides as cathodes. Constant current density of 0. 5 mA cm- 2 is used for discharge. (b) Characteristic J–V curves of DSSCs with Pd 17 Se 15, Pd 7 Se 4 and Pt as counter electrodes. Versatility of these phases is further studied towards redox reaction in non-aqueous medium (I 3 -/I-). This reaction plays a crucial role in the regeneration of the dye in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). Palladium selenide phases prepared on FTO plates are employed as counter electrodes in DSSC. The solar light conversion efficiencies are found to be 7. 45 and 6. 8 % for Pd 17 Se 15 and Pd 7 Se 4 respectively and are comparable to that of platinum (figure 3 b). The reason for high activities may be attributed to high electronic conductivity and low work function of the phases. The following chapter deals with the synthesis of palladium sulphide phases (Pd 4 S and Pd 16 S 7) using both hydrothermal and single source precursor methods. Electro catalytic activities of the phases are shown towards HER and ORR and Pd 4 S exhibits better catalytic activities than that of Pd 16 S 7 phase. Direct electrochemistry of cytochrome c is achieved on Pd 4 S with ∆E of ~ 64 mV (figure 4 a). Electrochemical oxidation of ethanol, ethylene glycol (EG) and glycerol are also studied on the Pd 4 S phase and the activity is found to follow the order, glycerol > ethylene glycol > ethanol (figure 4 b). Figure 4. (a) Cyclic voltammograms of Pd 4 S in (1) 0. 1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7. 0) and (2) in presence of 0. 2 mM cytochrome c at a scan rate of 50 mVs- 1 and (b) Voltammograms of Pd 4 S in presence of different alcohols (ethanol, EG and glycerol) in 1 M KOH solution at sweep rate of 50 mVs- 1. Concentration of alcohols used is 0. 1 M. The effect of dimensionality on the electro catalytic activity of <b>nickel</b> <b>selenide</b> phases forms part of the next chapter. <b>Nickel</b> <b>selenide</b> (NiSe) nanostructures possessing diﬀerent morphologies of wires, spheres and hexagons are synthesized by varying the selenium precursors namely, selenourea, selenium dioxide (SeO 2) and potassium selenocyanate (KSeCN), respectively using hydrothermal method. The diﬀerent selenium precursors result in morphologies that are probably dictated by the by-products as well as relative rates of amorphous selenium formation and dissolution. The three diﬀerent morphologies are used as catalysts for HER, ORR and glucose oxidation reactions. The wire morphology is found to be better than that of spheres and hexagons for all the reactions. Among the reactions studied, NiSe is found to be good for HER and glucose oxidation while ORR seems to terminate at the peroxide stage. In alkaline medium, nickel forms hydroxides and oxy-hydroxides and these oxyhydroxides are catalytically active towards the oxidation of glucose. Therefore, nickel	selenides	are	employed	as	highly selective	non-enzymatic	glucose	sensors	and detection limit of 5 µM is observed. Electrical measurements on a single nanowire and a hexagon morphology of NiSe are carried out on devices fabricated by focused ion beam (FIB) technique (figure 5). The semiconducting nature of NiSe is revealed in the I-v measurements. The band gap of the material is found to be 1. 9 eV and hence the single nanowire and hexagon are shown to act as visible light photodetector. Figure 5. SEM images of (a) single NiSe nanowire and (b) single NiSe hexagon with Pt contacts fabricated by FIB technique. Figure 6. Cyclic voltammograms of NiSe nanowires in 0. 5 M aqueous NaOH in the (i) absence and (ii) the presence of 0. 5 mM glucose, at a scan rate of 20 mVs- 1 and (b) Galvanostatic discharge performance of Ni 3 Se 2 with different morphologies (A, B and C represent Ni 3 Se 2 prepared from SeO 2, selenourea and KSeCN respectively). The next chapter includes the synthesis of different morphologies of Ni 3 Se 2 using three different selenium precursors (SeO 2, KSeCN and selenourea) and the study of their activities towards electrochemical reactions such as HER and glucose oxidation (figure 6 a). Electrical measurements demonstrated the metallic behaviour of the material. These are also shown to be efficient electrode materials in energy storage devices such as supercapacitors with high specific capacitance of 2200 F/g (figure 6 b). The studies are summarized in the last chapter with scope for further work. The appendixes show preliminary studies on electrooxidation of glycerol and propanol on Pd supported on TiN, synthesis of other selenides of Ni, Cu, Ag and Ti, and electro synthesis of metal-organic frameworks.
