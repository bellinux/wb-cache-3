40|$|Objectives: The {{bi-directional}} cavopulmonary anastomosis {{forms an}} essential staging procedure for univentricular hearts. This review aims to identify {{risk factors for}} morbidity, mortality, and suitability for Fontan completion. Methods: A total of 114 patients undergoing cavopulmonary anastomosis between 1992 and 2012 were reviewed to assess primary - mortality and survival to Fontan completion - and secondary outcome endpoints - re-intubation, <b>new</b> <b>drain,</b> and ICU stay. Median age and weight were 8 months and 6. 9 kg, respectively. In 83 % of patients, 1 - 3 interventions had preceded. Norwood-type procedures became more prevalent over time. Results: Extubation occurred after a median of 4 hours, median ICU stay was 2 days; 10 patients (8. 8 %) needed re-intubation and 18 received a <b>new</b> <b>drain.</b> Higher central venous pressure and transpulmonary gradient were risk factors for <b>new</b> <b>drain</b> insertion (p< 0. 01). Higher pre-operative pulmonary pressure correlated with increased inotropic support and prolonged intubation (p= 0. 01). Need for re-intubation was significantly affected by younger age at operation (p= 0. 01). Hospital and pre-Fontan mortality were 11. 4 and 5. 3 %, respectively. Operative mortality was independently affected by younger age (p= 0. 013), lower weight (p= 0. 02), longer bypass time (p= 0. 04), and re-intubation (p= 0. 004). Interstage mortality was mainly influenced by moderate ventricular function (p= 0. 03); 82 % of survivors underwent or are candidates for Fontan completion. Conclusion: The cavopulmonary anastomosis remains associated with adverse outcomes. Age at operation decreases with rising prevalence of complex univentricular hearts. Considering the important impact of re-intubation on hospital mortality, peri-operative management should focus on optimising cardio-respiratory status. Once this selection step is taken, successful Fontan completion can be expected, provided that ventricular function is maintained...|$|R

25|$|A major {{development}} {{began in}} 1764, when {{a body of}} people called Holderness Drainage obtained an Act of Parliament which excluded land {{to the east of}} the River Hull from the jurisdiction of the Court of Sewers. They employed the engineers John Smeaton and John Grundy, Jr. to advise on a scheme for the Holderness level, and the main Holderness Drain was completed by October 1767. Work continued on building banks and drains until 1772, by which time the works had cost £24,000. The success of the scheme resulted in several areas {{to the west of the}} river attempting to improve drainage. Cottingham was the first, obtaining an Act of Parliament in 1766 which allowed them to enclose the land and cut a <b>new</b> <b>drain</b> to join the Hull at Stoneferry. The Beverley and Skidby Drainage Act of 1785 was obtained to improve an area below Beverley by cutting a <b>new</b> <b>drain</b> which carried the water to a point further down the Hull. The area had previously been drained to a sluice called Wharton's clow at Cottingham since 1747. Flooding in these two areas had never been as serious as that in the carrs further to the north, and in 1796, the landowners started to consider how this might be remedied.|$|R

50|$|The {{hydrology}} of {{the region}} was altered in 1802 {{with the opening of}} the Stainforth and Keadby Canal, which cut across Hatfield Chase in an east-west direction, with Thorne Moors to the north and Hatfield Moors to the south. Much of the Thorne boating dike was destroyed, and <b>new</b> <b>drains</b> were cut parallel to the canal. A new 2 mi navigable drain was sanctioned by the Hatfield, Thorne and Fishlake Enclosure Commissioners, which ran along the southern section of Thorne Moors. There were then some 6 mi of navigable drains, on which clinker-built boats operated. They were 28 by 6 ft, and were symmetrical in shape, allowing them to be worked in either direction without having to turn them. Coal brought into the region by the Stainforth and Keadby Canal led to a fall in the demand for peat as a fuel. The number of boats operating on the peat canals had declined to 8 or 9 by the 1820s, and such traffic ceased altogether around 1830. Peat for export from the moors was taken to the Stainforth and Keadby Canal by cart.|$|E
40|$|Subsurface {{drainage}} is {{an essential}} water management practice that is {{partly responsible for the}} legendary agricultural productivity of the "corn-belt" region in the United States. Recent researches indicate that the conventional drainage practice has contributed {{a large percentage of the}} surface water pollution by agricultural chemicals while the managed drainage practice can address the environmental concerns as well as the needs for crop yields. The fully-coupled physically-based hydrology models are important tools for evaluating these environmental issues and agroeconomic benefits by considering the subsurface drainage practices into the integrated surface and subsurface flow environment at the agricultural fields. Our research on the applications of the integrated hydrology model HydroGeoSphere to the real tile-drained farmlands in Indiana and Illinois yields a <b>new</b> tile <b>drain</b> module that can simulate both the conventional and managed drainage practices.

The <b>new</b> tile <b>drain</b> module is verified with both hypothetical examples and laboratory experiments.

50|$|The PCI's {{municipal}} showcase was Bologna, {{which was}} held continuously by the PCI from 1945 onwards. Amongst other measures, the local PCI administration tackled urban problems with successful programmes of health for the elderly, nursery education, and traffic reform, while also undertaking initiatives in housing and school meal provisions. From 1946 to 1956, the Communist city council built 31 nursery schools, 896 flats, and 9 schools. Health care improved substantially, street lighting was installed, <b>new</b> <b>drains</b> and municipal launderettes were built, and 8,000 children received subsidised school meals. In 1972, the then-mayor of Bologna, Renato Zangheri, introduced a new and innovative traffic plan with strict limitations for private vehicles and a renewed concentration on cheap public transport. Bologna's social services continued to expand throughout the early and mid-Seventies. The city centre was restored, centres for the mentally sick were instituted {{to help those who}} had been released from recently closed psychiatric hospitals, handicapped persons were offered training and found suitable jobs, afternoon activities for schoolchildren were made less mindless than the traditional doposcuola (after-school activities), and school programming for the whole day helped working parents.

40|$|Abstract: Unsealed {{roads are}} {{necessary}} infrastructure required to manage forested catchments. They form linear {{features in the}} landscape that intersect, concentrate and redirect flow paths which can alter catchment hydrology and in-stream water quality. However, water quality is only affected if runoff and sediment generated on the roads are delivered to the streams. Road runoff and eroded sediment can enter the stream at 1) stream crossings, 2) via gullies at drain outlets that concentrate the flow {{all or part of}} the way to the stream, or 3) via diffuse overland flow. Hairsine et al. (2002) developed a simple probabilistic model for diffuse overland flow. It uses the concept of the ‘volume to breakthrough’, which is the volume of runoff required to enter an area before discharge is observed at the downslope boundary of that area. The model only requires variables of distance of drain outlet from the stream, road contributing area (or road length), road infiltration rate and a designer rainfall event to calculate runoff volume. The model has been applied to a number of forest catchments to assess the adequacy of road drainage. Where road drainage is determined to be inadequate, the model can be used to determine the location of “new drains ” by maximizing contributing road area as determined by the distance the drain outlet is from the stream. However, this method results in many <b>new</b> <b>drains</b> being placed close to existing drains along road segments. The aim of this paper is to describe a new model that optimizes the placement of <b>new</b> <b>drains</b> along unseale...|$|E

40|$|Mathematical {{analyses}} {{were used to}} develop a stochastic model that predicts the influence of some hydraulic and hydrologic parameters on the perennial flooding of {{some parts of the}} Calabar Metropolis. The model was developed based on rainfall data, cross sectional area of drains, artificial drainage density, degree imperviousness and the gradient (slope). Incorrect sizing and spread of drains as well as the existing slopes employed in the generation of the drains’ invert during construction have been seen as some of the key factors that foster flooding in the Metropolis. Malalignment of the drains with the existing outlet does not help the expected discharge of storm runoff to receiving bodies, nor is the density of the existing drains adequate to accommodate the storm runoff generated in the Metropolis. Sequel to these, revisiting the Calabar Master Plan of 1972 with the original design for six drainage outlets is recommended. In addition, since urbanization is taking a new dimension in the Metropolis, injecting <b>new</b> <b>drains</b> to improve the artificial drainage density as well as legislating against construction along the right-of –way of storm runoff {{will go a long way}} in curbing the menace of flooding within the Metropolis...|$|E
40|$|The {{stabilisation}} of the Plavinas dam, Latvia was {{the subject}} of this final thesis. The objective was to investigate the weaknesses of the Plavinas dam and to present possible stabilising treatments. This includes a rough estimate on costs and construction methods. Plavinas hydroelectric power station is the most important dam in Latvia, supplying 30 % of the countrys power. The Plavinas blocks the runoff of the Daugava River, resulting in the formation of a reservoir. The power plant is a composite type structure consisting of a concrete power house and a spillway, which is located on top of the power house. The water from the reservoir can either flow through ten generating units located in the concrete power house, which is approximately 200 m long, or flow over the power house, the spillway. The head difference between the reservoir and the tailrace measures 40 m. Several kilometres of hydraulically filled embankment dams extend to both sides of the concrete power house. The dam is founded on glacial till overlying a sandstone layer. Drainage wells were incorporated in the foundation of the power house. This drainage system reduces the large uplift water pressures from the head difference between the reservoir level and the tailrace. This results in a larger effective weight of the structure, which is favourable for the bearing capacity of the structure against sliding and toppling. There are indications that the drainage wells, which can not be replaced under the concrete structure, do not function according to specifications: an increase of uplift water pressures is monitored. This could endanger the stability of the power house. transport of fine soil particles with the groundwater flow in the regional aquifer is occurring towards the drainage galleries near the right embankment as well as the drainage system underneath the structure. settlements of the power house have been observed, which seems to be caused by collapsing seepage channels. The power house structure and the aprons were schematised and the normative loading cases were determined. The stability of the structure was calculated for the following situations: original design assumptions in which the uplift water pressure is reduced by approximately 90 % rising water pressures due to continuously less effective original drainage system complete failure of drainage wells without compensating treatments different treatments, increasing the stability of the power house in case the original drainage fails entirely, either by adding more weight to compensate for the larger uplift water pressure or by reducing the uplift pressure by an extension of the seepage path or <b>new</b> <b>drains.</b> The different stabilising treatments were analysed in a multi criteria analysis taking into account amongst others the problem elimination, durability and feasibility of execution.
