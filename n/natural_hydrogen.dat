25|$|Hydrogen isotope {{biogeochemistry}} is {{the scientific}} study of biological, geological, and chemical processes in the environment using the distribution and relative abundance of hydrogen isotopes. There are two stable isotopes of hydrogen, protium 1H and deuterium 2H, which vary in relative abundance on the order of hundreds of permil. The ratio between these two species can be considered the hydrogen isotopic fingerprint of a substance. Understanding isotopic fingerprints and the sources of fractionation that lead to variation between them can be applied to address a diverse array of questions ranging from ecology and hydrology to geochemistry and paleoclimate reconstructions. Since specialized techniques are required to measure <b>natural</b> <b>hydrogen</b> isotope abundance ratios, the field of hydrogen isotope biogeochemistry provides uniquely specialized tools to more traditional fields like ecology and geochemistry.|$|E

50|$|Dimethyl sulfate, {{known as}} DMS, is a {{chemical}} {{that can be}} used to modify nucleic acids in order to determine secondary structure. DMS modifies certain bases through methylation. One set of methylation products that is used for RNA is the methylation of N1 adenosine and N3 of cytosine which prevents the <b>natural</b> <b>hydrogen</b> bonds to form between bases modified by DMS. This enables modification sites to be detected by RT-PCR, as modified sites cannot be basepaired, which results in the reverse transcriptase to fall off and produce different band sizes. DMS may modify adenines and cytosines that are single stranded, base paired at the end of a helix, or in a base pair next to a GU pair. Detection of these modifications is done by examination of a gel and looking at bands present. One thing of note is that since modification prevents the addition of nucleotides at the modification site each of the bands generated is shifted by one base down on the gel. Nucleotides may be protected from DMS modification by base pairing, tertiary contacts, or protein-RNA interactions. This can be used to begin to develop a model of secondary structure for the RNA molecule. Structure probing by DMS allows for detection of secondary structure changes due to binding of RNA molecules along with detecting changes in tertiary structure.|$|E

Due to the natural gas price dependency of the international oil price the hydrogen cost level that is required for competitiveness of hydrogen and fuel cell technology depends on the oil price. This gives rise to the question: At which oil price will <b>natural</b> gas based <b>hydrogen</b> and advanced hydrogen be competitive? The question is addressed by developing a model that links hydrogen and conventional fuels to the oil price and to related fuel efficiencies.
