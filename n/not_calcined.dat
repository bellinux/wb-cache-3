40|$|Urban composts {{represent}} a significant reservoir of nutrients, particularly phosphorus (P). Their application in agriculture requires {{more information on}} {{their impact on the}} dynamics of soil P. In this study, the long-term effects of repeated applications of urban composts and manure on the dynamics of organic P (orgP-SW) and inorganic P (inorgP-SW) stocks using the Saunders and Williams’ (SW) method were analyzed in the soil of the Qualiagro field experiment (4 blocks), grown in a corn / wheat succession. Five treatments were studied: a control without P (CONTROL), a cattle manure (MANURE) and 3 urban composts: compost green waste + sludge (DVB), a biowaste (BIO) and residual household waste (OMR). They were added to soils on the basis of 4 t C / ha every two years over a period of 15 years. We determined the orgP-SW content in the applied products and the plough layer by difference between P extracted by sulfuric acid (0. 1 M) in a calcined sample (totP-SW) and <b>not</b> <b>calcined</b> (inorgP-SW) samples. All products mainly contained inorgP-SW (81 %) because orgP-SW averaged 19 % for the 3 urban composts and manure. The average orgP-SW soil content in 2013 was 31 % of Ptot-SW and did not differ among treatments. After 15 years, cumulated balance of added minus exported P varied between - 351 (± 12) kg P ha- 1 in CONTROL and + 1292 (± 21) kg P ha- 1 in the DVB treatment. Despite these differences, the stock of total organic P was invariant across most treatments but in the manure treatment where it was higher. Variations in inorgP-SW and total P stocks reflected differences in P balances. The stability of soil orgP-SW in CONTROL indicated that soil organic P contributed little or not at all to crop phosphate nutrition...|$|E
40|$|Calcium looping is a Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) {{technology}} {{which has}} the potential to be applied to both power generation plants and some industrial emission sources. The main problem with the use of calcium oxide-based sorbents is their characteristic decay in carrying capacity. This is caused by sintering and is made worse during multiple cycles of CO 2 absorption (carbonation) and release (calcination). This paper provides an investigation into the degradation of a novel type of sorbent that is able to regenerate porosity during the temperature cycling of calcium looping. The porosity regeneration of this sorbent is a result of a dicalcium silicate additive undergoing a reliable phase change (α′ ↔ β), which consequently has a useful volume change associated with it. The sorbent here, has been tested for the first time under reasonably realistic conditions within a TGA for multiple cycles. The results demonstrated that the sorbent displays the characteristic decline in carrying capacity when calcined in the presence of CO 2, but <b>not</b> when <b>calcined</b> in the absence of CO 2 in the fluidising gas. This paper also presents an improved method to conduct TGA carrying capacity measurements of CO 2 sorbents which minimises the over carbonation between cycles...|$|R

40|$|The {{properties}} of dried (but <b>not</b> <b>calcined)</b> coprecipitated nickel ceria {{systems have been}} investigated {{in terms of their}} hydrogen emission characteristics following activation in hydrogen. XRD and BET data obtained on the powders show similarities to calcined ceria but {{it is likely that the}} majority of the material produced by the coprecipitation process is largely of an amorphous nature. XPS data indicate very little nickel is present on the outermost surface of the particles. Nevertheless, the thermal analytical techniques (TGA, DSC and TPD-MS) indicate that the hydrogen has access to the catalyst present and the nickel is able to generate hydrogen species capable of interacting with the support. Both unactivated and activated materials show two hydrogen emission features, viz. low temperature and high temperature emissions (LTE and HTE, respectively) over the temperature range 50 and 500 °C. A clear effect of hydrogen interaction with the material is that the activated sample not only emits much more hydrogen than the corresponding unactivated one but also at lower temperatures. H 2 dissociation occurs on the reduced catalyst surface and the spillover mechanism transfers this active hydrogen into the ceria, possibly via the formation and migration of OH− species. The amount of hydrogen obtained (0. 24 wt%) is 10 × higher than those observed for calcined materials and would suggest that the amorphous phase plays a critical role in this process. The affiliated emissions of CO and CO 2 with that of the HTE hydrogen (and consumption of water) strongly suggests a proportion of the hydrogen emission at this point arises from the water gas shift type reaction. It has not been possible from the present data to delineate between the various hydrogen storage mechanisms reported for ceria...|$|E
40|$|Selenium {{modified}} ruthenium electrocatalysts {{supported on}} carbon black were synthesized using NaBH 4 {{reduction of the}} metal precursor. Prepared Ru/C electrocatalysts showed high dispersion and very small averaged particle size. These Ru/C electrocatalysts were subsequently modified with Se following two procedures: (a) preformed Ru/carbon catalyst was mixed with SeO 2 in xylene and reduced in H 2 and (b) Ru metal precursor was mixed with SeO 2 followed by reduction with NaBH 4. The XRD patterns indicate that a pyrite-type structure was obtained at higher annealing temperatures, regardless of the Ru:Se molar ratio used in the preparation step. A pyrite-type structure also emerged in samples that were not calcined; however, in this case, the pyrite-type structure was only prominent for samples with higher Ru:Se ratios. The characterization of the RuSe/C electrocatalysts suggested that the Se in noncalcined samples was present mainly as an amorphous skin. Preliminary study of activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) using electrocatalysts with a Ru:Se ratio of 1 : 0. 7 indicated that annealing after modification with Se had a detrimental effect on their activity. This result {{could be related to}} the increased particle size of crystalline RuSe 2 in heat-treated samples. Higher activity of not annealed RuSe/C catalysts could also be a result of the structure containing amorphous Se skin on the Ru crystal. The electrode obtained using <b>not</b> <b>calcined</b> RuSe showed a very promising performance with a slightly lower activity and higher overpotential in comparison with a commercial Pt/C electrode. Single wall carbon nanohorns (SWNH) were considered for application as ORR electrocatalysts' supports.

40|$|One of the {{materials}} that is currently highlighted are the compounds of niobium, because they have features like acidity, oxidative and photocatalytic properties and for {{being one of the}} most abundant metals in the country, Brazil is the world's largest producer. In this scenario, the work has to evaluate the efficiency of heterogeneous photocatalysis niobium materials in the oxidation of methanol and the inactivation of Escherichia coli using immobilization systems ―coating” and suspension. Commercial niobium oxide (Nb 2 O 5) was evaluated in suspension and immobilization in different systems (tubes and rings) for photocatalytic processes for water treatment (methanol oxidation and inactivation of Escherichia coli). From the results of the commercial Nb 2 O 5 characterizations was observed the presence of an amorphous structure with heat thermal treatment at temperatures above 550 °C becomes crystalline phases, however, this fact produce a significant aggregation of the particles which reduced the specific area and the photocatalytic activity. The <b>not</b> <b>calcined</b> Nb 2 O 5 material showed a higher activity, for both oxidation of methanol as for the inactivation of bacterial tests, the latter being very sensitive to the chemical composition water. Immobilization of the photocatalyst reactor walls prevents the need for removal of Nb 2 O 5 particles after treatment, but significantly reduction its activity. In contrast, immobilization in a fixed-bed (rings) led to a moderate reduction in activity, which is counteracted by improvement in the long-term stability of the material. Niobium catalysts were synthesized using a refluxing method with and without the use of NaOH in different conditions of synthesis and characterized by different techniques in order to verify the phase formation of niobium. From the results of X-ray diffraction for the synthesized materials were recorded forming of species niobium oxide and sodium niobates depending on the adopted synthesis methodology. The catalytic activity of these materials was evaluated in the oxidation of methanol in relation to the amount of catalyst in which the activities have different behaviors have been dependent on the structure, surface and morphological parameters. Materials with sodium niobate structure have a lineal tendency of activity in relation to the mass of catalysts, while {{the materials}} niobium oxide structure have an abrupt loss of their catalytic activity at higher catalyst concentrations, indicating that the dispersion of the light is higher in these catalysts as increases the amount of particles in suspension. Among the materials synthesized and analyzed in the oxidation of methanol, which was more efficient, was the material of sodium niobate NaNbO 3 to their textural properties, optical, which is a promising material for photocatalysis. Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) Um dos materiais que atualmente está em destaque são os compostos de nióbio, por apresentarem características como acidez, propriedades oxidativas e fotocatalíticas e por ser um dos metais mais abundantes do país, sendo o Brasil o maior produtor mundial. Este trabalho avaliou a eficiência da fotocatálise heterogênea de materiais de nióbio na oxidação de metanol e na inativação do microrganismo Escherichia Coli. Foram sintetizados catalisadores a base de nióbio Nb 2 O 5 e foram feitas imobilizações (coating) utilizando óxido de nióbio. Diante das caracterizações, foi possível verificar a formação de espécies de óxido de nióbio e niobatos de sódio dependendo da metodologia de síntese adotada. Esses materiais foram avaliados na oxidação de metanol em diferentes concentrações de catalisadores e apresentaram uma eficiência na formação do formaldeído proveniente da oxidação, esta eficiência está diretamente relacionada com a concentração dos catalisadores, sendo o material de niobato de sódio o que apresentou maior eficiência, devido as suas propriedades texturais, ópticas, sendo este um material promissor no ramo da fotocatálise. Para os sistemas de imobilização (coating), verificou-se que o revestimento ideal é obtido com três imobilizações, estes materiais foram analisados na oxidação de metanol e na inativação de microrganismo Escherichia Coli.

40|$|It is {{of utmost}} {{importance}} that the white liquor used in the digester of a sulphate pulp mill is of high quality. The white liquor is prepared in the causticizing plant, through causticizing of the sodium carbonate in the green liquor. The causticizing is made with slaked lime, which, in turn, has been calcined in the lime mud reburning plant and slaked in the green liquor. To enable high quality white liquor to be produced the lime has to be of high quality. A high quality lime is reactive in the slaking and causticizing and the later-formed lime mud has to be easily separated from the white liquor. This study {{has shown that the}} quality of the lime is closely correlated to the specific surface area of the lime. Lime calcined in different types of equipment was slaked and causticized in laboratory scale equipment. The specific filtration resistance of the later-formed lime mud was then determined. Reburned lime mud from a rotary kiln, a pilot scale fluidised bed and from a laboratory oven were all more reactive when the specific surface area of the lime was large. However, the later-formed lime mud was more easily separated from the white liquor if the lime had a small surface area. Since the size of the specific surface area of the lime is extremely important, the effects of various reburning conditions on the surface area were more closely examined. Experiments in a laboratory oven showed that the specific surface area of the lime is decreased by an increased temperature or increased residence time in the oven. Limes that were <b>not</b> completely <b>calcined</b> had a specific surface area between that of the parent and the calcined material. Furthermore, experiments in an atmosphere of pure carbon dioxide, at non-calcining temperatures, showed considerable sintering of lime mud before calcination. This is important since the characteristics of the parent material is of importance to the final product. Calcium carbonate pro analysi used as a reference, had ten times larger specific surface area. This is likely the effect of less impurities and of the different structure of the parent material. Lime mud and calcium carbonate were calcined in pure nitrogen in a quartz glass reactor. These experiments showed the largest reported specific surface area of calcined lime mud, 9. 2 m 2 /g, when treated for 300 s at 700 °C. The specific surface area of calcium carbonate p. a. calcined in the quartz glass reactor was about ten times larger than that of the lime mud. The decrease in specific surface area with time was found to follow the German and Munir equation. The temperature dependence was empirically estimated and included in the German-Munir equation. The. gamma. value, 3, indicates solid phase diffusion as the mechanism of sintering. The lowest specific surface area was obtained for lime produced in a rotary kiln, 0. 2 m 2 /g. The lime from the pilot scale fluidised bed was more soft-burned and had a specific surface area that was ten times larger, 2 m 2 /g. This is presumably due to the good mixing in the fluidised bed reactor, which enables high heat and mass transfer in the reactor. Accordingly, the temperature and the concentration of carbon dioxide is kept at a low level. The largest surface area obtained in this study was that of calcium carbonate p. a. calcined in pure nitrogen, 99 m 2 /g...|$|R
40|$|This project led to {{the further}} {{development}} of a combined catalyst and sorbent for improving the process technology required for converting CH{sub 4 } and/or CO into H{sub 2 } while simultaneously separating the CO{sub 2 } byproduct all in a single step. The new material {{is in the form}} of core-in-shell pellets such that each pellet consists of a CaO core surrounded by an alumina-based shell capable of supporting a Ni catalyst. The Ni is capable of catalyzing the reactions of steam with CH{sub 4 } or CO to produce H{sub 2 } and CO{sub 2 }, whereas the CaO is capable of absorbing the CO{sub 2 } as it is produced. The absorption of CO{sub 2 } eliminates the reaction inhibiting effects of CO{sub 2 } and provides a means for recovering the CO{sub 2 } in a useful form. The present work showed that the lifecycle performance of the sorbent can be improved either by incorporating a specific amount of MgO in the material or by calcining CaO derived from limestone at 1100 C for an extended period. It also showed how to prepare a strong shell material with a large surface area required for supporting an active Ni catalyst. The method combines graded particles of {alpha}-alumina with noncrystalline alumina having a large specific surface area together with a strength promoting additive followed by controlled calcination. Two different additives produced good results: 3 {micro}m limestone and lanthanum nitrate which were converted to their respective oxides upon calcination. The oxides partially reacted with the alumina to form aluminates which probably accounted for the strength enhancing properties of the additives. The use of lanthanum made it possible to calcine the shell material at a lower temperature, which was less detrimental to the surface area, but still capable of producing a strong shell. Core-in-shell pellets made with the improved shell materials and impregnated with a Ni catalyst were used for steam reforming CH{sub 4 } at different temperatures and pressures. Under all conditions tested, the CH{sub 4 } conversion was large (> 80 %) and nearly equal to the predicted thermodynamic equilibrium level as long as CO{sub 2 } was being rapidly absorbed. Similar results were obtained with both shell material additives. Limited lifecycle tests of the pellets also produced similar results that were not affected by the choice of additive. However, during each lifecycle test the period during which CO{sub 2 } was rapidly absorbed declined from cycle to cycle which directly affected the corresponding period when CH{sub 4 } was reformed rapidly. Therefore, the results showed a continuing need for improving the lifecycle performance of the sorbent. Core-in-shell pellets with the improved shell materials were also utilized for conducting the water gas shift reaction in a single step. Three different catalyst formulations were tested. The best results were achieved with a Ni catalyst, which proved capable of catalyzing the reaction whether CO{sub 2 } was being absorbed or <b>not.</b> The <b>calcined</b> alumina shell material by itself also proved to be a very good catalyst for the reaction as long as CO{sub 2 } was being fully absorbed by the core material. However, neither the alumina nor a third formulation containing Fe{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } were good catalysts for the reaction when CO{sub 2 } was not absorbed by the core material. Furthermore, the Fe{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }-containing catalyst was not as good as the other two catalysts when CO{sub 2 } was being absorbed...|$|R
