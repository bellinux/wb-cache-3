25|$|JPL was {{transferred}} to NASA in December 1958, becoming the agency's primary planetary spacecraft center. JPL engineers designed and operated Ranger and Surveyor missions to the Moon that prepared {{the way for the}} Apollo program. JPL also led the way in interplanetary exploration with the Mariner missions to Venus, Mars, and Mercury. In 1998, JPL opened the <b>Near-Earth</b> <b>Object</b> Program Office for NASA; as of 2013, it has found 95% of asteroids that are a kilometer or more in diameter that cross Earth's orbit.|$|E
25|$|Launching {{materials}} from Earth is expensive, so bulk materials for colonies {{could come from}} the Moon, a <b>near-Earth</b> <b>object</b> (NEO), Phobos, or Deimos. The benefits of using such sources include: a lower gravitational force, no atmospheric drag on cargo vessels, and no biosphere to damage. Many NEOs contain substantial amounts of metals. Underneath a drier outer crust (much like oil shale), some other NEOs are inactive comets which include billions of tons of water ice and kerogen hydrocarbons, {{as well as some}} nitrogen compounds.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present new results {{obtained}} from our spectroscopic survey of <b>near-Earth</b> <b>objects</b> (called SINEO). We show {{a set of}} 36 visible and near-infrared spectra, recorded with the 3. 5 -m Italian Telescopio Nazionale Galileo at La Palma (Canary Island). We discuss their taxonomic classification (resulting in 25 objects belonging to the S-complex, five to the C-complex and six to the X-complex), and their overall compositional linkage with the principal source of <b>near-Earth</b> <b>objects,</b> namely the Main Belt. Moreover, for some <b>near-Earth</b> <b>objects</b> we found good spectral fit among meteorites. In particular, we achieved an excellent fit for chondrites of different clans. Finally, we discuss the influences of space weathering among small S-type <b>near-Earth</b> <b>objects...</b>|$|R

2500|$|... 25143 Itokawa ( [...] ; [...] ) is a stony sub-kilometer asteroid, {{classified}} as <b>near-Earth</b> <b>object</b> of the Apollo group and potentially hazardous asteroid, that measures approximately 350 meters in diameter. It {{was the first}} asteroid to be {{the target of a}} sample return mission, the Japanese space probe Hayabusa, and the smallest asteroid photographed and visited by a spacecraft.|$|E
2500|$|On July 1994, Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 was a comet {{that broke}} apart and {{collided}} with Jupiter, providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of Solar System objects. The event {{served as a}} [...] "wake-up call", and astronomers responded by starting programs such as Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR), Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT), Lowell Observatory <b>Near-Earth</b> <b>Object</b> Search (LONEOS) and several others which have drastically increased the rate of asteroid discovery.|$|E
2500|$|WT1190F {{was first}} {{discovered}} by the Mount Lemmon Survey, {{a participant in the}} Catalina Sky Survey <b>Near-Earth</b> <b>Object</b> surveying program. [...] The object was identified with an apparent magnitude 19.5 on 18 February 2013, and given the temporary designation UDA34A3, but was lost soon after, with an observation arc of only 5 hours. However, it was again seen by the same survey on 29 November 2013 and given the designation UW8551D and lost again, only being observed for 1 hour 35 minutes.|$|E
