To our knowledge, this is the first report of cutaneous melanoacanthoma affecting the groin. Cutaneous melanoacanthoma is a rare, benign neoplasm. Melanoacanthoma can occur on the oral mucosa. The cause of melanoacanthoma is unknown. Melanoacanthoma has no potential for malignant transformation. Differential diagnoses include melanoma malignum, pigmented basal cell epithelioma, <b>naevus</b> <b>pigmentosus,</b> seborrheic keratosis. Morphologic differential diagnosis is essential to exclude malignant melanoma and other diseases. Simple excision is curative...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} 103 {{patients}} with skin tumors were examined. Among them there were 43 (42 %) male patients and 60 (58 %) female patients. Working diagnosis {{was obtained by}} clinical examination using dermoscope. After excision of lesion, working diagnosis was compared to pathohistological diagnosis. In our study we used dermoscope Heine proper delta 10. The clinical-dermoscopic diagnosis included verrucae seborrhoicae in 26 (25. 24 %), fibropapilloma in 17 (16. 5 %), <b>naevus</b> <b>pigmentosus</b> in 9 (8. 79 %), naevus dysplasticus in 4 (3. 88 %), fibroma molle in 8 (7. 76 %), Mb. Bowen in 1 (0. 97 %), basal cell carcinoma in 7 (6. 79 %), squamous cell carcinoma in 6 (5. 82 %), haemangiofibroma in 1 (0. 97 %), haemangioma in 3 (2. 91 %), keratosis actinica in 5 (4. 85 %), melanoma malignum in 6 (5. 82 %), naevus fibromatosus in 2 (1. 94 %) cases and naevus blue in 1 (0. 97 %), naevus traumatisatus in 1 (0. 97 %), verruca vulgaris in 1 (0. 97 %), lymphocytoma in 1 (0. 97 %), naevus verrucosus in 1 (0. 97 %), lentigo solaris in 2 (1. 94 %) and Reed nevus in 1 (0. 97 %) case. Dermoscopic diagnosis were conformable with pathohistological diagnosis in 75 cases (72. 82,%). We presumed that dermatoscoping obtains correct diagnosis of skin tumors...|$|E
