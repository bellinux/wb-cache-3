50|$|<b>Nail</b> <b>clippers</b> {{are usually}} made of {{stainless}} steel but can also be made of plastic and aluminium. Two common varieties are the plier type and the compound lever type. Most <b>nail</b> <b>clippers</b> usually come with another tool attached, {{which is used to}} clean dirt out from under nails. A nail clipper often has a miniature file fixed to it to allow rough edges of nails to be manicured. A nail file allows for removal of any excess nail that is jagged or has been missed. <b>Nail</b> <b>clippers</b> occasionally come with a pocket knife or a nail catcher; the multi-purpose nail clipper was invented by Hungarian inventor David Gestetner. The nail clipper consists of a head which may be concave or convex. Specialized <b>nail</b> <b>clippers</b> which have convex clipping ends are intended for trimming toenails, while concave clipping ends are for fingernails. The cutting head may be manufactured to be parallel or perpendicular to the principal axis of the cutter. Cutting heads which are parallel to the principal axis are made to address accessibility issues involved with cutting toenails.|$|E

50|$|The {{compound}} lever {{is a simple}} machine operating {{on the premise that}} the resistance from one lever in a system of levers will act as power for the next, and thus the applied force will be amplified from one lever to the next (as long as the mechanical advantage for each lever is greater than one).

5000|$|The {{inventor}} of the <b>nail</b> <b>clipper</b> is not exactly known, but the first United States patent for an improvement in a finger-nail clipper (implying such a device already existed) {{seems to be in}} 1875 by Valentine Fogerty and in the United Kingdom, Hungarian inventor David Gestetner. Other patents for an improvement in finger-nail clippers are in 1876, William C. Edge, and in 1878, John H. Hollman. Filings for complete finger-nail clippers (not merely improvements) include, in 1881, Eugene Heim and Celestin Matz, in 1885, George H. Coates (for a finger-nail cutter), and, in 1905, Chapel S. Carter (son of a Connecticut Baptist church deacon) patented a finger-nail clipper with a later patent in 1922. Around 1913, Carter was secretary of the H. C. Cook Company of Ansonia, Connecticut, which was incorporated in 1903 as the H. C. Cook Machine Company by Henry C. Cook, Lewis I. Cook, and Chapel S. Carter. Around 1928, Carter was president of the company when, he claimed, about 1896, the [...] "Gem"-brand finger <b>nail</b> <b>clipper</b> made its first appearance.|$|R

5000|$|When {{questioned}} by the Deputies, Rosa stated {{that he was in}} the park jogging and then came across Tomlinson's body. Rosa could not provide any valid reasons at all as to why he was wearing white gloves or why he was carrying a flashlight. [...] Blood stains were discovered on both the gloves and on Rosa's jogging pants. Deputies seized a nail clipper that Rosa voluntarily pulled out of his pocket and surrendered to the deputies. When questioned about the <b>nail</b> <b>clippers,</b> Rosa could not provide a reason for why he had the <b>nail</b> <b>clippers</b> in his pocket. Rosa was detained by detectives where he was questioned further but was let go on the same night. This outraged a lot of the neighbors since they believed that Rosa was the perpetrator behind the murder. Rosa continued to remain cooperative as the investigation continued. Even though Rosa was let go by the detectives, he was still considered a person of interest in the case and the prime suspect. Rosa was kept under constant surveillance and a search and seizure warrant was obtained on Rosa's home where his computer, clothes and other evidence were seized. The cause of death was ruled manual strangulation.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{preventive}} foot hygiene measures that can prevent athlete's foot and reduce recurrence. Some of these include keeping the feet dry, clipping toenails short; using a separate <b>nail</b> <b>clipper</b> for infected toenails; using socks made from well-ventilated cotton or synthetic moisture wicking materials (to soak moisture {{away from the}} skin to help keep it dry); avoiding tight-fitting footwear, changing socks frequently; and wearing sandals while walking through communal areas such as gym showers and locker rooms.|$|R
50|$|The royal poinciana is most {{commonly}} propagated by seeds. Seeds are collected, soaked {{in warm water}} for at least 24 hours, and planted in warm, moist soil in a semi-shaded, sheltered position. In lieu of soaking, the seeds can also be 'nicked' or 'pinched' (with a small scissors or <b>nail</b> <b>clipper)</b> and planted immediately. These two methods allow moisture to penetrate the tough outer casing, stimulating germination. The seedlings grow rapidly and can reach 30 cm {{in a few weeks}} under ideal conditions.|$|R
