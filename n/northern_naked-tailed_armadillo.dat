50|$|Today, all extant {{armadillo}} {{species are}} still present in South America. They are particularly diverse in Paraguay (where 11 species exist) and surrounding areas. Many species are endangered. Some, including four species of Dasypus, are widely distributed over the Americas, whereas others, such as Yepes's mulita, {{are restricted to}} small ranges. Two species, the <b>northern</b> <b>naked-tailed</b> <b>armadillo</b> and nine-banded armadillo, are found in Central America; the latter has also reached the United States, primarily in the south-central states (notably Texas), but with a range that extends as far east as South Carolina and Florida, and {{as far north as}} Nebraska and central Indiana. Their range has consistently expanded in North America over the last century {{due to a lack of}} natural predators.|$|E

40|$|The greater <b>naked-tailed</b> <b>{{armadillo}}</b> Cabassous tatouay {{is one of}} the least-known armadillo species. Field {{records are}} rare, if not controversial, and only few specimens exist in scientific collections in Brazil. This species is listed in the Brazilian Red List of Threatened Species as well as in six official Brazilian state Red Lists. Fieldwork was performed between 2005 and 2008 to monitor wildlife in the central-western region of São Paulo State. Cabassous tatouay was registered in three opportunities, in the municipalities of Agudos, Borebi and Avare, and ecological and morphometrical data were registered. Although this species tolerates altered habitats, the scarce field records may be related to its habits and have led to the lack of basic information on greater <b>naked-tailed</b> <b>armadillos.</b> This communication provides important ecological and biogeographical information about C. tatouay...|$|R
50|$|Southern <b>naked-tailed</b> <b>armadillos</b> are solitary, and {{are said}} to be nocturnal in the tropics but have been {{reported}} to be diurnal further south. As are many armadillos, it is an insectivore, feeding almost entirely on ants and termites. Reproduction occurs year-round, and animals have lived up to seven years in captivity.|$|R
50|$|It is the {{smallest}} of the <b>naked-tailed</b> <b>armadillos,</b> having an average head-body length of 30 cm, while the other species range from 32 to 46 cm.

50|$|Larger {{than the}} closely related {{southern}} <b>naked-tailed</b> <b>armadillos,</b> adults {{of the greater}} species measure 41 to 49 cm in head-body length, with a tail 15 to 20 cm in length. There are eight or nine uniformly shaped teeth {{on each side of}} each jaw, with no identifiable incisors or canines. The carapace includes an average of 13 movable bands between the solid shields over the shoulders and hips, with each band having about 30 individual scutes. There is also a scaled shield over the upper surface of the head, with much smaller scales on the ears and on the cheeks below the eyes. The tail bears only small, isolated scales.|$|R
50|$|Different {{studies have}} {{recorded}} different activity patterns for the six-banded armadillo - some consider {{it to be}} diurnal (active mainly during the day), while others show it is nocturnal (active mainly at night). It is an alert animal; unlike other armadillos, it flees on sensing danger and bites if handled. Primarily solitary, six-banded armadillos will congregate only to feed on carrions. A 1983 study in eastern Brazil calculated the mean home range size as 93.3 ha. An efficient digger, this armadillo can dig U-shaped burrows with a single opening, typically in dry areas; the burrows {{may or may not}} be permanent shelters. These burrows can go deep into the ground and help in foraging. A study of burrows dug by the giant, six-banded, southern naked-tailed and greater <b>naked-tailed</b> <b>armadillos</b> showed that all burrows were similar in the slopes of the burrow and the surrounding soil, and the direction of the entrance; the location preferred for them and time spent in them, however, differed. Burrows could be easily differentiated by their dimensions; burrows of six-banded armadillos had a mean height of 19 cm and were 21 cm wide at the opening, and narrowed down to 10 cm with a height of 16 cm to 21 cm into the burrow. Generally, burrows become wide enough to allow the armadillo to turn around as the depth increases. Unlike the moles, that throw the soil to a side while digging, the six-banded armadillo digs with its forefeet and throws the soil behind with its hindfeet. Armadillos defecate outside their burrows.|$|R

As caracter??sticas f??sicas e ambientais de 72 tocas, no campo (n = 31), mata (n = 22) e Restinga (n = 19), encontradas foram analisadas. A densidade de tocas n??o variou significativamente entre estes ambientes. Embora o tatu-galinha seja apontado como uma esp??cie de ??reas florestadas no presente estudo, as ??reas abertas foram utilizadas com a mesma intensidade que mata e restinga. Dentre as vari??veis ambientais o n??mero de ??rvores e porcentagem de cobertura de solo por arbustos tiveram influ??ncia no n??mero de tocas encontradas em mata. A dire????o das tocas foram predominantemente sul nas ??reas de floresta (mata e restinga) e significativamente diferentes das ??reas de campo (campoXmata p = 0, 002; campoXrestinga p = 0, 001).

Armadillos (Cingulata : Dasypodidae), {{despite the}} diversity of species, 21 species, and wide distribution, from Argentina to the southern half of the United States through Central America, information {{on the use of}} animals in these environments is scarce. The excavation and using holes in the ground is an important ecological nature of the group, these structures may be considered conspicuous indicators of the presence of these animals. In the present study I have investigated the density, direction, morphometric and microhabitat of the burrows in different types of plant formation. The study was conducted during 13 months (Oct/ 06 to Nov/ 07) in Itapu?? State Park, in Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. The nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) seems to be the most abundant species at this site, which is still at least one other species, the greater <b>naked-tailed</b> <b>armadillo</b> (Cabassous tatouay). The physical and environmental characteristics of 72 holes, fields (n = 31), forest (n = 22) and Restinga (n = 19), found were analyzed. The density of burrows did not vary significantly between these environments. Although the nine-banded is touted as a kind of wooded areas in the present study, the open areas were used with the same intensity that forest and dunes. Among the environmental variables the number of trees and percentage of ground cover shrubs influenced the number of burrows found in the woods. The direction of the burrows were predominantly southern areas of forest (forest and Restinga) and significantly different from field areas (fieldXforest p = 0. 002; fieldXrestinga p = 0. 001).

5000|$|... the <b>northern</b> voalavo, or <b>naked-tailed</b> voalavo , or just voalavo, (Voalavo gymnocaudus), is a rodent in {{the family}} Nesomyidae found in the {{highlands}} of northern Madagascar. Discovered in 1994 and formally described in 1998, it is the type species of genus Voalavo; its closest relative is the eastern voalavo of the Central Highlands. DNA sequence data suggests {{it may be more}} closely related to Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat than to other species of the closely related genus Eliurus. The northern voalavo is found at 1250 to 1950 m above sea level in montane wet and dry forest in the Marojejy and Anjanaharibe-Sud massifs. Nocturnal and solitary, it lives mainly on the ground, but can climb, and probably eats plant matter. Despite a small range, it is classified as [...] "Least Concern" [...] because it lacks obvious threats and much of its range is within protected areas.|$|R
