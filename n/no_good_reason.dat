The Charter Board emphasized that the draft charter would allow for county affairs to be decided by local representatives rather than by a vote of members of the Maryland General Assembly who represent citizens of all parts of the state. Another group opposing the draft charter opened its headquarters in Bethesda. The group said there was <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> to abolish the functional state-level system already in place, and that the draft charter would increase taxes and establish heads of governmental agencies with indefinite terms who are not directly accountable to the public.

25|$|Bias {{arising out}} of a non-pecuniary {{interest}} can, like a pecuniary interest, result in the automatic disqualification of a judge from hearing a case. In R. v. Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No. 2) (1999), the issue was whether Lord Hoffmann {{should be regarded as}} automatically disqualified from hearing an appeal by Augusto Pinochet against his extradition to Spain to stand trial for crimes against humanity. Lord Hoffmann was the Director and Chairperson of Amnesty International Charity Ltd., a company undertaking the aspects of the work of Amnesty International Ltd. which are charitable under UK law. He had no pecuniary interest in the company as he was neither employed nor paid by it, but had carried out fund-raising for it. Amnesty International Ltd. was a party to the case against Pinochet. The House of Lords decided the issue in the affirmative, stating that as the fundamental principle is that a man cannot be a judge in his own cause, there is <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> in principle for limiting automatic disqualification only to pecuniary interests.|$|E
25|$|The second-oldest {{published}} {{account is}} {{known by the}} opening words of its long title: Huei tlamahuiçoltica ("The great event"). It was published in Nahuatl by the then vicar of the hermitage at Guadalupe, Luis Lasso de la Vega, in 1649. In four places in the introduction, he announced his authorship of {{all or part of}} the text, a claim long received with varying degrees of incredulity because of the text's consummate grasp of a form of classical Nahuatl dating from the mid-16th century, the command of which Lasso de la Vega neither before nor after left any sign. The complete work comprises several elements including a brief biography of Juan Diego and, most famously, a highly wrought and ceremonious account of the apparitions known from its opening words as the Nican Mopohua ("Here it is told"). Despite the variations in style and content which mark the various elements, an exclusively textual analysis by three American investigators published in 1998 provisionally (a) assigned the entire work to the same author or authors, (b) saw <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> to strip de la Vega of the authorship role he had claimed, and (c) of the three possible explanations for the close link between Sánchez's work and the Huei tlamahuiçoltica, opted for a dependence of the latter upon the former which, however, was said to be indicated rather than proved. Whether the role to be attributed to Lasso de la Vega was creative, editorial or redactional remains an open question. Nevertheless, the broad consensus among Mexican historians (both ecclesiastical and secular) has long been, and remains, that the Nican Mopohua dates from as early as the mid-16th century and (so far as it is attributed to any author) that the likeliest hypothesis as to authorship is that Antonio Valeriano wrote it, or at least had a hand in it.The Nican Mopohua was not reprinted or translated in full into Spanish until 1929, although an incomplete translation had been published in 1895 and Becerra Tanco's 1675 account (see next entry) has close affinities with it.|$|E

40|$|The term ‘digital drawing’ may imply {{a special}} kind of drawing, set against a natural approach. Previous generations also had to adjust to the new {{technologies}} of the time. Some resisted, some went ahead. New methods present difficulties as well as opportunities. The how-to-draw books of the 1900 ’s show not just one ‘traditional’ approach, but a wide range, and a healthy debate. For the past two centuries such books have here and there discussed both drawing machines, and the connected question of how to draw machines. One way or another the world of drawing will absorb the impact of computers, and it won’t be just as an isolated genre of slightly weird drawing. So it is wrong to exclude ‘digital’ drawing from surveys, to think of this category as distinct from mainstream drawing. Museums have already collected the significant works, and traced the history. The way forward should be to integrate digital tools within the broad spectrum of drawing types. There are <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> for not using digital devices, and <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> for not using pencils.

40|$|African {{economic}} development is stifled because most countries are notional states. The notional state {{must not be}} confused with rhetoric of corruption and failed states. Rather, the effective reach (in a spatial sense) of the African state is efficiently attenuated in virtue of the benefits and costs of extending coherent governance beyond the capital city. This stands {{in stark contrast to the}} concept and the practice of nation building and the state as it evolved over centuries in Western Europe. In Europe, strong states evolved out of a necessity to protect valuable agricultural assets during an era in which land-based wealth was paramount. European states became strong because they could not afford to be weak. African states are weak because they have <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> to be strong. The “mask of citizenship ” reflects reciprocal estrangement between citizens and the government. Colonialism in Africa did nothing to extend the effective reach of the state, and post-independence governments have found <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> to do so. The essential step to extend the reach of governance beyond the capital city is the tax bargain in which all individuals would contribute to the public purse.

40|$|Naturalism in the {{philosophy}} of mathematics is the view that philosophy cannot legitimately gainsay mathematics. I distinguish between reinterpretation and reconstruction naturalism: the former states that philosophy cannot legitimately sanction a reinterpretation of mathematics (i. e. an interpretation different from the standard one); the latter that philosophy cannot legitimately change standard mathematics (as opposed to its interpretation). I begin by showing that neither form of naturalism is self-refuting. I then focus on reinterpretation naturalism, which comes in two forms, and examine the only available argument for it. I argue that this argument, the so-called Failure Argument, itself fails. My overall conclusion is that although there is no self-refutation argument against reinterpretation naturalism, there are as yet <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> to accept it...|$|R
