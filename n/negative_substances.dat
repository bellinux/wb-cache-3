40|$|Under {{the auspices}} of the Validation Management Group for Ecotoxicity Testing two {{protocols}} for a fish screening assay for endocrine active compounds have been through multi-laboratory testing. The data are reported as Phase- 1 A and Phase- 1 B for each of the two protocols, differing in their protocols such as by the housing conditions of fish. The test substances in those studies tended to be potent, positive pharmaceutical compounds (e. g., 17 β-estradiol and trenbolone in Phase- 1 A and Fadrozole, Prochloraz, and Flutamide in Phase- 1 B) and only a single weak positive, t-pentylphenol, in Phase- 1 B. At the 3 rd meeting of the Validation Management Group for Ecotoxicity Testing in December 2004, the Phase- 1 B protocol was accepted for further work. It was recommended to identify <b>negative</b> <b>substance(s)</b> and, a small number of experts proposed potassium permanganate and n-octanol in June 2005. Several laboratories agreed to participate, and CEFIC agreed to seek funding to support the participation of an additional laboratory. Studies have been conducted by 4 laboratories. One laboratory has tested both substances in medaka, one laboratory has tested both substances in zebrafish, one laboratory has tested both substances in fathead minnow, and the final laboratory tested potassium permanganate in fathead minnow. These results of these studies have already been reported in the OECD Phase 2 report of the validation of the 21 -d fish endocrine screening assay...|$|E
40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} {{method for}} lung related research in vitro is the air-liquid-interface culture (ALI) technique involving biological models (cell lines, primary cells, etc.) on microporous membranes. Techniques {{to use such}} ALI- models in inhalation related in vitro approaches have improved fundamentally {{and at the same}} time led to varying exposure setups. Concerning investigations on pure gases the reproducibility and relevance of these strategies could recently be shown in a prevalidation study comprising round-robin testing of several chemical gases, resulting in a prediction model [1]. However, in case of aerosols the comparability of results of individual labs is still lacking and has to be clearly improved to create relevant results. Therefore, as a first step, defined model setups together with model aerosols are needed to characterize different exposure procedures in individual labs and thus generate comparable and relevant data. To establish a test system which can easily be applied in different exposure setups, an entire concept was developed involving aerosols generated by nebulization and drying of salt solutions including toxic and non-toxic substances of different particle sizes. The aerosols were applied in an ALI exposure setup (P. R. I. T. ® ALI ExpoCube) on A 549 cells and toxic effects were investigated based on viability measurements (WST- 1). A first group consisting of one positive and one negative substance (SDS and NaCl) including different particle sizes was investigated in the aerosol exposure and resulted in reproducible dose- and substance dependent toxic effects with a higher toxicity using positive control (SDS) than the negative aerosol (NaCl). Thus, the proposed concept was successfully tested as a first step to set up a panel of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>substances</b> which can be used to generate aerosols for the characterisation of aerosol inhalation investigation procedures in vitro. By including simple methods for aerosol generation and quantification, a relevant cell line and fast and easy read-out methods, this concept can be applied easily to different exposure applications in vitro. Therefore, it can clearly improve the relevance of data generated using such methods by a concept of standardisation and normalization in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{origin of}} δ 13 C {{variations}} within the skeletons of zooxanthellate scleractinian corals {{is still a}} matter of considerable debate. In particular, the role respired CO 2 plays in controlling the eventual δ 13 C of the skeleton remains unclear. In this study, the temporal variability of the δ 13 C of respired CO 2 produced by Montastraea faveolata has been measured at approximately monthly intervals over a 1 -year period. In these experiments, three corals maintained on a platform at 8 m depth near Molasses Reef in the Florida Keys were incubated in closed chambers for 24 -h periods and samples of the incubation water analyzed for the δ 13 C of the dissolved inorganic carbon (ΣCO 2) at ∼ 3 -h intervals. Throughout the incubation, the concentration of O 2 was measured continuously within the chamber. Our results show that during daylight, the δ 13 C of the ΣCO 2 in the incubation water becomes enriched in 13 C {{as a result of}} fractionation during the fixation of C by photosynthesis, whereas at night the δ 13 C of the ΣCO 2 becomes more negative. The δ 13 C of the respiratory CO 2 ranges from − 9 ‰ in the late spring to values as low as − 17 ‰ in the autumn. The lighter values are significantly more negative than those reported by previous workers for coral tissue and zooxanthellae. An explanation for this discrepancy may be that the corals respire a significant proportion of isotopically <b>negative</b> <b>substances,</b> such as lipids, which are known to have values up to 10 ‰ lighter compared to the bulk δ 13 C of the tissue. The clear seasonal cycle in the δ 13 C of the respiratory CO 2 suggests that there is also seasonal variability in either the δ 13 C of the coral tissue or the type and/or amount of organic material being respired. A similar temporal pattern and magnitude of change was observed in the δ 13 C of the coral tissue samples collected from a nearby reef at monthly intervals between 1995 and 1997. These patterns are similar in timing to the δ 13 C measured in the coral skeletons. We have also calculated an annual mean value for the fractionation factor between dissolved CO 2 − in the external environment and photosynthate fixed by the zooxanthellae of 1. 0121 (± 0. 003). This value is inversely correlated with the ratio of photosynthesis to respiration (P/R) of the entire organism and shows the highest values during the summer months...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background: Inattention to {{symptoms}} {{of mental disorders}} and substance abuse in patients with HIV/AIDS and other at-risk groups, may lead to irreversible damages. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the psychopathological dimensions in substance abusers with and without HIV/AIDS and healthy matched groups. Methods: In a cross-sectional and analytical study, selected samples (by available, consecutive, and objective methods) were 43 HIV-positive substance abusers, 49 HIV <b>negative</b> <b>substance</b> abusers under methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) in the counseling clinic of Behavioral Diseases and Addiction Abandonment, and 45 ordinary individuals. All of them were evaluated by matched confounding variables via Symptom Checklist- 90 -Revised (SCL- 90 -R). Findings: Results indicated a significant difference between these groups in the Global Severity Index (GSI), Positive Symptom Distress Index (PSDI), and Positive Symptom Total (PST) (P < 0. 001). Two by two the comparison of the three groups from psychopathological dimensions revealed that substance abusers with HIV/AIDS persistently suffer more mental problems in all dimensions compared with healthy individuals (P < 0. 05). In addition, in comparison with HIV <b>negative</b> <b>substance</b> abusers, they also suffer more mental problems in other dimensions, including somatization, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, phobia, and psychoticism (P < 0. 05). Yet, the difference in paranoid ideation, hostility, and obsessive-compulsive cases was insignificant. Two by two, the comparison between healthy individuals and substance abusers without HIV/AIDS showed higher levels of depression and psychoticism in substance abusers (P < 0. 05), but no difference in other dimensions. Conclusion: Comorbidity of substance abuse and HIV diagnosis intensify mental disorder symptoms. Moreover, lack of prevention and implementation of appropriate psychological and psychiatric interventions after substance abuse and HIV lead to extended establishment of mental disorder symptoms.

40|$|Human milk {{is a poor}} {{source of}} iron. At birth, the newborn is well endowed with iron stores, which are {{adequate}} to meet his/her needs for the first 4 - 6 months of infancy (WHO March 2001), and iron deficiency is rare. On the other hand, iron deficiency is prevalent among infants between 6 - 12 months of age, particularly in developing countries, and iron supplementation during breastfeeding, and thereafter, is recommended, in addition to 6 months exclusive breastfeeding (WHO, 2002). If exclusively breastfed infants are becoming anemic by the time complementary foods are first being introduced, this raises a challenge to our assumptions {{about the nature of}} human bio-cultural evolution. Is the anemia of infancy normal or did usual feeding practices prevent it? As iron supplementation was not possible until recently, I hypothesized that exclusive breastfeeding was complemented by premasticated foods during our evolution as a hunting-gathering species. In other words, that iron deficiency in infancy is a recent problem in human society, which was previously prevented by premastication. The goals of this research were to assess the prevalence of premastication in non-modern societies in order to determine whether (1) it was prevalent enough to support plausibly its role as a behavioral adaptation to prevent iron deficiency and (2) to determine whether the potentially detrimental effects of premasticated food were harmful enough to be selected against. This research involves several lines of investigation: 1) bringing together the evidence that iron deficiency is a common problem, which is now found in many different regions of the world, 2) a cross-cultural study, using the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF) to obtain ethnographic data on the distribution and time depth of premastication in human societies, 3) a field research study in China, based on interviews conducted by University students, to examine the potential for serious under-reporting of pre-mastication in the ethnographic studies, 4) a review of the iron content of foods that are reported to be premasticated, and 5) a review of the scientific literature on the content of saliva. In the HRAF analysis, 39 cultures out of 119 cultures (33 %) that contain any information on infant feeding describe premastication as an infant feeding practice. Notably none of the ethnographies from China mention premastication. However, the field survey in China, with a sample of 104 elite college students, found that 63 % (65 of 104) were fed pre-masticated food when they were infants, and those who received premasticated foods {{were more likely to be}} fed complementary foods earlier than those who did not. The survey findings support the notion that premastication tends to be under-reported in ethnographic studies. Although salvia has not been as extensively studied as breastmilk, the review of the biomedical literature suggests that it contains several potential positive substances from the perspective of infant health and fewer <b>negative</b> <b>substances</b> than are commonly assumed. The results of the various lines of investigation suggest that pre-mastication has been a common practice in human societies, but has been significantly under-reported. The potential dangers of increased infection that pre-mastication poses for infant health have probably been less serious than the disadvantages of not engaging in pre-mastication, which is a means of giving infants iron to prevent deficiency as stores begin to drop during the first semester of life. Therefore I conclude it is probable that pre-mastication was the behavior/cultural solution to the complementary feeding challenge in human societies, that it probably prevented the level of iron deficiency, which is common today in poor societies...|$|E

This portion of phase 2 assessed the reproducibility of the assay with a battery of positive and <b>negative</b> test <b>substances.</b> Positive agonists of the estrogen receptor included the potent reference estrogen 17 -ethinyl estradiol (EE), and the weak estrogen agonists bisphenol A, genistein, methoxychlor, nonylphenol, and o,p -DDT. The <b>negative</b> test <b>substance</b> or nonagonist was n-dibutylphthalate. The test substances were coded, and prescribed doses of each test substance were administered in 16 laboratories. Two versions of the uterotrophic assay, the intact immature and the adult ovariectomized female rat, were tested and compared using four standardized protocols covering both sc and po administration. Assay reproducibility was compared using a) EE doses identical to those used in phase 1 and in parallel dose-response studies, b) single doses of the weak agonists identical to one of five doses from the dose-response studies, and c) a single dose of the <b>negative</b> test <b>substance.</b> The results were reproducible and in agreement both within individual laboratories and across the participating laboratories for the same test substance and protocol. The few exceptions are examined in detail. The reproducibility was achieved despite {{a variety of different}} experimental conditions (e. g., variations in animal strain, diet, housing protocol, bedding, vehicle, animal age).

40|$|This article takes a {{systematic}} approach to reviewing substance use pre-vention programs introduced {{in elementary school}} (K– 6 th grade). Previous studies evaluating such programs among elementary school students showed mixed effects on subsequent substance use and related psychosocial factors. Thirty published evaluation studies of 24 elementary school-based substance use prevention programs were reviewed. The study selection criteria included searching for program evaluations from 1980 to 2008. Among 27 evaluation studies that examined program effects on substance use, 56 % (n = 15) found significant decreases. In addition, programs most often demonstrated effects on increasing <b>negative</b> <b>substance</b> use attitudes, increasing knowledge, decreasing perceptions of prevalence rates (i. e., descriptive norms), and improving resistance skills. These results have implications for the appro-priateness and value of introducing substance use prevention programs to youth in elementary school.

Immune system activation rather than drug use may explain cerebral symptoms. In HCV positive substance users anxiety and depression are more prevalent than in HCV <b>negative</b> <b>substance</b> users. During treatment with regular or pegylated (PEG) interferon depression is a frequent side effect (ca 30 %) and occurs independently from pre-existing psychiatric disorders or drug abuse. A history of drug abuse per se does not increase the risk of depression as a side effect of interferon treatment. It is extremely important to monitor symptoms of depression in the early weeks of treatment and to start antidepressant treatment as early as possible. Antidepressants should be continued throughout the interferon treatment period. There are insufficient data to assess these situations in which preventive antidepressant treatment should be started before interferon treatment. Clinical judgement can, however, lead to preventive antidepressant treatment, even at subclinical levels of depression.

PCC may be beneficial among SUMSM screening <b>negative</b> for <b>substance</b> dependence.

40|$|The {{study of}} substances, {{concerning}} their potential inhalative toxicology, traditionally follows from in vivo animal experimentation studies. For financial, temporal and ethical reasons {{even in this}} field of toxicology an increasing search of alternative test methods, which can generate reliable data, takes place. Conventional in vitro methods provide the testing of substances, which are dissolved in medium. This test method, termed as submerged exposure, neither matches the physiological conditions in the lung, nor describes the inhalative exposure appropriately. The aim of this bachelor thesis was to establish and verify an experimental approach {{for the study of}} inhalable test substances with selected model substances {{on the basis of a}} novel, device-based in vitro test method. Developed at the Fraunhofer ITEM, the P. R. I. T. ®-ExpoCube enables the exposure of a biological test system to airborne substances, simulating in vivo-like conditions. The human originated A 549 cell line served as biological test system, whereas it has characteristics of alveolar lung epithelial cells. The target cells were cultured under so-called air/liquid interface (ALI-) conditions on microporous cell culture inserts, in which the cells were supplied basolaterally with culture medium and exposed apically with a test aerosol. Previously the model substance aerosols were physically characterised by using a cascade impactor. Based on the data of the submerged testing, SDS (positive <b>substance)</b> and NaCl (<b>negative</b> <b>substance)</b> were selected from the six model substance candidates SDS, CuSO 4, LiCl, 5 -Fluorouracil, NaCl and lactose. These two model substances were used in the device-based method. After aerosolisation and deposition on the target cells under ALI-conditions, dose-response curves were established. Resulting from these, effective dose (ED) values were determined for the aerosolised model substances and compared with the ED values of the submerged testing. The particle sizes of the generated model aerosols ranged between 389 - 1580 nm. A toxicity ranking was derrived from the results of the conventional test method with dissolved model substances. This corresponded to the results of the ranking, obtained with the same model substances after aerosolisation and deposition under ALI-conditions and proved as a consequence the plausibility of this method. The results of the present study attest the general feasibility and the high potential of this in vitro test method for applications in the field of inhalation toxicology. An expansion of the database, including further substances and target cells of the respiratory tract (tracheal, bronchial), could be the next step that will be needed for further evaluation of the method aiming at the risk assessment of substances based on in vitro methods...|$|R
