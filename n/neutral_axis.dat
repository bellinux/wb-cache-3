25|$|HSL and HSV {{are simple}} transformations of RGB which {{preserve}} symmetries in the RGB cube unrelated to human perception, such that its R, G, and B corners are equidistant from the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis,</b> and equally spaced around it. If we plot the RGB gamut {{in a more}} perceptually-uniform space, such as CIELAB (see below), it becomes immediately clear that the red, green, and blue primaries {{do not have the}} same lightness or chroma, or evenly spaced hues. Furthermore, different RGB displays use different primaries, and so have different gamuts. Because HSL and HSV are defined purely with reference to some RGB space, they are not absolute color spaces: to specify a color precisely requires reporting not only HSL or HSV values, but also the characteristics of the RGB space they are based on, including the gamma correction in use.|$|E
2500|$|Arching or {{compressive}} membrane action (CMA) in {{reinforced concrete}} slabs occurs {{as a result}} of the great difference between the tensile and compressive strength of concrete.

The wire mesh is clad with a metal such as nickel to provide an improved leading edge protective device which is firmly anchored within the composite structure.

If we take our tilted RGB cube, and project it onto the [...] "chromaticity plane" [...] perpendicular to the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis,</b> our projection takes the shape of a hexagon, with red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and magenta at its corners (...)

30|$|Varus {{malalignment}} of {{the knee}} {{is associated with the}} development and progression of knee osteoarthritis [1]. In a biomechanical study, it was demonstrated that the cartilage of the medial compartment {{of the knee}} is loaded predominantly in a varus knee; a <b>neutral</b> mechanical <b>axis</b> loads the medial slightly more than the lateral compartment; and in valgus alignment the main load is through the lateral compartment [2].|$|R
30|$|The {{concept of}} neutral {{alignment}} after TKA {{has recently been}} challenged, however. In a study by Matziolis et al. [9] it was postulated that a varus malalignment after TKA {{has no effect on}} clinical outcome. In another study by Bellemans [1] it was proposed to re-establish the patient’s own native baseline type of alignment.

50|$|The <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> is an axis in {{the cross}} section of a beam (a member {{resisting}} bending) or shaft along {{which there are no}} longitudinal stresses or strains. If the section is symmetric, isotropic and is not curved before a bend occurs, then the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> is at the geometric centroid. All fibers {{on one side of the}} <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> are in a state of tension, while those on the opposite side are in compression.|$|E
50|$|A beam under bending sees high {{stresses}} {{along the}} axial fibers that are farthest from the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis.</b> To prevent failure, {{most of the}} material in the beam must be located in these regions. Comparatively little material is needed in the area close to the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis.</b> This observation {{is the basis of}} the I-beam cross-section; the <b>neutral</b> <b>axis</b> runs along the center of the web which can be relatively thin and most of the material can be concentrated in the flanges.|$|E
30|$|Lower limb {{alignment}} is {{an important}} factor to consider in the assessment of a painful MOA knee, independently of ACL status. In the presence of extra-articular deformity, and initial-to-moderate OA, HTO would be the treatment of choice to correct the varus malalignment, thus restoring a <b>neutral</b> mechanical <b>axis</b> and reducing pressures on cartilage defects [12]. In contrast, a well aligned knee is better approached with a UKA, because its main aim is to restore the ligament to normal rather than to correct limb alignment without altering the physiological joint line [10].|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesAs CAD/CAM {{technologies}} improve we {{question whether}} adhesive lamination {{of ceramic materials}} could offer mechanical advantages over monolithic structures and improve clinical outcomes. The aim was to identify whether an adhesive interface (a chemically cured resin–cement) would influence the biaxial flexure strength (BFS) and slow-crack growth in a machinable dental ceramic. MethodsMonolithic and adhesively laminated (with a chemically cured dimethacrylate resin–cement) feldspathic ceramic discs of identical dimensions were fabricated. BFS testing {{was performed on the}} Group A monolithic specimens (n= 20), on Group B laminated specimens with the adhesive interface positioned below the <b>neutral</b> bending <b>axis</b> (n= 20) and Group C laminated specimens with the adhesive interface positioned above the <b>neutral</b> bending <b>axis</b> (n= 20). To study subcritical crack growth additional laminated specimens received controlled indentations and were exposed to thermo-mechanical fatigue. BFS data was analysed using parametric statistics (α= 0. 05). Fractographic analyses were qualitatively assessed. ResultsNo significant differences between the mean BFS data of Groups A and B were observed (p= 0. 92) but the mean BFS of Group C was slightly reduced (p< 0. 01). Lamination reduced the stiffness of the structure and fractographic analysis demonstrated that energy consuming crack deflection occurred. Thermo-mechanical fatigue caused subcritical extension of radial cracks associated with indentations adjacent to the adhesive interface. Crack growth was limited to parallel to the interface and was arrested or deflected in a direction normal to the interface. ConclusionsCeramic lamination increased the damage tolerance of the structure and could limit or arrest subcritical crack growth at regions near the ‘interlayer’. Clinical SignificanceLamination of a dental ceramic with a polymeric ‘interlayer’ could offer toughening effects which could potentially delay or arrest sub-critical crack growth at regions near the interface and thereby improve restoration longevity...|$|R
30|$|When {{our results}} {{are viewed from}} the {{kinematic}} perspective the unclear association between mechanical alignment and outcome makes sense given {{that there is a}} large variation in the anatomy of femora and tibiae and that most patients do not have a <b>neutral</b> hip–knee–ankle <b>axis</b> (Hollister et al. 1993). It is entirely possible that an anatomically (kinematically) aligned, but mechanically malaligned, implanted prosthesis could recreate a patient’s preoperative kinematics. Howell et al. (2015) concluded that kinematic aligned knee replacement did not adversely affect implant survival or function as it restores the constitutional alignment of the limb and joint line, subsequently avoiding collateral ligament imbalances. This would create a group of patients that, {{for the purposes of the}} studies included in this review, were “malaligned”, but had good PROMs scores based on their alignment. This could explain the dubious relationship demonstrated between alignment and outcome.|$|R

40|$|A bilayer sensor {{consisting}} of a stress sensitive magnetoelastic layer mounted onto a support substrate has been developed utilizing its change in curvature when subjected to gas flow forces. Two different materials, aluminium and HAVAR, with various thicknesses were used as the support layer to investigate the effect of bilayer stiffness on sensor sensitivity. Selection of the support layer was also important in determining {{the location of the}} <b>neutral</b> bending <b>axis</b> of the composite bilayer ensuring maximum stress sensitivity within the magnetic layer. Change in magnetic permeability proportional to stress was detected by measuring the inductance of a pickup coil positioned around one end of the bilayer sensor.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{calculate}} the indirect costs of Patient Specific Instruments (PSI) {{based on an}} opportunity cost, cost of efforts and a supply chain cost model to compare PSI for value with conventional total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: In 81 patients the total (direct+indirect) cost of PSI-assisted TKA was compared with conventional TKA.

RESULTS: Indirect costs (459 euro) make up 40 % of the total cost that can run up to 1142 euro for a patient operated with PSI guides.

30|$|The leg {{alignment}} after deformity correction {{ranged from}} 1.3 ° valgus to 7.1 ° varus; the aims for correction differed from unloading {{in case of}} medial compartment osteoarthritis, decrease in varus to normal varus or restoration of limb symmetry (see also Table  3). In four patients, the valgus osteotomies were performed for a varus that had arisen from a previous overcorrection of a valgus deformity. In most of these cases, a <b>neutral</b> mechanical <b>axis</b> was intended. One osteotomy had resulted in an under correction. Performing a closed-wedge osteotomy {{is known to be}} difficult technically because the surgeon has to rely on the accuracy of the bone resection. Careful preoperative planning and the use of oblique osteotomy cuts of equal length in an isosceles triangle prevent cortical overlap after gap closure [6, 16]. Our final range of tibiofemoral angles were within a similar range to that published for distal femoral varus osteotomies (6 ° varus to 10 ° valgus) [24].|$|R

An implant with a minimum insert thickness of 8  mm was used. Data regarding leg axis, joint line, insert thickness and tibial resection depth were recorded by the navigation device. An algorithm was developed to calculate the optimal tibial resection depth. The required tibial resection significantly correlates with the preoperative leg axis (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). In valgus deformities the required resection depth averaged 5. 1  mm and was significantly reduced compared to knees with a <b>neutral</b> leg <b>axis</b> (6. 8  mm, p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and varus deformities (8. 0  mm, p[*]<[*] 0. 001).

Determination of NHP is useful when reconstructing facial form in art, forensics, orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning for surgical management of craniofacial dysmorphic conditions. When NHP is uncertain, correction such as orientation to Frankfurt horizontal (FH) has been advocated.

40|$|A male Drosophila {{model of}} {{locomotor}} deficit induced by chronic pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), a proconvulsant used to model epileptogenesis in rodents, {{has recently been}} described. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) ameliorate development of this behavioral abnormality. Time-series of microarray profiling of heads of male flies treated with PTZ has shown epileptogenesis-like transcriptomic perturbation in the fly model. Gender differences are known to exist in neurological and psychiatric conditions including epileptogenesis. We describe here the effects of chronic PTZ in Drosophila females, and compare the results with the male model. As in males, chronic PTZ was found found to cause a decreased climbing speed in females. In males, overrepresentation of Wnt, MAPK, TGF-beta, JAK-STAT, Cell communication, and Dorso-Ventral axis formation pathways in downregulated genes was previously described. Of these, female genes showed enrichment only for Dorso-Ventral axis formation. Most significant, ribosomal pathway was uniquely overrepresented in genes downregulated in females. Gender differences thus exist in the Drosophila model. Gender <b>neutral,</b> Dorso-Ventral <b>axis</b> formation may be considered as the candidate causal pathway in chronic pentylenetetrazole induced behavioral deficit.
