500|$|The eggs of {{this species}} look {{similar to those of}} the related <b>northwestern</b> <b>{{salamander}}</b> (A. gracile) and tiger salamander (A. tigrinum). Like many amphibians, the eggs of the long-toed salamander are surrounded by a gelatinous capsule. This capsule is transparent, making the embryo visible during development. Unlike A.gracile eggs, there are no visible signs of green algae, which makes egg jellies green in color. When in its egg, the long-toed salamander embryo is darker on top and whiter below compared to a tiger salamander embryo that is light brown to grey above and cream-colored on the bottom. The eggs are about [...] or greater in diameter with a wide outer jelly layer. Prior to hatching—both in the egg and as newborn larvae—they have balancers, which are thin skin protrusions sticking out the sides and supporting the head. The balancers eventually fall off and their external gills grow larger. Once the balancers are lost the larvae are distinguished by the sharply pointed flaring of the gills. As the larvae mature and metamorphose, their limbs with digits become visible and the gills are resorbed.|$|E
500|$|At hatching, {{a typical}} {{salamander}} larva has eyes without lids, teeth in both {{upper and lower}} jaws, three pairs of feathery external gills, a somewhat laterally flattened body and a long tail with dorsal and ventral fins. The forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pond-living species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water. Pond-type larvae often have a pair of balancers, rod-like structures {{on either side of}} the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment. Some members of the genera Ambystoma and Dicamptodon have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form, but this varies with species and with populations. The <b>northwestern</b> <b>salamander</b> (Ambystoma gracile) is one of these and, depending on environmental factors, either remains permanently in the larval state, a condition known as neoteny, or transforms into an adult. Both of these are able to breed. Neoteny occurs when the animal's growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine. Other factors that may inhibit metamorphosis include lack of food, lack of trace elements and competition from conspecifics. The tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) also sometimes behaves in this way and may grow particularly large in the process. The adult tiger salamander is terrestrial, but the larva is aquatic and able to breed while still in the larval state. When conditions are particularly inhospitable on land, larval breeding may allow continuation of a population that would otherwise die out.

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Ultraviolet-B {{radiation}} (UV-B) {{has been}} suggested as a factor contributing to global amphibian population declines. While ambient UV-B levels damage the eggs and embryos of some amphibian species, few studies have addressed how UV-B affects other life history stages or sublethal responses. My dissertation focuses on (1) investigations of sublethal effects of UV-B exposure on growth and development in larval amphibians, (2) a preliminary examination of the hormonal stress response in larval amphibians exposed to UV-B and (3) investigations of defenses that amphibians may use to prevent UV-B damage. Delayed sublethal responses to UV-B were documented for red legged frogs (Rana aurora). Larvae exposed to ambient UV-B during embryonic development were smaller and less developed one month after hatching than larvae not exposed as embryos. Exposure of larval long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) to UV-B in the laboratory resulted in sublethal effects on growth for larvae from mountain sites and in decreased survival for larvae from lower elevation. Mountain populations {{appear to be more}} resistant to the detrimental effects of UV-B exposure. However, although UV-B can have various sublethal effects on growth and development, I did not observe a hormonal stress response in larvae of four species. One potential mechanism of UV-B protection is skin darkening.

In summary, my results suggest that even at current levels, UV-B may have impacts on amphibian life histories. While direct mortality in response to UV-B exposure may be observed for some species, there are many sublethal responses as well. These sublethal responses could be important for the long-term survival of amphibian populations...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 In {{the summers}} of 1973, 1974 and 1975, I {{investigated}} population age structure and density, and behaviors relating to habitat selection, predator avoidance and intraspecific interaction {{in a population}} of <b>northwestern</b> <b>salamanders</b> in a lake in the Oregon Cascade Mountains. The study {{was carried out by}} skin- and scuba-diving at night, observing or netting the salamanders directly. Population density and age structure remained stationary from 1973 to mid- 1975, when density fell and the age structure shifted toward domination by older age classes. This change in the population was apparently due to the stocking of more fish into the lake. The salamanders had definite depth preferences, with slight but significant differences in preference between age classes. No salamander was found in water deeper than 1. 3 m. The salamanders utilized bare mud substrate much less than would be expected on the basis of frequency of occurrence of the substrate, and utilized substrate covered with twigs and wood chips more often than would be expected. When escaping from a simulated predator attack the salamanders avoided bare mud completely. Those animals occupying areas covered with thick grass (Isoetes) tended to move to areas with much sparser grass clumps, when escaping. Preferences based on temperature, oxygen tension or the presence of large pieces of cover such as logs were not evident. Frequencies of predator avoidance behaviors were different in the different age classes. In the case of one-year olds, behavioral frequencies changed after the stocking of new fish. Before the stock ing, the one -year olds tended to avoid orienting in a direction perpendicular to the shore/deep water axis (laterally). If they did orient in this direction, they turned away from it when escaping a simulated predator attack. After the stocking, orientation and direction of escape were essentially random. At the end of the escape movement those one-year olds oriented towards shore and/or in deeper water (> 70 cm) burrowed into the substrate; those oriented towards deep water and/or in shallow water (< 70 cm) remained on top of the substrate. Two-year olds were essentially random in orientation and direction of escape. At the end of the escape movement those individuals in deeper water burrowed into the substrate; those in shallow water remained on top of the substrate. Three-year old and older salamanders demonstrated quite complex predator avoidance behavior. Animals in this age group tended to avoid orienting laterally, turning towards deep water much more often than would be expected on a random basis. Those animals in deeper water oriented toward deep water; those in shallow water oriented toward shore. These individuals moved straight ahead when escaping a simulated predator. Laterally-oriented animals avoided escaping straight ahead: those in deep water turned towards deep water, while those in shallow water turned towards shore. Most (75...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Silviculture {{systems that}} involve {{commercial}} thinning may provide higher quality wildlife habitat than traditional clearcut systems, yet such systems {{have not been}} vigorously tested. This prospective study examined forest floor animal abundance and habitat relationships under three different silviculture conditions: clearcuts, commercial thins, and uncuts. Eighteen stands, six per treatment, were selected in the Umpqua National Forest, in the southern Oregon Cascades, and surveyed for ground-dwelling fauna. A total of 3, 359 arthropods, 202 gastropods, 212 amphibians, and 456 small mammals were captured in pitfall traps; 130 gastropods and 19 salamanders were located during transect searches. Pitfall traps were open for 28 consecutive days in fall 1999; because of large numbers captured arthropods were counted only on the first nine sample days. Western-red backed vole (Clethrionomys californicus) and overall amphibian captures, and gastropod species richness and diversity decreased with harvest intensity. Small mammal and amphibian species richness and <b>northwestern</b> <b>salamander</b> (Ambystoma gracile) captures were significantly higher in uncut stands than either thins or clearcuts. Ensatina (Ensatina eschscholtzii) and Haplotrema snail captures were significantly higher in thin stands than clearcut stands, though, captures did not differ between clearcuts and uncuts. Small mammal, Trowbridge shrew (Sorex trowbridgii), gastropod, and cricket (Gryllidae/Gryllacrididae) captures were similar between thin and uncut stands but there were significantly fewer captures in clearcuts than uncuts. Vagrant shrew (S. vagrans), grasshopper (Acrididae), beetle (Coleoptera), and millipede (Diplopoda) captures were highest in clearcut stands. No treatment differences were observed for deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), Oregon voles (Microtus oregoni), Vespericola snails, reticulated tail dropper slugs (Prophysaon andersoni), overall arthropods, or spiders (Araneae). Multiple linear regression results showed that canopy cover and basal area were important habitat variables for Trowbridge shrews, Haplotrema snails, and crickets, which suggests that these animals may be sensitive to tree removal. Other important habitat variables were down wood volume (Haplotrema and cricket), shrub cover (Haplotrema), duff and litter depth (ensatina and Vespericola) and gravely soils (Haplotrema). Trowbridge shrew, Ensatina, and Haplotrema detections were positively correlated with relative humidity and rainfall. Grasshoppers were the only animal analyzed for habitat relationships that were correlated to open forest habitat. In sum, 4 of the 15 ground-dwelling fauna species analyzed for treatment differences were found more frequently in uncuts than clearcuts. Four species had higher capture rates in thins than clearcuts and only 1 species (<b>northwestern</b> <b>salamander)</b> was captured more frequently in uncuts than thins.

The {{objective of this}} research was to document and evaluate the distributions and abundances of the two species, relative to habitat characteristics of ponds in the park. Amphibian distributions and abundances were assessed in 20 ponds from June through September 1993 to 1996. Nutrient concentrations (total nitrogen, Kjeldahl-N, total phosphorus, and orthophosphate-P), habitat characteristics (surface area, depth, elevation, substratum organic content lost on ignition, amount of coarse woody debris, aquatic vegetation, and bottom firmness), and water quality (temperature, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, conductivity, and pH) were measured. Distinct habitat associations were found for each Ambystoma species. Ponds with one species only were different in surface area, maximum depth, substratum organic content, and elevation. Ponds with A. macrodactylum were small, shallow, high in elevation, and had firm sediments low in organic matter relative to A. gracile ponds. Ambystoma macrodactylum ponds typically contained little coarse woody debris relative to the amount of aquatic vegetation. Ambystoma gracile ponds were large, deep, low in elevation, had flocculent sediment high in organic content, abundant coarse woody debris, and little aquatic vegetation relative to A. macrodactylum ponds.

Male salamanders lay spermatophores, which are protein-filled capsules, on plant matter in and around ponds. Spermatophores are exposed to the environment before use by females in internal fertilization. Thus, we investigated possible sources of the algae in Quarry pond in Connecticut, U. S. A., by comparing rbcL chloroplast sequences of algae cultured from spermatophores, cloacal swabs of male and female salamanders, egg jelly samples, and multiple eggs across clutches. Sequences of algae from eggs were distributed into five phylogenetic lineages; those from jelly, cloacal swabs, and spermatophores were found in three lineages, two of which were shared with those from eggs. In addition, all sequences from cloacal swabs aligned with sequences of free-living algae from the class Trebouxiophyceae.

However, {{our understanding of how}} local and landscape characteristics of urban aquatic habitat promote or inhibit amphibian occupancy and recruitment is limited.

We collected occurrence data for five native amphibians: <b>northwestern</b> <b>salamander</b> (Ambystoma gracile), long-toed salamander (A. macrodactylum), Pacific chorus frog (Pseudacris regilla), northern red-legged frog (Rana aurora aurora), and rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa) as well as one non-native amphibian, the American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus). One hundred sites were surveyed from 2007 to 2013. Local and landscape attributes were characterized for each site, and potential drivers of species occupancy were evaluated using a combination of multivariate approaches and generalized linear models. In general, percent impervious surface and distance to nearest forest patch, both associated with urbanization, were negatively correlated with site occupancy for all species. Non-native vegetation was also negatively associated with occupancy of three species (long-toed salamanders, Pacific chorus frogs, and northern red-legged frogs). In contrast, occupancy was positively correlated with pond depth and hydroperiod length for all species. We found evidence of two distinct groups of co-occurring amphibian species driven by habitat depth and hydroperiod. Finally, we report results of threshold analyses that examined species-specific habitat associations. This study describes urban habitat associations of a native amphibian community, identifies factors with positive, negative or mixed relationships with amphibian species, and is an important step in informing the management of urban aquatic habitat to promote persistence of native amphibians...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. ⎯Reproductive {{success of}} {{amphibians}} {{is influenced by}} choice of oviposition sites, including NorthwesternSalamanders (Ambystoma gracile) whose egg masses are fixed to vegetation. During summers of 1999 - 2002, I surveyed 33 permanent ponds in a 26 ha wetland (935 m elevation) for <b>Northwestern</b> <b>Salamander</b> egg masses, quantified oviposition sitecharacteristics, and tracked embryonic development and survival. The number of egg masses found ranged from 141 - 235 annually, and the active oviposition period was 4 - 8 weeks. An average (+ SE) of 63. 4 ± 3. 7 % of egg masses were attached tostems of Sitka Sedge (Carex sitchensis), 23. 3 ± 3. 4 % to overhanging shrub stems or completely submerged sticks, and 8. 3 ± 4. 9 % were unattached. On average, 62. 0 ± 6. 1 % of egg masses were in deep water, 25. 7 ± 4. 9 % in shallow water, and 12. 3 ± 2. 6 % {{along the edge of}} deep and shallow areas. Egg masses were deposited at an average depth of 24. 4 ± 0. 5 cm. A mean of 53. 1 ± 3. 5 % of egg masses had at least one embryo hatch, which on average took 9. 0 ± 0. 5 weeks. Rough-skinned Newts(Taricha granulosa) were observed feeding on embryos. Regression tree models indicated that use of ponds for oviposition wasnegatively influenced by the relative abundance of Rough-skinned Newts, and positively related to the relative abundance oflarval Northwestern Salamanders. Hatching success was greatest in intermediate sized ponds where the number ofoverhanging shrubs was greatest. These results suggest that Northwestern Salamanders avoided ponds where potentialpredators were most abundant (including Brook Trout, Salvelinus fontinalis) and that the presence of larval conspecifics wasindicative of favorable oviposition and rearing habitats...|$|E
40|$|The {{genetics}} {{of colonization}} is understudied in salamanders but has large conservation implications as new habitats are formed or restored to their previous condition. The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens provided a natural experiment {{to study the}} genetic effects of a large infrequent environmental disturbance on two species of salamander, Taricha granulosa (Rough-skinned newt) and Ambystoma gracile (<b>Northwestern</b> <b>salamander).</b> Both these species breed in ponds, and are thought to exhibit high breeding site fidelity and low vagility. I designated three treatments based {{on the effects of}} the eruption: new ponds (created by the eruption, immigrants only), recovery lakes (in blast zone, survivors plus immigrants), and reference lakes (unaffected by eruption, assumed to represent pre-eruption genetic diversity measures). Salamanders took at least nine years to colonize the new ponds. I studied the population genetics of colonization and recovery using microsatellites and AFLPs (amplified fragment length polymorphisms) to measure genetic diversity, gene flow, and population substructure at Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. Based on population genetics theory and the life history characteristics of these pond-breeding amphibians, I predicted that genetic diversity would be lower in newly colonized ponds compared to recovery or reference sites. I also expected significant levels of population substructuring. Finally, I predicted that because of their lower vagility and large number of neotenes, that A. gracile would have less gene flow and a greater degree of population substructuring than T. granulosa. My predictions were not supported by my data. There was no loss of genetic diversity in new or recovery populations in either species. There was no strong evidence for population substructure by either AMOVA, isolation by distance or principal components analysis. Gene flow (Fst) was high in both species. Taricha granulosa and A. gracile were found to be resistant to a large infrequent environmental disturbance. Loss of genetic variability in new populations cannot automatically be assumed. Predicting dispersal and colonization ability based on the broad category of pond-breeding amphibian is not always reliable...|$|E
