50|$|The CHASE domain is an {{extracellular}} protein domain, {{which is}} found in transmembrane receptor from bacteria, lower eukaryotes and plants. It has been named CHASE (Cyclases/Histidine kinases Associated Sensory Extracellular) because of its presence in diverse receptor-like proteins with histidine kinase and nucleotide cyclase domains. The CHASE domain is 200-230 amino acids long and always occurs <b>N-terminally</b> in extracellular or periplasmic locations, followed by an intracellular tail housing diverse enzymatic signalling domains such as histidine kinase, adenyl cyclase, GGDEF-type nucleotide cyclase and EAL-type phosphodiesterase domains, as well as non-enzymatic domains such PAS, GAF, phosphohistidine and response regulatory domains. The CHASE domain is predicted to bind diverse low molecular weight ligands, such as the cytokinin-like adenine derivatives or peptides, and mediate signal transduction through the respective receptors.|$|E
50|$|In a {{zinc finger}} protein, certain {{sequences}} of amino acid residues {{are able to}} recognise and bind to an extended target-site of four or even five nucleotides When this occurs in a ZFP in which the three-nucleotide subsites are contiguous, one zinc finger interferes with the target-site of the zinc finger adjacent to it, a situation known as target-site overlap. For example, a zinc finger containing arginine at position -1 and aspartic acid at position 2 along its alpha-helix will recognise an extended sequence of four nucleotides of the sequence 5'-NNG(G/T)-3'. The hydrogen bond between Asp2 and the N4 of either a cytosine or adenine base paired to the guanine or thymine, respectively defines these two nucleotides at the 3' position, defining a sequence that overlaps into the subsite of any zinc finger that may be attached <b>N-terminally.</b>|$|E
50|$|RVD-Hpα is an {{endogenous}} neuropeptide {{found in}} human and mammalian brain, which was originally proposed {{to act as}} a selective agonist for the CB1 cannabinoid receptor. It is a 12-amino acid polypeptide having the amino acid sequence Arg-Val-Asp-Pro-Val-Asn-Phe-Lys-Leu-Leu-Ser-His and is an N-terminal extended form of hemopressin, a 9-AA polypeptide derived from the α1 subunit of hemoglobin which has previously been shown {{to act as a}} CB1 inverse agonist. All three polypeptides have been isolated from various mammalian species, with RVD-Hpα being one of the more abundant neuropeptides expressed in mouse brain, and these neuropeptides represent a new avenue for cannabinoid research distinct from the previously known endogenous lipid-derived cannabinoid agonists such as anandamide.

50|$|Kisspeptin is {{a product}} of the KISS1 gene, which is cleaved from an initial 145 amino acid peptide to a 54 amino acid long protein. This gene is located on the long arm of {{chromosome}} 1 (1q32) and has four exons of which the 5' and 3' exons only partly undergo translation. The KISS1 gene was first isolated as a tumor spreading gene by investigators and named metastin. Metastin is derived from the protein kisspeptin and is a natural ligand of the receptor known as GPR54 Kisspeptin expression in the brain: Catalyst for the initiation of puberty. Different types made up of 14 and 13 amino acids have been isolated and they each share a common C-terminal sequence. These <b>N-terminally</b> truncated peptides are known as the kisspeptins and belong to a larger family of peptides known as RFamides which all share a common arginine-phenylalanine-NH2 motif at their C-terminus. Among these conserved amino acids are arginine and phenylalanine residues, which are paired in this family of peptides. Also within this conserved family is a C-terminus that has an amide added to it. This family which kisspeptin includes prolactin releasing peptide and gonadotropin releasing inhibiting hormone.|$|E

A conserved glycine in a beta bulge in HNP2 was replaced with a series of D-amino acids resulting in VCC activity proportional to side chain hydrophobicity and charge. [...] VCC showed that <b>N-terminally</b> acetylated and/or C-terminally amidated HNP2 activity is proportional to electrostatic charge. VCC results were again proportional to charge for a series of salt bridge-disrupting mutants, suggesting that the salt bridge is not required for HNP2 function. [...] VCC measured the importance of N-terminal natural and artificial pro segments of the propeptide HNP1, dramatically altering activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. [...] Enantiomer forms of HNP1, HNP4, HD5 and the beta defensin HBD2 composed entirely of D-amino acids suggested differing mechanisms of defensin activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. [...] VCC results of dimerization-impaired monomer and tethered dimer forms of HNP1 demonstrated the importance of dimerization. [...] Replacing the conserved glycine with L-alanine resulted in subtle VCC differences.

In {{this study we}} show that the in vitro degradation of a polypeptide encompassing Melan-A(26 / 27 - 35) by proteasomes produces both the final antigenic peptide and <b>N-terminally</b> extended intermediates. When human melanoma cells expressing the corresponding fragments were exposed to specific CTL, those expressing the minimal antigenic sequence were recognized more efficiently than those expressing the <b>N-terminally</b> extended intermediates. Using a tumor-reactive CTL clone, we confirmed that the recognition of melanoma cells expressing an <b>N-terminally</b> extended intermediate of Melan-A is inefficient. We demonstrated that the inefficient cytosolic trimming of <b>N-terminally</b> extended intermediates could offer a selective advantage for the preferred presentation of Melan-A peptides directly produced by the proteasomes. These results imply that both the proteasomes and postproteasomal peptidases limit the availability of antigenic peptides and that the efficiency of presentation may be affected by conditions that alter the ratio between fully and partially processed proteasomal products...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe neuropathological {{hallmarks}} of Alzheimer's disease include extracellular neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The neuritic plaques contain β-amyloid peptides (Aβ peptides) {{as the major}} proteinaceous constituent and are surrounded by activated microglia and astrocytes as well as dystrophic neurites. <b>N-terminally</b> truncated forms of Aβ peptides are highly prevalent in neuritic plaques, including Aβ 3 -x beginning at Glu eventually modified to pyroglutamate (Aβ N 3 pE-x), Aβ 2 -x, Aβ 4 -x, and Aβ 5 -x. The precise origin of the different <b>N-terminally</b> modified Aβ peptides currently remains unknown. To assess the contribution of specific cell types {{to the formation of}} different <b>N-terminally</b> truncated Aβ peptides, supernatants from serum-free primary cell cultures of chicken neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, as well as human astrocytes, were analyzed by Aβ-ELISA and one- and two-dimensional SDS-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblot analysis. To evaluate the contribution of β- and γ-secretase to the generation of <b>N-terminally</b> modified Aβ, cultured astrocytes were treated with membrane-anchored “tripartite β-secretase (BACE 1) inhibitors” and the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT. Neurons, astrocytes, and microglia each exhibited cell type-specific patterns of secreted Aβ peptides. Neurons predominantly secreted Aβ peptides that begin at Asp 1, whereas those released from astrocytes and microglia included high proportions of <b>N-terminally</b> modified Aβ peptides, presumably including Aβ 2 / 3 -x and 4 / 5 -x.

40|$|Infection {{with any}} one of three strains of mouse scrapie prion (PrPSc), 139 A, ME 7, or 22 L, results in the {{accumulation}} of two underglycosylated, full-length PrP species and an <b>N-terminally</b> truncated PrP species that are not detectable in uninfected animals. The levels of the <b>N-terminally</b> truncated PrP species vary depending on PrPSc strain. Furthermore, 22 L-infected brains consistently have {{the highest levels of}} proteinase K (PK) -resistant PrP species, followed by ME 7 - and 139 A-infected brains. The three strains of PrPSc are equally susceptible to PK and proteases papain and chymotrypsin. Their protease resistance patterns are also similar. In sucrose gradient velocity sedimentation, the aberrant PrP species partition with PrPSc aggregates, indicating that they are physically associated with PrPSc. In ME 7 -infected animals, one of the underglycosylated, full-length PrP species is detected much earlier than the other, before both the onset of clinical disease and the detection of PK-resistant PrP species. In contrast, the appearance of the <b>N-terminally</b> truncated PrP species coincides with the presence of PK-resistant species and the manifestation of clinical symptoms. Therefore, accumulation of the underglycosylated, full-length PrP species is an early biochemical fingerprint of PrPSc infection. Accumulation of the underglycosylated, full-length PrP species and the aberrant <b>N-terminally</b> truncated PrP species may be important in the pathogenesis of prion disease...|$|E

Here we optimised a novel peptide IEF fractionation method for use prior to LC-MS/MS analysis in order to obtain a more in depth coverage of <b>N-terminally</b> acetylated proteins from complex samples. Application of the method to the analysis of the serous ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR- 5 identified 341 <b>N-terminally</b> acetylated proteins, 23 of which are previously un-reported.

40|$|Flavoprotein monooxygenases are {{involved}} {{in a wide variety of}} biological oxidations due to their ability to utilize organic flavin cofactors as substrates to stereo- and regioslectively produce valuable bioactive compounds. Metabolism of styrene by Pseudomonas putida (S 12) bacteria is accomplished by a two-component flavoenzyme system, which consists of styrene monooxygenase A (SMOA) and styrene monooxygenase B (SMOB), a reductase. Our present research evaluates the catalytic mechanisms of an <b>N-terminally</b> histidine-tagged version of the styrene monooxygenase reductase (NSMOB) component. Fluorescence monitored titrations at 4 ??C confirmed the equilibrium dissociation constant of NSMOB to have a Kd value of 50 nM, an order of magnitude greater than the wild-type reductase. Steady-state kinetic analysis at 30 ??C also determined that a double-displacement mechanism with NADH as the leading substrate is the preferred method of FAD reduction. Due to the significant change in FAD binding affinity and catalytic mechanism, stopped-flow fluorescence and absorbance was used to evaluate the pre-steady state kinetics of NSMOB. We determined that the hydride-transfer rate constant is k = 48 s- 1, which is identical to the wild-type enzyme at k = 50 s- 1 at 15 ??C, which effectively resolves the rate-limiting step for the <b>N-terminally</b> tagged enzyme.

TOAC replaced Asp(1) (TOAC(1) -AII) and Val(3) (TOAC(3) -AII) in AII and was inserted prior to Arg(1) (TOAC(0) -BK) and replacing Pro(3) (TOAC(3) -BK) in BK. the peptide conformational properties were examined {{as a function}} of trifluoroethanol (TFE) content and pH. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra were sensitive to both variables and showed that internally labeled analogues yielded rotational correlation times (tau(C)) considerably larger than <b>N-terminally</b> labeled ones, evincing the greater freedom of motion of the N-terminus. in TFE, tau(C) increased due to viscosity effects. Calculation of tau(Cpeptide) / tau(CTOAC) ratios indicated that the peptides acquired more folded conformations. Circular dichroism spectra showed that, except for TOAC(1) -AII in TFE, the <b>N-terminally</b> labeled analogues displayed a conformational behavior {{similar to that of the}} parent peptides. in contrast, under all conditions, the TOAC(3) derivatives acquired more restricted conformations. Fluorescence spectra of AII and its derivatives were especially sensitive to the ionization of Tyr(4). Fluorescence quenching by the nitroxide moiety was much more pronounced for TOAC(3) -AII. the conformational behavior of the TOAC derivatives bears excellent correlation with their biological activity, since, while the <b>N-terminally</b> labeled peptides were partially active, their internally labeled counterparts were inactive [Nakaie, C.

Native data sets for both triclinic and the orthorhombic crystals were collected at 1. 7 and 2. 0 A ̊ resolution, respectively. Enzyme activity assays, pH and temperature optima show comparable values for both the full-length and the <b>N-terminally</b> truncated GTF 180...|$|E
40|$|Two dipeptides {{containing}} an <b>N-terminally</b> positioned omega-amino acid residue (beta-alanine/delta-amino valeric acid) self-assembles to form nanotubes in {{the solid}} state {{as well as}} in aqueous solution. In spite of having hollow nanotubular structures in the solid state and in solution, their self-assembling nature in these two states are different and this leads to the formation of different internal diameters of these nanotubes in solution and in solid state structure. These nanotubes are stable proteolytically, thermally, and over a wide range of pH values (1 - 13). The role of water molecules in nanotube formation has been investigated in the solid state. These nanotubes can be considered as a new class of dipeptide nanotubes as they are consisting of <b>N-terminally</b> located protease resistant omega-amino acid residues and C-terminally positioned alpha-amino acid residues. These dipeptides can form an interesting class of short peptidic structure that can give rise to stable nanotubular structure upon self-assembly and these nanotubes can be explored in future for potential nanotechnological applications...|$|E
