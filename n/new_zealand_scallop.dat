40|$|Abstract This paper {{explores the}} {{economic}} {{performance of a}} fishery that operates under an individual transferable quota (ITQs) management system and that is subject to an in-season stock externality. While Boyce (1992) and others have established theoretically that ITQ management is not fully efficient under all conditions, {{this is the first}} study that empirically estimates the efficiency losses due to an in-season stock externality in an actual fishery. We study the <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> southern <b>scallop</b> fishery, which has been under ITQ management since 1992. Our analysis provides evidence of a race-to-fish in the fishery, and estimates that individual firm profits were approximately $ 2, 300 and $ 2, 000 (20 % and 10 %) less in 1996 and 1997, respectively, than they would have been under optimal management. We recommend modifications in the ITQ policy to improve the economic performance of the fishery.

40|$|Research PaperScallop {{fisheries}} {{are often}} characterized by variable abundance and periodic mass mortality occurrences. Area rotation is a respected management tool for sedentary species. A bioeconomic simulation model that incorporates the {{spatial and temporal}} distribution of scallop beds and fishing effort is presented. The model is user-friendly and was designed for use by fisheries managers and shareholders of the <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> Challenger <b>Scallop</b> Enhancement Company Inc. The model combines twenty-one biological models representing rotated and enhanced subareas of various size and productivity, with economics of the scallop fishery. The bioeconomic simulation model is used to evaluate various management strategies including geographic area rotation, daily catch limitations and fleet size. Results indicate that a mixed rotation schedule is optimal but that subarea specific growth rate {{studies are needed to}} implement it. Results also indicate that vessels numbers may be higher than needed to take the same amount of fish and that low daily catch limits result in the highest level of NPV but increase effort. In addition, the model is used to evaluate the impact of various types of mass mortality occurrences on the net present value of individual quota under two different rotation schedule scenarios. These simulations suggest that the relatively shorter rotation schedule is preferable in that {{the time it takes to}} recover from a mass mortality occurrence is shorter than otherwise. Future research endeavors are described. This research is expected to be useful to scallop and other sedentary species-based fisheries considering area rotation as a key management tool...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} investigates seasonality, stock depletion and {{the protection}} of marine mammals using bioeconomic analysis. Seasonality reflects the availability of a renewable resource during different times of the year, and stock depletion refers to the removal rate of a renewable resource. The effects of these two components are explored under open access, optimal exploitation and individual transferable quota (ITQ) systems. ^ This dissertation is composed of three manuscripts. The first manuscript develops a theoretical model that explores seasonality and seasonal stock depletion within a single species, single fleet, and single fishery under open access conditions with constant and variable price. It is then expanded to a multifleet, multi-species scenario. Optimal exploitation and individual transferable quota (ITQs) are then investigated under seasonality and stock effects. ^ In the second manuscript, an estimate of the efficiency losses due to stock depletion {{during the course of the}} year in the New Zealand southern scallop fishery is made, which has been under ITQ management since 1992. A “race-to-fish” behavior is observed in the southern <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>scallop</b> fishery. The analysis shows that if there is a lame stock depletion ITQs are not optimal. If the stock depletion is negligible, ITQs are optimal. Theoretical and empirical results of the first two manuscripts show ITQs are sub-optimal to the optimal exploitation model when there is a seasonal stock depletion. ^ Finally in the third manuscript, the biological and economic consequences of season area closures are compared to marine mammal ITQs. The results of a case study of the New England sink gillnet fishery show, ITQs for marine mammals are economically more efficient than season area closures in reducing the total harbor porpoise take. Profits under ITQs are 2 – 16 % greater than closures. Effort and profit reductions under ITQ management are spread more evenly across seasons and ports compared to closure management. ...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge {{about the}} {{population}} genetic structure of species and the factors shaping such patterns {{is crucial for}} effective management and conservation. The complexity of New Zealand’s marine environment presents a challenge for management and the classification of its marine biogeographic areas. As such, {{it is an interesting}} system to investigate marine connectivity dynamics and the evolutionary processes shaping the population structure of marine species. An accurate description of spatial and temporal patterns of dispersal and population structure requires the use of tools capable of incorporating the variability of the mechanisms involved. However, these techniques are yet to be broadly applied to New Zealand marine organisms. This study used genetic markers to assess the genetic variation of the endemic <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>scallop,</b> Pecten novaezelandiae, at different spatial and temporal scales. A multidisciplinary approach was used integrating genetic with environmental data (seascape genetics) and hydrodynamic modelling tools. P. novaezelandiae supports important commercial, recreational and customary fisheries but there is no previous information about its genetic structure. Therefore, twelve microsatellite markers were developed for this study (Chapter 2). Samples (n= 952) were collected from 15 locations to determine the genetic structure across the distribution range of P. novaezelandiae. The low genetic structure detected in this study is expected given the recent evolutionary history, the large reproductive potential and the pelagic larval duration of the species (approximately 3 weeks). A significant isolation by distance signal and a degree of differentiation from north to south was apparent, but this structure conflicted with some evidence of panmixia. A latitudinal genetic diversity gradient was observed that might reflect the colonisation and extinction events and insufficient time to reach migration-drift equilibrium during a recent range expansion (Chapter 3). A seascape genetic approach was used to test for associations between patterns of genetic variation in P. novaezelandiae and environmental variables (three geospatial and six environmental variables). Although the geographic distance between populations was an important variable explaining the genetic variation among populations, it appears that levels of genetic differentiation are not a simple function of distance. Evidence suggests that some environmental factors such as freshwater discharge and suspended particulate matter can be contributing to the patterns of genetic differentiation of P. novaezelandiae in New Zealand (Chapter 4). Dispersal of P. novaezelandiae was investigated at a small spatial and temporal scale in the Coromandel fishery using genetic markers integrated with hydrodynamic modelling. For the spatial analysis, samples (n= 402) were collected in 2012 from 5 locations and for the temporal analysis samples (n= 383) were collected in 2012 and 2014 from 3 locations. Results showed small but significant spatial and temporal genetic differentiation, suggesting that the Coromandel fishery does not form a single panmictic unit with free gene flow and supporting a model of source-sink population dynamics (Chapter 5). The importance of using multidisciplinary approaches at different spatial and temporal scales is widely recognized as a means to better understand the complex processes affecting marine connectivity. The outcomes of this study highlight the importance of incorporating these different approaches, provide vital information to assist in effective management and conservation of P. novaezelandiae and contribute to our understanding of evolutionary processes shaping population structure of marine species...|$|E
40|$|The <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>scallop</b> Pecten novaezelandiae is an {{important}} fishery. Wild scallop spat are used extensively to enhance and maintain scallop beds. The current yields of scallops have decreased by over a third in the last decade. A potential solution to increasing the scallop yield and conserving stocks are hatchery grown spat. Most studies related to P. novaezelandiae have concentrated on their ecology and the process and effects of scallop enhancement. This study aimed to fill two gaps in our knowledge of P. novaezelandiae biology by exploring the effects of diet ration on the animal’s gonad maturation and to characterise the larval development from zygote to pedivileger. Wild scallops were collected and maintained in the laboratory for seven days and fed ad libitum. An initial sample of scallops was taken and reproductive condition was {{compared to that of}} scallops fed one of three algal diets for thirty days: The diet rations were 0. 5 g (low), 0. 92 g (medium) and 1. 9 g (high) of microalgae per day. The results of the study showed there was {{a significant increase in the}} gonadalsomatic index (ANOVA; F 3 = 49. 3; p< 0. 05; n= 91), wet gonad weight (Steel, p< 0. 05), egg size (ANOVA, F 3 = 2. 8; p< 0. 05; n= 3773) and colour between the male and female portions of the gonad (p< 0. 05; n= 117). However, colour, wet gonad weight and acini area were not significantly different after 30 days of conditioning. Three lots of scallops were spawned to characterise the key phases of P. novaezelandiae from zygote to pedivileger. Two spawnings characterised P. novaezelandiae from gamete to D-larvae. The embryos were cultured in 900 ml of fresh sea water, filtered to one micron for 3 days and sampled randomly. There was 100 % mortality by day four. The third spawning saw fertilised eggs placed in a 170 L conical tank for three days. The D-larvae were then transferred to six Cawthron Ultra Dense Larval rearing systems (CUDLs), from which larvae were selected every two days for imaging with Light Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy. A strong linear growth for P. novaezelandiae larvae diameter corresponded to 6. 5895 × age in days + 74. 337. A mean growth of 5. 92 µm a day was experienced over 30 days for P. novaezelandiae larvae. A mean (±SE) clearance 65. 4 ± 2. 59 % of the Chlorophyll A was cleared per day over 30 days of feeding. P. novaezelandiae sperm morphology, 2. 14 ± 0. 05 length and 61 ± 0. 07 µm breadth, is similar to the Pecten maximus. Unknown micropores are visible on the nucleus of the sperm. P. novaezelandiae eggs are spawned with irregular shapes and experience meiosis in the first hour. A polar body emerges 15 min after fertilisation. The embryogenesis of P. novaezelandiae is similar to other scallop bivalves comprising of a polar lobed, cleavage, cell division, blastula, gastrula and trochophore phases. D-larvae emerge after three days. However, an umbo veliger phase is not obvious and only emerges before around when an eyespot is visible around 23 days post fertilisation [PF]. Approximately 30 days PF a pedivileger emerges. This is the first study in broodstock P. novaezelandiae, and which characterises key growth phases. It is also the first time semi quantitative colour measures have been conducted on the diet concentration of the gonad. Spawning was found to be a barrier to successfully spawning large quantities of scallops...|$|E
40|$|The New Zealand native scallop, Pecten novaezelandiae, is {{a species}} {{with a high}} {{economic}} value as a wild catch and has good potential for cultivation. As a mean to enhance {{the future of this}} growing shellfish industry, this thesis set out to investigate the nutritional requirements of P. novaezelandiae in relation to reproductive conditions, and determined the physical and biological factors that affect the condition of this scallop species in the wild and cultivated environments. Adult scallops (Pecten novaezelandiae) were sampled from six populations in the Hauraki Gulf (Auckland, New Zealand) in the spawning season (October 2014), in order to evaluate the scallop reproductive condition and nutritional state across the populations. Results showed a spatial variation in reproduction condition (VGI and gonad index), with a higher number of mature scallops in populations closer to the shoreline, where higher food availability may be found. Conversely, nutrient content in scallop somatic tissues (adductor muscle carbohydrates and digestive gland lipids) did not vary across the populations, but was strongly associated with reproductive status of individual scallops (VGI). Nutrient (carbohydrates, proteins and lipids) storage and utilization were investigated within scallops from two sites in the Hauraki Gulf, bi-monthly over a year (2012 − 2013). In addition, sediment samples were also taken to evaluate the potential for re-suspended nutrients as a food source for scallops. Water samples were collected for seston and chlorophyll a analyses. Isotope analyses (carbon and nitrogen) and proximate analyses were conducted for the gonad, adductor muscle and digestive gland of wild P. novaezelandiae, sediment samples and the seston (1. 2 − 5 μm, > 5 μm). Isotope analyses revealed distinctly different signatures in suspended sediment and scallop tissues, indicating that re-suspended nutrients were unlikely to contribute to the diet of scallops. Nevertheless, seston (particularly the small fractions) signatures were closely related to scallop tissue samples, suggesting that {{it is likely to be}} the main food source for the wild P. novaezelandiae. Scallops from the two sampling sites exhibited similar reproductive cycles and utilization of nutrients. Gametogenesis started in winter, and took place at the expense of carbohydrates stored in adductor muscles. Spawning events were recorded in spring (October−November) and summer (January−March), and the energy demand required during spawning events was supported by digestive gland protein. Gonad re-maturation between spring and summer spawnings were supported by the utilization of digestive gland lipids. The reproductive condition and nutrient content of scallops were then studied during the spawning season (October 2013) in wild populations and within experimental conditions (fed with a commercial microalgal diet; Shellfish Diet 1800 ®) in an aquaculture laboratory, in order to identify condition and nutrient requirements for scallop cultivation in New Zealand. Field scallops (feeding on natural food sources) spawned just before the end of the experiment, while experimental animals reached gonad maturity at the end of the experiment, but did not spawn. The trend in gonad maturation for field and experimental animals indicates that there was a lag time of about 2 weeks, and that this lag is likely due to nutritional stress associated with the shift from natural food sources to the mixed microalgal formulated diet provided in the laboratory. Results indicate that experimental scallops had lower nutrient (carbohydrates, protein, lipids and total energy) reserves stored in adductor muscle tissues compared to wild animals, but both field and experimental animals utilized muscular reserves (especially carbohydrates and protein) to support reproductive activity. The fatty acid profiles revealed that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were found in significantly lower quantities in gonad tissues of scallops from the laboratory compared to those in the field. This thesis shows that P. novaezelandiae utilizes energy reserves from both adductor muscle and digestive gland to cover the full cost of gametogenesis. In addition, cultivation environments using microalgal diets are conducive to condition P. novaezelandiae, but the optimal nutrient requirements for an efficient aquaculture production of this species needs further investigation. It is recommended by this thesis that future investigation on the conditioning requirements for P. novaezelandiae will be the next step for <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>scallop</b> fisheries...|$|E
