40|$|A 2 -year-old male <b>neutered</b> <b>cat</b> {{presented}} for further investigation of biliothorax. The cat was initially treated for pyothorax, including bilateral chest drains for lavage of the pleural space. Five days later, the pleural effusion turned clear-yellow {{and had a}} bilirubin concentration of 427 mmol/l compared to the serum bilirubin concentration of 15 mmol/l. Exploratory surgery revealed a 2 mm tear in the diaphragm, with a corresponding 2 mm defect in the diaphragmatic surface of the gall bladder, creating a fistula between the gall bladder and the pleural cavity. The defects were repaired routinely and the cat made a full recovery. It was suspected that the tears had been created {{at the time of}} the thoracostomy tube placement.

40|$|A 7 -month-old male <b>neutered</b> <b>cat</b> was {{referred}} for paraparesis and painful sensation {{at the level}} of T 13 vertebra where a dermal cyst was observed. Spine radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a well-encapsulated cyst communicating with the meninges and spinal cord, suggestive of hydromyelia and myelodysplasia. Dorsal laminectomy was performed and the cyst was completely removed. The day after surgery, the cat was ambulatory paraparetic. Involuntary defecation was observed for only a few days. The surgical specimen was cystic and covered by skin. Microscopic examination revealed a hollow hemispheric mass of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) -positive neural tissue lined by ependyma and formed of glia and vascular structures consistent with myelomeningocele (MMC). Only anecdotal descriptions of MMC have been published in the veterinary literature, mainly in the lumbosacral spinal cord.

40|$|Meningioma is {{the most}} {{frequently}} observed primary brain tumour in cats. Usually, it is associated with an intracranial expansion with consequent brain compression, oedema and brain herniation. Typical features of feline intracranial meningiomas are hyperostosis of the adjacent bone and intratumoral mineralisation. We describe a 13 -year-old male <b>neutered</b> <b>cat</b> with a 1 -year history of behavioural change. At clinical and neurological examination the cat showed signs consistent with right-sided forebrain lesion. Magnetic resonance images showed a right-sided extra-axial contrast enhancing mass {{in the region of}} the frontotemporal lobe. The overlying bone of the calvarium showed a marked defect with extracranial expansion of the tissue. Surgery was performed and the tumour could be exposed by a right-sided temporal approach. After extension of the bony defect the mass could be removed properly. The cat recovered well from surgery and a 12 -month follow-up showed no persistent neurological deficits. Histopathological assessment of the tumour revealed a transitional grade 1 meningioma. Despite osteolysis and extracranial expansion of the tumour differentials should include menigioma in feline intracranial neoplasms...|$|E
40|$|Degenerative {{joint disease}} of the {{vertebral}} column can be divided in two types of degeneration. First there is degeneration of the intervertebral joints resulting in osteophyte formation, named spondylosis deformans. Second there is degeneration of the synovial facet articulations between vertebrae, named osteoarthritis. There are a few reports of spondylosis deformans in cats, but no reports of osteoarthritis of the facet articulations of the vertebral column. This literature review describes what is currently known about these two conditions considering prevalence, pathogenesis, clinical symptoms, diagnostic possibilities, radiographic symptoms and therapeutical options. Evaluation of the prevalence of osteoarthritis in the facet articulations of the vertebral column and spondylosis deformans of the vertebral column on radiographs from {{the archives of the}} Division of Diagnostic Imaging of the University Clinic for Companion Animals in Utrecht was performed. In total, 471 radiographs were evaluated for facet arthritis and spondylosis deformans. For each case the age, breed, weight, gender and disease for which the cat was presented were assessed. This research was done to learn more about risk factors and prevalence of facet osteoarthritis and spondylosis deformans in cats referred to the university clinic in the Netherlands. Frequency tables were made of all assessed variables. Logistic regression was performed per intervertebral space to evaluate putative risk factors (i. e. breed, gender, age, weight, trauma and diagnosis) in the development of spondylosis deformans in cats. Also prevalence of spondylosis per intervertebral space was calculated. Spondylosis deformans was related to age in most intervertebral spaces. An older cat has increased odds for having spondylosis than a younger cat. Spondylosis at two intervertebral spaces was related to gender. A female <b>neutered</b> <b>cat</b> has higher odds of developing spondylosis, compared to a male <b>neutered</b> <b>cat.</b> Spondylosis at one intervertebral space was related to weight. Occurrence of spondylosis was not related to disease and breed. Least spondylosis was found in the cervical region of the spine, and somewhat more was found in the lumbar region of the spine. Most spondylosis was found in the thoracic region of the spine with a peak incidence between Th 5 -Th 10. Most bridges were seen in the late-thoracic and early-lumbar part (Th 10 -L 2) of the spine. Early-to-middle thoracic region (Th 1 -Th 10) was most frequently affected by small spurs and tooth-like shapes. Of the 471 evaluated radiographs, only six cats were found positive for facet osteoarthritis over some intervertebral spaces...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A 4 -year-old, male, <b>neutered</b> <b>cat</b> was {{referred}} because of recurrent episodes of dyspnea. Physical examination revealed a harsh systolic murmur, {{with the point}} of maximal intensity in the left heart base, with an intensity of 4 out of 6. Echocardiographic diagnosis was severe supravalvular pulmonary artery stenosis. A selective right ventricular angiocardiogram showed an absence of arterial {{blood flow to the}} left lung lobes. A balloon dilatation of the localized stenosis of the right pulmonary artery was attempted with cardiac catheterization. However, when the catheter was passed through the stenosis, the blood flow to the lungs temporarily completely ceased, which led to death. Postmortem examination revealed a circumscribed stenosis of both pulmonary arteries {{at the site of the}} bifurcation, where the ligamentum arteriosum was attached. Histopathology showed that the localized ridge-like stenosis at the pulmonary artery bifurcation was caused by connective tissue. The suspected cause of this congenital anomaly is the presence of ectopic ductal tissue in the wall of the pulmonary artery. When the ductus arteriosus closes at birth, pulmonary artery stenosis developed because of constriction of the ectopic ductal tissue...|$|E
40|$|A 2. 5 -year-old, male, <b>neutered</b> <b>cat</b> {{presented}} with a 5 -month history of progressive right hind limb lameness and an enlarged right popliteal lymph node. Radiographs revealed significant bony lysis of the tarsus and distal tibia, and fine-needle aspirate of the bone lesion and lymph node revealed a neoplastic population of cells with uncertain origin. Amputation was elected, and the mass was submitted for histology and cellular culture for better characterization. Histologic examination revealed a mixture of spindle-shaped cells and larger, round to polygonal cells. All cells were immunoreactive for vimentin, and only the larger polygonal cells were also positive for cytokeratin. All cells were negative for desmin, smooth muscle actin, cluster of differentiation (CD) 3, CD 18, CD 79 a, macrophage antibody (MAC) 387, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Cultured neoplastic cells failed to express CD 18, and {{were not able to}} secrete the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) β, and IL- 6 when stimulated by lipopolysaccharide, disproving that the cells originated from the macrophage or monocyte line. Ultrastructurally, neoplastic cells were characterized by abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum, interdigitating cellular processes, and membrane condensations. Based on location and cytologic, histologic, ultrastructural, and functional studies, this neoplasm was considered a synovial cell sarcoma...|$|E
40|$|Free-roaming cat {{populations are}} {{abundant}} in many urban ecosystems worldwide. Their management {{is necessary for}} reasons of public health, risk of wildlife predation and cat welfare related to their high densities. Trap-neuter-return (TNR) programs are now the main cat population control strategy in urban areas. However, the efficacy of such strategies is difficult to evaluate without more precise estimates of cat numbers and a better knowledge of anthropogenic influences on cat densities. Aims. We aimed to estimate free-roaming cat population numbers and density in residential neighbourhoods in Tel Aviv, and to investigate population densities in relation to several socio-demographic factors. Methods. We compared free-roaming cat population densities in terms of neighbourhood socio-economic status (SES), housing type, human density and percentage of residential and commercial areas. Five consecutive cat density surveys were carried out in eight residential neighbourhoods in Israel - four in northern Tel Aviv, characterised by high SES, and four in southern Tel Aviv, characterised by low SES. The photographic capture-recapture technique was used and abundance estimates were evaluated using the MARK program. Regression analyses examined the effect of socio-demographic factors on cat densities. Key results. Neighbourhood socio-economic status significantly influenced kitten density and proportion of neutered cats in the total population: southern neighbourhoods had higher kitten densities and lower <b>neutered</b> <b>cat</b> proportions compared with northern neighbourhoods. Higher adult cat densities featured in mixed profile neighbourhoods of residential and commercial areas compared with solely residential neighbourhoods. Using the linear equation from the regression analysis the entire free-roaming cat population in Tel Aviv was extrapolated to 39 000 cats. Conclusions. The results suggest that adult cat and kitten densities depend in part on socio-demographic factors, specifically on neighbourhood socio-economic status {{and the proportion of}} residential area. Implications. Our findings in Tel Aviv may be used to improve cat management efforts, by focusing on neighbourhoods hosting higher cat densities; as well as to improve cat welfare by focusing on neighbourhoods with lower neutering rates and higher kitten densities. Finally, the current study may serve as a basis for studies in other cities with similar cat overpopulation problems...|$|E
