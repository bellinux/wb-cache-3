5|$|The {{expected}} future {{course of}} the disease depends on the subtype of the disease; the individual's sex, age, and initial symptoms; {{and the degree of}} disability the person has. Female sex, relapsing-remitting subtype, optic <b>neuritis</b> or sensory symptoms at onset, few attacks in the initial years and especially early age at onset, are associated with a better course.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation (hypoesthesia), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, impaired movement, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as dysarthria) or swallowing (dysphagia), visual problems (nystagmus, optic <b>neuritis,</b> or diplopia), fatigue and acute or chronic pain syndromes, bladder and bowel difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptoms (mainly depression). At the same time for each symptom there are different treatment options. Treatments should therefore be individualized depending both on {{the patient and the}} physician.|$|E
5|$|The 1926 tour of England {{would be}} Collins's last. Partly {{as a result}} of a wet English summer, the first four Tests of the five-Test series ended in draws. Collins had a disappointing tour, {{suffering}} from <b>neuritis</b> and in constant pain from arthritis. He missed the Third and Fourth Tests when admitted to hospital but recovered to resume his place as captain for the Fifth Test.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{physicians}} thought low back pain was caused by inflammation of or damage to the nerves, with neuralgia and <b>neuritis</b> frequently mentioned by them in the medical literature of the time. The popularity of such proposed causes decreased during the 20th century. In the early 20th century, American neurosurgeon Harvey Williams Cushing increased the acceptance of surgical treatments for low back pain. In the 1920s and 1930s, new theories of the cause arose, with physicians proposing a combination of nervous system and psychological disorders such as nerve weakness (neurasthenia) and female hysteria. Muscular rheumatism (now called fibromyalgia) was also cited with increasing frequency.|$|E
5|$|In the 1929 season, Pennock saw his {{pitching}} {{time and}} pitching quality diminish. Over {{the rest of}} his career, he never posted more than 189 innings pitched in a season and his ERA rose to over 4.00. He suffered from bouts of <b>neuritis</b> in 1929 and 1930. Pennock won his 200th career game during the 1929 season, becoming the third left-handed pitcher to reach that mark. He led the AL in walks per nine innings pitched in 1930 (1.151) and 1931 (1.426). Pennock pitched four innings of relief against the Chicago Cubs in the 1932 World Series, recording two saves. The New York chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America named him their player of the year.|$|E
5|$|Krueger came to {{feel that}} the {{prospects}} for promotion in the infantry were very poor, and in 1927 he tried to transfer to the United States Army Air Corps. He attended the Air Corps Primary Flying School at Brooks Field, Texas, but suffered an attack of <b>neuritis</b> in his right arm, and his flight instructor, Lieutenant Claire Lee Chennault, failed him. In December 1927, he was offered a position as an instructor at the Naval War College, where he taught classes on World War I, and on joint operations.|$|E
5|$|A {{person with}} MS can have almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms {{are determined by the}} locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic <b>neuritis</b> or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.|$|E
5|$|Pain: {{acute pain}} is mainly due to optic <b>neuritis</b> (with {{corticosteroids}} {{being the best}} treatment available), as well as trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte's sign, or dysesthesias. Subacute pain is usually secondary to the disease and can be a consequence of spending too long in the same position, urinary retention, and infected skin ulcers, amongst others. Treatment will depend on cause. Chronic pain is very common and harder to treat as its most common cause is dysesthesias. Acute pain due to trigeminal neuralgia is usually successfully treated with anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or phenytoin. Both Lhermitte's sign and painful dysesthesias usually respond to treatment with carbamazepine, clonazepam, or amitriptyline. Sativex is approved for treatment of pain in MS in different countries, but due to its derivation from cannabis, it is currently not available in others, such as the USA. This medication is also being investigated {{for the management of}} other MS symptoms, such as spasticity, and has shown long-term safety and efficacy.|$|E
5|$|There were {{professional}} {{musicians in}} the previous three generations of Holst's family {{and it was clear}} from his early years that he would follow the same calling. He hoped to become a pianist, but was prevented by <b>neuritis</b> in his right arm. Despite his father's reservations, he pursued a career as a composer, studying at the Royal College of Music under Charles Villiers Stanford. Unable to support himself by his compositions, he played the trombone professionally and later became a teacher—a great one, according to his colleague Ralph Vaughan Williams. Among other teaching activities he built up a strong tradition of performance at Morley College, where he served as musical director from 1907 until 1924, and pioneered music education for women at St Paul's Girls' School, where he taught from 1905 until his death in 1934. He was the founder of a series of Whitsun music festivals, which ran from 1916 for the remainder of his life.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} {{begins in}} 85% of cases as a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) {{over a number}} of days with 45% having motor or sensory problems, 20% having optic <b>neuritis,</b> and 10% having symptoms related to brainstem dysfunction, while the remaining 25% have more than one of the previous difficulties. The course of symptoms occurs in two main patterns initially: either as episodes of sudden worsening that last a few days to months (called relapses, exacerbations, bouts, attacks, or flare-ups) followed by improvement (85% of cases) or as a gradual worsening over time without periods of recovery (10–15% of cases). A combination of these two patterns may also occur or people may start in a relapsing and remitting course that then becomes progressive later on. Relapses are usually not predictable, occurring without warning. Exacerbations rarely occur more frequently than twice per year. Some relapses, however, are preceded by common triggers and they occur more frequently during spring and summer. Similarly, viral infections such as the common cold, influenza, or gastroenteritis increase their risk. Stress may also trigger an attack. Women with MS who become pregnant experience fewer relapses; however, during the first months after delivery the risk increases. Overall, pregnancy does not seem to influence long-term disability. Many events have been found not to affect relapse rates including vaccination, breast feeding, physical trauma, and Uhthoff's phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|The {{neurological}} {{manifestations of}} BYS were first described by Yoshinari et al. including patients with peripheral <b>neuritis,</b> meningitis and cranial <b>neuritis</b> (facial nerve palsy, diplopia and deafness).|$|E
25|$|There {{are reports}} that {{cataract}} may progress following HBOT. Also a rare side effect has been blindness secondary to optic <b>neuritis</b> (inflammation of the optic nerve).|$|E
25|$|Holst {{suffered}} <b>neuritis</b> in {{his right}} arm, which caused him to seek help from several amanuenses in scoring The Planets. This {{is clear from the}} number of different hands apparent in the full score.|$|E
25|$|In March 1967, {{shortly before}} graduating from law school, McConnell {{enlisted in the}} U.S. Army Reserve at Louisville, Kentucky. In August 1967, after five weeks of {{military}} training at Fort Knox, he received an honorable discharge for medical reasons (optic <b>neuritis).</b>|$|E
25|$|Similar {{instances}} of optic <b>neuritis</b> and myelitis were reported, and many believed it constituted a distinct clinical entity. However, some patients had pathology {{in other parts}} of the brain, a feature which was more suggestive of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or MS.|$|E
25|$|Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), {{also known}} as Devic's disease or Devic's syndrome, is a {{heterogeneous}} condition consisting of the simultaneous inflammation and demyelination of the optic nerve (optic <b>neuritis)</b> and the spinal cord (myelitis). It can be monophasic or recurrent.|$|E
25|$|Tricyclic and dual serotonergic-noradrenergic reuptake {{inhibition}} by SNRIs (or SSRI-NRI combinations), {{have also}} shown analgesic properties additionally. According to recent evidences antidepressants {{also seem to}} exert beneficial effects in experimental autoimmune <b>neuritis</b> in rats by decreasing Interferon-beta (IFN-beta) release or augmenting NK activity in depressed patients.|$|E
25|$|A {{retrospective}} {{study found that}} prevalence of NMOsd was 1.5% inside {{a random sample of}} neurological patients, with a MS:NMOsd ratio of 42.7. Among 13 NMOsd patients, 77% had long spinal cord lesions, 38% had severe optic <b>neuritis</b> and 23% had brain or brainstem lesions. Only 56% had clinically definite NMO at follow-up.|$|E
25|$|Labyrinthitis {{presents}} {{with severe}} vertigo with associated nausea, vomiting, and generalized imbalance and {{is believed to}} be caused by a viral infection of the inner ear though several theories have been put forward and the cause remains uncertain. Individuals with vestibular <b>neuritis</b> do not typically have auditory symptoms but may experience a sensation of aural fullness or tinnitus. Persisting balance problems may remain in 30% of people affected.|$|E
25|$|The prodromal phase {{may have}} no symptoms, or may mimic a {{non-specific}} viral infection, marked by flu-like symptoms that typically last for a few days. There may be fever, headache, nausea, meningismus, dysacusia (discomfort caused by loud noises or a distortion {{in the quality of}} the sounds being heard), tinnitus, and/or vertigo. Eye symptoms can include orbital pain, photophobia and tearing. The skin and hair may be sensitive to touch. Cranial nerve palsies and optic <b>neuritis</b> are uncommon.|$|E
25|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE)* {{is a disease}} {{of the immune system}} characterized by the presence of antibodies to nucleic acid and/or antibodies to red blood cells, platelets, lymphocytes, clotting factors, and thyroglobulin. The disease can result in deposition of immune complexes or autoimmune disease. Immune complex deposition can cause vasculitis, meningitis, <b>neuritis,</b> and joint and skin disease. Autoimmune disease may result in hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia, which are the most common manifestations of SLE in dogs.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Kanehiro Takaki {{observed}} that Japanese sailors (whose diets consisted {{almost entirely of}} white rice) developed beriberi (or endemic <b>neuritis,</b> a disease causing heart problems and paralysis), but British sailors and Japanese naval officers did not. Adding various types of vegetables and meats to the diets of Japanese sailors prevented the disease, (not because of the increased protein as Takaki supposed but because it introduced a few parts per million of thiamine to the diet, later understood as a cure).|$|E
25|$|The main antithyroid {{drugs are}} {{carbimazole}} (in the UK), methimazole (in the US), and propylthiouracil/PTU. These drugs block the binding of iodine and coupling of iodotyrosines. The most dangerous side effect is agranulocytosis (1/250, more in PTU). Others include granulocytopenia (dose-dependent, which improves on cessation of the drug) and aplastic anemia. Patients on these medications {{should see a}} doctor if they develop sore throat or fever. The most common side effects are rash and peripheral <b>neuritis.</b> These drugs also cross the placenta and are secreted in breast milk. Lugol's iodine {{may be used to}} block hormone synthesis before surgery.|$|E
25|$|This ruling {{held that}} tetanus vaccine caused a {{particular}} case of optic <b>neuritis</b> even though no scientific evidence supported the petitioner's claim. Other rulings have allowed petitioners to gain awards for claims that the MMR vaccine causes fibromyalgia, that the Hib vaccine causes transverse myelitis, and that the hepatitis B vaccine causes Guillain–Barré syndrome, chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy, and multiple sclerosis. In the most extreme of these cases, a 2006 petitioner successfully claimed that a hepatitis B vaccine caused her multiple sclerosis despite several studies showing that the vaccine neither causes nor worsens the disease, and despite a conclusion by the Institute of Medicine that evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship.|$|E
25|$|Two pianos (duo) – Holst had {{originally}} sketched {{the work for}} two pianos, due to a need {{to compensate for the}} <b>neuritis</b> in his right arm. His two friends Nora Day, and Vally Lasker had agreed to play for him the two-piano arrangement as he dictated the details of the orchestral score to them. This they wrote down themselves on the two-piano score, and used as a guide {{when it was time to}} create the full orchestral score. The two-piano arrangement was published in 1949. Holst's original manuscripts for it are now in the holdings of the Royal College of Music (Mars, Venus, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune), Royal Academy of Music (Mercury) and British Library (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus).|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} some overlap between {{biological}} psychiatry and neurology, the latter generally focuses on disorders where gross or visible pathology {{of the nervous system}} is apparent, such as epilepsy, cerebral palsy, encephalitis, <b>neuritis,</b> Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. There is some overlap with neuropsychiatry, which typically deals with behavioral disturbances in the context of apparent brain disorder. In contrast biological psychiatry describes the basic principles and then delves deeper into various disorders. It is structured to follow the organisation of the DSM-IV, psychiatry's primary diagnostic and classification guide. The contributions of this field explore functional neuroanatomy, imaging and neuropsychology and pharmacotherapeutic possibilities for depression, anxiety and mood disorders, substance abuse and eating disorders, schizophrenia and psychotic disorders, and cognitive and personality disorders.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, he {{was often}} paired with Boris Karloff, {{who was able to}} demand top billing. To his frustration, Lugosi was {{increasingly}} restricted to minor parts, kept employed by the studio principally {{for the sake of his}} name on the posters. Among his pairings with Karloff, only in The Black Cat (1934), The Raven (1935), and Son of Frankenstein (1939) did he perform major roles again, and, even in The Raven, Karloff received top billing despite Lugosi performing the lead role. By this time, Lugosi had been receiving regular medication for sciatic <b>neuritis,</b> and he became addicted to morphine and methadone. This drug dependence was noted by producers, and the offers eventually dwindled down to a few parts in Ed Wood's low-budget movies, most notably Plan 9 from Outer Space.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Adrian and Matthew noticed {{potential}} {{changes of}} the occipital EEG can be observed under stimulation of light. Ciganek developed the first nomenclature for occipital EEG components in 1961. During that same year, Hirsch and colleagues recorded a visual evoked potential (VEP) on the occipital lobe (externally and internally), and they discovered amplitudes recorded along the calcarine fissure were the largest. In 1965, Spehlmann used a checkerboard stimulation to describe human VEPs. An attempt to localize structures in the primary visual pathway was completed by Szikla and colleagues. Halliday and colleagues completed the first clinical investigations using VEP by recording delayed VEPs in a patient with retrobulbar <b>neuritis</b> in 1972. A wide variety of extensive research to improve procedures and theories has been conducted from the 1970s to today and the method has also been described in animals.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} period, {{the use of}} {{medications}} during pregnancy was not strictly controlled, and drugs were not thoroughly tested for potential harm to the fetus. Thousands of pregnant women took the drug to relieve their symptoms. At {{the time of the}} drug's development, scientists did not believe any drug taken by a pregnant woman could pass across the placental barrier and harm the developing fetus, even though the effect of alcohol on fetal development had been documented by case studies on alcoholic mothers since at least 1957. There soon appeared reports of findings of abnormalities in children being born, traced back {{to the use of the}} drug thalidomide. In late 1959, it was noticed that peripheral <b>neuritis</b> developed in patients who took the drug over a period of time, and it was only after this point that thalidomide ceased to be provided over the counter.|$|E
500|$|... 20% to 50% of {{individuals}} with intestinal involvement also exhibit cardiac involvement. Up to 10% of chronically infected individuals develop <b>neuritis</b> that results in altered tendon reflexes and sensory impairment. Isolated cases exhibit central nervous system involvement, including dementia, confusion, chronic encephalopathy and sensory and motor deficits.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{accession}} of Edward's brother King George VI, {{she became}} {{too ill to}} move around, and was confined to Kensington Palace, affectionately called the [...] "Auntie Palace" [...] by Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret. She developed <b>neuritis</b> in her arm, inflammation of the nerves between the ribs, fainting fits, and sciatica. Louise occupied herself by drafting prayers, {{one of which was}} sent to Neville Chamberlain, reading [...] "Guide our Ministers of State and all who are in authority over us ... " ...|$|E
500|$|Adolph {{tried to}} steer his son away from composition, {{hoping that he}} would have a career as a pianist. Holst was oversensitive and miserable. His eyes were weak, but no one {{realized}} that he needed to wear spectacles. Holst's health played a decisive part in his musical future; he had never been strong, and in addition to his asthma and poor eyesight he suffered from <b>neuritis,</b> which made playing the piano difficult. He said that the affected arm was [...] "like a jelly overcharged with electricity".|$|E
500|$|In a July 1945 {{performance}} assessment, Joe Hewitt, now an air commodore and the Air Member for Personnel, {{wrote that}} Stevenson had [...] "displayed great keenness {{in the performance}} of her duties and considerable resourcefulness in the solution of difficult problems". She continued to lead the WAAAF following the cessation of hostilities, retiring on medical grounds on 22March 1946. Suffering reduced muscle function in her left arm and pain {{on the left side of}} her face and neck, she was diagnosed with brachial <b>neuritis,</b> traced to typhus, tetanus and smallpox injections received the previous May in preparation for a proposed visit to Manila that never eventuated. In her last annual address to the WAAAF as its Director, Stevenson encouraged its members to make use of their service experience when they returned to civilian life: ...|$|E
500|$|Chronic {{poisoning}} usually presents {{with symptoms}} affecting multiple systems, but {{is associated with}} three main types of symptoms: gastrointestinal, neuromuscular, and neurological. Central nervous system and neuromuscular symptoms usually result from intense exposure, while gastrointestinal symptoms usually result from exposure over longer periods. Signs of chronic exposure include loss of short-term memory or concentration, depression, nausea, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, and numbness and tingling in the extremities. Fatigue, problems with sleep, headaches, stupor, slurred speech, and anemia are also found in chronic lead poisoning. A [...] "lead hue" [...] of the skin with pallor and/or lividity is another feature. A blue line along the gum with bluish black edging to the teeth, known as a Burton line, is another indication of chronic lead poisoning. Children with chronic poisoning may refuse to play or may have hyperkinetic or aggressive behavior disorders. Visual disturbance may present with gradually progressing blurred vision {{as a result of}} central scotoma, caused by toxic optic <b>neuritis.</b>|$|E
