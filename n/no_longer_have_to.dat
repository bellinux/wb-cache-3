5|$|Starting {{from the}} release of Stage 2, changes {{were made to the}} hunter classes. Every class now {{possesses}} the ability to deploy a force field, an ability once exclusive to the Trapper class. It can be used to limit the Monster's movement to a small area. The ability's cooldown time decreases when the hunters deal enough damage to the monster. Starting from Stage 2, the health of all hunters regenerate if they manage to avoid damage, and they <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> rely on the Medic class.|$|E
5|$|Feeling {{that her}} {{employment}} opportunities were being blocked, that same year, on 19 January 1959, Johnson asked {{to address the}} members of the Bahamian House of the Assembly, but was told she could only speak after the session adjourned, to which she agreed. In her speech, she pointed out that a petition had been submitted to the House in 1958 for suffrage, which Members had claimed showed only 13 petitioners and 529 signatories. She provided mimeographed copies showing the actual number was 2,829 people and included people from Abaco, Andros, Cat Island, Eleuthera, Exuma, Grand Bahama, Long Island, and New Providence. She went on to complain that women were being taxed without representation and reasoned that should the vote not be extended to them, they should <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay taxes. She insisted that women were working members of society and were ready, willing, and able to participate as full citizens. Though the Members of Parliament were impressed with the speech, they did nothing.|$|E

5|$|In August 2007, the MBTA {{published}} a feasibility study exploring {{the possibility of}} rebuilding Yawkey as a full-service station. The study concluded that doing so would increase ridership by 60%, from 585 daily boardings and alightings to 937. On November 15, 2010, Governor Deval Patrick and other officials broke ground on a major rebuilding of the station, originally {{expected to be completed}} in the spring of 2012. The new station has two full-length high-level platforms that provide level, handicapped-accessible boarding for all passengers; the old platform had only a wooden ramp for accessibility. The two 700-foot-long platforms (a side platform between the tracks plus a side platform {{on the south side of}} the tracks) are connected with an overpass, and passengers <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> cross the tracks to access certain outbound trains.|$|E
5|$|The Army {{decided that}} an {{individual}} machine gun, lighter than the M60, but with more firepower than the M16, would be advantageous; troops would <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> rely on rifles for automatic fire. Through the 1960s, {{the introduction of a}} machine gun into the infantry squad was examined in various studies. While there was a brief flirtation with the concept of a flechette- or dart-firing Universal Machine Gun during one study, most light machine gun experiments concentrated on the Stoner 63 light machine gun, a modular weapon that could be easily modified for different purposes. The Stoner63 LMG saw combat for a brief period in Vietnam with the Marine Corps, and later on a wider scale with the U.S. Navy SEALs.|$|E
5|$|Susan {{attempts}} to console Edie's husband, Dave Williams (Neal McDonough), following Edie's death. She explains the truth behind her own accident, completely unaware that Lila and Paige Dash were Dave's wife and daughter, respectively, {{and that he}} had been seeking revenge on Mike since moving to Wisteria Lane. Meanwhile, Jackson returns to Fairview and proposes to Susan, revealing that his visa has expired and he needs to marry an American citizen. When Susan learns that Mike, who is engaged to Katherine, will <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay alimony once she is married, she explains the false pretenses of her engagement. Dave, who now understands that Susan was driving the car that killed his family, overhears this and reports Jackson to immigration officials. With Jackson out of the picture, Dave invites Susan and M.J. on a fishing trip, planning to kill M.J. just like Susan killed his own child. Mike discovers Dave's plans and is able to save Susan and M.J. After the ordeal, Susan and Mike share a brief, yet romantic kiss. Dave is sent to a psychiatric hospital in Boston and two months later, Mike marries an unidentified bride.|$|E

25|$|In {{the past}} China {{promoted}} eugenics {{as part of}} its population planning policies, but the government has backed away from such policies, as evidenced by China's ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which compels the nation to significantly reform its genetic testing laws.

Furthermore, in 2003, China revised its marriage registration regulations and couples <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> submit to a pre-marital physical or genetic examination before being granted a marriage license.|$|E

25|$|Running {{time between}} Malmö C and Copenhagen Central Stations was reduced from 35 to 33 minutes, since the savings gained by the shorter route are partly {{offset by the}} extra stop at Triangeln station. Maximum time savings will be 15–25 minutes for trips to and from Triangeln, a central {{location}} in Malmo. From locations north of Malmö, travel times were reduced by approximately 10 minutes for journeys to Copenhagen, since trains <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> reverse at Malmö C. The full potential of the tunnel will not be realized until the line between Lund and Malmö has been expanded to four tracks, a project currently in advanced planning.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{widespread}} use of the Internet by businesses and corporations drives down energy costs.

Online shopping contributes to less fuel use: a 10-pound package via airmail uses 40% less fuel than a trip to buy that same package at a local mall, or shipping via railroad. Researchers in 2000 predicted a continuing decline in energy due to Internet consumption to save 2.7 million tons of paper per year, yielding a decrease by 10 million tons of carbon dioxide globalwarming pollution per year.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, NBC {{broadcast}} a live production in color of Peter Pan, a new Broadway musical adaptation of J. M.

The broadcast drew the highest ratings for a television program for that period. It {{was so successful}} that NBC restaged it as a live {{broadcast a}} mere ten months later; in 1960, long after Producers' Showcase had ended its run, Peter Pan, {{with most of the}} 1955 cast, was restaged again, this time as a standalone special, and was videotaped so that it would <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be performed live on television.|$|E
