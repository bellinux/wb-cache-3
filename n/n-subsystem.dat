40|$|We {{discuss a}} working {{approximation}} scheme to a recently developed {{formulation of the}} coupled piNNN-NNN problem. The approximation scheme {{is based on the}} physical assumption that, at low energies, the 2 <b>N-subsystem</b> dynamics in the elastic channel is conveniently described by the usual 2 N-potential approach, while the explicit pion dynamics describes small, correction-type effects. Using the standard separable-expansion method, we obtain a dynamical equation of the Alt-Grassberger-Sandhas (AGS) type. This is an important result, because the computational techniques used for solving the normal AGS equation {{can also be used to}} describe the pion dynamics in the 3 N system once the matrix dimension is increased by one component. We have also shown that this approximation scheme treats the conventional 3 N problem once the pion degrees of freedom are projected out. Then the 3 N system is described with an extended AGS-type equation where the spin-off of the pion dynamics (beyond the 2 N potential) is taken into account in additional contributions to the driving term. These new terms are shown to reproduce the diagrams leading to modern 3 N-force models. We also recover two sets of irreducible diagrams that are commonly neglected in 3 N-force discussions, and conclude that these sets should be further investigated, because a claimed cancellation is questionable.

40|$|Incoherent pion photoproduction on the {{deuteron}} is {{studied for}} photon energies from threshold up to 1 GeV with {{special emphasis on}} polarization observables. The elementary γ N→π N amplitude is taken from the MAID model. The influence of final state interactions on total and semi-exclusive cross sections d⃗(γ⃗,π) NN is investigated by including complete rescattering in the final NN- and π <b>N-subsystems.</b> For charged pion-production the influence of NN-rescattering is moderate whereas π N-rescattering is almost negligible. Much stronger influences of NN-rescattering are seen in neutral pion production, {{which is due to}} the elimination of a significant spurious coherent contribution in the impulse approximation. Sizeable effects are also found in some of the beam, target and beam-target asymmetries of the differential cross section. Comment: 27 pages, 27 figure...|$|R
