5|$|In January 2015, Florida State University's Center for Advanced Power Systems has {{unveiled}} a new 24,000-volt direct current power test system, {{the most powerful}} of its kind available at a university research center throughout the world. The <b>new</b> <b>test</b> facility is the latest piece of the center's PHIL testing program. It has a 24,000-volt direct current with a capacity of 5 megawatts, making it the most powerful PHIL system of its kind at a university research center worldwide. To create the new system, the center put together four individual 6 kilovolt, 1.25 megawatt converters that can be arranged in any combination, in series or parallel connection, to form an extremely flexible test bed for medium voltage direct current (MVDC) system investigations.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} <b>new</b> rank <b>tests</b> for <b>testing</b> independence. The <b>new</b> <b>testing</b> {{procedures are}} sensitive {{not only for}} grade linear correlation, but also for grade correlations of higher-order polynomials. The number of polynomials involved {{is determined by the}} data. Model selection is combined with application of the score test in the selected model. Whereas well-known tests as Spearman's test or Hoeffding's test may completely break down for alternatives that are dependent but have low grade linear correlation, the <b>new</b> <b>tests</b> have greater power stability. Monte Carlo results clearly show this behavior. Theoretical support is obtained by proving consistency of the <b>new</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

5|$|Along the Metrorail system, {{the tracks}} are mostly elevated. The three {{sections}} {{that are not}} are under I-95 between Vizcaya and Brickell stations, under I-95 just east of Culmer station, and {{the northern end of}} the line from just east of the Palmetto Expressway heading west into the Palmetto station and tail track. In each of these cases, the tracks ride on ground level for a brief amount of time. The platform at each Metrorail station is long enough to accommodate six-car-long trains; the Dadeland North, Earlington Heights, and Government Center station platforms are long enough to accommodate eight-car-long trains. In-service trains are usually either four or six cars long; in the evening {{it is not uncommon for}} Miami-Dade Transit to link two out-of-service trains together before returning them to Lehman Yard. Trains are stored at the Lehman Yard just west of Okeechobee Station. There are extra tracks and a <b>new</b> <b>test</b> track, known as the Lehman Center Test Track, built at the Lehman Yard.|$|E
5|$|Australia won the toss and batted {{first in}} the Second Test at Lord's. They were on the back foot at 7/258 at stumps on the first day. On the second morning, the Australian lower order counter-attacked; Toshack joined Johnston with the score at 9/320 and they put on 30 runs before Johnston was stumped. Australia regained the momentum, adding 92 runs in 66 minutes of hitting in the morning. One {{sequence}} of two overs from Edrich was taken for 28 runs, with many balls unintentionally spooned over the slips or the covers. Both players swung wildly at the ball, which often went in vastly different directions to where they had aimed their shots. Both made <b>new</b> <b>Test</b> best scores; Toshack scored 20 not out. Both Johnston and Toshack—not known for their batting ability—played without inhibitions, joyfully revelling in their luck. England were then bowled out for 215. Toshack was wicketless, but was the most economical of the bowlers, conceding only 23 runs from his 18 overs. Toshack operated after the first new ball was taken, and as England had fallen to 4/46, they played him cautiously {{in an attempt to}} rebuild the innings. Australia then declared at 7/460 in their second innings with Toshack not required to bat, leaving England a target of 596.|$|E
5|$|When the MCC {{abolished}} amateur {{status in}} cricket in 1963, making all cricketers paid professionals, Allen opposed the change. In 1963, {{he was appointed}} as MCC President. When his one-year term of office ended in late 1964, he {{was appointed to the}} influential role of MCC Treasurer, a position he filled until 1976. During this period, Allen instituted several reforms, including limiting the terms of office of key positions. He streamlined the MCC administration and recruited new people to key positions. Less successfully, he opposed the relaxation of eligibility rules for the County Championship to allow overseas players from 1968. He was heavily involved in a change in the relationship between the MCC and English cricket in 1968. The newly formed Sports Council required that, to receive financial support from the government, cricket be more democratically organised and not run by a private members' club. Allen and S. C. Griffith, the MCC secretary, liaised with the Minister of Sport to set up a new Cricket Council, comprising representatives from the MCC, the <b>new</b> <b>Test</b> and County Cricket Board and the National Cricket Association. This move significantly reduced the influence of the MCC, and at Allen's suggestion, the club's influence within the Cricket Council was further reduced in 1974.|$|E

40|$|In an {{agricultural}} household model, farmers' production decisions {{can be either}} separated or nonseparated from preferences. Since previous studies on agricultural household behavior and policy effects {{have shown that the}} model with separation yields different results than the model with nonseparation, {{it is important to have}} a test to identify the correct model. This paper provides <b>new</b> <b>tests</b> that extend current tests in two directions. First, the <b>new</b> <b>tests</b> avoid issues that current tests have to address, such as simultaneity bias and the estimation of the production function.

25|$|Investigators {{devised a}} <b>new</b> <b>test</b> {{involving}} a cargo hold with {{conditions similar to}} the conditions of Flight 295; the plastic covers and extra pallets provided fuel for the fire, which would spread quickly before generating enough smoke to activate smoke alarms.

This heated air had a higher pressure than normal, and overcame the pressure differential between the cargo hold and the passenger cabin. When the door between the passenger and cargo holds was open, smoke and gases therefore flowed into the passenger cabin.|$|E

40|$|Tail {{alternatives}} {{describe the}} frequent occurrence of a non-constant {{shift in the}} two-sample problem with a shift function increasing in the tail. The classes of shift functions can be built up using Legendre polynomials. It is important to rightly choose the number of polynomials involved. Here this choice {{is based on the}} data, using a modification of Schwarz's selection rule. Given the data driven choice of the model, appropriate rank tests are applied. Simulations show that the new data driven rank tests work very well. While other tests for detecting shift alternatives as Wilcoxon's test may completely break down for important classes of tail alternatives, the <b>new</b> <b>tests</b> have high and stable power. The <b>new</b> <b>tests</b> have also higher power than data driven rank tests for the unconstrained two-sample problem. Theoretical support is obtained by proving consistency of the <b>new</b> <b>tests</b> against very large classes of alternatives, including all common tail alternatives.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} <b>new</b> {{approach}} to <b>testing</b> in the generalized {{method of moments}} (GMM) framework. The <b>new</b> <b>tests</b> are constructed using heteroskedasticity autocorrelation (HAC) robust standard errors computed using nonparametric spectral density estimators without truncation. While such standard errors are not consistent, a new asymptotic theory shows that they lead to valid tests nonetheless. In an over-identified linear instrumental variables model, simulations suggest that the <b>new</b> <b>tests</b> and the associated limiting distribution theory provide a more accurate first order asymptotic null approximation than standard HAC robust tests. Finite sample power of the <b>new</b> <b>tests</b> is shown to be comparable to standard tests. Because use of a truncation lag equal to the sample requires no additional choices for practitioners, the new approach could potentially lead to a standard of practice (which does not currently exist) for the computation of HAC robust standard errors in GMM models. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} <b>new</b> <b>testing</b> semantics, called {{friendly}} testing, whose main property {{is that the}} induced preorder between processes ⊑fr {{is consistent with the}} conformance relation, and so we have, for instance,a ⊕b ⊑fr a ⊑fr a +b. The new theory is strongly based on De Nicola & Hennessy’s work on testing. Friendly tests are defined exactly as in their work, except that internal actions are not allowed. However, in order to obtain the desired notion of friendly testing this restriction is not enough and we also have to relax the conditions to pass a test. Thus we obtain a <b>new</b> <b>testing</b> semantics and a new preorder between processes which is strictly weaker than the relation ⊑must. Moreover, we present an alternative characterization of our <b>new</b> <b>testing</b> semantics by defining a modification of acceptance sets...|$|R
