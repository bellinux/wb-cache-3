500|$|In 2007, the {{two teams}} agreed to {{schedule}} a rematch for September 6, 2010. Deborah Yow stated that, [...] "The citizens of Maryland {{have made it clear}} they want this game." [...] Alluding to the Navy athletic staff's perceived reticence, she added, [...] "We got past the Charlotte situation." [...] The delay in scheduling was attributed to the need for a three-way contract between Maryland, Navy, and the stadium tenants, the Baltimore Ravens. For this reason, a renewal as far off as 2014 was not seriously discussed. Ralph Friedgen said, [...] "I {{would like to see it}} as an annual game, but that's <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> decide." ...|$|E
500|$|Just before Vladimir died, he {{had sent}} his son Boris on {{campaign}} against the nomads in the south. According to the Primary Chronicle, Sviatopolk seized Kiev while those of Vladimir's retainers who were with Boris on campaign encouraged Boris to take power, an offer Boris refused apparently stating [...] "Be it <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> raise my hand against my elder brother". In the confusion resulting from the death of Vladimir Sviatopolk was able to seize power in Kiev, as Yaroslav was in the north, Mstislav in the south, Sviatoslav in the Derevlian land, Gleb in Murom and Boris on the aforementioned expedition against the Pechenegs. As Franklin and Shepard put it, Sviatopolk's [...] "previous arrest turned to his advantage, for it ensured that he was already ... closest {{to the center of}} power". According to the Primary Chronicle, Sviatopolk successfully arranged the murder of three of his brothers, Boris of Rostov, Gleb of Murom and Sviatoslav of the Derevlian lands.|$|E
500|$|As the googly {{caused a}} {{sensation}} following its invention, many other cricketers tried to emulate Bosanquet. Reggie Schwarz, the South African cricketer {{who played for}} Middlesex, learned how to bowl the googly through observation of Bosanquet; Schwarz in turn {{passed it on to}} the South African bowlers Aubrey Faulkner, Bert Vogler and Gordon White. These four raised the bowling of the googly to a high standard and raised fears of the detrimental effect it would have on batting. Following the development of googly bowling by South Africans, it was further refined by English and Australian cricketers until it became firmly established. In later years, the googly was blamed for a deterioration in the quality and attractiveness of batting. Bosanquet refused to accept any blame and published a defence in The Morning Post during 1924, later reprinted in Wisden, which humorously downplayed the impact of the googly. He wrote: [...] "It is <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> defend it. Other and more capable hands have taken it up and exploited it, and, if blame is to be allotted, let it be on their shoulders. For me is the task of the historian, and if I appear too much {{in the role of the}} proud parent, I ask forgiveness." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{story begins}} with a dialog between two characters. The first asks the other [...] "You do know why you're here?", and the second replies: [...] "Yes, there's great {{confusion}} on earth, and the power that is has concluded the following: Perfect man has visited earth already and His voice was heard; The voice of imperfect man must now be made manifest; and I have been selected as the most likely candidate." [...] This statement is followed by [...] "Where's the Show" [...] and [...] "Let Me Be a Man". In the medley, Nelson depicts {{the birth of the}} character, who implores God to become a man. The song is followed by [...] "In God's Eyes", depicting the character learning to act as a good Samaritan. In [...] "Family Bible", the character describes his memories of and nostalgia for his childhood, the times with his family and the reading of the family Bible. [...] "It's <b>Not</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> <b>to</b> Understand" [...] depicts the character praying, after watching a blind child listening to other children playing and finding himself unable to understand why God allowed that to happen. God replies to the Imperfect Man, [...] "It's not for you to reason why, you too are blind without my eyes, so question not what I command". In the last stanza, the character now expresses [...] his fear of the Lord and his reluctance to question the unfairness of the world again. The medley [...] "These Are Difficult Times / Remember the Good Times", describes the character's bad times and his recovery by remembering the good times.|$|E
500|$|Representing {{as he did}} a {{state in}} the Deep South, Mallory could hardly have avoided taking a public stance {{on the issues that}} were tearing the nation apart. The {{occasion}} arose when the Senate considered the admission of Kansas to the Union. Its Lecompton Constitution would allow slavery in Kansas, and citizens who were against extending the practice into new territories seized upon the widespread irregularities in the adoption procedure to oppose it. Senator Preston King of New York mounted a two-hour attack on the constitution and Southern policy in general, following which Mallory replied in what his biographers describe as [...] "probably his most effective speech in the Senate." [...] One segment of his talk presented the rationale of the slave-holders in their unwillingness to accept majority rule. Addressing the question whether the constitution had been ratified by [...] "the people," [...] he said: [...] "States have conferred, and may at any time confer, their whole political power on a minority. They may make disqualifications dependent upon the tenure of freehold estate, upon the payment of tax, upon militia duty, or upon the color of skin; but whoever the State chooses to confer her political authority upon, are the people." [...] He foresaw the decline in relative power of the slave-holding states, although at this time he did not believe it would necessarily lead to secession. He concluded his remarks by a pledge to follow the South whatever happened: [...] "It is <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> indicate the path she [...] may, in her wisdom, pursue; but, sir, ... my whole heart is with her, and she will find me treading it with undivided affections." ...|$|E

Miller preferred that Mathis sing soft, romantic ballads, pairing him up with conductor and music arranger Ray Conniff, and later, Ray Ellis, Glenn Osser, and Robert Mersey. In late 1956, Mathis recorded two of his most popular songs: [...] "Wonderful! Wonderful!" [...] and [...] "It's <b>Not</b> <b>For</b> <b>Me</b> <b>To</b> Say".|$|E

2500|$|The general {{reputation}} of John Hulley {{in the latter}} years of the 1860s appears to have lessened, but the reasons why are unclear. An article in the Cheshire Observer and Chester, Birkenhead, Crewe and North Wales Times of 1 May 1869, may give {{an indication of the}} view of the local press towards him, although his work regarding the health and welfare of the lower classes would have still been positive. The unknown author had attended a Bicycle Tournament at the Liverpool Gymnasium and had scornfully compared it with the performances of Music Hall acrobats. He went on to criticise Hulley as [...] "one of the most, it not the most unpopular man in the town, though whether that is his fault or his misfortune is <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> determine". He acknowledged that John Hulley was undoubtedly a public benefactor, but went on to suggest that everyone in Liverpool was familiar [...] "with his grotesque figure" [...] and his hair reminded him of the waves in The Tempest.|$|E
