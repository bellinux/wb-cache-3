In this work, thin film metal-insulator-metal (MIM) tunnel junction based detector using Ni-NiO-Cr has been developed {{for the first time}} for millimeter wave detection operating at 94 GHz. Extensive process development has been carried out to fabricate the MIM junctions. Arrays of MIM junctions with 1 µm² contact area and ultra-thin insulator layer of ~ 3 nanometer have been developed using e-beam lithography and reactive sputtering, respectively. MIM diodes were also fabricated in a bulk-micromachined diaphragm configuration to minimize surface wave loss. DC and millimeter wave measurements were carried out on the fabricated diodes to determine the device characteristics and performance. The current-voltage (I-V) measurements yielded current in the range of few µA with significant non-linearity and asymmetry. A maximum sensitivity of 7 V?¹ was also obtained from the fabricated diode. These tunnel junctions showed a positive response to millimeter wave signal, with output current in the range of few µA. By controlling the input power of the millimeter wave signal, the output current from the device could be varied. Additionally, MIM diodes with 100 µm² contact area were developed using optical lithography technique. The I-V characteristics of diode demonstrated a uniform behavior, with a sensitivity value of 15 V?¹.

40|$|With ever {{miniaturisation}} of transistor dimensions, quantum {{effects are}} increasingly becoming the domineering mechanism for device operation. Though they follow different laws of physicsin classical sensethan the conventional CMOS transistors, these nanometer-scale {{devices such as}} the Single Electron Transistor (SET) have useful applicationsfor example, acting as the front-end low noise amplifier for extremely weak signals. One such application of the SET that has attracted much research attention is its use in detecting quantum phenomena at deep cryogenic temperatures. The sensitivity of an SET can reach its theoretical limit and therefore holds immense potential as a readout device for future solid state quantum computers. It is however expected that the SET must also communicate with the classical electronics. In this thesis, CMOS microelectronics design for a one-shot readout of the SET is presented. The readout circuit, operating at 4 K temperature and conforming to the micro-level voltage specification of the SET is capable of rapidly detecting a sub-nano ampere level change in the SET currents.

40|$|Abstract: After half {{a century}} of work {{studying}} the interaction of positrons with ordinary matter, there remain several interesting fundamental questions that are uniquely suitable for investigation using antimatter, and several instances where interesting views of the world could be obtained using positrons. In this paper we examine the possibilities for imaging single molecules with positrons and for looking at a possible zero-temperature or quantum phase transition associated with the sticking of slow positronium at a cold surface. We also discuss prospects for future developments of LINAC positron beams using a rare gas moderator and for detecting positronium molecules. 1. OVERVIEW The field of positron physics includes several diagnostic techniques that have become useful, although not widely acclaimed, in certain niches under the skilful hands of some talented experimenters [1, 2]. The positron is a strongly perturbing probe in many cases, but after much work we have good theories of positron interactions with matter and the computers necessary for calculations corresponding to realistic experimental conditions are available. The successful niches include areas such as defects in solids, plasma physics and surface physics that are justified in their existence by good connections to other active fields of science and technology. But for a lack of intensity, beams of low energy positrons might join their cousins (photon, neutron and electron beams) as valuable and unique probes of materials. The invention of brightness enhancement and various proposals for new positron facilities including a <b>nano-ampere</b> positron microprobe for the Stockpile Stewardship Program at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, continue to cause dreams of a new era 115 in antimatter physics.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about an {{innovative}} application of nanoimprinting lithography in organic ferroelectric memories, which can achieve multi-bit data storage. Multi-bit data storage, defined here as storage of multiple bits in a single device cell, can potentially make higher density ferroelectric memory at a lower price. The idea is based on ferroelectric response with regard to ferroelectric film thickness. Two kinds of memory cells were fabricated to test the functionality and performance of the proposed concept. After optimizing the thermal nano-imprinting process to replicate periodicity micro-structure to a ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) film, we first fabricated the ferroelectric capacitor cells with the imprinted polymer film. The fabricated cells, with sizes down to 0. 0589 mm^ 2, showed a promising multi-bit functionality and retention property. Four different imprinting patterns were also compared, the repeating grating structure as line: 20 um / space: 10 um represented the best multi-bit performance in terms of identification of the operation voltage for different bits. A prediction of the imprinting pattern and the ferroelectric capacitor performance were given according to the results. With the same imprinting condition, we also fabricated ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFETs). The FeFETs with periodicity pattern of line: 20 um / space: 10 um was investigated. It is observed that, the smallest imprinted cell with a gate length of 5 um and width of 5 mm only has several <b>nano-ampere</b> of leakage current, which is 10 ^ 5 times smaller than the ON current.

40|$|A DC-DC {{converter}} is {{an important}} power management module as it converts one DC voltage level to another suitable for powering a desired electronic system. It also stabilizes the output voltage when fluctuations appear in the power supplies. For those wireless sensor networks (WSNs) powered by energy harvesting, the DC-DC converter is usually a linear regulator and it resides at the last stage of the whole energy harvesting system just before the empowering sensor node. Due to the low power densities of energy sources, one may have to limit the quiescent current of the linear regulator in the sub-uA regime. This severe restriction on quiescent current could greatly compromise other performance aspects, especially the transient response. This dissertation reports a voltage regulator system topology which utilizes the sensor node state information to achieve ultra-low power consumption. The regulator system is composed of two regulators with different current driving abilities and quiescent current consumptions. The key idea is to switch between the two regulators depending on the sensor state. Since the "right" regulator is used at the "right" time, the average quiescent current of the regulator system is minimized, and the trade-off between low quiescent current and fast transient response has been eliminated. In order to minimize the average quiescent current of the system, <b>nano-ampere</b> reference current design is studied, and the proposed reference current circuit is shown (theoretically and experimentally) to reduce the supply voltage dependence by 5 X. The regulator system has been fabricated and tested using an ON Semiconductor 0. 5 &# 956;m process. It has been verified through experiments that the proposed system reduces the quiescent current by 3 X over the state-of-the-art in the literature; and, more importantly, it achieves low quiescent current, low dropout voltage, and fast transient response with small output voltage variation {{all at the same}} time.

40|$|The {{operational}} transconductance amplifier, OTA {{is one of}} {{the basic}} building blocks in many analogue circuit applications. The low power consumption is an essential parameter in modem electronic designs for many areas particularly for portable devices and biomedical applications. For biomedical applications, the low- power low-voltage OTA-C filters operating at low-frequency ranges are desired. The low-power, low-voltage operation of electronic devices is very important for applications such as hearing aids, pacemakers, and EEG. The importance of such operation is due to the need to implant these electronic circuits inside the body of the patient for long times before re-charging or replacing the batteries as for pacemakers and future hearing aids. The small size lightweight wearable EEG systems are preferable for applications ranging from epilepsy diagnosis to brain-computer interfaces. The low power consumption is achieved by operation at very small levels of current. So, in such applications the operation in the <b>nano-ampere</b> current range is essential to ensure power consumption of nW or few uW. Such very small currents are obtained through the operation of MOS transistors in their sub-threshold regime. The design space in such applications is restricted by their specifications which in turn based {{on the nature of the}} application. In this work, the design and implementation of OTA-C filter topologies for two bio-medical applications are made and discussed. Those applications are represented by hearing aids and EEG applications. In hearing aids, the work focused on cochlear implant and specifically on its most important stage represented by the filter. Four OTA-C filter topologies are proposed and two of them are tested experimentally. For the filter in a hearing aid system, besides its low power operation, it is required to operate with a relatively high dynamic range of 60 dB and above. The dynamic range is the operation space of the filter that specified by the range of signals which can process properly. It is bounded by the maximum power signal less than its distortion overhead level to the minimum power signal more than its noise floor. The maximum signal level the filter can perform properly represents its input linear range. The challenge in CMOS OTA sub-threshold operation is the very small input linear range which makes it extremely difficult to build low-power consumed OTA-C filters with a wide dynamic range, DR. In this work, an OTA with an input linear range of ± 900 mV for total harmonic distortion, THD< 5 % is proposed using MOSFET bumping and capacitor attenuation techniques, combined for the first time. The minimum signal level the filter can distinguish from noise is still relatively small with the use of appropriate OTA architecture and using the gm/ID methodology for MOSFET sizing. So, programmable CMOS OTA-C band-pass filter topologies operating in sub-threshold region with a dynamic range of 65 dB for use in bionic ears were proposed. The power consumption for the proposed filters is in nano- Watt range for their frequency range of (lOO-I Ok) Hz. Also, a 4 -channel OTA-C filter bank is designed and tested. The EEG signals have small amplitudes and frequency bands ranges of uV'S and (l- 40) Hz respectively. The important issue is to design filters with small noise floor with white dominant. This is achieved with the proposed OTA which is of relatively simple architecture and with operation in the deep weak-inversion region using ± 1. 5 V supply rails. The OTA-C filter has power consumption in the pico-Watt range for 0, e, and a signals and less than 3 nW for B signals. Another topology is suggested for future work.
