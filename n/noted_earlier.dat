5|$|In 1943, Walter Baade was {{the first}} person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Baade {{identified}} two distinct populations of stars based on their metallicity, naming the young, high-velocity stars in the disk Type I and the older, red stars in the bulge Type II. This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way, and elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been <b>noted</b> <b>earlier</b> by Jan Oort.) Baade also discovered that there were two types of Cepheid variables, which resulted in a doubling of the distance estimate to Andromeda, as well as the remainder of the Universe.|$|E
5|$|The {{agreement}} between the Navy and the USCG (<b>noted</b> <b>earlier),</b> required the initial classes of SPAR officer candidates to receive their indoctrination training at Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts; officially known as the United States Naval Reserve (WR) Midshipmen's School. But in June 1943, the USCG withdrew from the agreement, and the indoctrination of SPAR officer candidates {{was transferred to the}} USCG Academy at New London, Connecticut. It was the only U.S. military service that trained women officer candidates at its own academy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year that Anstey (and his friend William Hayward Roberts) were working on their Elegia Scripta in Coemeterio Rustico, Latine reddita (1762), another Latin version was {{published}} by Robert Lloyd with the title Carmen Elegiacum. Both were subsequently included in Irish collections of Gray’s poems, accompanied not only by John Duncombe’s “Evening Contemplation”, as <b>noted</b> <b>earlier,</b> but in the 1775 Dublin edition by translations from Italian sources as well. These included another Latin translation by Giovanni Costa and two into Italian by Abbate Crocci and Giuseppe Gennari. The pattern of including translations and imitations together continued into the 19th century with an 1806 bilingual edition in which a translation into French verse, signed simply L.D., appeared facing the English original page by page. However, the bulk of the book was made up of four English parodies. Duncombe’s “Evening contemplation” was preceded by a parody of itself, “Nocturnal contemplations in Barham Down’s Camp”, which is filled, like Duncombe’s poem, with drunken roisterers disturbing the silence. Also included were Jerningham’s “The Nunnery” and J.T.R’s “Nightly thoughts in the Temple”, the latter set in the gated lawyer’s quarter in London.|$|E

25|$|Stress and {{intonation}} in Shilha are {{the subject}} of a monograph by Roettger (2017), who used instrumental testing. He established the fact that Shilha does not have lexical stress (Roettger 2017:59), as <b>noted</b> <b>earlier</b> by Stumme (1899:14) and Galand (1988, 2.16).|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} Kandyan (osaria) style {{consists of}} a full blouse which covers the midriff completely and is partially tucked in at the front. However, modern intermingling of styles has led to most wearers baring the midriff. The final tail of the sari is neatly pleated rather than free-flowing. This is rather similar to the pleated rosette used in the Dravidian style <b>noted</b> <b>earlier</b> in the article.|$|E
25|$|Some of Plato's famous {{works are}} Phaedo, the Crito, and, as <b>noted</b> <b>earlier,</b> the Meno. Within {{these works are}} found a {{comprehensive}} philosophy that addresses epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics, theology, and logic. As noted, most of the writing {{is in the form}} of dialogues and arguments to pursue answers to difficult questions and concepts. Plato's teacher and mentor, Socrates, always plays a significant and formative role in these dialogues.|$|E

As <b>noted</b> <b>earlier,</b> James Hoch (1990) sees {{the source of the}} signs in Egyptian Old Kingdom characters (c. 2700 - 2200) and so this West Semitic syllabary would have been invented in that period.|$|E
25|$|Secured {{creditors}} may {{in certain}} instances assume the senior management roles within the bankrupt company, however <b>noted</b> <b>earlier</b> this situation {{occurs when the}} secured creditor(s) have foreclosed on their lien. Large secured creditors again may influence the decision making process, but that secured creditor can not enter into that contract {{on behalf of the}} bankrupt company. Only the bankrupt company's senior management and/or board of directors have the power to do an assignment.|$|E
25|$|Regular {{inspection}} of the ballast shoulder is important; as <b>noted</b> <b>earlier,</b> the lateral stability of the track depends upon the shoulder. The shoulder acquires some amount of stability over time, being compacted by traffic; maintenance tasks such as replacing ties, tamping, and ballast cleaning can upset this stability. After performing these tasks, {{it is necessary for}} either trains to run at reduced speed on the repaired routes, or to employ machinery to compact the shoulder again.|$|E

25|$|Secured and {{unsecured}} creditors {{constitute the}} creditor body. Both secured and unsecured creditors {{are ahead of}} shareholders as <b>noted</b> <b>earlier.</b> A secured creditor is a creditor, who has a priority claim on an asset or assets of a company. A lien on the specific asset or assets places the secured creditor's claim ahead of the unsecured creditor. Once a secured creditor is satisfied, the unsecured creditor is then the next priority. This is again the normal order of priority in a bankruptcy.|$|E
25|$|Hero sailed {{in company}} with Baleine, of Le Havre, Captain Reuben Baxter. Between 10 July and 15 August they cruised the coast, but after having {{gathered}} only 200 barrels of oil, they sailed first to St Helena {{and then to}} St Catherine, Brazil. Swallow captured both Hero and Baleine. Swallow {{was reported to have}} arrived at Rio de Janeiro on 17 August 1804. As <b>noted</b> <b>earlier,</b> Swallow took Hero back to Britain. Swallow apparently abandoned Baleine, though in what state, and what happened to her subsequently, is not clear.|$|E
25|$|As <b>noted</b> <b>earlier,</b> the Palas built {{a number}} of monasteries and other sacred structures. The Somapura Mahavihara in present-day Bangladesh is a World Heritage Site. It is a monastery with 21 acre (85,000 m²) complex has 177 cells, {{numerous}} stupas, temples and {{a number of}} other ancillary buildings. The gigantic structures of other Viharas, including Vikramashila, Odantapuri, and Jagaddala are the other masterpieces of the Palas. These mammoth structures were mistaken by the forces of Bakhtiyar Khalji as fortified castles and were demolished. The art of Bihar and Bengal during the Pala and Sena dynasties influenced the art of Nepal, Burma, Sri Lanka and Java.|$|E

25|$|<b>Noted</b> <b>earlier</b> {{this is a}} state form of bankruptcy, not federal form. The {{assignment}} process or any bankruptcy process for that matter is a legal matter. The state attributes of an {{assignment process}} may be understood by any attorney however a local/regional bankruptcy attorney in the specific state usually is best equipped to handle the legal {{end of the process}} for the company making the assignment. This is not asserted to diminish an attorney’s capabilities, but to stress the legal niche that this legal instrument falls within, bankruptcy. Non legal staff familiar with bankruptcy and the assignment process can also affect the speed validity of the process.|$|E
25|$|Operation of a {{solar cell}} can be {{understood}} from the equivalent circuit at right. Light, of sufficient energy (greater than the bandgap of the material), creates mobile electron–hole pairs in a semiconductor. Charge separation occurs because of a pre-existing electric field associated with the p-n junction in thermal equilibrium (a contact potential creates the field). This charge separation between positive holes and negative electrons across a p-n junction (a diode) yields a forward voltage, the photo voltage, between the illuminated diode terminals. As has been <b>noted</b> <b>earlier</b> in the terminology section, the photo voltage is {{sometimes referred to as}} the photo emf, rather than distinguishing between the effect and the cause. The charge separation causes a photo voltage that drives current through any attached load.|$|E
25|$|Sadly, the {{conditions}} of Ælfgifu's return to fortune remain unclear. It would have been important to know, for instance, how and what on terms she came to hold the estates mentioned in her will. Those at Newnham Murren and Linslade were previously granted to her by King Edgar and now returned to the royal family, but {{it is impossible to}} determine which of the other estates were part of her dower property and which were inherited or acquired otherwise. As <b>noted</b> <b>earlier,</b> a case has been made for Princes Risborough as having been passed on through the maternal line. If the other holdings were likewise her own, the rehabilitation of her position may have come at a great price, one which considerably enriched the royal family with land north of the Thames.|$|E
