5|$|Eichmann stated at {{his later}} interrogations that Heydrich told him in mid-September that Hitler had ordered that all Jews in German-controlled Europe {{were to be}} killed. The initial plan was to {{implement}} Generalplan Ost after the conquest of the Soviet Union. However, with the entry of the United States into the war in December and the German failure in the Battle of Moscow, Hitler decided that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately rather than after the war, which now had <b>no</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>sight.</b> Around this time, Eichmann was promoted to SS-Obersturmbannführer (lieutenant colonel), the highest rank he achieved.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1940, Hitler asked Himmler {{to draft}} a new plan for the {{elimination}} of the Jews of Europe, and Himmler passed along the task to Heydrich. His draft proposed the deportation of the Jews to the Soviet Union via Poland. The later Generalplan Ost (General Plan for the East), prepared by Professor Konrad Meyer and others, called for deporting the entire population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, either for use as slave labour or to be murdered after the Soviet defeat. After the Axis failure in the Battle of Moscow and the entry of the United States into the war in December 1941, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately rather than after the war, which now had <b>no</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>sight.</b> Since transporting masses of people into a combat zone would be impossible, Heydrich decided that the Jews would be killed in extermination camps set up in occupied areas of Poland. The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people.|$|E
5|$|The {{third factor}} {{which led to}} the quick {{disintegration}} of II Corps was the poor state of morale amongst the soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. By 1975, the morale of South Vietnamese soldiers and their commanding officers had reached its lowest point as the war continued to drag on with <b>no</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>sight.</b> The determination of the ARVN officer corps had taken a serious blow when South Vietnamese Foreign Minister Tran Van Lam returned from the United States in February 1975, and reported that no additional military or economic aid had been offered. When the order was given to abandon the Central Highlands, the primary concern of South Vietnamese military personnel was not battlefield victories, but the welfare of their families. Consequently, when the North Vietnamese attacked South Vietnamese forces on Route 7, large numbers of South Vietnamese soldiers left the battlefield to search for their families amidst the chaos. During the final days of South Vietnam’s existence, the average South Vietnamese soldier showed more loyalty to his family than to his commanding officer, which {{had a significant impact on}} his willingness to fight on.|$|E

Indiana's constitution prohibited a governor to serve {{more than four years}} in any eight-year period, but Morton was elected as Indiana's lieutenant governor in 1860 and had only been completing Lane's term, so he claimed that was eligible to run for governor in the upcoming election. The Democrats were furious and launched a bitter campaign against Morton, who did not do a great deal of campaigning.

500|$|Between {{the date}} the invitations {{to the conference}} went out (29 November) and {{the date of the}} {{cancelled}} first meeting (9 December), the situation changed. On 5 December, the Soviet Army began a counter-offensive in front of Moscow, ending the prospect of a rapid conquest of the Soviet Union. On 7 December, the Japanese attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor, causing the U.S. to declare war on Japan the next day. The Reich government declared war on the U.S. on 11 December. Some invitees were involved in these preparations, so Heydrich postponed his meeting. Somewhere around this time, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately, rather than after the war, which now had <b>no</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>sight.</b> At the Reich Chancellery meeting of 12 December 1941 he met with top party officials and made his intentions plain.

Following the meeting, Himmler made a note on his service calendar, which simply stated [...] "Jewish question/to be destroyed as partisans".|$|E
500|$|The Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project's final {{construction}} project was straightening the Kissimmee River, a meandering -long river that was drained {{to make way}} for grazing land and agriculture. The C started building the C-38 canal in 1962 and the effects were seen almost immediately. Waterfowl, wading birds, and fish disappeared, prompting conservationists and sport fishers to demand the region be restored before the canal was finished in 1971. In general, C projects had been criticized for being temporary fixes that ignored future consequences, costing billions of dollars with <b>no</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>sight.</b> After Governor Bob Graham initiated the Save Our Everglades campaign in 1983, the first section of the canal was backfilled in 1986. Graham announced that by 2000 the Everglades would be restored as closely as possible to its pre-drainage state. The Kissimmee River Restoration project was approved by Congress in 1992. It is estimated that it will cost $578million to convert only [...] of the canal.

500|$|In {{contrast}} to other women's war fiction of the period, Manning's works do not recount {{life on the}} home front. Instead, her Irish and Second World War fiction observe combatants and non-combatants at the front and behind the lines. Wars, in Manning's view, are battles for place and influence, and [...] "with her range of images and illusions, Manning reminds us that wars over land have been a constant." [...] Her books do not celebrate British heroism nor the innocence of civilians, emphasising instead that the causes and dangers of war come as much from within as from without, with the gravest threats coming from fellow Britons. Military men are far from heroic, and official British responses are presented as farcical. In the Fortunes of War, the conflict is viewed largely {{from the perspective of}} a civilian woman, an observer, though later books include Simon Boulderstone's soldier's view of battle. Views differ on her success in the Fortunes of War battlescenes; initial reviews by Auberon Waugh and Hugh Massie criticised them as implausible and not fully realised, but later commentators have describing her depiction of battle as vivid, poignant and largely convincing. Her books serve as an indictment of war and its horrors; William Gerhardie noted in 1954 of Artist among the Missing that [...] "it is war seen in a compass so narrowed down that the lens scorches and all but ignites the paper." [...] There is a strong focus of the impermanence of life; death and mortality are a constant presence and preoccupation for civilian and soldier alike, and repetition – of stories, events and deaths – used to give [...] "the impression of lives trapped in an endless war" [...] for which there is <b>no</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>sight.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although {{relations}} between the Spanish and the Native Americans in the earlier expeditions to the valley were initially friendly, the indigenous people began to grow accustomed to, and thus started taking advantage of, the Spanish that later came to the San Joaquin River region. As early as the 1807 Moraga expedition, {{it was reported that}} some natives were hostile and attempting to steal their horses. Indeed, when the natives began to rustle cattle and horses for food, the Spanish retaliated by burning camps and villages, and forcibly taking native children for labor at the various missions.

The model may serve decision-makers as an easy-to-use tool to systematically evaluate preventive returns management measures such as avoidance and gatekeeping.|$|R
