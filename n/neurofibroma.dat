The French database comprised 1083 patients meeting NIH diagnostic criteria for NF 1 and the Neurofibromatosis Institute Database of North America comprised 703 patients. Patients younger than 17 years of age were eligible for our study if they had been evaluated for internal <b>neurofibromas</b> using computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical characteristics associated with internal <b>neurofibromas</b> by univariate analysis (P[*]≤[*] 0. 15) were entered into a multiple logistic regression model after checking for potential interactions and confounding. Multiple imputation was used for missing values. RESULTS: Among the 746 children in the two databases, 357 (48 %) met our inclusion criteria. Their mean age was 7. 7 [*]±[*] 5. 0 years and there were 192 (53. 8 %) males. Internal <b>neurofibromas</b> were present in 35 (9. 8 %) patients. Internal <b>neurofibromas</b> developed earlier in females than in males and their prevalence increased during adolescence. Factors independently associated with internal <b>neurofibromas</b> were age (OR[*]=[*] 1. 16 [1. 07 - 1. 27]), xanthogranulomas (OR[*]=[*] 5. 85 [2. 18 - 15. 89]) and presence of both subcutaneous and plexiform <b>neurofibromas</b> (OR[*]=[*] 6. 80 [1. 52 - 30. 44]).

40|$|Cutaneous <b>neurofibromas</b> are the {{hallmarks}} of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1). They are composed of multiple cell types, and traditionally they are believed to arise from small nerve tributaries of the skin. A key finding {{in the context of}} this view has been that subpopulations of tumor Schwann cells harbor biallelic inactivation of the NF 1 gene (NF 1 −/−). In the present study, our aim was to clarify further the pathogenesis of cutaneous <b>neurofibromas.</b> First, we detected cells expressing multipotency-associated biomarkers in cutaneous <b>neurofibromas.</b> Second, we developed a method for isolating and expanding multipotent neurofibroma-derived precursor cells (NFPs) from dissociated human cutaneous <b>neurofibromas</b> and used it to analyze their growth and differentiation potential. In analogy to solitary cells resident in <b>neurofibromas,</b> NFPs were found to express nestin and had the potential to differentiate to, at least, Schwann cells, neurons, epithelial cells, and adipocytes. Mutation analysis of the NFPs revealed that their genotype was NF 1 +/−. The results led us to speculate that the development of cutaneous <b>neurofibromas</b> includes the recruitment of multipotent NF 1 +/− precursor cells. These cells may be derived from the multipotent cells of the hair roots, which often are intimately associated with microscopic <b>neurofibromas...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Neurofibromas</b> are benign {{tumors of the}} {{peripheral}} nerves and hallmark of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1), a tumor suppressor gene syndrome. <b>Neurofibromas</b> mostly start developing at puberty and can increase in size and number during pregnancy. Expression of progesterone receptors {{has been found in}} 75 % of the tumors. Many female NF 1 patients are thus concerned about the possibility that hormonal contraceptives may stimulate the growth of their <b>neurofibromas.</b> Methods A survey was carried out on 59 female NF 1 patients who are practicing or have practiced hormonal contraception to examine the effect of the various contraceptives on the growth of <b>neurofibromas.</b> Results Majority (53 out of 58) of patients who received oral estrogen-progestogen or pure progestogen preparations reported no associated tumor growth. In contrast, significant tumor growth was reported by two patients who received depot contraceptive containing high dose of synthetic progesterone. Conclusions Oral contraceptives do not seem to stimulate the growth of <b>neurofibromas</b> in NF 1 patients. High doses of progesterone might stimulate the growth of <b>neurofibromas</b> and deserve more caution. </p...|$|R

Between 2005 and 2008, 110 NF- 1 adults having two or more SC-NFs were individually matched for age, sex and hospital with 110 controls who had no SC-NF. Patients underwent standardized MRI of the spinal cord, nerve roots and sciatic nerves and an electrophysiological study. Analyses used adjusted multinomial logistic regression (ORa) to estimate the risk of the presence of internal <b>neurofibromas</b> or peripheral neuropathies associated with patients presented 2 to 9 SC-NFs, at least 10 SC-NFs as compared to patients without any (referential category). RESULTS: Cases had a mean age of 41 (+/- 13) years; 85 (80 %) had two to nine SC-NFs and 21 (19 %) at least ten SC-NFs. SC-NFs were more strongly associated with internal <b>neurofibromas</b> in patients with ten or more SC-NFs than in patients with fewer NF-SCs (e. g., sciatic nerve, aOR= 29. 1 [8. 5 to 100] vs. 4. 3 [2. 1 to 9. 0]). The association with SC-NFs was stronger for diffuse, intradural, and > 3 cm internal <b>neurofibromas</b> than with other internal <b>neurofibromas.</b> Axonal neuropathy with slowed conduction velocities (SCV) was more strongly associated with having at least ten SC-NFs (aOR= 29. 9, 5. 5 to 162. 3) than with having fewer SC-NFs (aOR= 4. 4, 0. 9 to 22. 0).
