50|$|Nitric acid {{presented}} a constant problem, corroding parts and causing skin burns and respiratory irritation. Tanks of sodium carbonate solution were kept around to neutralize acid spills. On 20 February 1942, the engine exploded during a full system test.

Pressurized nitric acid from a broken propellant line drenched Pallo. Fortunately, quick thinking mechanics dunked him head-first into a tank of soda solution.

5000|$|These {{have either}} two throats or two thrust {{chambers}} (with corresponding throats). The central throat is {{of a standard}} design and is surrounded by an annular throat, which exhausts gases from the same (dual-throat) or a separate (dual-expander) thrust chamber. Both throats would, in either case, discharge into a bell nozzle. At higher altitudes, where the ambient pressure is lower, the central nozzle would be shut off, reducing the throat area and thereby increasing the nozzle area ratio. These designs require additional complexity, but an advantage of having two thrust chambers {{is that they can}} be configured to burn different propellants or different fuel mixture ratios. Similarly, Aerojet has also designed a nozzle called the [...] "Thrust Augmented Nozzle", which injects propellant and oxidiser directly into the <b>nozzle</b> <b>section</b> for combustion, allowing larger area ratio nozzles to be used deeper in an atmosphere than they would without augmentation due to effects of flow separation. They would again allow multiple propellants to be used (such as RP-1), further increasing thrust.|$|E
5000|$|Velocity {{compound}} [...] "Curtis". Curtis {{combined the}} de Laval and Parsons turbine {{by using a}} set of fixed nozzles on the first stage or stator and then a rank of fixed and rotating blade rows, as in the Parsons or de Laval, typically up to ten compared with up to a hundred stages of a Parsons design. The overall efficiency of a Curtis design is {{less than that of}} either the Parsons or de Laval designs, but it can be satisfactorily operated through a much wider range of speeds, including successful operation at low speeds and at lower pressures, which made it ideal for use in ships' powerplant. In a Curtis arrangement, the entire heat drop in the steam takes place in the initial nozzle row and both the subsequent moving blade rows and stationary blade rows merely change the direction of the steam. Use of a small section of a Curtis arrangement, typically one <b>nozzle</b> <b>section</b> and two or three rows of moving blades, is usually termed a Curtis 'Wheel' and in this form, the Curtis found widespread use at sea as a 'governing stage' on many reaction and impulse turbines and turbine sets. This practice is still commonplace today in marine steam plant.|$|E

40|$|Flow of {{nitrogen}} gas through a converging-diverging nozzle is simulated. The flow is modeled using the Navier-Stokes equations {{that have been}} modified for vibrational nonequilibrium. The energy equation is replaced by two equations. One equation accounts for energy effects due to the translational and rotational degrees of freedom, and the other accounts for the affects due to the vibrational degree of freedom. The energy equations are coupled by a relaxation time which measures the time required for the vibrational energy component to equilibrate with the translational and rotational energy components. An improved relaxation time is used in this thesis. The equations are solved numerically using the Steger-Warming flux vector splitting method and the Implicit MacCormack method. The results show that uniform flow is produced outside of the boundary layer.

Unsteady side-loads, induced by the interaction of flow separation inside of the nozzle and the launcher wake will strongly influence the design of future main stage propulsion systems. This interaction phenomenon, called buffeting coupling, {{is one of the main}} challenges during ascent. The purpose of the presented study is to simulate a combined generic base-flow nozzle configuration under fully turbulent conditions. It is intended as a generic model of the central stage of a launcher, including central body and nozzle area. Experimental data under transonic conditions is available from wind tunnel tests in the scope of the ATAC program. Simulations are carried out with recent turbulence models like detached-eddy simulation (DES). DES is a hybrid technique proposed by Spalart et. al. for the simulation of this kind of turbulent unsteady flows. The idea is to combine the best features of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and the large eddy simulation (LES) for the computation of realistic configurations at high Reynolds numbers. The study was carried out by means of unstructured grids in the whole area including jet- and nozzle flow.

One of the experimental activities in this scope was performed by DLR at the P 6. 2 facility in Lampoldshausen, Germany, providing an experimental data base for the DLR TIC nozzle under overexpanded cold gas conditions.

For the impactor stage, three <b>nozzle</b> <b>sections</b> each containing 12 nozzles were designed from theory to achieve a cut-off diameter (d 50) of 300 nm. Various depths of 37 -mm-diameter foam cylinders were tested for the diffusion stage to obtain a collection efficiency curve similar to the deposition of nanoparticles in the human respiratory tract, the nanoparticulate matter (NPM) criterion. The objective for the final filter was a collection efficiency of near 100 % with minimal pressure drop. The collection efficiencies by size and pressure drop were measured for all components. The impactor stage {{with one of the}} nozzle plates had a d 50 of 305 nm. The collection efficiency for the foam with a depth of 7 cm adjusted for presence of the impactor was the closest match to the NPM curve with a R 2 value of 0. 96. Chemical analysis of the metal content for foam media affirmed that the high-flow NRD would require less sampling time to meet LOQs than the 2. 5 L/min NRD. The final filter with a modified support pad had a collection efficiency near 100 %. The overall pressure drop of the sampler 4. 4 kPa (17. 5 in.
