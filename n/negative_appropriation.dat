The above question is approached by shedding light on a smaller quantitative aspect of the correlation between daily mobility and socioeconomic resources as well as conducting a comprehensive field study of the daily mobility amongst marginalized citizens in Sjælør - a specific deprived urban area within Copenhagen. The target group for the field study consists of female immigrants living in Sjælør {{in the southern part}} of Copenhagen. The field study provides data for a qualitative study of the conditions for daily mobility amongst the target group of female immigrants. The empirical data is a result of various fieldwork methods conducted during 2013, consisting among others, of observations, interviews and participating methods. The thesis is inspired by theories on inequalities and segregation in cities in addition to theories of mobility, specifically combining notions of advanced marginality (Loïc Wacquant), field, capital and habitus (Pierre Bourdieu) and motility (Vincent Kaufmann). Marginalised citizens statistically have a limited access to mobility. The study on mobility capital amongst the immigrant women shows that the most important conditions for mobility consists of factors rooted in various socio-economic dimensions of everyday life, both physical, social and symbolic. These dimensions are all related to access, such as long distances in the neighbourhood and a segregated mobility flow. The target group has a limited access to transport technologies e. g. cars and bicycles. As such their common modes of transport are walking and public transport technologies. Family obligations and everyday shopping constitute the structure of their daily mobility. The social dimension is related to skills such as health capacity and knowledge skills, which are required to actualise daily mobility. In the symbolic dimension, the <b>negative</b> <b>appropriation</b> of fear limits the mobility practise of these marginalized women, while social relations and potential health effect represent a positive appropriation of mobility among the target group. The analysis shows, that the habitus of the women is relevant for their mobility capital and positions. The analysis furthermore finds that the group of immigrant women positions themselves between two practices of mobility: a normatively desired ‘Danish’ and a less desired ‘female immigrant’. The thesis thus argues that these findings regarding daily mobility of marginalized citizens can be described as mobility segregation. Concluding that urban planning in Copenhagen should address the question of inequalities in mobility, this thesis recommends a higher degree of collaboration between physical and social planning in the public housing sector and municipal traffic planning. In addition, the thesis discusses how methods regarding the relations between the three dimensions of daily mobility (access, skills and appropriation) can be combined in a relational mobility planning approach. Especially a more collaborative approach in the various sectors of the planning system is recommended, and that an emphasis on the urban planning concerning deprived neighbourhoods should prioritise a focus on mobility development to counteract the effects of urban segregation...|$|E
40|$|The Constitution provides: No Money {{shall be}} drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be {{published}} from time to time. This Clause establishes two related duties: a <b>negative</b> <b>appropriations</b> requirement and an affirmative reporting obligation. While several constitutional scholars have explored the appropriations requirement, there is limited scholarship on the corollary reporting obligation. Even among legal scholars, the Statement and Account Clause has been considered only in the context of national security matters. This Note marks a first step in filling this void...|$|R
40|$|The first {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a model where provision to a common property resources (CPR) depends on the level of cooperation in appropriation. The second objective is to propose a model that links provision to the quality of cooperation in appropriation when there are <b>negative</b> externalities in <b>appropriation</b> and the third objective is to show how this model can be constructed. Topics of discussion includes linking provision to cooperation, linking cooperation in appropriation to provision, and joint determination of provision and appropriation...|$|R
