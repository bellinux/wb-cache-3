Consequently, hunger and thirst adversely affected the morale of the Italian defenders that had already been shaken by the defeat at Sidi Barrani. So too did medical conditions undermine morale, particularly lice and dysentery, the results of poor sanitation.|$|E
5|$|Some reviewers fondly {{recalled}} serendipitous in-game encounters as {{they learned}} the game environment's unwritten rules. <b>Not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> foreign figures would react, Rock, Paper, Shotgun reviewer treated new encounters as puzzles. This experimentation led to moments of fearful scrambling across {{a room to}} avoid a new, encroaching enemy type, and discovering that other enemies that are harmless if left alone. Rain World was abundant with opportunities for a player to demonstrate ingenuity and improvisation, according to GameSpot reviewer, whose highlights included making a mouse into a dark room's lantern, using weapons as climbable objects, and luring enemies into battle to distract from the Slugcat's presence. Those critics considered these mysterious, perceptive interactions {{to be among the}} game's best features, though far outweighed by Rain World punishing game mechanics.|$|E

Variações' music is characterized by the use of a variety of instruments, ranging from synthesizers, to Portuguese and classical guitars, to accordions and more. Defying genre definition, he created his own description for his sound: something between Braga and New York, reflecting the cosmopolitan, yet down to earth and rural aspect of his eclectic style. He was intent on becoming a popular artist in the true sense of the word and he managed to reach audiences which were very diverse, from the blue collar to the white collar workers, to the uneducated and the intellectuals, to young and old alike.|$|E

25|$|On Tuesday, February 7, 2006, a UPS Douglas DC-8 {{cargo plane}} {{suffered}} an in-flight cargo fire {{and made an}} emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport after filling with smoke. There were no injuries other than smoke inhalation affecting the crew, but the plane burned {{on the ground for}} hours into the night, though most of the cargo survived, the aircraft was a total loss, with multiple holes burned through the roof skin. According to the NTSB, the firefighting crew did not have adequate training on using their skin-piercing extinguishing equipment and <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> to open the main cargo door, attempted to force the handle and broke the latch, rendering the door unopenable. There were also difficulties in obtaining the cargo manifest to determine what if any hazardous materials were on board, due to confusion about protocol. However, despite these failings, the airport staff, including the firefighting staff, managed the incident successfully without injury or major disruption of the airport. The NTSB suspected lithium ion batteries were the source of ignition and made recommendations for more stringent rules and restrictions on their air transport, especially on passenger aircraft (unlike this one). For a cause of the incident, the NTSB focused on the delayed indication of fire by the required onboard fire detection system and criticized the standards to which such systems are tested, noting that the tests use an empty cargo hold and do not represent the real-world performance of the detection systems with the hold full of cargo, which significantly changes the flow patterns of hot air and smoke. The crew and air traffic control personnel were found to have behaved properly (with minor exceptions) and not to be at fault for the incident or its outcome.|$|E
