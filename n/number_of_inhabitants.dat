5|$|The {{presence}} of foreign residents in Cortina d'Ampezzo {{is a fairly}} recent phenomenon, accounting for only a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>inhabitants</b> in what in any case is a fairly small town. There are 298 resident foreigners in the town, representing 4.9% of the total population. This compares with 7.0% in the town Belluno, 6.4% in the entire province of Belluno, and 10.2% in the Veneto region.|$|E
5|$|Changes in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>inhabitants</b> {{is known}} {{throughout}} the population censuses conducted since 1793 in Calais. Note the massive growth in population from 13,529 in 1881 to 58,969 in 1886, a growth of 335.9%; {{this is because}} the city of Saint Pierre merged with Calais in 1885. According to the census INSEE of 2008, Calais has 74,817 people (a decrease of 3% from 1999). The town's population ranked 60th nationally, down from 53rd in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland has a {{dense network}} of towns, where large, medium and small towns are complementary. The plateau is very densely {{populated}} with about 450 people per km2 {{and the landscape}} continually shows signs of human presence. The weight of the largest metropolitan areas, which are Zürich, Geneva–Lausanne, Basel and Bern tend to increase. In international comparison {{the importance of these}} urban areas is stronger than their <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>inhabitants</b> suggests.

5|$|Skopje {{economic}} life greatly benefited from {{its position in}} the middle of Turkish Europe. Until the 17th century, Skopje experienced a long golden age. Around 1650, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>inhabitants</b> in Skopje was between 30,000 and 60,000 and the city contained more than 10,000 houses. It was then one of the only big cities on the territory of future Yugoslavia, together with Belgrade and Sarajevo. At that time, Dubrovnik, which was a busy harbour, had not even 7,000 inhabitants. Following the Ottoman conquest, the city population changed. Christians were forcibly converted to Islam or were replaced by Turks and Jews. At that time, Christians of Skopje were mostly non converted Slavs and Albanians, but also Ragusan and Armenian tradesmen. Ottoman Turks drastically changed the appearance of the city. They organised the Bazaar with its caravanserais, mosques and baths.|$|E
5|$|Overcrowding was {{a serious}} problem {{in many of the}} ad hoc {{secondary}} camps set up in the Saigon region, and led to public health issues. The Biên Hòa region on the northeastern outskirts of Saigon was scheduled to have a capacity of 100,000 refugees, but this was soon exceeded. In the Ho Nai camp near Bien Hoa, which was supposed to hold only 10,000 refugees, more than 41,000 were present by the end of 1954. The area surrounding Thủ Dầu Một north of the southern capital had initially been allocated a quota of 20,000 even though there was no rice paddies in the area. The area near Tây Ninh was to accommodate 30,000 people, although the locals thought that 100,000 could fit in. Some large Catholic settlements such as Thủ Đức, Bình Thạnh and Gò Vấp on the outskirts of Saigon have now been subsumed by urban sprawl and are now districts of the city. Because of the excessive <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>inhabitants,</b> the infrastructure at many camps could not cope and the promises made to the refugees were not kept. American military doctors travelled around the south in groups of three, and because of the paucity of health professionals, saw around 150–450 patients per day. They were also hampered by customs law, which only allowed charities to bring medicine into the country without taxation. This forced them to turn to charitable organisations as a conduit, creating another layer of bureaucracy. This was exacerbated by the fact that some corrupt Vietnamese officials pocketed the medical aid.|$|E

25|$|Using the Land Books (jarðarbøkur) it is speculated, {{that the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>inhabitants</b> in Sørvág in the 17th century was around fifty. In the first census in the Faroes in 1801 the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>inhabitants</b> in Sørvág {{had risen to}} a mere 86. In 1855 the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>inhabitants</b> was 163. The reason for this slow {{progress}} {{is due to the}} special requirements for marriage, that were law in the Faroes. The law said, that in order to marry you would need to own land or have demonstrated that you were a faithful servant to someone who owned land. It was only the wealthy farmers who had a substantial amount of land, and therefore the birthrate in the Faroes was very low until this law was abolished.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> poor <b>inhabitant</b> in South Kalimantan {{decreased}} {{within the}} last three years compared with the previous years. The <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> poor <b>inhabitant</b> differs from time to time. This scaled dynamical number has been a problem for the local government to take proper polices to solve this matter. It will then be necessary to predict a potential <b>number</b> <b>of</b> poor <b>inhabitants</b> in the next year as the basis on subsequent policy making. This research will apply both Least Square and Moving Average method as the measurement to count prediction values. From the results of the study, the prediction analysis by using those two methods is valid for predicting acquired <b>number</b> <b>of</b> poor <b>inhabitant</b> for the next period according to the data from the previous year. Based on the study, the validity of Least Square was 98. 35 % and Moving Average was 98. 79 % by using the data in the last seven years...|$|R
