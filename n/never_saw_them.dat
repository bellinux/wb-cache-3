5|$|Prior to his arrest, Chandler {{worked as}} an {{unlicensed}} aluminum-siding contractor. He testified in his own defense, {{against the advice of}} his attorneys, saying that he had met the Ohio women and had given them directions, but that he <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> again aside from in newspaper coverage and on the billboards set up by authorities. Police originally theorized that two men were involved in the murders, but this was discounted once Chandler was arrested. Following his conviction, Chandler was incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution, and, during his seventeen years of incarceration until his execution, he was notable for not having had a single visitor.|$|E
5|$|Fischer and Cristina {{often did}} outdoor {{activities}} together, but Fischer's stepmother {{thought they were}} only friends. She said that she <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> hold hands or behave {{in a way that}} suggested intimacy. According to his friends, Fischer went with Cristina to South Padre Island, Texas, during spring break and had sex with her in her parents' condominium. They said that he did not brag about it, and in fact seemed to regret his decision. Cristina denied this ever happened. Later that year they attended St. Joe's prom together. In June 1992, Fischer broke up with Cristina; he told one of his friends that their relationship was only physical, and he did not feel an emotional attachment to her. Fischer had given Cristina his ring while they were dating, and once they broke up he asked her to return it. Cristina refused.|$|E
5|$|At {{his trial}} in Clearwater, Florida, Chandler {{said that he}} met the Rogers women and gave them directions, but he <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> again except in {{newspaper}} coverage and on billboards. He never told the authorities {{that he had seen}} the women again. He acknowledged that he was on Tampa Bay that nightthe police had evidence of three ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home during the time frame of the murdersbut Chandler maintained that he was fishing alone. He claimed that he had returned home late because his engine would not start, which he attributed to a gas line leak. He said that he had called the Coast Guard and the Florida Marine Patrol, and had flagged down a patrol boat, but both were too busy to help. He said that he subsequently fixed the line with duct tape and returned safely to shore. However, there were no records of distress calls from Chandler to either the Coast Guard or the Marine Patrol that night, nor were there any Coast Guard boats on the bay the following morning that could have helped him. According to a boat mechanic, who testified for the prosecution, Chandler's explanation of repairing the boat's alleged gas leak was not tenable because the fuel lines in his boata Baylinerwere directed upward. A leak would have sprayed fuel into the air rather than into the boat, and the corrosive gasoline would have eaten away the adhesive properties of the duct tape Chandler maintained he had used to repair the purported leak. Under interrogation from Pinellas County prosecutor, Douglas Crow, Chandler then said he could not remember.|$|E

2500|$|After a brief conversation, Polanski {{had packed}} up his camera gear and Huston saw them drive {{off in his}} car. Huston told police the next day, after Polanski was arrested, that she [...] "had {{witnessed}} nothing untoward" [...] and <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> together in the other room. Gailey learned afterwards that Huston had recently broken up with Nicholson, but stopped by {{to pick up some}} belongings.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1814, after Napoleon's decisive {{defeat at}} the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813, the Allied armies of Austria, Prussia and Russia, with over five hundred {{thousand}} men, invaded France {{and headed for}} Paris. Napoleon departed the Tuileries Palace for the front on January 24, leaving behind the Empress and his son; he <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> again. He commanded only seventy thousand men, but managed a skillful campaign[...] Within Paris, most Parisians were desperately tired of the war. Since the time of Louis XIV, Paris had no walls or other major defensive works. Napoleon's own foreign minister, Prince Talleyrand, was in secret communication with Czar Alexander I; on March 10 he wrote to him, saying that Paris was undefended, and urging him to march directly to the city.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the family}} moved west to Texas, Murphy's father died along the way in New Orleans. Murphy, her aunts, uncles and two {{brothers}} moved further south to Matamoros, Tamaulipas where Murphy would work with her aunts, running a hotel, from 1846 to 1850. Her brother and uncle went to California in the Gold Rush and she <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> again. She met John Bernard Murphy in Matamoros. He had been stationed there {{while working as a}} volunteer in General Zachary Taylor's army. Murphy married John in Matamoros on May 4, 1849 in the Matamoros Cathedral. [...] In 1850, Murphy and her husband settled in Corpus Christi, where her husband owned a ranch and worked as a lawyer. Murphy also brought her two aunts, Johanna and Mary Murphy, to live with them on the ranch.|$|E

2500|$|During their {{extended}} periods {{in the hotel}} suite, the Beatles collaborated on a psychedelic-themed painting, using brushes and paints supplied {{by one of the}} visiting tradesmen, and listened to a tape of their new album. Whitaker photographed them at work and later commented: [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> calmer, more contented than at this time. They were working on something that let their personalities come out … They'd stop, go and do a concert and then it was, 'Let's go back to the picture!'" [...] Having struggled to find a title for the new album since their arrival in Munich, the Beatles finally settled on Revolver and informed EMI of their decision by telegram on 2 July. Whitaker recalled that, despite the hours of confinement in the Hilton, the atmosphere within the band while in Tokyo was [...] "a crescendo of happiness".|$|E

6000|$|... "They {{were very}} cunning, though. They {{must have thought}} that there was some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone, and never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every day, and <b>never</b> once <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> separate. Drebber himself was drunk half the time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched them late and early, but <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> the ghost of a chance; but I was not discouraged, for {{something}} told me that the hour had almost come. My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and leave my work undone.|$|R

60|$|The natives seldom {{brought me}} anything. They are poor creatures, and, rarely shoot a bird, pig, or kangaroo, {{or even the}} {{sluggish}} opossum-like Cuscus. The tree-kangaroos are found here, but must be very scarce, as my hunters, although out daily in the forest, <b>never</b> once <b>saw</b> <b>them.</b> Cockatoos, lories, and parroquets were really the only common birds. Even pigeons were scarce, and in little variety, although we occasionally got the fine crown pigeon, which was always welcome as an addition to our scantily furnished larder.|$|R
