2500|$|San Francisco <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> forage {{extensively}} in aquatic habitats. Adult snakes feed primarily on California red-legged frogs (Rana draytonii), which are federally listed as threatened.

40|$|Extended Abstract: Habitat loss, alteration, and {{fragmentation}} are {{the main}} factors that threaten the endangered sharp-tailed snake (Contia tenuis) throughout its Canadian range, which occurs on the southern Gulf Islands and southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Although the species can tolerate some degree of disturbance and can coexist with humans, intensified urban development associated with an expanding human population, threatens its survival. For example, a property next to a site known {{to be used by}} sharp-tailed snakes was cleared to the bedrock before housing construction took place; as a result no sharp-tailed snake habitat remains there. In this paper, we outline proactive, ‘snake-friendly ’ land management practices and summarize small-scale restoration projects that we have initiated. As part of a stewardship project, and in collaboration with the Sharp-tailed Snake Recovery Team, we developed a brochure that encourages residents within the sharp-tailed snake’s range to adopt snake-friendly landscaping and gardening practices. This brochure informs landowners and land managers about design, maintenance, and proactive measures that will benefit this and other species of reptiles, all of which are harmless to humans. Both the sharp-tailed snake and the <b>northwestern</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> (Thamnophis ordinoides) feed extensively on slugs, and may hel...|$|E

5000|$|The saliva of {{a common}} <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> may be toxic to {{amphibians}} and other small animals. <b>Garter</b> <b>snakes</b> were researched and studies show they have a mild venom in their saliva. For humans, a bite is not dangerous, though it may cause slight itching, burning, and/or swelling. Most common <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> also secrete a foul-smelling fluid from postanal glands when handled or harmed.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many species}} of North American <b>garter</b> <b>snake,</b> the western {{terrestrial}} <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> possesses a mildly venomous saliva. Specimens collected from Idaho and Washington produced venom with myonecrotic (muscle tissue-killing) effects when injected into the gastrocnemius muscles of mice. Several cases of mild human envenomation with local edema and other symptoms (but without any systemic symptoms) have occurred from the wandering <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> subspecies, including in Colorado.|$|R
50|$|Studies {{show that}} the warmer the {{temperature}} of a <b>garter</b> <b>snake,</b> the more likely the snake is to flee a predator; a snake with a cooler body temperature remains stationary or attacks. Male <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> {{are also more likely}} to flee. <b>Garter</b> <b>snakes</b> that exhibit more aggressive anti-predatory displays tend to also be fast and have high stamina. However the cause for correlation is unknown.|$|R
50|$|T. sirtalis, T. marcianus and T. sauritus are {{the most}} popular species of <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> kept in captivity. Baby <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> shed their first skin almost immediately, and will begin eating soon after. <b>Garter</b> <b>snakes</b> just require a 10-gallon (38 liter) terrarium. The first {{shedding}} is very fine and often disintegrates in minutes under the slithering masses of new <b>snakes.</b> Feeding baby <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> can be tricky; earth worms (not compost worms), night crawlers (called dew worms in Canada), silversides (fish), or cut up pieces of pinky mice (thawed fully and waved before the snake on a pair of tongs or hemostats to avoid nipping fingers) will entice appetites. Up to 10 days may pass before a baby <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> eats; it takes them some time to become accustomed to new settings.|$|R
50|$|The {{checkered}} <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> is {{the easiest}} <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> to tame. Even a wild-caught one can become tame {{in a few days}} if handled carefully.

Captive breeding, while not common, is done, and albino variants are being produced.|$|R
2500|$|For a {{brief period}} from 1996 to 2000 there was {{confusion}} over the differentiation of the San Francisco <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> from two other subspecies, known as the California red-sided <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> (T. s. infernalis) and the Oregon red-spotted <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> (T. s. concinnus). Barry petitioned [...] the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) to suppress the changes proposed in 1996 to merge two of these species. In 2000, the ICZN agreed and voted to retain the historical taxonomic arrangement of subspecies within this evolutionary lineage. Accordingly, the subspecies tetrataenia was reaffirmed for the San Francisco <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> and the races concinnus and infernalis retain their historical definition.|$|R
