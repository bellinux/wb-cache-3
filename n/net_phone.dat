The search network is maintained by the two-layer lexical tree, in which the first layer reflects the word <b>net</b> and the <b>phone</b> <b>net</b> while the second layer the dynamic programming (DP). Because the acoustic information is tied in the second layer, the memory cost is so small that it {{has the ability to}} process some complicated applications, {{such as the use of}} cross-word context-dependent (CD) triphone models, the Chinese fuzzy syllable mapping and the pronunciation modeling. The search algorithm based on the two-layer lexical tree is also proposed, which is derived from the token-passing algorithm. Finally, an implementation of the two-layer lexical tree using the cross-word context-dependent triphone models is presented, and the experimental results show that the highly efficient decoding can be achieved without too much memory cost. 1...|$|R

In 1996, the typical player was someone like Delta Three, {{who used the}} Internet as a backbone network, used agreements with local ISPs to ?gray-market? terminate traffic in a country, such as Columbia or Israel, and then used a VocalTec type gateway to interconnect the local call with an E&M or R 2 type signaling.

For the communication system hardware one has to combine existing correctness proofs for components of time triggered architectures (e. g. clock synchronization) and arguments about hardware correctness into a single theorem.

As {{people across}} the globe are {{becoming}} more interested in watching their weight, eating more healthily, and avoiding obesity, a system that can measure calories and nutrition in everyday meals can be very useful. Recently, due to ubiquity of mobile devices such as smart <b>phones,</b> <b>Net</b> books and tablets, the health monitoring applications are accessible by the patients practically all the time. A semi-automated food intake measurement application, running on a mobile device, could assist the patient to estimate his/her consumption calories. In this paper, to improve {{the accuracy of the}} current state of the art technologies, we have engaged color k-mean clustering along with color mean shift and texture segmentation schemes to get more accurate results in segmentation phase. Furthermore, the proposed system is built on food image processing techniques and uses nutritional fact tables. Via a special calibration technique, our system uses the built-in camera of such mobile devices and records a photo of the food before and after eating it in order to measure the consumption of calorie and nutrient components. The proposed algorithm extracts important features such as shape, color, size and texture. Using various combinations of these features and adopting computational intelligence techniques, such as support vector machine, as a classifier, accurate results are achieved which are very close to the real calorie of the food...|$|R

It has limited RF power output, a fixed, built in antenna, and you can’t even select the operating frequency. These devices do though leverage {{billions of dollars in}} worldwide network investment. Until Amateur Radio starts to think beyond just home stations and at more fixed infrastructure and networking, our emergency communications capabilities, particularly in the digital arena, will be limited. One evening in mid 2002 I checked into the Minnesota Section <b>Phone</b> <b>Net.</b> It was one of those days when we had some traffic- a periodic military Divisional Reunion, and about five messages were being held for us. It took quite a while for these to be sent and for operators in each of the areas to be rounded up. I think we got all five or maybe four of the five messages handled in the half hour the net normally runs. Later that week, in June 2002, there was an article in the Wall Street Journal talking about how hospitals would have to improvise a response to a “dirty bomb ” attack (1). While the article focused on the notion of limited emergency room capacity and shortages of decontamination facilities, the point was that we were not prepared for many types of terrorist incidents or accidents. This was before the massive build-up in Federal and other funding for terrorism response, and the widespread adoption of the Incident Command System.

According to the 1996, 2004 and 2010 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), the maternal mortality ratios(MMR) or maternal deaths per 100, 000 live births were 529, 578, and 454 per 100, 000 live births respectively for the 10 -year period prior to the surveys [1, 2]. Maternal mortality levels by age, education or wealth often reveal major inequities, highlighting the need to reach the most vulnerable. But such information is not available from national surveys because the DHS applies the ‘‘sisterhood method’’, an indirect technique used to estimate maternal mortality (see box). We assessed maternal mortality in a large household census including all 225, 000 households in five districts, giving timely mortality data by relative wealth, educational levels and distance to the nearest health facility We used information collected during a 2007 household survey of all households in five districts of Tandahimba and Newala in Mtwara Region and Lindi Rural, Ruangwa and Nachingwea in Lindi Region [5, 6].

A chamada &# 8213;geração digital&# 8214; nasce, cresce, aprende e vive conectada a um mundo digital repleto de informações circulantes e mutantes, disponibilizadas por meio de dispositivos digitais móveis, como aparelhos celulares, netbooks, tablets etc. Diferentemente de gerações passadas, a atual geração demonstra habilidades para navegar em movimento nas informações de inúmeros canais e veículos, tudo ao mesmo tempo. Nesse contexto, a educação também não está imune aos efeitos da tecnologia móvel. De que maneira ocorre a apropriação desta tecnologia nas escolas? Como a educação &# 8213;formal&# 8214; percebe e lida com os aparelhos celulares dentro da sala de aula? Quais são os desafios? Este trabalho de pesquisa inicia uma reflexão interdisciplinar, que envolve tecnologia da informação e comunicação e educação, em busca de respostas para esses questionamentos. Com ênfase no aparelho celular, busca-se aqui saber se e como o ambiente escolar incorpora a tecnologia móvel no processo educacional.
