Her doctor informed {{her that she had}} a [...] "buildup of cocaine residue around the cervix and in the vagina." [...] Grier writes that her doctor warned her about what he termed the [...] "epidemic." [...] He asked if perhaps Pyror put cocaine on his penis to sustain his erection, to which she replied, [...] "It's not like he has a pile of cocaine <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and he dips his penis in it before we have sex." [...] The doctor advised her to use condoms then asked her if her mouth went numb while performing oral sex on Pryor, she says it did, he linked it the Novocaine-like effects of cocaine. Grier confronted Richard about protecting her health to which he said, “I hate condoms. I can’t feel anything.” ...|$|E

If there is any gold, it is down <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> rock. And don't fill the pan too full." [...] The boys worked eagerly, and soon had the pan nearly full of the sand. Mr. Portney then carried it to a nearby pool and allowed the water to run over the top, then brushed off the surface and began to [...] "wash down." [...] This took several minutes, and Randy and Earl stood by almost breathless during the process.|$|E

50|$|An {{irrigation}} and water source was imperative <b>to</b> keeping <b>the</b> garden alive. The most complicated irrigation system used canals {{dug into the}} earth. This required that the water source be placed at the highest part of the garden so gravity could aid {{in the distribution of}} the water. This was more commonly used with raised <b>bed</b> gardens, as <b>the</b> channels could run in <b>the</b> pathways <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds.</b> Kitchen garden ponds also were used come the 14th and 15th centuries, and were meant to offer ornamental value as well. Manure was placed in <b>the</b> ponds <b>to</b> provide fertilization and water was taken straight from <b>the</b> pond <b>to</b> water <b>the</b> plants.|$|R
5000|$|During {{his life}} with the King, he had a footman {{assigned}} to him to clean him and was allowed to sleep on an easy chair <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> King's <b>bed.</b> He wore a collar that read [...] "I am Caesar. I belong <b>to</b> <b>the</b> King".|$|R
50|$|According to Dubai Police, he {{was dead}} by 9 p.m. that evening. On 20 January 2010, the {{following}} day, a hotel cleaner attempted to gain entry, but found that the door was latched from the inside. A member of hotel security was then called in to open the door. After the door was opened, al-Mabhouh's body was discovered on the bed. On the drawer <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> the assassins had placed a small bottle of medicine {{to make it appear}} as if he had died of natural causes.|$|E
50|$|General Von Klinkerhoffen, {{sitting in}} a {{hospital}} bed with a straitjacket on, is given soup to eat and a straw to eat it through. However, when the nurse has gone, he gets on his knees in the bed, manages to get near a telephone standing on a small table <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> gets the receiver off and tries to contact somebody {{to get him out of}} hospital. As he is doing so, Gruber and Von Flockenstuffen arrive, without Von Klinkerhoffen noticing them. However, they do not see the telephone at all - only the bowl of fruit standing next to it. They therefore think he is talking to the fruit and leave, convinced he is still mad.|$|E
5000|$|Another visitor commented, [...] "After a {{few minutes}} of hopping about and {{shouting}} I think they ran out of things to do. If they had tried to wreck it, or stolen the vodka or her knickers, I might have felt differently. It made my weekend." [...] The men only had time to start a pillow fight and attempt a swig from one of the empty vodka bottles <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> before they were apprehended. The police and security guards were booed when they took the pair away. Cai and Xi were arrested for their action, but no charges were pressed, since [...] "neither the gallery nor the artist had any desire to bring the matter further".|$|E
50|$|Tuncovec is {{the site}} of a mass grave {{from the end of the}} Second World War.

The grave contains an unknown number of Croatian refugees murdered in May 1945.|$|R
50|$|Quietly tie up even knots, {{putting into}} each one money, {{a piece of}} coal, a lump of earth, a piece of clay from the stove, grain or seeds, and a small rag. All these knotted pieces are placed in a tub, <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> girl's <b>bed,</b> {{so that they can}} be touched without leaving <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> <b>The</b> {{meanings}} of the different knots are: the ring represents a wedding, money represents riches, coal represents fire, earth represents death, rag represents children, seeds or grains represent a good harvest.|$|R
50|$|<b>Next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stone <b>bed</b> of <b>the</b> cannon is {{a plaque}} stating {{that it was}} used in the Battle of Long Island in 1777. The doughboy is {{depicted}} in a heroic, defiant pose, with his shirt open and his helmet off, on the adjacent ground. Originally he was carrying a Springfield rifle with bayonet in his left hand; it has been replaced following the theft of the original. He stands atop a white pedestal, with plaques listing Suffern's dead from the different wars memorialized on each facet.|$|R
50|$|Later, {{in another}} scene, after {{finishing}} the painting, Johnny shows it to Thierry, Zandalee and Tatta. While they {{go off to}} other rooms and sensing Zandalee's frustration and vulnerability, Johnny makes a pass at her. Johnny continues to pursue Zandalee and when they {{run into each other}} during a rain storm, he takes advantage and moves in by seducing her, first in his loft in an angry passionate scene, (interestingly, Zan's wedding ring is on the table <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed)</b> which is followed by him erotically finger painting her. Their sexual liaisons continue to occur in various places including her laundry room a top a washing machine while Thierry and guests are having dinner. Thierry soon suspects the two are having an affair.|$|E
50|$|The next night, Malcolm and Kisha {{have sex}} with the camera on for about three hours. In {{the middle of the}} night, Kisha wakes up and stands <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> for a few hours before walking {{out of the room and}} making a big crash and {{screaming}} Malcolm's name. When Malcolm comes out of his room, Kisha throws him back, and he hits the camera, knocking him out. When Kisha enters the room her shirt is bloody. She crawls to Malcolm and sniffs his body until he farts in her face. As Kisha lunges at the camera, her face takes on a demonic appearance. A minute later, Malcolm wakes up telling everyone he survived and Kisha is behind him making him scream.|$|E
5000|$|Example: Plaintiff P slices her lip on a shard {{of glass}} that somehow {{made its way}} into a salad {{prepared}} in defendant D's restaurant. D later visits P in the hospital, puts a bouquet of sunflowers on the table <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> where P is sobbing in pain, and exclaims,"I'm so sorry about your injury, it was completely my fault! Please don't worry about your expenses for this hospital visit, I'll write you a check for whatever your bills add up to." [...] In a subsequent personal injury suit brought by P against D in federal court, P may introduce D's statement [...] "I'm so sorry about your injury, it was completely my fault!"

5000|$|In the 2014 film Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Rogers takes {{advantage}} of the vibranium's properties by jumping out of a building a few dozen stories up, and landing on the shield, thereby surviving without any serious injuries. During his street battle with the Winter Soldier, Rogers temporarily loses <b>the</b> shield <b>to</b> his adversary, with the Winter Soldier wielding it momentarily. Near the end of a confrontation with the Winter Soldier, the shield falls into the Potomac River, but appears again <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Captain's <b>bed</b> as he is recovering in a hospital.|$|R
5000|$|Tellem is {{a native}} of Philadelphia. His mother named him after a brave knight in the Prince Valiant comic strip. He grew up on the Main Line and became a sports junkie at age eight by playing APBA Baseball, a {{mail-order}} board game. Years later, for luck on his wedding night, he propped his treasured 1938 Hank Greenberg APBA card on <b>the</b> nightstand <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conjugal <b>bed.</b> At 12, he found career inspiration from legendary Temple University basketball coach Harry Litwack, who answered a question -- [...] "What's your favorite food?"—that young Arn had phoned in to a local radio station.|$|R
40|$|This study {{estimated}} the annual loss of soil distributed on a catchment, located in Cariri, Ceará, using GIS and USLE quantitative model {{in an integrated}} form. Delimited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> catchment area of São José - BHSJ through the digital elevation model of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission - SRTM using Arc Hydro Tool Arc GIS software. Soil losses were estimated by USLE. The maps generated for the parameters R, K, LS and C are obtained from data spatially. The factor P was admitted as 1. 0 {{because there were no}} measures to control erosion. <b>To</b> evaluate <b>the</b> results of soil loss with susceptibility <b>to</b> erosion, <b>the</b> values obtained were classified according to levels of susceptibility to erosion. Most erosivity was calculated in EP 3 (1, 804 MJ mm ha- 1 yr- 1), due to higher rainfall recorded this season. The use and occupation of land presents undergrowth <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> of rivers due to intense exploitation of these areas for agriculture. The area of conurbation between Crato and Juazeiro shows the transformation of this growing rural urban basin. <b>The</b> geoprocessing tools <b>to</b> perform a fast parameterization allowed the factors of USLE. The use of SRTM for obtaining the topographic factor proved to be a good alternative, since obtaining such factor is time consuming manual way. Unprotected areas of vegetation and hillside areas with high slope present themselves as <b>the</b> most susceptible <b>to</b> erosion. Pages: 5705 - 571...|$|R
5000|$|On 14 December, 557, Constantinople was {{affected}} by a great earthquake. The date is estimated based on the accounts of John Malalas and Theophanes the Confessor. Anatolius {{was killed by a}} falling piece of marble, evidently within his own residence. [...] "Anatolius was sleeping at the time in his customary bedchamber. ... One of these marble plaques, which was fastened to the wall <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> was shaken loose from its fittings and wrenched off by the violence of the tremors. It came down with all its weight on his head, and smashed his skull. He had barely enough time to utter a deep and muffled groan of pain and then sank back on his bed. Death had overtaken him." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{music video}} was shot for the song. It shows Best Friend (Arjen) visiting Me (who is not {{performed}} by James LaBrie) at the hospital. Sitting <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> Best Friend {{looks at a}} photo album that he is holding. Through the photos of him and Me, Best Friend remembers the good times he had with Me, like camping, chasing girls, stealing fruit, etc. Meanwhile, the band is shown performing next to a swimming pool. Arjen and Ed are seen playing the acoustic guitar and the drums, respectively, while Peter Vink and Joost Van den Broek are playing the bass guitar and the keyboard, respectively. In the end, all the musicians are seen performing in the pool, while swimming, or just diving at the pool, along with a young Best Friend and Me.|$|E
50|$|One night, {{they come}} across a small town. They sneak through, and get into a house, where the only {{inhabitant}} is a lonely widow {{sitting in a chair}} <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of her presumably deceased husband. She doesn't seem to notice they are there, but she does however seem to be guarding a basket of bread. The two ignore her and loot the house, finding many supplies and even a rifle. While Ansell prepares to leave, MacConnachie takes a piece of bread from the woman's basket, causing her to drop out of her trance and scream, causing them to flee as the townspeople are alarmed. At the town limits, Ansell tells MacConnachie that he wants to continue travelling with him, which is against MacConnachie's idea of splitting up. He eventually consents and the two continue on.|$|E
5000|$|Wall {{running is}} a sport where the {{participant}} uses {{a wall and}} platforms placed <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trampoline <b>bed</b> in order <b>to</b> do tricks. <b>The</b> basic movement is a backdrop and the feet touching the wall {{at the top of}} the bounce. From there, there is no limit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> acrobatic movements that are possible, similar <b>to</b> regular trampolining. <b>The</b> advantage is that twists and turns can be initiated more forcefully from a solid wall and that the vertical speed can be transferred to rotation in addition <b>to</b> forces from <b>the</b> legs or arms. Additionally, energy can be gained both from <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> at <b>the</b> bottom of the bounce, and from the wall {{at the top of the}} bounce.|$|R
50|$|Although Japan {{has become}} a more secular society (see Religion in Japan), 91% of {{funerals}} are conducted as Buddhist ceremonies. Immediately after a death (or, in earlier days, just before the expected death), relatives moisten the dying or deceased person's lips with water, a practice known as water of the last moment (matsugo-no-mizu). Most Japanese homes maintain Buddhist altars, or butsudan (仏壇), for use in Buddhist ceremonies; and many also have Shinto shrines, or kamidana (神棚). When a death occurs, the shrine is closed and covered with white paper <b>to</b> keep out <b>the</b> impure spirits of the dead, a custom called kamidana-fūji (神棚封じ). A small table decorated with flowers, incense, and a candle is placed <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deceased's <b>bed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Co-sleeping also {{increases}} {{the risks of}} suffocation and strangulation. The soft quality of the mattresses, comforters, and pillows may suffocate the infants. Some experts, then, recommend that <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> should be firm, {{and should not be}} a waterbed or couch; and that heavy quilts, comforters, and pillows should not be used. Another common advice given to prevent suffocation is to keep a baby on its back, not its stomach. Parents who roll over during their sleep could inadvertently crush and/or suffocate their child, especially if they are heavy sleepers, over-tired or over-exhausted and/or obese. There is also the risk of <b>the</b> baby falling <b>to</b> a hard floor, or getting wedged between <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and <b>the</b> wall or headboard. A proposed solution to these problems is the bedside bassinet, in which, rather than bed-sharing, <b>the</b> baby's <b>bed</b> is placed <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> parent's <b>bed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Leoben {{then takes}} {{her to the}} bedroom where her mother lies on her deathbed and gives Starbuck another chance {{to be with her}} mother as she dies. Starbuck sits <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and notices her mother holds a {{scrapbook}} filled with all her childhood drawings, including the swirling Eye. Starbuck takes her mother's hand as she tells her that she is happy she came back. She presses her daughter's hand against her face as she takes her final breath. Starbuck quietly sobs, but is partially relieved to have been at her mother's final moments. Leoben tells her that death is not hard to embrace, and that is the message her mother was trying to tell her all along. Starbuck finally sees Leoben as something else, perhaps not a Cylon, but her spiritual guardian. Leoben says he never claimed he was actually Leoben.|$|E
50|$|Justine gets {{extremely}} intoxicated at a party, {{when she}} meets Alexia who takes {{her to the}} morgue. The next morning, everyone in the school stares at Justine, some avoiding her. After a lecture, Adrien shows her a video of Alexia taunting her with a dead body, which she lusts after like an animal. Justine confronts Alexia and they fight. Alexia bites part of Justine's face off and they both bite each other's arms. Later, Alexia bandages Justine's wound. The morning after, the hazing week ends and Justine awakens to find Adrien dead in his bed, with most of his right leg eaten away. She thinks she killed him in her sleep at first but finds a bloody ski pole on the floor <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and a stab wound in his back. She {{gets out of the}} bed to find a bloody and mostly catatonic Alexia slumped in the kitchen holding a video game controller. Justine takes the ski pole and points at Alexia's head but then decides not to kill Alexia. Justine takes Alexia to the shower to get her cleaned up.|$|E
5000|$|Sheppard {{took the}} stand in his own defense, testifying {{that he had been}} {{sleeping}} downstairs on a daybed when he awoke to his wife's screams. [...] I think that she cried or screamed my name once or twice, during which time I ran upstairs, thinking that she might be having a reaction similar to convulsions that she had {{in the early days of}} her pregnancy. I charged into our room and saw a form with a light garment, I believe, at that time grappling with something or someone. During this short period I could hear loud moans or groaning sounds and noises. I was struck down. It seems like I was hit from behind somehow but had grappled this individual from in front or generally in front of me. I was apparently knocked out. The next thing I knew, I was gathering my senses while coming to a sitting position <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> my feet toward the hallway.... I looked at my wife, I believe I took her pulse and felt that she was gone. I believe that I thereafter instinctively or subconsciously ran into my youngster's room next door and somehow determined that he was all right, I am not sure how I determined this. After that, I thought that I heard a noise downstairs, seemingly in the front eastern portion of the house.|$|E
