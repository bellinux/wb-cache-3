25|$|Channing {{continued}} {{her return to}} the stage by teaming up again with playwright John Guare. She received Tony Award nominations for her performances in his plays, The House of Blue Leaves (1986) and Six Degrees of Separation (1990), for which she also won an Obie Award. The Alan Ayckbourn play Woman in Mind received its American premiere Off-Broadway in February 1988 at the Manhattan Theatre Club. The production was directed by Lynne Meadow and the cast included Channing {{in the role of}} Susan, for which she won a Drama Desk Award for Best Actress. When once asked if Susan was Channing's most fully realized character, the actress replied: Well, you like to think that they’re all fully realized because what you’re doing is different from what anyone else is seeing. You do a character but {{how much of it is}} on film, or how much of it is seen by an audience, is really up to the director, the piece, or the audience. And so, I just do these people. And flesh them out. I think anything else is <b>not</b> <b>my</b> <b>job.</b>|$|E

Two months later, he and Bobby Lashley appeared on the NBC game show Deal or No Deal as [...] "moral support" [...] to longtime WWE fan and front row staple, Rick [...] "Sign Guy" [...] Achberger. Edge and Randy Orton also appeared, but as antagonists. On April 9, 2008, Cena, along with fellow wrestlers Triple H and Chris Jericho, appeared on the Idol Gives Back fund-raising special. In March 2009, Cena made an appearance on Saturday Night Live during the show's cold opening sequence. On March 7, 2009, he was a guest on NPR's quiz show Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! in a <b>Not</b> <b>My</b> <b>Job</b> sequence titled [...] "Sure, pro wrestling is a good gig, but when you win, do they throw teddy bears into the ring?".|$|E
500|$|Marburger {{responded to}} {{criticism}} of his support for Bush administration policies in 2004, stating [...] "No one will know my personal positions on issues as long as I am in this job. I am here {{to make sure that}} the science input to policy making is sound and that the executive branch functions properly with respect to its science and technology missions." [...] On the topic of stem cell research, he in 2004 said that stem cells [...] "offer great promise for addressing incurable diseases and afflictions. But I can’t tell you when a fertilized egg becomes sacred. That’s <b>not</b> <b>my</b> <b>job.</b> That’s not a science issue. And so whatever I think about reproductive technology or choice, or whatever, is irrelevant to my job as a science adviser." [...] However, in February 2005, in a speech at the annual conference of the National Association of Science Writers, he stated, [...] "Intelligent design is not a scientific theory.... I don't regard intelligent design as a scientific topic". Also In 2005, he told The New York Times that [...] "global warming exists, and we have to do something about it." ...|$|E

500|$|Like Ice-T's {{gangsta rap}} albums, Body Counts {{material}} focused on various {{social and political}} issues, with songs focusing on topics ranging from police brutality to drug abuse. According to Ernie C, [...] "Everybody writes about whatever they learned growing up, and we were no exception. Like The Beach Boys sing about the beach, we sing {{about the way we}} grew up." [...] Ice-T states that [...] "Body Count was an angry record. It {{was meant to be a}} protest record. I put my anger in it, while lacing it with dark humor." [...] The spoken introduction, [...] "Smoked Pork" [...] features Ice-T taking on the roles of a gangster pretending to be seemingly stranded motorist and a police officer who refuses to aid. The track begins with Mooseman and Ice-T driving their car towards a police car, and then Ice-T asks for the gun Mooseman has and tells Mooseman to stay in the car, much to Mooseman's chagrin, as Mooseman wanted to kill the cop in this round. Ice-T then walks up to the policeman, pretending to be a stranded motorist, asking for help, but the policeman refuses, saying: [...] "Nah, that's <b>not</b> <b>my</b> <b>job!</b> My job's not to help your fuckin' ass out!", then telling him that [...] "my job is eatin' these doughnuts". When the officer recognizes Ice-T, gunshots are heard. The final voice on the track is Ice-T confirming his identity.|$|E

2500|$|Dyer further {{stated that}} his {{intentions}} {{had been to}} strike terror throughout the Punjab and in doing so, reduce the moral stature of the [...] "rebels". He {{said he did not}} stop the shooting when the crowd began to disperse because he thought it was his duty to keep shooting until the crowd dispersed, and that a little shooting would not do any good. In fact he continued the shooting until the ammunition was almost exhausted. He stated that he did not make any effort to tend to the wounded after the shooting: [...] "Certainly not. It was <b>not</b> <b>my</b> <b>job.</b> Hospitals were open and they could have gone there." ...|$|E

6000|$|But now {{the reader}} will {{understand}} how it came about that, disappointed by the essential littleness of Liberalism, and disillusioned about the representative quality of the professed Socialists, I turned my mind {{more and more to}} a scrutiny of the big people, the wealthy and influential people, against whom Liberalism pits its forces. I was asking myself definitely whether, after all, it was <b>not</b> <b>my</b> particular <b>job</b> to work through them and not against them. Was I not altogether out of my element as an Anti-? Weren't there big bold qualities about these people that common men lack, and the possibility of far more splendid dreams?

5000|$|I {{think it}} applies to {{everybody}} who gets {{up in the morning}} and has to go out and do their job. Sometimes it’s not great being on tour. It’s a cliché now, but everyone knows what happens on the road. You have very little sleep, I usually go to sleep about four or five o’clock, then I have to get up at eight or nine o’clock, get a plane and go somewhere else and play. When the knock comes on the door, I know I have got to get up. It’s <b>not</b> just in <b>my</b> <b>job,</b> people who are electricians and work in Woolworth’s have to do it.|$|R

He owed nothing to Harford. [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> to defend his wife's reputation."

5000|$|On 23 November 2007, Tiger Airways criticised Qantas {{for being}} unable to provide ground {{handling}} services to the airline at Alice Springs Airport, forcing it to delay its launch to the city by three months to 1 March 2008. The airline had promised to pay any cost to Qantas, but services were still denied. Qantas executive general manager John Borghetti responded by saying [...] "assisting competitors is <b>not</b> part of <b>my</b> <b>job</b> description". Tiger Airways Australia CEO Tony Davis reminded Qantas that Tiger's parent, Singapore Airlines, provides ground servicing at Singapore Changi Airport for both Qantas and Jetstar, and it wasn't unreasonable for Qantas to provide Tiger the ground staff at Alice Springs.|$|R

A few months later Sabrina constantly hit the headlines when paparazzi revealed her relationship to former tennis star Boris Becker. The couple separated shortly afterwards, but due to conflicting rumours about anorexia Setlur's name maintained popular in magazines and papers. [...] "I was suddenly in the newspaper, <b>not</b> because of <b>my</b> <b>job,</b> only because we were together", said Setlur {{in an interview with}} online magazine Spiegel Online.
