25|$|Fungi {{that attack}} aphids include Neozygites fresenii, Entomophthora, Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium anisopliae, and entomopathogenic fungi such as Lecanicillium lecanii. Aphids brush against the {{microscopic}} spores. These spores {{stick to the}} aphid, germinate, and penetrate the aphid's skin. The fungus grows in the aphid hemolymph (i.e., the counterpart of blood for aphids). After about 3nbsp&days, the aphid dies and the fungus releases more spores into the air. Infected aphids are covered with a woolly mass that progressively grows thicker until the aphid is obscured. Often, the visible fungus is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> fungus that killed the aphid, but a secondary fungus.|$|E

The picture Moore bought was called Summer Painting, and Sutcliffe attended a formal dinner to celebrate the exhibition with another art student, Susan Williams. Murray remembered that the painting was painted on a board, not a canvas, and had to be cut into two pieces (because of its size) and hinged. Murray added that only one of the pieces actually got to the exhibition (because they stopped off in a pub to celebrate), but sold nonetheless because Moores bought it for his son.|$|E

The goal of this review is to provide perspective on biological applications using hybrids of nucleic acids and CNTs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{draws the}} {{attention}} of the Nigerian government to take vibrant steps towards addressing the problems of utilizing ICT in managing SMSEs in Nigeria. Fifty-seven (57) SMSEs were surveyed to identify the internally and externally-oriented problems of ICT usage. Two research questions and a hypothesis were analysed to determine whether or <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> problems are correlated. The findings revealed that lack of finance and poor facilities seemed to be the major obstacles to the effective usage of ICT. Although, the problems were more external in nature than internal but, the inefficient utilization of ICT is <b>not</b> contingent upon <b>the</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> problems as was revealed by the calculated value of the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (R).
