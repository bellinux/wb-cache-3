40|$|In the past, the {{phase-space}} elementary cell of a <b>non-quantized</b> <b>system</b> was {{set equal}} to the third power of the Planck constant; in fact, {{it is not a}} necessary assumption. We discuss how the phase space volume, the number of states and the elementary-cell volume of a system of non-interacting N particles, changes when an interaction is switched on and the system becomes or evolves to a system of correlated non-Boltzmann particles and derives the appropriate expressions. Even if we assume that nowadays the volume of the elementary cell is {{equal to the}} cube of the Planck constant, h 3, at least for quantum systems, we show that there is a correspondence between different values of h in the past, with important and, in principle, measurable cosmological and astrophysical consequences, and systems with an effective smaller (or even larger) phase-space volume described by non-extensive generalized statistics...|$|E
30|$|Despite {{quantization}} {{approach and}} its corresponding evaluation are considered mandatory tasks {{in the design}} flow and can take much time and effort, their presentation are rarely published in the literature. Only few number of works have illustrated the used quantization and fixed-point representation. In [9] and [10], {{the implementation of a}} low-complexity turbo-equalizer has been presented targeting a 16 -b fixed-point DSP device with two’s-complement arithmetic. The authors have focused on BPSK signal set and only presented its corresponding simulation results. In addition, the quantization of input and output values of the main modules constituting the equalizer has been given. The precise quantization of intermediate computation result values have not been shown. Moreover, the authors has focused on exploiting a given word length without illustrating the fixed-point representation. In [11], a fixed-point representation of MMSE-based turbo equalizer with soft cancelation (SC) has been presented. The authors have targeted specific constellation scheme (QPSK) and presented the performance comparison between a <b>non-quantized</b> <b>system</b> and quantized system for different system configuration. In [12], the previous work has been extended to 16 -QAM constellation scheme. With the help of extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts, the authors have determined the sufficient number of fractional bits.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a multipair amplify-and-forward massive MIMO relaying system with one-bit ADCs and one-bit DACs at the relay. The channel state information is estimated via pilot training, and then utilized by the relay to perform simple maximum-ratio combining/maximum-ratio transmission processing. Leveraging on the Bussgang decomposition, an exact achievable rate is derived {{for the system}} with correlated quantization noise. Based on this, a closed-form asymptotic approximation for the achievable rate is presented, thereby enabling efficient evaluation {{of the impact of}} key parameters on the system performance. Furthermore, power scaling laws are characterized to study the potential energy efficiency associated with deploying massive one-bit antenna arrays at the relay. In addition, a power allocation strategy is designed to compensate for the rate degradation caused by the coarse quantization. Our results suggest that the quality of the channel estimates depends on the specific orthogonal pilot sequences that are used, contrary to unquantized systems where any set of orthogonal pilot sequences gives the same result. Moreover, the sum rate gap between the double-quantized relay system and an ideal <b>non-quantized</b> <b>system</b> is a moderate factor of 4 /π^ 2 in the low power regime.
