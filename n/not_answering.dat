5|$|As a {{birthday}} gift for Marge, Homer buys a blender designed by television chef Paula Paul. He {{goes to a}} health food store called Swapper Jack's, where Paula is giving away autographs, to have Paula sign it. Homer is impressed by the store and {{says he will not}} be shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart any more. Apu, who is there to spy, overhears Homer and the two engage in a fight until the security guards grab hold of Apu and take him away. At the signing, Homer tells Paula that Marge is a big fan of hers. Paula decides that she will call Marge live during her upcoming show to wish her a happy birthday. Meanwhile, Bart gets his mother a rabbit for her birthday. The rabbit chews through the phone lines in the Simpsons' home, causing Marge to miss Paula's call. Paula becomes furious at Marge for <b>not</b> <b>answering</b> the phone as she embarrassed herself on her show. Homer punishes Bart by locking him up in the rabbit's cage.|$|E
5|$|Sarah {{was called}} to Cambridge in 1703, where her only {{surviving}} son, John, Marquess of Blandford, was taken ill with smallpox. The Duke of Marlborough was recalled from the war and was at his bedside when he died on 20 February 1703. Sarah was heartbroken {{over the loss of}} her son and became reclusive for a period, expressing her grief by closing herself off from Anne and either <b>not</b> <b>answering</b> her letters or doing so in a cold and formal manner. However, Sarah did not allow Anne to shut her out when Anne suffered bereavement. After the death of Anne's husband, Prince George of Denmark in 1708, Sarah arrived, uninvited, at Kensington Palace to find Anne with the prince's body. She pressed the heartbroken Queen to move from Kensington to St James's Palace in London, which Anne bluntly refused, and instead commanded Sarah to call Abigail Masham to attend her. Aware that Abigail was gaining more influence with Anne, Sarah disobeyed her, and instead scolded her for grieving over Prince George's death. Although Anne eventually submitted and allowed herself to be taken to St James's Palace, Sarah's insensitivity greatly offended her and added to the already significant strain on the relationship.|$|E
25|$|The return seemed difficult, as many {{ships were}} damaged and Mansilla was {{rearming}} {{the north of}} San Lorenzo, so they requested Montevideo to send reinforcements. The Philomel advanced at full speed, <b>not</b> <b>answering</b> fire whenever possible, reaching Montevideo in few days. The British steamboats Lizard and Harpy moved to reunite with the convoy. Those ships, however, stopped at Quebracho and returned fire, and the Lizard was badly damaged as a result.|$|E

25|$|In September Musquito was escorting a small convoy off {{the north}} coast of Cuba when at daybreak she sighted some strange vessels. When it became {{apparent}} that the vessels were frigates and that they were <b>not</b> <b>answering</b> private signals, Musquito signaled to her charges that they should flee; She herself made for Puerto Padre, with the frigates in pursuit. She crossed the bar and anchored just inside. However, when the pursuers crossed the bar and anchored some 300 to 400 yards away, she surrendered. Her captors were the Spanish frigates Medea (44 guns), Esmerelda (34 guns), and Santa Clara (34 guns).|$|E
25|$|Dorothy was {{to pick up}} {{her sister}} Louise after seeing Snider and never showed, which was very unlike her. Around 11 pm, Snider's private {{investigator}} called Cushner on his private line, saying that he had been trying to call Snider for several hours, but Snider was <b>not</b> <b>answering.</b> Although there were many guests in the residence, Snider's bedroom door was closed and they assumed Snider's privacy was essential. Cushner broke into Snider's room and discovered the nude bodies of Snider and Stratten, both having been shot with a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun, which Snider had recently acquired. Police determined that Snider murdered Stratten, who was 20, then abused and raped her corpse, before turning the shotgun on himself. Dorothy's body was found connected to an odd, homemade sexual contraption and both bodies were covered with ants.|$|E
25|$|The {{tenor of}} the bishop's {{complaints}} is surprising, as Chetwynd was often guilty of much worse than financial ineptitude. It seems that he maintained an armed retinue {{and he was not}} afraid to use it. In 1316 Vivian de Staundon robbed a royal official who was carrying a large sum of money to Ireland on behalf of Edward II Chetwynd, together with John Ipstones, a local baron, raised a large force of armed men to prevent Staundon's arrest and then sheltered him from justice, absorbing him into their own retinues. Warrants were issued for the arrest of both of them but, although Ipstones was apprehended, Chetwynd escaped and went to ground, evading several attempts to bring him to court, and the matter seems to have lapsed. In 1321 he again evaded justice by the simple expedient of <b>not</b> <b>answering</b> the summons, when the king prosecuted him for falsely claiming immunity from tolls and harbour dues in London. Despite his criminal history, when he retired in 1330, Chetwynd was allowed the revenues of two manors, Blackfordby and Freasley, and of two churches, as well as his food, fuel, candles, two horses, a capacious lodging at the abbey and hospitality for his guests. Even this was not enough for him: the disgruntled ex-abbot seized the abbey by force and pillaged it. The matter was only resolved when Edward III sent in keepers to restore order. This marked a low point in the reputation of the abbey.|$|E

25|$|Frankland {{carried his}} academy with {{him back to}} Rathmell, and during the {{remaining}} nine {{years of his life}} he admitted nearly as many students as in the whole previous period of over nineteen years. His congregation also throve, and he maintained harmony among its members {{at a time when many}} were beginning to relax their hold of the Calvinism to which he himself adhered. But while the Toleration Act protected him as a preacher, hardly a year passed without some fresh attempt on the part of the authorities to put down his academy. For <b>not</b> <b>answering</b> a citation to the archbishop's (Lamplugh) court he was again excommunicated; at the instance of Lord Wharton and Sir Thomas Rokeby, William III ordered his absolution, which was read in Giggleswick Church. Soon after the consecration of Sharp as archbishop of York (5 July 1691) new alarm was excited by the assembling of twenty-four nonconformist ministers at Wakefield (2 September) to consider the ‘heads of agreement’ sent down from London as an irenicon (a proposition or device for securing peace) between the presbyterian and independent sections. Frankland was the senior minister present, and earnestly promoted the union. Next year the clergy of Craven petitioned Sharp to suppress the academy. Sharp wrote to Tillotson for advice. Tillotson evidently did not like the business, and suggested to Sharp (14 June 1692), as ‘the fairest and softest way of ridding’ his ‘hands of’ it, that he should see Frankland and explain that the objection to licensing his academy was not based upon his nonconformity. His school was not required in the district, and it was contrary to the bishop's oath to license public instruction in ‘university learning.’ Sharp saw Frankland after a confirmation at Skipton and invited the nonconformist to Bishopthorpe. Here, with the help of a pipe of tobacco and a glass of good wine, a very friendly interview took place in the library, Sharp courteously declining controversy and inviting confidential hints about the state of the diocese (according to Frankland in a latter to Ralph Thoresby, 6 November 1694). The archbishop's goodwill did not stop further proceedings. From a letter of Richard Stretton, presbyterian minister at Haberdashers' Hall, London, to Thoresby, it appears that early in 1695 there was a prosecution against Frankland; on 10 February the indictment was quashed. In 1697 he was brought before the spiritual court, but at Michaelmas the case was postponed, apparently by the archbishop's order. Calamy states that his troubles continued till the year of his death, but no further particulars are available. Oliver Heywood's diaries are full of references to the academy and its students, and to Frankland's labours at ordinations.|$|E

At the door of St Paul's Cathedral, they had an argument that culminated in Sarah offending the Queen by telling her to be quiet. Anne was dismayed. When Sarah forwarded an unrelated letter from her husband to Anne, with a covering note continuing the argument, Anne wrote back pointedly, [...] "After the commands you gave me on the thanksgiving day of <b>not</b> <b>answering</b> you, I should not have troubled you with these lines, but to return the Duke of Marlborough's letter safe into your hands, and {{for the same reason}} do not say anything to that, nor to yours which enclosed it." ...|$|E
500|$|Two former PayPal employees, Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons, founded Yelp at a {{business}} incubator, MRL Ventures, in 2004. Stoppelman and Simmons conceived the initial idea for Yelp as an email-based referral network, after Stoppelman caught the flu {{and had a}} difficult time finding an online recommendation for a local doctor. The co-founders' former colleague from PayPal and founder of MRL Ventures, Max Levchin, provided $1 million in initial funding. MRL co-founder David Galbraith, who instigated the local services project based on user reviews, came up with the name [...] "Yelp". According to Fortune Magazine, Yelp's initial email-based system was [...] "convoluted". The idea was rejected by investors and did not attract users beyond the cofounders' friends and family. Usage data showed that users were <b>not</b> <b>answering</b> requests for referrals, but were using the [...] "Real Reviews" [...] feature, which allowed them to write reviews unsolicited.|$|E
500|$|Unusual visual allegory in this Tory panegyric of Charles II and the House of Stuart {{includes}} a figure representing the radical Whig leader Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury [...] "with fiend's wings, and snakes twisted round his body; he is encompassed by several fanatical rebellious heads, who suck poison from him, which {{runs out of}} a tap in his side." [...] In an investor's nightmare, while Dryden's propaganda piece was in preparation, Charles II died, James II succeeded him, and the Monmouth Rebellion which Shaftesbury had fomented broke out. On the very day of the premiere, June 3, 1685, the Duke of Monmouth landed in the west. [...] "The nation being in a great consternation", recollected Downes, [...] "it was performed but six times, which <b>not</b> <b>answering</b> half the charge they were at, involved the company very much in debt." [...] This traumatic fiasco ruled out all further operatic spectacle investment until the calmer times after the Glorious Revolution of 1689.|$|E

500|$|In {{his search}} for the Black Hand, Talion allies himself with Hirgon, a ranger deserter who leads a {{community}} of Gondorian outcasts choosing to settle in Mordor, and Ratbag the Coward (Phil LaMarr), an Orc who offers to bring Talion closer to the Black Hand {{in exchange for his}} assistance in climbing Mordor's military hierarchy. Talion helps Ratbag ascend the ranks to the level of warchief by killing each of his immediate superiors, finally becoming Warchief himself. Talion then goes after the other Warchiefs in Udun, weakening Sauron's forces in that area. Soon enough, Hirgon has a plan to draw out the Black Captains. Using acquired grog and blasting powder, Talion helps the Outcasts destroy a statue dedicated to Sauron. Instead of the Black Hand answering the [...] "message", the Hammer of Sauron is sent, punishing Ratbag for <b>not</b> <b>answering</b> his duties to kill the ranger. Talion and The Hammer then face off, with packs of Uruk joining the fight, but after a savage battle, Talion manages to kill The Hammer.|$|E

Amy Macdonald, in her song [...] "Let's Start a Band" [...] referenced Glastonbury: [...] "Give me a festival and I'll be your Glastonbury star." [...] Robbie Williams, in his song [...] "The 90s", refers to his surprise appearance on stage with Oasis in 1995, which ultimately led to him leaving Take That: [...] "Everybody's worried 'what the fuck's wrong with Robbie? He's <b>not</b> <b>answering</b> his phone, he's not talking to me, I saw him on the telly at Glastonbury'." [...] Joe Strummer wrote the song [...] "Coma Girl" [...] about his experiences at Glastonbury, — in a BBC interview Bruce Springsteen cited the song as inspiring him to play the 2009 festival. U2 wrote a song titled [...] "Glastonbury" [...] {{that was supposed to}} premier with their appearance at the festival, but an injury to Bono forced them to cancel. They instead premiered it in a concert in Turin on their 360° Tour. Marcus Brigstocke's comic creation Giles Wemmbley Hogg had a special mock-documentary made about him going to Glastonbury as part of the Giles Wemmbley-Hogg Goes Off series. Deborah Crombie's novel A Finer End takes place in Glastonbury with references to a fictional account of an original 1914 Glastonbury Fayre as well as the contemporary festival. Glastonbury is also a setting in John Osborne's 2014 Radio 4 show The New Blur Album. Roxy Music did a song and album called Avalon, which is the ancient name for Glastonbury (Isle of Avalon).|$|E
