This was implemented by the Information and Consultation Directive 2002 (2002/14/EC) in part. The French Labour Code, article L. 1111-3 excluded workers with <b>non-standard</b> <b>employment</b> contracts from staff numbers to determine legal thresholds for constituting bodies representing staff.

50|$|Precarious work is <b>non-standard</b> <b>employment</b> that {{is poorly}} paid, insecure, unprotected, and cannot support a household. In recent decades {{there has been}} a {{dramatic}} increase in precarious work due to such factors as globalization, the shift from the manufacturing sector to the service sector, and the spread of information technology. These changes have created a new economy which demands flexibility in the workplace and, as a result, caused the decline of the standard employment relationship and a dramatic increase in precarious work. An important aspect of precarious work is its gendered nature, as women are continuously over-represented in this type of work.|$|E

40|$|In {{construction}} and engineering, workers from different organisations work together, often on a project-by-project basis. Drawing on the theoretical framework of inequality regimes as presented by Acker (2006 a), and the externalisation of employment relations presented by Kalleberg et. al. (2003), this article investigates the gendered {{implications of the}} externalisation of technological work in the construction industry. The empirical material is based upon interviews and a questionnaire answered by regular employees, contracted staff and independent contractors working in the construction industry. The data reveal how <b>non-standard</b> <b>employments</b> are parts of the organising processes that produce gendered inequalities between core and peripheral workers.

50|$|Scholars {{have argued}} that {{neoliberal}} policies have been a prominent component in {{the erosion of the}} standard employment relationship. This precarious new model of employment has greatly reduced the worker’s ability to negotiate and, in particular, with the introduction of advanced technology (that can easily replace the worker), reduced the temp’s bargaining power. Internet of Things-based companies such as Uber have come into conflict with authorities and workers for circumventing labour and social security obligations. It has been suggested that labour regulations in North America do little in addressing labour market insecurities and the precarious nature of temporary labour. In many cases, legislation has done little to acknowledge or adapt to the growth of <b>non-standard</b> <b>employment</b> in Canada.|$|E
50|$|While {{contingent}} {{labor has}} been a constant of capitalist societies since the industrial revolution, Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri have argued that the flexible labor force has now moved from the peripheral position it had under Fordism to a core position in the process of capitalist accumulation under Post-Fordism, which is thought to be increasingly based on the casualized efforts of affective, creative, immaterial labor. There is scattered empirical evidence in support of this thesis, such as the growing share of <b>non-standard</b> <b>employment</b> on the overall labor force, particularly on new hires. For example, in Western Europe, between a quarter and a third of the labor force now works under temporary and/or part-time contracts, with peaks in UK, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy.|$|E
30|$|A further {{change in}} the {{structure}} of the German labor market is related to the rising share of <b>non-standard</b> <b>employment.</b> <b>Non-standard</b> <b>employment</b> comprises part-time and minor employment as well as employment with all types of fixed-term contracts. It should be emphasized that not all forms of <b>non-standard</b> <b>employment</b> imply low-quality jobs. For example, part-time work might be voluntarily chosen for family reasons. The same applies to some fixed-term contracts when they correspond to the preferences of workers.

40|$|The {{growth in}} <b>non-standard</b> forms of <b>employment</b> has major {{implications}} for the effectiveness of employee participation mechanisms in the workplace, whether direct or indirect (representative). This seems to be especially the case with representative forms, such as consultative committees, because they effectively assume permanent or long-term employment and are not as easily accessible to part-time employees. However, the literature on participation rarely addresses this major contextual aspect. The issue is of further significance since the majority of part-time and casual employees are female. Consequently, {{to the extent that}} non-standard employees {{do not have the same}} access to participatory mechanisms in the workplace that their full- time permanent colleagues enjoy, then women also are disproportionately excluded from participation. This paper begins to redress the insularity in the literature by analysing survey data from the Illawarra Regional Industrial Relations Survey (IRWIRS).

Little is known, however, about how histories of <b>non-standard</b> <b>employment</b> – part-time work, temporary agency employment, and skills underemployment – shape workers ’ future labor market opportunities. Drawing on original field- and survey-experimental data, {{this article examines}} three interrelated questions: 1) What are the consequences of having a <b>non-standard</b> <b>employment</b> history for workers ’ future labor market opportunities?; 2) Given the gendered history of <b>non-standard</b> <b>employment</b> in the United States, do the consequences of these labor market positions differ {{for male and female}} workers?; and 3) What mechanisms account for the consequences of having a <b>non-standard</b> <b>employment</b> history?

Then, we investigate the effect of having a <b>non-standard</b> <b>employment</b> con-tract on job advantages in terms of wages.

40|$|Temporary agency {{workers are}} coming under <b>non-standard</b> <b>employments,</b> who have {{temporary}} {{attachment to the}} working organization. With dynamic business environment and flexible work arrangements, temporary agency employments are also emerged in Sri Lanka. Temporary agency workers are dual committed employees. However, with this dual commitment, organizations face issues in achieving temporary agency workers’ commitment due to low attention of agencies to temporary agency workers. Even though the Client organization provides due attention to temporary agency workers, they fail to receive due commitment {{due to the lack}} of attention from agency to temporary agency workers. This study was conducted to identify the agency related factors affecting temporary agency workers’ commitment. This was carried out as a cross sectional field study with a sample of 93 workers from temporary agency works in the ABC (pvt) ltd. 93 temporary agency workers were selected as sample. Data were collected via a standard questionnaire that met accepted standards of validity and reliability. Descriptive statistics, Simple ranking, Factor analysis, ANOVA and Independent Sample T-Test technique were performed to analyze data. No of Temporary workers to supervisor (temp to consult ratio) is the most influencing factor of temporary agency workers’ commitment in agency context. Job satisfaction, agency support, side bets, interactional justice, lack of alternative employments, procedural justice, distributive justice, reciprocity norm acceptance, socialization, breach of psychological contract, lack of skill transferability are the other factors, which are ordered from most influencing factor to less affecting factor to workers’ organizational commitment. Findings revealed that eleven out of thirteen factors are job related factors, other two are organization related and person related factors. Most client companies provide their attention, while agencies fail to provide their due attention. It shows, it is useless to expect temporary agency workers’ commitment without providing due attention from agency. Therefore, the more dually committed the temporary agency workers are, the more eligible they are to receive dual attention from client as well as from their agency...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This article brings {{together}} findings from two studies {{that focus on}} child care in Canada. The first maps the coverage of child care over {{the first decade of}} the 21 st century in four Canadian daily newspapers. It shows that the voices of children, mothers, and child care providers are virtually absent from policy discussions. The second study, which remedies the parental invisibility identified by the first study, relies on interviews with mothers of young children in two jurisdictions with distinctive approaches to child care – the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec. This article looks at the impact on gender roles, identities, and relations of the rise in women’s <b>non-standard,</b> service-sector <b>employment</b> and compares the complex task of creating and managing formal and informal non-parental child care in rural and semi-rural communities in the two policy jurisdictions (Ontario and Quebec).

Overall fewer women work than men in Canada; with the largest gaps in urban centres with high costs of childcare. This gender inequality exists within a regulatory system and public social programs that reinforce gender stereotypes; and, a labour market that is rapidly shifting towards <b>non-standard</b> <b>employment.</b> This project had two goals. First, to support a human-centred design approach to developing gender equality through developing public policy, workplace practices, and social innovations. And second, to extend the understanding of how and why parents are constructing their earning and parenting roles in a variety of <b>non-standard</b> <b>employment</b> relationships Seven heterosexual couples and one single mother who are working in <b>non-standard</b> <b>employment</b> arrangements were interviewed to understand their motivations and decision factors regarding paid employment, domestic and parenting activities; what they are looking for in earning arrangements; the challenges and benefits of their current arrangements; and, future aspirations and concerns. The qualitative data from those interviews were used to identify to identify implications, an overall problem challenge, a set of innovation opportunities, design principles and a set of future research areas. The parents interviewed in this project are using <b>non-standard</b> <b>employment</b> relationships to meet their own earning and parenting goals of maximizing their time with their children and both being involved parents while doing gender differently. These parents’ choices are consistent with a shifting view of domestic sharing, gender equality and a revaluing of caregiving activities in society.
