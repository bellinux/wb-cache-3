Increased use of welding was proposed as a possible way to reduce weight and bolster the structural design, as it could have reduced the ships' structural weight by 10%, but it was utilized in only about 30% of the ship. The costs associated with welding {{and an increase in}} the time of construction made it impractical.|$|E
5|$|Owens did {{not have}} time to {{complete}} the shot before the Cannes screenings, but afterwards he used cineSync to conduct most of the work from home. The shot includes two blocks of computer-generated buildings that recede into the distance of a downtown set extension. As Collins disappears into the crowd about a minute into the shot, the live footage is gradually joined with more digital work. The streetcars, tracks and power lines were all computer generated. Live-action extras appear for the first minute of the shot before being replaced by digital ones. The shot was made more complicated by the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> Massive extras. Owens constructed the scene by first building the digital foreground around the live action footage. He then added the background before filling the scene with vehicles and people.|$|E

With each Dream Chronicles game, Dream Jewels were used differently. In The Book of Air there was a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> these powers and a need to have a new use for the Jewels and they just fit together perfectly. After the Standard Edition of the game was released, Sindledecker uploaded a special walkthrough for The Book of Air on PlayFirst's blog.|$|E
25|$|The Caeliar {{offer the}} {{remaining}} humans a merging {{of human and}} Caeliar, to allow both groups to survive. The human survivors are resistant and as time goes on, the Caeliar called Sedin becomes the sole survivor of her group, her mental processes and her form both degrading as time goes on. When the humans return to Sedin for help, she forces them to merge with her, unwilling to allow herself to die when a union can save her life. The forced merging of the humans and the mostly decayed Caeliar results {{in the creation of}} the first Borg, the name being created due to the fragmented thought of the first drone as he was assimilated (his last thought was that he would not become some cyborg, with his individuality ceasing before he could finish thinking the final word). The gestalt group mind is perverted to become the collective, driven by Sedin's desperate hunger and <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> the strength, technology, and life-force of others to her own. Ironically, while the Caeliar were–albeit accidentally–involved {{in the creation of the}} Borg, they also provide the means to end it; in the 24th century, the Caeliar absorb the entire Borg collective back into themselves, ending the cyborgs' centuries-long reign of terror.|$|E

500|$|In 1940, after {{receiving}} a request in March of that year from the Ministry of Aircraft Production for a high-rated (...) Merlin for use as an alternative engine to the turbocharged Hercules VIII used in the prototype high-altitude Vickers Wellington V bomber, Rolls-Royce started experiments {{on the design of}} a two-stage supercharger and an engine fitted with this was bench-tested in April 1941, eventually becoming the Merlin 60. The basic design used a modified Vulture supercharger for the first stage while a Merlin 46 supercharger was used for the second. A liquid-cooled intercooler on top of the supercharger casing was used to prevent the compressed air/fuel mixture from becoming too hot. Also considered was an exhaust-driven turbocharger but, although a lower fuel consumption was an advantage the added weight and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> extra ducting for the exhaust flow and waste-gates, meant that this option was rejected in favour of the two-stage supercharger.
