40|$|<b>New</b> Zealand <b>Wool</b> Production and Disposal New Zealand is {{the third}} largest producer, and second largest exporter, of wool in the world. Over {{the past thirty years}} <b>New</b> Zealand's <b>wool</b> {{production}} has more than doubled. Since 1967 / 68, however, a marked decline has occurred in the rate at which wool production was increasing. This decline may be attributed primarily to present economic and managerial advantages of expanding beef production, rather than sheep production, {{in many parts of the}} country. Wool provides an important source of export earnings for <b>New</b> Zealand. <b>Wool</b> exports in 1970, valued at $ 204. 5 million, constituted 19 % of the total New Zealand earnings from export produce. 1. Source: Department of Statistics (3), p. 567. This places wool third in importance, after meat and dairy produce, as an export earner. The bulk of the <b>New</b> Zealand <b>wool</b> clip is sold at auction in New Zealand and exported in the greasy state. The major markets for <b>New</b> Zealand <b>wool</b> are the United Kingdom, the U. S. A., Japan, Belgium, France, Italy, and the U. S. S. R. Local mill purchases take only a small proportion of the wool clip...|$|R

50|$|Woolmark is a {{trademark}} owned by Australian Wool Innovation Limited (AWI).

A United Kingdom subsidiary was developing the group's agricultural and trading interests within the UK.To shore up declining profit margins various decisions were made. Multi-storey wool stores on valuable sites were sold off {{and replaced with}} single storey buildings on city outskirts. The single storey stores allowed the operation of modern more efficient handling machinery but the sale of old stores did not pay for <b>new</b> <b>wool</b> stores and Dalgety raised more capital by issuing debentures to investors in London.|$|E
50|$|From the mid-1960s, {{changing}} economic pressures, {{the advent}} of containerism, technological advances in core sampling of wool, and improved breeding standards, caused the wool industry to change to single-level storage, labour-saving methods and computer trading, few of which were feasible at Teneriffe. The pastoral company {{which was the first}} to move into the Teneriffe area was also the first to move out. In 1961 Dalgety & Co. Ltd merged with New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company, and as Dalgety & New Zealand Loan Ltd, in 1964 built a <b>new</b> <b>wool</b> centre at Rocklea, selling the redundant Teneriffe No 3 woolstore to Queensland Primary Producers.|$|E

This research has suggested that New Zealand textile design has been under-utilised as a means of adding value to this commodity and set out to investigate how design in conjunction with technology and marketing could create a new product idea and propose a new story. Investigations into design, technology and marketing were carried out within a generic product design framework for a defined textile interior product. Research ceased at the point at which a product story could be proposed. Woven prototypes developed through studio practice explored a 3 D contoured aesthetic for <b>New</b> Zealand <b>wool</b> fabrics incorporating specialist yarn technology, and manufacturing capabilities were assessed to determine whether New Zealand industry could feasibly produce the resultant fabrics.

5000|$|The S number {{often is}} used in {{conjunction}} with the word [...] "super" [...] which originally meant the best wool, (called choice wool in the United States) [...] As now used Super means pure <b>new</b> <b>wool</b> and can also be used for fabrics made from wool blended with rare fiber (such as mohair, cashmere wool and alpaca), and also with silk. The inclusion of Elastane to give the fabric a stretch effect is permitted, as also is the inclusion of up to 5% non-wool yarn for decorative effects. For wool blend fabric descriptions, the word Super is not permitted. Subject to the wool content being at least 45%, the S number may be used.|$|E

50|$|In December 1842 {{he moved}} to Melbourne, which had only {{recently}} been established, and became manager of a <b>new</b> <b>wool</b> trading firm. Dalgety soon secured a partnership in the business, and, when his partners left the firm, he formed his own company, Dalgety and Company, in 1846. Dalgety and Company outfitted sheep ranchers with supplies and financed them in anticipation of yearly wool sales. The firm then shipped wool to England. By 1848 he was an independent and well-to-do merchant, concentrating on 'the settlers' trade', providing merchandise for the squatters and buying their produce. He visited England in 1849 to strengthen his facilities for credit and the disposal of colonial produce and returned to Victoria in 1851. In the gold rush, Dalgety continued with general business, enlarged his pastoral trade, sold merchandise to the diggers and bought much gold from them. Between 1851-55 he made about £150,000 from his gold speculations alone. At this time he lived at Como House in Melbourne which he bought in 1852, but sold it within a year.|$|E
