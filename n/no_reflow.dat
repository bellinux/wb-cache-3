40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{in humans}} the temporal patterns of <b>no</b> <b>reflow</b> and their functional implications. METHODS: 24 patients with first {{acute myocardial infarction}} and successful coronary recanalisation by recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (n = 15) or primary {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} (n = 9) were studied by myocardial contrast echocardiography within 24 hours of recanalisation and at one month's follow up. Myocardial contrast echocardiography was performed by intermittent harmonic power Doppler and intravenous Levovist. The regional contrast score index (CSI) was calculated within dysfunctioning myocardium. Videointensity was measured (dB) within risk and control areas and their ratio was calculated. RESULTS: In 8 patients reflow was observed at 24 hours and persisted at one month. Conversely in 16 patients areas of <b>no</b> <b>reflow</b> were detectable at 24 hours. At one month, <b>no</b> <b>reflow</b> was spontaneously reversible in 9 patients (mean (SD) CSI and videointensity ratio improved from 2. 5 (0. 5) to 1. 4 (0. 6) and from 0. 6 (0. 1) to 0. 7 (0. 1), respectively; p < 0. 05) and was sustained in the remaining 7 patients (CSI and videointensity ratio remained unchanged from 2. 6 (0. 6) to 2. 6 (0. 5) and from 0. 5 (0. 2) to 0. 5 (0. 2), respectively; NS).

This phenomenon is called no-reflow.

40|$|Background: The term no-reflow {{was first}} used by Majno and colleagues {{in the setting of}} {{cerebral}} ischemia in 1967. This phenomenon was initially described by Krug et al. during induced myocardial infarction in the canine model in 1966 and again by Kloner et al. in 1974 in which it occurred for 90 min after temporary epicardial coronary artery occlusion. Myocardial tracers, such as carbon black or thioflavin S were injected to document uniform flow distribution across the myocardial tissue after 40 min of occlusion. After 90 min, persistent subendocardial perfusion defects were seen with no-reflow. Objectives: Detection, prevention, and treatment of no-refloware likely to have an important impact on the outcome of PPCI. Here we propose possible personalized forms of prevention and treatment, {{on the basis of the}} notion that no-reflow is a dynamic process characterized by multiple pathogenetic components. Methods: We analyzed a total of 120 consecutive patients with STEMI and treated with PPCI between 1 st of November 2016 to July 2017 at our institution. The patients are divided into two groups according to the final TIMI flow after the primary PCI, and the incidence of in hospital MACE as follows: Group A: had a normal flow after the PPCI and did not have in hospital MACE; Group B: had either <b>no</b> <b>reflow</b> after the PPCI or experienced in hospital MACE. Results: The incidence of <b>no</b> <b>reflow</b> was 13. 2 %, and in hospital MACE was 5 %, with cardiac death as the predominant form of in hospital MACE. The group with <b>no</b> <b>reflow</b> or in hospital MACE showed significantly older age, longer door to balloon time, higher levels of admission RPG, N/L ratio, and MPV. Compared to the literature, Egyptian patients had more diabetes mellitus, more dyslipidaemia, longer door to balloon time. Conclusions: Older patient age, longer door to balloon time, admission hyperglycemia, higher admission N/L ratio, MPV, longer reperfusion time, elevated level of high sensitive CRP on admission, and markedly elevated levels of CKMB, large thrombus burden LTB, are useful predictive factors for the occurrence of <b>no</b> <b>reflow</b> post PPCI, and/or in hospital MACE...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecent {{studies suggest}} that {{neutrophil}} accumulation and activation in postischemic myocardium {{may be responsible for}} myocardial <b>no</b> <b>reflow,</b> which is characterized by an incomplete restoration of blood flow after reperfusion. To examine this further, 11 open chest, anesthetized dogs received bolus injections of a bovine neutrophil antiserum that produced an average 81 ± 5 % depletion of circulating neutrophils, and 10 control dogs received nonimmune serum. Each animal underwent 2 h of left circumflex artery occlusion followed by 4 h of reperfusion. Simultaneous two-dimensional echocardiography and radioactive microsphere blood flow studies were performed at baseline, 2 h of occlusion and early (∼ 5 min) and 4 h of reperfusion. During occlusion, both groups developed similar reductions in myocardial blood flow and levels of ischemic zone myocardial wall thinning. At early reperfusion, similar levels of hyperemia and regional hypokinesia were observed for both groups. By late reperfusion, both groups experienced significant <b>no</b> <b>reflow</b> in the subendocardium (p < 0. 05) and reduced reflow in the mid-myocardium.

40|$|Background: <b>No</b> <b>reflow</b> and {{decreased}} microvascular perfusion after percutaneous coronary intervention increase {{morbidity and mortality}} in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. <b>No</b> <b>reflow</b> may be mediated by platelet vessel wall interaction that is governed by von Willebrand factor. ADAMTS 13 is a metalloprotease that cleaves von Willebrand factor, thereby reducing its prohemostatic properties. There is considerable evidence that ADAMTS 13 levels decrease and von Willebrand factor levels increase in STEMI patients. Recombinant ADAMTS 13 has been effective in reducing cerebral infarct size in a murine model of stroke. Aims: In this study recombinant ADAMTS 13 was tested as a potential treatment of <b>no</b> <b>reflow</b> in a porcine model of cardiac ischemia and reperfusion. Methods: In 23 female swine (median age 83 days, median weight 30 kg) a balloon was inflated in the circumflex coronary artery for 75 min. Fifteen minutes after reperfusion, an intracoronary bolus of either recombinant ADAMTS 13 (400 U/kg, Baxter Innovations Vienna, Austria) or vehicle was given. Results: ADAMTS 13 activity significantly increased in treated pigs (from median 18 %, IQR 14. 5 - 24. 0 to median 324 %, IQR 117. 0 - 384. 0, P = 0. 003) whereas no change was observed in the control group.

40|$|AbstractDuring reperfusion of a {{myocardial}} infarct, {{development of}} microvascular occlusion {{may result in}} regional hypoperfusion (“no reflow”) despite a patent infarct-related artery. This study examined the extent and time course of <b>no</b> <b>reflow</b> with use of rubidium- 82 positron emission tomography. In 12 anesthetized dogs, the left anterior coronary artery was occluded for 90 min and then freely reperfused. Regional myocardial perfusions was imaged by serial rabidium- 82 positron emission tomography during coronary occlusion and every 30 min during reperfusion. After 4 h of reperfusion, infarct size and <b>no</b> <b>reflow</b> zone were measured postmortem by triphenyltetrazolium and thioflavin staining, respectively. Perfusion defects evident on rubidium- 82 images during coronary occlusion rapidly resolved during the early reflow period. However, a recurrent perfusion defect appeared after 1 to 2 h of reflow in all dogs. The severity of recurrent perfusion defects progressed with time; after 5 min of reflow, relative perfusion in the left anterior descending artery territory was 97 ± 6 % {{of that in the}} normal circumflex artery region, but perfusion decreased progressively to 68 ± 5 % after 2 h (p < 0. 05) and to 55 ± 4 % after 4 h of reperfusion (p < 0. 05 versus 2 h). As measured by radioactive tracer microspheres, endocardial blood flow decreased similarly in the postischemic left anterior descending artery region from 1. 2 ± 0. 2 ml/mim per g after 5 min of reflow to 0. 4 ± 0. 1 ml/min per g after 3 h of reflow (p < 0. 01). Residual infarct perfusion, measured by rabidium- 82 after 4 h of reflow, was related to both infarct size (r = − 0. 88) and the extent of the <b>no</b> <b>reflow</b> zone (r = − 0. 84) in the postmortem left ventricular sections. Thus, serial positron emission tomography with rabidium- 82 demonstrates a progressive loss of infarct perfusion, beginning 1 to 2 h after initial restoration of blood flow despite patency of the infarct-related artery. This phenomenon is probably a manifestation of progressive microvascular occlusion within the reperfused myocardium...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose—Stroke-related tissue {{pressure}} {{increase in the}} core and penumbra determines regional cerebral perfusion pressure (rCPP) defined as a difference between local inflow pressure and venous or tissue pressure, whichever is higher. We previously showed that venous pressure reduction below the pressure in the core causes blood flow diversion–cerebral venous steal. Now we investigated how transition to collateral circulation after complete arterial occlusion affects rCPP distribution. Methods—We modified parallel Starling resistor model to simulate transition to collateral inflow after complete main stem occlusion. We decreased venous pressure from the arterial pressure to zero and investigated how arterial and venous pressure elevation augments rCPP. Results—When core pressure exceeded venous, rCPPinflow pressure in the core. Venous pressure decrease from arterial pressure to pressure in the core caused smaller inflow pressure to drop augmenting rCPP. Further drop of venous pressure decreased rCPP in the core but augmented rCPP in penumbra. After transition to collateral circulation, lowering venous pressure below pressure in the penumbra further decreased rCPP and collaterals themselves became a pathway for steal. Venous pressure level at which rCPP in the core becomes zero we termed the “point of <b>no</b> <b>reflow.</b> ” Transition from direct to collateral circulation resulted in decreased inflow pressure, decreased rCPP, and a shift of point of <b>no</b> <b>reflow</b> to higher venous loading values.

40|$|After {{several hours}} of {{ischemia}} an incomplete return of blood flow {{has been reported in}} brain, kidney, skeletal muscle, and heart. The mechanisms responsible for the no-reflow phenomenon have been unclear, and perivascular edema, platelet or red cell plugs, and interstitial hemorrhage have been implicated. In the present study evidence is provided that leukocyte entrapment in capillaries might contribute to <b>no</b> <b>reflow.</b> Leukocytes are large and stiff cells, which adhere to vascular endothelium naturally and are known to alter in their adherence properties under a variety of conditions. Accordingly, 11 open-chest dogs were studied, 1 - 5 hours after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. Reperfusion (9 dogs) at 75 mm Hg arterial pressure was accomplished with Ringer's lactate and carbon suspension as a marker for capillary patency. In non-ischemic tissue, 98 % of the capillaries contained carbon, rare leukocytes, and few erythrocytes, whereas tissue from the distribution of the occluded artery was heterogeneous: 60 % of the capillaries had no carbon, high hematocrits, and approximately one leukocyte per unbranched capillary; 40 % demonstrated reflow and no leukocytes. A significant correlation between capillaries without carbon (<b>no</b> <b>reflow)</b> and the frequency of leukocytes remaining in these capillaries indicated that leukocytes were present in obstructed capillaries. Furthermore, the frequency of leukocytes remaining after the washout with lactate was ten times greater than in normal arrested heart muscle without washout.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Distal {{protection}} devices are increasingly {{used to prevent}} embolization during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in saphenous vein grafts (SVG) and native coronary arteries (NV). During interventions with the Filterwire device we have observed reduced flow that is reversible following removal of the filter (filter <b>no</b> <b>reflow,</b> FNR), which might be erroneously interpreted as true <b>no</b> <b>reflow</b> and might be associated with reduced capture efficiency of the basket. METHODS: We analyzed the incidence of FNR in 58 patients (60 lesions) {{at high risk of}} embolization undergoing PCI of either a SVG or a NV using the Filterwire (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA). Qualitative and quantitative angiographic analysis was performed, and the volume of collected debris was estimated using a photographic technique. RESULTS: In our population, about 1 / 3 of the cases showed FNR, which was associated with angiographically visible filling defects within the basket, indicating macroembolism. However some patients (especially those undergoing vein graft interventions) showed filling defects without FNR, and some others FNR without filling defects. Thus we tried to understand the predictors of FNR: FNR was associated with higher amount of collected debris (36. 97 +/- 42. 98 mm(3) vs. 11. 31 +/- 18. 47 mm(3), p = 0. 005), was neither prevented by abciximab, nor predicted by high thrombotic burden, increasing stent volume or need for predilatation. When patient with and without angiographically evident macroembolisation were separately analyzed, a linear correlation of FNR with the quantity of debris was only apparent in the macroembolization group. CONCLUSIONS: Interventionalists {{should be aware of the}} "Filter No Reflow", a common but reversible angiographic complication when the Filterwire device is used. Reduced flow seen during these procedures should be treated conservatively. Mechanical obstruction of the filter, but also other mechanisms (pharmacologically active debris? platelet aggregates?) play a role in this phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this {{retrospective}} study was to compare the results of transluminal extraction coronary atherectomy in saphenous vein graft lesions with and without angiographic thrombus. Background. Percutaneous interventions in lesions with thrombus are associated with reduced procedural success and increased risk of complications. Use of the transluminal extraction catheter, which cuts and aspirates atheroma and thrombus, has been advocated as a potential revascularization strategy for lesions with thrombus. Methods. Baseline patient characteristics, lesion morphology, immediate angiographic results, in-hospital complications and follow-up were prospectively entered into an interventional cardiology data base. The results of transluminal extraction coronary atherectomy in saphenous vein bypass grafts with angiographic thrombus were compared with results in similar grafts without angiographic thrombus. Results. Transluminal extraction coronary atherectomy was performed in 175 patients with 183 vein graft lesions, including 59 lesions (32 %) with thrombus (Group 1) and 124 (68 %) without thrombus (Group 2). Compared with lesions in Group 2, lesions in Group 1 were associated with {{a higher incidence of}} baseline total occlusion, diffuse disease and abnormal Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade flow (p < 0. 05); more severe diameter stenosis at baseline, after atherectomy and after final angiography (p < 0. 05); a lower rate of clinical success (69 % vs, 88 %, p < 0. 01); and more angiographic and clinical complications, including <b>no</b> <b>reflow</b> (p < 0. 05), vascular repair (p < 0. 05) and Q wave myocardial infarction (p = 0. 09). Conclusions. In transluminal extraction coronary atherectomy of saphenous vein bypass grafts, the presence of thrombus is associated with more baseline lesion complexity, reduced clinical success and increased risk of <b>no</b> <b>reflow,</b> Q wave myocardial infarction and vascular repair...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the effects of blood-free reperfusion with oxygenated or unoxygenated intracoronary perfluorochemical (Fluosol-DA 20 %) on myocardial perfusion and to determine its mechanism or mechanisms of limiting <b>no</b> <b>reflow.</b> Twenty-four dogs underwent 90 min of coronary occlusion followed by 210 min of reperfusion and were randomized to either: 1) blood-free reperfusion with intracoronary oxygenated perfluorochemical (20 ml/kg per min) for 20 min followed by blood reperfusion (n = 8); 2) intracoronary unoxygenated perfluorochemical administered as in those treated with oxygenated perfluorochemical (n = 8); and 3) blood reperfusion alone (control) (n = 8). Regional myocardial blood flow was serially determined and global myocardial perfusion was assessed by an intravenous injection of the fluorescent dye (thioflavin-S). Quantitative studies were performed to determine neutrophil infiltration and extent of endothelial injury. Hemodynamic variables were similar in all groups. The zone of impaired perfusion (thioflavin negative), expressed as a percent of the left ventricle, averaged 10 ± 2 %, 6 ± 2 % and 3 ± 1 %, in control and unoxygenated and oxygenated perfluorochemical groups, respectively (control versus oxygenated perfluorochemical p < 0. 004). The reduction in thioflavin-negative area with oxygenated perfluorochemical was associated with a notable recovery of endocardial blood flow (0. 97 ± 0. 22 vs. control 0. 39 ± 0. 08 ml/min per g; p < 0. 04) at 210 min of reperfusion. The number of capillaries plugged by neutrophils (per 200 capillaries) in thioflavin-negative areas was similar with both oxygenated (5. 9 ± 1. 4) and unoxygenated perfluorochemical (5. 4 ± 0. 8) treatment and was significantly less than that with the control group (18. 9 ± 3. 2, p < 0. 003). Myocardium reperfused with oxygenated perfluorochemical demonstrated significantly greater preservation of endothelial structure. These findings suggest that blood-free reperfusion with oxygenated perfluorochemical reduces the area of <b>no</b> <b>reflow</b> through better endothelial cell preservation...|$|E

40|$|The early {{outcomes}} after coronary intervention haveimproved remarkably, {{particularly in}} the stent era.

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} test the {{hypothesis}} that thrombus removal, with a new manual thrombus-aspirating device, before primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) may improve myocardial reperfusion compared with standard PPCI in patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI). BackgroundIn STEMI patients, PPCI may cause thrombus dislodgment and impaired microcirculatory reperfusion. Controversial results have been reported with different systems of distal protection or thrombus removal. MethodsOne-hundred forty-eight consecutive STEMI patients, admitted within 12 h of symptom onset and scheduled for PPCI, were randomly assigned to PPCI (group 1) or manual thrombus aspiration before standard PPCI (group 2). Patients with cardiogenic shock, previous infarction, or thrombolytic therapy were excluded. Primary end points were complete (> 70 %) ST-segment resolution (STR) and myocardial blush grade (MBG) 3. ResultsBaseline clinical and angiographic characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. Comparing groups 1 and 2 : complete STR 50 % versus 68 % (p < 0. 05); MBG- 3 44 % versus 88 % (p < 0. 0001); coronary Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade 3 78 % versus 89 % (p = NS); corrected TIMI frame count 21. 5 ± 12 versus 17. 3 ± 6 (p < 0. 01); <b>no</b> <b>reflow</b> 15 % versus 3 % (p < 0. 05); angiographic embolization 19 % versus 5 % (p < 0. 05); direct stenting 24 % versus 70 % (p < 0. 0001); and peak creatine kinase-mass band fraction 910 ± 128 μg/l versus 790 ± 132 μg/l (p < 0001). In-hospital clinical events were similar in the 2 groups. After adjusting for confounding factors, multivariate analysis showed thrombus aspiration to be an independent predictor of complete STR and MBG- 3. ConclusionsManual thrombus aspiration before PPCI leads to better myocardial reperfusion and is associated with lower creatine kinase mass band fraction release, lower risk of distal embolization, and <b>no</b> <b>reflow</b> compared with standard PPCI.

40|$|BACKGROUND ADAMTS 13 is a {{metalloprotease}} that cleaves von Willebrand factor (VWF), {{thereby reducing}} its prothrombotic properties. There is considerable evidence that VWF levels increase and ADAMTS 13 levels decrease in STEMI patients. It is unclear if this contributes to <b>no</b> <b>reflow,</b> infarct size and intramyocardial hemorrhage (IMH). The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the role of ADAMTS 13 in patients with acute myocardial infarction; and to investigate the benefits of recombinant (r) ADAMTS 13 in a porcine model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion with dual antiplatelet therapy and heparin. METHODS In 49 consecutive PCI-treated STEMI patients, blood samples were collected directly after and up to 7 days following PCI. Cardiac magnetic resonance was performed 4 - 6 days after PCI to determine infarct size and IMH. In 23 Yorkshire swine, the circumflex coronary artery was occluded for 75 minutes by a balloon catheter. rADAMTS 13 or vehicle was administered intracoronary following reperfusion. Myocardial injury and infarct characteristics were assessed using cardiac enzymes, ECG, and histopathology. RESULTS In patients with IMH, VWF activity and VWF antigen were significantly elevated directly after PCI and for all subsequent measurements, and ADAMTS 13 activity significantly decreased at 4 and 7 days following PCI; in comparison to patients without IMH. VWF activity and ADAMTS 13 activity were not related to infarct size. For rADAMTS 13 treated animals no differences in myocardial infarct size, IMH, or formation of microthrombi were witnessed in comparison to controls. CONCLUSIONS No correlation was witnessed between VWF/ ADAMTS 13 and infarct size in patients; and intracoronary administration of rADAMTS 13 did not decrease infarct size or IMH in a porcine model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion. These data dispute the imbalance in ADAMTS 13 and VWF as the cause of <b>no</b> <b>reflow.</b> Restoring the imbalance between ADAMTS 13 and VWF most likely will not be beneficial in STEMI patients already treated with standard antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy.

40|$|ABSTRACTPatients with {{previous}} CABG may require repeat revascularization procedures due to progression of atherosclerotic {{disease in the}} native coronary arteries and/or the bypass grafts. Repeat grafting is complicated by increased morbidity and mortality and has a worse clinical outcome than a first bypass operation. Thus, increasing numbers of publications recommend percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) for graft vessels. In parallel, it is also reported that distal embolization, coronary slow flow, or no-reflow phenomena rates are high in intervened vessels. Death, myocardial infarction (MI), and need for second revascularization are also reported to occur frequently. There is not an agreement on a certain treatment for reflow phenomenon occurring in grafts. In this case, we discussed the treatment of acute thrombosis <b>no</b> <b>reflow</b> occurring during graft vascularization {{in the light of}} a case which developed acute stent thrombosis after primary percutaneous intervention to saphenous vein graft which disappeared after tirofiban infusion...|$|E
