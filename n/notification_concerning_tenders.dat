30|$|We {{introduce}} a new node in the LTE-A network {{referred to as the}} cognitive resource manager (CRM), which coordinates the OSA to the unlicensed spectrum based on the notifications reporting the channel status perceived by the cognitive UEs. Based on the above, the CRM must include a MIHF entity which manages the event notification subscription and also receives and processes all <b>notifications</b> <b>concerning</b> spectrum sensing in order to build the Geo-DB. Since the CRM does not perform any sensing task and only compiles MIH event notifications from remote entities, it is necessary to implement a remote MIHF in every LTE-A UE. With the aim of keeping the Geo-DB updated, the CRM needs to know when a cognitive user measures that the RSSI in the licensed band crosses a specific power level or threshold. Therefore, after the attachment procedure, the CRM must send to the active user a MIH_Event_Subscribe message with the list of RBs to be monitored. Moreover, with the MIH_Link_Configure_Thresholds primitive the CRM specifies the thresholds associated with this list.|$|R

40|$|In the United States, the Clean Water Act gives EPA {{a mandate}} to set ambient water quality {{standards}} for all contaminants in surface water and to monitor toxic chemicals. However, EPA has "received health-related data on only 15 % of the 20, 000 new chemicals released in the last 30 years " (StarTribune). In addition, no federal laws have been enacted to directly control groundwater quality. Consequently, with the growth in new chemicals {{it has become increasingly}} important to measure the welfare costs of toxic water contamination. Estimating the costs of toxic chemical contamination in water bodies has received relatively little attention. What makes the valuation complicated is that empirically estimated welfare costs are likely to be “situation-dependent”. That is, the estimated value and composition of welfare costs of toxic pollution may be affected by the composition of water demand and information given to the public, and as a result, the actions of private and public agents. Raucher and others found that private averting behavior depends on the extent of public <b>notification</b> <b>concerning</b> the contaminant's health risks, whether an alternative water supply is available, and whether children are in the household.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{how different}} institutional structures shape {{the research and}} development (R&D) of genetically modified crops (GM-crops). Whether this R&D is conducted within companies, cooperatives or public research organizations (both publicly and privately funded R&D) is expected to influence the type of crops and traits that are developed and therefore the effects on society and ecosystems that potentially could follow from the use of GM-crops. This issue is analyzed empirically by statistical analysis of 1323 notifications for field trials with GM-crops that have been submitted under two EU Directives in seven European countries. The results show that the type of R&D organization influences the traits and crops that are developed. Companies are more likely to submit <b>notifications</b> that <b>concern</b> GM-crops that secure the potential for profit than are other types of R&D organizations, while R&D organizations that are purely publicly funded are more likely to submit <b>notifications</b> that only <b>concern</b> biosafety research than are cooperatives and companies.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{directions}} of activities conducted by the Agricultural Property Agency is to support agricultural farms. The most significant manifestation of such activities, aimed at supporting this objective, is the sale of land from the Agricultural Property Stock of the State Treasury to individual farmers who wish to enlarge their family farms, under a restricted tender procedure. Although the Act on the Management of the Agricultural Property Stock of the State Treasury also provides for other categories of entities – i. e. other potential participants of such restricted tenders, the procedures aimed at individual farmers are of the greatest importance in the Agency’s activities in this field. However, {{it should be noted}} that the statutory regulation <b>concerning</b> <b>tenders</b> for the sale of land with a view to supporting family farms is not complete and does not provide for any legal instruments designed not only to ensure that the land will be acquired by persons with adequate qualifications, but also that such land will be used by the purchaser for the conduct of agricultural activity. Therefore, the Agency introduces appropriate clauses into agreements with such purchasers in order to ensure that agricultural activity is conducted on the land acquired by them. However, the acceptability of such clauses may raise reasonable doubts. Uniwersytet w Białymstok...|$|R
40|$|It {{is common}} {{knowledge}} that liberalizing international exchanges does not eliminate the risks involved in international trade. For indeed, parties to an international commercial transaction are often far distant from one another and naturally know little about their respective financial or industrial situations {{as well as the}} laws and customs in force in these countries. It is these circumstances that brought about various advance payment schemes such as the letters of credit. Yet world expansion of commerce that is largely due to hydro-electric projects and other projects linked together on a worldwide basis has given rise to contract guarantees. In this article the author deals with guarantees which mainly <b>concern</b> <b>tender</b> bond, performance bond, instalment reimbursement bond. By means of these guarantees, an importer may demand that a third party whose solvency is recognized will guarantee the economic bond of the exporter. The demand for supplying a contract guarantee may also be required by the international body that finances an economic project or by way of legislation in some countries. After having described the machinery of these guarantees, the author examines the legal nature and validity of them. He then analyses the legal relationship of parties to this institution. He concludes by considering different cases that may prevent the realisation of the guarantee...|$|R

Despite identification of distinct Leishmania species isolated from cutaneous lesions, there are still no records of visceral leishmaniasis in the state. However, studies on the sand fly fauna in this region are still limited. Findings: Insects were collected from April 2011 to April 2012, using HP light traps distributed in four residential areas and one recreational area in Rio Branco, Capital of the State of Acre in the Amazon region of Brazil. A total of 456 sand flies were collected, comprising 256 females and 200 males. Taxonomic identification revealed 16 Phlebotominae genera and 23 species, as follows: Trichophoromyia auraensis, Nyssomyia whitmani, Nyssomyia antunesi, Pressatia choti, Evandromyia saulensis, Evandromyia walkeri, Evandromyia begonae, Migonemyia migonei, Pintomyia serrana, Psychodopygus paraensis, Sciopemyia sordelii, Migonemyia pusilla, Pintomyia nevesi, Brumptomyia avellari, Micropygomyia acanthopharynx, Micropygomyia micropyga, Pintomyia odax, Lutzomyia sherlocki, Pressatia calcarata, Pressatia duncanae, Bichromomyia flaviscutellata, Evandromyia bourrouli and Evandromyia bacula. From this group, Tr. auraensis and Ny. whitmani were the most abundant species in both forested areas and the peridomiciliary environment. Conclusions: We find that the sand fly fauna in the urban and peri urban areas of Rio Branco is very diverse comprising 23 species, as diverse as that in areas of primary forest. Some species, such as Nyssomyia whitmani, Ny. antunesi and Bichromomyia flaviscutellata are known vectors of parasites responsible for cutaneous leishmaniasis, and Trichophoromyia auraensis is a putative vector in this Amazonian region...|$|R
40|$|Background A {{voluntary}} surveillance {{scheme of}} occupational skin diseases (OSDs) in The Netherlands starting in 2001 aimed to improve insight {{in the incidence}} of OSD especially occupational contact dermatitis (OCD), risk professions and causal agents. This paper presents the results of this scheme during 2001 - 05. Methods Reports of new cases of OSD received from the participating dermatologists on a monthly basis were analysed. Data evaluated included information on diagnosis, sex, age, sickness, absenteeism, profession and causal agents. Relative differences in incidence rates between industries or branches were estimated by calculating incidence rate ratios. Results About 80 % of the <b>notifications</b> <b>concerned</b> OCD. The highest number of notifications was recorded {{in the first year of}} the scheme. This was probably due to reporting of a mixture of incident and prevalent cases. During the following 5 years, the number of yearly notifications of OSD declined. Hairdressers, nurses, metalworkers, mechanics and cleaners were the most commonly affected professions. Wet work and irritating substances were the most frequently reported causal agents. Most patients with OCD were not absent from work. Conclusions A voluntary surveillance scheme with dermatologists provides valuable data about the distribution of OCD in risk professions and the causal agents. However, it has certain limitations in assessing trends in incidence. Active medical surveillance in populations at risk should be encouraged not only to improve secondary prevention but also to obtain more reliable information about the incidence of OC...|$|R

This commerce connection expansion politic succeed in realizing the goal to put Makassar as the only trading central in this area.

Makassar appears as main port in trading connection with production region and making connection with other trading ports located in east, south, west and north parts.

40|$|When the {{municipal}} {{child welfare services}} in Norway receive <b>notifications</b> of <b>concern</b> regarding a child {{they are responsible for}} reviewing the general situation and assistance requirements of the relevant child and determining whether the case should be dismissed or not. In this dissertation we will consider a study carried out by three municipal child welfare institutions on <b>notifications</b> of <b>concern</b> and requests for assistance that involve nine families with altogether 19 children aged between 2 and 12. I will focus on discursive forms of practice and perspectives of children that relate to the studies carried out by the child welfare authorities and also have {{a closer look at the}} consequences these may have for the relevant children. I have collected data on the <b>notifications</b> of <b>concern</b> and requests for assistance which formed the basis of the study of 9 cases by the child welfare authorities, including the child welfare workers’ analytical procedures, the questions and thematic focus of the study, who had been invited to contribute information, their narratives of the child’s situation and assistance requirements and the child welfare workers’ own conclusions and decisions in these cases. I have also carried out interviews with child welfare workers, parents and children who have been involved in the above mentioned inquiry. The analysis of the empirical material has been inspired by Michel Foucault and Norman Fairclough. They are both concerned with the role of language and discourse in the development of practises. With the help of a micro-analytical focus I have attempted to make some interpretations with regard to the tendencies and practises I have discussed in the analysis. The <b>notifications</b> of <b>concern,</b> on which the study of the child welfare authorities were based, centred on children’s behaviour/manners, delays in children’s evolution, violence between parents in the presence of children, the mental health of parents, suspicions of sexual abuse and allegations about gross neglect. Parents who themselves have been in touch with the child welfare authorities and requested assistance emphasized the challenges of their daily workload and asked for relief. The three municipal child welfare institutions in part relied on different approaches (different research models and research categories) in order to examine the children’s situation and requirements, regardless of the uniqueness of each case. Most of the informants used by the child welfare authorities were adult persons (parents and various representatives from the professions). In two out of nine cases, children got the opportunity to provide the premises for the decisions reached in the cases. The attitude of the child welfare workers and their inclination to involve children in the research process differed from study to study. However, there was a general tendency to exclude the perspectives and narratives of the children, who were not treated as meaningful subjects in the process of inquiry. There was hardly any emphasis on their rights (the right to information and the right to express opinions). Other discourses were given priority over the discourse of rights. In the process of inquiry, the child welfare workers primarily sought to obtain individual descriptions of children and parents, narratives about the childhood of parents and accounts of interplay within the family. This indicates that child welfare workers rely on psychological knowledge. They also tended to study family networks and to some extent searched for information regarding the everyday life and its structure within the families. There was little focus on living conditions or how the family members handled various challenges in their daily lives. For the most part, deviant children (the children were described in terms of delayed development, lack of social skills, lack of empathy, ADHD, and similar things) and parents who failed in their parenting duties or parents who had requested assistance were highlighted in the narratives by the various professionals and in the conclusions drawn by the child welfare authorities. The conclusions made by child welfare authorities were marked by a lack of specific and contextual information. In eight of the cases it was decided to offer the parents advice and guidance, whereas relief measures were recommended in two of the cases. One of the cases was dismissed. A decision to offer concrete assistance to the children was not reached in any of the cases, in spite of specific measures to assist the children having been mentioned in a number of the cases. The children are constituted as something different than the adults. This difference is not only linguistically generated through the way we talk about them, but also through the fact that child welfare workers largely ignore them in the process of inquiry. This reflects the hegemony of knowledge that prevails within the current child welfare services, how knowledge becomes productive with regard to the positioning of children and parents. Both the <b>notifications</b> of <b>concern</b> and the studies of the child welfare authorities demonstrate that the language we use is not neutral. The use of language (academic terms) and the thematic focus evident in the <b>notifications</b> of <b>concern</b> and studies were closely related to the specific task and institutional connections of the various participants. In relation to the inquiries and decisions carried out by the child welfare authorities, several discourses together form a certain order of discourse. I have attempted to show that the research practise of the child welfare authorities is not only marked by legal and economic power structures, but also that the power of knowledge strongly affects how the child welfare services are ru...|$|R

The nature, the severity {{and scope of}} their adverse activity are varied and in general, even in small amount they have potent carcinogenic, genotoxic effect and injure the immune system. In order to provide high level of health protection for consumers, the European Union has established strict regulatory limits, whose implementation is enforced. The EC (2001) Commission Regulation sets maximum levels for some mycotoxins in foodstuffs: for aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, patulin, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, fumonisins, T- 2 and HT- 2 toxins. Particular product categories are regulated under specific decisions ordaining control of imported consignments {{at the point of}} entry. Due to the fact that only aflatoxins are addressed in the specific decisions, they are the mostly detected and notified mycotoxins in the EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF). The second most frequent group, Ochratoxin A is typically detected during internal EU market controls. Most RASFF <b>notifications</b> <b>concern</b> product categories falling under specific EU decisions, especially the Aflatoxin content of nuts and nut products.
