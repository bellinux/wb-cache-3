30|$|At {{the first}} cycle, 2, 890 mAh/g of charge {{capacity}} and 2, 200 mAh/g of discharge capacity {{were obtained from}} the <b>continuous</b> <b>electrode</b> (Figure 4 a), and 3, 620 mAh/g and 2, 200 mAh/g capacities {{were obtained from the}} patterned electrode (Figure 4 b). The relatively high charge capacity of the patterned electrode is mainly related to an electrochemical reaction between Li and Cu oxide layers partially exposed on the surface. It had been already reported that the reaction occurred at a voltage range of 1.7 V to 1.0 V and then formed LixCuO [13]. In addition to this, another reason is the solid electrolyte interphase formation that is sensitive to the surface morphology of the electrode because the patterned electrode has a wider surface area than the <b>continuous</b> <b>electrode</b> [6]. These reaction products lead to the capacity loss at the first cycle, and thus a low coulombic efficiency ((discharge capacity/charge capacity) × 100 (%)) of 60 % was obtained at the first cycle as shown in Figure 4 b. However, the patterned electrode exhibits higher efficiencies than those of the <b>continuous</b> <b>electrode</b> which were obtained after the first cycle.|$|R

That is, those defined through the {{expressions}} I(x, y) = S(N(x), T (x, y)) and I(x, y) = S(T (N(x), N(y)), y) respectively, where T is a t-norm, S is a t-conorm and N is a strong negation. Special attention {{is due to the}} relation between both kinds of implications. In the continuous case, the study of these implications is focused in some of their properties (mainly the contrapositive symmetry and the exchange principle). Finally, the case of <b>non</b> <b>continuous</b> t-norms or <b>non</b> <b>continuous</b> t-conorms is studied, deriving new implications of both kinds and showing that they remain strongly connected...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE - To {{determine}} if {{the application of a}} <b>continuous</b> <b>electrode</b> paste band on precordial leads results in alteration of the electrocardiographic tracing as compared with an adequate amount of electrode paste, and if the former condition does not cause uniform morphologies from V 1 to V 6. METHODS - The amplitude and morphology of the electrocardiographic waves on the precordial leads in electrocardiographic tracings, which were performed with standard (control group) or excessive (continuous band) application of the electrode paste, were compared. RESULTS - None of the 106 patients studied showed uniformity of the QRS morphology from V 1 to V 6. The eletrocardiographic alterations identified in the tracings performed with a <b>continuous</b> <b>electrode</b> paste band that showed statistical significance in relation to the control group were the following: inversion of the P wave in V 1; inversion of the T wave in V 1, V 2, and V 3; appearance of R' waves in V 1 and V 2; disappearance of S waves in V 1; appearance of S waves in V 5 and V 6; alterations in the amplitude of almost all waves, in all leads. CONCLUSION - Application of a <b>continuous</b> <b>electrode</b> paste band in the precordial leads may cause significant alterations in the electrocardiographic tracing obtained...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A new connectionist {{model for}} the {{solution}} of piecewise linear regression problems is introduced; {{it is able to}} reconstruct both <b>continuous</b> and <b>non</b> <b>continuous</b> real valued mappings starting from a finite set of possibly noisy samples. The approximating function can assume a different linear behavior in each region of an unknown polyhedral partition of the input domain. The proposed learning technique combines local estimation, clustering in weight space, multicategory classification and linear regression in order to achieve the desired result. Through this approach piecewise affine solutions for general nonlinear regression problems can also be found. ...|$|R
