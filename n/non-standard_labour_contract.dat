A methodological contribution is that we use propensity score matching, which allows us to draw causal inferences about the relationship between having a <b>labour</b> <b>contract</b> and each of these variables. We find that the effect of having a <b>labour</b> <b>contract</b> on employee outcomes is generally large and larger than the findings in other studies suggest. As such, our results suggest that China 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Labour</b> <b>Contract</b> Law, which has made signing <b>labour</b> <b>contracts</b> mandatory, has been effective in improving the outcomes for Chinese workers...|$|R
40|$|In agriculture, the {{coexistence}} of {{different forms of}} land tenancy or <b>labour</b> <b>contract</b> has been explained so far by several theories related to Marshallian inefficiency, incentives, risk sharing, and transaction costs, including supervision costs. These theories and the empirical evidences have greatly contributed to explain the reasons behind land tenancy or <b>labour</b> <b>contract</b> choice. This study follows up on this. Moreover, it intends to take a further step by focusing particularly on the production technologies at plot level, and by designing and testing a theoretical model based on household profit optimization. This model will {{take into account the}} supervision costs of labour (i) to compare optimum profit derived from plots based on household labour, a sharecropping <b>labour</b> <b>contract,</b> and a wage <b>labour</b> <b>contract,</b> controlling for irrigation equipment (ii) to test the efficiency of the <b>labour</b> <b>contract</b> choice using data from Senegal’s horticultural zone. As expected, the production elasticity of labour decreases when improved irrigation equipment like a motor pump is used. The technology displays an increasing return to scale on plots without a motor pump and a constant return to scale on plots irrigated with a motor pump. While on plots without a motor pump the sharecropping contract is the efficient <b>labour</b> <b>contract</b> choice, leading to a higher optimum profit for the household, on plots irrigated with a motor pump, the wage contract is the best <b>labour</b> <b>contract</b> choice. Consequently, we can conclude from this finding that the use of a motor pump drives out the sharecropping contract in favour of household labour and the wage <b>labour</b> <b>contract.</b> land tenancy, <b>labour,</b> sharecropping, wage, <b>contract,</b> supervision, household, profit optimization, efficient, irrigation equipment, horticulture, Senegal, Agricultural Finance,...|$|R

40|$|Not only {{is there}} an {{increase}} in the use of contract workers in some of today’s workplaces, but a qualitative shift has also taken place in the nature of <b>labour</b> <b>contracting,</b> as the operation of labour intermediaries has expanded from peripheral services to the main production activities of companies. This new phenomenon implies the greater integration of <b>labour</b> <b>contracting</b> into the production process, together with changes in employment practices and the rights of workers. This thesis aims to better understand how the changing nature of <b>labour</b> <b>contracting</b> affects employment relationships by undertaking an empirical investigation of in-house contracting arrangements in the South Korean automobile industry. In so doing, it examines roles and relationships between workplace actors involved in labour contracting; namely, user firm management, contractors, labour organisations, user firm employees, contract workers and the state. This analysis sheds light on the process of change in <b>labour</b> <b>contracting</b> and the consequences of increased <b>labour</b> <b>contracting</b> in the workplace. The thesis argues that the coordination of workplace changes brought about by increased flexibility attained through the use of contract workers is fraught with tension, which influences the ways in which employment relationships are shaped in the context of any particular firm. The essence of such tension lies in the pursuit of organisational flexibility and quality control in the production process, both of which are considered to be necessary to ensuring the performance of firms. Contradictions arise from the attempts of user firms to avoid employment-related responsibility for the labour force, {{while at the same time}} exerting managerial control over contract workers. Such tensions and paradoxes are associated with conflicts of interest, and compromise between and within workplace actors. A case study of the Korean automobile industry is provided that explores the contradictory nature of the <b>labour</b> <b>contracting</b> system, as contract workers with fewer employment entitlements are brought into core production processes; and investigates the manner in which inherent tensions play out in shaping employment relationships and the orientation of <b>labour</b> <b>contracting</b> practices. The findings of this thesis could help in the further understanding of the implications of change in <b>labour</b> <b>contracting</b> practices, and contribute to overcoming the current limits of thinking with regard to labour flexibility and employment relationships in the context of in-house contracting...|$|R

40|$|Since 1958 the hukou (household registration) {{system has}} {{assigned}} Chinese citizens either a rural or urban status. Some studies {{argue that the}} rural-to-urban migrants in China {{who do not have}} urban hukou are not entitled to urban social insurance schemes, due to institutional discrimination, which applies differing treatment to urban and rural hukou (chengxiang fenge). Although rural-urban migrants participate less in the social insurance system than their counterparts with urban hukou, a closer examination of recent policy developments shows that migrants actually do have the legal right to access the system. This implies that discrimination between rural and urban workers has been declining, and distinctions based on household registration status are less able to explain China 2 ̆ 7 s current urban transition. This paper provides a new way of examining Chinese migrants 2 ̆ 7 social insurance participation, by adopting a framework that includes both rural-to-urban migrants and urban-to-urban migrants, which are an important, but less studied, migrant group. Among our key findings are that urban migrants are more likely to sign a <b>labour</b> <b>contract</b> than rural migrants; urban migrants have higher participation rates in social insurance than rural migrants; having a <b>labour</b> <b>contract</b> has a greater impact than hukou status in determining whether Beijing 2 ̆ 7 s floating population accesses social insurance; and urban migrants who have signed a <b>labour</b> <b>contract</b> have higher participation rates in social insurance than either rural migrants or urban migrants without a <b>labour</b> <b>contract...</b>|$|R
