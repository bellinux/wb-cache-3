5|$|In July 1793, Southey {{discussed}} {{the story of}} Joan of Arc with Grosvenor Bedford, his friend. The conversation led to him believe that Joan of Arc {{would serve as a}} good basis for an epic so he began to work a plan for the poem and started composing lines. The subject of the poem appealed to Southey because it reflected incidents surrounding the French Revolution that started in early 1793. By 8 August, he had around 300lines of the poem written. On 13 August, he devoted his time to writing a 12-book poem that he hoped to complete by the end of September. After admitting this desire for haste in the preface to the poem's first edition, critics accused Southey of <b>not</b> <b>spending</b> enough time on composing the poem. During Summer 1794, Southey attempted to find a publisher for John of Arc while taking up The Fall of Robespierre, a poetic drama about the French Revolution, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge.|$|E
5|$|By {{executive}} order, Bevin required {{all state}} agencies to reduce spending {{in their current}} budgets by 4.5 percent. House Speaker Greg Stumbo argued that Bevin {{did not have the}} authority to order such reductions without legislative approval, but Senate President Robert Stivers defended Bevin's action, saying it amounted to simply <b>not</b> <b>spending</b> money that was previously allocated. Bevin later compromised with the state's public college and university presidents to reduce the cuts to 2 percent, but Attorney General Andy Beshear sued to stop the cuts entirely. On May 18, 2016, a Franklin Circuit Court judge ruled Bevin did have the authority to make the cuts. The Kentucky Supreme Court accepted the case on appeal, granting Beshear's request to bypass the Kentucky Court of Appeals for expediency. A hearing before the Supreme Court occurred on August 18. On September 21, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a 5–2 decision reversing the Franklin Circuit Court ruling and agreeing with Beshear that Bevin did not have the authority to make mid-year budget cuts without the approval of the General Assembly.|$|E
40|$|Research by the Pensions Commission {{indicates}} that older pensioners, on average, spend substantially less {{of their income}} than young pensioners. It {{has also been shown}} that pensioners {{are more likely to be}} 'expenditure poor' than 'income poor' when compared with the general population. This potentially has significant implications for the Government's strategy for tackling pensioner poverty, depending on the reasons why pensioners do <b>not</b> <b>spend.</b> The Department for Work and Pensions commissioned the Social Policy Research Unit to examine which pensioner households do <b>not</b> <b>spend</b> their income and why that might be. Apart from the fact that older pensioners tend to spend less than younger ones, very little is known about which pensioners do <b>not</b> <b>spend</b> substantial amounts of their income. Even less is known about why they do <b>not</b> <b>spend</b> it...|$|R

25|$|An {{investor}} who has some money has two options: {{to spend it}} right now or to invest it.

25|$|In October 1960, a new model, The Frisky Prince {{was shown}} at the Earls Court Motor Show. This was {{basically}} a re-bodied Family Three with front hung doors. Around the same time, a deal was done with a company called Middlesbrough Motorcraft and kits to build your own Frisky became available from them.

25|$|Though Jackson {{opposed the}} excesses of Joe McCarthy, who had {{traveled}} to Washington State to campaign against him in 195, he also criticized Dwight Eisenhower for <b>not</b> <b>spending</b> enough on national defense. Jackson called for more inter-continental ballistic missiles in the national arsenal, and his support for nuclear weapons resulted in a primary challenge from the left in 1958, when he handily defeated Seattle peace activist Alice Franklin Bryant before winning re-election with 67 percent of the vote, which he topped the next four times he ran for re-election.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of this Supermom ideal, {{cultural}} contradictions of motherhood widely exist. Working mothers are often critiqued for being selfish and <b>not</b> <b>spending</b> enough time with their children. They defend their position by saying they work to support their children economically. Homemakers are often critiqued for not pursuing meaningful careers. They respond by saying that the childcare and other domestic work they do for their families is much more important. Only the unrealistic depiction of the supermom can balance these two ideological extremes, but that ideal is an unrealistic solution for most women.|$|E
25|$|Romney and Huntsman clashed over China, with Romney {{saying that}} America {{was in the}} middle of a trade war with China, who must be taken to the World Trade Organization over {{currency}} manipulation. Huntsman replied that China can't be taken to the WTO and starting a trade war with them would be bad for the American economy. The debate itself was criticised for <b>not</b> <b>spending</b> sufficient time on the Eurozone crisis, with only the very last question devoted to it, which only Huntsman was given the opportunity to answer.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{his return}} from abroad in 1988, Brown {{announced}} that he would stand as a candidate to become chairman of the California Democratic Party, and won against investment banker Steve Westly. Although Brown greatly expanded the party's donor base and enlarged its coffers, with a focus on grassroots organizing and get out the vote drives, he was criticized for <b>not</b> <b>spending</b> enough money on TV ads, which was felt to have contributed to Democratic losses in several close races in 1990. In early 1991, Brown abruptly resigned his post and {{announced that he would}} run for the Senate seat held by the retiring Alan Cranston. Although Brown consistently led in the polls for both the nomination and the general election, he abandoned the campaign, deciding instead to run for the presidency for the third time.|$|E
25|$|On 29 June, club {{president}} Carson Yeung {{was arrested}} in Hong Kong on charges of money laundering, relating to a period before his involvement with the club. He was bailed to re-appear in August, his assets were frozen, and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange suspended trading of shares in the club's holding company, Birmingham International Holdings (BIHL), in which Yeung was the single largest shareholder with around 26%. BIHL appointed acting chairman Peter Pannu and Yeung's 18-year-old son Ryan {{to the board of}} the football club, and Michael Wiseman stepped down from the board, ending an 83-year formal association between the club and the Wiseman family. Although it appeared that HSBC, the club's bankers, were unlikely to call in a loan secured on the St Andrew's site, as such a course of action would make it difficult for the club to continue, thus reducing the likelihood of HSBC recovering their money, Yeung's situation impeded the search for new investment. Such a combination of factors, added to the reduced income to be expected following relegation, left the club in financial difficulty and ready to off-load high-earning players, particularly in light of the Football League's adoption of UEFA's financial fair-play regulations relating to clubs <b>not</b> <b>spending</b> in excess of their revenue.|$|E

500|$|The protagonists of {{his films}} often deal with {{excessive}} drug, smoke or alcohol consumption, personal guilt, extreme rage and arrogance which leads them into self-shattering situations. Often portrays small but strong female characters. Most {{of his films}} deal with realistic scenarios and take clues from real incidents. Like the 1976-77 Joshi-Abhyankar serial murders reference in Paanch, the 1993 Mumbai bombing in Black Friday, the 1999 Delhi hit-and-run case and DPS MMS Scandal in Dev.D and the depiction of real life gang wars in Gangs of Wasseypur.

500|$|Critics also {{disagreed}} sharply regarding {{whether the}} game was a large step forward for the series. Parish said that less enemy variety was balanced by changes he considered the most experimental things Bungie had done for years. Edge and Bramwell praised {{the contrast between the}} Rookie's nighttime segments and the more fast-paced flashback vignettes. Edge added that while the narrative design was not groundbreaking, it served as a structure for exploring every possible weapon choice and strategy in the series. While Parish considered the ODST's abilities much {{different from those of the}} Chief, other critics such as Jackson wrote that the Halo feel was barely changed and that this was not detrimental. Brett Molina of USA Today felt that the game disappointed by <b>not</b> <b>spending</b> more time in the Rookie's open environment; [...] "instead," [...] Molina wrote, [...] "roughly two-thirds of ODSTs combat feels very much like a traditional Halo game" [...] instead of exploring new mechanics.|$|E
60|$|Pleasure is a bait to {{the mind}}, {{and the mind}} will attract the body: where the heart is, the object shall always have the body's company. The great {{objection}} I meet with from young tradesmen against this argument is, they follow no unlawful pleasures; they do <b>not</b> <b>spend</b> their time in taverns, and drinking to excess; they do <b>not</b> <b>spend</b> their money in gaming, and so stock-starve their business, and rob the shop to supply the extravagant losses of play; or they do <b>not</b> <b>spend</b> their hours in ill company and debaucheries; all they do, is a little innocent diversion in riding abroad now and then for the air, and for their health, and to ease their thoughts of the throng of other affairs which are heavy upon them, &c.|$|R

500|$|As {{a matter}} of policy, Curtin wanted Australian forces to be {{involved}} in liberating New Guinea. MacArthur therefore proposed that Australian troops relieve the American garrisons on New Britain, Bougainville and New Guinea. However, MacArthur balked at Blamey's proposal to replace the seven American divisions with just seven Australian brigades, resulting in the 6th Division being employed as well. The larger garrisons permitted offensive operations, and demanded them if the 6th Division was to be freed for employment elsewhere. These operations aroused considerable criticism {{on the grounds that they}} were unnecessary, that the troops should have been employed elsewhere, and that the Army's equipment and logistics were inadequate. Blamey vigorously defended his aggressive policy to reduce the bypassed Japanese garrisons and free the civilian population, but some felt that he went too far in putting his case publicly in a national radio broadcast. He was also criticised for <b>not</b> <b>spending</b> enough time in forward areas, although he spent more than half his time outside Australia in 1944, and between April 1944 and April 1945 travelled [...] by air, [...] by sea and [...] by land. Blamey urged that the 7th Division not be sent to Balikpapan, an operation that he regarded as unnecessary. On this occasion, he was not supported by the government, and the operation went ahead as planned.|$|E
500|$|Kurt sets up Burt with Finn's widowed mother Carole (Romy Rosemont) in {{the episode}} [...] "Home", hoping {{it will help}} him become closer to Finn, who he has a crush on. The {{relationship}} has become serious before Finn finds out about it, and he is initially hostile to it, but begins to bond with Burt over sports when the two families go out to dinner. It is implied that Burt's motivation to build a connection with Finn is more out of his knowledge that Finn never had a father to do things with, and not favoritism over his own son. However, Kurt feels left out, and later asks Finn to help him break up their parents. Finn initially agrees, but changes his mind after Burt tells him that he loves Carole and would never hurt her. In [...] "Laryngitis", Kurt feels increasingly jealous of how much time Burt is spending with Finn, so he attempts to emulate Burt's personality to regain Burt's attention. When Burt takes Finn to yet another event without including Kurt, a hurt and angry Kurt drops his emulation {{of his father and}} sings [...] "". Burt overhears his performance, praises Kurt's singing and apologizes for <b>not</b> <b>spending</b> enough time with him. He assures Kurt that he still loves him and always will, no matter what his son chooses to be.|$|E
