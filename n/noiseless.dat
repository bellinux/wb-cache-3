5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} applications of samarium is in samarium–cobalt magnets, which have a nominal composition of SmCo5 or Sm2Co17. They have high permanent magnetization, which is about 10,000 times that of iron and is second only to that of neodymium magnets. However, samarium-based magnets have higher resistance to demagnetization, as they are stable to temperatures above 700°C (cf. 300–400°C for neodymium magnets). These magnets are found in small motors, headphones, and high-end magnetic pickups for guitars and related musical instruments. For example, they are used in the motors of a solar-powered electric aircraft, the Solar Challenger, and in the Samarium Cobalt <b>Noiseless</b> electric guitar and bass pickups.|$|E
5|$|The flight on long pointed wings is <b>noiseless,</b> due {{to their}} soft plumage, and very buoyant. Flying birds can be sexed since the male has a white wing patch across three primary {{feathers}} and white tips to the two outer tail feathers, whereas females do not show any white in flight. Chicks have downy brown and buff plumage, and the fledged young are similar in appearance to the adult female. Adults moult their body feathers from June onwards after breeding, suspend the process while migrating, and replace the tail and flight feathers on the wintering grounds. Moult is completed between January and March. Immature birds follow a similar moult strategy to the adults unless they are from late broods, {{in which case the}} entire moult may take place in Africa.|$|E
5|$|Hauptmann Koch divided his force {{into four}} assault groups. Group Granite, under Oberleutnant Rudolf Witzig, {{composed}} of eighty-five men in eleven gliders whose task {{would be to}} assault and capture Fort Eben Emael; Group Steel, commanded by Oberleutnant Gustav Altmann, and formed of ninety-two men and nine gliders, would capture the Veldwezelt bridge; Group Concrete, commanded by Leutnant Gerhard Schacht and composed of ninety-six men in eleven gliders, would capture the Vroenhoven bridge; and Group Iron, under Leutnant Martin Schächter, composed of ninety men in ten gliders, who would capture the Kanne bridge. The crucial element for the assault force, particularly Group Granite, was time. It was believed {{that the combination of}} a <b>noiseless</b> approach by the gliders used by the assault force, and the lack of a declaration of war by the German government, would give the attackers the element of surprise. However, German estimates were that this would last, at the most, for sixty minutes, after which the superior numbers of the Belgian forces defending the fort and the bridges, as well as any reinforcements sent to the area, would begin to come to bear against the relatively small number of lightly armed airborne troops. The German plan, therefore, was to eliminate within those sixty minutes as many anti-aircraft positions and individual cupolas and casemates as was possible, and at all costs to put out of action the long-range artillery pieces which covered the three bridges. The destruction of these guns was expected to be completed within ten minutes; within this time the airborne troops would have to break out of their gliders, cover the distance to the guns, fix the explosive charges to the barrels of the guns and detonate them, all while under enemy fire.|$|E
25|$|Around 1970, Gibson {{replaced}} the P-90 on several models with a mini side-by-side humbucker {{now known as}} the mini-humbucker. This pickup was originally used on Epiphone models such as the Sheraton and with suitable mounting hardware became interchangeable with the P-90. In response to a resurgence of popularity of the P-90 Gibson issued the P-100, a stacked version (see above) of the P-90. Gibson also makes a new <b>noiseless</b> P-90 version called the H-90, which is found in Billie Joe Armstrong's Signature Les Paul Junior. The H-90 has two stacked coils and Gibson claims that it does not lose the characteristics of a P-90 although many players feel differently, perhaps contributing to its lack of use in other guitars.|$|E
25|$|James Rand Jr. soon {{took the}} company on a buying spree. The company became the largest {{supplier}} of office furniture in the world through its 1926 acquisition of Globe Wernicke Co., but was forced to divest itself of the business later that year after an antitrust action. Between 1927 and 1929, the company merged with or bought {{out a number of}} companies, including Index Visible, Inc. (which had been founded by Yale University economist Irving Fisher), Safe-Cabinet Co. (which had invented the fire-proof safe), Library Bureau, Inc. (which had invented the filing cabinet), Dalton Adding Machine and Baker-Vawter Ledger. For a brief time in 1926, the company was known as Rand Kardex Bureau, Inc. In 1927, James Rand Jr. merged his company with the Remington Typewriter Co. (which had invented the <b>noiseless</b> and electric typewriters) and changed its name to Remington Rand. Company sales grew from $5 million in 1927 to $500 million in 1954.|$|E
25|$|For signal processing, the Wiener filter is {{a filter}} {{proposed}} by Wiener during the 1940s {{and published in}} 1942 as a classified document. Its purpose {{is to reduce the}} amount of noise present in a signal by comparison with an estimation of the desired <b>noiseless</b> signal. Wiener developed the filter at the Radiation Laboratory at MIT to predict the position of German bombers from radar reflections. It is necessary to predict the future, because by the time the shell reaches the vicinity of the target, the target has moved, and maybe has changed direction slightly. They even modeled the muscle response of the pilot, which led eventually to cybernetics. The unmanned V1's were particularly easy to model, and on a good day, American guns fitted with Wiener filters would shoot down 99 out of 100 V1's as they entered Britain from the English channel, on their way to London. What emerged was a mathematical theory of great generality---a theory for predicting the future as best as one can on the basis of incomplete information about the past. It was a statistical theory that included applications that didn't strictly speaking predict the future, but only tried to remove noise. It made use of Wiener's earlier work on integral equations and Fourier transforms.|$|E

2500|$|At seventeen, Emily {{attended}} the Roe Head Girls' School, where Charlotte {{was a teacher}} but managed to stay {{only a few months}} before being overcome by extreme homesickness. Charlotte later stated that: [...] "Liberty was the breath of Emily's nostrils; without it she perished. The change from her own home to a school and from her own very <b>noiseless,</b> very secluded but unrestricted and unartificial mode of life, to one of disciplined routine (though under the kindest auspices), was what she failed in enduring... I felt in my heart she would die, if she did not go home, and with this conviction obtained her recall." [...] She returned home and Anne took her place. At this time, the girls' objective was to obtain sufficient education to open a small school of their own.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{research}} groups {{have attempted to}} combine LQG with other research programs: Johannes Aastrup, Jesper M. Grimstrup et al. research combines noncommutative geometry with canonical quantum gravity and Ashtekar variables, Laurent Freidel, Simone Speziale, et al., spinors and twistor theory with loop quantum gravity, and Lee Smolin et al. with Verlinde entropic gravity and loop gravity. Stephon Alexander, Antonino Marciano and Lee Smolin have attempted to explain the origins of weak force chirality in terms of Ashketar's variables, which describe gravity as chiral, and LQG with Yang–Mills theory fields in four dimensions. Sundance Bilson-Thompson, Hackett et al., has attempted to introduce standard model via LQG's degrees of freedom as an emergent property (by employing the idea <b>noiseless</b> subsystems a useful notion introduced in more general situation for constrained systems by Fotini Markopoulou-Kalamara et al.) ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{alternate}} {{plan was}} {{put forth by}} John Hencken, an engineer, and approved by Ernest P. Goodrich, consulting engineer to the [...] Regional Plan of New York and its Environs. A linear corridor would be built from the Battery to Yonkers. A freight railroad would lie underground. On ground level would be roads alongside the corridor and an indoor enclosed sidewalk. The mezzanine, {{between the first and}} second floors, would be occupied by office space. The second floor would carry a [...] "continuous <b>noiseless</b> moving platform system for passenger service", with adjacent belts moving at various speeds, for a maximum of 21 miles per hour (34km/h) in the middle. This service would be free, and would be a substitute for new subways in the corridor. Above the second floor would be about ten stories of apartments, offices, businesses, and other uses appropriate for the neighborhoods; these would be the main source of revenue to pay for the project. A high-speed motor parkway, open to passenger cars only, would lie on top. Cars would reach the upper level via ramps at both ends and elevators at convenient intervals.|$|E
2500|$|Flexible or {{so-called}} [...] "unbreakable" [...] records made {{of unusual}} materials were introduced {{by a number}} of manufacturers at various times during the 78rpm era. In the UK, Nicole records, made of celluloid or a similar substance coated onto a cardboard core disc, were produced for a few years beginning in 1904, but they suffered from an exceptionally high level of surface noise. In the United States, Columbia Records introduced flexible, fiber-cored [...] "Marconi Velvet Tone Record" [...] pressings in 1907, but the advantages and longevity of their relatively <b>noiseless</b> surfaces depended on the scrupulous use of special gold-plated Marconi Needles and the product was not a success. Thin, flexible plastic records such as the German Phonycord and the British Filmophone and Goodson records appeared around 1930 but also did not last long. The contemporary French Pathé Cellodiscs, made of a very thin black plastic, which uncannily resembles the vinyl [...] "sound sheet" [...] magazine inserts of the 1965–1985 era, were similarly short-lived. In the US, Hit of the Week records, made of a patented translucent plastic called Durium coated on a heavy brown paper base, were introduced in early 1930. A new issue came out every week and they were sold at newsstands like a weekly magazine. Although inexpensive and commercially successful at first, they soon fell victim to the Great Depression and production in the US ended in 1932. Related Durium records continued to be made somewhat later in the UK and elsewhere, and as remarkably late as 1950 in Italy, where the name [...] "Durium" [...] survived far into the LP era as a trademark on ordinary vinyl records. Despite all these attempts at innovation, shellac compounds continued to be used for the overwhelming majority of commercial 78rpm records during the lifetime of the format.|$|E
