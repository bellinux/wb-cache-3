5|$|Edward’s long reign had {{forged a}} new <b>national</b> <b>identity,</b> {{reinforced}} by Middle English beginning to establish {{itself as the}} spoken and written language of government.

5|$|In the 2011 Census, 62% of Scotland's {{population}} stated their <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> as 'Scottish only', 18% as 'Scottish and British', 8% as 'British only', and 4% chose 'other identity only'.|$|E
5|$|Since the 18th century, {{the farmer}} John Bull has {{represented}} English <b>national</b> <b>identity,</b> first in John Arbuthnot's political satires, and soon afterwards in cartoons by James Gillray and others including John Tenniel. He likes food, beer, dogs, horses, and country sports; he is practical {{and down to}} earth, and anti-intellectual.|$|E

5|$|After the {{reconversion}} of Scandinavian Scotland in {{the tenth}} century, Christianity under papal authority was the dominant {{religion of the}} kingdom. The process of Christianisation was also significant {{in the development of}} Scottish <b>national</b> <b>identity,</b> the Hiberno-Scottish mission to Continental Europe, the development of Insular art, and the introduction of Latin and formal education.|$|E
5|$|An {{ethnically diverse}} region, Abkhazia was {{nominally}} {{led by the}} titular Abkhaz people, who made up less than 30% of the population; other major groups included Georgians, Armenians, Greeks, and Russians. Even though they did not form the majority, the Abkhaz were heavily favoured, and the Abkhaz language was promoted, {{a result of the}} korenizatsiia policies of the era. An Abkhaz <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> was promoted through these policies, instilling a sense of Abkhaz nationalism.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the period}} Scotland had adopted many of the major tenets of the European Renaissance in art, {{architecture}} and literature and produced a developed educational system. This period has been seen one in which a clear <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> emerged in Scotland, as well as significant distinctions between different regions of the country which would be particularly significant in the period of the Reformation.|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to explore how second-generation young adults with foreign {{background}} understand their ethnic identities and how they relate to their <b>national</b> <b>identities.</b> Semi-structured interviews with 7 second-generation young adults with foreign background were conducted. The basis for our analysis was social identity theory, identity theory and previous research. As the result shows, the participants in this study had developed an understanding of their ethnic identities in relation to their <b>national</b> <b>identities</b> based on influential factors. The influential factors that elicited these understandings of their ethnic identities in relation to their <b>national</b> <b>identities</b> were: influential people and cultural influences. On the basis of these influential factors, it had become easier for some participants to identify themselves more with their ethnic identities. However, for other participants, the understanding of their ethnic identities did not influence their feelings of belongingness to the host society, which means they have considered themselves to belong to both their ethnic and <b>national</b> <b>identities.</b> For those participants who could not identify themselves with both their ethnic identities and relate to their <b>national</b> <b>identities</b> chose to identify themselves with something else, which in this case religion. ...|$|R

5|$|For most of {{the last}} century {{military}} service {{has been one of the}} single greatest shared experiences of white Australian males, and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars during the second half of the 20th century, it continues to influence Australian society to this day. War and military service have been defining influences in Australian history, while a major part of the <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> has been built on an idealised conception of the Australian experience of war and of soldiering, known as the Anzac spirit. These ideals include notions of endurance, courage, ingenuity, humour, larrikinism, egalitarianism and mateship; traits which, according to popular thought, defined the behaviour of Australian soldiers fighting at Gallipoli during the First World War. The Gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw Australians taking part as Australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of <b>national</b> <b>identity.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Polish, Czech and German national orientations there was another group living in the area, the Ślązakowcy, who claimed a distinct Silesian <b>national</b> <b>identity.</b> This group enjoyed popular support throughout the whole of Cieszyn Silesia although its strongest supporters were among the Protestants in {{eastern part of the}} Cieszyn Silesia (now part of Poland) and not in Zaolzie itself.|$|E

5|$|Producers in the Indies {{would often}} handle {{multiple}} roles, such as director and cinematographer. When these positions were filled separately, the producer retained creative control. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that works produced {{during this time}} were emphatically commercial, {{not paying attention to}} nationalistic or aesthetic values. However, the film scholars Thomas Barker and Charlotte Setijadi-Dunn suggest that the Chinese-produced films from the Indies offered the possibility of a heterogeneous <b>national</b> <b>identity.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Language Movement catalysed the {{assertion}} of Bengali <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> in East Bengal and later East Pakistan, and became a forerunner to Bengali nationalist movements, including the 6-Point Movement and subsequently the Bangladesh Liberation War and Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. In Bangladesh, 21 February is observed as Language Movement Day, a national holiday. The Shaheed Minar monument was constructed near Dhaka Medical College {{in memory of the}} movement and its victims.|$|E
5|$|The life of Queen Catherine {{has been}} one of the most popular themes in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina, {{attracting}} the attention of scholars from the neighbouring countries of Croatia and Serbia as well. With the rise of ethnic nationalism, historians attempted to ascribe to her a particular <b>national</b> <b>identity</b> – Croat, Serb or Bosniak, which is completely anachronistic to medieval times.|$|E

5|$|The {{registration}} for, and issuing of, <b>National</b> <b>identity</b> cards, {{a legally}} required document for accessing various services, to these remote tribes has been problematic for many years, {{and in the}} past had even resulted in {{a large number of people}} from the Penan ethnic group being rendered effectively stateless. In recent years, this issue has seen progressive improvement with the implementation of systems such as mobile registration units.|$|E
5|$|Up to {{the mid-19th}} century {{members of the local}} Slav {{population}} did not identify themselves as members of larger ethnolinguistic entities. In Cieszyn Silesia (as in all West Slavic borderlands) various territorial identities pre-dated ethnic and <b>national</b> <b>identity.</b> Consciousness of membership within a greater Polish or Czech nation spread slowly in Silesia.|$|E
5|$|Ann Eliza Bleecker's {{pastoral}} poems exemplified a {{new style}} of American poetry, and, due to her experience of the American Revolutionary tumult, {{a new sense of}} <b>national</b> <b>identity.</b> These poems, written in the pastoral tradition, conveyed both the beauty of the colonial New York countryside and the horrific impact of war, suffering, death, and destruction. Because Bleecker was writing from the interesting perspective of a terrified young mother, her articulate depictions of the Revolutionary War are still read by historians today.|$|E
