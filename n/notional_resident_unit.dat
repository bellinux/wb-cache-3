40|$|I. Current {{international}} {{standards for the}} statistical treatment of the issue In many cases, a business will set up a separate legal entity in order to undertake operations in an economy outside its home economy. However, where a separate entity is not created in the outside economy, but the operations are substantial, a <b>notional</b> institutional <b>unit</b> <b>resident</b> in that economy may be identified for statistical purposes. In this paper, such a unit is called a “branch. ” 1 Although a branch is not a legal entity, it behaves in many ways as if it were, and treating it as a unit can allow statistics to give a better portrayal of the economic reality, see 1993 SNA paras. 4. 49 - 52. (An issues paper for DITEG deals with the valuation of branches, so this paper is only concerned with the units and residence issues.) The BPM 5 criteria for identifying the operations of an unincorporated branch as a separate institutional unit are that the branch: • engage in significant production of goods and services; • plan to operate the business indefinitely or {{a long period of}} time; • have a substantial physical presence; • maintain a complete and separate set of accounts of local activities (i. e., incom...|$|R

5000|$|GNI {{is defined}} in {{accordance}} with the European system of national and regional accounts. GNI represents total primary income receivable by resident institutional units: compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, property income (interest, dividends and reinvested earnings from foreign direct investment receivable less payable), gross operating surplus and gross mixed income. It corresponds to the better known gross domestic product (GDP) minus primary income payable by <b>resident</b> <b>units</b> to non-resident units, plus primary income receivable by <b>resident</b> <b>units</b> {{from the rest of the}} world. Technically speaking, the GNI is a balancing item of the allocation of primary income account in the sequence of accounts for the total economy. Loosely speaking, it is the sum of domestic and foreign income earned by the resident population of a country. It is worth noting that GNI is income from productive activities excluding any capital gains and losses (also known as [...] "holding gains and losses") resulting from price changes of fixed or financial assets (for example: price changes on the stock market have no direct impact on GNI).|$|R

40|$|The new {{residential}} property price in Hong Kong has rocketed {{in the last}} decade and has ranked within the top three metropolitan cities in the world. Housing is a necessity for most people, high {{residential property}} price has its social ramification. The rocketing price seems not solely the result of the market. As such, this raised the issue of competition in this market. This study employs Concentration Ratio and Hirfindahl-Hirschman index to evaluate the market concentration of the New Private <b>Resident</b> <b>Units</b> Market in Hong Kong. Using the best information available in the public domains and applying universal thresholds, the New Private <b>Resident</b> <b>Units</b> Market in Hong Kong is considered moderately concentrated. It is noted that the big five listed developers in Hong Kong are collectively holding a dominant position of the potential supply. Moreover, the top three have comparable market shares thus suggesting no monopoly exists. It is also found that the substantial land banks held by the five big listed developers, amount to 60 % of that owned by the Government. These developers will therefore retain their dominant market power in the future. Further study is recommended to examine whether the big developers have abused their market power...|$|R
40|$|Residence in a {{currency}} union and residence {{in a single}} economy 1. Being a resident of a country member of {{a currency}} union necessarily implies being a resident of this currency union. The question is asked {{as to whether the}} reverse is true, i. e. does being a <b>resident</b> <b>unit</b> of a currency union imply being a <b>resident</b> <b>unit</b> of at least one member country of the union? In other words, can the existence of a currency union create a residence status additional to the residence status of the component economies of the currency union? 2. In the first place, this paper discusses the issue of the residence status of a currency union central bank (CUCB) in a currency union. This paper also discusses the case of multiterritory enterprise, 1 for which the centre of economic interest is not clearly established and, in some cases, more closely related to the union as a whole than to any individual country.

The conventional data source of IMTS has been Customs documents, thus the basic recording principle the cross-border physical movement of goods.

However, with the evolution of globalization, official ITGS statistics is facing challenges regarding its key conceptual and data collection aspects: Customs formalities are simplified and even abolished {{in the frame of}} a Customs union, non-resident units are acting as traders within the economy and a non negligible part of trade is done between related parties of multinational enterprise groups.
