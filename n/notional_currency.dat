50|$|A cross-currency swap's (XCS's) {{effective}} {{description is}} a derivative contract, agreed between two counterparties, which specifies {{the nature of}} an exchange of payments benchmarked against two interest rate indexes denominated in two different currencies. It also specifies an initial exchange of <b>notional</b> <b>currency</b> in each different currency and the terms of that repayment of <b>notional</b> <b>currency</b> {{over the life of}} the swap.|$|E
50|$|The coin was {{designed}} to replace the defunct gold hyperpyron as the highest-denomination coin in circulation. Hence it was made heavier than any previous Byzantine silver coin, or, for that matter, any contemporary European coin, weighing initially 8.5 grams but falling later to 7.4 grams. It still had only half {{the value of the}} hyperpyron however, which remained in use as a <b>notional</b> <b>currency.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{reform of the}} {{financial}} system {{has focused on the}} dollar's loss of international purchasing power (the Triffin dilemma) and its substitution by an international reserve currency that is not a national currency. The problem, however, is not the particular asset that serves as the international currency but rather the operation of the adjustment mechanism for dealing with global imbalances. In a preliminary report issued in May, the Commission of Experts of the President of the United Nations General Assembly on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System made clear that the international system suffers from an inherent tendency toward deficient aggregate demand, a reflection of the asymmetry in the international adjustment mechanism. Even the simple creation of a <b>notional</b> <b>currency</b> to be used in a clearing union (proposed by Keynes) cannot do this without some commitment to coordinated symmetric adjustment by both surplus and deficit countries. Thus, the first steps in the reform process must be (1) to offset the balance sheet losses caused by the collapse of asset values and (2) to provide an alternative source of demand to replace the U. S. consumer and an alternative source of finance to offset the deleveraging of financial institutions. This can be done through the coordinated introduction of traditional, countercyclical deficit expenditure policies, on a global scale. ...|$|E
50|$|To {{eliminate}} residual risk, {{match the}} foreign <b>currency</b> <b>notionals,</b> not the local <b>currency</b> <b>notionals,</b> else the foreign currencies received and delivered don't offset.|$|R
50|$|When hedging {{a foreign}} {{currency}} exposure, (say for an American USD business, an outflow of 11,000 JPY) {{it is the}} foreign <b>currency</b> <b>notional</b> that must be fixed.|$|R
5000|$|The more unconventional, but {{simpler to}} define, non-MTM XCS {{includes}} an upfront <b>notional</b> exchange of <b>currencies</b> with a re-exchange {{of that same}} notional at maturity of the XCS.|$|R
50|$|In a <b>currency</b> forward, the <b>notional</b> {{amounts of}} <b>currencies</b> are {{specified}} (ex: {{a contract to}} buy $100 million Canadian dollars equivalent to, say $75.2 million USD at the current rateâ€”these two amounts are called the notional amount(s)). While the notional amount or reference amount may be a large number, the cost or margin requirement to command or open such a contract is considerably less than that amount, which refers to the leverage created, which is typical in derivative contracts.|$|R
