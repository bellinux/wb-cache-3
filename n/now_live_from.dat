50|$|For most of {{the year}} the weekday editions of Soir 3 are {{broadcast}} at 10:30 pm from the set of the live cultural discussion show Ce soir (ou jamais!), which is broadcast immediately afterwards. During certain periods, such as over the summer break and on other holidays, the programme is however shown at various times and emanates from the France 3 news studio. In addition to a summary of the days news, the programme format includes several regular features such as sans détours (without detours, an extended interview with a prominent figure or expert) and lu, vu, entendu (read, seen and heard, which highlights a cultural medium such as a book, album or play). The latter of these is usually the last item in the bulletin.

Early in 1634, De With rejoined the navy for four months when Lieutenant-Admiral Philips van Dorp used the Prins Hendrik as his flagship for an expedition in the Gulf of Biscay. During the voyage it became clear that Vice-Admiral Jasper Liefhebber resented the domineering attitude of De With. Tensions between the two men became unbearable, and De With left his ship and thus the navy {{in the middle of the}} campaign. From October 1635 to October 1636, he was schepen in Brill; in 1636 also, his fourth child was born, Maria. In October 1637, he was appointed deacon in Brill. De With <b>now</b> mainly <b>lived</b> <b>from</b> rent on the land inherited from his parents, supplemented by a share in a river fishing vessel.|$|R
