The other categories are also shown to be equivalent with categories whose objects are sets of permutations with suitable extra properties. Up to now the equivalence between neardomains and sharply 2 -transitive groups was only known when both categories were equipped with the obvious isomorphisms as morphisms.

40|$|Planar nearrings play an {{important}} role in nearring theory, both from the structural side as being close to generalised <b>nearfields,</b> as well as from an applications perspective, in geometry and designs. We investigate the distributive elements of planar nearrings. If a planar nearring has nonzero distributive elements, then it is an extension of its zero multiplier part by an abelian group. In the case that there are distributive elements that are not zero multipliers, then this extension splits, giving an explicit description of the nearring. This generalises the structure of planar rings. We provide a family of examples where this does not occur, the distributive elements being precisely the zero multipliers. We apply this knowledge to the question of determining the generalized center of planar nearrings as well as finding new proofs of other older results. Comment: Submitte...|$|R
40|$|In this article, we {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} a dielectric nanolaser that is nanoscopic in all spatial dimensions. Our proposal is based on dielectric nanoparticles of high refractive index, e. g., silicon, acting as a (passive) cavity (without intrinsic gain) that is decorated with a thin film of organic gain media. Its resonance frequencies can be tuned over the entire visible range and bright and dark modes can be addressed. So called "magnetic" modes can be utilized, which makes this dielectric nanolaser a complementary source of coherent <b>nearfields</b> similar to the surface plasmon laser (which exploits electric modes). The small intrinsic losses in silicon yield relatively high quality factors and low non-radiative decay rates of emitters close to the cavity, both of which will lead to low thresholds. As we show in this work, the dielectric nanolaser exhibits certain advantages relative to nanowire lasers and spasers, such as reduced laser threshold, short switch-on times, size and design flexibility. The dielectric nanolaser is compatible with standard lithographic fabrication approaches and its relative simple design may allow for easy testing and realization of the concept. Thus, the silicon nanolaser might soon find many applications in nanooptics and metamaterials...|$|R

40|$|The {{active control}} of matter by strong {{electromagnetic}} fields is of growing importance, with applications {{all across the}} optical spectrum from the extreme-ultraviolet to the far-infrared. In recent years, phase-stable terahertz (THz) fields have shown tremendous potential in the observation and manipulation of elementary excitations in complex systems. The combination of concepts from attosecond science with advanced THz technology facilitates novel spectroscopic schemes, such as THz streaking. In general, driving charges at lower frequency enhances interaction energies and can promote drastically different dynamics. For example, mid-infrared excitation induces field-driven sub-cycle electron dynamics in nanostructure <b>nearfields.</b> Such frequency scalings will also impact nanostructure-based streaking, which has been theoretically proposed. Here, we experimentally demonstrate extensive control over nanostructure photoelectron emission using single-cycle THz transients. The locally enhanced THz near-field at a nanotip significantly amplifies or suppresses the detected photocurrent. We present field-driven streaking spectroscopy with spectral compression and expansion arising from electron propagation within the nanolocalized volume. THz near-field streaking produces rich spectrotemporal features and will yield unprecedented control over ultrashort electron pulses for imaging and spectroscopy. Comment: L. Wimmer and G.

40|$|Tapered diode lasers combine {{high output}} {{power and a}} beam quality near to the {{diffraction}} limit resulting in very high brightness. Therefore, they are finding use {{in a wide range}} of applications today, such as pumping of rare-earth-doped fibre amplifiers, tunable frequency doubling of diode lasers for blue-green outputs, and non linear spectroscopy. Due to increasing brightness and lifetime tapered lasers even become attractive for material processing and for telecom applications like pumping of Er-doped fiber amplifiers or raman amplifiers. In order to further enhance the brightness of tapered diode lasers the output power has to be increased while simultaneously the beam quality has to be kept near the diffraction limit. For this purpose we have grown low modal gain, single quantum well InGaAs/AlGaAs devices emitting at 976 nm by molecular beam epitaxy. The lateral design of the investigated laser diodes consist of a tapered section and a ridge-waveguide section. Since it has been shown by previous simulations and experiments that longer tapered sections allow higher output power with unchanged beam quality, we use tapered section lengths of 2000 µm, 3000 µm and 4000 µm. The beam quality parameter M(exp 2) and output powers as well as the <b>nearfields</b> of the different structures were carefully investigated. For longer devices we reach an optical output power of more than 10 W per single emitter in continuous wave mode (cw) without any distinct thermal rollover...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{two different}} measurement methods applied to ultrasound. The first method, Ultrasound doppler vector tomography, uses ultrasound to measure blood flow {{and the second}} method, Light diffraction tomography, measures the pressure field in an ultrasound beam with laser light. Both methods depend on tomography algorithms for reconstruction of the measured region. A prime motive for Ultrasound doppler vector tomography was to develop an automatic ultrasound based diagnostic scanning system for breast cancer screening. The special tomography algorithm used for detection of directional blood flow is described {{as well as the}} developed experimental system. Flow phantoms were measured and the results were compared with simulations, which show good agreement. The ongoing development of the method concerns improved tomography algorithms, better tissue-mimicking flow phantoms and ways to increase the spatial resolution. The main part of the thesis is about the development and use of Light diffraction tomography, which can be used for characterization of ultrasound fields. To our knowledge, only three laboratories worldwide have published results with this method and the subjects of the current work are to define, describe and expand the limits. Some of the most important advantages with light diffraction tomography are the non-perturbing character and the possibility to do absolute pressure measurements with high spatial resolution in both water and air. These advantages were exploited to measure 10 MHz transducers in water, close to the surfaces with high spatial resolution and to measure ultrasound in air in the frequency range 40 kHz – 2 MHz. The results show that under certain circumstances light diffraction tomography can be used for absolute measurements with an uncertainty on the order of 10 % in water and 13 % in air. Complex ultrasound <b>nearfields</b> were characterized and peaks separated 160 µm were resolved. The applicability on airborne ultrasound was investigated showing unique results regarding absolute measurements, spatial resolution, sensitivity, phase measurements and frequency response. The thesis also includes the Department of Electrical Measurements’ experience in the EC project “An assessment of medical ultrasonic field measurement methods”, the purpose of which was to evaluate a specific ultrasound measurement standard...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} {{theoretically}} that infinitely long fluid loaded plates in mean flow exhibit {{a range of}} unusual phenomena in the 'long time' limit. These include convective instability, absolute instability and negative energy waves which are destabilized by dissipation. However, structures are necessarily of finite length and may have discontinuities. We have undertaken an analytical and computational study to investigate the response of finite plates, and of plates with local inhomogeneities, to ascertain if these unusual effects might be realized in practice. Analytically, we adopt Crighton & Oswell’s (1991) structural acoustics approach and take a "wave scattering" [...] {{as opposed to a}} "modal superposition" [...] view of the fluttering plate problem. First, we derive the energy balance relations for the extended plate (i. e., plate with two sided flow, spring foundation and plate pretension) and define a generalized wave impedance valid for both positive energy waves (PEW) and negative energy waves (NEW). Next, we solve for the scattering coefficients of localized plate discontinuities using a multipole source approach. Our solutions are exact and include the <b>nearfields</b> due to fluid-loading effects. We introduce the concept of power normalized scattering coefficients, and show that overall power is conserved during the scattering process if the sign of the wave energy is preserved. We argue that energy conservation, combined with the presence of NEWs on the plate, are responsible for the phenomenon of over-scattering, or of amplified reflection/transmission. These are scattering processes that draw energy from the mean flow into the plate. Next, we use the Wiener-Hopf technique to solve for the scattering coefficients of a variety of plate leading and trailing edge conditions [...] including the flag like configuration of a free trailing edge with wake. We find that the edges are over-reflective in the frequency range where NEWs are present. The exception is a free trailing edge with wake where, remarkably, the wake is found to absorb almost all of the incident wave energy. We use combinations of these upstream and downstream edge reflection matrices to solve for the complex resonance frequencies of long, finite plates immersed in mean flow. Finally, we construct the response of a finite plate by a superposition of infinite plate propagating waves continuously scattering off the plate ends. We solve for the unstable resonance frequencies and temporal growth rates for long plates. We derive upper and lower bounds on the unstable growth rates of finite plates with given edge conditions. We find that a flag-like configuration of a clamped leading edge and a free trailing edge with wake is destabilized for sub-critical flow speeds only for very long plate lengths and only in the presence of convectively unstable waves. We present a comparison between direct computational results and the infinite plate theory. In particular, the resonance response of a moderately sized plate is shown to be in excellent agreement with the long plate analytical predictions.
