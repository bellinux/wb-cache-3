To lives this knowledge the psychiatric nurse must see patients as individual people with lives beyond their mental illness. Seeing people as individuals with lives beyond their mental illness is imperative in making patients feel valued and respected [...] In order {{to accept the}} patient as an individual, the psychiatric nurse must not be controlled {{by his or her}} own values, or by ideas and pre-understanding of mental health patients. Individual needs of patients are met by bending the rules of standard interventions and assessment. Psychiatric/mental health nurses spoke of the potential to 'bend the rules', which required an interpretation of the unit rules and the ability to evaluate the risks associated with bending them.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} proposal applies geostatistical techniques {{to discover the}} relationship between the geographic locations of different gas stations and the operational characteristics offered by the transport network of the city of Manizales. This research is supported by basic information gathered {{for more than a year}} using GPS equipment (more than 18 million records). The time <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> gas stations is calculated as well as the spatial coverage in terms of population and area. Graphical results are obtained and these explain the time <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> a particular gas station. Quantitative comparisons are made among the different types of gas stations and the sectors of the city lacking gas stations coverage are established...|$|R

Kerby advocated using social remedies to alleviate poverty. He embraced the progressive reforms of the period calling for child labor laws, fair wages, and public health reforms.

50|$|Châtillon {{enjoys a}} well {{connected}} bus service: from Paris, the 68 comes {{all the way}} from the Place de Clichy to the metro station. Buses 194, 195 and 295 all leave Porte d'Orléans and pass by the Châtillon - Montrouge metro station from where they continue mostly in different directions. The 162 running east and west of Châtillon can take you to the RER station in Meudon, or the shopping centre to the east. The 394 which passes by the market is ideal for Clamart, Vanves, and Issy-les-Moulineaux. If you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Issy from the metro, then take the 126.|$|E
50|$|Society has {{collapsed}} {{and most of}} the world's population have become zombies due to a virus outbreak. A year later, the protagonists (either Jack McReady, Scarlett Blake or both when played in co-op mode) are preparing to leave their shelter in search of food and water. They are immune to the current strain of the virus. After reaching a gas station, they pick up a radio transmission, but it is just static. They head to a police station, in search for a means to strengthen the radio signal, but find out they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> higher ground to do so.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} being Spacers, the medical staff insists on testing Derec for {{diseases}} that would be benign to Earthers but fatal to Spacers. Despite the prophylactic given to them by R. David (designed by Dr. Avery), he submits to the test. Derec is again impressed with Earth and is ashamed that he assumed they would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> a Spacer world for proper medical help. The reality is Earth hospitals deal with much more disease and injury than any Spacer hospital. The test results show he is healthy, but indicate he had once suffered from Amnemonic Plague, too, explaining his memory loss.|$|E

5000|$|Potential {{for growth}} of public transit is limited as most {{tourists}} come by car or tour buses. Niagara Falls Transit is very underused {{due to the}} poor route structure, infrequent route intervals. Half hour or 15 minute routes are non existent even at rush hour. There is also a lack of pedestrian friendly bus stops, no concrete padding at many stops with few bus shelters to accommodate riders. Hotels and the two casinos offer shuttle bus service around the Falls area. Taxis are also a common form of transportation in the city. Most commuters are locals who live away from the Falls area and <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> their workplace.|$|E
50|$|Gameplay {{is similar}} to the Mario Party series. It {{features}} a board game-like scenario. The player will have to roll a die with the Wii U Gamepad and depending on the number the die lands, the Rabbid will move to the corresponding square. These squares trigger a different feature and can be easily told apart just by looking at the symbol drawn on the square. Your primary goal is to win the board game by winning trophies, which can be collected by playing and winning minigames. Once a player has collected all trophies needed, you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the center. Once you get to the center, the game is over and the player can win prizes.|$|E

However, both connection points get easily congested, meaning the more players pass through a point the greater the delay of each player becomes, so having both players go through the same connection point causes extra delay.
