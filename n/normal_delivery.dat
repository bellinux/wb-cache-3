25|$|The actual {{duties of}} the midwife in antiquity {{consisted}} mainly of assisting in the birthing process, although they may also have helped with other medical problems relating to women when needed. Often, the midwife would call for {{the assistance of a}} physician when a more difficult birth was anticipated. In many cases the midwife brought along two or three assistants. In antiquity, it was believed by both midwives and physicians that a <b>normal</b> <b>delivery</b> was made easier when a woman sat upright. Therefore, during parturition, midwives brought a stool to the home where the delivery was to take place. In the seat of the birthstool was a crescent-shaped hole through which the baby would be delivered. The birthstool or chair often had armrests for the mother to grasp during the delivery. Most birthstools or chairs had backs which the patient could press against, but Soranus suggests that in some cases the chairs were backless and an assistant would stand behind the mother to support her. The midwife sat facing the mother, encouraging and supporting her through the birth, perhaps offering instruction on breathing and pushing, sometimes massaging her vaginal opening, and supporting her perineum during the delivery of the baby. The assistants may have helped by pushing downwards {{on the top of the}} mother's abdomen.|$|E

25|$|In cricket, {{a slider}} {{is a type}} of {{delivery}} bowled by a wrist spin bowler. Whereas a topspinner is released with the thumb facing the batsman, a slider is bowled in a similar manner to a legbreak, but instead of imparting sidespin with the third finger, the bowler allows his fingers to roll down the back of the ball, providing a mixture of sidespin and backspin. Whereas a topspinner tends to dip more quickly and bounce higher than a <b>normal</b> <b>delivery,</b> a slider does the opposite: it carries to a fuller length and bounces less than the batsman might expect. The sliders will typically head towards the batsman with a scrambled seam (with the ball not spinning {{in the direction of the}} seam, so the seam direction is not constant, unlike in conventional spin bowling). This has less effect on the flight and bounce but absence of leg spin may deceive the batsman. Frequently the slider is bowled with a mixture of side spin and backspin. This has the effect of making the ball harder to differentiate from the leg break for the batsmen without reducing the mechanical effects caused by the backspin. This delivery may skid straight on or it may turn a small amount.|$|E

2500|$|For {{otherwise}} healthy twin pregnancies where both twins are head down {{a trial of}} vaginal delivery is recommended at between 37 and 38 weeks. Vaginal delivery in this case does not worsen the outcome for either infant as compared with caesarean section. [...] There is some controversy on the best method of delivery where the first twin is head first {{and the second is}} not, but most obstetricians will recommend <b>normal</b> <b>delivery</b> unless there are other reasons to avoid vaginal birth. When the first twin is not head down, a caesarean section is often recommended. Regardless of whether the twins are delivered by section or vaginally, the medical literature recommends delivery of dichorionic twins at 38 weeks, and monochorionic twins (identical twins sharing a placenta) by 37 weeks due to the increased risk of stillbirth in monochorionic twins who remain in utero after 37 weeks. [...] The consensus is that late preterm delivery of monochorionic twins is justified because the risk of stillbirth for post-37 week delivery is significantly higher than the risks posed by delivering monochorionic twins near term (i.e., 36–37 weeks).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Acute pseudo-obstruction of {{the large}} bowel {{following}} <b>normal</b> vaginal <b>delivery</b> is an extremely rare complication of <b>normal</b> vaginal <b>delivery.</b> It can be fatal if not recognized early. Only one previous report {{has been found in}} the English literature. Case presentation A 36 -year old Caucasian, normally fit woman presented with abdominal distension and vomiting five days post-normal vaginal delivery at term. Localised peritonitis in the right iliac fossa developed in the next few days, and caecal perforation was found at laparotomy, without evidence of appendicitis or colitis. Conclusion Although very rare, Ogilvie's syndrome should be considered by obstetricians, general surgeons and general practitioners as a potential cause of vomiting and abdominal pain following <b>normal</b> vaginal <b>delivery.</b> Early recognition and management are essential to minimize the possibility of developing serious complications. </p...|$|R

50|$|Histotoxic hypoxia (also called histoxic hypoxia) is the {{inability}} of cells to take up or utilize oxygen from the bloodstream, despite physiologically <b>normal</b> <b>delivery</b> of oxygen to such cells and tissues.

50|$|Cord {{blood cells}} are {{obtained}} from the umbilical cord and placenta of a newborn baby after the cord is clamped and cut as in a <b>normal</b> <b>delivery.</b> The cord blood is then stored frozen in a bank until needed for a transplant.

Coexistence of these hemorrhages with skull fractures/intracranial hemorrhages secondary to mechanical birth trauma can lead to confusion with nonaccidental trauma.|$|R
