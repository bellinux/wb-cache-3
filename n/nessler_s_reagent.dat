40|$|An {{advanced}} oxidation process, {{which uses}} Fenton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Reagent</b> (H 2 O 2 /Fe 2 +), is {{studied in the}} destruction of three different classes of azo dyes. The optimal pH and stochiometry for H 202 and Fe 2 + in the oxidation of the azo dyes were investigated; an experimental optimal ratio was also compared to a theoretical optimal ratio of H 202 to Fe 2 +. The optimal oxidation of monoazo and disazo dyes is at pH 3 and pH 4, respectively. The optimal ratio for monoazo and disazo dyes ranged from 1 to 10. The experimentally determined optimal ratios are in excellent agreement with theoretically predicted optimal H 202 to Fe 2 + ratio of 11. Complexation was observed in oxidation of trisazo dye Direct Blue 71. A lower optimal ratio of H 202 to Fe 2 + for trisazo dye than ratios required for mono and disazo dyes, is due to a larger amount of Fe 2 + associated with Fe complexation of chromophore. Due to a relatively large amount of sludge, which is generated by the common Fenton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Reagent,</b> this study was expanded to characterize the performance of a novel H 202 and Fe powder system. This system decolorizes the same dyes from Fenton 2 ̆ 7 s treatment. Kinetics and mechanism of the reaction were studied.

Seventeen monosaccharides (acidic, neutral, basic, phosphorylated, and deoxy) and four disaccharides were assessed. PAS-positive carbohydrates (amino, N-acetylamino, deoxy, and certain neutral monosaccharides, and sialic acids) responded linearly within a 10 - 100 nmol range approximately, which varied for each carbohydrate. The assay response for fetuin and porcine gastric mucin (PGM) was linear up to 150 mu-g (highest concentration tested), with no response from nonglycosylated protein. A lower response for asialofetuin was observed, but desialylated PGM preparations were similar or higher in response than their sialylated counterparts.

Substantial reductions in both phenol and total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations were achieved without the necessity to degrade the phenol to its ultimate oxidation product, carbon dioxide. Polyethyleneimine was the most efficient of the polyamines studied and its efficiency increased with increasing molecular weight. Substituted phenols were oxidized in order to establish the optimum conditions for the Fenton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reagent</b> oxidation and the effect of phenolic substituent type and substitution pattern on the rate and extent of TOC reduction.

How QuorumSensing Connects Sporulation to Necrotrophism in Bacillus thuringiensis. PLoS Pathog 12 (8) :e 1005779. doi: 10. 1371 /journal. ppat. 1005779 Regulation of {{biological}} functions requires factors (proteins, peptides or chemicals) able to sense and translate environmental conditions or any circumstances {{in order to}} modulate the transcription of a gene, the stability of a transcript or the activity of a protein. Quorum sensing is a regulation mechanism connecting cell density to the physiological state of a single cell. In bacteria, quorum sensing coordinates virulence, cell fate and commitment to sporulation and other adaptation properties. The critical role of such regulatory systems was demonstrated in pathogenicity and adaptation of bacteria from the Bacillus cereus group (i. e. B. cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis). Furthermore, using insects {{as a model of}} infection, it was shown that sequential activation of several quorum sensing systems allowed bacteria to switch from a virulence state to a necrotrophic lifestyle, allowing their survival in the host cadaver, and ultimately to the commitment into sporulation. The chronological development of these physiological states is directed by quorum sensors forming the RNPP family. Among them, NprR combines two distinct functions connecting sporulation to necrotrophism in B. thuringiensis. In the absence of its cognate signaling peptide (NprX), NprR negatively controls sporulation by acting as a phosphatase. In the presence of NprX, it acts as a transcription factor regulating a set of genes involved in the survival of the bacteria in the insect cadaver...|$|R

Enzyme kinetics were performed with CaN in the presence of EDTA, Ca 2 +, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +, EGTA and Mg 2 +, Ca 2 + and Mn 2 + and Ca 2 + and Ni 2 +, ± calmodulin (CaM). The highest activity was observed when CaN was assayed in the presence of Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and CaM.

Conventionally, several different mechanisms were proposed for the enhanced dewaterability. This study firstly clarified the correlation between EPS structure/property changes and improved sludge dewaterability. The characteristics of both extracted EPS from waste activated sludge and the sludge itself before and after the treatment with the Fe(II) activated peroxidation process, i. e. Fenton 2 ̆ 7 s conditioning, were investigated. The treatment with Fenton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reagent</b> improved sludge dewaterability, with the EPS structure changed as well. It was found that both EPS and cells were solubilized by comparing the release of protein and polysaccharide from extracted EPS and sludge itself after peroxidation. The increased dewaterability was thus likely achieved through the destruction of both EPS (including loosely-bound and tightly-bound EPS) and cells by Fenton 2 ̆ 7 s conditioning while other mechanisms (i. e. flocculation/oxidization) played a secondary role.

The second part of chapter one overviews the solution and solid-phase synthesis of peptidyl thioacids and thioesters. The last section of chapter one reviews the importance of tetramic acid containing natural products, and the various methods for their formation, and continues with an overview of stereoselective methods for â-mannosylation, such as are required for the total synthesis of virgineone, a novel glycosylated tetramic acid containing natural product. The second chapter describes studies focused on {{the development of}} a methodology for the synthesis of amino and peptidyl thioacids based on the cleavage of the 9 -fluorenylmethyl (Fm) group from 9 -fluorenlylmethyl thioesters. Subsequently, the formation of native amide bonds in the reaction between C-terminal peptidyl thioacids and electron deficient N-terminal 2, 4 -dinitrobenzenesulfonamides is presented. In chapter three, building on the method for the solution-phase synthesis of amino and peptidyl thioacids described in chapter two, the development of a 9 -fluorenlylmethyl thioester based linker, N-[9 -(tritylthiomethyl) - 9 H-fluoren- 2 -yl]succinamic acid is described. The use of this linker for the synthesis of peptidyl thioacids on solid support employing Boc-SPPS is then demonstrated. In chapter four, continuing the theme of the development of the chemistry of thioacids, a method for the in situ generation of thioacids by the regioselective ring opening of â-thiolactones is set out. To further explore this concept, investigations were conducted on the ring-opening of various â-thiolactones with soft aromatic thiolates to form thiocarboxylates, with subsequent trapping in-situ by Mukaiyama 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reagent</b> or Sanger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reagent</b> in presence of an amine to form amide bonds. In chapter five, studies toward the assignment of configuration and the total synthesis of vigineone are described. A practical synthetic route to various stereoisomers of virgineone is elaborated. In chapter six, overall conclusions of the dissertation are presentated, while in chapter seven, the experimental procedures and characterization data for the synthesized compounds are documented...|$|R

The new cyclization proceeded with no observable racemization of chiral α-amino acids. With a β-amino acid the method gave a pyrimidine- 2, 4 -dione. Several alternative mechanisms by which this transformation might occur are described, {{one of which is}} preferred based on the experimental evidence available. Eight of the hydantoins synthesized using the new procedure were tested as potential anti-seizure drugs, but the compounds tested displayed little or no activity. ^ The possible conversion of α-amino acids to aziridinones (α-lactams) is discussed. The X-ray crystal structure of 3 -(4 '-bromophenyl) - 1 -tert-butylaziridinone is reported. The principal difference between the new crystal structure and the only previous X-ray crystal structure is the observation in the former of a distinct tilt of the lactam carbonyl group toward the nitrogen atom (and away from the α-carbon atom), an observation that is in accord with most calculated structures for the aziridinone ring. The solid state structure suggests that α-lactams exhibit considerable amide resonance. A careful nuclear magnetic resonance study of several typical aziridinones is described. ...|$|R

Only 31 of 73 (42 %) antisera were satisfactory. In many instances, the antisera gave negative, {{as opposed to}} weak, reactions when they should have given strong positive reactions. Four reagents cross-reacted with Shigella strains. Of the 19 polyvalent grouping antisera to subgroups Shigella dysenteriae serotypes 1 through 7, S. flexneri serotypes 1 through 6, S. boydii serotypes 1 through 7, and S. sonnei forms I, II, only one <b>S.</b> sonnei <b>reagent</b> and five <b>S.</b> flexneri <b>reagents</b> were satisfactory with {{greater than or equal}} to 90 % of the homologous strains. The reagent of poorest quality was satisfactory with only 18 % of the homologous strains. There were three polyvalent antisera to the higher types of S. dysenteriae and S. boydii, which were available from only one company, that adequately identified 80, 63, and 65 % of the homologous strains. Typing antisera were available from only two companies, and 30 of 51 (59 %) were satisfactory. Commercially available Shigella antisera are inadequate for the laboratory testing required for planning the development of and evaluating Shigella vaccines...|$|R
