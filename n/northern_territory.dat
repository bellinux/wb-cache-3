The ACT {{was the only}} other mainland territory, with a population greater than that of the <b>Northern</b> <b>Territory</b> that was growing faster, so it was suggested that if self-government was appropriate for the <b>Northern</b> <b>Territory,</b> then it must also be appropriate for the ACT.|$|E

50|$|In the meantime, the British became {{interested}} in the <b>Northern</b> <b>Territories</b> north of Ashanti, which they believed would forestall the advances of the French and the Germans. After 1896 protection was extended to northern areas whose trade with the coast had been controlled by Ashanti. In 1898 and 1899, European colonial powers amicably demarcated the boundaries between the <b>Northern</b> <b>Territories</b> and the surrounding French and German colonies. The <b>Northern</b> <b>Territories</b> were proclaimed a British protectorate in 1902. Like the Ashanti protectorate, the <b>Northern</b> <b>Territories</b> were placed under the authority of a resident commissioner who was responsible to the governor of the Gold Coast. The governor ruled both Ashanti and the <b>Northern</b> <b>Territories</b> by proclamations until 1946.|$|R

5|$|In 2000, the Ranger Uranium Mine in the <b>Northern</b> <b>Territory</b> and the Roxby Downs/Olympic Dam mine in South Australia {{continued}} to operate, but Nabarlek Uranium Mine had closed. A third uranium mine, Beverley Uranium Mine in SA, was also operating. Several advanced projects, such as Honeymoon in SA, Jabiluka in the <b>Northern</b> <b>Territory</b> and Yeelirrie in WA were on hold {{because of political}} and indigenous opposition.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>Northern</b> <b>Territory,</b> P. fimbriata has {{no special}} tactics against other jumping spiders {{and tries to}} treat {{them as if they}} were web spiders, and then either tries to jump on them or gives up. Hence this variant is poor at {{catching}} other jumping spiders. The <b>Northern</b> <b>Territory</b> variant of P. fimbriata is not as good as the Queensland one as catching web spiders, but better than the Sri Lanka variant and some other species of Portia. It is not enthusiastic about pursuing insects, but very good at catching those it pursues, as the performance table above shows While pursuits by the Queensland variant typically take 26minutes, those of the <b>Northern</b> <b>Territory</b> variant typically take 3 to 5minutes, like some other species of Portia.|$|E
