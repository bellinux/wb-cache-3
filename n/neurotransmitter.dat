5|$|Axons {{transmit}} {{signals to}} other neurons {{by means of}} specialized junctions called synapses. A single axon may make as many as several thousand synaptic connections with other cells. When an action potential, traveling along an axon, arrives at a synapse, it causes a chemical called a <b>neurotransmitter</b> to be released. The <b>neurotransmitter</b> binds to receptor molecules in the membrane of the target cell.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{is used as}} a <b>neurotransmitter</b> in most {{multicellular}} animals. In sponges {{there is}} only a single report of the presence of dopamine, with no indication of its function; however, dopamine has been reported in the nervous systems of many other radially symmetric species, including the cnidarian jellyfish, hydra and some corals. This dates the emergence of dopamine as a <b>neurotransmitter</b> back to the earliest appearance of the nervous system, over 500 million years ago in the Cambrian era. Dopamine functions as a <b>neurotransmitter</b> in vertebrates, echinoderms, arthropods, molluscs, and several types of worm.|$|E

5000|$|... (Chemical) Synaptic connection: At {{chemical}} synapses, pre-synaptic neurons release vesicles containing <b>neurotransmitters</b> {{into the}} synaptic cleft. The extracellular <b>neurotransmitters</b> then interact with particular post-synaptic transmembrane protein receptors {{to allow a}} fraction of the <b>neurotransmitters</b> into the post-synaptic neuron.|$|R
40|$|In this work, the {{potential}} of voltammetry as a simple and cheap electrochemical tool to investigate the redox properties of <b>neurotransmitters</b> is presented. It is shown that the redox features of some <b>neurotransmitters</b> can be effectively studied by voltammetry in a simple way. In addition, {{the determination of the}} kinetics of interaction of a series of common <b>neurotransmitters</b> (adrenaline, dopamine, serotonin) with pro-oxidative molecules or ions brings insights into the antagonistic substances that hinder the <b>neurotransmitters</b> functions. A theory of studying the transfer of some <b>neurotransmitters</b> across phospholipid membranes is also considered...|$|R
50|$|For <b>neurotransmitters</b> to be released, {{they first}} must {{be stored in}} {{synaptic}} vesicles. Reserpine works by inhibiting VMAT, preventing the storage of <b>neurotransmitters</b> into synaptic vesicles. If VMAT is inhibited, <b>neurotransmitters</b> won't be released into the synaptic cleft, thereby inhibiting their downstream effect.|$|R
5|$|With few exceptions, each neuron in {{the brain}} {{releases}} the same chemical <b>neurotransmitter,</b> or combination of neurotransmitters, at all the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons; this rule is known as Dale's principle. Thus, a neuron can be characterized by the neurotransmitters that it releases. The great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering specific <b>neurotransmitter</b> systems. This applies to drugs such as cannabinoids, nicotine, heroin, cocaine, alcohol, fluoxetine, chlorpromazine, and many others.|$|E
5|$|Brain {{activity}} {{is made possible}} by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets. A neuron consists of a cell body, axon, and dendrites. Dendrites are often extensive branches that receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons. The signals received may cause the neuron to initiate an action potential (an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse) which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal, to connect with the dendrites or with the cell body of another neuron. An action potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon, which contains a complex of proteins. When an action potential, reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a <b>neurotransmitter</b> at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on the target cell. These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. GABA is the major inhibitory <b>neurotransmitter</b> in the brain, and glutamate is the major excitatory <b>neurotransmitter.</b> Neurons link at synapses to form pathways and elaborate neural networks, and the activity between them is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1910 by George Barger and James Ewens at Wellcome Laboratories in London, England and first {{identified in the}} human brain by Kathleen Montagu in 1957. It was named dopamine {{because it is a}} monoamine whose precursor in the Barger-Ewens synthesis is 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa or L-DOPA). Dopamine's function as a <b>neurotransmitter</b> was first recognized in 1958 by Arvid Carlsson and Nils-Ã…ke Hillarp at the Laboratory for Chemical Pharmacology of the National Heart Institute of Sweden. Carlsson was awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for showing that dopamine is not only a precursor of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline), but is also itself a <b>neurotransmitter.</b>|$|E
50|$|VMAT {{functions}} in loading the <b>neurotransmitters</b> dopamine, serotonin, histamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine into transport vesicles. Collectively these <b>neurotransmitters</b> {{are referred to}} as monoamines. VMAT uses the same transport mechanism for all types of monoamines. VMATs transport monoamines from the cytosol into high-concentration storage vesicles. Transport vesicles are released into the space between neurons, called the synaptic cleft, where they convey a chemical message to the next neuron. VMATs also function in sorting, storing, and releasing <b>neurotransmitters,</b> and are believed to participate in protecting these <b>neurotransmitters</b> from autoxidation. VMATs are also known to continue biochemical modification after loading of certain <b>neurotransmitters.</b>|$|R
30|$|Largely through {{case studies}} {{involving}} medications, we implicate the <b>neurotransmitters</b> involved in hiccups. The reflex arc is potentially mediated by central <b>neurotransmitters</b> (GABA, dopamine, and serotonin) and peripheral <b>neurotransmitters</b> (epinephrine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and histamine). Lesions across {{any of these}} neuroanatomical structures, for instance, from the brainstem down to the diaphragm, {{may be responsible for}} the development of hiccups. Further research is needed to characterize the <b>neurotransmitters</b> involved in hiccups for potential new therapeutic targets.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Neurotransmitters</b> are {{released}} in discrete packets known as quanta from the axon terminal of one neuron to the dendrites of another across a synapse. These quanta {{have been identified}} by electron microscopy as synaptic vesicles. Two types of vesicles are small synaptic vessicles (SSVs), which are about 40-60nm in diameter, and large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs), electron-dense vesicles approximately 120-200nm in diameter. The former is derived from endosomes and houses <b>neurotransmitters</b> such as acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA, and glycine. The latter {{is derived from the}} Golgi apparatus and houses larger <b>neurotransmitters</b> such as catecholamines and other peptide <b>neurotransmitters.</b> <b>Neurotransmitters</b> {{are released}} from an axon terminal and bind to postsynaptic dendrites in the following procession: ...|$|R
5|$|Tbr1, {{along with}} Pax6 and Tbr2, {{has a role}} in glutamatergic {{projection}} neuron differentiation. Glutamatergic neurons make and release in an activity-dependent manner the excitatory <b>neurotransmitter</b> glutamate {{as opposed to the}} inhibitory <b>neurotransmitter</b> GABA. The transition from radial glial cells to postmitotic projection neurons occurs in three steps, each associated with one of the aforementioned transcription factors. The first starts out with the expression of Pax6 in radial glial cells found primarily at the ventricular surface. In the next step, Pax6 is downregulated and Tbr2 is expressed as the cell differentiates into an intermediate progenitor cell. Likewise, in the final step, Tbr2 is extremely downregulated to undetectable levels as Tbr1 signals the transition into a postmitotic projection neuron.|$|E
5|$|Acamprosate may {{stabilise}} {{the brain}} chemistry that is altered due to alcohol dependence via antagonising {{the actions of}} glutamate, a <b>neurotransmitter</b> which is hyperactive in the post-withdrawal phase. By reducing excessive NMDA activity which occurs {{at the onset of}} alcohol withdrawal, acamprosate can reduce or prevent alcohol withdrawal related neurotoxicity. Acamprosate reduces the risk of relapse amongst alcohol dependent persons.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines share {{a similar}} {{chemical}} structure, {{and their effects}} in humans are mainly produced by the allosteric modification of a specific kind of <b>neurotransmitter</b> receptor, the GABAA receptor, which increases the overall conductance of these inhibitory channels; this results in the various therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects of benzodiazepines. Other less important mechanisms of action are also known.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to conventional (anterograde) <b>neurotransmitters,</b> retrograde <b>neurotransmitters</b> are synthesized in the postsynaptic neuron, and bind to receptors on the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron.|$|R
25|$|<b>Neurotransmitters</b> are {{signaling}} {{molecules of}} the nervous system, also including neuropeptides and neuromodulators. <b>Neurotransmitters</b> like the catecholamines are also secreted by the endocrine system into the systemic circulation.|$|R
50|$|Chemical synapses {{allow for}} signal {{transmission}} by a presynaptic cell releasing <b>neurotransmitters</b> into the synapse to bind to receptors on a postsynaptic cell. These <b>neurotransmitters</b> are synthesized in the presynaptic cell and housed in vesicles until released. Once <b>neurotransmitters</b> are {{released into the}} synaptic cleft and a signal is relayed, re-uptake begins which {{is the process of}} transport proteins clearing out the <b>neurotransmitters</b> from the synapse and recycling them in order to allow for a new signal to be propagated. If stimulation is occurring at a high enough frequency and with enough strength, <b>neurotransmitters</b> will be released at a faster rate than re-uptake can recycle them which will ultimately deplete them until there are no longer readily releasable vesicles and a signal can no longer be transmitted.|$|R

5|$|It is {{theorized that}} the use of birth control pills should affect eating {{behaviour}} as they minimise or remove the fluctuations in hormone levels. The <b>neurotransmitter</b> serotonin is also thought {{to play a role in}} food intake. Serotonin is responsible for inhibiting eating and controlling meal size, among other things, and is modulated in part by ovarian hormones.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of neurons {{in the deep}} nuclei have large cell bodies and spherical dendritic trees with a radius of about 400Î¼m, and use glutamate as their <b>neurotransmitter.</b> These cells project {{to a variety of}} targets outside the cerebellum. Intermixed with them are a lesser number of small cells, which use GABA as a <b>neurotransmitter</b> and project exclusively to the inferior olivary nucleus, the source of climbing fibers. Thus, the nucleo-olivary projection provides an inhibitory feedback to match the excitatory projection of climbing fibers to the nuclei. There is evidence that each small cluster of nuclear cells projects to the same cluster of olivary cells that send climbing fibers to it; there is strong and matching topography in both directions.|$|E

The spheres located in the upper neuron contain <b>neurotransmitters</b> that fuse with the {{presynaptic}} membrane and release <b>neurotransmitters</b> into the synaptic cleft. These <b>neurotransmitters</b> bind to receptors located on the postsynaptic membrane of the lower neuron, and, {{in the case of}} an excitatory synapse, may lead to a depolarization of the postsynaptic cell.|$|R
30|$|Dopamine and {{serotonin}} are {{two powerful}} <b>neurotransmitters</b> that affect oneâ€™s mood and happiness. In general, <b>neurotransmitters</b> are chemical messengers which neurons use to tell other neurons {{that they have}} received an impulse.|$|R
50|$|Tomas HÃ¶kfelt's early {{research}} was on <b>neurotransmitters</b> and neuropeptides in the brain. In 1977 {{he discovered that}} non-neurotransmitter peptide molecules like somatostatin, can exist with <b>neurotransmitters</b> in same peripheral and central neurons.|$|R
5|$|The oldest, {{on which}} most {{currently}} available drug therapies are based, is the cholinergic hypothesis, which proposes that AD {{is caused by}} reduced synthesis of the <b>neurotransmitter</b> acetylcholine. The cholinergic hypothesis has not maintained widespread support, largely because medications intended to treat acetylcholine deficiency have not been very effective. Other cholinergic effects have also been proposed, for example, initiation of large-scale aggregation of amyloid, leading to generalised neuroinflammation.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} ways in which {{epilepsy}} occurs. Examples of pathological physiology include: unusual excitatory connections within the neuronal network of the brain; abnormal neuron structure leading to altered current flow; decreased inhibitory <b>neurotransmitter</b> synthesis; ineffective receptors for inhibitory neurotransmitters; insufficient breakdown of excitatory neurotransmitters leading to excess; immature synapse development; and impaired function of ionic channels.|$|E
5|$|As {{with similar}} {{substances}} with a sedative-hypnotic mechanism, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, withdrawal from alcohol dependence {{can be fatal}} {{if it is not}} properly managed. Alcohol's primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the GABAA receptor, promoting central nervous system depression. With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in tolerance and physical dependence. When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled synapse firing. This can result in symptoms that include anxiety, life-threatening seizures, delirium tremens, hallucinations, shakes and possible heart failure. Other <b>neurotransmitter</b> systems are also involved, especially dopamine, NMDA and glutamate.|$|E
5000|$|Direct-acting antagonist- {{which takes}} up space present on receptors which are {{otherwise}} {{taken up by}} <b>neurotransmitters</b> themselves. This results in <b>neurotransmitters</b> being blocked from binding to the receptors. The most common is called Atropine.|$|R
50|$|The putamen {{also plays}} a role in {{modulation}} of other <b>neurotransmitters.</b> It releases GABA, enkephalin, substance P, and acetylcholine. It receives serotonin and glutamate. The majority of these <b>neurotransmitters</b> play a role in motor control.|$|R
40|$|<b>Neurotransmitters</b> {{are also}} {{involved}} in functions other than conventional signal transfer between nerve cells, such as development, plasticity, neurodegeneration, and neuroprotection. For example, there is {{a considerable amount of}} data indicating developmental roles for the glutamatergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic, GABA-ergic, and ATP/adenosine systems. In this review, we discuss the existing literature on these "new" functions of <b>neurotransmitters</b> in relation to some unconventional <b>neurotransmitters,</b> such as the endocannabinoids and nitric oxide. Data indicating both transcriptional and post-transcriptional modulation of endocannabinoid and nitrinergic systems after neural lesions are discussed in relation to the non-conventional roles of these <b>neurotransmitters.</b> Knowledge of the roles of <b>neurotransmitters</b> in brain functions other than information transfer is critical for a more complete understanding of the functional organization of the brain and to provide more opportunities for the development of therapeutical tools aimed at minimizing neuronal death.

These include the nucleus accumbens, nucleus basalis, diagonal band of Broca, substantia innominata, and the medial septal nucleus. These structures are important in producing the <b>neurotransmitter,</b> acetylcholine, which is then distributed widely throughout the brain. The basal forebrain, in particular the nucleus basalis, is considered to be the major cholinergic output of the central nervous system to the striatum and neocortex.|$|E
5|$|Calcium is {{the fifth}} most {{abundant}} element {{in the human body}} and the most abundant metal. Calcium ions {{play a vital role in}} the physiology and biochemistry of organisms and the cell as electrolytes. They play an important role in signal transduction pathways, where they act as a second messenger, in <b>neurotransmitter</b> release from neurons, in contraction of all muscle cell types, and in fertilization. Many enzymes require calcium ions as a cofactor. Calcium ions outside cells are also important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes, as well as proper bone formation.|$|E

Fatty esters include important biochemical intermediates such as wax esters, fatty acid thioester coenzyme A derivatives, fatty acid thioester ACP derivatives and fatty acid carnitines. The fatty amides include N-acyl ethanolamines, such as the cannabinoid <b>neurotransmitter</b> anandamide.|$|E
