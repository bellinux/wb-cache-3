5|$|Bessières and Nansouty led {{these men}} forward, through {{a hail of}} cannonballs and case-shot, with the carabiniers-à-cheval at the front. Finding a weaker spot in the Austrian line, they pierced it and stormed past the enemy {{infantry}} formed in squares, sabering the Georger Grenzer battalion as they went along their way. However, many of the French cavalry did not manage to penetrate through the formidable masses of Austrian infantry, so Nansouty was now commanding a much diminished force. Showing great skill in handling his men, Nansouty then wheeled right and charged Liechtenstein's artillery line. However, the Austrian cavalry promptly intervened, spearheaded by the Rosenberg chevaulegers and the Kronprinz cuirassier regiments, which caught the carabiniers-à-cheval in flank and repulsed them, pursuing {{them back to their}} lines. The costly repulse of Nansouty's division did not dishearten Bessières, who was preparing another rapid charge, now with the support of elements of the Guard cavalry. This charge never came, as the Marshal's horse was killed by a cannonball, with Bessières also hit and carried unconscious behind the lines. With his commander presumed dead, Nansouty did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Emperor's orders were and thus promptly decided to pull back his men, to avoid further damage to his already battered division.|$|E

25|$|The {{squadron}} entered Genoa on 17 October and Bedford ranged alongside Modeste. Accounts then differ as to {{what happened}} next. A later French account stated that the British ship had moored alongside, and her master had civilly requested the French ship remove a boat that was hampering the British manoeuvres. The French readily agreed, but half an hour later the British captain asked the French to hoist the white flag, saying that he did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> tricolour was. Offended, the French refused, whereupon the British suddenly attacked the unprepared French, and captured the frigate. One British account states that Bedford came alongside and after warning the French not to resist, captured her after a short struggle, while another stated that while the fort was saluting the arrival of Rear-Admiral Gell, the French on Modeste came up on deck and behaved with such insolent gestures and language that the British attacked them. The British reported that two Frenchmen had been killed during the fighting on the tartanes, while French sources alternately reported five dead, thirty wounded, or between 30 and 40 killed. The attack outraged the Genoese, who were being threatened both by Drake and by representatives of the French republic, and created a diplomatic incident. The Genoes finally bowed to French pressure and ordered the expulsion of all foreigners, {{with the exception of the}} French. The Genoese broke all diplomatic ties; in response Gell's squadron began to blockade Genoa, capturing neutral merchants bound for the city.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} {{to one of}} these incidents, a friend of Lead Belly's, variously identified as either Lomax or Mary Elizabeth Barnicle joked that Washington was a [...] "bourgeois town." [...] Though Lead Belly did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> word [...] "bourgeois" [...] meant, he was fascinated by the sound of it, and after its meaning was explained to him he decided to incorporate it into a song about the trip. The song came together quickly; one account claims that it only took a few hours for Lead Belly to write it. Lomax liked it because it was partly based on what happened in his apartment.|$|E

Jim {{does not know}} what a rundown is, but is too embarrassed to ask because he has been making such a poor {{impression}} with Charles. Jim spends much of the day {{trying to figure out what}} a rundown is, making several failed attempts to figure it out by chatting vaguely about it with Charles and other coworkers. When he finally finishes what he believes is a rundown, Charles does not look at it and simply asks Jim to fax it to everyone on the distribution list.

500|$|In December 2012, the Department of Health in the Philippines {{launched}} a [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] dance {{campaign against the}} use of firecrackers to celebrate the New Year. [...] Janine Tugonon, 2012 Miss Universe 1st runner-up, joined and danced on one of their campaign at Pandacan, Manila. [...] According to the Department's Assistant Secretary, Dr. Eric Tayag, the popularity of the song will attract people especially children to use safer means of celebration such as dancing [...] "Gangnam Style". [...] In contrast, the Philippine National Police was confirming intelligence reports about a firecracker named [...] "Gangnam bomb", which supposedly produced by illegal firecracker makers in Bocaue, Bulacan and apparently riding on the popularity of the song.

500|$|The exact {{status of}} Abkhazia as a [...] "treaty republic" [...] was never {{clarified}} during its existence, and historian Arsène Saparov {{has suggested that}} even officials at the time did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> phrase meant. However it had symbolic meaning to the Abkhaz people, who never forgot that they had, at least in theory, an independent state. With the advent of glasnost and perestroika in the 1980s, calls for Abkhazia to restore its status began; an assembly at Lykhny in 1989 issued {{a call to the}} Soviet authorities to make Abkhazia a full union republic, claiming the SSR Abkhazia as a precedent for this move. When Abkhazia declared independence in 1990, it called for the restoration of the 1925 constitution; as it called for Abkhazia and Georgia to unite, this allowed for the possibility of a future union between the two states. The restoration of the 1925 constitution would serve as a pretext for the 1992–1993 war, and the ensuing dispute over the status of Abkhazia, which has led to Abkhazia being de facto independent of Georgia since the outbreak of the war in 1992.|$|E

500|$|... "Turtles All the Way Down" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by television commentators. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review. He {{also noted that}} parts of the episode were [...] "surprising", and that [...] "the show embraced some final insanity before the end, it’s more the illusion of depth than actual depth". Handlen wrote that [...] "it’s hard to ask for more from an hour of television", despite noting that he was [...] "glad the series got cancelled". Handlen noted that he would [...] "look forward to their next projects". Handlen concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of [...] "B". Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a positive review and claimed {{that there were some}} [...] "gut-wrenching" [...] scenes in the episode. Fowler also opined that the episode was [...] "thrilling", [...] "frustrating", [...] "fascinating", and [...] "terrible" [...] to see Hannah [...] "crying over an arrested Britten". Fowler wrote that he [...] "love the open ending". Noting that Awake was [...] "one of the good ones", Fowler concluded his review by giving the episode a [...] "9.5 out of 10" [...] classifying it as [...] "amazing". Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic gave the episode a positive review. He opined that Michael [...] "has a unique ability to dream in a way that feels real, why not recreate what was once lost". McHatton found it [...] "fitting that the show ended with Michael closing his eyes.

500|$|A {{few years}} later, Griswold {{moved back to}} New York City, leaving his younger {{daughter}} {{in the care of}} the Myers family and his elder daughter, Emily, with relatives on her mother's side. He had by now earned the nickname [...] "Grand Turk", and in the summer of 1847 made plans to edit an anthology of poetry by American women. He believed that women were incapable of the same kind of [...] "intellectual" [...] poetry as men and believed they needed to be divided: [...] "The conditions of aesthetic ability in the two sexes are probably distinct, or even opposite", he wrote in his introduction. The selections he chose for The Female Poets of America were not necessarily the greatest examples of poetry but instead were chosen because they emphasized traditional morality and values. That same year, Griswold began working on what he considered [...] "the maximum opus of his life", an extensive biographical dictionary. Although he worked on it for several years and even advertised for it, it was never produced. He also helped Elizabeth F. Ellet publish her book Women of the American Revolution, and was angered when she did not acknowledge his assistance in the book. In July 1848, he visited poet Sarah Helen Whitman in Providence, Rhode Island, although he had been suffering with vertigo and exhaustion, rarely leaving his apartment at New York University, and was unable to write without taking opium. In autumn of that year, he had an epileptic fit, the first of many he would suffer for the remainder of his life. One fit caused him to fall out of a ferry in Brooklyn and nearly drown. He wrote to publisher James T. Fields: [...] "I am in a terrible condition, physically and mentally. I do <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> end will be... I am exhaustedbetwixt life and deathand heaven and hell." [...] In 1849, he was further troubled when Charles Fenno Hoffman, with whom he had become good friends, was committed to an insane asylum.|$|E

2500|$|It is on such {{evidence}} that psychologists assume {{the existence of}} an unconscious psyche – though many scientists and philosophers deny its existence.

But that is exactly what it does imply – quite correctly. And {{it is one of the}} curses of modern man that many people suffer from this divided personality. It is by no means a pathological symptom; it is a normal fact that can be observed at any time and anywhere. It is not merely the neurotic whose right hand does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> left is doing.
