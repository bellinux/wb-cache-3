40|$|At {{the onset}} of the study, {{participants}} provided measures of their social support, familiarity with the environment, and emotionality. Participants then entered data daily for 2 weeks about their daily mood and the events that occurred each day. A series of multilevel random coefficient modeling analyses found that daily negative events co-varied with measures of negative affect and daily positive events co-varied with measures of positive affect, self-esteem, and depression. Participants who reported higher measures of trait-level anxiety were found to have significantly lower mean levels of daily self-esteem. Both anxiety and fearfulness were found <b>to</b> be <b>negatively</b> related <b>to</b> BDI measures, and <b>negatively</b> related <b>to</b> positive deactive affect.
