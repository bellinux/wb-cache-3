25|$|Although not {{formally}} a quinolone, <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is considered the}} first quinolone drug. It was introduced in 1962 for treatment of urinary tract infections in humans. <b>Nalidixic</b> <b>acid</b> was discovered by George Lesher and coworkers in a distillate during an attempt at chloroquine synthesis. <b>Nalidixic</b> <b>acid</b> is thus {{considered to be the}} predecessor of all members of the quinolone family, including the second, third and fourth generations commonly known as fluoroquinolones. Since the introduction of <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid</b> in 1962, more than 10,000 analogs have been synthesized, but only a handful have found their way into clinical practice. The first generation also included other quinolone drugs, such as pipemidic acid, oxolinic acid, and cinoxacin, which were introduced in the 1970s. They proved to be only marginal improvements over <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
25|$|H. larsenii is {{resistant}} to the following antibiotics: ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamicin, <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid,</b> neomycin, penicillin G, rifampicin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. The organism is sensitive to bacitracin and novobiocin. Antibiotic sensitivity and resistance was determined using the agar diffusion test in which paper discs saturated with antibiotics were placed on agar plates.|$|E
25|$|Many {{substances}} {{are potentially}} harmful {{to people with}} G6PD deficiency. Variation {{in response to these}} substances makes individual predictions difficult. Antimalarial drugs that can cause acute hemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency include primaquine, pamaquine, and chloroquine. There is evidence that other antimalarials may also exacerbate G6PD deficiency, but only at higher doses. Sulfonamides (such as sulfanilamide, sulfamethoxazole, and mafenide), thiazolesulfone, methylene blue, and naphthalene should also be avoided by people with G6PD deficiency as they antagonize folate synthesis, as should certain analgesics (such as phenazopyridine and acetanilide) and a few non-sulfa antibiotics (<b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid,</b> nitrofurantoin, isoniazid, dapsone, and furazolidone). Henna has been known to cause hemolytic crisis in G6PD-deficient infants. Rasburicase is also contraindicated in G6PD deficiency. High dose intravenous vitamin C has also been known to cause haemolysis in G6PD deficiency carriers, thus G6PD deficiency testing is routine before infusion of doses of 25g or more.|$|E
2500|$|Structurally related first {{generation}} drugs, but formally not 4-quinolones, include cinoxacin (Cinobac), <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid</b> (NegGam, Wintomylon), and piromidic acid (Panacid), pipemidic acid (Dolcol) ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{generation}} of the quinolones began following introduction of the related, but structurally distinct naphthyridine-family <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid</b> in 1962 for treatment of urinary tract infections in humans. <b>Nalidixic</b> <b>acid</b> was discovered by George Lesher and coworkers in a chemical distillate during an attempt at synthesis of the chloroquinoline antimalarial agent, chloroquine. Naphthyridone and quinolone classes of antibiotics prevent bacterial DNA replication by inhibition of DNA unwinding events, and can be both bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal. (See Mechanism of Action later.) The majority of quinolones in clinical use belong to the second generation class of [...] "fluoroquinolones", which have a true quinoline framework, maintain the C-3 carboxylic acid group, and add a fluorine atom to the all-carbon containing ring, typically at the C-6 or C-7 positions.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{members of}} the {{quinolone}} antibacterial class were relatively low potency drugs such as <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid,</b> used mainly {{in the treatment of}} urinary tract infections owing to their renal excretion and propensity to be concentrated in urine. [...] In 1979 the publication of a patent filed by the pharmaceutical arm of Kyorin Seiyaku Kabushiki Kaisha disclosed the discovery of norfloxacin, and the demonstration that certain structural modifications including the attachment of a fluorine atom to the quinolone ring leads to dramatically enhanced antibacterial potency.|$|E
2500|$|Competence is {{specifically}} induced by DNA damaging conditions. [...] For instance, transformation is induced in Streptococcus pneumoniae by the DNA damaging agents mitomycin C (a DNA crosslinking agent) and fluoroquinolone (a topoisomerase inhibitor that causes double-strand breaks). [...] In B. subtilis, transformation is increased by UV light, a DNA damaging agent. In Helicobacter pylori, ciprofloxacin, which interacts with DNA gyrase and introduces double-strand breaks, induces expression of competence genes, thus enhancing {{the frequency of}} transformation Using Legionella pneumophila, Charpentier et al. tested 64 toxic molecules to determine which of these induce competence. [...] Of these only six, all DNA damaging agents, caused strong induction. [...] These DNA damaging agents were mitomycin C (which causes DNA inter-strand crosslinks), norfloxacin, ofloxacin and <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid</b> (inhibitors of DNA gyrase that cause double-strand breaks), bicyclomycin (causes single- and double-strand breaks), and hydroxyurea (induces DNA base oxidation). [...] UV light also induced competence in L. pneumophila. [...] Charpentier et al. suggested that competence for transformation probably evolved as a DNA damage response.|$|E

5000|$|Cinoxacin {{is one of}} the {{original}} quinolone drugs, which were introduced in the 1970s. Commonly referred to as the first generation quinolones. This first generation also included other quinolone drugs such as pipemidic acid, and oxolinic acid, but this first generation proved to be only marginal improvements over <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid.</b> Cinoxacin is similar chemically (and in antimicrobial activity) to oxolonic acid and <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid.</b> Relative to <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid,</b> cinoxacin was found to have a slightly greater inhibitory and bactericidal activity. Cinoxacin was patented in 1972 and assigned to Eli Lilly. [...] Eli Lilly obtained approval from the FDA to market cinoxacin in the United States as Cinobac on June 13, 1980. Prior to this cinobac was marketed in the U.K. and Switzerland in 1979.|$|E

50|$|E. meningoseptica grows well {{on blood}} agar and {{chocolate}} agar. Colonies are very pale yellow {{and may not}} be easily evident at 24 hours. Strains growing better at 40 °C are mostly associated with invasive meningitis. There is often a greyish discoloration around the colonies on blood agar due to proteases and gelatinase. E. meningoseptica grow poorly on MacConkey agar and are considered glucose oxidizers. They do not grow on CNA (colistin <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid)</b> agar because, although they are resistant to colistin, they are susceptible to quinolones such as <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
50|$|Not all {{antibiotics}} {{are produced}} by bacteria; some are made completely synthetically in the lab. These include the quinolone class, of which <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid</b> is often credited as {{the first to be}} discovered. Like other antibiotics before it the discovery of <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid</b> has been chalked up to an accident, discovered when George Lesher was attempting to synthesize chloroquine. However a recent investigation into the origin of quinolones have discovered that a description for quinolones happened in 1949 and that patents were filed concerning quinolones some 5 years before Lesher's discovery.|$|E
5000|$|The {{quinolones}} (including <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid</b> and ciprofloxacin). Quinolones bind {{to these}} enzymes and {{prevent them from}} [...] replicating DNA. Quinolone-resistant bacteria frequently harbor mutated topoisomerases that resist quinolone binding.|$|E
50|$|Sensitivity to novobiocin, bacitracin, anisomycin, aphidicolin, and {{rifampicin}} {{have been}} observed. However, no sensitivity {{has been shown}} to ampicillin, penicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, neomycin, <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid,</b> nystatin, tetracycline, streptomycin, or kanamycin.|$|E
5000|$|Topoisomerase inhibitors {{can also}} {{function}} as antibacterial agents. Quinolones (including <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid</b> and ciprofloxacin) have this function. [...] Quinolones bind to these enzymes and {{prevent them from}} decatenation replicating DNA.|$|E
50|$|Various {{antibiotics}} such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives, nitrofurans, sulfonamides, and trimethoprim {{can be used}} {{to treat}} the fish. Resistance is emerging, however. A vaccine against V. anguillarum is available.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{compounds}} {{produced by}} this company were often known by their manufacturing code {{which consisted of}} the abbreviation WIN (for Winthrop) followed by a number. For example, WIN 18,320 was <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid,</b> the first quinolone antibiotic.|$|E
50|$|To {{increase}} {{recovery of}} GBS, swabs {{can also be}} inoculated previously into a selective enrichment broth medium, such as the Todd-Hewitt broth supplemented with gentamicin or colistin and <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid</b> and incubated for 18-24 hours at 35-37 °C.|$|E
50|$|Methyl violet 10B {{inhibits}} {{the growth}} of many Gram positive bacteria, except streptococci. When {{used in conjunction with}} <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid</b> (which destroys gram-negative bacteria), {{it can be used to}} isolate the streptococci bacteria for the diagnosis of an infection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nalidixic</b> <b>acid</b> is {{effective}} primarily against gram-negative bacteria, with minor anti-gram-positive activity. In lower concentrations, it acts in a bacteriostatic manner; that is, it inhibits growth and reproduction. In higher concentrations, it is bactericidal, {{meaning that it}} kills bacteria instead of merely inhibiting their growth.|$|E

50|$|Certain {{strains of}} {{salmonella}} in ground turkey resist antibiotics. Ankara University’s study found salmonella in ground turkey resisted 25% of <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid,</b> 17% of streptomycin, and 15% of tetracycline. Overall, approximately {{one out of}} ten of the samples had salmonella strains that were resistant to four or more antibiotics.|$|E
50|$|Helicobacter rodentium is a {{bacterium}} in the Helicobacteraceae family, Campylobacterales order. It is a spiral-shaped bacterium with a bipolar, single, nonsheathed flagellum. It is resistant to cephalothin and <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid.</b> Its type strain is MIT 95-1707 (= ATCC 700285). Its name {{refers to the}} species first being isolated from mice.|$|E
50|$|H. larsenii is {{resistant}} to the following antibiotics: ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamicin, <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid,</b> neomycin, penicillin G, rifampicin, streptomycin, and tetracycline.

50|$|R. binae grow well on YEMA medium agar, {{where they}} form colonies which are circular, convex and creamy white. Strains survive at pH values between 5.5 and 10. They are very {{sensitive}} to ampicillin and resistant to kanamycin and <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid.</b> Strains do not tolerate tetracycline and do not grow on LB medium.|$|E
50|$|Low {{levels of}} {{penicillin}} and <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid</b> are {{also present in}} LJ medium to inhibit growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, to limit growth to Mycobacterium species only. Presence of malachite green in the medium inhibits most other bacteria. It is disinfected and solidified by a process of inspissation. Presence of glycerol enhances the growth of M. tuberculosis.|$|E
50|$|The {{stimulant}} {{properties of}} AFA were discovered serendipitously at Sterling-Winthrop {{in the midst}} of research on the antibiotic <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid.</b> In addition to behaving as antibiotics, it was found that many derivatives of <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid</b> have either stimulant or depressant effects on the central nervous system. Researchers at Sterling-Winthrop found that AFA had a higher potency and therapeutic index than cocaine or amphetamine and so it was singled out for further study. A small number of clinical trials were held in the 1970s, but when it was found that AFA exacerbated psychotic symptoms in schizophrenic patients and produced undesirable stimulant properties in geriatric depressives clinical evaluation of AFA was discontinued. AFA remains a widely used pharmacological tool for study of the brain's reward system, dopamine pathways, and the dopamine transporter. Since 2013 AFA has been sold on the gray market and there are numerous anecdotal reports detailing its non-medical use.|$|E
50|$|It {{is also a}} tool {{in studies}} as a {{regulation}} of bacterial division. It selectively and reversibly blocks DNA replication in susceptible bacteria. <b>Nalidixic</b> <b>acid</b> and related antibiotics inhibit a subunit of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV and induce formation of cleavage complexes. It also inhibits the nicking-closing activity on the subunit of DNA gyrase that releases the positive binding stress on the supercoiled DNA.|$|E
5000|$|Helicobacter bilis is a {{bacterium}} in the Helicobacteraceae family, Campylobacterales order. It is a [...] bacterium with three to 14 multiple bipolar sheathed flagella and periplasmic fibers {{wrapped around the}} cell. It is resistant to cephalothin and <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid,</b> but sensitive to metronidazole. Like Helicobacter hepaticus, it colonizes the bile, liver, and intestine of mice, and is associated with multifocal chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular tumors.|$|E
50|$|Hives, rash, intense itching, or fainting {{soon after}} a dose {{may be a}} sign of anaphylaxis. Common adverse effects include rash, itchy skin, blurred or double vision, halos around lights, changes in color vision, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. <b>Nalidixic</b> <b>acid</b> may also cause convulsions and hyperglycaemia, {{photosensitivity}} reactions, and sometimes haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia or leukopenia. Particularly in infants and young children, has been reported occasionally increased intracranial pressure.|$|E
50|$|R. lentis grow well on YEMA medium agar, {{where they}} form colonies which are circular, convex and creamy white. These {{bacteria}} grow at 12-37 °C but can survive at temperatures {{as low as}} 4 °C. Strains grow well at pH 5.5 to 8.2. Most of the strains studied are resistant to ampicillin, kanamycin and <b>nalidixic</b> <b>acid.</b> Strains do not tolerate tetracycline and do not show any growth on LB medium.|$|E
