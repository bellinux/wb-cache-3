60|$|He {{sat beside}} {{a heap of}} half-read books, marked <b>newspapers,</b> <b>clippings</b> and letters, a welter of {{concerns}} which he refused to have removed by the broom of the caretaker, and now and again as he wished to show me something he rose and hobbled {{a step or two}} to fish a book or a letter out of the pile. He was quite lame but could move without a crutch. He talked mainly of his good friends in Boston and elsewhere, and alluded to his enemies without a particle of rancor. The lines on his noble face were as placid as those on the brow of an ox--not one showed petulance or discouragement. He was the optimist in every word.|$|R

I love to make history but hate to write it."The work inevitably led to disagreements. Stanton's daughter Margaret reported that [...] "Sometimes these disputes run so high that down go the pens, one sails out of one door and {{one out of the}} other, walking in opposite directions around the estate, and just as I have made up my mind that this beautiful friendship of forty years has at last terminated, I see them walking down the hill, arm in arm." ...|$|R

5|$|In {{previous}} works, Hergé {{had drawn}} upon {{a variety of}} pictorial sources, such as <b>newspaper</b> <b>clippings,</b> from which to draw the scenes and characters; for The Secret of the Unicorn he drew upon an unprecedented variety of these sources.
