5|$|Most of the region's fauna {{is typical}} of desert environments. Species include the red kangaroo, the eastern wallaroo (also known as the euro), the {{northern}} nail-tail wallaby, and the spinifex hopping mouse. The central pebble-mound mouse also occurs in the region, and other mammal species including the Forrest's mouse, desert mouse and short-beaked echidna have been predicted by biologists to occur on the station. The station may lie {{within the range of}} the critically endangered <b>night</b> <b>parrot</b> (Pezoporus occidentalis). There is relatively high diversity and abundance of reptiles, including the military dragon (Ctenophorus isolepis gularis) and the sand goanna (Varanus gouldii flavirufus).|$|E

500|$|In 1953, the Japanese ornithologist Masauji Hachisuka {{suggested}} the broad-billed parrot was nocturnal, like the kakapo and the <b>night</b> <b>parrot,</b> two extant ground-dwelling parrots. Contemporary accounts do not corroborate this, and the orbits are of similar size {{to those of}} other large diurnal parrots. The broad-billed parrot was recorded on the dry leeward side of Mauritius, which was the most accessible for people, and it was noted that birds were more abundant near the coast, which may indicate that the fauna of such areas was more diverse. It may have nested in tree cavities or rocks, like the Cuban amazon. The terms raven or crow may have been suggested by the bird's harsh call, its behavioural traits, or just its dark plumage. The following description by Jacob Granaet from 1666 mentions some of the broad-billed parrot's co-inhabitants of the forests, and might indicate its demeanour: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{conservation}} of the kakapo {{has made the}} species well known. Many books and documentaries detailing {{the plight of the}} kakapo have been produced in recent years, one of the earliest being Two in the Bush, made by Gerald Durrell for the BBC in 1962. A feature-length documentary, The Unnatural History of the Kakapo won two major awards at the Reel Earth Environmental Film Festival. Two of the most significant documentaries, both made by NHNZ, are Kakapo – <b>Night</b> <b>Parrot</b> (1982) and To Save the kakapo (1997). The BBC's Natural History Unit also featured the kakapo, including a sequence with Sir David Attenborough in The Life of Birds. It {{was also one of the}} endangered animals Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine set out to find for the radio series and book Last Chance to See. An updated version of the series has been produced for BBC TV, in which Stephen Fry and Carwardine revisit the animals to see how they are getting on almost 20 years later, and in January 2009, they spent time filming the kakapo on Codfish Island. Footage of a kakapo named Sirocco attempting to mate with Carwardine's head was viewed by millions worldwide, leading to Sirocco becoming [...] "spokes-bird" [...] for New Zealand wildlife conservation in 2010, as part of the International Year of Biodiversity. The kakapo was featured in the episode [...] "Strange Islands" [...] of the documentary series South Pacific, originally aired on 13 June 2009, in the episode [...] "Worlds Apart" [...] of the series The Living Planet, and in episode 3 of the BBC's New Zealand Earth's Mythical Islands.|$|E
40|$|A {{population}} of <b>Night</b> <b>Parrots</b> (Pezoporus occidentalis) {{was discovered in}} 2013 in western Queensland and has become {{the primary focus of}} efforts aimed at conserving habitat and protecting the species from extinction. Critical information on nesting habitat and location, breeding season and behaviour, clutch size and breeding success is currently limited to anecdotal 19 th-century observations and accounts by early natural historians. Here we describe several breeding attempts at Pullen Pullen Reserve. Our observations include nest and fledgling descriptions, habitat and clutch characteristics, breeding seasonality, adult breeding behaviour and vocalisations. We also identify a King Brown Snake (Pseudechis australis) as the predator responsible for one nesting failure. Our observations confirm historical reports of nesting habitat, egg and clutch size and breeding seasonality and provide important new information on vocalisations and adult behaviour around an active nest. These new data provide a basis for future studies and conservation management of this enigmatic threatened species...|$|R

She agrees, and every night for the next seventy nights, she gets ready to meet him. But she is thwarted in her attempt every single <b>night</b> by the <b>parrot,</b> which adopts the stratagem of telling her a story. The parrot typically expresses approval of its mistress' intention by agreeing {{that the goal of}} life was to seek pleasure and acknowledges the strength of sexual desire. Then it excites her interest by asking whether she had the wits to escape if any troublesome situation were to arise, as the protagonist of her next story had. Padmavati naturally wants to know the details of the story and the parrot proceeds to narrate it. At the end of the story, Padmavati decides not to go for her rendezvous that night.|$|R

5000|$|Ornithologist John Gould {{described}} the <b>night</b> <b>parrot</b> in 1861, from a specimen—the holotype—that was collected 13 km southeast of Mt Farmer, west of Lake Austin in Western Australia. Its specific epithet is Latin occidentalis [...] "western". The species was originally placed {{within its own}} genus (Geopsittacus) by Gould, though consensus soon swung in favour of placing it in Pezoporus; James Murie dissected a specimen, observing {{that it was very}} similar in anatomy and plumage to the ground parrot. Gould had posited a relationship to the kakapo based on similarity of the plumage, however Murie concluded they were markedly different anatomically. Despite its close relationship with the ground parrot, its placement in the genus Pezoporus was uncertain, with some authorities leaving it in its own genus, as data on the <b>night</b> <b>parrot</b> was so limited. A 1994 molecular study using the cytochrome b of several parrot species confirmed the close relationship of the taxa and consensus for its placement in Pezoporus. It also revealed that the kakapo was not closely related to Pezoporus. Analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences in a 2011 study showed that the <b>night</b> <b>parrot</b> most likely diverged from the ancestor of the eastern and western ground parrots around 3.3 million years ago.|$|E
