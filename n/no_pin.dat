60|$|Clutching the bed-rail, Winifred {{reached up}} and turned the switch of the light hanging above her dressing-table. He {{appeared}} just {{on the rim of}} the light's circumference, emblazoned from the absence of his watch-chain down to boots neat and sooty brown, but--yes!--split at the toecap. His chest and face were shadowy. Surely he was thin--or was it a trick of the light? He advanced, lighted now from toe-cap to the top of his dark head--surely a little grizzled! His complexion had darkened, sallowed; his black moustache had lost boldness, become sardonic; there were lines which she did not know about his face. There was <b>no</b> <b>pin</b> in his tie. His suit--ah!--she knew that--but how unpressed, unglossy! She stared again at the toe-cap of his boot. Something big and relentless had been 'at him,' had turned and twisted, raked and scraped him. And she stayed, not speaking, motionless, staring at that crack across the toe.|$|E
60|$|To {{return to}} that early lie. They found <b>no</b> <b>pin</b> and they {{realised}} that another liar had {{been added to the}} world's supply. For by grace of a rare inspiration a quite commonplace but seldom noticed fact was borne in upon their understandings--that almost all lies are acts, and speech has no part in them. Then, if they examined a little further they recognised that all people are liars from the cradle onwards, without exception, and that they begin to lie as soon as they wake in the morning, and keep it up without rest or refreshment until they go to sleep at night. If they arrived at that truth it probably grieved them--did, if they had been heedlessly and ignorantly educated by their books and teachers; for why should a person grieve over a thing which by the eternal law of his make he cannot help? He didn't invent the law; it is merely his business to obey it and keep still; join the universal conspiracy and keep so still that he shall deceive his fellow-conspirators into imagining that he doesn't know that the law exists. It is what we all do--we that know. I am speaking of the lie of silent assertion; we can tell it without saying a word, and we all do it--we that know. In the magnitude of its territorial spread {{it is one of the}} most majestic lies that the civilisations make it their sacred and anxious care to guard and watch and propagate.|$|E
