5|$|In 2005, the Russian Federation {{had one of}} {{the highest}} levels of {{psychiatric}} beds per capita in Europe at 113.2 per 100,000 population, or more than 161,000 beds. In 2014, Russia has 104.8 beds per 100,000 population and no actions have been taken to arrange new facilities for outpatient services. Persons who do not respond well to treatment at dispensaries can be sent to long-term social care institutions (internats) wherein they remain indefinitely. The internats are managed by oblast Social Protection ministries. Russia had 442 psychoneurologic internats by 1999, and their number amounted to 505 by 2013. The internats provided places for approximately 125,000 people in 2007. In 2013, Russian psychoneurologic internats accommodated 146,000 people, according to the consolidated data of the Department of Social Protection of Moscow and the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Russian Federation. It is supposed that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> in internats is increasing at the same rate with which the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> is decreasing in psychiatric hospitals. Lyubov Vinogradova of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia provides the different figure of 122,091 or 85.5 places in psychoneurologic institutions of social protection (internats) per 100,000 population in 2013 and says that Russia is high on Europe's list of the number of places in the institutions. Vinogradova states that many regions have the catastrophic shortage of places in psychoneurological internats, her words point out to the need {{to increase the number of}} places there and to the fact that the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia is forcing transinstitutionalization—relocating the mentally ill from their homes and psychiatric hospitals to psychoneurological internats.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 the USSR had 70 {{psychiatric}} hospitals and 21,103 psychiatric beds. By 1935 this had increased to 102 {{psychiatric hospitals}} and 33,772 psychiatric beds, and by 1955 there were 200 psychiatric hospitals and 116,000 psychiatric {{beds in the}} Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities built psychiatric hospitals at a rapid pace and increased the quantity of beds for patients with nervous and mental illnesses: between 1962 and 1974 the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> for psychiatric patients increased from 222,600 to 390,000. Such an expansion {{in the number of}} psychiatric beds was expected to continue in the years up to 1980.

25|$|The Butterworth Hospital {{was founded}} by St. Mark's Church in 1873. The first {{patients}} were limited to elderly women, but two years later, a new facility opened to allow a more diverse patient load. By 1887 a need for further expansion led Richard E. Butterworth to offer the present site of Michigan Street and Bostwick Avenue. On April 26, 1890, the new facility opened, and it was renamed four years later in honor of Mr. Butterworth, who was not alive to see the opening. In the 1920s, the Butterworth family donated enough {{to open a new}} 220-bed facility at the hospital's current location. A further expansion in the early 1950s increased the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> to 425.

Kocher used this call, to demand certain improvements for the university clinic from the Bernese government. They accepted all his demands, the government promised him to begin building the new Inselspital building the next year, increased his credit for surgical equipment and books to 1000 franks and increased the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> for Kocher in the new Inselspital. Thus, Kocher decided to stay and many Bernese and Swiss students and professionals thanked him for it. He cited the affection of his students as one of his main reasons for staying.

25|$|The Ebola {{outbreak}}, {{which was}} the 26th outbreak since 1976, started in Guinea in March 2014. The WHO warned {{that the number of}} Ebola patients could rise to 20,000, and said that it used $489m (£294m) to contain Ebola within six to nine months. The outbreak was accelerating. Medecins sans Frontieres has just opened a new Ebola hospital in Monrovia, and after one week it is already a capacity of 120 patients. It said that the number of patients seeking treatment at its new Monrovia centre was increasing faster than they could handle both in terms of the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> and the capacity of the staff, adding that it was struggling to cope with the caseload in the Liberian capital. Lindis Hurum, MSF's emergency coordinator in Monrovia, said that it was humanitarian emergency and they needed a full-scale humanitarian response. Brice de la Vinge, MSF director of operations, said that it was not until five months after the declaration of the Ebola outbreak that serious discussions started about international leadership and coordination, and said that it was not acceptable.|$|E

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIIMPORTANCE In 1939, English mathematician, geneticist, and {{psychiatrist}} Lionel Sharples Penrose {{hypothesized that}} the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> psychiatric hospital <b>beds</b> and the sizes of prison populations were inversely related; 75 years later, the question arises {{as to whether the}} hypothesis applies to recent developments in South America. OBJECTIVE To explore the possible association of changes in the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> psychiatric hospital <b>beds</b> with changes in the sizes of prison populations in South America since 1990. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We searched primary sources for the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> psychiatric hospital <b>beds</b> in South American countries since 1990 (the year that the Latin American countries signed the Caracas Declaration) and compared these changes against the sizes of prison populations. The associations between the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> psychiatric <b>beds</b> and the sizes of prison populations were tested using fixed-effects regression of panel data. Economic variables were considered as covariates. Sufficiently reliable and complete data were obtained from 6 countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> psychiatric <b>beds</b> and the sizes of prison populations. RESULTS Since 1990, the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> psychiatric <b>beds</b> decreased in all 6 countries (ranging from - 2. 0 % to - 71. 9 %), while the sizes of prison populations increased substantially (ranging from 16. 1 % to 273. 0 %). Panel data regression analysis across the 6 countries showed a significant inverse relationship between <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> psychiatric <b>beds</b> and sizes <b>of</b> prison populations. On average, the removal <b>of</b> 1 <b>bed</b> was associated with 5. 18 more prisoners (95 % CI, 3. 10 - 7. 26; P =. 001), which was reduced to 2. 78 prisoners (95 % CI, 2. 59 - 2. 97; P <. 001) when economic growth was considered as a covariate. The association between the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> psychiatric <b>beds</b> and the sizes of prison populations remained practically unchanged when income inequality was considered as a covariate (- 4. 28 [95 % CI, - 5. 21 to - 3. 36]; P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Since 1990, the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> psychiatric <b>beds</b> have substantially decreased in South America, while the sizes of the prison populations have increased against a background of strong economic growth. The changes appear to be associated because the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> decreased more extensively when and where the sizes of prison populations increased. These findings are consistent with and specify the assumption of an association between the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> psychiatric <b>beds</b> and the sizes of prison populations.

The group is also collaborating with the Ministry of Health and Sanitation to inform the public of how to avoid contracting the disease. Among the other groups helping victims are Action Firm (AF) and the Sierra Leone Red Cross Society. AF provided free medical care for victims while about 400 volunteers of the Sierra Leone Red Cross helped out on sanitation awareness campaigns. Oxfam, a charity group based in the United Kingdom, is another group that provides nearly 67,000 people in Freetown with emergency water chlorination. Oxfam also plans to assist up to 500,000 people with cholera prevention kits, water purification kits and public information campaigns on how to prevent the disease. The Isle of Man donated to assist the activities in the country through Oxfam. The other British groups mobilised include Save the Children, International Rescue Committee, Concern, Care International and the British Red Cross. The Finnish Red Cross sent medication and doctors to the country on 24 and 25 August.

2500|$|The {{history of}} {{industry}} in the Black Country is connected directly to its underlying geology. Much of the region lies upon an exposed coalfield forming {{the southern part of}} the South Staffordshire Coalfield where mining has taken place since the Middle Ages. There are, in fact several coal seams, some of which were given names by the miners. The top, thin coal seam is known as Broach Coal. Beneath this lies successively the Thick Coal, Heathen Coal, Stinking Coal, Bottom Coal and Singing Coal seams. Other seams also exist. The Thick Coal seam was also known as the [...] "Thirty Foot" [...] or [...] "Ten Yard" [...] seam and is made up of a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> that have come together to form one thick seam. Interspersed with the coal seams are deposits of iron ore and fireclay. The Black Country coal field is bounded on the north by the Bentley Fault, to the north of which lies the Cannock Chase Coalfield. [...] Around the exposed coalfield, separated by geological faults, lies a concealed coalfield where the coal lies at much greater depth. A mine was sunk between 1870 and 1874 over the eastern boundary of the then known coal field in Smethwick and coal was discovered at a depth of over 400 yards. In the last decade of the 19th century, coal was discovered beyond the western boundary fault at Baggeridge at a depth of around 600 yards.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} levelling the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> required <b>beds</b> at the holding and recovery department. Due to the decreased <b>number</b> <b>of</b> available nurses, the workload for the nurses at hospitals has increased. For this reason, {{it is important}} to level the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> required <b>beds</b> at the holding and recovery department. By doing so, the workload can be reduced, beds will be available for emergency surgeries, less surgeries will be cancelled due to the lack <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> and less staff will be needed. The thesis starts with introducing an analytic calculation <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> required <b>beds</b> at the holding and recovery department. These calculations consider a stochastic length of stay (LOS) distribution for each surgery type. Making use of the analytic calculation and the stochastic length of stay, several solution methods are developed. The first solution method includes a formulation of the problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). The exact calculation <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> required <b>beds</b> is not linear, so the objective function is simplified. The ILP minimises the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> expected <b>beds.</b> The other solution methods uses the start and end times of each surgery. These start and end times are spread using two algorithms called Fixed Goal Values and Flexible Goal Values. Data from an Academic Medical Centre in the Netherlands is used to determine the LOS distributions and to find solutions for the ILP and the algorithms. This thesis shows that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> required <b>bed</b> at the holding and recovery department can be reduced...|$|R
