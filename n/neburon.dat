40|$|The {{ability of}} the soil fungus Rhizoctonia solani to degrade phenyl-substituted urea {{herbicides}} was investigated. The fungus was able to transform chlorbromuron [3 -(3 -chloro- 4 -bromophenyl) - 1 -methyl- 1 -methoxyurea] to the demethylated product [3 -(3 -chloro- 4 -bromophenyl) - 1 -methoxyurea], which was isolated and identified. Evidence was obtained that further degradation of chlorbromuron occurred. Several other phenylurea compounds (chloroxuron, diuron, fenuron, fluometuron, linuron, metobromuron, <b>neburon,</b> and siduron) were also metabolized by the fungus, indicating that R. solani may possess a generalized ability to attack this group of herbicides...|$|E
40|$|A molecularly {{imprinted}} polymer(MIP) {{was prepared}} with N-(4 -isopropylphenyl) -N'-butyleneurea as a template and MAA as a functional monomer and EDMA as a cross-linker. The affinities and selectivities of the MIP for phenylurea herbicides were studied. Among the fourteen phenylurea herbicides tested, the MIP prepared shows obviously high affinities and selectivities for ten chemicals (monuron, diuron, isoproturon, fenuron, chlortoluron, difenoxuron, metoxuron, <b>neburon,</b> buturon and fluometurion) with dichloromethane as the mobile phase while the non-imprinted polymer shows very low affinities {{for all the}} phenylurea herbicides tested. Recognition mechanism was also discussed. The results of the experiments and Mulliken atomic charges calculated indicate that the recognition site is mainly located at the N' position of phenylurea herbicides...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the feasibility of}} analyzing rapidly traces of polar and medium polar contaminants in soil by coupling on-line a hot phosphate-buffered water extraction apparatus to a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometer system. Coupling was accomplished by using a small C- 18 sorbent trap for collecting analytes and two six-port valves. The efficiency of this device was evaluated by extracting 13 selected pesticides from 200 mg of laboratory-aged soils by varying the extraction temperature, the extractant volume, and the now {{rate at which the}} extractant passed through the extraction cell and the sorbent trap. In terms of extraction efficiency, robustness of the method, and extraction time, the best compromise was that of using 8 mL of extractant at 90 degrees C and 0. 5 mL/min flow rate. Under these conditions, recoveries of 11 out of 13 analytes ranged between 82 and 103 %, while those of the least hydrophilic pesticides, i. e., <b>neburon</b> and prochloraz, were 73 and 63 %, respectively. By increasing the extractant volume to 60 mL, additional amounts of the two latter compounds could be recovered. Under this condition, however, the most hydrophilic analytes were in part no more retained by the C- 18 sorbent trap. From a naturally 1. 5 -year aged soil, hot phosphate-buffered water removed larger amounts of three herbicides and hydroxyterbuthylazine (a terbuthylazine degradation product) than pure water and Soxhlet extraction. This result seems to confirm that hot phosphate buffer is also able to remove from soil those fractions of contaminants that, on aging, are sequestered into the humic acid framework...|$|E
