Students will understand what is expected of them and teachers will know what they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> during the course. Clarity is important over years of schooling and when team teaching is involved. Each team member, or year in school, will have a clear understanding of {{what needs to be}} accomplished in each class, or at each level, allowing students to progress. Those designing and planning the curriculum are expected to work backwards once an outcome has been decided upon; they must determine what knowledge and skills will be required to reach the outcome.|$|E

40|$|The {{nature of}} the skills and competences needed by tutors {{teaching}} students at a distance has been approached {{in a number of}} different ways. What has received less attention are the particular skills and competences <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> languages at a distance. The paper will review the background literature, which served as a context for a project carried with tutors of the Open University in the UK to investigate this important and, so far, neglected area. While the skills and competences needed by tutors teaching languages were broadly similar <b>to</b> those <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> other subjects at a distance, there were marked differences between the skills <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> languages at a distance from those used in the classroom. The outcomes from this research can be regarded as relevant not just for distance language learning, but to language learning and distance education in general...|$|R

[...] "Do {{not talk}} but {{of what you}} know; do not think but {{of what you have}} {{materials}} to think justly upon; and do not look for things only that you like, when there are others to be seen"--this is the lesson to be taught to our youth, and inbred in them; and that mainly by our own example and continence. Never teach a child anything of which you are not yourself sure; and, above all, if you feel anxious to force anything into its mind in tender years, that the virtue of youth and early association may fasten it there, be sure it is no lie which you thus sanctify. There is always more to be taught of absolute, incontrovertible knowledge, open to its capacity, than any child can learn; there is no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> it anything doubtful. Better that it should be ignorant of a thousand truths, than have consecrated in its heart a single lie.|$|E

And when I am big and my people are big, and we have stamped the earth flat as far as men can travel, then I will remember your tribe--the tribe of the Langeni, who would not give me and my mother a cup of milk when we were weary. You see this gourd; for every drop it can hold the blood of a man shall flow--the blood of one of your men. But because you gave me the water I will spare you, Mopo, and you only, and make you great under me. You shall grow fat in my shadow.

60|$|The {{difference}} {{there is}} amongst {{men in their}} practical principles is so evident that I think I need say no more to evince, {{that it will be}} impossible to find any innate moral rules by this mark of general assent; and it is enough to make one suspect that the supposition of such innate principles is but an opinion taken up at pleasure; since those who talk so confidently of them are so sparing to tell us WHICH THEY ARE. This might with justice be expected from those men who lay stress upon this opinion; and it gives occasion to distrust either their knowledge or charity, who, declaring that God has imprinted on the minds of men the foundations of knowledge and the rules of living, are yet so little favourable to the information of their neighbours, or the quiet of mankind, as not to point out to them which they are, in the variety men are distracted with. But, in truth, were there any such innate principles there would be no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> them. Did men find such innate propositions stamped on their minds, they would easily be able to distinguish them from other truths that they afterwards learned and deduced from them; and there would be nothing more easy than to know what, and how many, they were. There could be no more doubt about their number than there is about the number of our fingers; and it is like then every system would be ready to give them us by tale. But since nobody, that I know, has ventured yet to give a catalogue of them, they cannot blame those who doubt of these innate principles; since even they who require men to believe that there are such innate propositions, do not tell us what they are. It is easy to foresee, that if different men of different sects should go about to give us a list of those innate practical principles, they would set down only such as suited their distinct hypotheses, and were fit to support the doctrines of their particular schools or churches; a plain evidence that there are no such innate truths. Nay, a great part of men are so far from finding any such innate moral principles in themselves, that, by denying freedom to mankind, and thereby making men no other than bare machines, they take away not only innate, but all moral rules whatsoever, and leave not a possibility to believe any such, to those who cannot conceive how anything can be capable of a law that is not a free agent. And upon that ground they must necessarily reject all principles of virtue, who cannot put MORALITY and MECHANISM together, which are not very easy to be reconciled or made consistent.|$|E

The two learning programs share a number of educational approaches driven by the learning objectives, the students’ development, and clinical realities. Common educational features include: experiential learning, the Biopsychosocial Model, patient-centered communication, integration into clinical clerkships, structured skill-based learning, self-reflection, and self-care. These shared features ― {{as well as some}} differences ― are explored in this paper in order to illustrate key issues in designing and implementing medical student education in these areas...|$|R
