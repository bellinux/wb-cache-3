5|$|In the {{subsequent}} off-season, Cloutier's remaining year {{on his contract}} was bought out by the Kings on June 21, 2008. As teams cannot buyout the contract of an injured player, Cloutier claimed he was <b>not</b> <b>healthy</b> and contested the move. However, the NHL ruled in favour of the Kings; the buyout stood and Cloutier became an unrestricted free agent. Consequently, he received $2 {{million over the next}} two years from the Kings.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Bryan {{announced}} on May 12 {{that due to}} injuries, he would require neck surgery, which he underwent on May 15. Bryan was stripped of the WWE World Heavyweight Championship by the Authority on June 9 as he was <b>not</b> <b>healthy</b> enough to defend his championship. Due to his injury, Bryan was largely removed from WWE television. John Cena's feud with Bray Wyatt culminated with a Last Man Standing at Payback on June 1, where Cena buried Wyatt under multiple equipment cases to win the match and end the feud. Cena won Bryan's vacated WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Money in the Bank on June 29. Brock Lesnar returned on July 21 and proceeded to decisively defeat Cena at SummerSlam to capture the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Affeldt {{was again}} {{expected}} to be the Royals' closer. However, he did not get a save opportunity until April 16 against Detroit, and he was unable to finish that game because of a groin injury that landed him on the disabled list again. After rehabbing in Omaha, Affeldt returned to the Royals on June 4. He was no longer the closer, however, because Mike MacDougal had been closing well in his absence. Affeldt was <b>not</b> <b>healthy</b> for long, as he returned to the disabled list on June 20 after reaggravating the groin injury.|$|E
5|$|The 1971–72 season brought several changes. Owner Jack Kent Cooke {{brought in}} Bill Sharman as head coach, and Elgin Baylor {{announced}} his retirement {{early in the season}} after realizing that his legs were <b>not</b> <b>healthy</b> enough. Sharman increased the team's discipline. He introduced the concept of the shootaround, where players would arrive at the arena early in the morning before a game to practice shots. They won 14 straight games in November and all 16 games played in December. They won three straight to open the year of 1972 but on January 9, the Milwaukee Bucks ended their winning streak by defeating the Lakers, 120–104. By winning 33 straight games, Los Angeles set a record for longest winning streak of any team in American professional sports. The Lakers won 69 games that season, which stood as the NBA record for 24 years until the Chicago Bulls won 72 games in 1995–96. Chamberlain averaged a low 14.8 points but led the league in rebounding at 19.2 a game. West's 9.7 assists per game (apg) led the league, he also averaged more than 25 points, and was named MVP of the 1972 NBA All-Star Game. The team failed to score 100 points just once all year, {{and at the end of}} the season, Bill Sharman was named Coach of the Year. The Lakers went on to reach the finals against the New York Knicks where they would avenge their 1970 finals loss by defeating them 4 games to 1. Chamberlain tallied 24 points and 29 rebounds in game five and won the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award.|$|E

25|$|Peter H. Russell, a {{professor}} emeritus {{of political science at}} the University of Toronto, suggested that if Harper had sought a dissolution, the governor general would have had to consider carefully the reasonableness of the request. In Russell's view, the viceroy's primary concern is to protect parliamentary democracy and a dissolution of parliament would have necessitated an election only two months after the preceding one; repeated short term elections are <b>not</b> <b>healthy</b> for the system. In such a case, with a reasonably viable coalition available, Jean might then refuse Harper's advice to dissolve parliament (forcing him to resign under constitutional precedent), and invite Dion to form a government.|$|E

[...] His parents ran a printing house in Glasgow, Crownpoint Publications, and occasionally had spare capacity: they were interested in using the idle time on their machinery to enter the publishing business, and Peter persuaded them to publish paperback science fiction (sf) novels. [...] Two novels were acquired, but when Crownpoint approached a local wholesaler to handle the distribution, they were told that paperbacks would be a mistake, and that a magazine, with a regular publication schedule, would be more likely to sell well. [...] The result was Nebula Science Fiction. [...] The first issue was dated Autumn 1952, and sold 4,000 copies.|$|E

500|$|Seydlitz became legendary {{throughout}} the Prussian Army both for his leadership {{and for his}} reckless courage. During the Seven Years' War, he came into his own as a cavalry general, known for his coup d'œil, his ability to assess at a glance the entire battlefield situation and to understand intuitively {{what needed to be}} done: he excelled at converting the King's directives into flexible tactics. At the Battle of Rossbach, his cavalry was instrumental in routing the French and Imperial armies. His cavalry subsequently {{played an important role in}} crushing the Habsburg and Imperial left flank at the Battle of Leuthen. Seydlitz was wounded in battle several times. After the Battle of Kunersdorf in August 1759, he semi-retired to recover from his wounds, charged with the protection of the city of Berlin.

500|$|Partially {{due to her}} {{experiences}} filming Mermaids, Cher turned down leading roles in such films as The War of the Roses and Thelma & Louise. According to Berman, [...] "After the success of Moonstruck, she was so worried about her next career move that she was overly cautious." [...] In the early 1990s, she contracted the Epstein–Barr virus and developed chronic fatigue syndrome, which left her too exhausted to sustain her music and film careers. Because she needed to earn money and was <b>not</b> <b>healthy</b> enough to work on other projects, she starred in infomercials launching health, beauty, and diet products, which earned her close to $10million in fees. The skits were parodied on Saturday Night Live and critics considered them a sellout, many suggesting her film career was over. She told Ladies' Home Journal, [...] "Suddenly I became the Infomercial Queen and it didn't occur to me that people would focus on that and strip me of all my other things." ...|$|E

[...] During the tour both experienced intense heroin withdrawal, with Slovak much more unstable than Kiedis. [...] His withdrawal symptoms took a toll on his ability to play his instrument; at one point Slovak had a mental breakdown and was unable to play a show, leaving the rest of the band to play an entire set with no guitar. [...] He recovered a few days later, but his bandmates felt he was <b>not</b> <b>healthy</b> enough to perform and replaced Slovak with DeWayne McKnight for a few shows. [...] After a few days with McKnight, the band decided to give Slovak another chance, and he rejoined for the European leg of the tour.
