2500|$|Wigwags {{manufactured}} by WRRS and its predecessors were once numerous in the Midwest, with almost every town {{using them to}} protect their main crossings. The most common model was called the Autoflag #5. They functioned {{in much the same}} way as the Magnetic Flagmen. They utilized alternating electromagnets to swing a shaft with an attached illuminated banner. Bells were not integral to the devices as with the Magnetic Flagmen. They employed standard bells that were used on other types of signals, and mounted either to the mast or to a bracket on the top of the center harp style, as in the Devil's Lake, WI photo. Autoflag #5s were widely used on the C, CB, Illinois Central, Soo Line and the Milwaukee Road. A few were also used on the Louisville & Nashville and the Gulf, Mobile & Ohio as well as other roads in the US and Canada. Most of these wigwags were removed in the 1970-1980s as crossings were updated. They were made in both a lower quadrant style and a center harp style similar to the Magnetic Flagman's peachbasket style. [...] Early on, there were Autoflag [...] #5s that would hold the banner behind a shield much like the Magnetic Flagman disappearing banner-style. [...] These were replaced as time went on with the standard two-position banner that hung vertically when <b>not</b> <b>energized.</b> [...] Several railroad, such as the GM and CB, had a second light below the main light on the banner. [...] This served as a second reserve light in case of failure of both bulbs in the main light and as a signal maintainers' warning of a burned out bulb without having to climb up and open the main light to check each bulb. [...] If the secondary light was illuminated, there was an issue with burned out bulbs in the main light.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} valve design variations. Ordinary valves can have many ports and fluid paths. A 2-way valve, for example, has 2 ports; if the valve is open, {{then the two}} ports are {{connected}} and fluid may flow between the ports; if the valve is closed, then ports are isolated. If the valve is open when the solenoid is <b>not</b> <b>energized,</b> then the valve is termed normally open (N.O.). Similarly, if the valve is closed when the solenoid is <b>not</b> <b>energized,</b> then the valve is termed normally closed. [...] There are also 3-way and more complicated designs. [...] A 3-way valve has 3 ports; it connects one port to {{either of the two}} other ports (typically a supply port and an exhaust port).|$|E

5000|$|Sources {{that produce}} direct current, such as solar panels must be {{coupled with an}} {{electrical}} inverter to convert the output to alternating current, for use with conventional appliances. The phase of the outgoing power must be synchronized with the grid, and a mechanism must be included to disconnect the feed {{in the event of}} grid failure. This is for safety for example, workers repairing downed power lines must be protected from [...] "downstream" [...] sources, in addition to being disconnected from the main [...] "upstream" [...] distribution grid. Note: A small generator simply lacks the power to energize a loaded line. This can only happen if the line is isolated from other loads, and is extremely unlikely. Solar inverters are designed for safety while one inverter could <b>not</b> <b>energize</b> a line, a thousand might. In addition, all electrical workers should treat every line as though it was live, even when they know it should be safe.|$|R

40|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} (AM) fungi benefit {{their host}} plants by supplying phosphate {{obtained from the}} soil. Polyphosphate is thought to act as the key intermediate in this process, but little is currently understood about how polyphosphate is synthesized or translocated within arbuscular mycorrhizas. Glomus sp. strain HR 1 was grown with marigold in a mesh bag compartment system, and extraradical hyphae were harvested and fractionated by density gradient centrifugation. Using this approach, three distinct layers were obtained: layers 1 and 2 were composed of amorphous and membranous materials, together with mitochondria, lipid bodies, and electron-opaque bodies, and layer 3 was composed mainly of partially broken hyphae and fragmented cell walls. The polyphosphate kinase/luciferase system, a highly sensitive polyphosphate detection method, enabled the detection of polyphosphate-synthesizing activity in layer 2 {{in the presence of}} ATP. This activity was inhibited by vanadate but not by bafilomycin A 1 or a protonophore, suggesting that ATP may <b>not</b> <b>energize</b> the reaction through H+-ATPase but may act as a direct substrate in the reaction. This report represents the first demonstration that AM fungi possess polyphosphate-synthesizing activity that is localized in the organelle fraction and not in the cytosol or at the plasma membrane...|$|R

5000|$|The FS uses a spool system {{similar to}} an Automag, {{but instead of}} {{incorporating}} a shut-off valve, and using a sear/spring arrangement to return the bolt from its blow-forward operation, it uses air pressure. The system has full-pressure supply air stored in a dump chamber {{in the rear of}} the marker. This pressure is applied to the center pin {{in the rear of the}} bolt, which is biased to push it open. The regulated air supplied by a front Low Pressure Regulator (LPR) is run through a 2/3-way solenoid valve that is designed to be [...] "Normally On" [...] when it is <b>not</b> <b>energized.</b> This lower pressure air is supplied to the front of the bolt, and the regulator is adjusted to supply enough force to push the bolt back against the supply pressure.|$|E

40|$|The MotorDriverV 1. 0 {{board is}} a {{high-power}} dual H-bridge capable of independently driving 2 DC motors or one stepper motor. The driver {{is based on}} the LMD 18200 H-bridge IC from National Semiconductor and can operate at supply voltages of 12 volts to 50 volts, and motor currents up to 3 amps continuous and 6 amps peak. Pulse width modulation (PWM) can be used to achieve variable motor speeds and powers. An electro-motive brake function is available and when activated will slow motor rotation by electronically shorting the motor leads. Each motor driver accepts three logic-level (0 - 5 V) control signals: PWM, DIR, and BRAKE. The PWM input controls the power applied to the motor. The DIR input controls the polarity of the applied output and hence the direction of rotation for a DC motor. The BRAKE allows the motor to be slowed by shorting the motor’s induced field. Each motor driver outputs two signals: ISENSE and TFLAG. ISENSE is an analog voltage representing the current being delivered to the motor at any given time. The scale of this voltage is (377 uA/A* 4. 7 K) = 1. 77 V/A (that’s 1. 77 volts output for every amp of motor current). Also available is a TFLAG output indicating when the case temperature of the motor driver chip exceeds 145 ºC. Connection is made to all control and monitoring signals via three 10 -pin headers. These headers are designed to be highly compatible with the AVRmini development board, Atmel's STK 500, as well as being suitable for general-purpose use. NOTE: The LMD 18200 driver requires a minimum of ~ 10 V to operate. At supply voltages less than 10 V, the driver outputs do <b>not</b> <b>energize...</b>|$|R
50|$|Low Voltage {{propulsion}} {{control was}} coming into style {{around the time}} the earliest Standards were being delivered. Therefore, {{it was no surprise}} the Standards arrived with the feature. On earlier high voltage propulsion control systems, 600 volts ran through the motorman's control stand as well as through the train via the use of jumpers between cars. This had to be the case to make the electrical contacts to allow all of the motor cars of a train to draw power in a synchronized effort from the Third rail. However, this could be dangerous for motormen and shop personnel alike by creating an electrocution hazard. Even unpowered trailer cars had to carry the 600 volts through these jumpers, because it was necessary to pass on the voltage to motor cars behind the trailer so as to synchronize them with the lead car. However, low voltage propulsion control utilized battery voltage (32 volts) to control the train's motors. This battery voltage was what would pass through the motorman's control stand and between cars. Tractive effort throughout the train was synchronized by the battery voltage in this way. Meanwhile, each car would respond individually to the battery voltage, by moving its own 600 volt contacts to direct power obtained locally by each car directly from the third rail toward the motors. Using 32 volts to control the propulsion in this way was a much safer proposition than the 600 volts associated with the older high voltage setup. This also meant that Standards crossing onto a dead section of third rail would <b>not</b> <b>energize</b> it by bridging the gap between it and the previous live section. This was especially beneficial to track workers who had requested third rail power off in performing their duties. All told, Low Voltage propulsion control tremendously improved safety for train crews, shop crews, and track gangs.|$|R

When the electromagnet is <b>not</b> <b>energized,</b> the mouse acts normally, with the same low friction and only {{a slight increase in}} mass. Energizing the electromagnet attracts the mouse towards a ferromagnetic mouse pad, increasing the normal force, and thus the frictional force, between the mouse and the mouse pad. This allows a two-dimensional display of varying frictional forces. Our hypothesis was that an increase in friction over particular targets could enable the user to travel more quickly between those targets. In addition to several demonstrations, we designed a performance experiment to quantitatively determine how user performance is affected by friction feedback during a targeting task.

40|$|A {{major portion}} of {{tetracycline}} accumulation by susceptible bacterial cells is energy dependent. Inner membrane vesicles prepared from susceptible Escherichia coli cells concentrated tetracycline 2. 5 to 5 times above the external concentration when the electron transport substrate D-lactate or reduced phenazine methosulfate was added.

These vesicles data showed that proton motive force alone could energize tetracycline uptake. The lactate-dependent uptake had a pH optimum of 6. 9 and a magnesium optimum of 1 mM and was not saturable up to 400 microM tetracycline. Although the vesicles were not as active as cells in concentrating tetracycline, they were less active to a similar extent in concentrating tetracycline, they were less active to a similar extent in concentrating proline, the transport of which {{is known to be}} solely proton motive force dependent.
