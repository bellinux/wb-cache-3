30|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{properties of}} the <b>Ni</b> <b>catalysts,</b> such as catalytic activity and distinctive magnetic property, are deeply affected by their size, crystallinity, composition, and morphology [28 – 32]. Extensive efforts [33 – 40] have been devoted to fabricate various structures of porous <b>Ni</b> <b>catalysts,</b> making use of template synthesis, self-assembly, electro/chemical bath deposition, sol-gel method, and so on. The traditional RANEY® Ni, {{one of the most}} widely used <b>Ni</b> <b>catalysts</b> in industry, is prepared by chemical leaching and consists essentially of a porous skeletal structure exhibiting high catalytic activity. However, the fine powder nature of RANEY® Ni results in difficult catalyst separation from liquid phase reactions or plugging and pressure build-up in the fixed bed systems [41 – 45]. Recently, Fow’s group [46 – 48] prepared gauze-supported skeletal <b>Ni</b> <b>catalysts</b> which may be adapted to various reactor configurations by folding or stacking.

For free standing <b>Ni</b> <b>catalysts,</b> Wu’s group [49] demonstrated a facile template- and surfactant-free method to prepare porous hierarchical Ni nanostructures by directly calcining the Ni-based flower-like precursor in Ar. Zhu et al. [50] developed a novel precursor hydrothermal redox method to fabricate the hierarchically porous structure of Ni hollow microspheres consisting of Ni nanoparticles on the shell. Yuan et al. [40] self-assembled synthesized porous Ni phosphate/phosphonate hybrid microspheres to combine the merits of organic and inorganic components. The hybrids showed catalytic activity for the reduction of 4 -nitrophenol (4 -NP) to 4 -aminophenol (4 -AP) due to the presence of Ni active sites on the pore surface. However, the Ni nanostructures produced from these soft-templating or template-free approaches were typically not uniform due to the undirected nucleation sites in the homogenous system.|$|R
