30|$|The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) {{has issued}} four {{documents}} dealing with performance measurements of <b>nuclear</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>equipment.</b> These are gamma camera’s (NU 1), PET scanners (NU 2), non-imaging intra-operative gamma probes (NU 3) and small-animal PET scanners (NU 4) [5].

They are consensus documents, which implies that ‘the information in the publication was considered technically sound by the consensus of persons engaged {{in the development and}} approval of the document {{at the time it was}} developed’.

40|$|With {{the sophistication}} and {{increased}} use of scintillation cameras in nuclear medicine, routine quality assurance procedures are needed to insure a consistent and acceptable level of performance. A set of simple protocols has been developed to facilitate use of these procedures in a daily quality assurance program. To implement application of the protocols, a workshop on quality assurance for scintillation cameras has been developed for presentation to clinical nuclear medicine personnel. The Scintillation Camera Quality Assurance Work-shop has been presented in eight locations, and information for the presentation of a workshop is available for nationwide distribution. In nuclear medicine, the interpretation of static images and dynamic function studies often depends critically {{on the quality of}} the images and data furnished by the equipment and techniques used. This critical dependence exists because abnormal conditions in the patient frequently are manifested as subtle changes in the images and data that are barely above the threshold of detectability. Sub-optimal equipment and techniques may cause these subtle changes to fall below the threshold of detectability and therefore pass unnoticed by the physician. For this reason, it is essential that <b>nuclear</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>equipment</b> and procedures be maintained at an acceptable level of performance at all times. To achieve this objective, a continuous program of quality assurance is needed in each medical institution with nuclear medicine facilities. Various advisory and regulatory agencies for nuclear medicine services have recognized the importance of quality assurance procedures in nuclear medicine by requiring that adequate testing procedures be performed and recorded regularly as conditions for accreditation and licensure. For example, the Joint Commission o...|$|E
40|$|Objective: <b>Nuclear</b> <b>medicine</b> is {{becoming}} increasingly important in the early detection of malignancy. The advantage of <b>nuclear</b> <b>medicine</b> over other imaging modalities is the high sensitivity of the gamma camera. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>medicine</b> counting <b>equipment</b> has the capability of detecting levels of radioactivity which exceed background levels by as little as 2. 4 to 1. This translates to {{only a few hundred}} counts per minute on a regular gamma camera or as few as 3 counts per minute when using coincidence detection on a positron emission tomography (PET) camera. Material and Methods: We have experimentally measured the limits of detectability using a set of hollow spheres in a Jaszczak phantom at various tumor-to-background ratios. Imaging modalities for this work were (1) planar, (2) SPECT, (3) PET, and (4) planar camera with coincidence detection capability (MCD). Results: When there is no background (infinite contrast) activity present, the detectability of tumors is similar for PET and planar imaging. With the presence of the background activity, PET can detect objects in an order of magnitude smaller in size than that can be seen by conventional planar imaging especially in the typical clinical low (3 : 1) T/B ratios. The detection capability of the MCD camera lies between a conventional <b>nuclear</b> <b>medicine</b> (planar / SPECT) scans and the detection capability of a dedicated PET scanner Conclusion: Among <b>nuclear</b> <b>medicine’s</b> armamentarium, PET is the closest modality to CT or MR imaging in terms of limits of detection. Modern clinical PET scanners have a resolution limit of 4 mm, corresponding to the detection of tumors with a volume o...|$|R
40|$|<b>Nuclear</b> <b>medicine</b> methods {{permit the}} in vivo {{measurement}} of physiological and metabolic functions. For this purpose metabolically active molecules are labelled with radionuclides. After the injection, these radiopharmaceuticals {{can be detected}} from outside the body with appropriate detectors such as conventional gamma cameras, single photon emission computerized tomographs (SPECT), or positron emission tomographs (PET). As with any application of ionizing radiation the benefits of <b>nuclear</b> <b>medicine</b> (the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} disease) must be balanced against the risks of the procedures. Risks in <b>nuclear</b> <b>medicine</b> are evaluated through dosimetry, the calculation of the radiation dose estimates, in which the energy deposited by the radiation in human tissues is quantitated. The first step of dosimetry is the determination of the biodistribution, i. e. the spatial and temporal distribution of the radiopharmaceutical within the body. When a new radiopharmaceutical is introduced such data are first derived from ex vivo experiments in animals. Further evaluations of the biokinetics and dosimetry are carried out via quantitative measurements in humans using the <b>nuclear</b> <b>medicine</b> imaging <b>equipment,</b> applying whole-body planar and tomographic methods. Based on the knowledge of the biodistribution and using the framework introduced by the MIRD committee {{as well as by the}} ICRP, the radiation dose to single organs and to the total body can be calculated. The purpose of this paper is to review methods for measuring radiopharmaceutical biodistributions in humans and for calculating the appropriate radiation dose quantities...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The {{impact on}} patients’ health of radiopharmaceuticals in <b>nuclear</b> <b>medicine</b> {{diagnostics}} has not until now been evaluated systematically in a European context. Therefore, {{as part of}} the EU-funded Project PEDDOSE. NET (www. peddose. net), we review and summarize the current knowledge on biokinetics and dosimetry of commonly used diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals. Methods A detailed literature search on published biokinetic and dosimetric data was performed mostly via PubMed (www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/pubmed). In principle the criteria for inclusion of data followed the EANM Dosimetry Committee guidance document on good clinical reporting. Results Data on dosimetry and biokinetics can be difficult to find, are scattered in various journals and, especially in paediatric <b>nuclear</b> <b>medicine,</b> are very scarce. The data collection and calculation methods vary with respect to the time-points, bladder voiding, dose assessment after the last data point and the way the effective dose was calculated. In many studies the number of subjects included for obtaining biokinetic and dosimetry data was fewer than ten, and some of the biokinetic data were acquired more than 20 years ago. Conclusion It would be of interest to generate new data on biokinetics and dosimetry in diagnostic <b>nuclear</b> <b>medicine</b> using state-of-the-art <b>equipment</b> and more uniform dosimetry protocols. For easier public access to dosimetry data for diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, a database containing these data should be created and maintained...|$|R
