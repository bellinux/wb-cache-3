There are additional restraining forces applied by the vehicle suspension and, at high speed, the wheel set will generate additional gyroscopic torques, which will modify the estimate of the critical speed. Conventionally a railway vehicle has stable motion in low speeds, when it reaches to high speeds stability changes to unstable form. The main purpose of <b>nonlinear</b> <b>analysis</b> of rail vehicle system dynamics is to show the view of analytical investigation of bifurcation, nonlinear lateral stability and hunting behavior of rail vehicles in a tangent track.

40|$|Abstract. The {{tolerance}} {{analysis methods}} are usually {{used to test}} the result of product design and assembly; moreover the tolerance analysis also is a fundamental technique in precision design process. So far, {{there are two kinds of}} tolerance analysis methods: statistical tolerance analysis and worst-case analysis; they have their own characteristics and drawbacks. In this paper, it presents a <b>nonlinear</b> tolerance <b>analysis</b> method which uses Matlab tool to construct the <b>nonlinear</b> tolerance <b>analysis</b> mathematical formulation and calculate the result of <b>nonlinear</b> tolerance <b>analysis</b> based on the principle of worst-case tolerance analysis. All the processes are dealt with and tested by computer. The engineers only enter some basic parameters through the standardized interface, and then the result can be obtained without artificial intervention. In addition, the accuracy of calculation result meets the production requirement. The system of the <b>nonlinear</b> tolerance <b>analysis</b> is easier for engineers to use...|$|R
