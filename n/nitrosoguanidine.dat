Analogs of nucleotides and other chemicals were first {{used to generate}} localized point mutations. Such chemicals include aminopurine, which induces AT to GC transition, while <b>nitrosoguanidine,</b> bisulfite, and N4-hydroxycytidine may induce GC to AT transition. [...] These techniques allow specific mutations to be engineered into a protein; however, they are not flexible {{with respect to the}} kinds of mutants generated, nor are they as specific as later methods of site-directed mutagenesis and therefore have some degree of randomness. Current techniques for site-specific mutation commonly involve using mutagenic oligonucleotides in a primer extension reaction with DNA polymerase. This methods allows for point mutation, or deletion or insertion of small stretches of DNA to be introduced at specific sites. Advances in methodology have made such mutagenesis now a relatively simple and efficient process.|$|E
5000|$|Feldman used <b>nitrosoguanidine</b> as a mutagen {{and used}} race tubes to screen {{individual}} strains surviving the mutagenesis for their circadian period length. Race tubes are long hollow glass tubes bent {{at either end}} to hold an agar growth medium. When Neurospora is inoculated {{at one end of}} a tube it will grow to the other end, and in constant darkness the daily circadian cycle of growth and development is manifest. [...] Although Feldman's screens were successful he was slow to publish so the identity of mutant genes frq1, frq2, and frq3 were not reported until 1973. [...] In 1986, frq was cloned by Jay Dunlap and his colleagues using a strategy that involved a long chromosome walk and successful application of the then-untried strategy of rescuing an arrhythmic behavioral mutant through transformation of exogenous DNA arising from the chromosome walk. The success of this strategy and of the cloning of a clock gene sparked interest in further research and understanding of the N. crassa circadian clock. [...] The expression of frq was later shown to rhythmically cycle; furthermore, when strains of Neurospora were engineered in which frq expression could be driven from a region distinct from the resident wild type gene, it was found that FRQ repressed its own expression and that no level of constant expression could support a circadian clock. These experiments were the first to manipulate the expression of a clock gene through means that did not themselves affect the clock and established that autoregulatory negative feedback giving rise to cyclical clock gene expression lay {{at the core of the}} circadian oscillator.|$|E
40|$|N-methyi-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (<b>nitrosoguanidine)</b> and to {{a lesser}} extent UV {{radiation}} are very mutagenic for Gibberella microconidia. The recommended <b>nitrosoguanidine</b> doses lead to much higher frequencies of mutants than are found in other microorganisms. The frequency of mutants among the survivors increases linearly with the <b>nitrosoguanidine</b> dose (molar concentration x time); the absolute number of viable mutants in a given population reaches a maximum for a dose of ca. O. 7 M · s. The microconidia are uninucleate. The onset of germination brings about increased lethality of <b>nitrosoguanidine,</b> but it does not modify the action of UV radiation. Mycelia are more resistaót than spores to both agents. Visible Ulumination eft'ectively prevents lethality when given immediately alter UV irradiation.

40|$|The UV {{survival}} {{curves of}} different strains of myxobacteria exhibited shoulders; {{in the case}} of Polyangium luteum, an unusual double shoulder appeared. Repair inhibitors like acriflavine, caffeine, and coumarin reduced the survival of UV-irradiated cells if the drugs were incorporated in the post-irradiation plating medium. The shoulders were reduced, but the final inactivation slopes were not affected by the repair inhibitors. Those strains that were resistant to UV were also more resistant to being killed by <b>nitrosoguanidine.</b> A variety of drug-resistant mutants occurred. The spontaneous mutation frequencies to drug resistance varied with the drug and the strain used. Drug-resistant mutants were inducible by UV irradiation and <b>nitrosoguanidine.</b> The UV mutability of Myxococcus xanthus was high compared to Cystobacter sp. However, the <b>nitrosoguanidine</b> mutability of M. xanthus was low compared to the other strains...|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between DNA replication {{and the action}} of the mutagen N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitroso-guanidine has been studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The frequenceis of reversion to prototrophy of six auxotrophic markers located along one arm of chromosome VII were examined {{as a function of the}} vegetative cell cycle. Exponentially growing cells were treated with <b>nitrosoguanidine</b> and then separated by zonal rotor centrifugation into fractions equivalent to stages in the cell cycle. The frequency of reversion for five of the six markers is greatest during the period of DNA replication. Each marker has a single point of maximum reversion, approximately 10 -fold greater than the frequency observed at other points in the cell cycle. For any one marker the effect of <b>nitrosoguanidine</b> is restricted to an interval shorter than the period of DNA replication. The two markers most distant from each other, ade 5 and leul, both have their highest reversion frequency early during DNA replication. The peak reversion frequency for lys 5 is somewhat later, while the peaks for tyr 3 and trp 5 occur near the end of DNA replication. The results indicate that <b>nitrosoguanidine</b> acts primarily during DNA replication and that different markers appear to be affected at different intervals during the DNA biosynthetic period. If <b>nitrosoguanidine</b> does act at the growing point of DNA replication, these observations indicate that the initiation of DNA replication occurs at specific times during the period of DNA synthesis and at specific initiation sites. Further, there must be more than one point of initiation of DNA replication on one arm of chromosome VII...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} mutagens on three genetic markers [...] {{resistance}} to ouabain, 6 -thioguanine, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt 2 cAMP), were investigated in a mouse lymphoma cell line, S 49. <b>Nitrosoguanidine,</b> ethyl methanesulfonate, ICR 191, and x-rays were used. Mutagen-specific responses were seen. Ouabain resistance was induced by <b>nitrosoguanidine,</b> {{but not by}} ICR 191. ICR 191 induced resistance to 6 -thioguanine more efficiently than did nitrosoguanidine; the converse was true of resistance to Bt 2 cAMP. The relative frequency of biochemically distinguishable subtypes of mutants resistant to Bt 2 cAMP was characteristic of the mutagen used to generate them. The results {{can be interpreted as}} follows: <b>nitrosoguanidine</b> and ethyl methanesulfonate frequently, but ICR 191 and x-rays rarely, give rise to DNA base sequence changes that result in structurally altered but functional proteins. This type of change is required for induction of mutants resistant to ouabain and of certain classes of mutants resistant to Bt 2 cAMP. Resistance to 6 -thioguanine and other classes of mutants resistant to Bt 2 cAMP can result from DNA base sequence changes that lead to extensive alteration of protein structure or expression; these changes are induced by ICR 191 or x-rays...|$|E

40|$|Both the {{acridine}} half-mustard, ICR 191, and the nonalkylating azaacridine derivative, ICR 364 -OH, induce {{three classes}} of frameshift mutations in the histidine operon of Salmonella typhimurium. (i) One class is completely stable in reversion tests and {{is presumed to}} represent deletion of {{one or a few}} critical nucleotide pairs or two nearby frameshifts. One extended deletion was found out of 11 stable mutations. (ii) Of two spontaneously reverting classes which also are considered to predominantly involve base deletions, one is unaffected in reversion with ICR 191, <b>nitrosoguanidine,</b> and diethylsulfate, and the other is induced to revert with ICR 191. (iii) A third class, considered to predominantly involve base additions, responds in reversion tests with ICR 191 as well as with <b>nitrosoguanidine</b> and diethylsulfate. Other investigators have shown that one mutant of this class is a “plus” frameshift and that <b>nitrosoguanidine</b> acts in reversion to delete a guanine plus cytosine base pair. Although such plus frameshifts are found with high frequency among mutations selected from acridine-treated bacteria or when strong selection pressure is applied for their detection in reversion tests, data from this laboratory indicate that this class of plus frameshifts is rare among mutations derived spontaneously or after treatment with a variety of other mutagens. Finally, we demonstrate that the alkylating ICR 191 and the nonalkylating ICR 364 -OH preferentially cause mutations in different chromosome regions and that their spectra of activity only partially overlap that found for spontaneous frameshift mutations...|$|E

Bibliography: leaves [97]- 101. viii, 101 l illusInactivation {{studies on}} Anacystis nidulans were {{performed}} using UV irradiation and <b>nitrosoguanidine.</b> UV irradiation {{had no effect}} when the treated culture was first incubated in the light. When the UV irradiated culture was first incubated {{in the dark for}} 9 hours, an exponential survival curve was obtained with slope k= 0. 23 log S/So ergs•cm. The photoreactivable sector was calculated to be one. A slight shoulder in the survival curve was observed. Extrapolation of the asymptote to the y-axis indicated a target number of 2. The response to <b>nitrosoguanidine</b> was found to be concentration dependant. Mutation experiments were conducted mainly with <b>nitrosoguanidine.</b> A variety of mutant phenotypes was found upon induction with <b>nitrosoguanidine</b> treatment. These were minute colony formers (mcf), filamentous forms (snakes or sna), yellow (yel) and blue (blu), polymixin B (pmb) and kanamycin (kan) resistance. The frequencies of occurrence were: 3. 7 x 10 ^- 3 (mcf), 1. 0 x 10 ^- 3 (sna), 1. 8 x 10 ^- 3 (yel), 2. 98 x 10 ^- 3 (blu) and 4. 8 x 10 ^- 4 (pmbr). Auxotrophic mutants were not recovered even after screening approximately 8. 0 x 10 ^ 4 surviving colonies with the replica plate method. Cell synchrony was induced by a light-dark regimen. The rates of macromolecular synthesis of the synchronous culture were determined. Protein, RNA, and phospholipid fractions increased exponentially. DNA synthesis was periodic. An abrupt increase in the rate of DNA synthesis was seen at 3 hours prior to the cell division periods. The period of DNA synthesis was 6 to 7 hours. The times of abrupt increases in the rate of DNA synthesis were inferred to be the times of initiation of genome at a fixed point of replication. A genetic map was constructed by taking advantage of cyclic DNA synthesis of synchronously dividing cells. Sequential mutagenesis during the period of DNA synthesis yielded unique temporal patterns for specific marker frequencies. The patterns showed an initial plateau, an abrupt increase, then, a second plateau. Slopes of the abrupt increases were calculated. The times of the abrupt increases were then designated as the times of the replication of the cistrons and, correspondingly, the loci of the markers in time units. The loci of six markers were presented as the genetic map of Anacystis nidulans. These were pmbr, blu, yel, sna, mcf, and kanr in that temporal order...|$|E
