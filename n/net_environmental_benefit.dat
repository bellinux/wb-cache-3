40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{discusses}} <b>Net</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Benefit</b> Analysis for {{oil spill}} response, from an ecological point of view. This involves the weighing up of {{advantages and disadvantages}} of various spill responses to the flora and fauna and their habitats, compared with no response. Particular attention is paid to nearshore dispersant spraying and shore cleanup; and the scientific case history and experimental evidence which can be brought to bear on these responses is reviewed. For shoreline cleanup, consideration is given both to the shore itself, and to potentially interacting systems which could be affected in various ways depending upon the spill response (e. g. a bird colony or nearshore aquaculture facilities). It is concluded that for some scenarios, nearshore dispersant spraying can offer a <b>net</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>benefit.</b> For most cases of shore oiling, there is little ecological justification for any form of cleanup if only the shore itself is considered, but moderate cleanup carried out for the sake of interacting systems is acceptable.

40|$|This paper evaluates {{a set of}} {{contrail}} reduction strategies {{based on}} environmental and operational costs. A linear climate model was first used to convert climate effects of carbon dioxide emissions and aircraft contrails to changes in Absolute Global Temperature Potential, a metric that measures the mean surface temperature change due to aircraft emissions and persistent contrail formations. The concept of social cost of carbon and the carbon auction price from recent California's cap-and-trade system were then used to relate the carbon dioxide emissions and contrail formations to an environmental cost index. The strategy for contrail reduction is based on minimizing contrail formations by altering the aircraft's cruising altitude. The strategy uses a user-defined factor to trade off between contrail reduction and additional fuel burn and carbon dioxide emissions. A higher value of tradeoff factor results in more contrail reduction but also more fuel burn and carbon emissions. The strategy is considered favorable when the net environmental cost benefit exceeds the operational cost. The results show how the <b>net</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>benefit</b> varies with different decision-making time-horizon and different carbon cost. The cost models provide a guidance to select the trade-off factor {{that will result in}} the most <b>net</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>benefit...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{environmental}} benefits and burdens of phosphorus recovery in four centralized and two decentralized municipal wastewater systems were compared using {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA). In centralized systems, phosphorus recovered as struvite from the solids dewatering liquid resulted in an environmental benefit except for the terrestrial ecotoxicity and freshwater eutrophication impact categories, with power and chemical use offset by operational savings and avoided fertilizer production. Chemical-based phosphorus recovery, however, generally required more resources than were offset by avoided fertilizers, resulting in a net environmental burden. In decentralized systems, phosphorus recovery via urine source separation reduced the global warming and ozone depletion potentials but increased terrestrial ecotoxicity and salinization potentials due to application of untreated urine to land. Overall, mineral depletion and eutrophication are well-documented arguments for phosphorus recovery; however, phosphorus recovery does not necessarily present a <b>net</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>benefit.</b> While avoided fertilizer production does reduce potential impacts, phosphorus recovery does not necessarily offset the resources consumed in the process.

In the context of hydrologic risk management, Best Management Practices (BMPs) are compensatory techniques in urban drainage based on physical processes for the temporary storage or infiltration of stormwater. The environmental burdens taking place in the different life-cycle stages of a service, i. e., raw materials extraction, construction, transportation, use and maintenance and end-of-life can be estimated, analysed and discussed following the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. The objective {{of this study is to}} apply LCA to quantify the environmental impacts of the implementation of new flood prevention systems, based on the BMPs. In this case, the infiltration system consists of a grass filter, swale and infiltration trench (FST) located in São Carlos (São Paulo, Brazil).

40|$|In the UK, 87 % of {{dwellings}} and 60 % of non-domestic {{buildings that}} will be standing in 2050 have already been built. Therefore, the greatest energy savings and emissions reductions will be achieved through retrofit of existing buildings. This usually involves decision-making processes targeted at reducing operational energy consumption and maintenance bills. For this reason, retrofit decisions by building stakeholders are typically driven by financial considerations. However, recent trends towards environmentally conscious design and retrofit {{have focused on the}} environmental merits of these options, emphasising a lifecycle approach to emissions reduction. Building stakeholders cannot easily quantify and compare the sustainability impacts of retrofit options since they lack the resources to perform an effective decision analysis.

40|$|Executive summary The {{potential}} {{economic benefits}} of peak load demand management (DM) are widely recognised. However, the environmental implications are unclear. This discussion paper {{is a first step}} towards clarifying the environmental benefits and costs of DM measures as they apply to Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM). Demand management (DM) activities can provide environmental benefits where load shifted from periods of peak demand is supplied by cleaner, more modern and more efficient baseload generators. DM will also have a <b>net</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>benefit</b> if it displaces spinning reserves from coal- and gas-fired power stations, since they produce emissions without generating energy. In the long term, DM appears to be important as an enabler of other technologies that will lead to a cleaner energy system, i. e. renewable energy technologies and electrical vehicles, as it helps to balance out intermittency. DM may result in a reduction in total energy usage (load shedding rather than shifting), which provides clear environmental benefit. This effect is likely to be weaker with industrial users, as they will generally need to use the same level of energy at a different time, and stronger with residential consumers, who appear less likely to make up for foregone energy later. Businesses may also forego energy usage in certain situations...|$|E

Aviation operations affect the environment mainly through the release of emis-sions and by the formation of contrails. Recent {{research has shown that}} altering aircraft cruise altitudes can reduce aviation environmental impact by reducing Absolute Global Temperature Change Potential, a climate assessment metric that adapts a linear system for modeling the global temperature response to aviation emissions and contrails. However, these methods will increase fuel consumption that leads to higher operational costs imposed on airlines resulting in reluctance to adopt a new routing strategy. This paper evaluates the tradeoff between environmental impact reduction and the corresponding added operational costs for enroute air traffic.

A transition in WWTPs toward reuse of wastewater-derived resources is recognized as a promising solution for overcoming these obstacles. However, it remains uncertain whether this approach can reduce the environmental footprint of WWTPs. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a <b>net</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>benefit</b> calculation for several scenarios for more than 50 individual countries over a 20 -y time frame. For developed countries, the resource recovery approach resulted in similar to 154 % net increase in the environmental performance of WWTPs compared with the traditional substance elimination approach, whereas this value decreased to similar to 60 % for developing countries. Subsequently, we conducted a probabilistic analysis integrating these estimates with national values and determined that, if this transition was attempted for WWTPs in developed countries, {{it would have a}} similar to 65 % probability of attaining net environmental benefits. However, this estimate decreased greatly to similar to 10 % for developing countries, implying a substantial risk of failure. These results suggest that implementation of this transition for WWTPs should be studied carefully in different temporal and spatial contexts. Developing countries should customize their approach to realizing more sustainable WWTPs, rather than attempting to simply replicate the successful models of developed countries.

40|$|Master's thesis in Environmental {{technology}} : offshore engineeringThe initial {{appearance of}} dispersants was 1960 s and 1970 s; oil spill dispersants {{have been the}} topic of significant research, testing, and debate. In spite of published reports about dispersant toxicity and effectiveness vary greatly, most spill response experts agree that oil spill dispersants are a valuable tool for responding to marine oil spills. Dispersants are oil spill response chemicals {{that are used to}} disperse floating oil into the water column. Dispersant cause a temporary increase in the concentration of oil in the water column, but do not add to the inherent toxicity of oil. Dispersants are effective in getting more oil into the water column compared to the amount that enters in the absence of dispersants, but the inherent toxicity of the oil remains the same whether physically or chemically dispersed. By increasing the surface area of oil, dispersants can facilitate biodegradation of oil. Effective of dispersants during the early phases of oil spill response may prevent or reduce impacts to coastal habitats and wildlife. This means {{that it is important to}} be prepared before the situation arises. Personnel should be well trained and needed equipment easily available. A pre-made priority list of different geographical areas to protect is a vital tool to make the correct decisions when concentrating the effort.

40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of the tanning industry is generally significant with outputs of wastes, i. e. high concentrations of organics, salts and heavy metals (chromium compounds), both in solid and liquid form, as a result. In order to bring the tanning industry {{more in line with}} present environmental thinking, various methods have been devised to reduce impacts. The underlying study proposes a modification of the method for unhairing–liming of hides where the unhairing–liming liquids are reused several times after being recharged by reduced quantities of chemicals. The study, therefore, aims at reducing both the economic and environmental costs of the unhairing–liming process. Experiments were carried out at lab scale with a simulation apparatus designed for the purpose. Life cycle assessment was used to evaluate the <b>net</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>benefits</b> of the modified method. The present value approach was used to evaluate the economic feasibility of the modified method. The quality of the produced leather was assessed by experts from the tanning sector (tanners). On the environmental level, the modified method reduced the {{environmental impact}} of the process by 24 %, COD was reduced by 50 % as well as sulfide which was reduced by 73 % when the process water was recycled four times. The modified method requires some investment in new equipment and is a little more labor intensive as compared with the conventional method but does permit for savings in water up to 58 % and chemicals up to 28 % as well as wastewater treatment cost which was reduced by 58 %. The modified method allowed for four times reuse of the unhairing–liming liquor without visibly affecting the quality of the final product of leather. It was concluded that both the economic and the environmental costs of the unhairing–liming process were reduced relative to the same of the conventional method...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of construction and demolition (C&D) waste and waste glass {{is a serious}} concern in Hong Kong, {{as well as other}} countries due to their non-combustible and non-putrescible nature, and the running out of disposal outlets. However, mineral wastes derived from C&D activities and waste glass are considered to have potential to be re-used as construction materials, especially as aggregates. In addition, Hong Kong urgently needs alternative and sustainable sources of aggregate, as the local quarry sites for aggregate production are expected to be exhausted soon. Many experimental studies have demonstrated that recycled aggregates from C&D waste and waste glass can be potentially recycled for various engineering applications in Hong Kong, but no study has yet attempted to assess the sustainability by lifecycle assessment (LCA) techniques. In order to increase the environmental awareness in the construction industry, assessment of the environmental performance of construction materials by LCA is therefore needed. The present study was conducted to assess and compare the environmental consequences of recycled aggregates production from C&D waste and waste glass, and natural aggregate production from virgin materials by LCA by using case specific and first hand data. The results reveal that compared with natural coarse aggregates, recycled coarse aggregates produced from C&D waste reduce 65 % greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission with a saving of 58 % non-renewable energy consumption. Similar <b>environmental</b> <b>benefits</b> are observed for producing recycled fine aggregates from C&D waste. In addition, compared with the production of natural fine aggregates from river sand, producing recycled fine aggregates from waste glass saves 54 % energy consumption and reduces 61 % GHGs, and 46 % SO 2 eq emissions. According to the IMPACT 2002 + Method, significant health, resource, climate change and ecosystem damages can be saved in producing recycled aggregates from both waste materials compared to producing and importing aggregates from virgin sources. This is the first ever LCA study on producing recycled aggregates from waste glass. Therefore, it can be concluded that substantial <b>net</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>benefits</b> can be realized for producing recycled aggregates from C&D waste and waste glass. The results can provide a guidance to maximize C&D waste and waste glass recycling, resourceful treatment of wastes and conserve natural resources.

40|$|Significant {{efforts have}} been direct towards {{developing}} environmentally sustainable and economically beneficial treatment of olive mill wastes. Recently, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) {{has been shown to}} be a potentially beneficial approach for the treatment of olive mill wastes. When considering the use of HTC to treat these wastes, however, it is critical that its environmental implications be evaluated and subsequently compared to other commonly used treatment approaches. In this study, the environmental impacts associated with using HTC to treat olive mill wastes were evaluated and compared to aerobic composting, anaerobic digestion, and incineration using life cycle assessment. Results indicate that HTC coupled with subsequent energy recovery from the combustion of the generated hydrochar results in <b>net</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>benefits</b> and that the energy offsets derived from electricity production from hydrochar combustion are critical to achieving these savings. In addition, results indicate that HTC process water discharge significantly influences system environmental impacts, indicating that research investigating treatment alternatives is needed. Changes in carbonization temperature and hydrochar moisture content also influence system environmental impact, suggesting that both are important when considering possible industrial applications. In comparison with current management approaches, alternatives using HTC are more environmental advantageous than composting and anaerobic digestion. However, the use of HTC is not as environmentally advantageous as incineration with energy recovery because 45 - 35 % of the energy contained in the olive mill waste is lost during HTC. However, if the electricity recovery efficiency from incineration increases to greater than 30 %, the environmental impacts associated with HTC and subsequent energy generation are equal to or better than direct TPOWM incineration with energy recovery. It is recommended that future research efforts focus on the evaluation of appropriate and environmentally beneficial HTC process water treatment approaches and methods to improve the energetic retention efficiencies of the hydrochar.
