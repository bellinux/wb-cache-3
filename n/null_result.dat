5|$|If a photon {{did have}} non-zero mass, {{there would be}} other effects as well. Coulomb's law would be {{modified}} and the electromagnetic field would have an extra physical degree of freedom. These effects yield more sensitive experimental probes of the photon mass than the frequency dependence {{of the speed of}} light. If Coulomb's law is not exactly valid, then that would allow the presence of an electric field to exist within a hollow conductor when it is subjected to an external electric field. This thus allows one to test Coulomb's law to very high precision. A <b>null</b> <b>result</b> of such an experiment has set a limit of m ≲ 10−14eV/c2.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} a Universe filled with a luminiferous aether {{remained}} in vogue among some scientists until the early 20th century. This form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate. In 1887, the Michelson–Morley experiment tried to detect the Earth's motion through this medium by looking {{for changes in the}} speed of light depending on the direction of the planet's motion. However, the <b>null</b> <b>result</b> indicated something was wrong with the concept. The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned. It was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant, independent of the observer's motion or frame of reference.|$|E
40|$|It {{is always}} {{difficult}} to interpret <b>null</b> <b>results.</b> But as a research method, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has so many degrees of freedom that <b>null</b> <b>results</b> are often dismissed as meaningless. We feel {{that this may be}} unnecessary, if not counterproductive. <b>Null</b> <b>results</b> seem to inherently fulfill an important role in brain mapping. In fact, without <b>null</b> <b>results,</b> neuroimaging as an enterprise would not make sense. We argue that <b>null</b> <b>results</b> are similarly important in TMS research. By itself, neuroimaging research leaves room for doubt concerning whether or not an activated region is actually necessary for intact task performance. Interference methods such as TMS can therefore complement brain research by testing the functional relevance of that region. However, if then only positive TMS results are taken seriously, the brain interference paradigm seems less informative than promised. But how can <b>null</b> <b>results</b> inform us if they only constitute absence of evidence? We suggest that three main arguments contravene interpretation of <b>null</b> <b>results</b> in TMS. These we call the localization argument, the neural efficacy argument, and the power argument. We proceed to discuss in turn how, and under which conditions, each of these arguments may be nuanced. These considerations lead us to value <b>null</b> <b>results</b> along a gradient of meaningfulness, rather than a dichotomy. This perspective may open up a new range of TMS applications, where research questions about the lack of functional relevance of a particular brain region become valid. In this context we make specific recommendations on experimentation and interpretation. We propose that it is often not only meaningful to interpret <b>null</b> <b>results,</b> but also useful to make such findings available to the community, especially now that improved methods and an expanded knowledge base make <b>null</b> <b>results</b> more interpretable than {{they have been in the}} past.

25|$|The {{constancy}} of {{the speed}} of light was motivated by Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism and the lack of evidence for the luminiferous ether.

40|$|Signals broadly {{compatible}} with light (7 - 10 GeV) dark matter {{have been reported}} in three direct detection experiments: CoGeNT, DAMA/LIBRA, and CDMS-II silicon. These possible signals have been interpreted in the context of spin-independent interactions between the target nuclei and dark matter, although there is tension with <b>null</b> <b>results,</b> particularly from xenon-based experiments. In this paper, we demonstrate that the CoGeNT and CDMS-II silicon results are also compatible assuming a spin-dependent neutron interaction, though this is in tension with xenon-based experiments and PICASSO. The tension with the <b>null</b> <b>results</b> from XENON 100 and XENON 10 is approximately the same as for the spin-independent coupling.

25|$|The {{extent to}} which the <b>null</b> <b>result</b> of the Michelson–Morley {{experiment}} influenced Einstein is disputed.

25|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} using similar but increasingly sophisticated apparatuses all returned the <b>null</b> <b>result</b> as well. Conceptually different experiments that also attempted to detect {{the motion of the}} aether were the Trouton–Noble experiment(1903), whose objective was to detect torsion effects caused by electrostatic fields, and the experiments of Rayleigh and Brace (1902, 1904), to detect double refraction in various media.

30|$|There are two {{rationales}} here. First, {{negative and}} <b>null</b> <b>results</b> are also significant research outcomes, {{though they may}} not look path-breaking and prize-awarding. The scientific community and the wider public {{need to know the}} more complete picture of all results. Second, they also need to know how come there are negative and <b>null</b> <b>results</b> so that we can learn from them and prevent repeating past mistakes. Learning from failure together is a significant, positive and humble scientific endeavor. This is the gist of results-free peer review: as far as a piece of research has accomplished all the necessary procedures and steps to embrace openness, honesty, integrity and transparency, despite that it does not achieve expected outcome, it should still be published and recognized. Publishing negative and <b>null</b> <b>results</b> could also encourage new advancements based on these results. The spirit is this: it is perfectly okay to fail—we want to see how and why a result can bounce back from past failure.|$|R

25|$|In 1887 he {{collaborated with}} {{colleague}} Edward Williams Morley of Western Reserve University, {{now part of}} Case Western Reserve University, in the Michelson–Morley experiment.

The Michelson-Morley results were immensely influential in the physics community, leading Hendrik Lorentz to devise his now-famous Lorentz contraction equations {{as a means of}} explaining the <b>null</b> <b>result.</b>|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{of absence}} is {{evidence}} of any kind {{that can be used}} to infer or deduce the non-existence or non-presence of something. For instance, if a doctor does not find any malignant cells in a patient this <b>null</b> <b>result</b> (finding nothing) {{is evidence of}} absence of cancer, even though the doctor has not actually detected anything per se. Such inductive reasoning is important to empiricism and science, but has well established limitations. The challenge thus becomes to try to identify when a researcher has received a <b>null</b> <b>result</b> (found nothing) because the thing does not exist (evidence of absence—objectively negative result), and when one simply lacks proper means of detection (absence of evidence—false negative).|$|E
25|$|By {{determining}} {{that a given}} experiment or method of detection is sensitive and reliable enough to detect the presence of X (when X is present) one can confidently exclude the possibility that X may be both undetected and present.

25|$|In 1902–1906, Dayton Miller {{repeated}} the Michelson–Morley experiment together with Edward W. Morley. They confirmed the <b>null</b> <b>result</b> {{of the initial}} experiment. However, in 1921–1926, Miller conducted new experiments which apparently gave positive results. Those experiments initially attracted some attention {{in the media and}} in the scientific community but have been considered refuted for the following reasons: Einstein, Max Born, and Robert S. Shankland pointed out that Miller hadn't appropriately considered the influence of temperature. A modern analysis by Roberts shows that Miller's experiment gives a <b>null</b> <b>result,</b> when the technical shortcomings of the apparatus and the error bars are properly considered. Additionally, Miller's result is in disagreement with all other experiments, which were conducted before and after. For example, Georg Joos (1930) used an apparatus of similar dimensions to Miller's, but he obtained null results. In recent experiments of Michelson–Morley type where the coherence length is increased considerably by using lasers and masers the results are still negative.|$|E
