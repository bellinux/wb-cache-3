Determination of an optimum HTR-strategy with the successive closing of the fuel element cycle for HTR in normal converter operation and for HTR in high converter operation.

Balancing up of all suitable alternatives for central and decentral positions for nuclear power stations including the facilities for nuclear disposal.

40|$|Abstract: The French <b>nuclear</b> <b>park</b> {{comprises}} 58 {{nuclear reactors}} distributed {{through the national}} territory on 19 geographical sites. They must be repeatedly stopped, for refuelling and maintenance. The scheduling of these outages has to comply with various constraints, regarding safety, maintenance logistic, and plant operation, whilst it must contribute to the producer profit maximization. We present in this paper a new approach for modelling and solving this problem. It combines three optimization techniques: constraint programming, local search and linear programming. Constraint programming and local search are combined {{to solve the problem}} in approximated way. They search, relatively to an heuristic cost criterion, a good outages schedule. The linear programming is used to precisely evaluate the quality of the solutions found and to produce marginal costs used for updating the heuristic cost in order to escape from the local optima. The effectiveness of the approach is tested on the simple heuristic cost criterion which consists to minimize the numbers of outages in winters. The experimental results are satisfactory...|$|E

40|$|The civil liabiliy {{of nuclear}} {{operators}} are regulated by {{two sets of}} international Conventions. In particular, strict liability, limited financial responsibility and the obligation of providing financial guaranties are imposed to the nuclear operator by the Paris Convention and the Vienna Convention. Then national legislations are free to increase the financial cap of responsibility fixed by the international regimes. First we present the main elements of these Conventions. Then {{we focus on the}} impact of a modification in the amount of responsibility of the nuclear operator on his risk mitigation policy and on his financial condition. In particular we show that an increase of the cap beyond a given level determined by the model gives the operator some incentives to lessen the investment in prevention, contrary to what is expected.

40|$|With {{the aging}} of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>park,</b> {{decommissioning}} and dismantling of nuclear installations after their service life is becoming an important issue for the nuclear industry. The radiological characterisation of the equipment and structures present in the reactor and its environment is an essential stage in a decommissioning project since it permits to define and optimize the decommissioning strategy and the disassembling operations. In addition, correct activation estimates are essential for determining the quantity {{and the nature of the}} radiological waste generated during decommissioning. The adoption of efficient dismantling procedures and the optimization of the mass flow going to different waste repositories might reduce substantially the total cost of decommissioning. The present work has been done in the framework of the decommissioning and dismantling of the experimental reactor of the University of Strasburg (RUS). A methodology that combines theoretical calculations and direct measurements has been developed for determining the long-term induced activity in the graphite, concrete and materials present in the reactor. After characterisation of the different elements present in the reactor, it is then possible to plan efficiently the disassembling and dismantling of the system and to optimise the mass flow going to different waste repositories. From a scientific perspective, the comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental values validates the approach and the methodology used in the present study and tests the consistency and the reliability of the nuclear data used for activation analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of radioactive wastes from the nuclear fuel cycle {{has become an}} important issue {{in the development of}} future, more sustainable nuclear energy systems. Partitioning and transmutation (P&T) of actinides and some long-lived fission products could reduce the mass and radiotoxicity of highlevel wastes and possibly ease repository licensing requirements. Influenced by political and technological developments, an increasing number of countries employing nuclear power have become interested in P&T technology which involves the development of new types of critical and/or sub-critical reactors and very efficient fuel cycle strategies. The present thesis is closely connected to two P&T related projects of the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency in Paris, a numerical benchmark exercise for an accelerator-driven minor actinides burner and a calculational system study on the role of accelerator-driven systems (ADS) and advanced fast reactors (FR) in advanced nuclear fuel cycles. The author co-coordinated the benchmark exercise and performed the comparative analysis of the different "fuel cycle schemes" investigated in the system study. The benchmark exercise contributed to a greater understanding of the physical phenomena characteristic of the transmutation of actinides in a closed fuel cycle, and allowed to test and improve the tools used for modeling ADSs and corresponding advanced fuel cycles. This work thus effectively {{led to the development of}} an efficient and more complete calculational scheme, which has permitted an in-depth and reliable analysis of different transmutation scenarios to be carried out. To quantitatively assess the advantages and drawbacks of transmutation, we considered a limited number of "base" transmutation scenarios which constitute an envelope for various possible transmutation strategies employing fast spectrum systems. We then evaluated, for an equilibrium situation, the main aspects which characterise the different transmutation strategies, such as the <b>nuclear</b> <b>park</b> composition, the mass and toxicity of the waste, the need for natural uranium, the in-pile and out-pile mass inventories and, finally, the fuel cycle requirements. Thus, this study has allowed for the reliable comparison of performances of the three main options in the nuclear waste management, viz. open cycle, recycling of plutonium alone and recycling of all the actinides, as well as an evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of ADSs in comparison to advanced critical reactors in the {{management of}} minor actinides or transuranics. The last part of the dissertation is dedicated to a phase-out study for two schemes employing either ADSs or critical reactors. It has been shown thereby that advanced systems, optimised for an equilibrium fuel composition, can indeed be used to reduce the inventory of transuranics. A comparison of ADS and FR performances has been made in this context, and the relative benefits of transmutation have been quantified in each case taking into consideration, more realistically, the residual mass inventory after the shutdown of all nuclear installations...|$|E

Consequently, the industrial organization of these specific sectors is of the utmost importance. This paper aims at studying this question. We focus on the associated costs of prevention and civil liability. We analyze how civil liability rules may contribute to extend or to discourage the expansion of <b>nuclear</b> <b>parks</b> to new operators. The paper compares the consequences of extending the management of nuclear stations to several independent operators. This question can apply to the unification process of the European electricity market in which several public and private nuclear power operators are running. The paper shows that the choice between either a monopolistic scheme (one operator managing several plants) or a decentralized one (one operator by station) depends {{on the condition of}} application of the legal civil liability regime and on the strength of the safety control exerted by the Nuclear Regulatory Authorities. It is shown that when the control is high, then the safety costs generated by the monopolistic organization are less than the same costs of a decentralized one.

By use of the implemented solution, wind power can consequently be confronted to operational constraints related to high-powered thermal units, <b>nuclear</b> <b>parks</b> or cogeneration. Moreover, in order to optimize the large-scale integration of wind power production, the required reinforcements on a given electrical grid can also be evaluated on basis of the presented developments. The elaborated strategy can practically be applied to every kind of nonsequential Monte Carlo approach used to technically analyze a given transmission system.

40|$|The EHRO-N team of JRC-IET {{provides}} the EC with essential data related to {{supply and demand}} for nuclear experts based on bottom-up information from the nuclear industry. The current paper deals with an alternative approach to derive figures for the demand side information of the nuclear workforce. Complementary to the bottom-up approach, a top-down modelling approach extrapolation of an EC Energy Roadmap nuclear energy demand scenario is followed here {{in addition to the}} survey information. In this top-down modelling approach, the number of nuclear power plants that are in operation and under construction is derived as a function of time from 2010 up to 2050 assuming that the current reactor park will be replaced by generic third generation reactors of 1400 MWe or 1000 MWe. Depending on the size of new build reactors, the analysis shows the number of new reactors required to fulfil the demand for nuclear energy. Based on workforce models for operation and construction of nuclear power plants, the model allows an extrapolation of these respective workforces. Using the nuclear skills pyramid, the total workforce employed at a plant is broken down in a nuclear (experts), nuclearized, and nuclear aware workforce. With retirement profiles for nuclear power plants derived from the bottom-up EHRO-N survey, the replacement of the current workforce is taken into account. The peak of the new workforce (partly replacing the retiring workforce and additionally keeping up with the growing total workforce demand) for nuclear experts and nuclearized employees is to be expected {{at the end of the}} considered period (2050). However, the peak workforce for nuclear aware employees is to be expected around 2020. When comparing to historical data for the nuclear capacity being installed at the same time in Europe, it is clear that the expected future capacity to be installed at the same time in Europe is significantly lower (factor of 2) than in the early 1980 ’s. However, it should be realized that the skills demand might have been more relaxed in those days. Furthermore, a steep rise in construction is to be expected within 10 to 15 years. This is due to the fact that not only additional nuclear power plants need to be built to keep up with the growing nuclear energy demand, but also the current <b>nuclear</b> reactor <b>park</b> needs to be replaced. In order to deal with this steep rise, the nuclear industry may consider buying time by extending the lifetime of the current <b>nuclear</b> reactor <b>park.</b> JRC.

The study of heavy-quark (charm and bottom) production in such collisions provides key tests of parton energy-loss models and, thus, yields profound insight into the properties of the produced matter. The high-pT yield of heavy-flavor decay electrons exhibits an unexpected large suppression. Since those single electrons have contributions from charm and bottom decays an experimental method is needed to investigate them separately. Heavy-flavor particle correlations provide information about the underlying production mechanism. In this contribution, a review on recent measurements on azimuthal correlations of single electrons and open charmed mesons at RHIC and perspectives of such measurements at the CERN-Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are presented. Moreover, it has been shown that next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD processes, such as gluon splitting, become important at LHC energies.

Measurements in these collision systems are therefore essential to disentangle initial state nuclear effects from cold nuclear matter effects, medium-induced k_T broadening and jet quenching. To obtain complete description of the p+p (d+Au) collision {{it is also important}} to study particle production in the underlying event. The measured properties of underlying event can be used to tune the QCD based Monte-Carlo models. In this paper some of the recent results on jet and underlying event properties in p+p and d+Au collisions at √(s_NN) = 200 GeV measured by the STAR experiment are presented. In particular, the preliminary results on charged and strange particle fragmentation functions in p+p collisions are discussed and confronted with PYTHIA simulations. Next, the measurement of inclusive jet spectrum and di-jet correlations in d+Au collisions is presented and compared with the measurements in p+p collisions to estimate the size of cold nuclear matter effects. Finally, the study of underlying event properties in p+p collisions is shown and compared to PYTHIA simulation.

40|$|The United States Department of Energy has {{proposed}} building energy parks {{at some of}} its former <b>nuclear</b> sites. These <b>parks</b> would develop technologies to enhance renewable energy sources, nuclear, coal, and others, as well as technologies to manage the waste, and transmit the energy. A survey of 3200 United States residents assessed public reaction to the policy. Half of the samples were gathered at four locations each centered on a major DOE facility; 25 % were obtained at two other regions; and 25 % were a national sample. As a whole, respondents from the four DOE-centered sites were more supportive of the concept than their counterparts, especially those respondents who lived in counties within 20 miles of the DOE site. Their support is associated {{with knowledge of the}} existing DOE facilities, desire for greater reliance on renewable energy sources and nuclear power, and a belief that the environment will improve during the next 25 years. They disproportionately trust authorities responsible for managing major energy facilities and assess the economic impact of these facilities to be positive. The challenge to proponents of energy parks is to broaden the support among the 60 % that had more lukewarm or neutral responses to the idea and to place the proposal in the larger national energy policy context.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is to identify new basic science {{that will be the}} foundation for advances in nuclear fuel-cycle technology in the near term, and for changing the nature of fuel cycles and of the nuclear energy industry in the long term. The goals are to enhance the development of nuclear energy, to maximize energy production in <b>nuclear</b> reactor <b>parks,</b> and to minimize radioactive wastes, other environmental impacts, and proliferation risks. The limitations of the once-through fuel cycle can be overcome by adopting a closed fuel cycle, in which the irradiated fuel is reprocessed and its components are separated into streams that are recycled into a reactor or disposed of in appropriate waste forms. The recycled fuel is irradiated in a reactor, where certain constituents are partially transmuted into heavier isotopes via neutron capture or into lighter isotopes via fission. Fast reactors are required to complete the transmutation of long-lived isotopes. Closed fuel cycles are encompassed by the Department of Energy?s Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI), to which basic scientific research can contribute. Two nuclear reactor system architectures can meet the AFCI objectives: a ?single-tier? system or a ?dual-tier? system. Both begin with light water reactors and incorporate fast reactors. The ?dual-tier? systems transmute some plutonium and neptunium in light water reactors and all remaining transuranic elements (TRUs) in a closed-cycle fast reactor. Basic science initiatives are needed in two broad areas: ? Near-term impacts that can enhance the development of either ?single-tier? or ?dual-tier? AFCI systems, primarily within the next 20 years, through basic research. Examples: Dissolution of spent fuel, separations of elements for TRU recycling and transmutation Design, synthesis, and testing of inert matrix nuclear fuels and non-oxide fuels Invention and development of accurate on-line monitoring systems for chemical and nuclear species in the nuclear fuel cycle Development of advanced tools for designing reactors with reduced margins and lower costs ? Long-term nuclear reactor development requires basic science breakthroughs: Understanding of materials behavior under extreme environmental conditions Creation of new, efficient, environmentally benign chemical separations methods Modeling and simulation to improve nuclear reaction cross-section data, design new materials and separation system, and propagate uncertainties within the fuel cycle Improvement of proliferation resistance by strengthening safeguards technologies and decreasing the attractiveness of nuclear materials A series of translational tools is proposed to advance the AFCI objectives and to bring the basic science concepts and processes promptly into the technological sphere. These tools have the potential to revolutionize the approach to nuclear engineering R&D by replacing lengthy experimental campaigns with a rigorous approach based on modeling, key fundamental experiments, and advanced simulations...|$|R
