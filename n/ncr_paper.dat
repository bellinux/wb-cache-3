Deinking paper {{is very important in}} the process of recycling paper. Xylanase application of research required for deinking outworn <b>NCR</b> <b>paper</b> and paper money. Deinking enzymatic is a clean technology and produces less waste than conventional deinking (chemicals). Xylanase AQ- 1 which is a crude enzyme from Bacillus sp isolates AQ- 1 can work well in the deinking process on the amount of enzyme addition of 0. 2 % in the pulp with the conditions of pH 7 and temperature of 50 oC for 120 minutes. While the recombinant xylanase AQ- 1 which is the result of genetic xylanase AQ- 1 grown in E. coli can work well in the deinking process on the amount of enzyme addition of 0. 1 % in the pulp with the conditions of pH 7 and temperature of 50 oC for 60 minutes. Xylanase AQ- 1 increases the degree of whiteness of green <b>NCR</b> <b>paper</b> pulp from the control (40. 1) into (53. 9) and pulp paper moneyof the control (50. 1) into (66. 6). While AQ- 1 recombinant xylanase increases the degree of whiteness of green <b>NCR</b> <b>paper</b> pulp from control (40. 1) into (52. 0) pulp and paper money from the control (50. 1) into (63. 4).

Javanese typeface (font) also already developed according to Unicode standard. The problem using Javanese Unicode standard {{is not easy}} to write Javanese in computer media. Transliterator program named JawaTeX can perform transliterate from Latin to Javanese script. The JawaTeX program produces several documents: parsing document, TeX document and post script document as final document that can be port into pdf document. Web based JawaTeX also developed to produce image based Javanese script embedded on HTML. JawaTeX can be modified to produce HTML format based on Javanese Unicode. The HTML file is constructed by numeric character reference (NCR) associate to Javanese Unicode standard. Having Javanese Unicode HTML document is more portable and flexible. Using Unicode typeface and JawaTeX capability and <b>NCR</b> this <b>paper</b> will introduce a concept to build Javanese transliterator having HTML based file as an output...|$|R
