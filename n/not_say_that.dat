5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He would <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the {{defendant}} must be present at all stages of the trial. There should be a reluctance to consider the applicability of Article 75 of Protocol I, since the U.S. never signed it and thus it is not binding. Kennedy writes that he feels {{it was not necessary}} to delve into the validity of the conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view on the merits of the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E
5|$|Cameron and Comfort {{participated in}} a {{televised}} debate with atheists Brian Sapient and Kelly O'Conner of the Rational Response Squad, at Calvary Baptist Church, in Manhattan, on May 5, 2007. It was moderated by ABC's Martin Bashir and parts of it were aired on Nightline. At issue was the existence of God, which Comfort stated he could prove scientifically, without relying on faith or the Bible. The audience was composed of both theists and atheists. Points of discussion included atheism and evolution. While Sapient contended during his arguments that Comfort violated the rules by talking about the Ten Commandments, Cameron later stated on The Way of the Master radio show that {{the rules of the}} debate did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the Bible could never be referenced, but rather that Comfort simply {{had to come up with}} one argument that did not reference the Bible or faith.|$|E

5000|$|In a 2004 Rolling Stone cover story, Thurman and {{director}} Quentin Tarantino denied {{having had a}} romantic relationship, despite Tarantino once having told a reporter, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> we haven’t, and I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> we have." [...] Rumours of their relationship were rekindled after they appeared together at the Pulp Fiction 20th anniversary tribute at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.|$|R
60|$|At all events, {{there can}} be no excuse for your <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> you know you're utterly unworthy of me.|$|R
25|$|While most Pentecostals and Charismatics {{believe the}} Bible {{to be the}} {{ultimate}} authority and would <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> any new revelation can ever contradict the Bible, they do believe that God continues to speak to people today on extra-biblical topics as well as to interpret and apply the text of the Bible.|$|E
25|$|Emergency {{response}} was delayed because telephones {{inside the building}} could not be used. The plant owner's son drove to the fire station and informed them there that the factory was on fire but did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> workers {{were still in the}} plant. More than 100 medical and emergency service personnel went to the scene, some of whom ran from a local hospital, and nearby towns provided emergency evacuation for the injured via four air ambulances from the local hospital to nearby burns units.|$|E
25|$|I {{have learned}} {{that many of the}} Greeks believe Pythagoras said all things are {{generated}} from number. The very assertion poses a difficulty: How can things which do not exist even be conceived to generate? But he did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> all things come to be from number; rather, in accordance with number – on the grounds that order in the primary sense is in number and it is by participation in order that a first and a second and the rest sequentially are assigned to things which are counted.|$|E
40|$|When we <b>say</b> of {{something}} <b>that</b> it is unreliable we are <b>not</b> necessarily <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> {{the chances of}} it behaving as one expects equal the chances of it behaving otherwise. The train service in Lisbon is reliable, I tell you, yet the ambulance service in Lisbon is unreliable. By this, I am <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> I’ve never boarded...|$|R
50|$|I {{want you}} to hear me tonight, I am <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> President Obama is the Antichrist, I am <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> at all. One reason I know he's not the Antichrist is the Antichrist is going to have much higher poll numbers when he comes. President Obama is not the Antichrist. But what I am saying is this: the course he is {{choosing}} to lead our nation is paving the way for the future reign of the Antichrist.|$|R

25|$|That is <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape belongs {{analytic}} or synthetic Cubism. It does not. The {{subject is}} viewed from {{one point of}} view, not several. There is no true 'mobile perspective', anymore than {{in the works of}} Cézanne or Seurat. But a departure from nature it was, and a departure from all that had been painted to date it was too; a precursor in style, certainly, one that would resurface in the works of Metzinger and others (Gino Severini, Robert Delaunay, Piet Mondrian) several years later, within the context of Cubism.|$|E
25|$|Rugby {{union is}} {{played on a}} field, known as a pitch, that should have a grassy surface, though the Laws {{permit the use of}} {{artificial}} grass, clay, sand or snow, but not permanently hard surfaces such as asphalt or concrete. The Laws do <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the pitch needs to be flat or level, merely that the surface must be safe to play on. If either team feels that the pitch is unsafe, the referee must try to resolve the issues and must not start the match if any part of the ground is considered to be dangerous.|$|E
25|$|We {{shall not}} say more {{concerning}} the corrective process afforded to the petitioners than {{that it does}} not seem to us sufficient to allow a Judge of the United States to escape the duty of examining the facts for himself when if true as alleged they make the trial absolutely void. We have confined the statement to facts admitted by the demurrer. We will <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> they cannot be met, but it appears to us unavoidable that the District Judge should find whether the facts alleged are true and whether they can be explained so far as to leave the state proceedings undisturbed.|$|E

50|$|Author Louis Menand {{argues that}} the book has been {{commonly}} misused by liberals and conservatives alike, who cited it for their own ideological agendas. Menand wrote: Lasch was <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> things were better in the 1950s, as conservatives offended by countercultural permissiveness probably took him to be <b>saying.</b> He was <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> things were better in the 1960s, as former activists disgusted by the 'me-ism' of the seventies {{are likely to have}} imagined. He was diagnosing a condition that he believed had originated in the nineteenth century. Lasch attempted to correct many of these misapprehensions with The Minimal Self in 1984.|$|R
5000|$|Shepard and {{his wife}} are advocates of no-kids paparazzi. Bell said: [...] "We're <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> we can't be newsworthy. We're <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> our child is not newsworthy." [...] California Senate Bill 606 passed in 2013, with {{testimony}} by actors Halle Berry and Jennifer Garner.|$|R
25|$|May we <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> in the fortuitous {{combination}} of the productions of Nature, since only those creatures could survive in whose organizations {{a certain degree of}} adaptation was present, there is nothing extraordinary in the fact that such adaptation is actually found in all these species which now exist? Chance, one might say, turned out a vast number of individuals; a small proportion of these were organized in such a manner that the animals' organs could satisfy their needs. A much greater number showed neither adaptation nor order; these last have all perished.... Thus the species which we see today are but a small part of all those that a blind destiny has produced.|$|E
25|$|The killing {{has been}} dated to 1016, {{as this is}} the year it falls under in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the Chronicle of John of Worcester and the Historia Regum. Historian A. A. M. Duncan has argued that this date is unreliable. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, {{reflecting}} closely the source for the Historia Regum and the Worcester Chronicle on this entry, does <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Uhtred died in this year, merely adding as an aside that Uhtred and Thurcytel were later killed despite having submitted to Cnut in this year. The location of this killing is given as Wiheal. This has been identified as Wighill, a place just north-west of the Roman road north of Tadcaster but south of York. This identity however is far from secure, an alleged weak point being that the early spellings of Wighill (e.g. Wichele) do not resemble De Obsessiones Wiheal very closely. Another possibility is Worrall near Sheffield, spelled Wihala and Wihale in the Domesday Book.|$|E
25|$|In Washington v. Harper, the {{individual}} protesting the involuntary medication was already incarcerated. The Court suggested {{in this case}} that a competent person has the right to refuse if the medication is administered for other than treatment reasons to a person not dangerous or extremely ill, but it accepted the institution's procedures for making such treatment decisions. However, Riggins was not convicted {{at the time he was}} involuntarily medicated. In Riggins v. Nevada, the Court said that not only had the medication to be a medically appropriate means of attaining an important state objective such as competency, but the medication must be the least intrusive means of attaining the objective. However, although the treatment must be the least intrusive (for example, to allow {{the individual}} to retain a clear head to consult with his attorney as well as to avoid medication side effects), the court did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> involuntary medication is never appropriate to achieve the state's goal.|$|E
5000|$|Tom Hazelhurst remarked, [...] "Under Bill's tutelage, {{they built}} damn good boats. I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> because I was their {{advertising}} man, but because I bought {{two of their}} boats. The boats just don't break." ...|$|R

3000|$|... ● The {{conclusions}} are <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> ATP-funded joint ventures led to less patenting; rather, ATP joint venture participants (especially small companies) did not patent {{as much as}} small company single applicants during the active project period.|$|R
25|$|David Miller {{has criticized}} {{this kind of}} {{criticism}} by Salmon and others because it makes inductivist assumptions. Popper does <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> corroboration is an indicator of predictive power. The predictive power is in the theory itself, not in its corroboration. The rational motivation for choosing a well-corroborated theory {{is that it is}} simply easier to falsify: Well-corroborated means that at least one kind of experiment (already conducted at least once) could have falsified (but did not actually falsify) the one theory, while the same kind of experiment, regardless of its outcome, could not have falsified the other. So it is rational to choose the well-corroborated theory: It may not be more likely to be true, but if it is actually false, it is easier to get rid of when confronted with the conflicting evidence that will eventually turn up. Accordingly, it is wrong to consider corroboration as a reason, a justification for believing in a theory or as an argument in favor of a theory to convince someone who objects to it.|$|E
25|$|Seedman {{established}} himself as a detective during the 1960s. As the detective commander for Brooklyn, he once oversaw an investigation of a shooting death, in which over 2,000 people were interviewed, that turned out to have been a freak accident. He investigated many prominent crimes during that era, including the Borough Park Tobacco robbery and the Kitty Genovese murder. As the chief of detective he reformed that branch by assigning detectives to specialize in certain areas of crime rather than just investigating whatever cases came their way when they were on shift. His tenure as chief of detectives of the city was short but memorable, marked by the Knapp Commission's corruption investigations which briefly cost him his job, several mob hits and terror attacks carried out by the Black Liberation Army (BLA). When his superior officers hindered his investigation into the murder of an officer at a Harlem mosque out of fear of a race riot, Seedman resigned his position and retired from the force, although he did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> had been the reason for another 40 years.|$|E
25|$|At the Fatal Accident Inquiry held in Banff in February 1972 Adam Watson was {{the chief}} expert witness for the Crown. It emerged that the consent form issued to parents did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> winter {{mountaineering}} was involved. Also, {{only one of the}} parents had been told the outing was going to be to the Cairngorms. The Inquiry reported that the deaths had been due to cold and exposure. It recommended (1) there should be special regard for fitness and training, (2) parents should be given fuller information about outdoor activities, (3) parties should be led by fully qualified instructors and accompanied by certified teachers, (4) suitable locations for summer and winter expeditions should be identified in consultation with mountaineering organisations, (5) experts should advise on whether high-level shelters should be removed, (6) the mountain rescue teams were praised and consideration should be given to supporting the teams financially and generally, (7) following any future disaster there should be closer liaison between authorities and parents. The jury did not want to discourage future adventurous outdoor activities. The advocate for the parents suggested that the overall leader of the expedition and the principal of Lagganlia should be found at fault but the Inquiry did not make any finding of fault.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it has. I {{beg your}} pardon, {{but it must}} have, and should {{have a great deal}} to do with it. Of course, I am <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> anybody should now ever be {{compelled}} to marry anybody." ...|$|R

50|$|There {{are four}} common gods of the Tilean city-states. <b>That</b> is <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> there are <b>not</b> other cults in the cities, {{and it is}} not {{uncommon}} to have more than one major temple in any of the city-states.|$|R

500|$|Till's {{murder was}} the focus of a 1957 {{television}} episode for the U.S. Steel Hour titled [...] "Noon on Doomsday" [...] written by Rod Serling. He was fascinated by how quickly Mississippi whites supported Bryant and Milam. Although the script was rewritten to avoid mention of Till, and did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the murder victim was black, White Citizens' Councils vowed to boycott U.S. Steel. The eventual episode bore little resemblance to the Till case.|$|E
500|$|Despite their {{political}} differences, Vane and Winthrop developed an epistolary {{relationship in the}} following years. [...] Vane's legacy from {{his time in the}} New World includes the colonial legislation appropriating £400 for the establishment of an institute of higher learning now known as Harvard University, and his support of Roger Williams in the acquisition of Aquidneck Island from the local Indians that resulted in the formal beginnings of Rhode Island. [...] The surviving accounts do <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Vane provide the funds for the acquisition; Williams credits Vane as being [...] "an instrument in the hand of God for procuring this island".|$|E
