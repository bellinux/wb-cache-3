40|$|The primary {{objective}} of disclosure of financial and non financial information is to inform analysts and investors about the amount, timing and uncertainty of future earnings. The value relevance of financial {{information provided by}} financial reports have been attracted many researchers {{and many of them}} found the positive relationships. This paper examines whether the level of <b>non</b> financial information <b>disclosure</b> affects the financial performance of companies. There are suggestions in the academic literature that providing additional financial or non financial information decreases information asymmetry between companies and investors, and also enhances corporate transparency. Although it is relatively reasonable to measure the financial performance of a company by indicators; it is not so reasonable to find out indicators to measure the non financial performance of a company. This is why the non financial information results from the organizational, market based, social and intellectual environment of the companies. In our paper, according to the previous literature, initially we indicated “disclosure scores ” for BIST 100 companies which refer to their level of <b>non</b> financial information <b>disclosures.</b> We benefited largely from the annual reports to find data concerning <b>non</b> financial <b>disclosure</b> of companies.

Since more than a decade, authentication protocols have been proposed and discussed. Because of various flaws which were found late, Burrows, Abadi and Needham [BAN] created a logic of authentication to formally verify authentication protocols {{by the end of}} the 80 's. This so called BAN logic has been subject to considerable critique and several extensions have been suggested. None the less, due to its straightforward design and easy understandability, it still attracts the attention of current research. We developed an authentication logic which is built closely after the BAN [...] logic. It addresses answers to important critiques of the BAN like the <b>non</b> [...] <b>disclosure</b> problem, and avoids some newly discovered weaknesses of BAN, e. g. with respect to freshness. We also built a verification tool embodying this extended BAN logic and the means for modelling the different participating principals as finite state machines. The tool allows therefore both for formal, passive analysis of an authentication protocol and for active simulation of a protocol run. We also can model actions of intruders, consequences of such intrusions, and the respective counter [...] measures. The tool is implemented in Prolog and facilitates exploratory design of new authentication protocols...|$|R

40|$|Magister CurationisA {{problem was}} {{identified}} at Aid for AIDS (AfA) whereby some doctors requested {{a change in}} treatment within {{less than a year}} after their patients started antiretroviral therapy. The requests were normally based on treatment failure. It appears that in most cases where the desired treatment outcome is not achieved is due to poor adherence to therapy. AfA is a HIV / AIDS disease management company offering access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), prevention of opportunistic infections, treatment and blood results monitoring, treatment support through adherence coordinators and expert clinical support and advice to healthcare providers. They monitor treatment adherence through claims history, CD 4 and viral load (VL) results as well as telephonic contact with the client. Factors that could contribute to poor adherence are side - effects, barriers e. g. work environment, <b>non</b> - <b>disclosure,</b> lifestyle, lack of client commitment, limited contact between the client and treatment support counsellor, limited funds, stigmatisation and a lack of clear adherence guidelines to improve treatment outcome. Method: A comparative study was done to assess the impact of an intervention to improve patient adherence to ART. The researcher postulates that by the implementation of guidelines to counsellors, client adherence to therapy would increase. A comparative study was used to assess whether structured guidelines can improve client adherence to therapy. Results: The results have proven that guidelines used by treatment support counsellors does improve adherence to ART.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{understand}} {{reasons for}} {{lost to follow-up}} (LTFU) from a community-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) program in Uganda. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort of patients LTFU between May 31, 2001 -May 31, 2010 was examined. A representative sample of 579 patients traced to ascertain their outcomes. METHODS: Mixed methods were used. Using "stopped care" as the hazard and "self-transferred" as the comparator we examined using Cox proportional multivariable model, risk factors for stopping care. RESULTS: Overall, 2933 / 3954 (74. 0 %) patients were LTFU. Of 579 / 2933 (19 %) patients sampled for tracing, 32 (5. 5 %) were untraceable, 66 (11. 4 %) were dead and 481 (83. 0 %) found alive. Of those found alive, 232 (40. 0 %) stopped care, 249 (43. 0 %) self-transferred, while 61 (12. 7 %) returned to care at ROM. In adjusted hazards ratios, born-again religion, originating from outside Kampala, resident in Kampala for one year, having school-age children who were out of school, <b>non</b> HIV <b>disclosure,</b> CD 4 counts > 250 cells/mm 3 and pre-ART were associated with increased risk of stopping care. Qualitative interviews revealed return to a normal life as a key reason for LTFU. Of 61 patients who returned to care, their median CD 4 count at LTFU was higher than on return into care (401 /mm 3 vs. 205 /mm 3, P< 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Many patients become LTFU {{during the course of}} years, necessitating the need for effective mechanisms to identify those in need of close monitoring. Efforts should be made to improve referrals and mechanisms to track patients who transfer to different facilities. Additionally, tracing of patients who become LTFU is required to convince them to return...|$|R
40|$|A rich {{empirical}} {{research suggests that}} corporate disclosures are important means for management to communicate firm performance and governance to outside investors. (e. g. Chau & Gray, 2002; Mohd Ghazali & Weetman, 2006). In the last few years, there is an increasing attention regarding non-financial information disclosure in companies' annual reports. An important development in relation to this is the discussion paper and subsequently statement practice on Management Commentary (MC) issued by the International Accounting Standard Board (IASB). However, differences in institutional characteristics affecting financial reporting incentives across countries adopting various pronouncements issued by IASB {{are expected to have}} an effect on the extent of <b>non</b> financial <b>disclosure</b> in MC (Soderstrom & Sun, 2007). Using the annual reports of 210 Malaysian listed companies, this study aims to investigate the effects of ownership structure on the extent of management commentary information in two disclosure periods (2006 and 2008). The two-year window period enables an examination of MC disclosure practices in the year before and after the revision of Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance in 2007. Results of this study provide evidence that family owned companies are associated with lower incentives to disclose more comprehensive MC disclosures. This result contradicts the relationships revealed by goverment owned companies. The interaction effects of firm performance on the relationships between ownership structure and the extent of MC disclosures only provide significant relationships for government owned companies. The insignificant effect on family owned companies suggest that managers in these companies avoid detailed disclosure of MC information in order to evade close monitoring by outside investors (Shleifer & Vishny, 1997). In addition, the results also indicate that the corporate governance revision has not resulted in the desired level of monitoring in influencing managers to disclose more comprehensive voluntary information. Alternatively, these results provide support to the view that mandatory requirements provide a vehicle through which countries characterized with concentrated ownership structure can enhance their financial reporting infrastructure and improve investor protection (Hope et al., 2006). Overall, the findings provide useful information to IASB, standard setters and other regulatory bodies in promoting transparency and convergence of corporate disclosures.

On his death in 1859 the estate and gardens were inherited by Staunton's cousin Henry Cormick Lynch. Henry Lynch died just six weeks after receiving his inheritance and it was in turn passed to his eldest son George Staunton Lynch who then changed his name to George Staunton Lynch-Staunton.

However, {{little is known about}} the reasons for (<b>non)</b> <b>disclosure</b> among caregivers and the psychological experience of (<b>non)</b> <b>disclosure</b> on patients. This thesis reports four studies on cancer diagnosis (<b>non)</b> <b>disclosure</b> in India using the Common Sense Model of illness representations as a theoretical framework. Study 1 explored the experiences of, and reasons for, (<b>non)</b> <b>disclosure</b> among family caregivers of cancer patients using a qualitative methodology. Informing caregivers cited a range of reasons for informing including patient's suspicion, preparation, patient's personality, lack of control, patient's emotional well-being and self-belief. In contrast, non-informing caregivers cited patient's emotional well-being, patient's personality, jeopardizing patient's lifespan and family concerns as reasons for not informing. Study 2 examined differences between informing and non-informing caregivers on various demographic, medical and psychological variables. Reasons for, and for not, informing were the most important discriminating variables; informing caregivers more likely to agree with preparing the patient and patient's personality as reasons for informing, whereas noninforming caregivers more likely to agree with longevity and patient's personality as reasons for not informing. Study 3 explored the experiences of (<b>non)</b> <b>disclosure</b> in cancer patients using a qualitative methodology. Non-informed patients had an intense negative experience of the illness and used only passive coping strategies, whereas informed patients used a range of coping strategies. Study 4 investigated differences between informed and non-informed patients on various demographic, medical and psychological variables. Non-informed patients were less educated, were less likely to be involved in medical decision-making, were less likely to be having a combination of treatments, had weaker illness coherence, and were less likely to engage in a range of coping strategies. The thesis findings have important implications for both patient care and our understanding of the role of illness perceptions in caregivers and patients.
