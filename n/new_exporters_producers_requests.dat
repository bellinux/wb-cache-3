40|$|The New Zealand Halal {{sheep meat}} and beef export market {{industry}} has faced several challenges in recent decades. This thesis examines and discusses {{the issues in}} this demanding field with respect to Indonesia and Malaysia as target markets. No previous research in this specific area has been performed. The methodology used to conduct this research is qualitative. Locally resident Indonesian and Muslim consumers of Halal food were invited to focus group meetings. Separate {{interviews were conducted with}} exporters, Government agencies and a Halal certification body in New Zealand. The study discovered that the South East Asian Muslim consumers are seeking animal based protein in their food rather than plant based protein. Food sourcing from Halal animals and methods are a given criteria in Indonesia and Malaysia. New Zealand has been showing good trading relationships with these markets and has gone extra miles to prove the integrity of Halal processes in the industry. The study’s results brief that there is a great demand for Halal sheep meat and beef products in Indonesia and Malaysia. New Zealand is capable of meeting this demand. However, there are areas {{that need to be addressed}} to improve the profitability to <b>New</b> Zealand <b>exporters,</b> food <b>producers</b> and food manufacturers. This improvement could lead to national economic growth, with SMEs (Small and Medium Sized Enterprises) sharing the benefits of this rapidly growing market. Suggestions are made for further research in the last chapter of this research project...|$|R

In this context, understanding the determinants of duration of <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> is key for underpinning the dynamics of exports growth. As <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> tend to show low survival rates, identifying the determinants of export duration is highly relevant for academic and policy purposes. In this paper, we explore whether information externalities arising from different levels of spatial interaction allow <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> to increase the duration of their trade activities. For this, we use transaction level data on Colombian exports between 2004 and 2011.

40|$|Models {{in which}} {{heterogeneous}} plants face sunk export entry costs are standard {{tools in the}} in-ternational trade literature. How well do these models account for the observed dynamics of <b>new</b> <b>exporters?</b> We document that <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> initially export small amounts and — conditional on continuing in the export market — grow gradually over several years. <b>New</b> <b>exporters</b> {{are most likely to}} exit the export market in their first few years. We construct a dynamic discrete choice model of exporting and find that the standard model cannot replicate the behavior of <b>new</b> ex-porters: <b>New</b> <b>exporters</b> grow too large too quickly and live too long. We assess the quantitative importance of accounting for <b>new</b> <b>exporter</b> dynamics by extending the model to account for these facts. In this model, the present value of exporting falls relative to the baseline model. As a result, the entry costs needed to account for the data are three times smaller than in the baseline model.

40|$|Using transactions-level customs {{data from}} Colombia, we study {{firm-specific}} export patterns {{over the period}} 1996 - 2005. Our data allow us to track firms' entry and exit {{into and out of}} individual destination markets, as well as their revenues from selling there. We find that, in a typical year, nearly half of all Colombian exporters were not exporters in the previous year. These <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> tend to be extremely small in terms of their overall contribution to export revenues, and most do not continue exporting in the following year. Hence export sales are dominated by a small number of very large and stable exporters. Nonetheless, out of each cohort of <b>new</b> <b>exporters,</b> a fraction of firms go on to expand their foreign sales very rapidly, and over the period of less than a decade, these successful <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> account for almost half of total export expansion. Finally, we find that <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> begin in a single foreign market and, if they survive, gradually expand into additional destinations. The geographic expansion paths they follow, and their likelihood of survival as exporters, depend on their initial destination market. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>New</b> <b>exporters</b> add {{and drop}} {{products}} with much greater frequency than old ex-porters. This paper rationalizes this behavior {{with a model}} of demand learning. In the model, an exporter’s profitability on the demand side is determined by a time-invariant firm-destination appeal index, and transient firm-destination-year preference shocks. <b>New</b> <b>exporters</b> must learn about their appeal index {{in the presence of}} these shocks, and respond to fluctuations in demand by adding and dropping products more frequently than older exporters because they have less information about their at-tractiveness to consumers. Calibrated to match cross-section distribution of sales and scope, the model quantitatively accounts for the contribution of the extensive margins to aggregate Brazilian exports. The model predicts that in response to a decline in trade costs existing <b>exporters</b> add <b>new</b> products and <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> enter a destination.

This simplification ignores {{an essential component of}} the export process: how does the decision to export cause firms to alter their supply-chains? In this paper I demonstrate that first-time exporting not only leads to growth in exporter output and productivity, but also influences the supply-chain in three main ways depending on the <b>exporters</b> size. First, <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> replace unproductive suppliers with more productive domestic suppliers. Second, <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> replace existing suppliers with imported alternatives. Third, exporting leads to pecuniary spillovers passed onto domestic suppliers, observed in higher revenue productivity.

40|$|Models of {{heterogenous}} firms {{making decisions}} about entering foreign markets {{in the face of}} sunk entry costs have become standard tools for understanding the firm exporting decision. These models induce a discrete choice between exporting and only serving the domestic market. In this paper we study how well these discrete choice models account for the data on new export entrants. Using Colombian data on manufacturing plants, we document the time paths of new entrants to the export market and find that, though there is a discrete nature to the growth in exports, there is also a substantial amount of adjustment that continues after entry, which is contrary to the standard model. We construct a dynamic discrete choice model of exporting and calibrate it to the Colombian manufacturing sector. We find that the standard heterogeneous firm model cannot replicate the behavior of new exporters; in the model, <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> grow too large, too quickly. The model also cannot generate the downward sloping exit hazard that is evident in the data. We assess the quantitative importance of the slow adjustment of <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> by fitting an export demand function to the data. When the slow growth of <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> is taken into account, the present value of being an exporting firm falls dramatically. As a result, the entry costs needed to account for the data are 8 times smaller than the value in the benchmark model...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature on exporting and firm productivity, focusing on export entry (efficiency), learning (post-entry growth) and exit (inefficiency) by Indian firms. Drawing on 7000 firms during 1989 – 2009, our main objective is to examine the effect of exporting on firm productivity, correcting for selection bias using propensity-score matching, which allows a “like-for-like” comparison between <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> and nonexporters. Robust to different matching estimators, we find evidence of learning-by-exporting that <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> acquire rapid productivity growth after entry, relative to nonexporters. We also find that (1) exporters are more productive than nonexporters; (2) productive firms tend to self-select in entering the exporting market, and (3) least productive exporters are found to exit the export market as they experience adverse productivity effect prior to the year of exit. Our robust result on learning-by-exporting suggests that entering export market does appear to be a channel explaining the Indian recent growth miracle...|$|R

It adds to the literature in four main aspects. First, we find strong evidence of a learning-by-exporting effect for domestic manufacturing firms. Second, the export behaviors of domestic and foreign firms are systematically different. The Chinese domestic firms self-select into the export market with higher productivity ex ante and show a significant learning-by-exporting effect ex post. Foreign exporters do not show significant higher productivity either ex ante or ex post. Third, both domestic and foreign <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> exploit the comparative advantage of China’s low labor cost before exporting, and then strengthen this advantage when exporting. In other words, exporting significantly lowers the capital-labor ratio for the <b>new</b> <b>exporters.</b> Fourth, we find that the learning-by-exporting effect for domestic firms is positively related to their absorptive capacity, in addition to the more usual learning channel through exporting to developed markets...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of a real current account {{adjustment}} on terms of trade, aggregate productivity and welfare-based exchange rate in a two-country general equilibrium model. As in Melitz (2003), firms are heterogeneous in productivity and endogenously enter and exit their domestic and export markets. The real adjustment of the current account leads to the increase of Home exports through the intensive and the extensive margins of trade : incumbent firms export more and <b>new</b> <b>exporters</b> endogenously enter the market. In the benchmark case, the extensive margin of trade accounts for about 19 % of the overall adjustment and the depreciation of the national currency is lower with respect to models where this margin is not considered. In the literature, the change in the terms of trade is lower when goods are more substituable. This common finding is overturned by the endogenous entry of <b>new</b> <b>exporters.</b> For a given dispersion of productivity across firms, a higher elasticity of substitution reduces the role played by the extensive margin on the adjustment and yields a higher depreciation of the exchange rate.
