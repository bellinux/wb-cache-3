In 100 patients with diabetes, preserved left ventricular systolic function, <b>normal</b> <b>filling</b> pressure, and no coronary disease, we measured magnitude of early diastolic tissue lengthening (tissue velocity and strain rate) and diastolic dyssynchrony (SD in QRS to peak early diastolic tissue velocity interval across 4 basal myocardial segments). From transmittal flow patients were divided into those with <b>normal</b> <b>filling</b> (50 patients) and delayed relaxation (50 patients). Myocardial lengthening was reduced and SD in interval from QRS onset to peak early diastolic tissue velocity across all segments was higher in patients with delayed relaxation compared with control patients. Myocardial lengthening was the only predictor of delayed relaxation and correlation with exercise capacity was better for lengthening indices than SD in interval from QRS onset to peak early diastolic tissue velocity across all segments. Therefore, in this group a reduced rate of myocardial lengthening plays a more important role in delayed relaxation than diastolic dyssynchrony...|$|E

It is also well known, that left atrial (LA) dimension {{can be used as a}} marker of DD. In this study we decided to analyze the diagnostic role of new echocardiographic morphofunctional diastolic index (MFDI) in differentiation of <b>normal</b> <b>filling</b> of LV from pseudonormal and restrictive. MFDI includes LA dimension and velocity of early diastolic component ea of RIMS (MFDI = LA/ea). 343 healthy subjects and patients with various cardiac pathology underwent dopplerechocardiographic exam. According to the criteria of "Don " classification scheme 155 subjects had signs of normal LV filling (N) and 55 - of pseudonormal and restrictive filling (PN + R). LA dimension was performed in standard manner. RIMS were registered by conventional pulsed wave Doppler from apical 4 -chamber view, when the sample volume was positioned between the tips of mitral leaflets. The velocity of early diastolic component of RIMS was measured. After calculation of MFDI mean values of this index in two groups (N and PN + R) were compared. The cutoff value of MFDI for differentiation of patients with N and PN + R was determined. Mean value of MFDI in subjects with <b>normal</b> <b>filling</b> was 1. 38 + 0. 33 and in patients with pseudonormal and restrictive filling 2. 43 + 0. 43; p 2. 0 separated subjects with normal LV filling from subjects with pseudonormal and restrictive filling with sensitivity 89. 1 % and specificity 97. 4 %.

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{evaluated}} early diastolic filling dynamics using a semiautomated {{objective analysis}} of filling velocities obtained from color M-mode echocardiography. BackgroundDiastolic function can be evaluated from color M-mode echocardiography {{by measuring the}} early diastolic flow propagation velocity (Vp) from the slope of a single linear approximation of an isovelocity contour. However, this method has limitations and may not accurately represent diastolic filling. MethodsWe used a semiautomated objective analysis of color M-mode echocardiograms from a development cohort of 125 patients with varying diastolic function to quantify left ventricular filling velocities. Early diastolic filling was not accurately described with a single propagation velocity; instead, the rapid initial filling velocity abruptly decelerated to a slower terminal velocity. Then, we evaluated a new measure of diastolic function in a separate group of 160 patients. ResultsCompared with <b>normal</b> <b>filling,</b> diastolic dysfunction with restricted filling had a lower initial velocity (53 ± 21 cm/s vs. 87 ± 29 cm/s, p < 0. 001), and the deceleration point occurred closer to the mitral annulus (2. 4 ± 0. 6 cm vs. 3. 1 ± 0. 7 cm, p < 0. 05). The product of the initial velocity and {{the distance to the}} deceleration point from the mitral annulus, indicating the strength of the early filling (Vs), was progressively reduced with diastolic dysfunction. In a separate validation cohort of 160 patients, Vs better recognized diastolic dysfunction (classified by reduced diastolic intraventricular pressure gradient, elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, or elevated B-type natriuretic peptide) than Vp did. ConclusionsEarly diastolic flow propagation occurs with an initial rapid velocity that abruptly decelerates to a terminal velocity. With diastolic dysfunction, the initial velocity is slower and the deceleration point occurs closer to the mitral annulus than with <b>normal</b> <b>filling.</b> A new parameter that combines these 2 effects (Vs) provides a more accurate assessment of diastolic function than the conventional propagation velocity...|$|E

METHODS: Evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies on (i) signalling pathways like the adenosine triphosphate pathway, cholinergic pathway and nitric oxide and adrenergic pathway, and (ii) different urothelial receptors that are involved in bladder filling signalling like purinergic receptors, sodium channels and TRP channels will be evaluated. Other potential pathways and receptors will also be discussed. RESULTS: Bladder filling results in continuous changes in bladder wall stretch and exposure to urine. Both barrier and afferent signalling functions in the urothelium are constantly adapting to cope with these dynamics. Current evidence shows that the bladder mucosa hosts essential pathways and receptors that mediate bladder filling signalling. Intracellular calcium ion increase is a dominant factor in this signalling process. However, there is still no complete understanding how interacting receptors and pathways create a bladder filling signal. Currently, there are still novel receptors investigated that could also be participating in bladder <b>filling</b> signalling.

BACKGROUNDCombined assessment of DT and Vp allows separation {{of the effects of}} compliance and relaxation on LV filling, thereby allowing identification of pseudonormal filling. This may be valuable after MI, where abnormal LV filling is frequently present. METHODSEchocardiography was performed within 24 h, five days and one and three months after MI in 125 unselected consecutive patients. <b>Normal</b> <b>filling</b> was defined as DT 140 to 240 ms and Vp ≥ 45 cm/s; impaired relaxation as DT ≥ 240 ms; pseudonormal filling as DT 140 to 240 ms and Vp < 45 cm/s; and restrictive filling as DT < 140 ms. RESULTSLeft ventricular filling was normal in 38 patients; impaired relaxation in 38; pseudonormal in 23; and restrictive in 26. End-systolic and end-diastolic volume indexes were significantly increased during the first three months after MI in patients with pseudonormal or restrictive filling (37 ± 15 vs. 47 ± 19 ml/m 2, p < 0. 0005 and 71 ± 20 vs. 88 ± 24 ml/m 2, p < 0. 0005, respectively). During a follow-up period of 12 ± 7 months, 33 patients died. Mortality was significantly higher in patients with impaired relaxation (p = 0. 02), pseudonormal filling (p < 0. 00005) and restrictive filling (p < 0. 00005), compared with patients with <b>normal</b> <b>filling.</b> On Cox analysis, restrictive filling (p = 0. 003), pseudonormal filling (p = 0. 006) and Killip class ≥II (p = 0. 008) independently predicted cardiac death, compared with clinical and echocardiographic variables.

30|$|We {{were unable}} to {{demonstrate}} an association between the occurrence of NOSVA and septic myocardial dysfunction, as assessed by LVEF. Several explanations are possible. First, LVEF {{may not be the}} ideal criterion to assess septic cardiomyopathy, notably because of its load-dependency. However, evaluation of cardiac function in our patients was done after fluid loading and while receiving vasoconstrictors. Whether echocardiographic parameters less dependent on afterload, such as speckle tracking derived strain-rate, may better characterize septic cardiomyopathy warrants further research. Second, the mechanisms of septic myocardial dysfunction and substrates/triggers of SVA may differ. Septic cardiomyopathy mainly affects heart ventricles, with depressed contractility and low or <b>normal</b> <b>filling</b> pressures [6], whereas SVA is an atrial disorder that is mainly influenced by atrial pressure and autonomous nervous system tone. Cardiac biomarkers (B-type natriuretic peptides and troponins), which are mainly released from the ventricular myocytes and mostly influenced by left ventricle function and mass, were not significantly associated with SVA in our series despite a trend towards higher values in the NOSVA group.|$|E
