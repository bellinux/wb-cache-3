5|$|A {{previous}} {{analysis by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos of commensurabilities among the known ETNOs using Monte Carlo techniques revealed a pattern {{similar to that}} of the Kuiper belt, where accidental commensurabilities occur due to objects in resonances with Neptune. They find that this pattern would be best explained if the ETNOs were in resonance with an additional planetary-sized object beyond Pluto and <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> number of these objects may be in 5:3 and 3:1 resonances if that object had semi-major axis of ≈700 AU.|$|E

5|$|Core-collapse {{is thought}} to occur when the more massive stars in a {{globular}} cluster encounter their less massive companions. Over time, dynamic processes cause individual stars to migrate {{from the center of}} the cluster to the outside. This results in a net loss of kinetic energy from the core region, leading the remaining stars grouped in the core region to occupy a more compact volume. When this gravothermal instability occurs, the central region of the cluster becomes densely crowded with stars and the surface brightness of the cluster forms a power-law cusp. (<b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> core collapse is not the only mechanism that can cause such a luminosity distribution; a massive black hole at the core can also result in a luminosity cusp.) Over a lengthy period of time this leads to a concentration of massive stars near the core, a phenomenon called mass segregation.|$|E
5|$|Lions are {{the most}} {{socially}} inclined of all wild felids, most of which remain quite solitary in nature, and have two types of social organisation. Some lions are residents, living in groups of related lionesses, their mates, and offspring. Such a group is called a pride. Females form the stable social unit in a pride and do not tolerate outside females. Membership only changes with the births and deaths of lionesses, although some females do leave and become nomadic. Although extremely large prides, consisting of up over 30 individuals, have been observed, the average pride consists of around fifteen lions; including several adult females, up to four males (known as a coalition if more than one) and their cubs of both sexes. The sole exception to this pattern is the Tsavo lion pride which always has just one adult male. Male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity at around 2–3 years of age. The second organisational behaviour is labeled nomads, who range widely and move about sporadically, either singularly or in pairs. Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth pride. <b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> lion may switch lifestyles; nomads may become residents and vice versa. Interactions between prides and nomads tend to be hostile, although pride females in estrous may allow nomad males to approach them.|$|E
