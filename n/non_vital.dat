The life tables were constructed using the Chiang Method based on the adjusted data on deaths and population by age and sex from the Indian Registry, maintained by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Government of Canada. The data on the register are subjected to late reported and <b>non</b> reported <b>vital</b> events. At the Canada level, life expectancy at birth for Registered Indian males was 59. 9 years in 1976 - 1980, rising to 68. 3 years in 1996 - 2000. For females, the life expectancy at birth was relatively higher, 66. 6 years in 1976 - 80, and 74. 5 years in 1996 - 2000. The recent life expectancies at birth for Registered Indians are comparable to those observed for the total Canadian male and female populations during the period 1960 - 1962 at 68. 4 and 74. 3 years. In 1999, life expectancy at birth for the total Canadian population {{was reported to be}} 76. 3 years for males and 81. 7 years for females.

40|$|The {{management}} of <b>non</b> <b>vital</b> anterior permanent teeth in {{children is a}} challenge for the clinicians.

40|$|The dental {{practitioner}} {{is provided with}} a variety of post endodontic treatment options which range from invasive methods like full veneer crowns to least invasive and aesthetic procedures like bleaching. The most important parameter in non-vital bleaching is the placement of a barrier to prevent the resorption of the tooth which has a poor prognosis. The aim of this paper was to report a case of successful non-vital bleaching by using mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) as a barrier, with follow up reports of two years. This article describes a one year follow up of a case of <b>non</b> <b>vital</b> bleaching which was performed on a root canal treated, discoloured, maxillary central incisor. By using mineral trioxide aggregate as a barrier, a mixture of sodium perborate and distilled water was used as the bleaching agent.

40|$|Objectives: The {{present study}} is aimed at {{evaluating}} the long-term color stability of endodontically-treated teeth which {{have been subjected to}} in-office and the walking bleach treatment with carbamide peroxide. Methods and Materials: Sixty patients in need of dental bleaching following endodontic treatment were selected for the study. After endodontic treatment, the patients were subjected to in-office dental bleaching and the walking bleach technique with 10 % carbamide peroxide. A color shade score was given to each patient before and after the bleaching procedures and at the final follow-up. Data were statistically analyzed. Results: At the 21 -year follow-up, 42 out of 60 patients were eligible for the retrospective evaluation. Failures were noticed in 9 patients showing a color mismatch of two or more shades in comparison with adjacent teeth. A success rate of 78. 6 % was reported. The statistical analyses showed significant differences between Baseline vs End of Treatment and Baseline vs Follow-Up (p 0. 05). The endodontic treatment failed in 3 patients. Discussion: The null hypothesis was rejected. The bleaching effect of carbamide peroxide in <b>non</b> <b>vital</b> teeth proved to be stable and reliable in the long-term. The clinical observations performed in the present investigation are consistent with the results of previous studies. No chronic sensitivity was observed in any patient. Although no root resorption was observed, few root fractures were noticed and the detrimental effects of peroxide on dental hard tissue may have contributed to such failures. Conclusions: Carbamide peroxide proved to be an effective dental whitening agent in the long-term for endodontically-treated teeth with both in-office and walking bleach techniques. Moreover, the vertical condensation technique of warm guttapercha {{did not seem to be}} affected by the intra-coronal application of carbamide peroxide.

The purpose of the present case was to report an occurrence of BRONJ after implant insertion. Case report: Ten years ago, eight dental implants were inserted in the jaw of a 65 -year-old female. After 5 years of treatment with alendronic acid, a breakdown of the oral mucosa covering the implants occurred with a purulent discharge in the left side of the jaw; periapical radiolucency was present around both distal implants. An en-block resection of the alveolar bone including the two implants was performed. Thirthy-five hyperbaric sessions were taken and no signs of recurrence of the lesion were observed after a follow-up of 20 months. Before the new implant insertion, the patient had suspended the treatment with alendronic acid for 6 months. At the interface of one of the implants, a gap was observed between bone and implant.

Methods and Materials: Seventy single canal anterior teeth were chosen by simple randomization. After access cavity preparation, the canals were cleaned and shaped. Five teeth were used as positive control and five as negative control. Other sixty teeth were filled with gutta-percha and sealer using lateral condensation method. In the next step, 3 mm of gutta percha was removed from the coronal part and a thickness of 2 mm of one of the materials (GI, Super EBA, MTA) was placed as coronal plug. Then the teeth were bleached 3 times with an interval of 72 h, using Sodium Perborate and 3 % H 2 O 2. Then the access cavities were completely cleaned and filled with 2 % methylene blue for 24 h. The sample teeth were washed, dried and sectioned and dye penetration was measured using magnifying glass and cullies. Data was analyzed by ANOVA and LSD tests.

An 11 year old boy with the history of trauma was diagnosed with the pulpal necrosis and symptomatic apical periodontitis in tooth # 21. Intra oral periapical radiograph showed open apex and associated immature supernumerary tooth with respect to tooth # 21. Access preparation and minimal instrumentation was done to remove necrotic debris under copious irrigation with 2. 5 % sodium hypochlorite. Triple antibiotic paste was packed in the canal for four weeks. During second visit, 5 mL of whole blood was drawn from the medial cubital vein of the patient and blood was then subjected to centrifugation at 2400 rpm for 12 minutes for the preparation of Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) utilizing Choukroun′s method. Triple antibiotic paste was removed and canal was dried. PRF clot was pushed to the apical region of tooth # 21 using hand pluggers.

40|$|John von Neumann first {{presented}} {{his theory of}} machine self reproduction in the late 1940 's in which he described a machine capable of performing the logical steps necessary to accommodate self reproduction, and provided an explanation in principle for how arbitrarily complex machines can construct other (offspring) machines of equal or even greater complexity. In this thesis, a machine having the von Neumann architecture for self reproduction is designed to operate within the computational world of Tierra. This design implements a (mutable) genotype-phenotype mapping during reproduction, and acts as an exploratory model to observe the phenomena which may arise with such a system. A substitution mapping was chosen {{to carry out the}} genotype-phenotype mapping, and two specific implementations of a substitution mapping were investigated, via the use of a look-up table and a translation table. During implementation of the look-up table, preliminary experiments showed a degeneration to self copiers where a lineage of von Neumann style self reproducers degenerated into self copiers. Further experiments showed that a particular phenomenon emerges, where "pathological constructors" quickly develop, which can ultimately lead to total ecosystem collapse. If redundancy is introduced to the genotype-phenotype mapping, certain inheritable perturbations (mutations) prove to be non-reversible via a change to the genotype, which leads to a bias {{in the evolution of the}} genotype-phenotype mapping, consistently resulting in the loss of any target symbols from the mapping which are not vital for reproduction. It demonstrated how instances of Lamarkian inheritance may occur, which allowed these genetically "non-reversible" perturbations to be reversed, but only when accompanied by a very specific perturbation to the phenotype. The underlying dynamics of the chosen coding system was studied in order to better understand why these phenomena occur. When implementing a translation table, the space of possible mutations to the genotype-phenotype mapping was investigated and the same phenomena observed, where <b>non</b> <b>vital</b> symbols were lost from the mapping, and an instance of Lamarkian inheritance is necessary in order to introduce symbols to the mapping. ...|$|E

Recent researches have shown that reciprocating instrumentation techniques seem to significantly increase the amount of debris extruded beyond the apex and, consequently, the risk of postoperative pain. The goal {{of the present study was}} to evaluate and compare postoperative pain using three different nickel-titanium instrumentation techniques: a rotary crown-down technique using TF instruments (SybronEndo, Orange, Ca), a reciprocating single-file technique using WaveOne instruments (Maillefer DEntsply, Baillagues, CH), and a novel instrumentation technique (TF Adaptive, SybronEndo, Orange, Ca), using a unique, proprietary movement, combining reciprocation and continuous rotation. Ninety patients requiring endodontic treatment on permanent premolar and molar teeth with <b>non</b> <b>vital</b> pulps preoperatively were included in the study. The patients were assigned into three groups of 30 patients each, trying to make the groups very similar, concerning the number of root canals, presence of initial pain and periapical lesions.

The third group (n = 30) used the 3 -file Tf Adaprtive sequence. All techniques were performed following manufacturers' instructions and all canals were shaped, cleaned and obturated in a single-visit by the same operator. The assessment of postoperative pain was carried out at 3 days by using a visual analogue scale. VAS pain scores were compared using one-way ANOVA post hoc Tukey test. A value of p < 0. 05 was required for statistical significance. Results for VAS pain scores showed a statistically significant difference was found between the WaveOne (p= 0, 021) technique and the other two techniques. No statistical significant differences were found between TF and TF Adaptive (p= 0, 087). When evaluating patient experiencing sever pain the incidence of symptoms was significantly higher with the WaveOne technique. Since the incidence of preoperative pain, the type of tooth and the pulp and periodontal pathology were quite similar between the three tested groups, and all the other variables (operator, irrigation, obturation) were identical, we may conclude that the difference in postoperative pain can be mainly related to the different instrumentation techniques...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar in vivo, a confiabilidade do localizador eletrônico Bingo, na determinação do comprimento de trabalho, em situações de polpa vital e necrosada. Foram {{realizadas}} 56 aferições eletrônicas em pacientes entre 15 e 65 anos de idade, em tratamento na Disciplina de Endodontia da Universidade Luterana do Brasil (ULBRA – Canoas/RS). Dos dentes estudados, 25 possuíam canais com polpas vitais e 31, com polpa necrosada. Após isolamento absoluto e abertura coronária, estando a alça labial devidamente posicionada, introduziu-se, no interior do canal radicular, uma lima endodôntica de 25 ou 31 mm conectada a um dos pólos do aparelho, de diâmetro compatível com a anatomia do terço apical. Quando o visor do localizador eletrônico acusava estar a ponta do instrumento a 1 mm da saída foraminal, os dentes foram radiografados. Com o auxílio de uma lupa, régua milimetrada e negatoscópio, foi mensurada, na radiografia, a distância entre a ponta do instrumento e o vértice radiográfico. Medidas compreendidas entre 0, 5 mm e 1, 5 mm foram consideradas confiáveis. Os resultados obtidos mostraram índice de confiabilidade de 92 % para dentes com polpa viva e 83, 87 % para dentes com polpa mortificada. O localizador apical Bingo constitui-se em um excelente recurso auxiliar na odontometria, quando corretamente empregado. The aim of {{this study}} was to determine, in vivo, the ability of Bingo electronic apex locator to determine root length in vital and <b>non</b> <b>vital</b> teeth. For this purpose, 56 measurements were proceeded in patients aging 15 to 65 years, undergoing treatment at the Endodontics Discipline of the Brazilian Lutheran University (ULBRA – Canoas/RS). The teeth comprised of 25 vital pulp root canals and 31 with necrotic pulps. Following rubber dam placement and access cavity, with the liphook adequately positioned, a # 25 to 31 K-file, connected to the Bingo device was placed within the root canal. The file diameter was compatible to the canal at the root apex. When the screen would denote the file to be 1 mm short of the apex, radiographs were taken. With the help of magnifying lenses and a ruler, the distance between the tip of the instrument and the radiographic vertex was measured. Values between 0. 5 and 1. 5 mm were considered adequate. The results showed 92 % of measurements within the adequate limits in teeth with vital pulps and 83. 87 % in cases of necrotic pulps. Bingo apex locator was considered an axcelent means to help root length determination, when used adequately...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringBalasubramaniam NatarajanCaterina ScoglioMany {{physical}} and engineered systems (e. g., smart grid, transportation and biomedical systems) {{are increasingly being}} monitored and controlled over a communication network. These systems where sensing, communication, computation and real time control are closely integrated {{are referred to as}} cyber physical systems (CPS). Cyber physical systems present a plethora of challenges related to their design, analysis, optimization and control. In this dissertation, we present some fundamental methodologies to analyze the optimization of physical systems over a communication network. Specifically, we consider a medium voltage DC shipboard smart grid (SSG) reconfiguration problem as a test case to demonstrate our approach. The main goal of SSG reconfiguration is to change the topology of the physical power system by switching circuit breakers, switches, and other devices in the system in order to route power effectively to loads especially in the event of faults/failures. A majority of the prior work has focused on centralized approaches to optimize the switch configuration to maximize specific objectives. These methods are prohibitively complex and not suited for agile reconfiguration in mission critical situations. Decentralized solutions proposed do reduce complexity and implementation time at the cost of optimality. Unfortunately, none of the prior efforts in this arena address the cyber physical aspects of an SSG. This dissertation aims to bridge this gap by proposing a suite of methods to analyze both centralized and decentralized SSG reconfigurations that incorporate the effect of the underlying cyber infrastructure. The SSG reconfiguration problem is a mixed integer non convex optimization problem for which branch and bound based solutions have been proposed earlier. Here, optimal reconfiguration strategies prioritize the power delivered to vital loads over semi-vital and <b>non</b> <b>vital</b> loads. In this work, we propose a convex approximation to the original non convex problem that significantly reduces complexity of the SSG reconfiguration. Tradeoff between power delivered and number of switching operations after reconfiguration is discussed at steady state. Second, the distribution of end-to-end delay associated with fault diagnosis and reconfiguration in SSG is investigated from a cyber-physical system perspective. Specifically, a cross-layer total (end-to-end) delay analysis framework is introduced for SSG reconfiguration. The proposed framework stochastically models the heterogeneity of actions of various sub-systems viz., the reconfiguration of power systems, generation of fault information by sensor nodes associated to the power system, processing actions at control center to resolve fault locations and reconfiguration, and information flow through communication network to:(1) analyze the distribution of total delay in SSG reconfiguration after the occurrence of faults; and (2) propose design options for real-time reconfiguration solutions for shipboard CPS, that meet total delay requirements. Finally, the dissertation focuses on the quality of SSG reconfiguration solution with incomplete knowledge of the overall system state, and communication costs that may affect the quality (optimality) of the resulting reconfiguration. A dual decomposition based decentralized optimization in which the shipboard system is decomposed into multiple separable subsystems with agents is proposed. Specifically, agents monitoring each subsystem solve a local concave dual function of the original objective while neighboring agents share information over a communication network to obtain a global solution. The convergence of the proposed approach under varying network delays and quantization noise is analyzed and comparisons with centralized approaches are presented. Results demonstrate the effectiveness as well as tradeoffs involved in centralized and decentralized SSG reconfiguration approaches...|$|E
