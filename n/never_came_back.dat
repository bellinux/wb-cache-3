5|$|After {{getting off}} the bed, the Hero is then given a task to get a crown in {{preparation}} for the annual Mountain Spirit festival from the elder which takes him to Haggleton. However he finds out the man that is supposed to make the crown has gone out somewhere to the northwest of town and <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>back.</b> The hero then heads in that direction and finds a large hole with the crown maker just barely hanging on. The hero attempts to rescue him and succeeds but in the process, slips and falls to the world below. In this mysterious world, the hero finds a nearby town in which the townspeople cannot see him. The hero grabs a tip from one of the townspeople that there's a special well to the north which people went in never came back; thus the hero heads in that direction and returns to his world.|$|E
5|$|During {{their time}} in captivity, men from the 2/18th {{undertook}} a number of subversive activities including building a radio transmitter, which they used to contact local resistance groups who provided them with assistance {{in the form of}} medicine and intelligence. They were also involved in numerous escape attempts, some of which were successful, alongside Australians from other units. One of these successful escapes involved a group of eight men who escaped from the camp on Berhala Island in two groups. One group escaped while out of camp on a work detail, while the other simply walked out the front gate to use the ablutions and <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>back.</b> After meeting up outside the camp, the men split up again. One group included Lieutenant Charles Wagner, who had previously been decorated with the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions around the Nithsdale Estate and who had been commissioned in the field. Having bribed one of the camp guards, Wagner's group had contacted the local guerillas and arranged to rendezvous with a fishing vessel. After hiding out for three weeks, the vessel eventually arrived offshore and took them on board. The group then met up with the other escapees on Tawi-Tawi where in mid-1943 they began working with the Filipino guerilla forces, fighting alongside them {{until the end of the}} war. Other escapes occurred later in the war, including one in which five men escaped from Ranau over the course of two days in early July 1945 during one of the death marches. After effecting their escape, these men were helped by locals who provided food and information, before the men were able to meet up with some Australians from Z Special Unit.|$|E

Perks' tireless fast-medium bowling was considered an important part of Worcestershire's rise to third in the County Championship in 1949 and fourth in 1951.|$|E

25|$|Through bribes and threats, he {{eventually}} {{managed to get}} a permission to go to Slovenia for himself and twenty close companions. From there the group moved through Austria and Germany before finally relocating to Liège, Belgium. Although Prazina settled himself and his followers in a neighborhood populated mostly by immigrants from Turkey and the Maghreb, {{he eventually}} established himself among the city's small Yugoslav emigrant community. There, Prazina was last seen the night of 3 December 1993. He went out with his bodyguards after a game of cards and <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>back.</b> The next morning, German police found his Audi abandoned at the railroad station in Aachen. The car body had two bullet holes from a 9mm handgun; presumed to be a Beretta. Prazina's body was discovered in a canal alongside a highway near the German border by two Romanian hitch-hikers on New Year's Eve. The bullets found in Prazina's head corresponded to the holes in his car, and the ownership of a Beretta by one of his bodyguards sealed the case in the eyes of Belgian police. The four bodyguards were arrested, and three of them went on to be tried and sentenced to serve time in prison.|$|E

500|$|Once the frivolities had ended, minds {{turned to}} post-war policy, and {{particularly}} how soldiers returning from Europe would be reintegrated into society. The Company had already, in 1916, set aside [...] of farmland {{to be given}} free of charge to white war veterans. In early 1919 it set up a government department to help returning men find work. Many former soldiers failed to find jobs, and some remained unemployed for years after they returned home. Some of the more seriously wounded from the European theatre <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> at all, instead remaining in England because of the better medical facilities and public benefits.

500|$|On April 10, 1834, a fire {{broke out}} in the LaLaurie {{residence}} on Royal Street, starting in the kitchen. [...] When the police and fire marshals got there, they found a seventy-year-old woman, the cook, chained to the stove by her ankle. [...] She later confessed to them that she had set the fire as a suicide attempt for fear of her punishment, being taken to the uppermost room, because she said that anyone who was taken there <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>back.</b> [...] As reported in the New Orleans Bee of April 11, 1834, bystanders responding to the fire attempted to enter the slave quarters to ensure that everyone had been evacuated. [...] Upon being refused the keys by the LaLauries, the bystanders broke down the doors to the slave quarters and found [...] "seven slaves, more or less horribly mutilated... suspended by the neck, with their limbs apparently stretched and torn from one extremity to the other", who claimed to have been imprisoned there for some months.|$|E

She wore a small plaid crossed over shawl pinned with a silver brooch, a bed jacket, and a full kilted petticoat. She dropped bob curtsies, but she was outspoken and very independent, proud and proper ... The joy of converse with old Katie was to draw her out {{to talk of the}} days when she was a wee bit lassie—herding the kine.

Some jumped ship and <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>back.</b> The lesson: Pay off our expectations, or you'll be sorry." [...] Jim Minge of the Omaha World-Herald said South Park fans were [...] "duped" [...] by the episode. Philip Martin of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, who said in May 1998 the South Park phenomenon was [...] "dead", described the April Fools' prank as [...] "lamentable" [...] {{and part of the}} reason for the show's apparent decline. Others, however, praised Parker and Stone for making the move at the risk of upsetting fans. Tim Clodfelter of the Winston-Salem Journal said, [...] "It was a funny, clever move [...] quickly separated the fans who truly [...] "got" [...] humor from those who were just watching for the dirty jokes." [...] Jon Casimir of The Sydney Morning Herald said, [...] "It is gratifying, in an entertainment world dominated by market research and common denominators, to see a program that obviously doesn't care if you like it or not." [...] However, he said the characterization of Terrance and Phillip was too thin to be particularly funny, and added that the novelty of the prank is lost in later years.|$|E
