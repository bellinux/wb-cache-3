40|$|In {{this work}} we {{develop a new}} {{spectrophotometer}} system for measuring thermal radiation characteristics of real surfaces of thermal engineering entirely. This system measures transition of spectra of normal incidence hemispherical reflectance R_, normal incidence specular reflectance R_, normal incidence diffuse reflectance R_, <b>normal</b> <b>absorptance</b> A_N and normal emittance ε_N of real surfaces in a near-ultraviolet through infrared region of wavelength 0. 30 〜 11 μm simultaneously and repeatedly with a cycle time of 6 s. The system is applied to measure the spectrum transition of the reflectances, absorptance and emittance of a nickel surface which is prepared as a clean optically smooth surface and is oxidized in high-temperature air to be changed to an oxidized rough real surface. Microscopic mechanisms of the spectrum transition are discussed, to illustrate {{the ability of the}} developed spectrophotometer system for thermal engineering...|$|E
40|$|In this work, a {{selective}} solar absorber made of nanostructured titanium gratings deposited on an ultrathin MgF 2 spacer and a tungsten ground film is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. <b>Normal</b> <b>absorptance</b> of the fabricated solar absorber is characterized {{to be higher}} than 0. 9 in the UV, visible and, near infrared (IR) regime, while the mid-IR emittance is around 0. 2. The high broadband absorption in the solar spectrum is realized by the excitation of surface plasmon and magnetic polariton resonances, while the low mid-IR emittance is due to the highly reflective nature of the metallic components. Further directional and polarized reflectance measurements show wide-angle and polarization-insensitive high absorption within solar spectrum. Temperature-dependent spectroscopic characterization indicates that the optical properties barely change at elevated temperatures up to 350 C. The solar-to-heat conversion efficiency with the fabricated metamaterial solar absorber is predicted to be 78 % at 100 C without optical concentration or 80 % at 400 C with 25 suns. The performance could be further improved with better fabrication processes and geometric optimization during metamaterial design. The strong spectral selectivity, favorable diffuse-like behavior, and good thermal stability make the metamaterial selective absorber promising for significantly enhancing solar thermal energy harvesting in various systems at mid to high temperatures...|$|E
40|$|A new {{spectrophotometer}} {{system is}} {{developed for the}} study of thermal radiation characteristics of real surfaces in thermal engineering environments. The system measures spectra of normal incidence hemispherical reflectance RNH and normal emittance EN in the near-ultraviolet through infrared region of wavelength of 0. 30 μm to 11 μm simultaneously and repeatedly with a cycle time of 4 s. The system enables evaluation of the <b>normal</b> incidence <b>absorptance</b> AN in this wide spectral region. Transitions of spectra of specular-finished and rough-finished nickel surfaces in a high-temperature air-oxidation process are measured to demonstrate the performance of the system.

40|$|AbstractTo {{support the}} fast growth of Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) technologies, R&D efforts {{need to be}} {{continued}} to minimize costs. Reducing manufacturing, processing and maintenance costs is key to reach a competitive low production price for electricity. From this perspective, one issue that becomes increasingly significant is the service lifetime of solar absorber materials. In solar tower receivers, absorber materials are subjected to very intense solar flux and cyclic thermal stresses. The chemical and physical aging mechanisms such as corrosion and oxidation, or the possible apparition of cracks or delamination {{are responsible for the}} change of the material's surface and bulk properties over time. This causes the thermal performance of the material to decline more or less rapidly. Taking a two-layer solar absorber material (metal + coating) that is commonly used in power tower receivers (SOLAR TWO, GEMASOLAR, SOLHYCO), we have designed several accelerated aging tests by analyzing the thermal behavior of the material in permanent and variable regimes. The experimental tests consist in subjecting the material to cyclic irradiance of variable intensity, amplitude and period to determine the fastest and most realistic tests. A Solar Accelerated Aging Facility (SAAF) was built for this purpose. It is made of a 2 -meter diameter parabola concentrating the solar radiation (up to 16, 000 times) onto a material sample that is cooled by air or water in direct contact with its rear face. A flux sensor coupled to a shutter allows us to apply the desired solar irradiance while an infrared pyrometer monitors surface temperature of the sample. Following different constant-irradiance solar aging treatments, the properties that are characteristic of the aging are estimated. The <b>normal</b> solar <b>absorptance</b> of each sample is evaluated by a solar optical fiber reflectometer. The thermophysical properties of the paint such as the thermal diffusivity, effusivity, conductivity and the thermal contact resistance between the paint layer and the metal substrate are estimated by inverse method using the measurements of an impulse photothermal experiment. In addition, untreated samples are characterized in order to provide rare data on the ‘not aged’ material. Careful attention should be paid to the preliminary vitrification heat treatment carried out to give the black paint its optimal absorption properties before being used. The results of the aging tests show a slight deterioration of the properties corresponding to the first aging signs of the material. The solar absorptance and the thermal effusivity of the paint coating are the most affected properties during the tests...|$|R
