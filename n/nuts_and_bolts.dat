5|$|Atherton, {{along with}} {{neighbouring}} Shakerley, {{was associated with}} coal mining and nail manufacture. Alexander Naylor was taxed on his goods in 1332, showing the industry was present for at least 600years. Encouraged by the proximity of outcrops of coal, iron was brought from Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Spain. A variety of nails were made, lath nails, slate nails, thatching nails and sparrowbills. The nail smithies manufactured ploughs and scythes; their products were taken by pack horse to be sold in Manchester, Denbigh, Clitheroe and Kendal. The nail industry developed into the manufacture of <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolts.</b> Thomas Blakemore {{was the first in}} 1843 and by 1853 there were eight makers of <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> including James Prestwich and Robert Parker. Some manufacturers of <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> made spindles and flyers for spinning machinery. Collier Brook Bolt Works on Bag Lane dating from 1856 survives and is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|Do-Ashiayana Manzil was a {{portable}} wooden house {{used by the}} Mughal emperors during their visits outside their capital. This was a double storied house built with a platform supported over 16 pillars, of 6 yards height. Pillars were 4 cubits in height joined with <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> which formed the upper floor. This functioned as a sleeping quarter for the king and also for worship and holding Jharokha Darshan, and considered it an emulation of Hindu practice.|$|E
5|$|On 26 February, {{an interim}} report {{published}} by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch outlined the current progress of the investigation. The report contained a single conclusion, that the immediate cause of the accident was {{the condition of the}} stretcher bar arrangement at points 2B at Lambrigg crossover, which resulted in the loss of gauge separation of the point switch blades. The stretcher bars (components that hold the moving blades of the points the correct distance apart) had been found to be disconnected or missing. Of the three bars, one was not in position, another had <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> missing, and two were fractured. The points in question were facing the direction of travel of the train.|$|E

25|$|In short, {{oxy-fuel}} {{equipment is}} quite versatile, {{not only because}} it is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding but also because it lends itself to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), rust or scale removal, the loosening of corroded <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolts,</b> and is a ubiquitous means of cutting ferrous metals.|$|E
25|$|A socket wrench, more {{commonly}} referred to as a ratchet, is a type of wrench, or tightening tool, that uses separate, removable sockets to fit many different sizes of fittings and fasteners, most commonly <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolts.</b> The ratchet wrench was invented by J.J. Richardson of Woodstock, Vermont, receiving a patent for the ratchet wrench from the Scientific American Patent Agency on June 18, 1863.|$|E
40|$|There is {{constant}} research {{going on in}} the field of recognition by means of artificial intelligence to enhance the productivity. The automotive industry requires an automated system to sort different sizes <b>and</b> shapes <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolt</b> which are the mainly used component in the industry, to improve the overall productivity. This review paper deals with some feature extraction techniques and its performance impact on the artificial neural network efficiency for the recognition of <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolt.</b> The main feature extraction techniques analysed for this review paper are stationary wavelet transform, principle component analysis and radius analysis. The aforementioned techniques are already tested and simulation is done on MATLAB. The results obtained varies depending on pre-processing techniques used for the <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolt</b> recognition...|$|R

25|$|Therefore, for {{the first}} metamaterial, the <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> are one split-ring {{resonator}} electromagnetically combined with one (electric) conducting post. These are designed to resonate at designated frequencies to achieve the desired values. Looking at the make-up of the split ring, the associated magnetic field pattern from the SRR is dipolar. This dipolar behavior is notable because this means it mimics nature's atom, but on a much larger scale, such as in this case at 2.5 millimeters. Atoms exist {{on the scale of}} picometers.|$|E
25|$|Meccano {{was a model}} {{construction}} system that consisted of re-usable metal strips, plates, angle girders, wheels, axles and gears, with <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> to connect the pieces and enabled the building of working models and mechanical devices. Dinky Toys pioneered the manufacture of die-cast toys with the production of toy cars, trains and ships and model train sets became popular in the 1920s. The Britain's company revolutionized the production of toy soldiers with {{the invention of the}} process of hollow casting in lead in 1893 – the company's products remained the industry standard for many years.|$|E
25|$|After graduation, Winick {{lived in}} an {{apartment}} in Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts, with fellow writer Brad Meltzer, struggling to develop <b>Nuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Bolts</b> for UPS, while working at a bookstore. On January 1, 1993, UPS decided not to renew Winick’s strip for syndication, feeling it could not compete in the current market. Winick was unable to secure syndication with another company, {{and was forced to}} move back in with his parents by the middle of 1993, doing unfulfilling T-shirt work for beer companies. Winick had Nuts & Bolts in development with the children’s television network Nickelodeon as an animated series, even turning the human characters into mice, and proposing new titles like Young Urban Mice and Rat Race, but nothing came of it.|$|E

Further investigation of the bodies revealed that they received cuts from pieces of steel from the box in which the bomb was placed. Another new source claimed that the mastermind of the Ashura blast was arrested 10 days before the attack by the police. The source also claims that police had managed to hide the arrest and the knowledge thereof. During interrogation, perpetrator Sirajullah using the alias Zeeshan, revealed all the details of the attack, including planning and details of the explosives to be used.

Matt Rhodes, writing for Consequence of Sound, reviewed the album positively, stating that [...] "frankly, this album sounds like dark, kinky sex". Rhodes compared it to the works of Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin, and felt that Denison's guitar parts served to specifically compliment Patton's vocals, rather than attempting to stand out for themselves. Tom Mallon of CMJ New Music Monthly felt that the album presented a more cohesive group than was present on Tomahawk, allowing the band to [...] " [...] out of the shadows" [...] of their previous careers.

500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by noted horror author Stephen King. King {{initially}} approached series co-star David Duchovny and {{informed him that}} he loved the show and desired to write an episode. Eventually, he called series creator Chris Carter and expressed his desire to write an episode of Millennium instead. Carter agreed, but once more, King {{changed his mind and}} it was decided that he would write an episode of The X-Files. King sent various drafts to Carter from his home in Maine; the two individuals never actually met one another. King's original story had some issues that Carter rewrote. Carter explained, [...] "Stephen wasn't used to writing for Mulder and Scully [...] the Mulder-and-Scully story in his original draft didn't quite work". Carter separated Mulder and Scully in the finalized draft and helped to finalize the script, hence their dual writing credit on the episode. Kim Manners, the director for the episode, later said, [...] "I was very excited to be able to direct a Stephen King piece, and when it was all said and done, there was very little Stephen King left in it. The <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> were his, but that was really one of Chris' scripts." [...] Unbeknownst to either Carter or King, the word [...] "Chinga" [...] can be considered a vulgar Spanish colloquialism.|$|E
