The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times; fragments of cotton fabric dated from 5000 BC have been excavated in Mexico and between 6000 BC and 5000 BC in the Indus Valley Civilization.

25|$|The bharal or blue sheep is {{the most}} {{abundant}} mountain ungulate in the Ladakh region, {{although it is not}} found in some parts of Zangskar and Sham areas. The Asiatic ibex is a very elegant mountain goat that is distributed {{in the western part of}} Ladakh. It is the second most abundant mountain ungulate in the region with a population of about 6000 individuals. It is adapted to rugged areas where it easily climbs when threatened. The Ladakhi Urial is another unique mountain sheep that inhabits the mountains of Ladakh. The population is declining, however, and there are not more than 3000 individuals left in Ladakh. The urial is endemic to Ladakh, where it is distributed only along two major river valleys: the Indus and Shayok. The animal is often persecuted by farmers whose crops are allegedly damaged by it. Its population declined precipitously in the last century due to indiscriminate shooting by hunters along the Leh-Srinagar highway. The Tibetan argali or Nyan is the largest wild sheep in the world, standing 3.5 to 4 feet at the shoulder with the horn measuring 90–100cm. It is distributed on the Tibetan plateau and its marginal mountains encompassing a total area of 2.5 million km2. There is only a small population of about 400 animals in Ladakh. The animal prefers open and rolling terrain as it runs, unlike wild goats that climb into steep cliffs, to escape from predators. The endangered Tibetan antelope, known as chiru in Indian English, or Ladakhi tsos, has traditionally been hunted for its wool (shahtoosh) which is a <b>natural</b> <b>fiber</b> of the finest quality and thus valued for its light weight and warmth and as a status symbol. The wool of chiru must be pulled out by hand, a process done after the animal is killed. The fiber is smuggled into Kashmir and woven into exquisite shawls by Kashmiri workers. Ladakh is also home to the Tibetan gazelle, which inhabits the vast rangelands in eastern Ladakh bordering Tibet.|$|E
2500|$|Alpaca fleece is the <b>natural</b> <b>fiber</b> {{harvested}} from an alpaca. It is light or heavy in weight, {{depending on how}} it is spun. It is a soft, durable, luxurious [...] and silky <b>natural</b> <b>fiber.</b> While similar to sheep’s wool, it is warmer, not prickly, and has no lanolin, which makes it hypoallergenic. Alpaca is naturally water-repellent and difficult to ignite. Huacaya, an alpaca that grows soft spongy fiber, has natural crimp, thus making a naturally elastic yarn well-suited for knitting. Suri has no crimp and thus is a better fit for woven goods. The designer Armani has used Suri alpaca to fashion men's and women's suits. Alpaca fleece is made into various products, from very simple and inexpensive garments made by the indigenous communities to sophisticated, industrially made and expensive products such as suits.

40|$|AbstractIn {{recent years}} {{there have been}} several {{attempts}} to replace synthetic <b>fibers</b> with <b>natural</b> <b>fibers</b> in fiber reinforced composites, due to increasing environmental awareness and depletion of oil resources. The fact that <b>natural</b> <b>fibers</b> are available cheaply and in abundance, being biodegradable and low density, has motivated many researchers throughout the world to explore their application potential in various industrial sectors. However, natural fibres also have some limitations such as high moisture absorption and subsequent swelling and degradation, poor chemical and fire resistance, high dispersion of mechanical properties, poor interfacial interactions with polymeric or cementitious matrices, etc. Therefore, there is a huge concern to modify the surface of <b>natural</b> <b>fibers</b> through various techniques, in order to overcome their inherent drawbacks and to successfully utilize these materials in various applications.
