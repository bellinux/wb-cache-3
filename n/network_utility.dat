In 1966, he became a program manager in the ARPA Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO), where he led {{the development of the}} ARPANET, the first wide area packet switching network. Roberts applied Donald Davies' concepts of packet switching for the ARPANET, and also sought input from Paul Baran and Leonard Kleinrock. After Robert Taylor left ARPA in 1969, Roberts became director of the IPTO. In 1973, he left ARPA to commercialize the nascent technology in the form of Telenet, the first data <b>network</b> <b>utility,</b> and served as its CEO from 1973 to 1980. In 2012, Roberts was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society.|$|E

Unlike previous studies of incumbents in competitive markets, this qualitative multi-case {{study examines}} 18 electricity distribution <b>network</b> <b>utilities</b> who operate as regulated monopolies. Three important findings emerged from the study: firstly, that disruptive technologies in distributed electricity generation and storage are likely to trigger the creative destruction of existing natural monopolies and render incumbent business models unsustainable. Secondly, the task of adapting to disruptive technologies is made more challenging by the additional requirement to simultaneously transition from a monopolistic to competitive marketplace. Thirdly, incumbents face the risk of inertia and paralysis due to {{a broad range of}} rigidities and inhibitors which threaten to undermine their efforts to adapt, survive and avoid succumbing to a death spiral scenario...|$|R

40|$|In a <b>networked</b> <b>utility</b> setting (few, {{predominantly}} monopoly providers), it is {{very hard}} to measure the extent of grand corruption using perceptions or surveys. It is even harder to measure the extent of damage done specifically by corruption, petty or grand. As a result, it will be hard to develop "actionable indicators" of, or to develop empirically tested responses to, corruption in utilities. How much does this matter? Corruption is the result of a failure of governance. We can measure the impact of poor governance at the level of the utility, and we have a number of tools to improve their governance. It is not clear that, at the sectoral or company level, there is a significant anticorruption agenda not encompassed by this broader agenda of improved governance. To that extent, the "new" anticorruption agenda provides renewed justification for the "old" focus on institutions at the level of utilities management, but does not require a radically different approach. <b>Networked</b> <b>utilities</b> Corruption Monopoly providers Anticorruption agenda Governance...|$|R
