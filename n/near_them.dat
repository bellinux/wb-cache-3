5|$|Gate towers, one on {{each side}} of the gate and {{projecting}} out from the gate to allow defenders to shoot into the area in front of the entrance. The gates themselves were normally wooden with metal covering plates to prevent destruction by fire. Some gates had portcullises. Postern gates were built into towers or <b>near</b> <b>them</b> to allow sorties.|$|E
5|$|Many sponges shed Sponge spicules, {{forming a}} dense carpet several meters deep that keeps away {{echinoderms}} which would otherwise prey on the sponges. They also produce toxins that prevent other sessile organisms such as bryozoans or sea squirts from growing on or <b>near</b> <b>them,</b> making sponges very effective competitors for living space. One of many examples includes ageliferin.|$|E

In actuality, Harry is hiding at the wall <b>near</b> <b>them</b> and takes another drink of the vial of formula before walking off. Soon after, Peter returns to find the dance almost abandoned except for Mary Jane, who is dancing with another boy. Downtrodden, he is reassured when Mary Jane walks up to him and tells him that she saved the last dance for him.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the New Kingdom, a {{tradition}} had developed that Set had cut Osiris's body into pieces and scattered them across Egypt. Cult centers of Osiris all over the country claimed that the corpse, or particular pieces of it, were found <b>near</b> <b>them.</b> The dismembered parts could be said to number as many as forty-two, each piece being equated with one of the forty-two nomes, or provinces, in Egypt. Thus, the god of kingship becomes the embodiment of his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Parts of Juniata County {{are fairly}} flat, {{but there are}} areas in the county with slopes of 25% or greater. However, most {{development}} in the county is confined to areas with slopes of 15% or less. Many of the county's steepest slopes, with grades of 25% of more, are located {{on the edges of}} the county. These slopes are generally found on mountainous ridges. However, there are some similarly steep slopes {{in the middle of the}} county. All four boroughs in the county have slopes with a grade of 25% or more <b>near</b> <b>them.</b> Slopes of 15% to 25% can be found throughout the county.|$|E
5|$|Situated along vital air and sea {{lanes of}} {{communication}} {{in the middle of}} the Mediterranean, Crete was of considerable strategic importance to both sides and, after the conclusion of the campaign in Greece, the Allies fully expected that the Germans would attempt an invasion. The 4th Brigade was stationed as a reserve force in the area around Galatas with the 18th Battalion near the newly established general hospital. When the airborne invasion began on 20 May, the battalion quickly dealt with a company of Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) that landed <b>near</b> <b>them.</b> It carried out mopping up operations and patrolled the area for the next two days before assisting the 19th Battalion in an attack on Fallschirmjäger that had established a strong defensive position nearby.|$|E

5|$|The key {{geographical}} {{features that}} had influenced the landings also influenced {{the next phase}} of the battle: the draws, the natural exits off the beaches, were the main targets in the initial assault plan. The strongly concentrated defenses around these draws meant that the troops landing <b>near</b> <b>them</b> quickly became incapable of carrying out a further assault. In the areas between the draws, at the bluffs, units were able to land in greater strength. Defenses were also weaker away from the draws, thus most advances were made there.|$|E
5|$|Boys Don't Cry {{aired in}} Canada at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in September 1999. It premiered in the U.S. at the New York Film Festival on October 8, 1999, to {{critical}} acclaim. It was {{shown at the}} Reel Affirmations International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in early October, where it won further praise and appeared at the Venice International Film Festival. Boys Don't Cry was given a special screening in snippets at the Sundance Film Festival. At that time, the film was still called Take It Like a Man. The film received a limited release theatrically on October 22, 1999, in the U.S., where it was distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, a subsidiary of Twentieth Century Fox that specializes in independent films. Initially, many viewers complained via email to Peirce that the film was not being shown <b>near</b> <b>them,</b> as the film was only being shown on 25 screens across the country. However, this number increased to nearly 200 by March 2000. The film grossed $73,720 in its opening week. By December 5, the film had grossed in excess of $2 million. By May 2000, it had a U.S. total gross of $11,540,607—more than three times its production budget. Internationally, the film was released on March 2, 2000 in Australia and on April 9, 2000, in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} this {{migration}} have been observed {{in the ruins of}} burial sites left behind by the Iazyges, in that they lacked the standard items of gold being buried alongside a person, and even lacked the gear of a warrior. One explanation for this was that the Iazyges were no longer in contact with the Pontic Steppe, and thus cut off from all trade with them, which had previously been a vital part of their economy. Another problem the Iazyges had with their new location was that it lacked both precious minerals and metals, such as iron, that could be turned into weapons. The Iazyges found that it was much harder to raid the Romans, due to them having organized armies around the area, as opposed to the disorganization of the armies of their previous neighbors. Due to their trade with the Pontic Steppe being cut off, they could no longer trade for gold for burial sites, assuming any of them could afford it. The only such goods they could find were the pottery and metals of the Dacian and Celtic peoples <b>near</b> <b>them.</b> Iron weapons would have been exceedingly rare, if the Iazyges even had them, and would likely have been passed down from father to son, rather than buried, because it could not have been replaced.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately, the centrepieces of the {{pediment}} {{were destroyed}} even before Jacques Carrey created otherwise useful documentary drawings in 1674, so all reconstructions {{are subject to}} conjecture and speculation. The main Olympian gods must have stood around Zeus and Athena watching the wondrous event, with Hephaestus and Hera probably <b>near</b> <b>them.</b> The Carrey drawings are instrumental in reconstructing the sculptural arrangement beyond the centre figures {{to the north and}} south.|$|E

25|$|The rounded smooth {{shape of}} Bumastus, {{as well as}} the almost {{complete}} effacement of its cephalon, {{is believed to have been}} an adaptation for burrowing. The presence of well-developed eyes also suggest that it may have kept them above the substrate by burrowing into sediments backward. They are situated in such a way that they provide the trilobite with a semicircular field of vision on each side, keeping them aware of movements <b>near</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|Asplenium×trudellii, {{commonly}} known as Trudell's spleenwort, is a rare hybrid fern of the eastern United States, first described in 1925. It is formed by the crossing of mountain spleenwort (A.montanum) with lobed spleenwort (A.pinnatifidum). Trudell's spleenwort is intermediate in form between its two parents, and is generally found <b>near</b> <b>them,</b> growing on exposed outcrops of acidic rock. While A.×trudellii is triploid and sterile, {{there is some evidence}} that it can occasionally reproduce apogamously.|$|E

Therefore, before the dawn, the Roman light infantry disrupted the Gallic defences and, subsequently, the Roman heavy infantry and pikemen finished off their enemy. After the battle, Velitrae surrendered voluntarily to Rome. Back in Rome, Camillus celebrated with another Triumph.|$|E

25|$|The {{changing}} climate {{forced the}} Inuit {{to work their}} way south, forcing them into marginal niches along the edges of the tree line. These were areas which Native Americans had not occupied or where they were weak enough for the Inuit to live <b>near</b> <b>them.</b> Researchers have difficulty defining when Inuit stopped this territorial expansion. There is evidence that they were still moving into new territory in southern Labrador when they first began to interact with Europeans in the 17th century.|$|E
