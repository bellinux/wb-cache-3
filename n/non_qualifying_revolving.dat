50|$|Two {{of the key}} {{policies}} under PRWORA are {{the inclusion}} of immigrants in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Medicaid. In 2009, 22 states had extended TANF benefits and Medicaid to immigrants. Five states, California, Hawaii, Minnesota, New York, and Washington, provide assistance to some <b>non</b> <b>qualified</b> immigrants. Oftentimes, these policies have had discriminatory effects towards minorities. Race has a strong negative correlation for TANF assistance granted to immigrants. In addition, the immigrant population has a positive correlation with the inclusion of Medicaid coverage considering the positive correlation between higher poverty and inclusion.|$|R

However, these formulas were derived {{under the assumption}} of a normal distribution. Thus, the capital requirement estimated by the Basel formula may be incorrect when the asset distributions are not normal. Using an analysis of <b>qualifying</b> <b>revolving</b> retail exposures as an example, this paper introduces a formula based on the Extreme Value Theory to calculate the capital requirement. This formula is more general and accurate than its predecessors, {{because it can be}} used with any type of distribution. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate that the capital requirement estimated by the Basel formula is less than by our formula when the asset distribution has a heavy tail, and more than by our formula when the distribution has a short tail. Our formula is also more sensitive to risk than competing models {{in the context of the}} recent financial crisis. Basel accord Extreme Value Theory Capital requirement...|$|R

A bottom-up approach to the problem, with specific guidelines worked out at regional level is considered proper. The various aspects should be faced by the multidisciplinary equipe: each professional (physician, nurse, <b>non</b> <b>qualified</b> assistance person, physiotherapist, etc.) should known the problem (types of restraint means, indication and contra-indication, sequences) and {{be able to make a}} multidimensional evaluation of the necessities of the elder, putting them inside working groups. The physician should be in continuous contact with the others members of the team to verify the possibility of alternative strategies (ie enviromental changes, use of innovative nursing models) : only in the absence of alternatives will prescribe a restraint mean, having informed consent from the elder.

40|$|A {{secret sharing}} scheme permits a secret {{to be shared}} among {{participants}} {{in such a way}} that only qualified subsets of participants can recover the secret. If any <b>non</b> <b>qualified</b> subset has absolutely no information about the secret, then the scheme is called perfect. Unfortunately, in this case the size of the shares cannot be less than the size of the secret. Krawczyk [9] showed how to improve this bound in the case of computational threshold schemes by using Rabin's information dispersal algorithms [14], [15]. We show how to extend the information dispersal algorithm for general access structure (we call access structure, the set of all qualified subsets). We give bounds on the amount of information each participant must have. Then we apply this to construct computational schemes for general access structures. The size of shares each participant must have in our schemes is nearly minimal: it is equal to the minimal bound plus a piece of information whose length does not [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Most {{retirement}} plans (the exception being most <b>non</b> <b>qualified</b> plans) offer significant tax advantages. Most commonly the money {{contributed to the}} account is not taxed as income to the employee {{at the time of}} the contribution. In the case of employer provided plans, however, the employer is able to receive a tax deduction for the amount contributed as if it were regular employee compensation. This is known as pre-tax contributions, and the amounts allowed to be contributed vary significantly among various plan types. The other significant advantage is that the assets in the plan are allowed to grow through investing without the taxpayer being taxed on the annual growth year by year. Once the money is withdrawn it is taxed fully as income for the year of the withdrawal. There are many restrictions on contributions, especially with 401(k) and defined benefit plans. The restrictions are designed to make sure that highly compensated employees do not gain too much tax advantage at the expense of lesser paid employees.|$|R
