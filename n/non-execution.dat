That {{the article}} {{affecting}} private property secured by public acts, in the said pretended treaty, contains {{nothing more than}} a general permission, given by the said Warren Hastings, for confiscating such jaghires, or landed estates, with the modifications therein contained, [...] "as he [the Nabob] may find necessary," [...] but does not directly point at, or express by name, any of the landed possessions of the Nabob's mother. But soon after the signing of the said pretended treaty, (that is, on the 29th November, 1781,) it did appear that a principal object thereof was to enable the Nabob to seize upon the estates of his female parents aforesaid, which had been guarantied to them by the East India Company. And although in the treaty, or pretended treaty, aforesaid, nothing more is purported than to give a simple permission to the Nabob to seize upon and confiscate the estates, leaving the execution or <b>non-execution</b> of the same wholly to his discretion, yet it appears, by several letters from Nathaniel Middleton, Esquire, the Resident at the Court of Oude, of the 6th, 7th, and 9th of December, 1781, that no such discretion as expressed in the treaty was left, or intended to be left, with him, the said Nabob, but that the said article ought practically to have a construction of a directly contrary tendency: that, instead of considering the article as originating from the Nabob, and containing a power provided in his favor which he did not possess before, the confiscation of the jaghires aforesaid was to be considered as a measure originating from the English, and to be intended for their benefit, and, as such, that the execution was to be forced upon him; and the execution thereof was accordingly forced upon him. And the Resident, Middleton, on the Nabob's refusal to act in contradiction to his sworn engagement guarantied by the East India Company, and in the undutiful and unnatural manner required, did totally supersede his authority in his own dominions, considering himself as empowered so to act by the instructions of the said Hastings, although he had reason to apprehend a general insurrection in consequence thereof, and that he found it necessary to remove his family, [...] "which he did not wish to retain there, in case of a rupture with the Nabob, or the necessity of employing the British forces in the reduction of his aumils and troops"; and he did accordingly, as sovereign, issue his own edicts and warrants, in defiance of the resistance of the Nabob, in the manner by him described in the letters aforesaid,--in a letter of 6th December, 1781, that is to say: [...] "Finding the Nabob wavering in his determination about the resumption of the jaghires, I this day, in presence of and with the minister's concurrence, ordered the necessary purwannahs to be written to the several aumils for that purpose; and it was my firm resolution to have dispatched them this evening, with proper people to see them punctually and implicitly carried into execution; but before they were all transcribed, I received a message from the Nabob, who had been informed by the minister of the resolution I had taken, entreating that I would withhold the purwannahs until to-morrow morning, when he would attend me, and afford me satisfaction on this point. As the loss of a few hours in the dispatch of the purwannahs appeared of little moment, and as it is possible the Nabob, seeing that the business will at all events be done, may make it an act of his own, I have consented to indulge him in his request; but, be the remit of our interview whatever it may, nothing shall prevent the orders being issued to-morrow, either by him or myself, with the concurrence of the ministers. Your pleasure respecting the Begums I have learnt from Sir Elijah, and the measure heretofore proposed will soon follow the resumption of the jaghires. From both, or indeed from the former alone, I have no doubt of the complete liquidation of the Company's balance." [...] And also in another letter, of the 7th December, 1781: [...] "I had the honor to address you yesterday, informing you of the steps I had taken in regard to the resumption of the jaghires. This morning the Vizier came to me according to his agreement, but seemingly without any intention or desire to yield me satisfaction on the subject under discussion; for, after a great deal of conversation, consisting on his part of trifling evasion and puerile excuses for withholding his assent to the measure, though at the same time professing the most implicit submission to your wishes, I found myself without any other resource than the one of employing that exclusive authority with which I consider your instructions to vest me: I therefore declared to the Nabob, in presence of the minister and Mr. Johnson, who I desired might bear witness of the conversation, that I construed his rejection of the measure proposed as a breach of his solemn promise to you, and an unwillingness to yield that assistance which was evidently in his power towards liquidating his heavy accumulating debt to the Company, and that I must in consequence determine, in my own justification, to issue immediately the purwannahs, which had only been withheld in the sanguine hope that he would be prevailed upon to make that his own act which nothing but the most urgent necessity could force me to make mine. He left me without any reply, but afterwards sent for his minister and authorized him to give me hopes that my requisition would be complied with; on which I expressed my satisfaction, but declared that I could admit of no further delays, and, unless I received his Excellency's formal acquiescence before the evening, I should then most assuredly issue my purwannahs; which I have accordingly done, not having had any assurances from his Excellency that could justify a further suspension. I shall, as soon as possible, inform you of the effect of the purwannahs, which, in many parts, I am apprehensive it will be found necessary to enforce with military aid. I am not, however, entirely without hopes that the Nabob, when he sees the inefficacy of further opposition, may alter his conduct, and prevent the confusion and disagreeable consequences which would be too likely to result from the prosecution of a measure of such importance without his concurrence. His Excellency talks of going to Fyzabad, for the purpose heretofore mentioned, in three or four days: I wish he may be serious in his intention, and you may rest assured I shall spare no pains to keep him to it." [...] And further, in a letter of the 9th December, 1781: [...] "I had the honor to address you on the 7th instant, informing you of the conversation which had passed between the Nabob and me on the subject of resuming the jaghires, and the step I had taken in consequence. His Excellency appeared to be very much hurt and incensed at the measure, and loudly complains of the treachery of his ministers,--first, in giving you any hopes that such a measure would be adopted, and, secondly, in their promising me their whole support in carrying it through; but, as I apprehended, rather than suffer it to appear that the point had been carried in opposition to his will, he at length yielded a nominal acquiescence, and has this day issued his own purwannahs to that effect,--declaring, however, at the same time, both to me and his ministers, that it is an act of compulsion. I hope to be able in a few days, in consequence of this measure, to transmit you an account of the actual value and produce of the jaghires, opposed to the nominal amount at which they stand rated on the books of the circar." ...|$|E

The same study identified that 23% of reported trafficking cases of the Government attorney did not appear during the hearing.

In addition, there is gross lacking of awareness on gender issues, lack of conceptual clarity on trafficking issues, lack of skilled human resources, corruption, political pressure and lack of coordination among police and Government attorney. Another explanation to underreporting is that after trafficking raids in India, many women are immediately deported to their homelands before they can give evidence against traffickers. Finally, Nepal’s courts also have no jurisdiction over brothel owners in India, who are one of the main drivers of trafficking.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} limit order book (LOB) model with {{dynamics}} {{that account for}} both {{the impact of the}} most recent order and the shape of the LOB. We present an empirical analysis showing that the type of the last order significantly alters the submission rate of immediate future orders, even after accounting for the state of the LOB. To model these effects jointly we introduce a discrete Markov chain model. Then on these improved LOB dynamics, we find the policy for optimal order choice and placement in the share purchasing problem by framing it as a Markov decision process. The optimal policy derived numerically uses limit orders, cancellations and market orders. It looks to exploit the state of the LOB summarized by the volume at the bid/ask and the type of the most recent order to obtain the best execution price, avoiding <b>non-execution</b> and adverse selection risk simultaneously. Market orders are used aggressively when the mid-price is expected to move adversely. Limit orders are placed under favorable LOB conditions and canceled when <b>non-execution</b> or adverse selection probability is high.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the rationale for}} and profitably of limit order trading. Although limit orders {{are essential to the}} functioning of order driven markets, their use has received relatively little attention in the literature. Trading via limit order is, in fact, sub-optimal when transaction prices change solely in response to new information. We suggest that in an order driven market a paucity of limit orders can result in order imbalances causing the transaction price to move temporarily away and then revert to the true price. Such short term changes in transaction price can offset losses incurred by limit order traders because of permanent changes in transaction price due to information. Further, we suggest that the markets can be in ecological balance with liquidity driven price changes being just sufficient for the flow of market and limit orders to equilibrate. We use transaction data for the Dow Jones Industrial stocks for 1988 to compare a limit order strategy with a market order strategy, and find that limit order returns conditional on <b>non-execution</b> are lower. We also test the profitability of placing a network of buy and sell limit orders, and document the existence of a limit order spread that is appreciably greater than the posted bid-ask spread. Our findings suggest that trading via limit orders is desirable for participants who are willing to risk <b>non-execution,</b> and that trading via market orders is desirable for participants who are not willing to take the risk. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{inclusion}} {{of human rights}} clauses in EU international agreements {{has long been a}} traditional feature of human rights protection in EU external relations. In current practice, EU agreements containing human rights clauses follow a standard model. First, there is a reference in the preamble of the agreement to the ‘strong attachment’ of the contracting parties to non-trade values, such as democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law. Second, {{in the first part of}} the agreement there is a provision that defines the respect for human rights and other non-trade values as ‘essential element’ of the agreement. Third, a <b>non-execution</b> clause is included in the final part of most EU agreements, which stipulates how the EU is supposed react if an essential element of the agreement is violated. It is often observed that the violations of the values mentioned in the essential element clause have only triggered the application of the clause in a limited number of cases, all involving very serious violations of democratic principles and human rights. This infrequent application might thus call into question the real impact of the clause on the human rights situations of EU partner countries. However, the usefulness of the clause as a tool for the protection of human rights in EU external relations cannot be judged with exclusive reference to its enforcement record. On the one hand, the essential element clause and the <b>non-execution</b> clause establish a ‘self-contained regime’ allowing for the adoption of ‘appropriate measures’ to compel compliance. On the other hand, the essential element clause should also be evaluated per se, that is as an autonomous rule which can play a constructive role as a basis for political dialogue and for the adoption of positive measures. This paper examines the added value of the clause following this interpretative approach and contributes to the discussion of some problematic issues related to the clauses and to their enforcement...|$|E
