40|$|Although biofilm-based {{fungal infections}} are an {{important}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in patients, there is no standardized method for the in vitro evaluation of the drug susceptibility of biofilms. We investigated a high-throughput method for determining the susceptibility of Candida albicans biofilms that uses the oxidation reduction indicator Alamar blue (AB). Biofilms from the tested Candida albicans strains were markedly resistant to amphotericin B (AMB), nystatin (NYT), fluconazole (FLC) and 5 -fluorouracil (5 FC), but susceptible to Conflikt disin-fectant. The latter was used in comparative studies of AB reduction with two other methods for assessing in vitro drug susceptibility i. e., 2, 3 -bis(2 -methoxy- 4 -nitro- 5 -sulfophenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium- 5 -carboxanilide (XTT) reduction and enumeration of <b>viable</b> <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> (CFU/ml).

The interaction between aspirin and H pylori in vitro {{is also not}} clear. We investigated the effect of aspirin on the growth of H pylori and on the susceptibility, of H pylori to antimicrobials. Methods: Time killing studies of H pylori were performed with different concentrations of aspirin and salicylate. Growth of bacteria was assessed spectrophotometrically and by <b>viable</b> <b>colony</b> <b>count.</b> The effects of aspirin on the efficiency of colony formation and on metronidazole induced mutation to rifampicin resistance in H pylori were determined. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of aspirin and metronidazole were tested by the standard agar dilution method. MICs of amoxycillin and darithromycin were determined by the E test method. Results: Aspirin and salicylate inhibited the growth of H pylori in a dose dependent manner and bactericidal activity was due to cell lysis. Aspirin 400 μg/ml caused a 2 logs decrease in colony forming units/ml at 48 hours, and suppressed the normal ability of metronidazole to induce new mutations to rifampicin. The IC 90 of aspirin was 512 μg/ml. Increased susceptibility of amoxycillin, darithromycin, and metronidazole to H pylori was observed at 1 mM (1 80 μg/ml) aspirin.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the possible effects of aspirin and indometacin on the growth of H. pylori and to determine the effects of aspirin on the susceptibility of H. pylori to some antimicrobials. Methods: Kinetic studies were performed by inoculating strains of H. pylori in brucella broth with different concentrations of aspirin and indometacin. Growth of bacteria in the broth was assessed spectrophotometrically and by <b>viable</b> <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> after incubation for 24 and 48 h. Bacterial morphology was determined by Gram stain under light microscopy. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of aspirin and indometacin was determined by the standard agar dilution method. The MIC of amoxicillin, clarithromycin and metronidazole was measured in the presence and absence of aspirin by the E-test method. Results: Kinetic studies revealed that aspirin and indometacin inhibited the growth of H. pylori in a dose-dependent manner. The bactericidal activity of these agents was expressed by cell lysis. Aspirin at 400 μg/mL produced an almost 2 -log decrease in the number of CFU/mL at 48 h. Similar inhibitory effects were obtained when 100 μg/ml, indometacin was tested. The MIC at which 90 % of H. pylori was inhibited was 512 μg/mL and 128 μg/ml, for aspirin and indometacin, respectively. Increased susceptibility of H. pylori to amoxicillin, clarithromycin and metronidazole was found in the presence of aspirin. Conclusions: Aspirin and indometacin could significantly inhibit the growth of H. pylori when incubated in brucella broth in vitro.

The numbers of CFU/mL in Brucella broth containing 0. 09 mM SC- 236 were 2 log lower at 24 h, and even 3 log lower at 48 h than that at 0 h (P = 0. 035, compared with the vehicle control). Treatment of 0. 3 mM indometacin reduced the number of CFU/mL by 1 log at 24 h compared with that at 0 h (P = 0. 037 compared with the vehicle control). Helicobacter pylori urease activity began to decrease with 0. 06 mM SC- 236 at 24 h (P = 0. 016), and 0. 3 mM indometacin at 48 h (P = 0. 025). MICs of metronidazole and clarithromycin against H. pylori were decreased significantly in the presence of 0. 03 mM SC- 236 or 0. 1 mM indometacin (all P < 0. 001).

These strains were of expression class II, and 98 % of laboratories reported correct identifications in 1986. Performance in identifying two strains (strains A and D) of expression class I remained poor. Strain A was circulated in two surveys in 1987 and 1989, and laboratories were sent a questionnaire requesting details of the methods used in those two surveys. The methods used by the laboratories were classified into three categories: disk diffusion, single-plate screening by agar incorporation, and automated methods, which included premanufactured MIC panels.

Additional fish experiments sought to determine the effect of ECPs, which were injected i.m. and i.p. in 0.1  ml volume (0.1  mg of protein ml− 1). Control fish received 0.1  ml volume of sterile 0.85 % (w/v) saline. All fish were maintained in freshwater at 26 [*]±[*] 2 and 15 [*]±[*] 1  °C for tilapia and rainbow trout, respectively, and examined daily for 5  days. Any dead or clinically diseased fish were sampled microbiologically in which loopfuls of samples from kidney and spleen were streaked onto TSA plates with incubation at 28  °C for 24  h, and the resulting colonies identified as previously described. Also, spleen and kidney tissues were fixed in 10 % (v/v) neutral buffered formalin for 24  h before embedding in paraffin following routine tissue processing. Thus, 5 -µm-thick sections were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) (Oliveira Ribeiro et al. 1981) and Gram stained for histological examination. All slides were examined at a magnification of 400 × using a Carl Zeiss microscope.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundEndoscopy is a {{vital part}} of medical {{diagnostic}} processes. There are different kinds of flexible endoscopes used in medicine. They differ between manufacturers and even between models from the same manufacturer. However, all flexible endoscopes have the same basic components. Infections related to flexible endoscopic procedures are caused by either endogenous flora or exogenous microbes. The first major challenge of reprocessing is infection control, most episodes of infection can be traced to procedural errors in cleaning and disinfecting, the second major challenge is to protect personnel and patients from the exposure to liquid biocides used for disinfection. Because the endoscopic accessories have complex nature, attention and adherence to a validated protocol is critical for reprocessing endoscopic accessories. Bioburden is defined as the number of bacteria living on a surface that has not been sterilized. The term is most often used in the context of bioburden testing, also known as microbial limit testing, which is performed on pharmaceutical products and medical products for quality control purposes. Flexible endoscopes, by virtue of the types of body cavities they enter, acquire high levels of microbial contamination (bioburden) during each use. Aim of the workTo detect the average bioburden values on different parts of flexible gastrointestinal endoscopes after clinical use and cleaning in order to assess the efficiency of different cleaning processes used in the endoscopy unit. MethodsThe current study included a total of 120 endoscopes randomly selected from Medical Research Institute (MRI) hospital 60 (50 %) of which were from Surgical Department endoscopy unit, and 60 (50 %) of which were from Internal Medicine Department endoscopy unit. The endoscopes were divided as (40) endoscopes after use (40) endoscopes after manual cleaning, and (40) endoscopes after high level disinfection. All samples were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and for Candida species, the number of colonies were determined as colony forming units (cfu) /ml. ResultsMicroorganisms isolated immediately after use were Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides, whereas after manual cleaning the isolated strains were Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Bacteroides, and E. coli. The average Bioburden on endoscopy before cleaning ranged from 6 × 104 to 3. 7 × 108 cfu per device (mean cfu per device 1. 4 × 107), whereas after manual cleaning ranged from 2. 1 × 102 to 3. 5 × 103 cfu per device (mean cfu per device 4. 9 × 102) and no colonies were found after sterilization. Manual cleaning resulted in a mean of 4. 46 log 10 reduction in <b>viable</b> <b>colony</b> <b>count</b> and high level disinfection (HLD) resulted in a reduction of CFU to zero. ConclusionsHLD is superior to manual cleaning in the process of endoscopic disinfection. RecommendationsMicrobiological screening should be undertaken for all the Endoscopy Unit personnel responsible for cleaning or if there is a clinical suspicion of cross-infection related to endoscopy. All health-care personnel in an endoscopy unit in standard infection control should be trained to reprocess endoscopes. Safe working practices in the decontamination area of each unit should be written down and understood by all staff...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether time to detection (TTD) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in BACTEC Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) 960 and BACTEC 460 TB {{systems can be}} used as an alternative to colony-forming unit (cfu) counting. DESIGN: A single sputum sample recovered from each of 22 patients with tuberculosis (TB) was cultured on Middlebrook 7 H 11 agar and in BACTEC MGIT 960 and BACTEC 460 to investigate the relationship between cfu/ml and TTD. The relationship between TTD and treatment response was investigated by culturing a single sputum sample from each of 125 patients with TB in the BACTEC 460 system and comparing TTD values with their treatment response. RESULTS: An inverse correlation between TTD and bacterial number, as assessed by inoculum size and cfu/ml, was observed. For the 125 patients followed up during treatment, TTD values at diagnosis correlated with smear conversion rates at 2 months and treatment outcomes. Drug resistance of the infecting strain was associated with decreased killing, as indicated by the delayed increase in TTD during {{the first few days of}} treatment. CONCLUSION: The TTD of M. tuberculosis in BACTEC MGIT 960 and BACTEC 460 TB systems is a <b>viable</b> alternative to <b>colony</b> <b>counting.</b> TTD in liquid culture will facilitate mycobacterial quantification, especially in the evaluation of early bactericidal activity. © 2008 The Union.

40|$|Many enteric {{pathogens}} {{are thought}} to enter a viable but nonculturable state when deprived of nutrients. Virulent strains of the enteric pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus are rarely isolated from their low-nutrient aquatic environments, possibly due to their nonculturability. Host factors such as bile may trigger release from dormancy and increase virulence in these strains. In this study, the addition of bile or the bile acid deoxycholic acid to estuarine water-cultured bacteria led {{to an increase in}} the direct <b>viable</b> <b>count</b> and <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> among the virulent strains. This effect was not demonstrated in the nonvirulent strains, and it was reversed by extraction of bile acids with cholestyramine. Bile-treated V. parahaemolyticus had lower levels of intracellular calcium than untreated cells, and this effect coincided with {{an increase in the number}} of metabolically active cells. Chelation of intracellular calcium with BAPTA/AM (R. Y. Tsien, Biochemistry 19 : 2396 - 2402, 1980) produced similar results. Addition of bile to V. parahaemolyticus cultures in laboratory medium enhanced factors associated with virulence such as Congo red binding, bacterial capsule size, and adherence to epithelial cells. These results suggest that a bile acid-containing environment such as that found in the human host favors growth of virulent strains of V. parahaemolyticus and that bile acids enhance the expression of virulence factors. These effects seem to be mediated by a decrease in intracellular calcium...|$|R
40|$|Two {{methods of}} {{inoculum}} preparation for filamentous fungi were compared: counting with a hematocytometer and spectrophotometric adjustment.

40|$|The {{potential}} clinical {{value of}} <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> {{determined by the}} lysis-centrifugation blood culture method was studied by reviewing the records of eight patients with persistent septicemia in whom <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> were available on at least 3 days. <b>Colony</b> <b>counts</b> of the five patients who survived decreased steadily as the patients improved. One of the three patients who died had counts repeatedly below 1. 0 CFU/ml while she was clinically stable and higher counts when her condition deteriorated. Two patients died despite decreasing <b>colony</b> <b>counts.</b> One was improving and died unexpectedly of an unrelated cause; the other died of candidiasis, but declining serial arabinitol/creatinine ratios suggested a partial response to therapy. In addition, septicemia related to infected intravenous catheters was documented by demonstrating large differences in <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> determined simultaneously from two different sites in two patients and by demonstrating a precipitous drop in CFU per milliliter after removal of the infected catheter in one patient.

40|$|Spring water bottled {{and sold}} for human {{consumption}} can only be subjected to certain treatment processes such as separation from unstable constituents by decantation, filtration and aeration, ultraviolet irradiation and ozonation. A spring water distribution system in the Western Cape, South Africa was experiencing microbiological problems. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate bacterial contamination in the spring water distribution system and the application of bioremediation as treatment technology. Sampling at various points in the spring water distribution bottling system started in February 2004 and continued until November 2004. The acceptable microbiological limits for bottled spring water clearly states that the total <b>viable</b> <b>colony</b> <b>count</b> should be < 100 organisms per ml of water. Analysis of samples by the heterotrophic plate count (HPC) technique indicated significantly (p < 0. 05) high counts which did not conform to the microbiological limit. The heterotrophic plate counts recorded for weeks one, four, eight & 46 in the final bottled water (Site J) were 3. 66 x 107 cfu/ml, 9. 0 x 106 cfu/ml, 2. 35 x 107 cfu/ml and 5. 00 x 104 cfu/ml, respectively. The total cell counts [Flow cytometry analyses (FCM) ] recorded for week one, four, eight & 46 in the final bottled water (Site J) were 5. 44 x 107 microorganisms/ml, 8. 36 x 107 microorganisms/ml, 9. 09 x 107 microorganisms/ml and 5. 70 x 107 microorganisms/ml, respectively. The higher viable total cell counts(FCM) indicate that flow cytometry was able to detect cells in the water sample that enter a viable but not culturable state and that the heterotrophic plate count technique only allowed for the growth of the viable and culturable cells present in the water samples. This indicated that the HPC is not a clear indication of the actual microbial population in the water samples. It could be concluded that FCM technique was a more reliable technique for the enumeration of microbial populations in bottled water samples. Various organisms were identified by means of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using 16 S rRNA specific primers. Purified PCR amplicons were sequenced and Phylogenetic trees were constructed. Neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree analysis of the bacterial species present in the water samples was performed. The dominant bacterial isolates that were sequenced from the various water samples throughout weeks one, four, eight and 46 were Bacillus sp. and Enterobacteriaceae. The pathogenic species isolated throughout the sampling period included Escherichia sp., Pseudomonas sp., Shigella boydii, Bacillus and Staphylococcus sp. A laboratory-scale bioreactor was constructed and water samples were analysed over a period of two weeks. Water samples were analysed using FCM and Direct Acridine Orange Count (DAOC) in conjunction with epiflourescence microscopy (EM). The FCM counts ranged from 1. 53 x 107 microorganisms/ml in the initial sample (Day 0) to 1. 16 x 107 microorganisms/mℓ in the final sample (Day 13). The results indicated a 24 % decrease in the microbial numbers however, it was still above the limit of < 100 organisms/ml as set out by the South African Standards of Bottled Water, (2003). The total cell counts obtained by the DAOC method ranged from 1. 43 x 106 microorganisms/ml to 9. 54 x 105 microorganism/ml on day 13 (final). The results indicated a 33 % decrease in microbial numbers. The total cell counts analysed by flow cytometry fluctuated throughout the sampling period. The total cell counts obtained from the DAOC method were lower in all the water samples when compared to the total counts obtained by flow cytometric analyses. Even though the FCM counts fluctuated throughout the sampling period, results clearly show that the FCM method yielded more accurate data for total cell counts than the DAOC method. Due to external environmental conditions such as changes in the weather conditions the results fluctuated and the final results clearly indicated that further studies are required to optimise the bioreactor system for its application in the spring water industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} oxygen limitation, low redox potential, and high NaCl stress for 7 days in vitro on the rifampin-resistant {{biocontrol}} inoculant Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA 0 -Rif and its subsequent persistence in natural soil for 54 days were investigated. Throughout the experiment, the strain was monitored using total cell counts (immunofluorescence microscopy), Kogure's direct <b>viable</b> <b>counts,</b> and <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> (on rifampin-containing plates). Under in vitro conditions, viable-but-nonculturable (VBNC) cells of CHA 0 -Rif were obtained when the strain {{was exposed to}} a combination of low redox potential (230 mV) and oxygen limitation. This mimics a situation observed in the field, where VBNC cells of the strain were found in the waterlogged soil layer above the plow pan. Here, VBNC cells were also observed in vitro when CHA 0 -Rif was subjected to high NaCl levels (i. e., NaCl at 1. 5 M but not 0. 7 M). In all treatments, cell numbers remained close to the inoculum level for the first 12 days after inoculation of soil, regardless of the cell enumeration method used, but decreased afterwards. At the last two samplings in soil, VBNC cells of CHA 0 -Rif were found in all treatments except the one in which log-phase cells had been used. In the two treatments that generated high numbers of VBNC cells in vitro, VBNC cells did not display enhanced persistence compared with culturable cells once introduced into soil, which suggests that this VBNC state did not represent a physiological strategy to improve survival under adverse conditions...|$|R
