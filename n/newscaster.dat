40|$|This is a {{preliminary}} and exploratory study aimed {{to examine and}} quantify speaking and articulation rate among professional Hebrew speaking radio <b>newscasters.</b> Nineteen radio <b>newscasters</b> (ten men and nine women) were digitally recorded during live public broadcasts. The <b>newscasters</b> were assigned to two age-groups: “younger” (under 30 years) and “older” (over 58 years). All recordings were first transcribed and then analyzed acoustically to measure overall speaking rate, speaking rate within-item, articulation rate, pause duration and percentage of disfluency. The average speaking rate obtained for the entire group was 5. 90 Syllable-per-Second, and average articulation rate was 6. 42. No {{differences were found between}} men and women for any of the observed measures, and no age-group differences were found.
