40|$|Nuclear data {{validation}} involves a large suite of Integral Experiments (IEs) for criticality, reactor physics and dosimetry applications. [1] Often benchmarks {{are taken from}} international Handbooks. [2, 3] Depending on the application, IEs have different degrees of usefulness in validation, and usually {{the use of a}} single benchmark is not advised; indeed, it may lead to erroneous interpretation and results.

The approach is based on well-known General Linear Least Squared Method (GLLSM) extended to establish biases and uncertainties for given cross sections (within a given energy interval). The statistical treatment results in a vector of weighting factors for the integral benchmarks.
