40|$|During coffee drying, {{different}} temperatures {{applied to}} the beans with varied humidity content levels can interfere in the membranes integrity, germination, organic acid and carbohydrate content resulting in coffees with distinct flavors.

This work has an objective to study alternative methods for the dehydration o f the coffee beans using ultra-drying followed by slow drying {{and its impact on the}} sensorial quality, chemical composition and physiology. For that purpose, coffee lots were processed by the methods, dry (<b>natural</b> <b>coffee)</b> and wet (fully washed coffee); and sun-dried and machine-dried at a constant 60 °C temperature and alternating 60 / 40 °C. The sensory quality of the samples was assessed by the Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA) analysis protocol. The sugar, total titratable acidity and the phenolic compound content was also analyzed. The physiological alterations of the coffee beans were analyzed by germination tests, emergence speed index, electrical conductivity and potassium leaching. The temperature of the drying air significantly altered the sensorial quality of the coffee beans. The processing way associated to drying methods causes many physiological alterations with the highest damage observed in the natural coffees. For the first time, we are showing that drying with heated air at 60 / 40 ºC is promising for the fully washed coffee beans, which are more tolerant to dehydration than the <b>natural</b> <b>coffee</b> beans. Conversely, the <b>natural</b> <b>coffee</b> beans were much more sensitive to drying regardless the temperature, with very low performance in the physiological analyses.

40|$|International audienceArabica {{coffee is}} a major {{agricultural}} commodity worldwide, representing 60  % of the world’s coffee production. Arabica coffee is cultivated in more than 36 countries and is a key cash crop for many developing countries. Despite the coffee’s huge economic importance, there is very limited knowledge on the association of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi with coffee roots. Therefore, we assessed the mycorrhizal diversity and community composition in Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica L.), using 454 pyrosequencing, in its Ethiopian center of origin. We studied the five most common coffee management systems in Ethiopia. Using pyrosequencing, we retrieved 10, 061 mycorrhizae sequences across 30 samples, generating 36 operational taxonomic units from the four mycorrhizae orders: Glomerales, Diversisporales, Archaeosporales, and Paraglomerales; and eight families. Our results show that mycorrhizal diversity strongly differed between natural forest coffee systems and the other management systems. Furthermore, 13 operational taxonomic units were uniquely found in natural forest coffee. Finally, the mycorrhizal community composition in shade coffee plantations {{was different from the}} community composition in the other managed systems and the natural forest coffee systems. This is the first in depth study of mycorrhizal communities in wild coffee in its Ethiopian region of origin.

This research aimed to evaluate the biochemical performance of arabica coffee during storage.

Enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, polyphenoloxidase, esterase and lipoxygenase in coffee grains were evaluated at zero, three, six, nine and twelve months by means of electrophoresis.

40|$|Phosphate-solubilising rhizobacteria {{associated}} with Coffea arabica L. in <b>natural</b> <b>coffee</b> forests of southwestern Ethiopia were investigated. The main {{purpose was to}} screen for potential microbial biofertilisers by assessing isolated strains for phosphate solubilisation efficiency and organic acid production in different media. Initial screening was performed on Pikovskaya’s agar (PA). Quantitative colorimetric estimations of mobilised phosphate were made in different broth media {{in the presence of}} two phosphate sources. HPLC was employed for the detection of organic acids. From a total of 395 rhizobacterial isolates tested for P solubilisation, over 72 % (mostly Pseudomonas spp.) formed visible dissolution haloes on PA. Two Erwinia species and a P. chlororaphis strain produced the largest solubilisation indices and also solubilised hydroxyapatite strongly in broth medium. Solubilisation of hydroxyapatite (HAP) /tricalcium phosphate (TCP) by all isolates coincided with a decrease in medium pH. HPLC analyses of culture supernatants confirmed the presence of several organic acids, with 2 -ketogluconic acid dominating. The production of organic acids by these coffee-associated phosphobacteria could be considered the major mechanism involved in the solubilisation of insoluble HAP/TCP. Certain isolates deserve particular attention for bioinoculant development due to their remarkable efficiency of insoluble phosphate solubilisation. The present study could therefore be important with respect to screening of Coffea arabica-associated rhizobacteria that possess direct plant growth-promoting traits for extending the use of indigenous microbes as microbial biofertilisers...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the distribution of fungi in Coffea arabica L. (Arabica coffee) and Coffea canephora L. var. robusta (Robusta coffee) green coffee samples obtained from different sources at the pre-roasting stage. Twenty-eight green coffee samples from different countries of origin (Brazil, Timor, Honduras, Angola, Vietnam, Costa Rica, Colombia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, India, and Uganda) were evaluated. The fungal load in the contaminated samples ranged from 0 to 12330 colony forming units (CFU) /g, of which approximately 67 % presented contamination levels below 1500 CFU/g, while 11 % exhibited intermediate contamination levels between 1500 and 3000 CFU/g. Contamination levels higher than 3000 CFU/g were found in 22 % of contaminated coffee samples. Fifteen different fungi were isolated by culture-based methods and Aspergillus species belonging to different sections (complexes). The predominant Aspergillus section detected was Nigri (39 %), followed by Aspergillus section Circumdati (29 %). Molecular analysis detected the presence of Aspergillus sections Fumigati and Circumdati. The% coffee samples where Aspergillus species were identified by culture-based methods were 96 %. Data demonstrated that green coffee beans samples were contaminated with toxigenic fungal species. Since mycotoxins may be resistant to the roasting process, this suggests possible exposure to mycotoxins through consumption of coffee.
